Bahrain, Saudi Arabia & Egypt cut diplomatic ties with Qatar
	

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed their ties with Qatar on Monday, accusing the wealthy Gulf Arab state of supporting terrorism. 

The coordinated move dramatically escalates a simmering dispute over Qatars support of the Muslim Brotherhood, the worlds oldest Islamist movement, and adds accusations that Doha even backs the agenda of regional arch-rival Iran. 
The three Gulf states announced the closure of transport ties with Qatar and gave Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave their countries. 
Saudi Arabia accused Qatar of backing militant groups and spreading their violent ideology, in an apparent reference to its influential state-owned satellitechannel al Jazeera. 
(Qatar) embraces multiple terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at disturbing stability in the region, including the Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS (Islamic State) and al-Qaeda, and promotes the message and schemes of these groups through their media constantly, state news agency SPA said. 
The statement went on to accuse Qatar of supporting what it described as Iranian-backed militants in its restive and largely Shiite Muslim-populated Eastern region of Qatif and in Bahrain.

A certain Diyawanna member is said to be spending most of his time in the office of an official connected to a leading political authority whenever the council is in session.

Instead of faithfully following the proceedings of the council this member would visit this office located on the second floor of the august building complex to explain to the influential official the grandiose plans he has chalked out for implementation once he was appointed a purohita.
This member looking forward to getting some portfolio at least at the next reshuffle of the Deputies and State Ones is obviously trying to achieve his ambition through the influence of this official, they say.

A tense situation prevailed at the Aralaganwilla area following the discovery of hundreds of animal skulls from a garbage dump.
The residents of the area had launch a protest against the discovery, obstructing the Maduru Oya-Polonnaruwa Main Road, accusing the Pradeshiya Sabha authorities of dumping the skulls and remains of dogs that had been killed.
The residents suspect that an operation to kill and sell dog meat was going on in the area right under the noses of the Pradeshiya Sabha members.
However, Public Health Inspectors who visited the location after being informed of the situation by the Aralaganwila Police, had said the skulls were that of goats and not dogs.
Aralaganwilla Police OIC Inspector Lasantha Bandara told Daily Mirror that the mutton supplier to the Army has dumped the remains of the goats onto the garbage dump, which he insisted was a site authorised for garbage dumping.
However, when contacted, Army Spokesman Brigadier Roshan Seneviratna contradicted the OIC and said the Army was not consuming mutton and that the only authorised meat that they consume was chicken.
Meanwhile, the Aralaganwilla Police said that they were conducting an investigation into the matter. (Thilanka Kanakarathna and Darshana Sanjeewa)

Mexico ruling party seen scraping to victory in key state vote
	
REUTERS, 05th JUNE, 2017- Mexicos ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) likely won a key state election on Sunday by a slim margin, according to an official preliminary projection of results that was quickly challenged by the leftist party seen in second place. An early count from the State of Mexicos electoral institute projected PRI candidate Alfredo del Mazo as winning between 32.75 percent and 33.59 percent of the vote.
The candidate of Andres Manuel Lopez Obradors National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) was seen taking between 30.73 and 31.53 percent.
If the forecast is correct it will have been a close call for President Enrique Pena Nietos PRI, which has governed the state for nearly nine decades, and will not end the aspirations of Lopez Obrador, a veteran leftist who has led early opinion polls for the July 2018 presidential race.
Lopez Obrador said the rapid count did not correspond with reality and that he did not accept it. The Mexican peso reversed earlier losses and strengthened 0.4 percent after the states electoral institute announced the preliminary projections.
The State of Mexico is home to one in eight Mexican voters and victory there would provide the combative former mayor of Mexico City with a springboard to the top job.

Member of the Monetary Board Mrs. Manohari Ramanadan testifying before the Bond Commission yesterday said there was no concrete decision made at the Monetary Board meeting on February 23, 2015 to go for a thirty year bond issuance which took place on February 27, 2015.
There was a Monetary Board meeting on February 23, 2015 prior to the controversial thirty year bond auction.
According to Mrs. Ramanadan, it was also revealed that the minutes (summary of proceedings), relating to the Monetary Board meeting on February 23, which was approved later on March 6, 2015 had not reflected what really took place at the earlier meeting.
When questioned as to why she had subsequently approved the minutes, Mrs. Ramanadan said that thirty year bond had already happened at the time of the minutes regarding the meeting held on February 23 were approved.
Commenting on the Direct Placements method, Mrs. Ramanadan said there was no decision made by the Monetary Board to suspend or stop the Direct Placement method, which was largely used to raise funds for the Central Bank.
She was also of the view that if the Central Bank was to change radically its fund raising method of Direct Placement, such decision should have been considered by the Monetary Board.
However, when the witness was cross examined by Senior Counsel Shanaka de Silva it was explained that generally the decisions on issuances of bonds were not coming before the Monetary Board for its decisions on such issuances and it was clarified that the Public Debt Department decides on such issuances and then brings it to the attention of the Monetary Board.

Some minor employees of a state-owned undertaking related to aviation had quit their jobs expressing their disgust at the shabby treatment meted out to them by a female high-up.

Later these persons had complained to the purohita who recommended them for employment in the State-owned undertaking that they had to give up their jobs due to harassment they had to suffer at the hands of the female high-up.
Livid on hearing that his men were ill-treated, the purohita had openly berated the female high-up pointing out that those holding high office should be human enough to be kind to minor employees.
Affronted by the purohitas harangue, the female high-up had pruned the uniform entitlement to new recruits soon afterwards and has turned harder on minor employee who happen to be the purohitas chit appointees. She would tell them: Remember, politicians come and go, but we go on working here.

Deputy Chief Commissioner Attorney-at-Law Janaprith Fernando stated that the Secretary General of the World Organisation of the Scout Movement (WOSM) Mr. Ahmed Alhendawi joined a meeting of the SL Scout Flood Relief Team via SKYPE and discussed the work being carried out, and pledged immediate and further contributions from the WOSM and the Asia Pacific Region. Mr. Alhendawi also requested the SLSA to prepare project proposals to be supported by the Messengers of Peace, which is an arm of WOSM. 
The SLSA stated that their next step is to identify some schools and support them fully in infrastructure, counseling and providing requirements of teachers and students to resume their school activities, and called upon the former scouts, scouts, parents and the general public to assist in any way possible.

DAILY MAIL, 05th JUNE, 2017- President Donald Trump said Sunday he would do whatever is necessary to protect the United States from a vile enemy that he says has waged war on innocents for too long, vowing: This bloodshed must end, this bloodshed will end.
Trump commented on the vehicle and knife attack that killed at least seven people in London at the conclusion of a fundraiser for Fords Theater, scene of one of the most famous acts of bloodshed in American history: the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln.
America sends our thoughts and prayers and our deepest sympathies to the victims of this evil slaughter and we renew our resolve, stronger than ever before, to protect the United States and its allies from a vile enemy that has waged war on innocent life, and its gone on too long, Trump said in his first public comments on the attack late Saturday in a busy section of London.
