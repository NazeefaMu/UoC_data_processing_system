While lashing out at Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for presenting a new set of Constitutional reforms on Friday, the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said that it would not allow the Prime Minister to hoodwink the people as he used to hoodwink the United National Party (UNP).
JHU General Secretary, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said that the Prime Minister had inserted new clauses in the Constitutional reforms, which was different from the draft already submitted in the Supreme Court.
He said the intention of these reforms was to create an authoritative Prime Ministerial post with executive powers.
"Mr. Wickremesinghe changed the UNP Constitution in 1995. He is the party leader even today as there is no room for democracy in his party. He may have deceived the UNP but he cant deceive us. We wont allow him to deceive the people, Minister Ranawaka said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH

Stepping to international accounting standards is a big decision as it helps create global transparency and gain access to global capital markets. It is also an essential aspect for the growth of Sri Lankan economy in the long run, stressed Puype.
IFRS in important for both the banks as we are now challenging the status core and not being hesitant to venture into new areas added the HNB Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles.
Providence Holdings (Pvt) Ltd Director Dr. Vaz Gnanam said that they saw benefits in bringing IFRS to Sri Lanka.
Puype in the meantime appreciated the work of the banking industry of Sri Lanka. One of the best things about the banking community of Sri Lanka is, they take time to make decisions, but when they do it is a big one.
He also spoke about the importance of always adapting to the changes of the international accounting standards. Together with Providence we have been organizing conferences and workshops about informing the financial community about the implications of IFRS at an annual basis said Chris talking about the measures taken by WKFS along with Providence Holdings in the past.
We are not just selling the system and walking away, we have an obligation, we are safeguarding the financial industry and it is our responsibility to ensure that the system always correspondents to the changes happening in terms of risk, finance or compliance he further added while reassuring.
Addressing the gathering Alles also spoke about the trust they have invested in WKFS towards the successful implementation of the project following the singed agreement.
It is in your interest to make this an absolute beacon of a project, other bankers might even get on board during the implementation Alles told Puype.
It wasnt the easiest thing to zero in on, it was a moving target for the last two years in terms of exactly what we wanted, he stated.
He also spoke also about the necessity of a local partner. The reason as to why we have a local partner involved is because we need commitment and support there are changes we anticipate over the next 3-5 years.
I look forward to meticulous action planning timely implementation of the project so that starting from 2016 we will be fully on IFRS he concluded.

Rejecting claims of external influence to prevent the interview from being telecast, ITN Working Director Dhanushka Ramanayake said the decision was taken following instructions of the institutes legal advisors and the decision was taken only to suspend the interview and not to stop.

Sun, humidity and UV push up heat, says Met Dept.
	
Increasing in UV radiation, the sun coming directly over the country and the increase of humidity had contributed to the increase in the heat-wave experience in the country these days, the Department of Metrology said today.
The temperature has topped 36 degrees in some areas the country.
A Spokesman of the department told the Daily Mirror that usually excess radiation was blocked by cloud cover over the island.
However, a certain amount of radiation travels to the surface but was absorbed by the soil, while the remaining bounce back into space.
He said, however, these days the cloud cover over the country had prevented the escape of that extra radiation increasing in the heat.
The second reason is the sun coming directly over Sri Lanka. The sun which had come directly over Sri Lanka from today is to remain above the country till April 15. The sun is expected come above Denagama in Panadura today, he said.
The third reason was the excessive humidity in the air.
The department said that people feel a discomfort when sweating because the perspiration fails to get absorbed into the air in the form of humidity, which is a usual phenomenon.
This failure took place as more humidity couldnt be absorbed into the air.
The department said chances of thunder storms in the coming days are remote though light showers could be expected. (Yohan Perera)

Amid controversy over the opposition leader post in Parliament, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) yesterday staked its claim for the post saying that it was the single largest party outside the government in the House.
TNA leader R. Sampanthan told Daily Mirror that the United National Party (UNP), the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), the Tamil National Alliance or Ilankai Tamil Arachu Katchchi(ITAK) , and the Democratic National Alliance(DNA) were the only four parties having parliamentary representation at the moment.
However, he said both the UNP and the UPFA had got together to form the new government and, therefore, the TNA with 13 MPs was the opposition party with the greatest number of members.
Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) leader Dinesh Gunawardane cannot ask for it because his party contested under the betel symbol of the UPFA. The UPFA is part of the government now. So we are the largest party in the opposition, he said.
However Mr. Sampanthan said it was a matter for Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa to decide on.
Already, moves are underway to secure the post for Mr. Gunawardane backed by a section of UPFA MPs.
The Speaker is expected to announce his ruling tomorrow.(KB)
