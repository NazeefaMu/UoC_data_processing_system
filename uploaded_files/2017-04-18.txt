Are Trump-aide Bannon?s days numbered?
	
(Daily Mail, Australia), 17.04.2017 - While Donald Trump?s Chief Strategist Steve Bannon remains at the White House, there?s ample evidence that he?s been cast out of the president?s inner circle. ?
?Vanity Fair? did a deep dive on Bannon?s rift with Trump?s son-in-law Jared Kushner and found that Trump was fed up that his top aide was casting Kushner and his daughter Ivanka Trump as liberals, taking credit for the president?s popularity and saying he had conservatives in Congress under control during the health care reform push ? when Bannon really did not.More superficially, Frank Bruni in a New York Times column titled ?Steve Bannon was doomed,? noted that not only did the slobbish Bannon pick a fight with Trump?s kin, but he did so with the sharply-dressed and svelte Kushner. ?

British PM announces snap general election
	
British Prime Minister Theresa May has called an early general election for June 8 in an announcement that has stunned Westminster, The Telegraph reported a short while ago.
The Prime Minister had earlier repeatedly denied that she would call an election before the next scheduled poll in 2020.
However, speaking outside the Prime Minister's Office, she said the Cabinet had agreed to call an early election.
The move takes place against the backdrop of the country's decision to leave the European Union in last year's referendum.
Justifying the decision, Mrs May said "The country is coming together but Westminster is not. Division in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit,"

It would take four to five days to bring back the broken Phase 1 of the Noraichcholai Lakvijaya Thermal Power Plant back to operation, Power Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
?Meanwhile Phase I and III will provide electricity to the national grid,? he said a media briefing at the Norochcholai Thermal Power plant premises today.
The power failure occurred in several areas last morning due to the breakdown of a power generator in the Phase I of the Noraichcholai Coal power station yesterday.
?The Noraichcholai has broken down about 37 times so far and the all the repairs had being done by our engineers. But this time we need Chinese engineers,? Minister Siyambalapitiya said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Garbage: Adopt Gota?s proposal, says PHU
	
The best solution for Colombo's garbage disposal quagmire was given by former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the government should implement it without being fixated on who will receive the credit, MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.
He said dumping garbage at Karadiyana or somewhere else was not the best solution to this crisis.
He said Mr. Rajapaksa had suggested that the garbage collected daily within the Colombo Municipal Council limits and those already piled up at Meethotamulla and Bloemendhal be transported by train to the Aruwakkalu limestone quarry in Puttalam.
?Mr. Rajapaksa had suggested that the limestone pits be turned to ?sanitary land fills? prior to depositing garbage in them. Cabinet approval was given to the proposal in August 2014 and Rs.2 billion allocated in the 2015 budget for the project. However, with the change of government, the project was abandoned,? he told a news conference organised by the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya.
Mr. Gammanpila said the government had claimed that the project had hit a snag after the Wildlife Department had opposed it because some of the limestone pits were situated within the Wilpattu National Park buffer zone.
"Although unauthorised human activities are banned within a buffer zone, activities approved by the authorities can be carried out or otherwise the buffer zone could be moved 300 meters towards the perimeter of the national park,? he said.
Referring to the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry?s announcement that it would not permit garbage to be dumped on Urban Development Authority (UDA) lands, Mr. Gammanpila said it was not a solution and the UDA should assist the local government (LG) authorities by providing expertise when disposing garbage.
"The LG bodies are not capable of handling this crisis alone. This is an act of side stepping the issue,? he said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Gammanpila said western Province Chief Minister and Megapolis Minister don?t see eye to eye when it came to the garbage crisis in Colombo. ?However, the President also remains silent by allowing the two to work things out which will never happen,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Govt. agrees to release more military-occupied land: TNA
	
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) said yesterday the Government had assured it would release several more blocks lands occupied by the security forces in the North and East.
TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran said the lands to be released would be identified after discussions were held with the district secretaries of Mullaitivu, Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya and Mannar districts, the Tri-forces Chiefs, district politicians and the residents on April 19 and 20 .
?People in the North and East are protesting against the delay in releasing their lands which are still being occupied by the security forces even though the war ended nearly eight years ago. The Army Commander told us they were acting on the instructions of the President and the Defense Secretary with regard to the need to early release of the lands. He said gradually the lands occupied by the security forces will also be released,? Mr. Sumanthiran told a news conference.
He told a news conference that discussions would be held at district level to identify the exact lands that could be released to the original owners.
Mr. Sumanthiran said a final decision on the extent of lands to be released would be taken at a discussion to be held in Colombo early next month. (Ajith Siriwardana)

The government has not yet decided on the final amount of compensation to be paid to the victims of the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said yesterday.
Responding to a question asked during a news conference, the minister clarified the sum of Rs.2.5 million for those whose properties were damaged and Rs.100,000 on behalf of the deceased were insurance benefits and not compensation.
?This is a payment method of insurance for natural disasters. However, I can?t specifically make a statement on the amount announced by the Finance Ministry and we have not decided on the amount of compensation yet. Even President Mathripala Sirisena instructed us to hold discussions every three days. The President will chair these discussions. We are still engaged in the process,? he said.
He said the government had taken an additional step by bearing the cost of funerals.
? However the compensation amount will be higher than the insurance payment because a house cannot be valued below Rs.2.5 million,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Indika Sri Aravinda)

Report on fee hike for SL helpers misleading: Envoy
	
Reports of a hefty rise in recruitment fees for Sri Lankan domestic helpers, including maids, are misleading, said Sri Lankan Ambassador Azmi Thassim on Sunday.
?The Sri Lankan government is not involved in the hike of recruitment fees because business transactions are done by private Saudi and Sri Lankan agents,? he said.
A report published in local Arabic press said Sri Lankan recruitment offices have raised recruitment costs of domestic workers from $1,560 to $3,000, representing a 92 percent hike.
The report added that Sri Lankan agents have been delaying or suspending travel permits of workers waiting to be deployed in the Kingdom ?to put pressure on Saudi recruitment offices to pay the hefty amount for hiring domestic aides.?
Thassim said: ?The Kingdom and Sri Lanka will be holding talks soon to address the grievances of the parties concerned, and will hammer out a solution to the problem.?
The Saudi Embassy in Sri Lanka earlier issued an instruction for Saudi recruitment agents to pay $1,560 to hire a Sri Lankan housemaid, he added.
In the run-up to the holy month of Ramadan and Eid festivities, Saudi Arabia requires more household workers.
Both governments are keen to talk and solve the issue, but ?private business transactions between Saudi and Sri Lankan recruitment agencies cannot be stopped by the government until Riyadh and Colombo reach a settlement,? the envoy said.
The report quoted Hussain Al-Mutairi, head of the recruitment committee at the Eastern Province Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as saying: ?Sri Lankan recruitment offices have played with recruitment costs, which were at $1,560 as stipulated by an agreement signed between the Saudi and Sri Lankan offices.?
He added that the Sri Lankan offices ?have also hiked other related charges including the monthly salary, which was raised and fixed at SR1,300 ($346) by Sri Lankan agents last February compared to SR1,100 as previously agreed.?
Al-Mutairi accused Sri Lankan recruitment offices of exerting enormous pressure on their Saudi counterparts.
He called on Saudi offices ?not to respond to these pressures ... A unified position from the Saudi side will make the Sri Lankan offices work in line with the unified price agreed upon by both parties.?
Saudi Arabia is home to about 200,000 Sri Lankan workers, about 50 percent of them domestic helpers, mostly housemaids. (Arab News)

S. Korea charges ousted leader Park and Lotte chief with bribery
	
REUTERS, 17th APRIL, 2017- South Korean prosecutors on Monday charged ousted president Park Geun-hye and Lotte Group chairman Shin Dong-bin with bribery in the latest twist to a corruption scandal that rocked the country for months.
Prosecutors charged Shin without detaining him.
The retail giant Lotte, with interests ranging from hotels and retail to food and chemicals, becomes the second conglomerate mired in the political scandal after Jay Y. Lee, the chief of the biggest, Samsung Group, was arrested suspected of bribing Park and her friend, Choi Soon-sil.
Lee, Park and Choi are being held at detention centers.
Lotte, South Korea?s fifth-biggest conglomerate, is grappling with the Chinese shutdown of dozens of its stores in China, after it agreed to provide land for the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system?outside Seoul.
South Korea, which accuses China or discriminating against some South Korean companies working in China, and the United States say the sole purpose of THAAD is to guard against North Korean missiles. China says its powerful radar can penetrate its territory and undermine its security and spoke out against it again on Monday.
Lotte?s chief Shin is also on a separate graft trial involving family members charged with embezzlement and breach of trust.

Scotland Yard arrests Indian business tycoon Vijay Mallya
	
Indian business tycoon Vijay Mallya who was accused of defaulting on loans worth Indian crores has been arrested in London and will be produced in a metropolitan court today, NDTV said.
India had in February asked the UK to extradite Mr Mallya, who is facing charges of money laundering and several warrants in the country.
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) sources count the arrest, which took place around 9.30 in the morning, as a big win in attempts to bring the liquor baron to justice.
Last month, the UK told India that its request had been certified by the Secretary of State.
A Delhi court last week put out an open-ended non-bailable warrant against the 61-year-old in a case of alleged violation of foreign exchange rules.
Mr Mallya left India a year ago amid attempts by a group of banks to recover around Rs. 9,000 crores in loans to his collapsed Kingfisher Airlines.
New Delhi had cancelled Mr Mallya's passport and asked the UK government to deport him to India. But initially, British officials said even without an Indian passport, he could legally stay on in London as he had a UK visa.
Mr Mallya has been charged with cheating and conspiracy by the CBI that filed a 1,000-page chargesheet against him for defaulting on a 900-crore loan taken from the IDBI bank in 2009.
The CBI probe found that 250 crore of this - given to buy aircraft parts - was diverted abroad.
Amid multiple attempts to extradite him, Mr Mallya was seen at events in the UK linked to his formula one team Sahara Force India.
In a series of tweets recently, he accused the government of holding him guilty "without a trial".

44th Death Anniversary of Dudley Senanayake Leadership beyond measure
	
Dudley was engaged in politics until his death at the age of 61.
	After leading a spiritual life sans politics for four years, Dudley was ?actively involved in spreading Buddhism in Germany, during which time he ?witnessed the fall of his party at the 1956 general elections.
	The most valuable aspect of Dudley Senanayake?s leadership is the ?agreement he entered into with the moderate Tamil leadership in 1965?it ?addressed several key concessions for the minorities which included ?language, devolution and?land matters.
Closest to a Lasting Solution ?
On August 12, 1953, violent demonstrations in four provinces compelled a reluctant Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake to sign ?shoot at sight with impunity??a painful decision for the susceptible man of 42 years. A few months later he tendered his resignation and bid goodbye to politics. Dudley, back politics was in search of a lasting solution to the Language, Ethnic and Minority issues. The ?Senanayake??Chelvanayakam Pact? was signed between Dudley Senanayake, the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka and S.J.V Chelvanayakam, leader of the Federal Party on March 24, 1965. Political analysts believe this unique agreement was a major progressive step towards a unitary and stable Sri Lanka.
Integrity
?Dudley was engaged in politics until his death at the age of 61. He was once invited by the British government to participate at the Coronation of the Queen in 1954, representing his country as its head of state. The organizers ran short of a horse-carriage for a Head of State and wanted our young PM from ?LIPTON?s Tea Estate? to share the carriage with an African head of state from a little-known British colony. Dudley emphatically declined the offer and even threatened to take the next flight home. The London Home office authorities replied, ?It is an insult to her Majesty if you do that? our man retorted, ?Officer, your suggestion is an insult to my great nation.? British authorities apologized, expressing their deepest regret before arranging a special carriage for our PM?a lesson for the new generation of politicians; but will they ever learn? ?
Buddhism to Germany?
After leading a spiritual life sans politics for four years, Dudley was actively involved in spreading Buddhism in Germany, during which time he witnessed the fall of his party at the 1956 general elections. However, at the request of party loyalists and family pressure, he was made to change his future plans and resume politics in 1957. The assassination of Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike in 1959 and the chaotic political happenings within government ranks led to the parliament being dissolved and an election being scheduled for March 1960. Dudley was invited to form a government in a hung parliament. His unstable minority government lasted only a month. Later, in 1965 following an electoral success at general elections, he became PM for the fourth time in a coalition led by the UNP. This is an extract from his victory speech on that occasion. ?
??I am glad that circumstances have enabled me to form a National Government, which might have been denied to me if I had obtained more seats. I am glad that I have been given the opportunity, I believe for the first time in this country, of making a sincere and genuine effort to solve the divisions among us racially. Let us cast all isms aside. I say that I and my Government, whatever the ism, will seek the greatest good of the greatest number.? ?
?Senanayake??Chelvanayakam Pact?of 1965?
?The text of the Pact?. ??
?Mr. Dudley Senanayake and Mr. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam met on March 24, 1965 and discussed matters relating to some problems over which the Tamil-speaking people were concerned, and Mr. Senanayake agreed that action on the following lines would be taken by him to ensure a stable government:?
(1) Action will be taken early under the Tamil Language Special Provisions Act to make provision of the Tamil Language of Administration and of Record in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.?
Mr. Senanayake explained that it was the policy of his party that a Tamil-speaking person should be entitled to transact business in Tamil throughout the island.
(2) Mr. Senanayake stated that it was the policy of his party to amend the Languages of Courts Act to provide for legal proceedings in the Northern and Eastern Provinces to be conducted and recorded in Tamil.
(3) Action will be taken to establish District Councils in Ceylon vested with powers over subjects to be mutually agreed upon between two leaders. It was agreed, however, that the government should have power under the law to give directions to such councils under the national interest.
(4) The Land Development Ordinance will be amended to provide that citizens of Ceylon be entitled to the allotment of land under the Ordinance.
Mr. Senanayake further agreed that in the granting of land under colonization schemes, the following priorities be observed in the Northern and Eastern provinces:
(a) Land in the Northern and Eastern provinces should in the first instance be granted to landless persons in the district.
(b) Secondly, to Tamil-speaking persons resident in the northern and?
eastern provinces.
(c) Thirdly, to other citizens in Ceylon, preference being given to Tamil citizens in the rest of the island.?
The most valuable aspect of Dudley Senanayake?s leadership is the above agreement he entered into with the moderate Tamil leadership in 1965?it addressed several key concessions for the minorities which included language, devolution and land matters. It was a settlement that could have re-enfranchised the Tamil-speaking citizens. Dudley?s failure to rally sufficient support for it within the majority community in the South had catastrophic consequences for the nation. Had it been put into action, it is quite likely that Sri Lanka would have been a lively, well-off, peaceful nation. This pact illustrated Dudley?s vision and insight to understand what was desirable to arrive at an accommodation with the minorities. ?
Dudley, the Tiny Tot
The British Colonial authorities were waiting for an opportunity to apprehend the leaders of the temperance movement when racial riots broke out in 1915, and during the height of Sinhala-Muslim clashes, the government issued arrest warrants under the pretext of controlling racial riots. One morning, Punjabi soldiers arrived at ?Woodlands? Borella, the residence of D.S. Senanayake: it coincided with the four-year old Dudley?s skirmish with his ayah over breakfast. The Punjabis attempted to arrest DS, the 30-year-old father of Dudley, when the maid rightfully protested against the illegal arrest of her master. One military officer unmercifully shoved her away. The son, too small to realize the gravity of the situation, was excited that his b?te noire of the moment, the ayah, was ?punished??as he reminisced about the event in later years.
??Shoot at sight? at Hartal ?53: Painful decision Triggered his resignation
?In July 1953, a mass workers? rally was organized by the Marxists who controlled 80 to 90 percent of trade unions to protest against moves by Dudley?s government to prune the rice subsidy, a legacy of World War II, which the people considered their birthright. Young Marxist firebrands made inciting speeches at a rally held in the city to protest the move. The crowds went on a rampage, which compelled police to baton charge and tear gas them. The leaders of two leftist parties, the LSSP and CP, saw an opportunity as tension grew among masses; they called for a Hartal on August 12. ??
Martial law and curfew was imposed; orders were issued to shoot at sight. The rioting men and women stood obstinately; the Police opened fire causing nine deaths. Dudley Senanayake was singled out by the opposition and had to face most of criticism, he even collapsed in the chamber once under stress. Subsequently he was flown to London for treatment, yet failing to recover from shock on his return, the great man who was elected by the people taught another lesson to all politicians by resigning from the post of Prime Minister, the leadership of the United National Party and politics altogether. ?
A bachelor captained fathers XI against sons at St Thomas? in 1963
Kirthie Abeyesekera writing to Sunday Observer on April 22, 1973 p-4, says, ?On April 1963, the man who left no offspring and heir to carry the Senanayake name played for a ?Fathers? Cricket XI. Dudley, then Leader of the Opposition, took part in a ?by St Thomas? Preparatory, Bandarawela, when the ?sons? played against the ?fathers?. ?I do not know by what stretch of imagination they have included me in this team?, Dudley the bachelor chuckled. Perhaps for the man who captained St Thomas? in his early thirties, temptation to play the game was too strong to resist, so he accepted the invitation and played. Abeyesekera added, ?Dudley declined the captaincy in that match because, ?I really have no right to play at all?, played a grand innings, top scoring with 47 and in a hectic bowling spell he took 4 wickets for 23 runs.?
In the political game as well, the ?reluctant captain? was a brilliant all-rounder who honoured rules to the letter and spirit. ??
White, the Auspicious Colour
Dudley was admitted to a private hospital on April 6, with a heart condition. On the 12th his condition worsened. Dudley, the statesman, who took oaths as Prime Minister four times closed his eyes for the last time just a few hours before the dawn of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year on the April 13, 1973. Astrologers recommended white as the auspicious colour of dress for the festival months ahead.

Tracing history Oil anointing ceremony at Natha Devale
	
The finale of the New Year celebrations, the ?Hisa Tel Game? or oil anointing ceremony, took place on Saturday. The Mahanayake of Asgiri, Venerable Panditha Warakagoda Gnanaratne Thera anointed oil on President Mathiripala Sirisena at the auspicious hour of 11.04 am. This ceremony took place at the historic Natha Devale, the abode of Maithree Buddha or God Natha.?
In fact there is no record indicating that anointing oil on New Year?s Day was conducted elsewhere in the country. The abode of God Natha seems to be where this event first occurred. The first Baronet of Kandy, Sir John D?Oyly speaks of this event in 1815, the year the British ceded the country to the Crown of Britain. In fact he writes about a ?Beht Vatura ? being prepared at Natha Devale, which he witnessed. This was for the preparation of oil anointing during the New Year. He further talks of the distribution of this oil to the two Devales before the event at the Natha Devale (the abode of God Natha). This was the first Devale to be built with the founding of Senkadagalapura. ?
God Natha has no form or shape but his goal was to help people and avoid conflict as he was to become the next Buddha or Maithree Buddha, sometimes called Avalokesva Buddha in the Mahayana cult of Buddhism. ?
God Natha does not belong to any provincial cult of Gods or to any Hindu clan. His arrival is a mystery but his first place of abode is attributed to Dorawaka in the Warakapola District in the Sabargamuwa Province. While he was residing in the area, God Pitiye told God Natha that he too wanted to reside in the same place. God Natha refused and with this, God Pitiye found that the only way to send him off was to kill cattle and eat their meat. He saw to it that the bones of these animals were thrown at God Natha to drive him away from the area. God Natha, whose vision and mission was to become Maithree Buddha, developed a strategy of moving away from the area that offended him. ?
So God Natha moved to the Central Hills and to Vehgiriya at Embekke. God Pitiye followed God Natha and wanted him to accommodate him at Vehgiriya. God Natha refused and acted in the same manner as at Dorawaka. He left the area and went to Dodamwela, located in the present-day Yatinuwara electorate. Here too, God Pitiye began to develop the same attitude towards God Natha. God Pitiye who is famous for bringing disaster rather than favour, used this system to drive God Natha out of any area he resided in. ?
God Natha complained to the mighty God Sakra and he is believed to have advised God Pitiye to leave God Natha alone and find a suitable place as his abode. But that did not deter him and God Pitiye continued to enjoy carrying out his tactics to drive God Natha from place-to- place as a beggar. ?
God Natha, though not afraid of the attitude of God Pitiye, wanted to pursue his mission. He then moved to Gonawatte in Haragama. This is an area full of deer. God Pitiye arrived and demanded that he move out of Gonawatte. But God Natha refused. Thereupon, he adopted the same methods as at Dorawaka, instead of cattle he killed deer, ate their flesh and threw the bones at God Natha. ?
Being a God with pure qualities, God Natha moved away to find another area at Pasgama, in the present Hewaheta Electorate. While on this route near the present Kande Junction, the intersection between Hanguranketha and Talatuoya, he came upon an old man clearing a land. He changed into the form of a human and asked about the closet way to Pasgama. The old man went with God Natha, thinking he was a human. At Pasgama, God Natha took his own form, that of no shape or form, and called upon the old man to inform all and sundry to come to the village that God Natha had come to reside in. Further, he took the stick that was in the hand of the old man and stuck it on the ground, saying an abode should be constructed for him. This information was passed onto King Bhuvanekabahu IV and he directed that a Devale be constructed on the spot where God Natha had planted the stick. ?
God Natha, through his powers, knew that his task had to be accomplished at Senkadagalapura and set up an abode on Dharmaraja Hill. From here he set out on foot to the present Natha Devale premises. He established himself on this sacred ground, the very place where the oil anointing ceremony was held on Saturday, April 15, graced by President Maithreepala Sirisena ??
Natha Devale also hosted a specific ritual in the naming of a new ?King? when elected. There was no crowning in the Kandyan Kingdom. The new King was named at the Natha Devale and he bellowed his name, looking towards the Sri Dalada Maligawa while standing on a stone (which is now used as a flower stand). According to Late Professor Warakewe Dhammaloka Thera who lived at Natha Devale Temple, the Cheitiya close to the Sri Dalada Maligawa is built over the ?Begging Bowl? of the Buddha. ?
It is a know fact that the Begging Bowl was always with the Sacred Tooth Relic. Professor Warakewe Dhammaloka Thera time and again opined that the begging bowl of the Buddha should be in one of the two Cheitiyas on the grounds of the Natha Devale.

US VP Pence warns N. Korea  ?all options are on the table? in DMZ visit
	
US Vice President Mike Pence used a visit to the heavily militarised border between the two Koreas on Monday to declare ?all options are on the table? in dealing with Pyongyang, the day after the North?s latest failed missile test. ??
Pence?s trip to the flashpoint frontier underscored Washington?s shifting policy towards the isolated state after years of nuclear and missile tests carried out in defiance of the international community. ??
The visit comes after a huge military parade during which North Korea showcased apparent intercontinental ballistic missiles, and as a US carrier group converges on the Korean peninsula, ratcheting up tensions to their highest point in years. ??
Washington wants to achieve security ?through peaceable means, through negotiations. But all options are on the table as we continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of South Korea,? Pence said at the village of Panmunjom inside the Demilitarised Zone. ?Pence, speaking at Freedom House, a few metres from the military demarcation line that he described as a ?frontier of freedom?, said America?s relationship with South Korea was ?ironclad and immutable?. ??

Did the US cyber-hack North Korea?s missile??
(Daily Mail, London), 16.04.2017 - ?North Korea attempted to fire a medium range missile that it introduced at a massive military parade, however, the weapon blew up roughly five seconds after being launched from a site near the port city of Sinpo. ??
Former British conservative Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the BBC on Sunday: ?It could have failed because the system is not competent enough to make it work, but there is a very strong belief that the US -through cyber methods- has been successful in interrupting these sorts of tests and making them fail.? ? Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland appeared on Fox News Sunday and declined to say whether the U.S. cyber-sabotaged North Korea?s failed missile launch. ??
