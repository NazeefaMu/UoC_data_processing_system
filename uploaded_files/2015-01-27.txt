	The CID has launched an inquiry into the controversial diplomatic passport alleged to have been obtained by former minister Wimal Weerawansa?s wife Shashi Weerawansa by producing false information.
	Police Spokesman Ajith Rohana said the investigation was based on a complaint lodged about passport.
	Sources told Daily Mirror that the former minister?s wife had applied for a diplomatic passport in 2010 by submitting false personal information which was different to what appears in her previous normal passport that expired on May 24, 2009.
	Sheerja Udayanthi Weerawansa was issued a normal passport bearing No: N1284124 on May 24, 2004 giveing the date of birth as February 1, 1967 and the National Identity Card number as 675320233V. The application number was N041308865.
	She had given her address as, A/9 MP?s Quarters, Madiwela, her place of birth was stated as Wellampitiya and profession as housewife.
	But her new diplomatic passport D3642817 is dated September 13, 2010 and it will expire on September 13, 2020 The diplomatic passport gives her name as Randunu Mudiyanselage Shehasha Udayanthi Ranasinghe with her date of birth as February 3, 1971 and the NIC number, 715344696V.? Her address was mentioned as B/13, Pajat Road, Stanmore Crescent, Colombo 7 and the application number, N101727278. Her profession was given as housewife and marital status appears on both passports as married with the eye colour, hair colour and complexion stated as black.
	When contacted, Immigration and Emigration Controller M.N. Ranasinghe said this case may come under the fraudulent document category because the personal details on both travel documents did not match although the photograph is of the same person. (Kevin Kariyawasam)

Vehicle was only lent to me - Jackson Anthony
	
	Popular artiste Jackson Anthony today denied allegations that a luxury vehicle without number plates belonging to a government ministry was recovered from his home.
	He said at a media briefing that the vehicle found parked by his residence was not gifted to him but only given to him on a temporary basis to be used for his Travel TV show productions in order to promote the company?s vehicles.
	?I had asked for a vehicle from the Micro Cars (Pvt) Ltd to make it easy for me to travel for the TV show productions. The company acceded to my request and gave me two brand new vehicles for each of the programmes. Otherwise, I would have had to hire a vehicle and that would have cost me a huge amount,? he said.
	Mr. Anthony said several print media publications had reported that he had received three luxury vehicles from a certain government ministry.
	?I have no connection with any ministry,? he said.
	?However, two Police officers from the Kadawatha police station had come to my house and conducted an inquiry based on information given to the 119 police unit and obtained a statement from my wife.
	?I told the Kadawatha police that the vehicle belonged to the Micro Car Company,? Mr. Anthony said; adding that the Police had also checked this with the Micro Car Company which confirmed what he had said and that the details could be obtained from the Kadwatha Police.
	Police Spokesman Ajith Rohana said police had found that the vehicle belonged to the Micro Car Company and not to any government ministry. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Video: Bus fares to be reduced by 8 ? 10%
	
	The fares on private and SLTB buses will be reduced from February 1 with Rs.8 as the minimum fare sequent to the fuel price reduction introduced by the Power and Energy Ministry. ?
	Internal Transport Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara told the media today that bus-fare reduction of 10% to 11% would be based on three segments ranging from the minimum fare of Rs.8 to the highest fare of Rs.651 for normal bus transport.
	The price difference for the first section will be Rs.1 with the highest being between Rs.41 and Rs.57. The National Transport Commission (NTC) will ensure that luxury and semi-luxury bus operators will follow suit accordingly and reduce their bus fares as well from February 1.
	The minister said Sri Lanka?s train fares were among the lowest in the region and it was difficult to reduce train fares further because it would seriously affect the financial situation of the railways.
	A discussion was scheduled last afternoon with owners of school buses and vans and three-wheeler owners with the intention of reducing their fares as well.
	?However, a permanent monitoring system will have to be worked out to monitor school and trishaw transport,? the minister said and added that efforts would be made to put this mechanism in place within the 100-day programme.
	?It is not a difficult task to monitor, manage and regularize the transport services because all internal transport ? railway, private and SLTB bus transport have brought under one roof,? he said.
	Responding to a journalist who said the reduction of bus fares was not proportionate to the sharp drop in fuel prices, the minister said the NTC had to consider other costs of bus operators such as the cost of spare parts, loan interests and staff costs, etc.
	He admitted to the need of improving bus and the railway services because these services have dropped sharply in recent times.
	The SLTB will take steps to improve its night bus services and school bus service with the assistance of the funds provided by the Treasury.
	The minister said the bus fares would be revised based on the fluctuations in the global fuel prices.
	Internal Transport Ministry Secretary Dr. Lalithasiri Gunaruwan said transport fares cannot be revised each and every time fuel prices fluctuates in the global market other that through the accepted mechanism in place to work out bus fare revisions.(Sandun Jayasekara)

Stray dogs kill 13 chevrotains in the Zoo
	
	13 mouse deer (Chevrotains), considered endemic species, died on Monday night due to an attack by a pack of stray dogs that entered through a hole on the Dehiwala zoo parapet wall, according to the employees.
	The veterinary surgeons who performed the autopsy on the dead animals said that the chevrotains succumbed to the injuries caused by savagery. These animals are said to be very sensitive and innocent.
	Due to construction works being carried out in the Zoological garden, the dogs strayed into the garden to eat the animal feed, pose a threat to the animals? lives as well as to their health, the employees said.
	The chevrotains are kept adjacent to the area where the elephant show takes place which is insecure and security officers do not pay much attention to this shortcoming. As a result, death of animals has increased, said the officers-in-charge of the area.
	In spite of the fact that the journalists had made attempts to contact the Deputy Directress of the Zoological Gardens, Dhammika Malsinghe and the Director, Anura de Silva, their attempts were proved futile. (Suranjan Perera and Indika Manoj Cooray)

India to take bilateral ties with SL to new level: Envoy
	
India will work closely with the new Sri Lankan government led by Maithripala Sirisena - whose victory was a tribute to Lankan people's yearning for change - to take bilateral ties to a new level, the Indian High Commissioner Y K Sinha said today.
Addressing the celebrations of the 66th Indian Republic Day held at India House in Colombo, Sinha said India stands ready to continue to provide support and partnership to Sri Lanka in realising its people's aspirations.
He congratulated the people of Sri Lanka on the peaceful conduct of the recent landmark elections that installed a new government under Sirisena in the island after defeating two-time president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Sinha noted that electoral victory of Sirisena, was "a tribute to his capacity to respond to Sri Lankan people's yearning for change".
"The prosperity and security of the two countries is indivisible. India looks forward to working with the new Government of Sri Lanka to take the bilateral relationship to the next level for the benefit of the people of the two countries and the South Asian region as a whole," he added.
Speaking about the bilateral ties, Sinha said that India and Sri Lanka enjoy a vibrant and growing economic and commercial partnership, with both trade and investment expanding sharply in recent years.
Bilateral trade witnessed an upswing in 2014 and in the period January-November 2014, amounted to nearly USD 4 billion.
Premier Indian companies have displayed great interest in Sri Lanka. The 'Make in India' initiative will attract more Sri Lankan companies to invest in India, he said.
Sinha stated that one important pillar of modern India- Sri Lanka relations is development cooperation, which has been built on the foundation of mutual trust and understanding.
The flagship Indian Housing Project in Sri Lanka continues to make excellent progress, with the project reaching its target of constructing 16,000 houses during 2014. A total of 27,000 houses have been constructed under this project till date, he said.
The reconstruction of the railway line up to Jaffna, carried out under a concessional Indian Line of Credit of about USD 800 million, was a seminal moment, Sinha said.
With the inauguration of the reconstructed railway track, reconnecting Jaffna to Colombo by rail after more than 24 years was achieved with Indian assistance. (The Economic Times)

<U+200B>MR says media blitz to vilify him
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a statement today charged that a media blitz had been unleashed to vilify him and mislead the public instead of following a proper procedure to act on allegeations of wrongdoing against anybody.Full statement
To the Venerable Maha Sangha, all Reverend Clergymen and the People of Sri Lanka,
Numerous allegations have been levelled against me, my family and my government both before and after the recent presidential election. If there are allegations of wrongdoing against anybody, there are established procedures that can be followed. What we see instead is a media blitz meant to vilify me and to mislead the public. I wish to state my position on these matters so that the people will not be misled by this unprecedented campaign of vilification by interested parties.
The allegation has been made that I attempted to launch a military coup in the early hours of the 9th January. On the contrary, I conceded defeat and having discussed matters with the then opposition leader Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe, left Temple Trees several hours before the final results were announced.
The accusation that I sought the Attorney General?s advice on how to remain in power illegally is by its very nature, an absurdity. I was saddened by the comments made about this alleged incident and other matters by the incumbent president at a rally in Polonnaruwa. It is with deep regret that I state that I am not being allowed to spend my days in peace even after leaving office.
Images of the interior of Temple Trees have been disseminated with the insinuation that I and my family had led an extravagant lifestyle at state expense. Attention was focused on an air conditioned rest room with TV and attached baththroom. This particular section of the Temple Trees premises was fully refurbished for the 2013 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in accordance with international specifications. An exhibition and a banquet for the visiting heads of state were held there. Over the past decade all foreign dignitaries visiting Sri Lanka have been received at Temple Trees and the quality of the facilities available had to suit the purpose.
Raids have been conducted by self appointed anti-corruption campaigners and the police to uncover evidence of waste, corruption and misuse of state funds by my government. A stock of plastic wall clocks with my likeness, a stock of tea cups with the ?sataka? symbol, stickers, posters and calendars have been shown on TV with the insinuation that the very existence of such items points to wrongdoing. Yet the people know that the possession of items like that by various individuals cannot possibly constitute a crime or an abuse of power. There was even an accusation that my wife had been involved in a scam trying to sell 100 kilos of gold belonging to no less an institution than the Treasury. Since the police have already responded to that ridiculous allegation, I do not wish to say anything further on that matter other than to point out that gold belonging to the treasury cannot be sold in that manner even by the Secretary to the Treasury leave alone the first lady!
Vehicles that even remotely resemble sports cars are being taken by the police from the houses of their owners in their search for Lamborghinis belonging to my sons. But no Lamborghinis were found. My property in Weeraketiya was raided in search of a seaplane. Two containers of personal belongings of my family have been examined by the police on suspicion of being items ?stolen? from Temple Trees. These items were stored in containers because I had no place to go to in Colombo after vacating my official residence. They will remain in the containers until I receive the official residence due to a former president.
My government carried out more development work in this country than any other government in post independence history. These unprecedented achievements were belittled in the eyes of the public during the presidential election campaign with the malicious propaganda that the costs of these infrastructure projects had been overpriced three to tenfold and huge kickbacks taken by politicians and officials in my government. The estimates for all infrastructure projects are made by Technical Evaluation Committees (TECs) made up of well qualified and reputed engineers.
The project is then evaluated by a cabinet appointed tender board which is made up of the most senior civil servants in the country. Every agreement signed with a foreign lending agency is vetted by the Attorney General and it has to receive final approval from the cabinet. Sri Lanka is now a middle income country and not entitled to development assistance. Therefore, my government used concessionary financing arrangements with the ADB, World Bank, and the Japanese, Chinese and Indian governments for the implementation of certain development projects. If the cost of a project is to be artificially inflated as some have alleged, there will have to be collusion between all the relevant bodies of the government, the international project consultants who design and supervise the project from start to finish, the contractor and the lending agency - a process involving scores of individuals and therefore virtually impossible.
Some say that the main contractor in some projects subcontracts some of the work to others at a lower cost and therefore the entire project can be done at that lower price. The usual practice in the construction industry is that sub-contractors are brought in for certain tasks while the main contractors do the more important tasks themselves. However, the responsibility for the entire project rests with the main contractor.
At times segments of the same project are financed by different lenders. Two segments of the Southern Highway were financed by Japan and one segment by China. Similarly, two segments of the Outer Circular Highway were financed by Japan and one segment by China. It is the Chinese funded projects that have been singled out for criticism. China is a country that has helped all Sri Lankan governments for over six decades. Like all international lending organisations the China Exim Bank also has procedures in place to ensure the integrity of their transactions. I wish to suggest to those concerned that this maligning of a friendly country that has helped us so generously over many decades should stop.
Outrageous and totally unsubstantiated accusations against me were disseminated through various websites and social media networks such as facebook both before and after the election. I self-critically admit that my government did not take these baseless allegations seriously and counter them in time.
However, I am confident that the truth will prevail one day.
May the blessings of the triple gem be upon you
Mahinda Rajapaksa
Former President of Sri Lanka

	Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) leader, the Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera alleged today that there was a plot to murder the drug kingpin Samantha Kumara (alias ?Wele Suda?) in an attempt to prevent him from giving evidence against persons in high places who were involved in drug trafficking.
	He said he was in possession of reports of such a plan to silence Wele Suda who was taken into custody by the Criminal Investigation Division (CID). ?
	In a letter to Police Chief N. K. Illangakoon, the Thera has requested him to provide adequate security to Wele Suda.
	?Reports in my possession say that a plot has been hatched to kill him to prevent him giving vital evidence.? If he is killed because he has exposed details of politicians and senior police officers involved in drug trafficking, the only source to additional information would be cut off,? he said in his letter.
	The Thera requested the Police Chief to pay attention to the matter.
	?Wele Suda, who was arrested in Pakistan, was brought to Sri Lanka two weeks ago.
	Wele Suda had revealed that four persons including a Colombo District MP, two sub inspectors and a former IGP were involved with him in drug trafficking. (Lahiru Pothmulla)Pix by Kushan Pathiraja

	He said Wele Suda is reported to have gone under two other names and as such the police would also check whether accounts were maintained under these two names as well.
	The SSP said the Central Bank?s Financial Investigation Unit would assist the police in investigating the suspects? foreign accounts especially those in Pakistan and Dubai.
	He said since 2012 Wela Suda was believed to have smuggled into the country about a 1,000 kilos of heroin worth some eight to 10 million rupees a kilo.
	?The fate which had befallen this massive amount of money obtained from drug trafficking was uncertain. Wele Suda revealed that he paid money to Mr. Silva so as to continue his smuggling unhampered. He also alleged that Lalitha Kaushaluya, who was killed in Athurugiriya had paid money to the MP. The police found an Allion Toyota Car near a house at Madiwela bought by Wele Suda from drug trafficking,? SSP Rohana said. ?
	He said investigations will be launched against Wele Suda on charges of money laundering and terrorist connections. (Sanath Desmond)Video by Sanath DesmondPix by Pradeep Pathirana

Steps will be taken to arrest former minister Wimal Weerawansa?s wife, if Immigration and Emigration Controller confirmed that she had violated the Emigration and Immigration laws by holding two passports giving contrary information, Police said.
?We have requested the Immigration and Emigration Controller to inform us whether she had violated the Emigration and Immigration laws, if she had done so we will arrest her,? Police Spokesman Ajith Rohana.
SSP Rohana said initial investigations had revealed that she had obtained two passports including a diplomatic passport under two different names and birth dates.
?A person in Battaramulla had complained to the police that Mr. Weerawansa?s wife had two passports and investigations had revealed that she had obtained one of them under the name of Ranasinghe Randunu Mudiyanselage Sirja Udayanthi and the other under the name of Ranasinghe Randunu Mudiyanselage Fesna Udayanthi by producing two birth certificates. One of which had the date of birth as February 1, 1967 and the other as February 3, 1971,? SSP Rohana said.
He said it was illegal to possess two passports according to Clause 45.1 of the Immigration and Emigration Act, and in case someone wished to apply for a new passport, the previous one had to be cancelled.
SSP Rohana said when someone with a normal passport applied for a diplomatic passport; its number should be mentioned in the diplomatic passport. He said according to investigations, Ms. Weerawansa had not done so.
When asked it was possible for a minister?s wife could obtain a diplomatic passport, SSP Rohana said it was questionable and that they had asked the Immigration and Emigration Controller regarding the matter. (Sanath Desmond and Ajith Siriwardana)Video by Sanath Desmond
