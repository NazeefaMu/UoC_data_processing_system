ComBank launches low cost insurance for micro borrowers
	
A low cost insurance scheme that will protect micro borrowers has been launched by Commercial Bank of Ceylon in association with two insurance companies, Ceylinco Insurance and BIMA.
The policy will cover the borrowers against accidental death or permanent disability, compensate for loss of income due to hospitalisation and also contribute towards funeral expenses.
Monthly premiums of Rs 150, Rs 300 and Rs 600 respectively for the Silver, Gold and Platinum categories of the scheme provide accident cover of Rs 1 million, Rs 2 million and Rs 4 million, with life cover of Rs 50,000, Rs 100,000 and Rs 150,000, the Bank said.
?This scheme is yet another example of our commitment to the wellbeing and protection of our customers in the micro enterprise segment,? Commercial Bank?s Deputy General Manager (Personal Banking) Chandana Gunasekera said. ?Today?s micro borrowers can be small or medium enterprises in just a few years with the right support, and Commercial Bank is committed to provide that support.?
The issuing of insurance cover will be done by Ceylinco Insurance PLC and Melvik Lanka (branded as BIMA), a mobile insurance provider that will handle the sales, technical implementation and claims administration. Depending on the demand for the product, the Bank said it may locate representatives of BIMA at branches where the potential is high.
Policyholders will be entitled to daily payments ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000 for every day spent at a hospital up to a maximum of 20 days to cover their loss of income due to an illness or accident under this scheme.
In the event of accidental death of a policyholder, payments of Rs 25,000 to Rs 100,000 will be made towards funeral expenses, and the insurance proceeds may be utilized to settle the outstanding loan.
Commercial Bank already has a large micro saver/borrower client base served by its existing Bancassurance facility. The new scheme is an extension of these services, the Bank said.
Commercial Bank operates a network of 243 branches and 613 ATMs in Sri Lanka and is the country?s largest private bank.?

Dhamma Sangayana in 2017: Ranil
	
The United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) yesterday pledged to hold a Dhamma Sangayana (Buddhist Religious Discourse) in Sri Lanka in 2017 if its elected to office, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Addressing the Sanga Samuluwa for Good Governance at the Ape Gama model village in Battaramulla, Mr. Wickremesinghe said the Mahanayakes of the main chapters should decide on having a Dhamma Sangayana and the government could facilitate it.
He said such s Dhamma Sangayana was needed to resolve certain issues regarding Buddhism in the country.
The Prime Minister said Sri Lanka would be made the centre of Theravada Buddhism to propagate and preserve Theravada Buddhism in the region and the globe as a whole. He said Sri Lanka would be able to play a role in preserving Theravada Buddhism in the way it was done by Emperor Asoka in the ancient past.
Further, he said the University of Pali and Buddhist Studies would be upgraded to similar status of Nalanda in India which is a Mahayana Buddhist University. However he said it would be a Theravada Buddhist University.
Referring to politics he said Buddhist principles would also be instilled into parliamentary practice.
Power and Energy Minister and UNFGG Colombo District Candidate Patali Champika Ranawaka said the overall objective of the UNFGG is to introduce a civilized political culture. The Minister told the Maha Sangha not to get deceived by false reports claiming that the UNFGG was going to implement federalism. He said the UNFGG strongly denounce federalism. ?We are not proxies of the LTTE,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

Janashakthi launches book to commemorate 20 years in insurance
	
Janashakthi Insurance recently launched the book ?Taming Risk ? The Janashakthi Story? by author Michelle Gunawardana at the Cinnamon Grand hotel.?
The book was commissioned by Janashakthi in 2014 to commemorate their 20-year history in insurance. The title is a reference to the insurance industry as a means of managing uncertainty and risk.
Speaking at the launch ceremony, C. T. A. Schaffter said, ?When we started over two decades ago, we were already late. There were 5 other players in the market which made for fierce competition but through innovation and strategic thinking we persevered and grew. Be it the generation of startup capital or going beyond our actual liability during the tsunami of 2004 or the regulatory challenges of 2009, we have had our mettle tested over the years and at each juncture we have come through it stronger. This book is a testament to all the mountains we?ve scaled and a reminder of the lessons we?ve learned through this journey.?
Through a series of comprehensive interviews spanning a broad arc of key stakeholders from the Schaffter family, the company?s first employees and board directors to regulators and clients and sifting through archival records, the author is able weave a vivid story, rich in historic fact and intimate details tracing the history of the company all the way back to its conception.Woven into this compelling narrative are snapshots of the industry and country that Janashakthi was born into and the personal contributions made by those that guided it along the way. In essence the book is a tribute to the spirit, entrepreneurship, innovation and extraordinary leadership that shaped Janashakthi over the decades.
This feat of captivating storytelling was only possible through the skilled hands of author Michelle Gunawardana. Her history in banking and compelling and informal narrative style, as witnessed in her previous works, made her the perfect author to be entrusted with Janashakthi?s story. The picture she paints is one of a company that, overcoming several hurdles, has reached a position of strength in the industry and is again on the cusp of change at an important time in the country?s history.
?The history of insurance, going back 4000 years, turned out to be a fascinating subject. And the concept of sharing risk, so that losses weigh lightly on many rather than heavily on a few (as Sir Francis Bacon once put it) is itself a wonderful thing, when you think about it. Chandra Schaffter understood the essence of insurance and when he founded Janashakthi, at the age of 65, when most others are thinking about retirement, he created an entity that embraced that spirit. The company?s journey has been a dramatic one, and it has triumphed over great difficulties to achieve great results, in the relatively short space of 20 years. The Janashakthi story is a story of extraordinary vision, entrepreneurship, leadership, courage and belief, and it has been my privilege to capture it,? said author, Michelle Gunawardana.

Video: Malaysia confirm debris is from missing MH370
	
	Part of the aircraft wing found on Reunion Island is from the missing MH370 plane, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has confirmed.
	Mr Najib said international experts examining the debris in France had "conclusively confirmed" it was from the aircraft.
	The Malaysia Airlines plane carrying 239 people veered off course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014.
	The debris was found on the remote French Indian Ocean island a week ago.
	The plane is believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean - though no evidence had been found despite a massive search operation.
	"It is with a very heavy heart that I must tell you that an international team of experts has conclusively confirmed that the aircraft debris [...] is indeed MH370," Mr Najib told reporters.
	"We now have physical evidence that [...] flight MH370 tragically ended in the southern Indian Ocean," he added.
	Mr Najib said he hoped the discovery "will at least bring certainty to the families" of the victims, saying the burden they had faced was "unspeakable".
	French prosecutor Serge Mackowiak later confirmed the wing fragment, known as a flaperon, was from a Boeing 777 - the same make and model as the missing Malaysian airliner.
	He said initial tests showed there were "very strong indications" that it was from flight MH370. But he said confirmation would only come after further tests on the fragment, which would begin on Thursday.
	"[Investigators] will try to do it as soon as possible in order to provide total and reliable information to the family of victims, who are on our minds at the moment," Mr Mackowiak added.
	The Paris prosecutor failed to be as categorical as the Malaysian prime minister in asserting that the wing piece does come from MH370. All he said was that there are very strong reasons to presume that it is from the missing plane.
	That does not mean that the prosecutor has any reason to doubt the prime minister's conclusion - simply that he is exercising supreme legal caution.
	In the coming days there will be more tests on the flaperon and it's expected that these will prove the piece's origin. After that, it will probably be many months before deeper analysis allows any tentative deductions about how the plane may have come down.
	The debris is being examined at an aeronautical test centre near Toulouse.
	There is little doubt now that the flaperon will be declared the first evidence of MH370 in the coming days as no other Boeing 777s are thought to have crashed in the region.
	Relatives of the victims were told about the initial results shortly before Mr Najib's news conference on Wednesday.
	Jacquita Gonzales, the wife of crew member Patrick Gomes, said: "Now that they have confirmed it as MH370, I know my husband is no longer of this world but they just can't leave it with this one flaperon."
	"We urge them to continue searching until they find the plane and bring it back," she told reporters. "It's not over yet."
	She said she still hoped to get her husband's body back so that the family can give him a proper burial and say goodbye.
	Malaysia Airlines described confirmation of the flaperon as "a major breakthrough".
	In a statement, it said it hoped further evidence would be found in the coming days that would "help resolve this mystery". (BBC)

MR would have still captained SLC: Arjuna
	
	Fortunately the Kurunegala District UPFA candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa had not played cricket. Had he played and won the limited over cricket World Cup in 1996, he would have still been the captain of the Sri Lanka team, Gampaha District UPFA candidate Arjuna Ranatunga said today.
	He made these remarks when he addressed a large gathering of supporters, when former President Chandrika Kumaratunga visited the main election propaganda office in Gampaha.
	?I was able to lead a fantastic cricket team wherein all members were a dedicated, extremely talented and patriotic lot. We also produced a second rung of players from up and coming young cricketers, who were ready to replace seniors when they retire.
	?But President Rajapaksa failed to build up a second ring of political leaders from among young and skilful politicians in the SLFP but concentrated on keeping power among himself and his family.
	?That is why I told you that if he won the World Cup in 1996, he would have never given up the captaincy of the team,? Minister Ranatunga charged.
	Minister Ranatunga said former President Kumaratunga worked hard to bring President Maithripala Sirisena and the Yahapalana Government to power as she loved the country.
	?She has worked hard to strengthen the concept of good governance, prevent corrupt politicians being elected to Parliament and to protect the January 8 Silent Revolution,? he said.
	?The August 17 election is a contest between the good and bad, evil and justice and law and lawlessness or a fight against the UNP and the UFPA that represent the good and the bad respectively.
	?The voters of this country deserve to be represented by decent, corrupt free and educated members in Parliament. They can find respectable and intelligent candidates only from among UNP candidates in each and every district. Therefore it is up to the voters to elect a member they can call their Manthrithuma with pride,? he stressed.
	Minister Ranatunga said Mrs. Kumaratunga was deeply disappointed and heartbroken over the fate of the SLFP today, which was established by her illustrious father, late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike.
	?She is determined to bring the SLFP to its former glory after August 17 poll and that is why she wants a government with clean and honourable politicians,? he said.
	Commenting on the plight of war heroes, Minister Ranatunga lamented that under the Rajapaksa regime, Ranawiruwo used to sing with grief but not with a feeling of victory and added the UNFGG government to be formed after August 17 would not let anyone to belittle war heroes.
	?It was sad to witness how the Rajapaksa regime deployed ex-war heroes on menial duties like to water flower beds excavate and clean drains forgetting that they were the warriors who saved the country from terrorism. Some politicians may not have resorted to corruptions and misdeeds if those war heroes did not do that. The corrupt politicians have exploited the prevailing peaceful situation to their advantage to rob the country,? Minister Ranatunga added.
	A large number of retired war heroes were present at the occasion. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

	?In a television programme telecast on July 2, Hirunika alleged that a police complaint had been lodged against me for not marrying a girl after making a promise to do so. However, she failed to even produce credible documents to prove the charge. She also alleged I was engaged in a scrap iron theft,? he said.
	He said Ms. Premachandra had further charged that the budget report he presented on the expenditures of the election campaign for previous provincial council, was a fabrication.

?However, there are reports that UNPers are campaigning to promote Sajith Premadasa as the Opposition Leader and if this happens, UNP Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will have to face hurdles,? he told a news conference at party headquarters.
Meanwhile, he said UNP Badulla District candidate Harin Fernando had failed to addresses the charges thrown at the UNP and had instead asked the UPFA to take poison.
Mr. Perera invited UNP leaders to take poison alleging they were involved in frauds and in return Mr. Fernando asked the UPFA members to consume poison when the party was defeated on August 18. ?
