Video: EC wants self-regulation for media
	
Election Commissioner Mahinda Desapriya said yesterday he would initiate discussions with private media institutions to evolve a self regulatory system to be followed during elections .
He told a news conference that some provisions for media control during elections were included in the original draft of the 19th Amendment, but the Supreme Court struck them off as needing a referendum. He said it would be better to have a system evolved by the media community to exercise self-control and that he intended having a dialogue with the stakeholders for for this purpose
"Ours is a society relying on information flowing from the media. Traditionally our people have come to believe what the media says," Mr. Deshapriya said and underscored the fact that he had encountered problems with the private and state media during the previous election.

I was not allowed to work freely: Vijith Vijayamuni
	
UPFA MP Vijith Wijayamuni Zoysa said yesterday that he was not allowed to work freely in the Wildlife Ministry as its subject minister, and that everything was done by former minister Basil Rajapaksa.
?I was not allowed to work in the wildlife ministry as I wanted. But I was blamed when a farmer or an elephant calf died. The main road in Bibile was not carpeted in order to spite me,? he said.
It was a pity that racketeers who carried out massive illegal land grabs got away scot free but poor farmers who committed minor offences were punished,? he said, at a meeting held at the Thanamalvila divisional secretariat recently. (Sujeewa Jayawickrama)

No dissolution till 20A enacted-Rathana Thera
	
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) chairman and Pivithuru Hetak convenor, the Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said yesterday that they would not allow parliament to be dissolved without the 20th Amendment to the Constitution first being enacted.
He said the Pivithuru Hetak organization together with other civil society organizations would launch a massive peoples? power movement, if the draft of the 20th Amendment was not presented at the Cabinet meeting held that evening or within the following two days.
?We do not see much interest in introducing the 20th Amendment -- just as in the case of the 19th Amendment. 95% of SLFPers have shown their interest in this; a few others are trying to disrupt it with ulterior motives. Some UNP MPs also assured me that they would support 20 A,? he said.
The Thera alleged that the UNP was dragging its feet regarding the introduction of the 20th Amendment and said this the government was not elected on the votes of UNP supporters alone.
?This was not the sole victory of the UNP. Civil society organizations also played a major role,? he said, at a meeting held at Ape Gama in Battaramulla calling for the enactment of the 20th Amendment and the scrapping of the preferential voting system.
Movement for a Just Society convenor, the Ven.Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera said the change of government at the last presidential election was a remarkable political change and that they would continue their struggle until the 20th Amendment was enacted.
The Ven. Sobitha Thera said enactment of 20 A was not just an issue concerning the UNP, SLFP or JVP but rather an issue of national importance.
?Governments in the past were toppled on promises of providing relief to the people; but on this occasion it was done to bring about political reforms,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Video: DG Customs was victim of misuse of power: JVP
	
The Director General of Customs was compelled to resign as a result of undue influence being brought to bear on him by a government minister who was engaged in the business of importing and exporting dried ericanuts , the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) charged today.
JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti told a media briefing that this minister had used the power given to him by his office to influence the former DG of Customs to help him to import dried ericanuts from Indonesia before reloading them onto different containers and importing them to India using the concessions granted to Sri Lanka by India.
He said the minister in question, who hails from the |North Western Province, had no particular political affiliation and was often seen hobnobbing with both government and opposition folds.
MP Handunnetti said this was not the only reasons for the resignation of the Customs Director General as there had been more political influence used to get 15 containers of glyphosate, a banned agro-chemical released from customs while undue influence had also been applied with regards to obtaining licenses for the importation of used vehicles.
Mr. Handunnetti said conflicts such as these between politicians and state officials had led to a lack of trust between both parties as well as caused several serious economic issues. He said when such activities are highlighted the business community loses interest in investing in new businesses and therefore the country suffers in the long run.(Yohan Perera and Sanath Desmond)

Electoral reforms: Cabinet fails to reach agreement
	
Despite last ditch attempts Cabinet, last night, failed once again to reach consensus on the proposed electoral reforms, informed sources said yesterday.
However, the leaders of the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA), at a separate meeting with President Maitripala Sirisena pledged their cooperation to enact the proposed new electoral system.
Cabinet took the matter up for discussion yesterday . It is learnt that Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) leader Rauff Hakeem, in particular, was opposed to the proposal to elect 160 MPs from single member constituencies, five from multi-member constituencies, 31 according to the Proportional Representation System and 59 from the National List.
There were heated arguments between him and Power and Energy Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka. Minister Palani Digambaram also joined in the verbal battle.
Finally, Cabinet gave the power to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to decide on the announcement of the new system in a gazette notification subject to agreement by the constituent parties of the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA).
The President presented a summary of the report on electoral reforms compiled by the Cabinet subcommittee. He said he would ask the UPFA leaders whether they wanted to move ahead with the no confidence motion or enact the electoral reforms as the 20th Amendment.
Accordingly, he met the UPFA leaders soon after the Cabinet meeting. It is learnt that the UPFA leaders were in favour of the criteria proposed by the President. (Kelum Bandara)

No need to change President or Prime Minister- Champika
	
Power and Energy Minister and Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) general secretary Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday that what was required today was not to change the president or prime minister but to change the electoral system.
He said the 20th Amendment to the Constitution should be enacted and that there was no reason for anyone to object as it was introduced with a sufficient time for discussion.
?Some political forces are trying to derail the process of enacting 20 A by citing various objections. We should not allow the political leaders to avoid it as it was not hastily brought in,? he said.
Mr. Ranawaka said at a meeting at the Ape Gama in Battaramulla that the main choice at the last presidential election was between political reforms and maintaining status quo and that the former had prevailed.
UPFA MP Dilan Perera said the SLFP was in favour of 20 A, and if the UNP supported it, it could be passed without difficulty.
Mr. Perera said the UNP was obstructing 20 A indirectly by citing various drawbacks, whereas the JVP was willing to approve it with minor changes.
?We have a good opportunity to get 20 A enacted by the present parliament. If we lose this opportunity the people's aspirations would be suppressed for ever,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
