300 families in Bamba flats to be relocated in 60 storey building
	
The National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) would relocate the three hundred families living in the Bambalapitiya flats in a sixty storey building, after the flats were demolished for the proposed mixed development project, NHDA Deputy General Manager Sarath Kumara said.
Mr. Kumara said the Bambalapitiya flats would be demolished in order to claim the 10.16-acre land for another housing and semi-commercial project by a Singapore-based Indian company.
However, discussions were still ongoing with the people in the flats, and a date to knock down the building was yet to be decided, he said.
Mr. Kumara pointed out that each family would receive Rs.50, 000 - Rs. 80,000 as rental for temporary places until the construction of the new sixty storey building was completed.
He said an acre from the entire land, valued at Rs.11.3 billion, would be reserved for the relocation project. According to him, the construction of the new building would be completed in two and half years. However, the date of commencement is yet to be decided.
Sources said the Cabinet approval for the redevelopment of Bambalapitiya flats was given on March 2, 2016.
?This building, located near the sea, has decayed and become unsafe. The proposal made by Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa to implement the redevelopment of the Bambalapitiya flats with foreign investors recommended by the Board of Investment was approved by the Cabinet,? the government information department said.
The mixed development project which would be constructed on 9.16 acres of the total land would consist of semi-commercial ventures developed by the Singapore-based Indian company, Mr. Kumara said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

ISIS bans burka
	
The ISIS has outlawed the burka at their security centres in a northern Iraqi city, despite previously brutally enforcing a law requiring them to be worn, Daily Mail reported today.
The terror group has banned women entering the buildings in Mosul while wearing the full-face covering after a number of commanders were killed by veiled women.
Previously women in Syria and Iraq have been beaten or even killed by ISIS's 'morality police' for not wearing a veil to conceal their body and eyes.
The website Iran Front Page were informed of the ban by a source in Nineveh, Iraq, on Friday.
The normal strict dress code implemented by ISIS forces all women to be covered from head to toe in black.
Women in the rest of Mosul except for the security centres, and in all other areas controlled by ISIS, will still have to abide by the strict dress code, it is understood.
Last month, women were pictured celebrating the liberation of the Syrian city of Manbij by burning the sombre outfits.
One girl grabbed the black burka she was wearing and pulled it off her head to reveal her face, an act which would have seen her severely punished under ISIS.
Meanwhile, another group of youngsters were seen dancing around a burka that has been discarded on the ground and left to burn.

Lawyer files FR petition on safeguarding, fostering Buddha Sasana
	
In the foremost interest of the Buddha Sasanaya and its affairs a lawyer activist yesterday filed a fundamental rights petition seeking to safeguard and foster the Buddha Sasana against any attack or threats.
Petitioner N. Dharshana Weraduwage said his petition had been filed in the backdrop of the recent vandalism of a Buddhist shrine room in Mankulam.
The respondents cited by him include -- Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake, Buddha Sasana and Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe, Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray and the AG on behalf of the President Maithripala Sirisena.
The petitioner said he was shocked and dismayed to read a news item headlined "Shrine room vandalised in Mankulam" published on page 1 of the August 31, Daily Mirror.
According to the news item, "A Buddhist shrine room erected within the premises of Special Task Force camp in Kanagarayankulam, Mankulam in the North had been vandalised on Monday 29.
?The camp set up after the war victory in 2009, does not exist in that location at present. The shrine room was constructed at the time for religious observances of the STF personnel.The Buddha statue has also been broken to pieces.?
The petitioner said this was not an isolated incident and during the past few months or even before, there have been demands for the removal of Buddhist Temples, Buddha Statues and shrines located especially in the Northern Province.
He said objections had been raised by many parties, including the NPC, MP R. Sampanthan and NPC councillor M. K. Shivajilingam.
He informed Court of a document addressed to Governor Cooray titled: ?Defending the Building of Buddhist Viharas and Erecting Buddha Statues by the Army/Navy in the North is Bad Politics.?
It states that this was not the first case where Buddhist viharas and statues have been erected by the Sri Lankan armed forces in the North and East, especially after May, 2009.
At Kanagarajankulam in the Kilinochchi district; at Mankulam in Vavuniya district; at Iranamadu in the Mullaitivu district; a Buddhist vihara at Vadduvaakal in the Mullaitivu district; a huge Buddhist vihara is under construction in Kokkulai in the Mullaitivu district after destroying the Hindu temple Karunaaddu Pillayar and a Buddhist vihara named Mahatota Raja Maha Vihara has been built within 50 meters of the famous Thirukethiswaram temple in the Mannar district.
The petitioner said in the event prompt, adequate and effective, action be taken to protect the Buddhist Temples, Shrines, Statutes and the Archaeological and Historical sites located in or around the Northern Province, they are at serious threat of being destroyed, vandalized or removed by force causing irreparable damage to Buddhist History, Culture, Religion, which the state is constitutionally mandated to give the Foremost Place and to Foster and Protect, by Article 9 of the Constitution.
He is asking Court to rule that no person on the sovereign territorial soil, seas and the air space has the power or authority whatsoever to interfere negatively or act against the affairs of the Buddha Sasana except as provided for by the Constitution.
The petitioner is asking Court to direct the respondents to take immediate action to investigate the incidents reported and to re-build, restore and refurbish all movable and immovable properties the Buddhist Shrine at Kanagarayan Kulam in Mankulam. (S. Selvanayagam)

MS a Terminator sent by UNP- PHU
	
The decision of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to contest the local government elections by on its own might backfire, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said today.
PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said it was not the practice of the SLFP to form a Government alone.
?Except in 1991, the SLFP lost whenever it contested at elections by itself. That party always went ahead with the backing of other progressive political parties,? he told a news conference.
During the 65th Anniversary of the SLFP, which was held on Sunday, President Maithripala Sirisena, the Chairman of the SLFP, said that they would contest the upcoming elections for the local government bodies alone.
The PHU and several other parties, including the National Freedom Front (NFF) and the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP), contested the previous Parliamentary elections under United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) ticket in which the main constituent is the SLFP.
Commenting on the new development, MP Gammanpila said President Sirisena was a ?Terminator? sent by the United National Party (UNP) to destroy the SLFP.
?The decision to contest alone is the final nail on the coffin of the SLFP. The entire situation is similar to the Hollywood movie Terminator, where an alien was sent on a destructive mission,? he said.
When asked about the impact the new decision would make on PHU, he said they would not accept invitations extended by the President to join.
?We joined the UPFA to form a government but one faction formed a coalition with the UNP instead. We are not ready to commit the same mistake twice,? Gammanpila said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte called Barack Obama a ?son of a whore? yesterday as he vowed not to be lectured by the US leader on human rights when they meet in Laos, AFP reported.
The acid-tongued Duterte bristled at warnings he would face questioning by the US president over a war against drugs in the Philippines that has claimed more than 2,400 lives in just over two months.
?You must be respectful. Do not just throw away questions and statements. Son of a whore, I will curse you in that forum,? Duterte told a news conference shortly before flying to Laos to attend a summit.
?We will be wallowing in the mud like pigs if you do that to me.? Duterte was due to hold a bilateral meeting with Obama on Tuesday afternoon on the sidelines of a gathering of global leaders hosted by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Vientiane, the Lao capital.
Meanwhile, BBC reported that US President Barack Obama has cancelled a meeting with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
Calling Duterte ?a colourful guy?, the US president said he asked his staff to find out whether a meeting would be useful.
?I always want to make sure if I'm having a meeting that it's actually productive and we're getting something done,? he told reporters.

After monitoring CCTV footage at the hotel, the police identified the suspect. After questioning the suspect, police found the mobile phone from a phone shop in Kotahena. The phone had been sold for Rs.200.
The shop owner was also arrested for possession of a stolen item. Police are investigating how the suspect entered the hotel premises despite private security being deployed at the hotel. (Indika Ramanayake)

PM on Malaysia: Attackers not Sri Lankans
	
Condemning the assault on Sri Lankan High Commissioner in Malaysia Ibrahim Ansar, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament today it was Malaysian Tamils of Indian origin responsible for the incident.
Making his remarks in response to a question by Joint Opposition?s Parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane, the Prime Minister said perpetrators were not Sri Lankans by any means.
He said those persons were members linked to a South India based political party called Naam Thamilar. He said that this party, lobbied internationally to refer Sri Lanka to an international war crimes tribunal.
However, the Prime Minister said the Government would dispatch a delegation to Malaysia to engage with them and brief them on measures being taken here for reconciliation among different ethnicities.
"A war crimes tribunal is not our intention. We have to brief them. We will send a team to South India as well," he said.
"We condemn the assault on the High Commissioner. Soon after the incident, I instructed the Acting Foreign Affairs Minister to summon the Malaysian Envoy and register our protest. The Malaysian Government is bound to give protection,? he said.
Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan Government has sought a full report on the incident.
Referring to the security of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, he said the Government would take the responsibility to give security and other entitled facilities. However, he said security personnel with fire arms could not be sent from Sri Lanka when travelling abroad.
"That is up for the host country. When I went to Singapore recently, two security personnel were with me. But, they are not allowed to carry weapons," he said.
He said the facilities entitled to a former President were accorded, when Mr. Rajapaksa was visiting South Korea and Japan.
Quoting a press statement issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of Malaysia, he said the Malaysian authorities regretted the incident, and assured to cooperate with the Sri Lankan mission to avoid repetition of such problems in future. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

PM proposes common health programme for SAARC and ASEAN
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday proposed that a common health programme be introduced for countries in the South Asian (SAARC) and ASEAN regions.
He made this proposal at the 69th sessions of the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Committee of South East Asia where he called for the inter-linking of regional organizations and programmes in the two regions with ASEAN and SAARC congregating and cooperating with each other to create a common health programme.
?ASEAN and SAARC can join together to set up one common health programme because diseases in countries such as Cambodia may be common to Sri Lanka as well. We can get together and provide a better health service and a better life for our people in our regions,? the Prime Minister said. ?Sri Lanka has had medical system for a long time beginning with the indigenous system of medicine which was developed over the years. Britain introduced the colonial health services. The Colombo Medical College was opened and became one of the oldest in the nation.?
?We had a war. The last ten years of it was challenging. We had to ensure that the hospitals were not targeted and see to it that health campaigns went on. I must say that immunization campaigns were conducted even in LTTE held areas. Now we have to face mental health issues,? he added.
The Prime Minister said the health issues faced by the world had changed from what it was earlier.
?Some 50 million people fought in the second world war with some 300 million being affected. Diseases spread, and thus health services became essential,? he said.?We live longer today. I read an article that said in 20 years time everyone will live up to 100 years. Every human organ can be copied and repaired today. These are all possibilities.?
The Prime Minister highlighted the fact that medical research went hand in hand with the discovery of new medicines to treat the illness people suffer from and asked whether we pay enough on research.
He said Sri Lanka was poised to cut down its debt to 53 per cent of the GDP by 2020 when it would become possible to spend more on health and education.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said Sri Lanka had made much progress in the health sector in the past few years and the WHO had contributed to that success.
WHO Director General Margaret Chan said health coverage was possible only to high income countries with many countries having access to good health systems today. ?Sri Lanka has shown the world that any country can provide its people with sound health facilities,? she said. (Yohan Perera)

Condemning the assault on Sri Lanka?s High Commissioner to Malaysia Ibrahim Ansar at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) on Monday, the SLFP acting General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake also condemned the protests that were held against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in Malaysia.
Addressing a media briefing at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) head quarters yesterday the Minister said that they opposed anyone, who made statements in foreign countries against Sri Lanka or Sri Lankans.
?Mahinda Rajapaksa was the person who won the civil war,? he said.
?Mahinda Rajapaksa was the only person who gave this freedom from the deadly LTTE. That was why now people of different nationalities can live in peacefully,? he said.
Meanwhile, the SLFP Spokesman and Minister Dilan Perera said, there were people left in the world, who called themselves as LTTEers. They are not real LTTEers but they are foxes in guise of tigers. As a country we should be very careful to not to create racialism in the country again. In Sri Lanka also we could find foxes in the guise of lions.

The CID had sent ten copies of the CDs containing the CCTV footage and 36 questions with regard to the Thajudeen murder. An ASP and a Sub Inspector attached to the CID visited the Canadian lab between August 22 to 31 with the CDs.??(Nirangi Abeywickreme)

The main Opposition Tamil National Alliance (TNA) today in Parliament 'unreservedly? condemned the assault of Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Malaysia Ansar and stressed that perpetrators should be brought to justice.
Making his remarks on the incident along with other party leaders, TNA leader R. Sampanthan said stringent action should be taken against offenders.
He said this was totally unwarranted at a time when Sri Lanka was moving towards harmony and stability.
He noted that such elements did not have the harmful consequences of their foolish acts. He said such acts would play into the hands of those not wanting stability in Sri Lanka.
Mr. Sampanthan said if offenders were Sri Lankans, they should be extradited to be charged here.
"We unreservedly condemn this incident," he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

WHO certifies Sri Lanka malaria-free
	
In a remarkable public health achievement, Sri Lanka was today certified by World Health Organization (WHO) on having eliminated malaria, a life-threatening disease which long affected the island country, WHO announced today.
?Sri Lanka?s achievement is truly remarkable. In the mid-20th century it was among the most malaria-affected countries, but now it is malaria-free. This is testament to the courage and vision of its leaders, and signifies the great leaps that can be made when targeted action is taken. It also demonstrates the importance of grass-roots community engagement and a whole-of-society approach when it comes to making dramatic public health gains,? WHO Regional Director, Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, said here.
Sri Lanka?s road to elimination was tough, and demanded well-calibrated, responsive policies. After malaria cases soared in the 1970s and 80s, in the 1990s the country?s anti-malaria campaign adjusted its strategy to intensively target the parasite in addition to targeting the mosquito.
The change in strategy was unorthodox, but highly effective. Mobile malaria clinics in high transmission areas meant that prompt and effective treatment could reduce the parasite reservoir and the possibility of further transmission. Effective surveillance, community engagement and health education, meanwhile, enhanced the ability of authorities to respond, and mobilized popular support for the campaign.
The adaptation/ flexibility of strategies and support from key partners such as WHO and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria fast-tracked success. By 2006, the country recorded less than 1 000 cases of malaria per year, and since October 2012, the indigenous cases were down to zero. For the past three-and-a-half years, no locally transmitted cases have been recorded.
To maintain elimination and ensure the parasite is not reintroduced to the country, the anti-malaria campaign is working closely with local authorities and international partners to maintain surveillance and response capacity and to screen high-risk populations entering the country.
Sri Lanka is the second country in the WHO South-East Asia Region to eliminate malaria after Maldives. The announcement of Sri Lanka?s victory over malaria was made at the WHO South-East Asia Region?s annual Regional Committee meeting in the presence of health ministers and senior health officials from all 11 Member States.
The Regional Director said WHO will continue to support the efforts of Sri Lanka?s health authorities as they relate to malaria, as well as the country?s wider public health mission. This outstanding achievement should be a springboard to further public health gains in the country and the South-East Asia Region as a whole. (WHO)
