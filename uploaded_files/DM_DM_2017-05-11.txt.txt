Appoint a JO councillor as NCPC chief minister
	
Anuradhapura district parliamentarian S.M. Chandrasena (UPFA) today threatened to mobilize the masses for a massive protest to be held outside the North-Central Provincial Council unless a joint opposition member was appointed chief minister.
He told the media that a crisis situation had erupted in the NCPC after the removal of K.H. Nandasena from his portfolio.
Transport Minister S.M. Ranjith has resigned from his portfolio in protest against Mr. Nandasena's removal. Several other ministers and councillors are concerned about the evolving situation. Several UPFA and JO parliamentarians met me with the JO councillors deciding to function independently and are keen to have one of them appointed as chief minister. The appointment of the chief minister should be decided by a majority vote. The government has resorted to undemocratic measures contrary to the policy of good governance. We are not prepared to let them go ahead in this manner," the MP said said. (Dayaratne Abogama)

JO not planning to grab power: MR
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today the joint opposition was not planning a conspiracy to grab power in the country.
"We are only opposed to the privatization and alienation of national resources," he told journalists after visiting Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy.
When asked about the removal of a Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) provincial councillor from his portfolio, Mr. Rajapaksa said what happens when some members are removed is this his or her colleagues also resign in protest.
He said when agreements are being signed with the United National Party (UNP), other parties raised objections.
The crux of the problem is not the decrease or increase of the support to any party. The people will show displeasure when other parties join the UNP. These protests against the government increase day by day. This exposes the political instability in the country, Mr. Rajapaksa said. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)

Kusal - Akusala Karma: Bearing the fruit of ones own deeds
	
Man is a social animal. According to Buddhism, nothing in this world just happens, takes place, comes up Nyamas, and exists on its own. Interaction or mutual cooperation is necessary for anything to happen.
The phenomena which interact for the existence of various things are called cause members. These cause members interact for the origin of anything. This is the law of causation in philosophy. In Buddhism, this state is explained as Hethu Phala Dharma or cause and effect. 
Although Buddhism attributes the inequality of mankind to Karma as one of the chief causes. It does not assert that everything is due to Karma. 
External forcesaffecting man
In this connection it may be useful to examine the external forces which affect the birth, existence and death of a human being. According to Buddhism there are five orders or processes, Nyamas which operate in the physical or mental realms. They are Uthu Niyama (physical inorganic order);Baja Niyama (physical organic order or order of germs and seeds etc.); Kamma Niyama (Order of action and result); Damma Niyama (order of norm); and lastly Chitta Niyama (order of mind or psychic law) 
Physical inorganic order (Uthu niyama)
Physical inorganic order includes natural physical order (Uthu niyama) order of seasons, characteristic seasonal changes and events, causes of wind, rain and heat etc. 
Physical organic order (Bija Niyama)
Physical organic order is the order of germs and seeds etc. Rice for instance is produced from the Rice seed; babies are born to parents and calves are born to cattle etc. This is the scientific theory of cells and genes. Because of this there is the physical similarity of the children in the same family. 
Order of action and result (Kama Niyama)
Order of action and result (Kama Niyama) is the virtuous or desirable acts producing good results and undesirable acts or deeds producing bad results. Kamma produces inevitable results not as rewards made or punishments imposed by a supernatural being or someone who is believed to be the Creator. The sequence of deeds and effects is as natural and necessary as the way of the sun and the moon. 
Order of Norm(Dhamma niyama)
Order of Norm (Dhamma niyama) or situation or way of behaviour that is usual or expected such as the natural phenomena occurring at the advent of a Bodhisattva in his last birth, gravitation or other similar laws of nature, the reason for being good and so forth may be included in this group. 
Order of mind or psychic law (Chitta niyama)
Order of mind or psychic law (Chitta niyama) examples of which are the process of consciousness, arising and perishing of consciousness, constituents of consciousness, power of mind, etc. Telepathy, retro-cognition, premonition, clairvoyance and thought reading. These psychic phenomena which are inexplicable to modern science are included in this class. 
Every mental or physical phenomenon could be explained by all these five embracing orders or processes which are laws in themselves. In spite of all these Niyamas or orders it is this doctrine of Karma that gives consolation, hope, self alliance and moral courage to a Buddhist. Rebirth takes place due to Karma. Past Karma conditions the present birth and the present Karma is added to the past Karma to condition the future birth. 
Good and bad volition (Kusala Akusala Cetana)
Kamma means good and bad volition (Kusala and Akusala Cetana). It is the voluntary action, thought or word other than Buddha and Arahants who do not accumulate fresh Kamma as they have destroyed passions. Kamma is the law of moral causation. Kamma is essentially followed by Vipaka, a result or effect. Kusala Kamma, meritorious or virtuous action brings good results in the same birth or in births to come. Similarly Akusala Kamma bad or demeritorious deeds bring misfortune or affliction. 
Kusala Kamma
There are ten kinds of Kusala Kamma such as Dana (Generosity), Seela (Morality), Bhavana (Meditation), Apacayana (Reverence), Veyyavachana (Service), Pattidana (Transfer of Merit), Pattanumodana (Rejoicing in others merit), Dhamma savanna (Hearing thee Doctrine), Dhamma Desana (Expounding the Doctrine) and DitthijjuKamma (Strengthening ones confidence).  Dana is the act of giving or offering with generosity. This yields wealth in the present life or in the future lives. 
Seelais morality or virtuousness, the observation of which result in birth of noble families and states of happiness. 
Bhavanais meditation which gives to births in form and formless realms and tends to gain higher knowledge and emancipation. 
Apacayanais reverence, respect and salutation or the act of paying honour and respect to those who worthy of it. Pujata pujaneyanan Effects of reverence are many one of which is noble parentage.  Veyyevacca is service rendered for others. This includes the support provide to parents, cherishing of wife and children and helping relatives and others. This ends to produce a large retinue. 
Pattidana is the act of transferring merit or giving merit by one who has acquired it to other persons. This serves as a cause to get in abundance in future births. 
Pattanumodana is rejoicing in others merit. This is to share the acts of merit performed by others although it has not been able to play the principal role oneself. This is productive merit wherever one is born. 
Dhamma savanna is hearing of Dhamma or listening to Dhamma and learning it for the realization of Nibbana. This Kusala Kamma promotes wisdom. 
Dhamma Desana is expounding the doctrine to enlighten others. This promotes the wisdom of the person concerned. Lastly, 
Ditthijju Kamma is the act of getting ones views strengthened. The mind of the doer of merit does not get fluttered. He or she is sorrow less, stainless and secured. This strengthens ones confidence. 
For Buddhists to have false view is to hold wrong views that block the way to Nibbana. This is not to have faith in the Triple Gem, Buddha, His doctrine, and His disciples the Sangha. It is to hold the view that there is no rebirth and that everything happens according to the wish and will of the supernatural person who has created the world.

Eighteen United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) councillors in the North-Central Provincial Council (NCPC) deciding to work independently will not make any impact on the functioning of the council, UPFA General Secretary and Minister, Mahinda Amaraweera said today.
He said problems would arise only if these members joined the United National Party (UNP), because it the main opposition in the council. The UPFA has 21 members in the NCPC.
When asked about the NCPCs Health Minister's removal on Wednesday and the resignation of the Trade Minister, Minister Amaraweera said these members had been promoting another party instead of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) of which they were members.
These members had not worked for the betterment of the SLFP. The replacement of the Health Minister is not an act of revenge. They have violated the SLFP Constitution by promoting another party in the recent past, he told Daily Mirror.
In the wake of the removal of the NCPC Health Minister on Wednesday, its Trade Minister S.M. Ranjith also resigned.
Mr. Ranjith had earlier that some 19 UPFA councillors were opposed to the current policies of the SLFP and as such had decided to function as an independent group. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Pakistani teen's hand chopped off for demanding salary
	
A Pakistani boys hand was cut off after his employer taught him a lesson for demanding food and his salary, according to local media reports.
The boy, 13, was reportedly employed by a landlady, identified as Shafqat Bibi, on a salary of 3,000 Pakistani rupees (around $29) to feed cattle and work at her house in Punjab province.
Last week, the boy allegedly refused to do his job until the landlady fed and paid him, as he was destitute and starving, 24 News HD channel reported.
Last week, Shafqat Bibi got furious with Irfan when he demanded [his] salary. She cut his right hand with a fodder-cutting machine to teach him a lesson that he demands salary but doesnt complete his job of feeding the cattle, the Hindustan Times quoted the boys mother as saying.
The boy was rushed to a local hospital after the incident, but doctors were unable to treat his badly injured hand.
The local police initially refused to register a case against the landlady, according to media reports. However, the boys mother turned to higher authorities to seek justice, and the incident has reportedly come to the attention of Punjab's chief minister, Shahbaz Sharif. The official has demanded a report from the police over the incident and their inaction, stating that the boys alleged mutilators should be dealt with according to the law.
A case was eventually filed against the landlady 10 days after the initial incident, and also named her brother and two other suspects. Shafqat Bibi was bailed, but her brother was arrested.
Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar took control of the case on Wednesday, demanding that the Punjab police submit a report on it within the next 48 hours. (rt.com)

Police allege Piliyandala shooting a trap
	
The grisly shooting that took place in Piliyandala on Tuesday night, killing an officer of the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB), is alleged to be a trap set up by leading underworld figure 'Matara Madush,' the police alleged yesterday.
Police Media Spokesman DIG Priyantha Jayakody told the Daily Mirror that according to information received, the police suspected that the PNB officers were allured into a trap by a false tip off.
It was reported that the PNB sleuths had agreed to purchase a stock of heroin, weighing three kilos and worth more than Rs.4 million, by a supporter of the notorious drug kingpin Matara Madush. Following the lead of an informant, the PNB officers had pursued to conduct the raid in Piliyandala. En route to the location, they had been ambushed outside the Peoples Bank Piliyandala Branch at around 8.45 p.m. by two unidentified gunmen who had opened fire at them.
The PNB officer, Constable Chaminda Abeywickreme (49446), who was severely wounded by the shooting, succumbed to his injuries on admission to the Kalubowila Teaching Hospital.
Police Inspector M. Neomal Rangajeewa and Constable Chaminda (67055) who sustained injuries were transferred to the Colombo National Hospital in critical condition. They were visited by IGP Pujith Jayasundara yesterday.
However, police said the motorcycle used by the suspects to flee the scene was found abandoned in Maharagama yesterday.
They said several vehicles including the three vehicles that transported the PNB officers were sprayed by bullets, and that six civilians including three children who sustained injuries were admitted to the Kalubowila Teaching Hospital.
However, police said further investigations into the shooting were being carried out by a special police team under the guidance of Western Province Senior DIG Nandana Munasinghe and Mount Lavinia Division SSP Chandana Athukorala.
Also, two other police teams have been deployed by Nugegoda Division SP Prasad Ranasinghe and Colombo Crime Division SSP to arrest the suspects. On the other hand, a PNB team led by DIG Kamal Silva is looking into the incident.
The funeral of the deceased will be held on Saturday (13) at the Marawila Public Cemetery with police honours.
It was learnt that the deceased police officer had been felicitated 112 times during his 15 years of service. Also, the injured Police Inspector, M. Numal Rangajeewa, was identified as a leading officer in the field. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Significance of  Vesak Poya & the fate of  Ata Pirikara Traders fake Ata Pirikara and manipulati
	
 We are the result of what we have thought. If you speak or act with an evil thought, pain follows you. If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never leaves him.- Buddha
The stunning saffron robe of the Buddhist bikkhu is far more than mere dress. It symbolises a simple ascetic life, a life of detachment. To us layman it is a symbol, which in essence represents the Buddha sasana of the past and present times. The moderate shades of browns and oranges thus encourage obeisance and a sense of humble veneration amongst devotees. A Bikkhu is thus characterised by this symbolic ornamentation and within its many folds lie preserved, an eternal and strict practice, since the times of the Buddha.
The then Public Administration and Buddha Sasana Minister Karu Jayasuriya in April 2015, said, 
There is a standardised version of the Buddhist flag which some people have embarked on to modify it; The sale of atapirikara too will be standardized and uniformed as it has been found that people were being deceived by unscrupulous traders, he even promised to draft gazette notifications on the standards to maintain proper standards; and any violators will be liable to be prosecuted. It was further explained that once the gazettes are issued, those selling atapirikara will be obligatory to register with the Ministry of Buddha Sasana and display their registration number on the product for public view and also be required to display the SLS certificate when selling the products. What transpired following the change of portfolios after the elections is not clear. 
Buddhist devotees must be very cautious in purchasing Ata-pirikara from shops for offering to ensure that it contains the proper belongings, the eight vital items in good quality which can be used by the bikkhus. They should make sure that ata pirikara conformed to the Buddhist specifications and standards when purchasing them. 
Eight items should include- [eightfold requisites as per vinaya rules] 
The most important item among offerings to Bikkhus is what is conventionally known as the eight monastic requisites or Ata-pirikara. As it is a costly item and therefore difficult to offer to every monk, generally one Ata-Pirikara is offered to the head monk and various other items such as books, towels, umbrellas, etc., are given to the other monks. 
Aluminium Paththaraya [begging bowl] 
Depota Sivura (challenger Material). 
Thanipota Sivura (challenger Material). 
Andana Sivura (challenger Material). 
Banda Patiya [belt] 
Perahankadaya.[filter] 
Idikatu/Nuulbola (needle and ball of thread). 
Dali Pihiya (razor). 
Raids on Atapirikara shops
The Consumer Affairs Protection Authority (CAA) investigation teams raided shops selling Atapirikara a couple of years ago, which resulted in the fake and substandard Atapirikara products vanishing from the market. CAA Director General once said it appeared that all inferior Atapirikara products have disappeared from the shelves. The traders in the past did not defraud the temple, because they respected the Buddhist monks. But some traders have now begun to deceive not only the devotees but also the Ata Pirikara that is being offered to the Maha Sangha. The operations to examine shops, the officials of the Consumer Authority examined the Ata Pirikara under the guise of buying them. They succeeded in indicting several shops that were selling Ata Pirikara in a fraudulent manner. The officials said they launched this initiative following complaints by Temples and the public. The CAA has called on the public to constantly inform them of such malpractices. Thus the CAA under the directions of Hon Karu Jayasuriya have made great inroads into preventing the unscrupulous trader from deceiving the Buddhist religious sector. 
Alms giving is one of the most widespread practices among Buddhists. Its a way to maintain the monks, who study and perform the Buddhas teachings, by offering them food. At the same time, the person who offers learns to give and to let go. The earlier practice was to wait for the traders to call over at regular intervals [mostly non-Buddhist] that will make meager payment for the temple and remove them in bulk form to be repacked using more attractive new packing materials making it re-saleable at higher price to the unsuspecting devotee. 
The cycle continues like thekarmic-cycle! 
However, it looks as if the temple authorities, especially the Dayakas by themselves or in connivance with some saffron robed monks, have taken over the task of misleading or deceiving the devotees to collect monies either for the temple coffers or may be even for their nefarious activities. Most of the temples, has found a new and more profitable way of disposing of large quantities of Atapirikara collected during Katina rituals and at alms offers. The representatives of dayaka sabha will visit homes and explain the agenda of the on coming pinkama, and instead of asking for a donation they make a more attractive suggestion, that a member of the family can participate at the procession carrying a valuable Atapirika, and that the material is available at the temple for a very reasonable price of Rs 500/- to 1000/- depending on the ability. Naturally, the gullible devotee surmise it as a life time opportunity to make an offer of a sacred Pirikara, and that too after exposing it to the public at the pinkama for such an unbelievable sum; without a hum he will except the idea and pay the money and finally return the Atapirikara back to the same temple. The cycle continues like the karmic cycle. 
The practice has been extended to alms giving held at Seventh-day, Three-month and Annual merit transfer on dead. Instead of carrying a small pirikara or some consumer product to the venue by the invitees eg. Two kilos of sugar or a packet of biscuits, a packet of milk powder etc., they now approach a member of the dayaka sabha or in some instances directly the high priest of the nearest temple where the practice is encouraged, for an Atapirikara at the same cost, but proudly carry it to the place to be offered as a holy pujawa. The cycle continues with the parcel intact; even those who offer, accept and sell are clueless about the contents of it. Can the participant share this donation with deceased family members and associates and pass merits or pin
to them 
Can the Minister of Buddhasasana or the CAA Interfere
The Minister of Buddhasasana or the CAA has little to do with this unscrupulous practice. But the honourable minister who is a Buddhist scholar would certainly understand the depth of deterioration of values among temple authorities as a result of such dishonest and immoral behaviour of authorities who act as guardians of Buddhism. It is high time he takes this matter up with the Mahanayaka theros of all nikayas for immediate remedial action. 
Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.-Buddha
Significance ofVesak Poya
Prince Siduhath, who later became Buddha was born on a Vesak day. Of all Poya days, the Vesak Poya Day is of highest significance as it marks three main events in the life of Lord Buddha. It was on a Vesak day that enlightenment and the parinibbana of Lord Buddha took place. 
This insight and light that flashed and spread out under the Bodhi Tree at Buddha Gaya in Bihar in Northern India, more than 25 centuries ago, is of great significance to mans destiny. It lighted up the way by which mankind could cross, from a world of superstition, to a new world of light, of true compassion and happiness. 
The Teachings of the Buddha are contained in the Four Noble Truths, namely - 
The Noble Truth of Dukkha or suffering 
The Origin or Cause of suffering 
The Cessation of suffering 
Path which leads to the cessation of sufferings 
The First Noble Truth is the Dukkha which has been generally translated as suffering. But the term, which represents the Buddhas view of life and the world, has a deeper rational meaning. Birth, old age, disease and death are universal. All beings are subject to this dissatisfaction. Parting with beloved ones and pleasurable conditions, relationship with unpleasant personnel and conditions, and not getting what one wishes - these are also sources of suffering and dissatisfaction. The Buddha sums up Dukkha in what is known as the Five Grasping Aggregates. 
Herein, lies the deeper rational meaning of Dukkha for it encompasses the whole state of being or continuation. The whole process of living is seen as a flux of forces comprising of the five aggregates, namely the Aggregate of Form or the Physical process, Mental Formation, Feeling, Perception, and Consciousness. These are usually classified as mental and physical procedures, which are constantly in a state of flux or transformation. If we train our minds to observe the performance of mental and physical processes we will comprehend the true nature of our lives. We will see how it is subject to transformation and dissatisfaction. And as such, there is no real matter or entity or Self which we can cling to as I, me or mine. 
At the age of eighty years, Gautama Buddha had his last supper offered to him by a lady named Sujatha. He inclined on the couch placed between two Sala trees and attained Parinibbana on a Vesak Full Moon Poya Day. 
It is better to conquer yourself than to win a thousand battles. Then the victory is yours. It cannot be taken from you, not by angels or by demons, heaven or hell.
May all beings be happy!

SL regains much-awaited GSP+ from EU
	
Sri Lankas GSP+ application was approved by the Council of Ministers of the European Union (EU) Thursday evening resuming the much-awaited trade concession to the country, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Harsha de Silva said.
He said the concession would come into effect in less than two weeks. It would only take 10 or 12 days for the EU to issue a gazette making it the law now. This is a huge victory for the government of Sri Lanka as well as the exporters of the country, Dr. de Silva told Daily Mirror.
It was only in late April a resolution submitted by a group of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) saying that the GSP+ should not be granted to Sri Lanka, was defeated by a majority of votes in the European Parliament in Belgium.
A total of 436 members voted against the resolution while 119 voted in favour. Twenty two members abstained from voting on the resolution.
Dr. de Silva was also in Belgium to assist the Sri Lankan mission in laying groundwork to defeat the resolution.
Upon returning on April 29, the Deputy Minister said that regaining the GSP+ trade concession should be used as a platform for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU.
The GSP+ concession will be in practice for four years at most. This is why we need to sign a FTA with the EU, Dr. de Silva told a news briefing held at the Foreign Ministry.
The GSP+ allows a developing country to pay less or zero duties on its exports to all 28 EU member-states.
The EU withdrew the GSP+ trade facility given to Sri Lanka in 2010 owing to significant shortcomings in respect of the countrys implementation of three UN human rights conventions relevant to qualify for the benefits under the scheme. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Thailand is unlikely to be able to sign the Free-Trade Agreement (FTA) with Sri Lanka this year as expected, a high-ranking Thai state official has told the Bangkok Post.
Director-general of the Trade Negotiations Department, Boonyarit Kalayanamit has said the planned Thailand-Sri Lanka FTA is still being studied and is likely to be completed in July.
"We expect the two dialogue partners to open talks late this year, starting with the liberalisation of trade in goods," he said.
On Feb 17, Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak, who met Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, said the two countries aimed to sign an FTA later this year to triple bilateral trade to US$1.5 billion over the next five years.
Mr. Somkid also proposed that Thailand and Sri Lanka conduct parallel strategic cooperation in certain areas in order to expedite mutual economic benefit for the two countries, as FTAs require time for negotiations.
The cooperation is set to be conducted both on a government-to-government and private-to-private basis.
The sectors in which Sri Lanka is eager to attract Thai investment include jewellery, electronics, consumer products and industrial estates, the news article said.
Sri Lanka and Thailand first began considering an FTA in 2016, when Mr. Somkid made an official visit to Sri Lanka.
The two countries also signed a memorandum of understanding on technical cooperation, a letter of intent on cooperation in small and medium-sized enterprise development and a joint programme on tourism for the period of 2016-2018.
Mr. Boonyarit said the Thai government intends to kick off the trade talks as quickly as possible, particularly on issues where the two countries are most prepared, including trade in goods, before extending talks to cover the service and investment sectors.

SL urgently needs a high-end platform: China
	
China has said Sri Lanka is in urgent need of a high-end platform and the Port City Project is planned in the best interests of Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka is in urgent need of a high-end platform to attract financial institutions, multinational companies, shoppers, tourists as well as providing jobs to well-educated locals as a part of its post-war reconstruction. The Port City project is planned in the best interests of Sri Lanka, said Sun Ziyu, Vice President of China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) in an interview with the South China Morning Post.
China is building a new city along Colombos coastline that will become the citys central business district by 2030, creating 80,000 jobs for Sri Lankans, under the mainlands Belt and Road Initiative.
With an initial investment of US$1.4 billion, Colombo Port City is Chinas biggest project in Sri Lanka, a key node along the Maritime Silk Road of the Belt and Road plan.
Sun said the development within Sri Lankas biggest commercial city, which will be built on 269 hectares of reclaimed land, would accommodate 200,000 residents and consists of apartments, hotels, offices, shopping malls, exhibition centres.
He said the reclamation work had helped transform the areas coastline which was previously hit by strong winds blowing towards the Indian Ocean making it less livable.
This has also improved coastal protection, and is a boon to the environment, he said.

Sri Lankan in Canada appeals against attempt to deport him
	
A Sri Lankan man, who successfully claimed refugee status in Canada after fleeing the country, is still waiting to become a full Canadian citizen because his case is snarled due to the changes in the Immigration Policy, the CBC News reported on Thursday.
The 36-year-old man N.A.M.N. came to Vancouver during the war in Sri Lanka in 2008.
His lawyer Doug Cannon has said the Lankan followed the rules when he made two return trips home, but now that Canada's immigration laws have changed, he's caught in a legal limbo.
"He's a law-abiding refugee who is now being told to get lost," said Cannon, who has filed for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, questioning whether or not refugees are equal to other immigrants.
The case could affect hundreds of other refugees impacted by legislative changes made by the Conservative government in 2012.
Those changes allow the government to revoke permanent residency status for settled refugees, if the person travels back to their home country, uses their old passport or applies for a new passport.
The rules are based on the fact that a refugee fleeing from a dangerous situation needs Canada's protection and can't return to their home.
N.A.M.N. says that when the civil war was over three years later, he returned home twice to visit his ailing mother and then to get married.
When he returned from his trip with his new wife, they dreamed of starting a family in Vancouver. But in the meantime, changes to the law allowed officials to reopen asylum files.
Cannon says the focus on pushing people out suggests "refugees really are just opportunists  or they are a constant burden on our society, and we should get rid of as many as we can.
N.A.M.N. only learned he was being flagged for his earlier trips home after writing his citizenship tests in 2015 and awaiting word of the date for his swearing-in ceremony.
Nilam's wife, Fathima, 30, has obtained permanent residency status  but Nilam may now be deported, despite living in Vancouver, working as a taxi driver, paying taxes like a "model citizen," says his lawyer.

The Day of Triple Significance Buddhas Maiden Discourse Dhammacakka Pavattana Suttantam
	
Namo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato Samma Sumbuddhassa!Siddharta Gautama, the crown prince of Kapilavastu was born on a Vesak full moon day, at the Lumbini Park of the Nepalese border in 623 BC. 
The prince was the only son of Queen Mahamaya and the Sakyan King Suddhodana. At the age of 29, the strongly determined prince left his palace, leaving his loving princes Yasodara and his one-day-old son Rahula. Abandoning all royal luxuries he renounced the World, becoming a penniless ascetic philosopher and wandered into forestry retreat. 
Being a hermit, he strenuously suffered and struggled stupendously, to realize the sublime truth for six long years. 
In the company of distinguished ascetics Alara Kalama, Uddaka Ramaputra and in association with five great ascetics Kondanna, Bhadiya, Vappa, Mahanama and Assaji, Ascetic Siddhartha engaged in spiritual practices. 
He equalled and even surpassed the standards of his teachers but remained unsatisfied with whatever discipline, doctrine and high degree of mental concentration which did not answer his problems of disgust, detachment, cessation of suffering, tranquillity, intuition, Enlightenment and Nibbhana.
Thence, he declined to accept the offer made to him to be the head of all ascetics and realized that the austerities and mortifications were extremity and fruitless. 
Though he had achieved the mastery of mind in their association, his quest to seek the highest truth remained unachieved. His mission was to seek the highest goal Nibbhana! The complete cessation of suffering, the total eradication of all forms of craving thus he decided to continue his great efforts through the moderate Middle Path (Majjhima patipada), in solitude. Abandoning the practices of indulgence in sensual pleasures (Kamasukhallikanuyoga), as well as addiction to self mortification (Attakilamatanuyoga), the two extremes. He followed the Majjhim Patipada, being the only path which leads a recluse to tranquillity, realization, enlightenment and Nibbhana.
Relying on his own efforts on a glorious Vesak full moon day, Sakyamuni Tathagata Gautama, aged 35, attained Supreme Enlightenment under the shade of the Jaya SriMaha Bodhi at Gaya, 2640 years ago. The intensity of this serene joy and pious emotion was so overwhelming that it permeated His entire Golden  Hued Body and the Six-coloured glorious rays, emanated from the Body downwards penetrating the Earth, water and Air, and further blazed forth upwards like the Rays of the Glorious Sun into the different realms of existence extending as far as the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception. 
This rare and extraordinary phenomenon is thus described as the Buddha Rashmi.  
The Purity and Sublimity, the Serenity and Tranquillity of His mind generated sparkling and wholesome material qualities which left their imprint on His Personality and the colour of His Blood became Pure, Pellucid and Clear and as a result Rays of Six Colours  Indigo, Gold, Red, White, Tawny and Dazzling issued from the Body of the Blessed One. In his bliss of Emancipation and transcendental moral victory the Buddha uttered his delightful maiden words the Paean of joy. 
Anekajati samsaram sandhavissam anibbisam Gahakarakam gavesanto dukkha jati punappunam Gahakaraka, dittho si puna geham na kahasi Sabba te phasuka bhagga gahakutam visamkhitam Visamkharagatam cittam tanhanam khayam ajjhaga Thro many a birth in existence wandered I. Seeking, but not finding, the builder of this house.
Sorrowful is repeated birth. O housebuilder, thou art seen. Thou shalt build no house again.
All thy rafters are broken. Thy ridge-pole is shattered. Mind attains the Unconditioned. Achieved is the End of Craving.
Buddha having spent the significant seven weeks (Satsati), remained in contemplation on the subtleties and intricacies of his unique discovery. He experienced ecstatic bliss & unalloyed happiness.  The Buddha appears in this World out of boundless compassion, for the good benefit and happiness of gods and men.  Being surface seers the average society fails to diagnose the eternal factors that the life is suffering. Always a Buddha who rarely appears in the World, reveals the eternal truths to the deluded World that life is suffering and sorrowful. As a treatment, to overcome this painful sansarik journey or the cycle of rebirth, the Buddha expounded the Four Noble Truths as well as the Eightfold Noble path for benefit of all recluses (Pabbjitena). 
Meanwhile the hosts of divine beings of many realms were eagerly awaiting to listen to the message of the Buddha. Thereupon, the chief of divine society Maha Brahma, paid his highest obeisance to the Enlightened One! and invited the Buddha, to disclose the Sublime Truths, to the World and to salvage endless suffering, beings who were intelligent and competent to realize the Dhamma. 
Thereupon, the Buddha set forth to visit to Mighadaya (dear park), Isipatane of the Uruwela Dannawwa, to preach the five Brahmin ascetics, who were his past companions. 
On seeing the Buddha coming back to them, the five ascetics took a decision not to greet him or welcome him warmly. However, as the Buddha approached closer they automatically performed the preliminaries and respectfully offered him a seat. Still unaware that the Buddhahood Gautama, was now Enlightened, they began to address him as an equal. Then the Buddha explained to them that it was improper to address the Tathagata, by name or treat him as an equal. 
The Tatgagata, O Bhikkhus! is not luxurious has not given up striving and has not turned into a life of abundance. An Exalted One is the Tathagata. A fully Enlightened One is He. Listen Bhikkhus! Deathlessness has been attained. I shall instruct and teach you the Dhamma. The adamant ascetics who were initially reluctant to give ear, finally yielded to learn. 
O, Bhikkhus: There are these two extremes (anta), O Bhikkhus, which should be avoided by one who has renounced (pabbajitena).
Kamasukallikanu Yoga, 
(1) Indulgence in sensual pleasures  this is base, vulgar, worldly, ignoble and profitless; and, 
Attakilamatanu Yoga,
(11) Addiction to self-mortification  this is painful, ignoble and profitless. 
Abandoning both these extremes the Tathagata has comprehended the Middle Path (Majjhima Patipada) which promotes sight (Cakkhu) and knowledge (nana), and which tends to peace (vupasamaya), higher wisdom (abhinnaya), Enlightenment (sambodhaya), and Nibbana. 
What, O Bhikkhus, is that Middle Path, the Tathagata has comprehended which promotes sight and knowledge, and which tends to peace, higher wisdom, Enlightenment, and Nibbana 
The very Noble Eightfold Path  namely, (1) Right Understanding (samma ditthi), (2) Right Thoughts (samma sankappa), (3) Right Speech (samma vaca), (4) Right Action (samma kammanta), (5) Right Livelihood (samma ajiva), (6) Right Effort (samma vayama), (7) Right Mindfulness (samma sati), and (8) Right Concentration (samma Samadhi), This O Bhikkhus is the Middle Path which the Tathagata has comprehended. (The Buddha continued): 
Now this, O Bhikkhus, of the Four Noble Truths, Suffering is dukkha-ariya-sacca!
Birth is suffering, decay is suffering, disease is suffering, death is suffering, to be united with the unpleasant is suffering, to be separated from the pleasant is suffering, not to get what one desires is suffering. In brief the five aggregates of attachment are suffering. Thefive aggregates compose the Pancupadanakkhandha  According to Buddhism this so-called being is composed of five groups, viz: Rupa (matter), Vedana (feeling), Sanna (perception), Samkhara (mental states) and Vinnana (consciousness). These are the five psycho-physical component parts that constitute an individual. Matter is composed of forces and qualities. Mind too, is composed of mental states (cetasikas). They are fifty-two in number. Of them vedana, and Sanna are treated as two distinct groups. The remaining fifty are collectively called Sankhara.
Now, this, O Bhikkhus, secondly is the Noble Truth of the cause of suffering (dukkha-samudaya-ariyasacca):  It is this craving which produces rebirth (ponodhavika), accompanied by passionate clinging, welcoming this and that (life). It is the craving for sensual pleasures (kama tanha), craving for existence (bhava Tanha) and craving for non-existence (vibhava tanha).  Now this, O Bhikkhus, thirdly is the Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering (dukkha  nirodha  ariyasacca). It is the complete separation from, and destruction of, this very craving, its forsaking, renunciation, the liberation therefrom, and non attachment there to. 
Now, this, O Bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering (dukkha-nirodha-gamini-patipada-ariya-sacca). 
It is this Noble Eightfold Path  namely, Right Understanding, Right Thoughts, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration. 
(1).This is the Noble Truth of Suffering. 
Thus, O Bhikkhus, with respect to things unheard before, there arose in me the eye, the knowledge, the wisdom, the insight, and the light. 
This Noble Truth of Suffering should be perceived (parinneyya). 
Thus, O Bhikkhus, with respect to things unheard before, there arose in me the eye, the knowledge, the wisdom, the insight, and the light. 
This Noble truth of suffering has been perceived (parinnata). 
Thus, O Bhikkhus, with respect to things unheard before, there arose in me the eye, the knowledge, the wisdom, the insight, and the light.  
(2).This is the Noble Truth of the cause
of suffering. 
Thus, O Bhikkhus, with respect to things unheard before, there arose in me the eye, the knowledge, the wisdom, the insight, and the light. 
This is the Noble Truth of the cause of suffering should be eradicated (pahatabba).
Thus, O Bhikkhus, with respect to things unheard before, there arose in me the eye, the knowledge, the wisdom, the insight, and the light. 
This Noble Truth of the cause of suffering has been eradicated (pahinam). 
Thus, O Bhikkhus, with respect to things unheard before, there arose in me the eye, the knowledge, the wisdom, the insight, and the light. 
(3).This is the Noble Truth of cessationof suffering. 
Thus, O Bhikkhus, with respect to things unheard before, there arose in me the eye, the knowledge, the wisdom, the insight, and the light. 
This Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering should be realized (sacchikatabba). 
Thus, O Bhikkhus, with respect to things unheard before, there arose in me the eye, the knowledge, the wisdom, the insight, and the light. 
This Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering has been realized (sacchikatam).
Thus, O Bhikkhus, with respect to things unheard before, there arose in me the eye, the knowledge, the wisdom, the insight, and the light. 
(4).This is the Noble Truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering. 
Thus, O Bhikkhus, with respect to things, unheard before, there arose in me the eye, the knowledge, the wisdom, the insight, and the light. 
This Noble Truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering should be
developed (bhavetabbam).
Thus, O Bhikkhus, with respect to things unheard before, there arose in me the eye, the knowledge, the wisdom, the insight, and the light. 
This Noble Truth of the Path leading to the cessation of suffering has been
developed (bhavitam).
Thus, O Bhikkhus, with respect to things unheard before, there arose in me the eye, the knowledge, the wisdom, the insight, and the light. 
(concluding His discourse, the
Buddha declared): 
As long, O Bhikkhus, as the absolute true intuitive knowledge regarding these Four Noble Truths under their three aspects and twelve modes was not perfectly clear to me, so long I did not acknowledge in this world inclusive of gods, Maras and Brahmas and amongst the hosts of ascetics and priests, gods and men, that I had gained the Incomparable Supreme Enlightenment (anuttaram
samma-sambodhim).
When, O Bhikkhus, the absolute true intuitive knowledge regarding these Four Noble Truths under their three aspects and twelve modes, became perfectly clear to me, then only did I acknowledge in this world inclusive of gods, Maras, Brahmas amongst the hosts of ascetics and priests, gods and men, that I had gained the Incomparable
Supreme Enlightenment.  
And there arose in me the knowledge and insight (nanadassana)  Unshakable is the deliverance of my mind. This is my last birth, and now there is no existence again.  
Thus the Exalted One discoursed, and the delighted Bhikkhus applauded the words of the
Exalted One. 
When this doctrine was being expounded there arose in Ven. Kondanna, the dustless, stainless, Truth seeing Eye (Dhammacakkhu), and he saw that whatever is subject to origination all that is subject to cessation. 
When the Buddha expounded discourse of the Dhammacakka, the earth-bound deities exclaimed: - This excellent Dhammacakka which could not be expounded by any ascetic, priest, god Mara or Brahma in this world has been ex-pounded by the Exalted One at the Deer Park, in Isipatana, near Benares.
Hearing this proclamation the Devas Catummaharajika, Tavatimsa, Yama, Tusita, Nimmanarati, Paranimmitavasavatti, and the Brahmas of Brahma Parisajja, Brahma Purohita, Maha Brahma, Parittabbha, Appamanabha, Abhassara, Parittasubha, Appamanasubha, Subhakinna, Vehapphala, Aviha, Atappa, Sudassa, Sudassi, and Akanittha, also raised the same joyous cry.  
Thus at that very moment, at that very instant, this cry ascended as far as the Brahma realm. These ten thousand world systems quaked, tottered and trembled violently.  
A radiant light, surpassing the effulgence of the gods, appeared in the world. Then the Exalted One! declared, indeed, Kondanna has indeed understood. Kondanna has indeed comprehended The Truth  
Accordingly Venerable Kondanna, was named Annata Kondanna. 
Dhammacakka Pavattana Suttantum, means the sermon of the Establishment of the Wheel of Truth. 
Thus, the Buddha for full 45 years fulfilled his duties as the Buddha until he reclined at the age of 80, on a Vesak full moon Day 2561 years ago, at Mallas Sala grove at Kusinara. 
Sabba Papassa Akaranam Kusalassa Upasampada Sacitta Pariodapanam Etam Buddhana Sasanam!
Refrain from all evil acts - cultivate meritorious deeds, maintain good governance of ones mind is the doctrine of the Buddha!
