Adverse weather: Death toll rises to 11
	
The death toll from the prevailing adverse weather conditions had increased to 11 persons, while another five still reported missing, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) reported.
DMC Deputy Director Pradeep Kodippili said three bodies belonging to fishermen, who were reported missing since Wednesday (29) had been found a short while ago in Galle. 
Despite the gale force winds which later developed into cyclone ?OCKHI? moved away from the country to some 750 km West of Colombo while torrential rains lashed most parts of the country today with the water levels of several rivers including Nilwala Ganga, Gin Ganga and Kalu Ganga breaching their banks.
The Meteorology Department said with the depression moving away from the country the rains too would lessen during the next few days. Disaster Management Centre said 77,481 people from 23,884 families were affected by the weather conditions. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

blissfully Celebrating Christmas
	
?Sad December now is here? was the first line of a song that was taught to us when we were in the Primary school. Of course, the song was based on the dismal gloom of the winter season in the West. To us in our blessed and blissful tropical isle, it is the month all of us have been awaiting eleven months; the month of merry making, without realising why, going on shopping sprees only to complain later of the high cost of living, listening to stale Christmas Carols played ad infinitum and best of all, eating unhealthy food without the slightest restraint just for the sake of ending up in a free hospital, with two patients on one bed!??
Superficially, it looks meaningless why those who belong to other religions should celebrate Christmas. But at the same time, the message of the angels to the shepherds was ,? Rejoice and be glad ??Behold I bring you Good tidings of comfort and joy??Peace on earth , Goodwill to all men. (The last two are rare commodities in the modern world!) So far as the Biblical command is concerned, it is quite alright for those of other religions to celebrate the birth of our Lord.??
Psychologists say that those who are addicted to the bottle are emotionally immature
The way they celebrate!
While all have the right to celebrate Christmas, the absurdity of it is the way many people celebrate it. Many years ago, I went to the Central Y.M.C.A.for a haircut in Colombo, on 27 or 28 of December. While I was having my hair cut, there were two gentlemen seated behind me, awaiting their turn. I couldn?t help listening to them when one of them asked, ?Machchan, how was Christmas with you??? ?
The other replied, ?Very good, machchan. I enjoyed very much. I had two bottles.???
They were obviously not soft drinks! I was saddened to hear that their sense of enjoyment was to have liquor.??
I am also aware of another person, who was perpetually drunk. His excuse was that his wife didn?t write to him regularly
Those who are addicted to liquor justify their drinking habit by trotting out lame excuses. One is to say that Jesus too drank wine. That was true. Wine was drunk during that era, during those days.??
I am personally aware of one person who said, ?After all, drinking is the only way we could have a heart-to-heart ?talk with a friend and the only time we could sing?. I happened to hear it, but I kept mum. I said to myself, ?Well, I could do both talk or sing without liquor.? ?
I am also aware of another person, who was perpetually drunk. His excuse was that his wife didn?t write to him regularly. I knew of his movements. I found out that he drank heavily, even when he was in the same house with his wife! Another reason given by drinking braggarts is that they are more manly, while the non-drinkers aren?t. Maybe, that?s because they realize that they lack manliness in other ways. (No pun intended!)??
Lame excuses?
So much so, for lame excuses. When I was working in a charitable organization, headed by a retired, high-ranking army officer, it was pointed out that I was very immature, because I didn?t drink. My father found this accusation most ridiculous. He asked me, ?Is drunkenness a qualification in that office??What I didn?t tell them was that immaturity was in them and not in me. Psychologists say that those who are addicted to the bottle are emotionally immature.
My father who never drank nor smoked and ate only one piece of anything sweet, lived up to the age of 91. I always think that he would have lived longer, if my brother and I had not gone abroad as political exiles, leaving him without any male support??
You all are very familiar with the story of the Nativity. The birth of Jesus was announced first to the shepherds and not to the V.I.P.s of the area. It was because the shepherds were treated as outcasts at that time. The message was clear. Jesus came to save all,including the poor and the outcasts.??
The bottle that you had on Christmas day last year-- does it still give you the same happiness???

BMI Keeping a check on your child?s weight
	
?
In the current day and age children lead sedentary lifestyles and have more access to fast food, making gaining weight a serious health issue. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a calculation made by taking into account the height and weight of a child. BMI assesses whether or not the child is overweight. According to Dr. Kosala Karunaratne, Consultant Pediatrician, Lady Ridgeway Hospital, BMI is the gauge used to check obesity worldwide. It is one of the best indicators when dealing with the children?s health.? ?
?
What this indicator represents? ?
Speaking about the relevance of BMI, Dr. Karunaratne said,?It?s the gauge we use to check obesity worldwide. In children, BMI is one of the best indicators for obesity. The important thing is you have to use the relevant age and gender charts. You should be careful about not checking the adult chart. The children?s and adult?s charts are different because children are growing therefore their BMI is always changing. The BMI is determined by taking into account the height and the weight. If it isn?t checked by the proper chart, it is not accurate,?Dr. Karunaratne said.?
He further said,?BMI is different from children to adults. It depends on the age and the gender of the child. And we usually check the BMI between 2 to 18 years. There are special charts in that age group. Depending on the child?s age and gender there are separate charts. In fact these charts are included in the child health records, which all Sri Lankan children possess. This isn?t the normal growth chart. There is a BMI chart in medicine as well. Some health professionals aren?t aware of the fact that this book contains a BMI. The BMI of the child can easily be checked through this. You can calculate the child?s BMI or you can download an app as a BMI calculator, so you don?t have to calculate manually. So what you do is check the child?s age. If the child is a girl or a boy check the BMI. Depending on the BMI you can classify them as either obese or overweight,? the doctor said.?
Speaking about the values of BMI, Dr. Karunaratne said, ?Between the 50th and 85th percentile, they are overweight. Over the 85th percentile they are obese. The children who are overweight are at risk of becoming obese. You don?t usually check the BMI for children under 2 years, but you check their weight per age and see whether they are overweight. These height and weight charts are also available in the child health records. If a child is overweight you have to be cautious. If the child becomes obese, such children are exposed to many health risks, both during childhood and adulthood. So it?s very important to screen them for obesity and take necessary action,? Dr. Karunaratne said.?
?
Having a high reading? ??
Having a BMI over the 85th percentile indicates that your child is obese. Dr. Karunaratne went on to explain the complications that occur due to obesity in childhood.?Obese children can have many medical complications as well as psychological complications. Some of the medical complications during childhood are; they can develop a condition called metabolic syndrome (which is where their cholesterol and sugar can rise) or they can even develop high pressure and cardiac diseases, even during childhood. And they also run a high risk of developing all of these conditions in their adult life as well. In addition to this they have a high risk of developing asthma and also sleep disorders. Such individuals during sleep can have obstructions. And due to being overweight they can experience joint problems. There are other complications. They can also develop psychological problems. They can be bullied and some of them can develop depression and psychiatric problems,? the doctor explained.?
?Obesity is almost like a global epidemic. The most effected by this condition are children. Because of fast food and TV games children nowadays are leading very sedentary lifestyles. As a result they lack? exercise. In the olden days children used to play on the road with the neighbourhood children. But they don?t do this anymore. And most of the urban families have a higher risk of having obese children. That is because the parents are also busy and working. They have no time to give nutritious meals to their children, so they buy fast food.? he continued.?
?
?
Lowering your energy intake?
Speaking on how one must lower the BMI, Dr. Karunarante explained that you simply have to ?lower your energy intake compared to your energy expenditure?. ?Energy intake is your food and the expenditure is your activity. The main way to control the energy intake is through your diet. So you have to control the diet. Food with nutritional value with less refined sugar- present in sweets- and sugar added into tea must be given. And if the child is consuming carbohydrates it?s better to take what is called wholemeal, which has more fiber such as brown rice and brown bread. They don?t cause a very high rise in blood sugar like wheat does. This is how blood sugar works. When you consume a lot of sugar your blood sugar rises. Then you have a hormone called insulin, and as a response to this the insulin rises. What the insulin does is deposit these sugars as fat in your body. But when you take wholemeal carbohydrates the insulin won?t rise erratically. This is one of the main physiological reasons as to why a person gains weight. Since diet is a problem, you have to have a balanced diet comprising proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. You should use a food plate where you can balance the vegetables, proteins, carbohydrates etc. Fast food should be avoided. All fast food contain high sugar, thus the presence of many calories. Avoid carbonated drinks which also have a much sugar,? he affirmed.?
?With regard to energy expenditure you have to make your child more active. The WHO has advised that the child should have at least 60 minutes of moderate to high rate exercise for a day. That is active play. It is very important that the family is healthy. It is up to the parents to buy good nutritious food and lead a healthy lifestyle,? he continued.? ?
?In our culture we think that if the child has a good weight they are healthy. And parents don?t take the child to the pediatrician. Some say, ?Ah this child is nice and chubby and there is nothing wrong with him/her?. They aren?t aware of serious medical problems that children can develop when they reach adult age. And they tend to do nothing about it and then the overweight condition leads to obesity. This is a preventable problem,? he concluded.? ?

## Title: Book Review Writer?s fantasy or critic?s reality?

Book Review Writer?s fantasy or critic?s reality?
	
Buddhadasa Galappaththi (Buddhi) is a prolific writer and ?Mediyamaka Kaluwara? (darkness at noon) is his fourth short story collection, though he?s better known for his poetry and journalism. He has compiled fourteen books of poetry and poetry criticism to date.??
In ?Mediyamaka Kaluwara?, Buddhi is mainly concerned with a world of attraction and repulsion between the sexes. Out of the nine stories in the selection, only two ? the first and the fifth ? don?t fall into this category. He is able to tell his stories using word economy, with no superfluous detail. But, when it comes to making sense out of what the author is trying to say, I feel troubled, and that is because some of these stories have characters in situations alien to what I know from my cultural conditioning as a Sri Lankan.??
Call it the generation gap. The socio-cultural milieu I have known over four decades of life as an adult is conservative when it comes to most things; in matters related to sex, it is overwhelmingly so. But Buddhi?s characters experience a different reality.??
General yardstick??
I can only apply a personal angle when judging these stories because I must use the parameters of my past experiences and knowledge in this context, not someone else?s. If they differ radically from the society I live in, then problems would quickly arise. I?d say that while my views of many matters including the death penalty, the constitution, a secular state, abortion, torture and sexual relations are radically different from those held by most people I know (unless they are maintaining a fa?ade), the general parameters of my life such as my clothing, job and the company I keep tally with the general yardstick. This isn?t due to hypocrisy. Otherwise, I?d surely be in jail by now.??
?
?
?
?
I?m not saying these are contrived situations. But they stretch my credulity to the limit. In Handunagaththoth Oba Maa, his successful debut actress Imashi Wathsala is a credible character; with only two A level passes, she sees television acting as the best bet to rise above the circumstances
I?m not saying that writers and critics can only write about what they have personally experienced. If that were the case, the world of literature would be severely limited. Imagination, extrapolation and even conjecture all contribute to a piece of writing. When it comes to criticism, however, the critic develops a hypothesis which has to be supported by his own observations about some aspect of the fictional world developed by the writer. In other words, the critic?s reality must match the writer?s fantasy at some level.??
Why am I going into such lengths to establish the difference between the conventional and the unconventional? It?s because the same principles which apply to my daily existence are useful when it comes to writing a book review. One reason why we read novels and short stories is because they provide us with insights about people. Their inner worlds and conflicts are revealed to us artistically. While it might take years to gain such an insight on a friend, acquaintance or even family member, a good fiction writer can do that in a single paragraph.??
Buddhi?s characters??
Even if the story is about an exotic culture, we can still recognize common traits and identify ourselves with characters and situations. What else do we mean by universal literature? I have never been to the Ireland of James? Joyce?s Dubliners, nor to the Japan of Kenzaburo Oe, not even to the India of Premchand (it?s a different India that we experience as travellers). You can?t go to William Faulkner?s Yoknapatawpha County because it?s fictitious. But I know the people described in their stories. Unfortunately, some of Buddhi?s characters seem more alien to me because I can?t connect with their life experiences.?
?
Now, if you are reviewing science fiction, the critic?s personal knowledge of science doesn?t matter so much because science fiction is usually set in the future. No one knows the science we?ll have in 3000 AD or even 2064 AD. Therefore, the critic can only go by certain critical criteria applicable to all fiction in general ? the quality of prose, powers of description etc. There again, characterization doesn?t matter so much in science fiction. What really matters is whether the writer can make the reader (and the critic) believe that in 3000 AD people could? make themselves invisible under certain conditions etc.??
All these stories are thematically interesting, and Buddhi is breaking new ground with that last story. But his treatment of these characters and situations leaves me wondering if Buddhi the short story writer has done an injustice to Buddhi the poet
But, when it comes to stories about our times and people like us, things are different. In any kind of fiction, credibility matters. Do we know these people and can we believe them? In the second story of Buddhi?s collection ?Rathriya Digama Digai? (the night is very long) Kasun Wickremasinghe is a young executive, married but with a mistress. It?s a story about all the anxieties which marital infidelity brings, with fears of being found out.??
In the third story, ?Prema Thrikonaya? (Love Triangle), Wimalasiri is a young three wheeler driver who already has two mistresses and acquires a third by the story?s end, with tragic results for himself. In the fourth, titled ?May Palu Seethala Reyai? (In This Cold and Lonely Night), Maheshika is a young university undergraduate who sings in a karaoke club to supplement her meager income. She meets Milinda Jayasekara, a middle aged businessman who tells her that she bears an uncanny resemblance to his late wife. In story no. 6, Yasodhage Katha Wasthuwa (Yasodha?s story), Wimalajeewa is an older journalist who marries Yasodha, a much younger lottery seller whose ex-husband was an abusive man.??
In the seventh story ?Handunagaththoth Oba Maa,? (If only you knew me), Imashi Wathsala is a young teledrama actress who garners her producer?s help to win the most popular actress of the year contest. In ?Sudu Putha Yannama Gihin? (Sudu Putha?s gone forever), Aravinda Weerasekara is a young journalist who, while doing an investigative story about a prostitution ring, recognizes his own mother working as a hostess in a karaoke bar. In ?Samugeneema? (Farewell), university student Achala rejects her oversexed boyfriend and enters into a lesbian relationship with fellow student Pabasara only to feel hurt when the latter falls for a businessman.?
?
Breaking new ground??
All these stories are thematically interesting, and Buddhi is breaking new ground with that last story. But his treatment of these characters and situations leaves me wondering if Buddhi the short story writer has done an injustice to Buddhi the poet.??
I?m not questioning the credibility of his characters and situations. But they do make me feel like a fish out of water. If we take the character of Maheshika, the young undergraduate from an impoverished family in Ratnapura, she accepts a visiting card from Milinda at the karaoke club where she sings with a calypso band. The next day, she takes the initiative and calls him, and agrees to go with him to his holiday resort. There, he tells her about the tragedy of his life ? losing his wife, who looks like Maheshika, to cancer. She realizes he?s telling the truth when she sees his late wife?s photo in his room. They part as friends, and he promises to call her again. We are left wondering: what are they going to talk about???
I?m not saying these are contrived situations. But they stretch my credulity to the limit. In Handunagaththoth Oba Maa, his successful debut actress Imashi Wathsala is a credible character; with only two A level passes, she sees television acting as the best bet to rise above the circumstances
Trouble for the critic??
It?s a charming story. But I can?t fit Maheshika in with the female undergraduates I?ve met. It may be that I?ve led a sheltered life, or that my experiences in life are strictly limited. But this is where, as a critic, I have troubled evaluating Buddhi?s story, and the same problem recurs when it comes to many of the other stories in this collection. Going back to his university student, she meets this older businessman at a karaoke club, accepts his visiting card, calls him on her own and agrees to travel with him in his car to his holiday resort. In short, this is a thoroughly modern young woman. None of the female university students I?ve met can fit that description. Therefore, she must be exceptional, but the story doesn?t tell us that. We are simply left wondering.?
?
I?m not saying these are contrived situations. But they stretch my credulity to the limit. In Handunagaththoth Oba Maa, his successful debut actress Imashi Wathsala is a credible character; with only two A level passes, she sees television acting as the best bet to rise above the circumstances. She doesn?t hesitate to accept her producer?s clandestine help to become the most popular teledrama actress of the year. But at what price? When invited to the spacious restroom which adjoins his office, she expects a seduction in return for his favour. Instead, he turns out to be a noble character who merely kisses her and sets her free. He?s a family man but yearns for some intimacy.??
I can believe that there are noble teledrama producers. Not all of them have to be Harvey Weinsteins. But he could have proved his quality by not inviting her into his rest room in the first place.??
Decent characters fill his stories. Milinda is one. The womanising three wheeler driver is decent enough to return the purse left behind by a passenger in a hurry. Udayanga Nanayakkara, the teledrama producer, too, is a decent man. Every writer has his central theme and personal universe. Buddhi?s outlook is positive in all these stories barring ?Biyakaru Rathriya?, which is about a make up artist who takes a great risk during a time of political kidnappings and murder, and pays the ultimate price, and ?Samuganeema,? which is about a young woman?s search of? love which ends in sexual deviation and disappointment.?
Many of these stories have happy endings. I have nothing against that, and even Pushkin has used them to great effect. The problem is with the overall ambiance of these stories. Perhaps one should bear in mind that famous quote from Tolstoi?s Anna Karenina: ?All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.??
?
In the same way, when characters and situations become predictable, there is a loss of dramatic impact. Then again, what Buddhi describes is a sexually liberal world. It may actually exist, but I have trouble understanding it because the world I know around me is far?more conservative.?
The writer may well counter that it?s my problem, not his. But there are other problems regarding these stories. The textures described?
are glossy.?
He touches upon deep-rooted problems of poverty such as the lottery seller?s daily struggle to sell enough tickets to eat. But we are constantly carried to glossy textures. You can?t escape the soft lighting of karaoke clubs and the smell of perfume and attractive women in bath robes with water still dripping down their bodies.??
No middle ground
It is entertaining. It can even make for compelling reading. But that?s a dangerous word when applied to literature. Good literature shouldn?t try to be entertaining in the same sense that television can be. Mature writers, while they entertain, present us with problems areas too, in their writing. One might think it?s easy to make literature out of descriptions of good living and beautiful people. But it?s very hard. Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald are among the handful who succeeded.??
The other problem is Buddhi?s descriptions of sex. I certainly am no prude (though I?m usually surrounded by them) but if the writer is aspiring to the level of literature (and I can?t expect any less from Buddhi) then we need a different approach. Otherwise, sex sounds just like sex, cheapening the entire effort. If we take an analogy from painting, a nude by Titian and a Playboy centerfold photograph both have lush surfaces. But they are worlds apart in terms of?artistic achievement.?
Describing sex with words is just as tricky as painting or photographing a female nude. You have either art or junk, and there is no middle ground.??
Many of these stories have happy endings. I have nothing against that, and even Pushkin has used them to great effect.? Perhaps one should bear in mind that famous quote from Tolstoi?s Anna Karenina: ?All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.???
I hope this criticism will be taken in good faith. I don?t want to brand these stories as commercial writing, because all writing is more or less commercial in that writers aspire to get published and make a living. But those ?more or less? are the operative words here. If Anton Chekhov was writing today, one can imagine him writing to hundreds of publishers and finally settling for self-publication or e-books.?
The same might happen to Hemingway?s short stories, because they have no gloss and nothing much seems to happen in them.??
That?s why modern writers bring in more texture, some of it glossy. William Boyd is a good example of that kind of writing. Lasting value is another matter. Trying to decide which writer?s which book will last is beyond any critic, or indeed, any writer. One can only do one?s best and hope for the best.??
This is where I expect more from a writer like Buddhi.??

Education ?aids? combat this deadly disease
	
Themed ?Right to Health?, the World AIDS Day falls today and the World Health Organization is sending a strong message across borders, advocating for the rights of the 36.7 million people living and affected with HIV/AIDS and their right to enjoy universal health coverage. Sri Lanka being a very low prevalence country for HIV and AIDS, nevertheless has an equal responsible role to play in this regard. Speaking to Health Capsule, Director of National STD/AIDS Control Programme, Sri Lanka, Dr. Sisira Liyanage explained why it?s important to bring this rate of low prevalence to the point of elimination while stressing on the health risks involved with contracting HIV/AIDS.? ?
According to Dr. Liyanage, Sri Lanka in addition to being a low prevalence country, also has a 0.1% prevalence rate for HIV/AIDS. He said that plans were afoot to test more than two million people. This is to detect if they are diagnosed with the disease this year. He also noted that people living with the HIV disease were already being provided with the antiretroviral treatment. ?We are doing this with the assistance of the Government and patients are receiving the antiretroviral treatment free of charge? he said.? ?
?
Mode of HIV/AIDS transmission
According to Dr. Liyanage, the HIV transmission occurs mainly due to unsafe sex. Especially MSM (Men who have sex with men/homosexual men) who practise unsafe sexual intercourse, without the use of a condom, are prone to HIV. ?Only 56% are using condoms among MSM, but female sex workers also can be categorized as a risk group who are vulnerable to contract the disease. However, it should be noted that 93% of the female sex workers are using condoms compared to their male counterparts.? ?
Throughout the past five years we haven?t witnessed an increase in HIV cases among females, but among the males, this rate is increasing due to their homosexual behaviour.We have now identified the cause for HIV/ AIDS transmission and have managed to bring the transmission of the disease through blood from mother to child under control. If we detect pregnant mothers with HIV, early, we can give them treatment and stop the disease from being transmitted to the child,? he said.? ?
He stated that in 2016, nearly 44, 000 pregnant mothers had been tested for HIV and no baby was born with the disease. According to Dr. Liyanage, there had been sixteen deliveries by HIV contracted mothers last year, but all the babies have been tested HIV negative. ?We have already taken the initiative to eliminate the risk of mother to child transmission of HIV. On the other hand, blood transmission through needles aren?t very common in Sri Lanka. Such cases haven?t been reported for the past five years. There is potential to contract the disease if unsterilised cylinders and needles are shared among individuals. Very often such cases are reported among drug addicts who inject themselves with drugs such as heroine. These people share the same needles, thereby contracting the disease through an infected person? Dr. Liyanage added.? ?
?
How HIV and AIDS weaken the immune system
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a RNA virus that multiplies after entering the human body. The virus attacks a type of white blood cell known as Lymphocytes. According to Dr. Liyanage, the type of Lymphocytes thus attacked are known as CD4 cells. He said that the virus multiplies within these cells, thereby gradually destroying the patient?s immune system.? ?
?An individual infected with the disease will be recognized as a HIV positive patient. When patients diagnosed with HIV are left untreated for years, they develop AIDS at a later stage in life perhaps after a period of ten to fifteen years approximately. Also known as the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, AIDS affects the immune system permanently.? ?
If left untreated even at this stage, it will gradually start suppressing the immune system further. This will also pose the risk of being infected by germs which aren?t simply limited to the pathological varieties of germs. These germs can further multiply within the body and make an individual vulnerable to diseases due to the low immunity level? Dr. Liyanage warned. AIDS patients would be prone to develop weight loss, continuous fever, pneumonia, tuberculosis, cancer and many other diseases. Since a collection of diseases may affect the health and deteriorate the immunity of a patient, in the overall the disease is commonly known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Virus, he explained.??
?If we can detect such people at an early stage we can treat them and prevent them from transmitting HIV to others. Also, the viral concentration in the blood can be remarkably reduced through antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, it?s very important to identify patients diagnosed with the disease at an early stage,? he said.?
?
?
Eliminating the disease by 2025
Stating that UNAIDS plans to initiate a programme where a fast tracking initiative would be adopted in future to eliminate AIDS prevalence in the country, Dr. Liyanage informed that this fast tracking programme is known as 90-90-90. Explaining the programme further, he said that the initiative would help eliminate the risk of new cases of HIV/AIDS being reported in Sri Lanka by 2025.? ?
?For instance, if the estimated number of patients in Sri Lanka is 4, 000 we have to identify ninety percent of this population who are diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. We should administer antiretroviral treatment to a ninety percent from the ninety percent of patients thus identified. Our aim for the third ninety percent who have received antiretroviral treatment is to ensure that they contain a low concentration of the virus. When tested for HIV, these patients should be undetectable. Our aim is to eliminate the risk of AIDS by 2025, meaning that there shouldn?t be any opportunity created for an individual to be newly affected by the disease. We have to conduct more awareness programmes, more tests to detect patients suffering from the disease and work diligently within the next few years in order to achieve this goal,? Dr. Liyanage added.? ?
?Since unsafe sex is the main risk factor leading to the contraction of HIV, it is important to raise sufficient awareness among these vulnerable groups about the need to practise safe sex. We are already promoting various health education programmes and distributing leaflets. We also distribute free condoms and encourage people to visit the clinic to get themselves tested for HIV. We do this together with the help of non governmental organizations and the community. In the event an individual is tested HIV positive, we give them the necessary treatment to help control the disease. These are very important preventive measures that have to be carried out within a community,? he concluded.? ?

RDA Deputy Director (Southern), Mr. R.A.D. Kahatapitiya told Daily Mirror that several roads heading towards the Southern Expressway interchanges from Welipenna to Aluthgama and Kokmaduwa to Kananke were also flooded.
?No issues have been reported along the Southern Expressway up to now,? he said.
However, the RDA warned the drivers using the Southern Expressway to reduce speed to below 60 kmph, especially at places where there was a collection of water, thereby making it difficult to drive through. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

DAILY MAIL, 30 November, 2017 -? ?A breakthrough on the Brexit stand-off over the Irish border appeared closer today after new proposals based on fresh devolution to Belfast emerged.??
Under the plan the Northern Ireland Executive would be given sweeping authority to keep laws in the province close to the EU single market rules.??
The set up would allow Northern Ireland to leave the customs union with the rest of Britain but still operate different rules on cross-border trade to the mainland UK.If it went ahead, it could balance demands from Dublin for Northern Ireland to stay on EU customs terms and London?s desire to quit the single market and customs union.? ?

Meelad un-Nabi falls today
	
The Holy Prophet Muhammad was born in the Hashemite branch of the tribe of Quraysh in the city of Mecca on the Twelfth day of Rabi ul ?Awwal in the year 570 A.D. He passed away at the age of 63 years in Medina.
Prophet MohammAd?s early life
There are mixed beliefs on how one observes the Prophet?s birthday. Some people see the birthday as an event worthy of praise. Others view the celebrations of birthday as contrary to Islamic Law. Both sides cite the Hadiths (narrations originating from the words and deeds of the Holy Prophet) and events from the Prophet?s life to support their views. Meelad is celebrated with large street parades in some countries. Homes and mosques are also decorated. Some people donate food and other goods for charity on or around this day. Others listen to Quranic verses read by children and poems about events that occurred in Prophet Mohammad?s life.
However, many Muslims also do not participate in celebrations, instead they mark the occasion by spending time to read the Holy Quran. Some scholars said that the Prophet was born on a Monday and see fasting as another way to celebrate his birth.
Social system that prevailed during the time of Prophet?s birth
It was the worst of times. The base for a civilized society was shattered because of polytheism and idolatry ? the worship of idols. Earlier civilizations in Greece, India, China and Egypt were on the verge of collapse. Rulers were despotic and acted as the representatives of God and sometimes posed as God himself.? Worst of all, Capital punishment was imposed at the whims and fancies of the rulers. Rulers themselves were jurors and judges. Feudalism was the social system in which the vassal held land in exchange for allegiance and service to land owners.
Social revolution of Holy Prophet Muhammad
It was during such a dark age that the Unique One, Allah with benevolence and loving kindness to all the people sent Prophet Muhammad as his messenger to bring about a social revolution. In such a society the task before the Holy Prophet of Islam was arduous and was full of difficulties needing a lot of effort. However, the Prophet? came forward again single handed. He was successful in his endeavour and his achievements were unique and marvellous. He played the pivotal role to bring about a social revival based on the teachings of the Unique One, Allah with benevolence and loving kindness to all the people in the society. He took the lead to find the truth under the teachings of Almighty Allah. He achieved this end through the door of freedom. His course was so powerful that the Roman Empire was shattered and emperor surrendered to him.
How writers saw the greatness of the Prophet?s achievements
A writer named Schimmel in his book titled ?And Muhammad is His messenger? states ?It seems that the tendency to celebrate the memory of Muhammad?s birthday on a larger and more festive scale emerged first in Egypt during the Famid Era. This is logical for Fatimids? claim to be the prophet?s descendents through his daughter, Fatima. The Egyptian historian Magrizi basing his account on Famid sources stated ? It was apparently an occasion in which mainly scholars and religious institutions participated. They listened to sermons and sweets, particularly honey were distributed among the prophet?s favorites. The poor received them.

Not practical to import electric vehicles with 100kw-150kw capacity: EVCSL
	
While thanking Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera for the measures that he taken to improve the electric vehicle usage in Sri Lanka in 2018, the Electric Vehicle Club Sri Lanka (EVCSL) yesterday said that it would not be practical to import electric vehicles with motor capacity ranging from100kw-150kw.
While addressing the media briefing yesterday EVCSL Co-founder and Interim Committee Member Mahisanka Abeywickrama said it was also on a plan of removing all fuel vehicles from 2014, imposing the carbon tax, proposal to install electric vehicle chargers, reduction of taxation for buses and trains.
During the media briefing, he pointed out imposing higher tax percentage for electric vehicles over 100Kw as the first issue to not being it practical.
He also said the taxes of electric vehicles are greater than hybrid vehicles if compared within same class. Therefore, we propose the Government to expand the range defined for middle class vehicles to < 50 to 150 < = none of luxury cars falling in to this category. Luxury and Sport cars like Tesla have motors above 200Kw, he said.
Motor / Engine Capacity
			Taxes of Electric Vehicles
			Taxes of Petrol Hybrid
		50kW / 600cc
			Rs. 375,000
			Rs. 750,000
		100kW / 1000cc
			Rs. 1,250,000
			Rs. 1,250,000
		110kW / 1300cc
			Rs. 2,525,000
			Rs. 2,600,000
		130kW / 1300cc
			Rs. 3,250,000
			Rs. 2,600,000
		150kW / 1500cc
			Rs. 3,750,000
			Rs. 3,750,000
		?The decision to not to give tax relives for used vehicles, is not practical. Main reason is, brand new vehicles are still not imported directly into the country. Second reason is that the efficiency of the car will remain thought out years when compared with hybrids and petrol cars,? Mr. Abeywickrama said.
?When considering the batteries, they are considered as the main component of an electric vehicle. When a new battery is replaced, the old battery could be used for home solar systems for another five years. After that period there is a process of re-exporting and recycling and even batteries of hybrid cars follow the same practice. If used electric batteries are dumped to the environment without proper recycling or disposal process, it causes pollution. There are many steps the government can take to properly collect and re-export the used batteries without restricting the importation of electric vehicles,? he said.
Mr. Abeywickrama said even though brand new electric vehicles were not sold in Sri Lanka at this point, it would start during next year. And there was a possibility of their prices escalating. Furthermore, the European countries give special grants and other relief when purchasing an electric vehicle. As a result, their prices decrease drastically and by importing those used vehicles to our country will also benefit from those grants in an indirect way.
Accordingly, the EVCSL proposed that they would appreciate if the government could allow to import electric vehicles which are at least two years older. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Police also recovered an elephant calf which had been roped to a tree in Kataragama,? he said.
The Minister said the decision to handover the investigations to the CID was taken after considering all deaths of tuskers and elephants because he wanted to expedite the investigations and identify if there is any organization or network behind those elephants deaths and tuskers racket and take them into the custody soon.

Saving skin from workout effects
	
?
Activities such as walking, jogging and other workouts in the mornings and in the evenings have become part of the daily routines of many. Exposure to the sun and sweating are therefore unavoidable. Sweating for an extended period while you exercise clad in tight attire, made of artificial material, can have negative effects on your skin. Caring for the largest organ in the human body needs dedication and understanding. In order to benefit workout enthusiasts, we spoke to Dr. Indhira Kahawita, a Consultant Dermatologist at Base hospital, Homagama, to gain more insight into the common skin care problems experienced by many.? ?
?Sunburn?
?After 8 am in the morning and some hours during the evening it?s impossible to avoid the sun, specially if you indulge in outdoor activities. Even if wearing less clothes is considered more convenient during workouts, doctors advice people to use clothing that shields the body from harmful sunlight while exercising outdoors. Sunscreens are a must if you are working out in the sun, otherwise you will get sunburned. If sunspots appear in the upper arms it is advisable to use sunscreen.
Sunburn are minimized either by covering the body with clothes or using a sunscreen ( SPF above 30). Applying a thick layer of sunscreen is necessary to protect your skin from sunburn. Apply sun screen every two hours if you have to stay out in the sun for too long. But usually no one uses sunscreen, the proper way, like cricketers do,? Dr. Kahawita said.??
?
Sweating
?Excess sweat remaining on the skin for an extended time can cause fungal infections and other problems like acne. Sweating can be controlled by using cotton clothing, which absorbs excess sweat. Nearly all fashionable clothing worn during workouts are made of nylon and other materials. This does not help absorb the sweat like cotton materials. Clothes soaked with sweat can create a heaven for bacteria and germs, therefore wearing the same suit daily might invite trouble. Applying foot powder before wearing shoes can help to absorb the moisture collecting between the toes. An antifungal powder is ideal for diabetic patients. The powder must be used before wearing the shoe. Drying the shoes in the sun for a minimum of two hours after use helps to maintain sanity,? Dr. Kahawita explained.? ?
?
Using the right pair
Dr. Kahawita said that she had met some middle-aged ladies who preferred to exercise barefoot. ?Usually slippers can?t offer the support that sports shoes do. Even the brisk walk can do unknown damage to the toes if shoes aren?t worn. Wearing tightly fitting shoes will cause darkened patches on the skin. Individuals who wish to workout without shoes should use a jogging path for walking if they chose to train barefoot.? she noted.? ?
?
Skin infections
?The warm and moist environment within gyms creates a suitable atmosphere for a number of microbes to exist. These microbes can worsen your skin infections, therefore it?s advisable to keep any wounds or scars treated with medicine and fully covered.? Dr. Kahawita said.??
?
Chafing?
?Regular gym goers and workout enthusiasts love to show off their figure, wearing body-hugging clothes in spite of physical uneasiness. Tight clothing can create deep marks on your skin, especially on shoulders, upper arms, waist and wherever it is extra tight. Therefore, the best option is to wear more comfortable clothing while exercising.? she pointed.

Some (more) cuts on 1956
	
The late Tissa Abeysekara, in an essay on Lester James Peries, candidly noted that the cultural renaissance which swept over our film industry, after 1956, was never dependent on the State. He wrote this as a response to an observation by Ashis Nandy that for a revolution in the cinema to unfold itself more properly, the filmmaker as such had to look to the Government of the day for moral and financial support. The problem with this assumption is that it leaves out the stark, ubiquitous fact that no Government, in any part of the world, will get involved with a country?s cultural sphere unless and until that cultural sphere is turned into a vassal of the dominant ideology of that particular country. 1956 was a process that traces its origins to Anagarika Dharmapala, and it found its roots, for an intermittent period, with S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. But those roots were never properly nourished. They couldn?t be.??
What happened in Sri Lanka was that we confused the destruction of any? structure, elitist or otherwise, for a cultural renaissance
And why? Because, regardless of the time or place, the cultural doesn?t belong to the political, though it is also never completely independent of the political either. The latter is driven by expedience, by the need to capture rhetoric and transform it into policy and action. When these two seemingly incongruous fields of human enterprise get together, there can be no reconciliation, no proper bond between them, until the cultural is made to follow its own independent course and the political is brought in to help it follow that course, from the sidelines. As Gunadasa Amarasekara rightly notes in Anagarika Dharmapala Marxwadiyekda, what began as a flowering of our innate cultural and social sensibilities was evicted and virtually castrated by political hacks. 1956 was not opposed to English, nor was it romantically inclined towards the past. Those who thought it was, and who voted for their leaders in the hopes of dislodging the elite through it, were doomed to commit hara-kiri, because (as Regi Siriwardena frequently observed) 1956 didn?t represent the dislodgment of the elite, rather the substitution of a more insidious form of class elitism for that which had existed until then. The discrepancy the multitude and the few intensified in a more subtle, less discernible form. I firmly believe that we are still paying the price for our sins.?
The single best process (political or otherwise) inaugurated after independence was free education, because despite the problems and the shortcomings that would stunt it over the decades, it helped to push the people to embrace that modernity
?
In search? of our roots?
The revolution, of course, had to start from somewhere. That somewhere was not the Buddhist Renaissance which both Colonel Olcott and Dharmapala inaugurated right before they parted ways. That somewhere was not the search for the hela basa that Munidasa Cumaratunga launched, successfully, until it spawned a veritable horde of poets, writers, and linguists ranging from Wimal Balagalle (who turned 93 last Friday) to Siri Gunasinghe (barring Gunadasa Amarasekara, the last of the bilingual literati, who died several months back). It began instead as an independent, autonomous search for our roots that we have been hankering after ever since the West, and even the East, began invading us. It?s convenient to contend that there is a global conspiracy against the Sinhalese and the Buddhists, but what is convenient isn?t necessary what is true. The truth, therefore, is more complex, more multifarious.??
This assault on our civilisation took on three broad fronts; against the faith, the language, and the culture. The latter was more or less a sum-total of the former two, but it incorporated many other elements as well. History and heritage, let?s not forget, are never exclusively predicated on the clergy or the wielders of the mother tongue, though both form an integral part of any civilisation. Consequently, the local assault against the foreign assault congealed into those three fronts. It is my contention that any attempt at a Buddhist Renaissance was distorted by the Theosophists. It is also my contention that the many attempts of Munidasa Cumaratunga to resuscitate our language, the hela basa that had been castrated by Sanskrit impurities, were stalled by what Tissa Abeysekara once referred to as the pothe guras; the academics and the intellectuals who were opposed to, inter alia, the experiments that Sunil Shantha was indulging in and the attempts made by the likes of Prof. Balagalle to take the Sinhala language to the 20th century through Ferdinand de Saussure. The cultural sphere ? comprising poets who borrowed, but also strayed from our conventional metrical forms as well as novelists who propagated religious tracts through narrative fiction (Piyadasa Sirisena?s early works come to mind here) ? was at its inception politically zealous. When that political zeal found its equivalent in the political sphere with Bandaranaike, the cultural sphere was, for the time being, abandoned.??
Sirisena in Thun Man Handiya, Ranjith in Charitha Thunak, and the ultimate symbol, for me, of the failure of the post-1956 youth to realise their aspirations, Sena in Akkara Paha
Mother tongue?
The Sinhala language didn?t evolve after the 19th century. With the diminishment of a language comes the diminishment of an entire collective. Three centuries of foreign domination, a great many preceding centuries of internal strife, had virtually laid the mawbasa to rest. Our schools and universities lacked proper curricula for own mother tongue, and had devoted considerable space to Sanskrit and Pali. The evolution of a culture, inclusive of language that is, cannot transpire unless it is connected to the outside world. The problem was that both the few who had power and the many who didn?t were lethargic and indifferent to this problem; the former because they didn?t speak, and indeed looked down on, the Sinhala language; and the latter because they were unmoored from modernity. The single best process (political or otherwise) inaugurated after independence was free education, because despite the problems and the shortcomings that would stunt it over the decades, it helped to push the people to embrace that modernity. Free education had been preceded by the emancipation of our intellectuals: the likes of Professor Senarath Paranavithana and Wimal Balagalle were already giants in their fields when the Kannangara Proposals were being implemented.??
It began instead as an independent, autonomous search for our roots that we have been hankering after ever since the West, and even the East, began invading us
What 1956 lacked was a comparable generation of intellectuals and academics who were conversant with both the East and the West. 1956 wouldn?t have happened if that generation didn?t exist beforehand, if they hadn?t been fermented by a largely elitist education they themselves repudiated, rightly, later on. I am aware of the need to do away with elitist structures once a revolution, cultural or political, is ongoing, but ***what happened in Sri Lanka was that we confused the destruction of any structure, elitist or otherwise, for a cultural renaissance. Consequently, the rift between swabasha and non-swabasha, which in turn gave way to a three-pronged rift between the elites, the multitude who wielded the vernacular and refused to join the elites, and the multitude who acceded to them, was so overwhelming that what we got in the end was a social discrepancy between those who could speak English and those who could not. The earlier class hierarchies had ostensibly vanished, but their spirit endured.??
Stricken with envy?
The outcome of all this wasn?t a cultural renaissance. The outcome was an aberration; a culture of envy, on the part of those who wished to join the privileged. The writers and the poets who emerged after 1956 ? Mahagama Sekera (Thun Man Handiya), K. Jayatilleke (Charitha Thunak), Madawala S. Ratnayake (Akkara Paha), to name a few ? wrote of the new swabasha-wielding folk, who clamoured and hankered after social upliftment: Sirisena in Thun Man Handiya, Ranjith in Charitha Thunak, and the ultimate symbol, for me, of the failure of the post-1956 youth to realise their aspirations, Sena in Akkara Paha. While not all these characters and their real-life counterparts rebelled against their pasts to join the elite, they were more or less stricken with envy, with sadness, with poignant imaginings of what they would have been if they were born to privilege. It was an insane reversal of fortune, and our novelists, who were deeply connected with the ethos that made 1956 possible, more so than our filmmakers, punctured the idealism that year conceived with the harsh reality it later gave birth to. Our filmmakers were more rebellious, more brutal, in that respect, from Dharmasena Pathiraja, who came from roughly the same milieu which Wimal Balagalle had come from, to Dharmasiri Bandaranayake, our first political director and playwright who hailed completely from the generation of 1956.??
There?s an interesting passage in The Play is the Thing where Henry Jayasena recounts a childhood encounter with Ananda Rajakaruna. Apparently Jayasena?s school had organised a literary contest at Kalutara at which speakers would condemn English and promote the vernacular. Rajakaruna, whose poems were considered a rallying point for nationalist activists, was a special guest. After the event was done, when he and Jayasena were talking with each other, they had heard the organisers of that same anti-English meeting speak in English, and eloquently. Jayasena tells us that Rajakaruna had got so angry that he stormed in and shouted, ?You preach one thing and do another. You are what I would call total hypocrites.? For good measure, perhaps, he added, ?What is wrong with our village children learning English? Isn?t it because of your superiority with your English that you are able to hold meetings of this nature and that people listen to you? It would have been much more honest if you told them the truth: that your knowledge of English is a big advantage!???
Rajakaruna had a point there. Not hard to see what it was. And what it continues to be.??

Special relationship in meltdown as May hits back at Trump
	
?
Theresa May hit back at Donald Trump by insisting she is tackling terrorism today as an extraordinary spat threatened to blow the Special Relationship apart. Downing Street dismissed a jibe from the US president as the two leaders crossed swords over his retweets of anti-Muslim videos posted by a far-right group.?
Mrs May has branded Mr Trump?s decision to share the material ?wrong?, but he lashed out at her last night demanding she focus on ?Islamic terrorism taking place in the UK?.
Mr Trump?s tweets drew cold fury from across the political spectrum in the UK, with fresh calls for his State Visit invite - extended by Mrs May on behalf of the Queen in January - to be withdrawn.Lib Dem leader Vince Cable branded Mr Trump an ?evil racist?, while shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said he was trying to ?humiliate and belittle? the PM.
Labour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the comments will be seen as a ?betrayal? of the special relationship and called for his visit to be cancelled.
Cabinet ministers joined the condemnation with Communities Secretary Sajid Javid saying the president had endorsed a ?vile, hate-filled racist organisation?. Home Secretary Amber Rudd gave a clear hint that the state visit will not happen soon, saying ?arrangements have yet to be made?, and suggested it was time Mr Trump gave up Twitter.

Spreading the message to AIDS patients: You can live with the ?enemy? within
	
Today is World AIDS Day. Millions die of AIDS every year in many parts of the world. According to the World Health Organisation, HIV continues to be a major global public health issue and has so far claimed more than 34 million lives.?
?Definition?
The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) causes an infection that can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS, the Director of National STD/AIDS Control Programme Dr. Sisira Liyanage said. AIDS results in a progressive failure of the immune system leading to potentially fatal infections and cancers. The last stage of HIV infection is AIDS.? ?
?But having HIV doesn?t mean you have AIDS. With treatment, many people with HIV are able to live long and active lives,? he said.??
?
Is there a cure ???
There?s still no cure for HIV. But, once the virus is identified, the patient could start taking treatment, so that the virus can be made undetectable, Dr. Liyanage said.?
?He said that effective treatment is provided by the clinics operated across the country by National STD/AIDS Control Programme. The treatment supports in reducing and weakening the HIV virus and it automatically strengthens the immune system.??
According to Dr. Liyanage, the majority of HIV patients belong to the age group between 25-45. He said that there is also HIV prevalence among the age groups between 15 and 25.??
He said that more than 1.1 million testing sessions have been carried out by the Health Ministry and it (Ministry) hopes to increase the number of testing sessions in 2018.??
Continual treatment??
He urged patients to continue with the treatment and not be influenced by misconceptions.??
?Some people stop treatment and start Ayurveda treatment on the assumption that the virus would be cured completely. It is a well-known fact that there is no cure for this disease, but only long-term care and medicine. Some people come to us after the virus worsens due to the consumption of various so-called medicines,? he said.??
Speaking about the relationship between prostitution and spread of HIV, Dr. Liyanage said that 93% of sex workers in Sri Lanka are using protective methods (condoms). He said that if someone says HIV can be eradicated by banning prostitution, it is nothing but a distant dream.? ?
?All what should be done is to enhance the education of people regarding sexual health and sexual responsibility,? he said.??
Discrimination of patients?a huge problem
Sri Lanka is a country that boasts of cultures and traditions. Despite having been recognized as the country with the best health service in South Asian region, HIV/AIDS is still a taboo topic in the Sri Lankan society.? ?A recent example for this kind of practice is the incident where a boy who was marginalized by the local community on the assumption that he was infected with HIV because there was speculation that his father had died of HIV/AIDS.??
The boy had been debarred from entering school. However, in May 2016, a landmark ruling was given by the Supreme Court prohibiting HIV discrimination in an educational setting following a fundamental human rights violation petition filed by the boy?s mother.? ?Patients living with the virus claim that the social discrimination they have to face is a major concern.?
?
Media and Advocacy Officer of ?Equal Grounds? organization Sriyal Nilanka said continuing with discrimination and unfriendly attitudes towards HIV/AIDS patients in the society prevents open discussion and creating awareness on the subject among the general public.??
He also said that these attitudes make people reluctant to get tested and prevent patients from obtaining further treatment provided by public health care.??
More?than 450 people have died of HIV/AIDS in Sri Lanka since 1989
?
?HIV patients face embarrassment when they visit clinics. Many patients have told us that medical staff poses countless questions inquiring into sensitive personal details, disregarding privacy. They pose such questions with the intention of using the answers for research and similar matters. But, patients don?t like to share information that?s very personal. Sharing such information isn?t compulsory in the relationship patients have with the doctors who treat them. This kind of practice discourages patients from getting tested and obtaining treatment. Some doctors also don?t treat patients kindly. Doctors should understand how mentally unstable most HIV/AIDS patients are. They are already battling self-stigma. Medical staff has a responsibility towards showing humanity to such patients,? he said.??
Sriyal said that as people are afraid of being condemned and marginalized by the society, measures should be taken to stop discrimination at all levels.??
He said that a country where such practices aren?t prevented will never achieve an HIV/AIDS free certificate.? ?
?There is a lot of work to be done in our society in order to change the lens through which the people look at HIV/AIDS patients. People?s attitudes should be changed,? he remarked.??
There are around?4100?people in the country living with HIV
Meanwhile, UNAIDS? Right to Health Report gives voice to the communities most affected by HIV?including people living with HIV, sex workers, people who use drugs, gay men and other men who have sex with men and young people?on what ?the right to health? means.? ?In the lead-up to World AIDS Day on 1 December, UNAIDS has launched this year?s World AIDS Day campaign. The campaign, My Health, My Right, focuses on the right to health and explores the challenges people in the world face in exercising their rights.??
?All people, regardless of their age, gender, where they reside or who they love, have the right to health,? said Michel Sidib?, Executive Director of UNAIDS. ?No matter what their health needs are, everyone requires health solutions that are available and accessible, free from discrimination and of good quality,? said Sidibe.? ?The campaign reminds people that the right to health is much more than access to quality health services and medicines, that it also depends on a range of important assurances including, adequate sanitation and housing, healthy working conditions, a clean environment and access to justice.?

Says?Sri Lanka?s longest living female HIV patient
?I was simply a 41-year-old mother, who in 1991, received the same news that more than 34 million people had received. I was HIV positive. I had four kids by that time. Hearing that my death was nearing was an overwhelming and scary experience. I didn?t even know what HIV was all about.? ?
?I remarried a man who worked in a shipping line after my ex-husband died. I wasn?t a sex worker. I got this virus from my second husband. I started searching for information about the virus from all possible sources. Doctors told me that I could live for only three more years. On that day in 1991, I felt like I was given a death sentence. I was so afraid of dying and of having anyone find out that I was HIV positive.??
?I told my mother, father, siblings and no one else.
?I tried several times to contact my husband who was living abroad. I wrote him ten letters for which there were no replies. I don?t know even whether he is still alive.??
?I walked into the office of National STD/AIDS Control Programme where I found the solution for all my problems. I could finally get my life on track. I met godlike doctors in the STD/AIDS Control clinic. They gave me hope. My treatments started and now the HIV virus has been brought into an undetectable level.? ?
There are more than 100?school children aged less than 15 who are HIV positive
?There is a typical belief in the society that HIV only happens to ?those people.? But, I was just a housewife who lived only with my husband. HIV doesn?t care where you are from and how you met your partner. As long as there is unsafe sex without using condoms, there is a risk for anyone.??
?People hate me because I am HIV positive. They don?t touch me because I am HIV-positive. People also think that HIV positive people like me are trying to spread the virus with hatred towards others. It is nothing but a big lie. I share these experiences because I truly care and would hate to hear of new HIV cases. I have experienced that embarrassing?
and disheartening period in my life. I don?t want someone else experience that trauma.??
?I never knew that such a virus existed. I think the Government should include HIV/AIDS education in the school syllabus because I believe if I had been better informed, I wouldn?t have been trapped in this problem.? ?
?It wasn?t an easy journey, but I have always been determined to live. Now I am the longest living HIV female patient in Sri Lanka. As a 67-year HIV survivor, it amazes me how I made uninformed choices due to lack of direction and support. To be frank with you, I just married the second husband for money and appearance. I thought my kids would have a good future if I married him. Now I regret that decision taken to remarry. What I have to tell all the parents and youth is please check the blood report of the man your son/ daughter, you are going to marry instead of the horoscope? she said.??
Does?Sri Lanka have an HIV issue??
More than 450 people have died of HIV/AIDS in Sri Lanka since 1989, the year when the island nation identified its first HIV patient. According to the statistics of the National STD/AIDS Control Programme, there are around 4100 people in the country living with HIV. Of the 4100, only around 1650 have been identified and are taking treatment. The data also reveals that there are more than 100 school children aged less than 15 who are HIV positive.? ?
During the first three quarters of 2016, 34 people have died of HIV while 191 new HIV cases have been reported in Sri Lanka. However, during the first three quarters of 2017, 26 HIV deaths have been reported while 209 new HIV cases have been reported in Sri Lanka. Statistics clearly indicate that there is an increase of new HIV cases being reported.??
Experts state that rather than holding discussions and forums on World AIDS Day, conducting a chain of strong and effective awareness programmes targeting the general public will be timely as many people are unaware that they are living with HIV.??
Dr. Sisira Liyanage said that failing to take the necessary precautions to prevent getting HIV infected can also leave people being more vulnerable to be victims. He emphasized that it?s important for anyone to get tested. He also said that there is still much misbeliefs associated with the virus.?
Unawareness of?hiv/AIDs
Lack of sex education and awareness on sexually transmitted infections and prevention among Sri Lankans, especially the youth, are other causes for the rise of HIV/AIDS cases in Sri Lanka, Sriyal Nilanka from Equal Grounds said.??
?This isn?t being talked even in the media sufficiently. Therefore, the level of education the youth has regarding these subjects is very low. It is the Government?s duty to take measures and enhance the education on reproductive health and sexually transmitted infections and their prevention,? he said.??
?Just knowing things in Health books at schools will not change behaviour and attitudes. Adolescence is a crucial period for fostering healthy attitudes and behaviours to protect people from diseases. Therefore, the youth between ages 12-24 should be educated on these subjects. Then, we can protect our future generation from being victims of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. So, sex education must be given appropriately and sufficiently keeping with age and done without further delay. There is an alarming risk that our children will fall victim to these diseases due to unawareness,? Sriyal stressed.??
In the journey towards reducing the prevalence of HIV from 0.01% to the overall goal of 0% to be achieved by 2030, increasing public awareness of the fact that HIV is treatable?
is a must
Meanwhile, Director of the National STD/AIDS Control Programme, Dr. Sisira Liyanage said that the Health Ministry plans to increase awareness programmes island wide, make people have access to condoms through a comprehensive distribution chain operated in STD clinics and operate family planning clinics, hospitals and pharmacies.??
They are already battling self-stigma. Medical staff has a responsibility towards showing humanity to such patients
?In the journey towards reducing the prevalence of HIV from 0.01% to the overall goal of 0% to be achieved by 2030, increasing public awareness of the fact that HIV is treatable is a must. We will also ensure wider use of condoms. Present day school children are exposed to the risk of being victims of HIV/AIDS. The epidemic of HIV/AIDS is now progressing at a rapid pace among the young. Their vulnerability is further heightened by the fact that awareness about the different methods of prevention was rather low. In the Sri Lankan society, most parents are reluctant to discuss this type of issues with their?
children at home. Parents must be more responsible and mindful in being comfortable with their own children to explain and teach them of what HIV and AIDS are, and what exposures and risky behaviours can potentially lead to contracting the virus,? Dr. Liyanage explained.??
He emphasized that approximately 2350 people are living with HIV/AIDS without receiving any treatment because even they don?t know that they are such patients.? ?He also said that there is another group of HIV/AIDS patients who don?t opt for treatments due to the negative attitude they sport about HIV/AIDS that there is no purpose of obtaining treatments.??
?People don?t know that there is long-term treatment. Once the virus is identified, it can be treated. The virus can be brought to an undetectable level with treatment. Educational interventions can make a significant change in people?s knowledge,??
he said.

Tourists leave as Bali volcano hit
	
?
AFP, 30 November, 2017-?
Thousands of foreign tourists were leaving Bali by plane Thursday after an airport shutdown sparked by a rumbling volcano, but some visitors were irate at not being able to get off the Indonesian island paradise sooner.? ? The alert level on Mount Agung remains at maximum. But a change in wind direction blew towering columns of ash and smoke away from the airport, prompting authorities to re-open the island?s main international gateway Wednesday afternoon.? ? That opened an eagerly awaited window for some of the 120,000 tourists stranded after the surge in volcanic activity grounded hundreds of flights, sparking travel chaos and forcing the evacuation of villagers living in the mountain?s shadow.? ?
Ash is dangerous for planes as it makes runways slippery and can be sucked into their engines.? ?
??Things are gradually getting back to normal,? said Bali airport spokesman Israwadi, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.??

Towards a dignified silver age
	
?
There are a few inevitable things in life. Ageing and death are at the foremost among them. Health Capsule last week highlighted the attitude change towards ageing in an effort to make readers embrace old age with enthusiasm, instead of being resigned about the inevitable.? ?
This week, as a continuation from last week?s article, we are discussing about the specific challenges that ageing brings and how best to overcome them and preserve the quality of life. Our resource person is Dr. Dilhar Samaraweera, Consultant Physician at the Colombo South Teaching Hospital and the President of the Sri Lanka Geriatric Association.? ?
With regard to the problems that the elderly face, the most important factor is ?frailty?, which can again be sub divided into Physical, Mental and Social frailty, explained Dr. Samaraweera.?
?
?
Overcoming Physical Frailty
?When it comes to physical frailty, most of the issues are due to the weakening of the senses with age. The most effected are hearing and vision. Deafness can be due to conduction defects from the environment to the inner ear, or due to sensory neural causes relating to the defects in the nerves.? ?
Vision naturally decreases with age due to increased viscosity of the eye lens, which hinders the near vision in tasks such as reading. In addition, conditions like cataract and glaucoma can also affect vision. Regular checkups of the vision will present an opportunity to diagnose disease conditions early and prevent complications. The use of glasses will compensate for the loss in vision.? ?
Mobility problems are another area of importance during advanced age. This can be due to various causes, including blood pressure changes causing dizziness and sense of imbalance, degenerative changes of the joints, reduced sensations in the feet, toes, the joints due to peripheral nerve dysfunction and atrophy or wasting away of muscles. These problems need special attention because the sequel increases during adult life. One of the problems is falling. These falls have a higher chance of resulting in uncommon and severely debilitating fractures due to reduced bone density. The most common areas for fractures are the hip and vertebral. Using of a proper walking stick with mobility at the sign of problems will help improve the quality of life. Such a tool will also act as a protective mechanism against possible fractures.? ?
Reduced or lack of interest in nutrition value in meals during advanced age will again be harmful. The causes for this may be varied, including personal attitude (?What nutrient for me in these final years of life!?), reduction of appetite due to lessening of the senses like the taste and smell and difficulty in chewing. Having adequate energy protein, vitamins and minerals is crucial in maintaining a healthy silver age, so the elderly should take care and have a balanced nutritious meal.? ?
It?s a common belief that the risk of developing non-communicable diseases like Diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases is more during old age. Dr. Samaraweera explained that rather than increasing the risk, diseases get accumulated with age. Each of these is a result of long term unhealthy living, which gives rise to the disease conditions after decades. So, the longer you live, the more you?ll face the consequences of the unhealthy lifestyle you led during your youth. So, each person, no matter his or her age, should be more concerned about ones? lifestyle.? ?
The elderly are also more susceptible to diseases like pneumonia and other infections, mainly due to the weakening of their immune system. Therefore, infectious diseases require urgent medical care than is needed in a younger person.? ?
Constipation is also a common complaint among the elderly. This condition can be minimized by a diet with adequate fibers, physical exercise and medication when necessary.? ?
Sexual dysfunction during old age is a problem which is often overlooked, even at the medical care profession. Inquiries should be made and the person?s quality of life should be improved through interventions.? ?
?
Understanding Mental Frailty
There is a range of mental debilitations being commoner among the older age group. Dementia, or the loss of memory resulting in reduced ability to make judgments, is one such issue. It can have a variety of underlying factors like stroke, vitamin deficiencies, Diseases like Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s, and during advanced disease, a patient may lose the ability to identify members of the family or be unable to recall his own past. This condition can be devastating to the patient and his loved ones.? ?
Delirium is another problem, where the patient?s consciousness is clouded. This is usually the reason why some elderly patients become aggressive, violent and even go as far as attacking relations.? ?
Depression is also commoner in the elderly, due to a variety of underlying causes like social reasons, feeling of isolation. Other psychotic conditions like mood disorders can also be present in the elderly.? ?
Seeking appropriate treatment at the early stages will result in correcting the defects when possible and counseling for the patient and family in other cases which can go a long way towards improving the life of the patient as well as those of the family members.? ?
?
Prevention of Social Isolation
Social problems may be a result of sedentary lifestyle, where the elderly parents who lived in a more rural area coming to live with children into a more urban setting. This will result in a change in the social contact as well as a feeling of isolation. At present families also have a lesser number of children and there is a higher rate of the young to immigrate. This will again result in the isolation of parents.? ?
Death of the spouse, leaving the other to fend for himself will also result in social isolation.? ?
Overcoming these issues will need understanding and communication. Good communication in the family and friends is the key to success in most instances. In addition, they can participate in more social activities like elderly societies, elderly day care, organize events like charity functions and concerts, which will make them a part of an active social circle. These activities will make them feel more involved and will help to get rid of the feelings of uselessness.? ?
The young generation must understand that taking care of the very old, who are debilitated, is crucial. This will enable the feeble elderers to receive optimum care including palliative care and to be comfortable during their final days.? ?
These changes, both in the attitudes and in society and medical care, set up to facilitate the elderly, is of utmost importance. This is because as Dr. Samaraweera explained, the percentage of elderly population in Sri Lanka has been rising. This rise is expected to continue. ?Today, 12.5% of our population is over sixty years of age and this number is expected to double by 2041. We have much preparations to do as a nation, to face this challenge successfully,? he said.? ?
The doctor ended the discussion recalling the theme for the first academic session of the Sri Lanka Geriatric Medicine Association, ?Towards a Silver Age with Dignity?. If the society- the young and the old- would join hands, reaching this goal wouldn?t be difficult. This will enable us to look forwards to a happy and a fulfilling silver age.? ? ?

Tribute to late DIG Lalith Gunasekera An exemplary police officer with an unblemished record
	
Retired DIG Mr. Lalith Gunasekera, a distinguished past pupil of Dharmapala Vidyalaya, Pannipitiya an exemplary Police Officer with an unblemished record and a great human being with great humane qualities passed away on 06th August 2017.? ?
Mr. Lalith Gunasekera was born in 1943 as the second son of a respectable middle class family at Kottawa. He was admitted to Dharmapala Vidyalaya in 1949, being the only English medium school in the vicinity at the time. He received his entire primary, secondary and senior secondary education at Dharmapala which equipped him with a liberal, bilingual and comprehensive education. At Dharmapala he excelled in academic pursuits, sports and other numerous extracurricular activities including cadetting. He played football for the college. He loved his School and respected his teachers. He displayed exemplary leadership qualities. He was also elevated to the rank of Senior Prefect of the College. Both as a Junior and Senior Cadet he displayed his skills and talents in gallantry and martial arts. He was always the obvious choice of the cadet masters to head the platoon as Sergeant. He brought great credit to Dharmapala when he was elevated to the position of sergeant major of the 3rd Battalion of the Ceylon Cadet Corp. His life?s ambition was to don the Police or Army Uniform. He joined the Police Force as a Sub ? Inspector of Police in 1963 at the age of 20 years. This was the turning point in his life and his career. This was the ideal job for Lalith; for he was prepared to face up to any challenge as well as to take any amount of risk. He was mentally and physically equipped to meet rough and tough situations. During the JVP insurrection in 1971 he was taken prisoner and brought to the Alawwa bridge to be shot and the body to be dumped in the river. Luckily for him the sudden appearance of an Air Force helicopter overhead enabled him to escape certain death. He served in all parts of the country. He never protested against a transfer nor did he canvass a promotion.? ?
His rise to the rank of DIG was not only rapid but also well deserved. He rose step by step from SI to IP and from then on to chief Inspector and ASP. From ASP he climbed up to SP, SSP and DIG without any hitch
His rise to the rank of DIG was not only rapid but also well deserved. He rose step by step from SI to IP and from then on to chief Inspector and ASP. From ASP he climbed up to SP, SSP and DIG without any hitch. As Director of the Kalutara Police Training school he introduced many novel training methodologies to turn out Policeman of integrity, honour, grit and determination.
?He retired from the Police Service in 2003 after 40 years of dedicated service without any blemish the crowning moment of his career was the assignment he received from the United Nations to serve the East Timor Police Force as a Senior Advisor for the restructuring and reestablishment of the Police Force of that Country.? ?
Lalith was a self made man with a great deal of self determination, self motivation and self discipline. In 1958 when Lalith was only 15 years of age, he was struck by a major calamity, namely, the untimely death of his beloved mother.?
However, he faced up to it gallantly being guided by the Buddhist teaching that ?birth in its wake brings death too? and continued with his studies while helping his father to keep the home fires burning. Unfortunately, the same chronic illness that affected his mother caused the untimely death of his brother Mahinda Gunasekera in 1999 at the age of 59 years. Today, we are gathered here to mourn the death of our distinguished friend and colleague Lalith Gunasekera whose Death has been attributed to the same cause.?
I related these episodes to vindicate Lalith from any possible wild accusation that cirrhosis of the liver is caused by excessive consumption of alcohol. On the contrary I am told that Lalith was a teetotaler. Therefore, one could surmise that what afflicted Lalith was hereditary.? ?
DIG Lalith Gunasekera was a man of principles. He always acted true to his conscience.?
His honesty and integrity were beyond reproach. His subordinates in the Police force feared him; for he would not spare them if found guilty of any misdemanour. He was forthright and uncompromising when it came to matters of discipline. The greatest quality in him was that he always stood for justice, fairplay and righteousness. If he made any wrong decision inadvertently he would be the first person to admit the mistake and rectify it?with humility.? ?
Laith?s first love was his wife, daughters, family and friends. He was fondly attached to his wife and the two daughters. He cared for them and protected them with a lot of personal sacrifice. Lalith was a self- mademan. All the material wealth the had accumulated has been bestowed to his wife and two children for their future well being.?
He also had a set of life long friends whom he adored and helped.? ? Lalith?s second love was his Alma mater i.e his old school Dharmapala Vidyalaya. His personal attachment to the school, his contemporaries at the school and the Past Pupils Association was legendary.?
He has been a live wire and a generous benefactor of the PPA, He was associated with the PPA from the day he left school. He held many top positions of the PPA with dignity and decorum. During his tenure as president of the PPA he was able to complete the construction of the college swimming pool and?get it commissioned.
?He master minded and directed the successful conducting of the Dharmapala Ranaviru Upahara Ceremony to felicitate nearly one hundred war hero?s of our school of all ranks who contributed their blood a and sweat to bring to an end the 30 year war against terrorism. He was always in the forefront of fund raising campaigns launched by the PPA. Upto the time of his passing away he held the office of vice president of Mulpelapalio (1940 ? 1960 Group) and the high position of patron of the PPA. While his passing away is an irreparable loss to his wife, two daughters, relatives and friends; it is indeed an irredeemable loss to his Alma Mater Dharmapala Vidyalaya and the PPA. May he attain the ultimate bliss of Nibbana.? ?

Water levels rising, be vigilant : DMC
	
The Disaster Management Centre requested residents in low-lying areas close to the Nilwala Ganga, Gin Ganga and Kalu Ganga areas to be vigilant and evacuate the area if necessary as the water levels in the rivers were rising and were on the verge of overflowing.
The Irrigation Department said that the water levels of Millakanda in Kalu Ganga, Baddegama in Gin Ganga and Panadugama in Nilwala River were rising. The Department also said the Panadugama area had experienced floods while a minor flood situation had occurred in Baddegama.
Meanwhile, the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) warned the public of possible landslides, slope failures, cut failures and ground subsidence especially in Palindanuwara, Bulathsinhala, Ingiriya and Agalawatta Divisional Secretariats in Kalutara District and in surrounding areas.
Also, the Meteorology Department said the hurricane style gale force winds which later developed in to a cyclone named ?OCKHI? is moving further away from the country and is located about 600km to the West of Colombo. Hence, the department is expecting its effects to the country to lessen gradually.
However, it further said that heavy rain falls of more than 100 mm could be expected in some areas in the Northern, North-Central, Uva, Southern, Western, Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces.
Temporary localized strong gusty winds of up to 50kmph could be experienced in the Western, Southern and Sabaragamuwa provinces.
Meanwhile, due to the cloudiness in the Western and Southern sea areas rough seas are expected in the deep and shallow sea areas off the Western and Southern coasts with wind speeds of up to 70 to 80kmph.
Naval and fishing communities are requested to be vigilant as wind speeds in other coastal areas are expected to increase up to 50kmph.
Officials said that seven individuals have died and eight are missing due to the prevailing weather condition. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Were Uranus, Neptune and Pluto known to ancient Indians?
	
Is Astrology a science? Part 4
?
?
Vedic Astrology has been an integral part of the Indian Vedic culture and practiced since times immemorial.
?
Discovery of three new planets
Uranus was discovered by William Herschel in 1791 with the use of the telescope.? Neptune was discovered by Johann Galle and Le Vernier in 1846 and in fact, its existence was predicted by John Couch Adams much earlier.? ?Pluto was a discovery in 1930 by astronomer Tombaugh.? It is the general belief that these distant planets were discoveries made for the first time in the history of mankind thanks to the invention of the telescope.?
?
Planets mentioned in Mahabharata
However, Indian scholars claim that there is evidence that the planets not visible to the naked eye were known to ancient Indian astronomers and that the planets mentioned in the epic poem Mahabharata (3100 BCE) as Sumeta, Syamet and Teekshana could be a reference to the three distant planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.?
The planet Sweta in the Citta Nakshatra (constellation) has been described by Mahabharata author Vyasa as being Greenish White and it has now been discovered to be the colour of Uranus; the Bluish White of the planet Syamat is found to be the colour of Neptune. Scholars also believe that the planet that Vyasa has referred to as Teekshana ?troubling? the Krittika constellation as Pluto discovered in 1930.?
?
Great revival in Astrology in India
The knowledge and practice of Vedic Astrology, targeted to only royalty and aristocracy in India had been the prerogative of the Brahmin scholars and sages until about the 2nd millennium BC and the subject had begun developing into a compact body of knowledge following the spread of Babylonian system of Astrology to the Indian sub-continent. The first centuries in the Christian era had witnessed a number of classical works like Jataka Parijata, Saravali, Sarvata Chintamani etc. written by sages like Parasara, Varahamihira, Garga, Jaimini and their followers which led to a great revival in Astrology in India. In fact, these sages had been great astronomers as well.?
?
Impact on body and mind
It is an irrefutable fact that the wise men in the ancient civilizations were led to the search for heavenly bodies and to the study of these bodies by a great desire to uncover their influence on man and his environment. In fact, sages like Parasara and Varahamihira had been great astronomers. The discovery of planets and stars led them to discover their effect on man - life on earth. These wise men? unraveled through long years of observation and research that there is an intelligent design encompassing the entire universe and that the heavenly bodies could exert an effect on both body and mind of an individual which could go so far as to make an impact on personality traits.?
?
Astronomical and Predictive components of Astrology
True, that the scientists like archeologists and anthropologists have already uncovered many secrets about our ancient civilizations. But they all agree that what they have unraveled so far about great achievements of our great ancestors is only the tip of the iceberg. The subject of Astrology is clearly made up of two main integral parts: Astronomical part and the Predictive part. We now know that the Astronomical part of Astrology is quite compatible with modern Astronomy. It is the Predictive part of Astrology or Predictive Astrology that is yet to earn the status of a science through empirical research.?

What Tithis foretell for you
	
?
Although we are now following the Gregorian calendar, our ancients both in India and Sri Lanka used the lunar calendar based on the Lunar month beginning from the New Moon to the Full Moon.? In fact, still we are using the lunar calendar for religious and astrological purposes.?
What is the Lunar month?
According to Lunar calendar, a day is called ?Tithi?. 28 days plus the New Moon day and the Full Moon day make a lunar month.?
The duration of each Tithi depends on the distance in degrees between the relative positions of the Sun and the Moon as viewed from earth. A distance of 12 degrees constitutes one Tithi.
?
Pura Pakshaya and Ava Pakshaya
When the Moon is waxing ? when the distance between the Sun and the Moon is increasing ? we call it Pura Pakshaya or Shukla Pakshaya which is the bright fortnight of the Moon.? When the relative distance between the Sun and the Moon is decreasing, we call it the Ava Pakshaya or the Krishna Pakshaya which means the dark fortnight. The 15th Tithi of the bright fortnight is called Pasalosvaka or Poornima and the 15th? Tithi of the dark fortnight is Amavaka or Amavasya.

Whiter teeth bring a brighter smile
	
?
Ever wanted that gleaming white picture perfect smile? But your teeth gradually losing its white colour may make you unable to break into that bright smile. The key in maintaining a proper white set of teeth is to follow dental and oral hygiene. But sometimes you may need extra help in achieving that perfect white teeth. That?s when you may consider approaching Teeth Whitening. But your head may be clouded with doubts and concerns regarding the whitening procedures. This week?s edition of the Health Capsule is ready to erase your doubts and answer questions regarding teeth whitening. We did this by consulting Dr. Vipula Wickramasinghe, General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Dental Association and Regional Dental Surgeon of the Colombo District. He provided a detailed explanation of the procedures, risks that may entail and maintenance that will help you better understand teeth whitening so you can make your choice. But it is important to keep in mind that teeth whitening is only done under approval and strict supervision of a dental surgeon.? ?
Dr. Wickramasinghe explained that teeth whitening is either the restoration of a tooth to its natural shade or whitening beyond the natural shade. ?Teeth whitening is purely a cosmetic type of treatment and not medicinal treatment. The patient is not really a patient,? he said.? ?
Let?s return to square one where we consider the causes that lead to the discolouration of teeth. ?Food habits such as the constant consumption of processed food and excessive drinking of alcohol can lead to discoloration of teeth. Dental and oral issues such as filling of enamel due to ageing, suffering from dry mouth (a condition where salivary glands don?t produce enough saliva to keep the mouth wet) and nerve fillings are also some causative factors. Some antibiotics, excessive intake of fluoridated water, as well as genetic factors can cause teeth to lose colour,? warned Dr. Wickramasinghe.? ?
?
Treatment? ?
Teeth whitening is not child?s play. Dr. Wickramasinghe said that before a whitening treatment is confirmed, the dental surgeon will conduct a thorough investigation of the patient?s medical and dental health history, examining the patient through checkups to ensure that the health of the patient is satisfactory to undergo whitening. Once you are approved for the treatment, the dental surgeon will go over the whitening procedures explaining every detail. The patient will also be warned of the risks that may entail during and after the whitening procedure. Once the examinations and discussions have been made followed by the consent of the patient, only then will the whitening treatment be performed by the dental surgeon.?
There are many teeth whitening techniques available. Most whitening techniques involve bleaching. ?The bleaching agents used for teeth whitening are commonly hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. The enamel of the tooth is the outer hard surface. The dentine lies beneath the enamel. It?s a hard dense bony tissue forming the bulk of the tooth. The oxidizing agent (bleach) is used to penetrate the enamel into the dentine, breaking down the stain deposits from the dentine,? explained Dr. Wickramasinghe.? ?
?
Home and office
Teeth whitening techniques are classified as office and home techniques. ?Home techniques include methods that the patient can follow at home. Whitening chewing gums, whitening toothpastes, whitening rinses and whitening strips are some methods. Whitening strips are kept on the patient?s teeth overnight with bleaching material in between. There are also custom-made teeth whitening trays where a whitening gel can be applied and worn overnight,? he explicated. He also warned that home bleaching techniques are performed strictly under advice and supervision of dental surgeon. These materials cannot be purchased over the counter.
Office bleaching treatment is performed in the dental office by the dental surgeon. ?Two trays compatible to the patient?s mouth will be inserted with a whitening gel and kept in the mouth for a given period of time for the bleaching action to be completed. The time may vary from patient to patient. It depends on the desired results and needs of the patient,? said the dental surgeon.? ?
Light accelerated bleaching is another method, which follows the same procedure as mentioned above, but a light source such as a LED, will be used to activate and speedup the bleaching process, so that it can be completed in less time. ?When nerve fillings are performed it can result in the discolouration of the tooth. For such a tooth, internal bleaching is available. The bleaching material will be inserted through the hole at the back of the nerve-filled tooth. The hole will then be closed for a certain period of time. Subsequently, the tooth?s colour will be checked with a colour code to confirm whether the tooth has reached the desired colour. If not, the process will be repeated until desired results are obtained,? he mentioned.? ?
There are alternative methods instead of bleaching. One such method is called veneers. It?s a lamination of the discoloured tooth with a very small thin layer of white dental material or porcelain. A thin lamination of white material will be pasted on the tooth. Bleaching treatment won?t be very effective in cases where the teeth are severely discoloured. In this case, a white porcelain crown treatment should be approached.? ?
?
Can you undergo teeth whitening?
Dr. Wickramasinghe strongly highlighted that there are particular patients for whom teeth whitening is strictly not recommended.? Patients with; unrealistic expectations, allergies to bleaching agents such as hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide, preexisting sensitive teeth, exposed dentine and those having taken drugs, patients with developmental defects in speech, those suffering from enamel corrosion, acid erosion and people who consume carbonated drinks and have gingival problems, tooth decay, abscesses, bad oral hygiene, loose teeth, severe gum diseases, pregnant and lactating mothers, children under the age of 16 and patients with visible white colour crown or fillings form the list.? ?
?
Risky Boundaries
The dental surgeon stressed that people who are interested in teeth whitening should thoroughly understand the risks that may pursuit during and after the teeth whitening procedure. ?These risks include hypersensitivity, irritation of gums and irritation of mucous membranes (lining of the mouth). There is a probability in uneven results of teeth shades after whitening. Teeth shades could also reverse back to the original status. Over bleaching (even when correct concentrations of bleaching agents are used, there are some instances where a case of over bleaching can occur in some patients),? cautioned Dr. Wickramasinghe.? ?
?
Maintenance? ??
Dr. Wickramasinghe stressed that maintenance after teeth whitening is important. ?Brushing and rinsing after every meal is a must. Whitening rinses should be used daily along with flossing to prevent tartar accumulation. Maintenance has to be followed properly to secure whitening results for longer. Carbonated fizzy drinks, red wine, deeply coloured foods like certain toffees should be avoided,? he said. After office bleaching, repeated bleaching or touch ups to restore the shade of the tooth can be done.? ?
Instead of considering the teeth whitening treatment, some may wonder how effective whitening toothpastes can be. ?They are effective, but results do not reach the level of whitening treatments. The use of whitening toothpastes can lead to other problems when used long term. Whitening toothpaste is harder on the teeth than normal toothpaste, so it causes abrasion? leading to? tooth sensitivity,? the dental surgeon concluded.? ?
