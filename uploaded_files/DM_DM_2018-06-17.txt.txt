Extend my term of office till next polls: Wigneswaran
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran said today he had no objection to the postponement of the elections to his provincial council provided that his term of office was extended up to the point of the next polls.
Mr. Wigneswaran told Daily Mirror he would be opposed to placing the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) under the purview of the Governor in the event the elections were postponed.
He said if the council was placed in the hands of the Governor as in the East, there was no use of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.
"Then, there is no devolution. The Central Government will do everything," he said.
Asked whether he would form a new political party, he said, Somebody has said that I wont be given nomination next time. Lots of people are asking me to stay. First, there is the chance of the party giving me nomination. Or else, I have to join another party and contest. Otherwise, I have to start up my own party. I have not made up mind yet. Nothing is definite. I do not personally want to start something. But, if am forced to, I would," he said.
The term of the NPC will expire in October. (Kelum Bandara)

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today said the amendments proposed by the Government to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act of 2002, were clearly aimed at assisting foreign courts in the trial of Sri Lankans for offences allegedly committed in Sri Lanka.
The Government has introduced in Parliament, a Bill to amend the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, No. 25 of 2002. This is the latest betrayal by the yahapalana Government.
This country has had its share of traitors in its long history, but never anyone as committed and enthusiastic in their betrayal as the present Government, he said in a statement.

SF withdraws his order to remove Sinharaja elephants
	
Minister of Wild Life Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka today revoked his original decision to remove two elephants from World Heritage site Sinharaja Forest Reserve.
Director General of Wild Life M. G. C. Suriyabandara said the Minister ordered to temporarily halt removing the elephants.
Despite President Maithripala Sirisena's order not to remove the two elephants on Friday (15), Wild Life officers continued search operations to find the two elephants in order to relocate them to some other place under Minister Fonsekas guidance.
A special team of Wild Life Officers was deployed to Sinharaja Forest with necessary tools like ropes, chains and other tools to load the elephants.
Instead of Wild Life Veterinary surgeons, Air Force Veterinary surgeons were deployed to the place with anesthetics to sedate the elephants.
Ministers stance was to remove the elephants for the safety of the people of the area despite the order of the President.
According to the Ministers order, the operation to catch the elephants was underway this morning.
Meanwhile, a protest organized against the removal of elephants was held in Rambuka village near the Sinharaja Forest today with the participation of professionals, environmentalists and residents of the area.
When inquired of this from the Assistant Director of Wild Life Prasanna Wimaladasa in Uva and Southern Provinces, he said the operation of catching the elephants was stopped under the instructions of the Minister of Wild Life and the Director General.(Ajithlal Shanthaudaya)

SL to release 10 Indian fishermen's boats
	
Sri Lankan Navy will soon release ten Indian fishermen's boats, which were taken into custody in 2015 and 2016, the India Today reported.
In 2017, over 42 boats out of the 216 boats in the Sri Lankan custody were released. The fishermen were only able to retrieve 32 of the 42 boats as the remaining ten were damaged beyond repair. Now, the Sri Lankan government has sent a letter to the Indian External Affairs Ministry on June 13 stating that they are ready to release ten other boats instead of the ones that was not retrieved in 2017.
Today, fishermen and a rescue team headed by Additional Director Fisheries Manikandan are getting set to leave for Sri Lanka in two days to retrieve the boats. The fishermen in the region are demanding that the remaining 174 boats in the Sri Lankan custody must be released and added that each boat costs Rs 8 to 10 lakh.
On July 4, the Indo-Sri Lankan officials are to meet in Delhi and the Tamil fishermen are demanding that their issues be discussed. They also want their remaining boats to be released.
"We will go and check the boats in Sri Lanka but we demand that all our boats in the Sri Lankan custody be released," said Jesuraj, fishermen leader from Rameshwaram.
The Sri Lankan fishermen too are of the opinion that the boats in Sri Lankan custody either be dispose off or returned to Indian fishermen.
"These seized boats are docked in our shore and it is so difficult for us to go to the sea for fishing. The tied boats tend to move astray and hit with the neighbouring damaging the docked boats as well as ours," said a Sri Lankan fisherman.
