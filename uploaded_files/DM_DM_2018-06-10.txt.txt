Holding election on time vital to protect democracy: Deshapriya
	
Holding elections on time is vital to protect democracy, franchise and peoples sovereignty in a country and delay in holding elections had resulted in destruction, the Chairman of Election Commission Mahinda Deshapriya said.
He stressed the importance of election at a seminar under the theme True democracy depends on the right to vote held to mark Voters Day by the Anuradhapura District Secretariat and Anuradhapura Regional Elections Offices on Friday.
The Elections Chief said that there had been three corrupt elections held in our country at times there was no ban imposed by any group of voters to go to the polling stations. One of these was the North Western PC election held in 1999, the other two were referendum of 1982, Jaffna District Development Council (DDC) Election held in 1981.
In the Jaffna district council elections, he recalled, outsiders from Colombo and Kurunegala without having rights to engage in duties at polling stations were deployed leading to disappearance of ballot boxes. Later some of them were found. And this incident was followed by an arson attack on the Jaffna Library in the night of the same day.
This incident also breached the confidence of moderate Tamil politicians on elections and paved the way for "bullet instead of ballot he pointed out.
Some see the riots in 1983 as the fuelling factor that strengthened the armed groups in the North. It is true but I consider 1981 DDC election as the point of emergence for these groups, Mr Deshapriya stated.
Reminiscing another landmark in the country's election history, the Elections Commission Chairman said on the basis of the number of votes polled by the political party represented by youth in the 1982 presidential election there was a possibility of securing five to ten seats by them if a general election that was to be held in 1983.
"But youth were deprived of this opportunity leaving them in a breached confidence in the election. This situation pushed some of them to take to arms. About 60,000 lives were perished in the uprising that followed, he recalled.
Thus inappropriate elections and postponing elections bring death and destruction, he asserted.
He said through the 1972 Constitution the five-year term of the then government was extended to six-year term and the then leader of the opposition J.R. Jayewardene resigned from his parliamentary seat and faced fresh polls setting an example for the politicians.
It is the duty of all the 225 members in Parliament to help holding of elections to North Central, Sabaragamuwa and Eastern PCs to give an opportunity to the voters to express their views, Mr. Deshpariya stressed. (Athula Bandara)

More than 2,500 journalists have descended on Singapore to cover the event, and will be based at a media centre at the F1 pit building.
The unprecedented meeting, the first time a sitting US president meets a North Korean leader, was nearly called off just two weeks before the event.
Ahead of his departure for Singapore, President Trump described the meeting as a "mission of peace", for which they had a "one-time shot". "I think within the first minute I'll know ... And if I think it won't happen - I'm not going to waste my time. I don't want to waste his time," he told the media at G7 summit in Quebec, Canada.(Channel News Asia)

MP Nalinda to take legal action agaist Maithri Gunarathna
	
Kalutara District JVP Parliamentarian Dr Nalinda Jayatissa says he would take legal action against Maithri Gunarathna, who had stated that he had obtained money from Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, Arjun Alloysius through Mr Mahesh Senanayaka.
In a Facebook post quoted by the JVP affiliated website "lankatruth" he says that Gunarathna's statement was malicious towards him.
He states throughout the past few days, those who had taken money from Aloysius and have been exposed, with proof, were attempting to mislead the public by pointing their fingers at others. It is not difficult to identify the person behind the voice of Maithri.
I have already taken measures to take legal action against Maithri Gunarathna, he said.
We call upon the people to take a decision regarding individuals who engage in committing mass scale frauds that make the whole society stink, the website quoted him as saying.

PM challenges MR: Tell me how to repay loans while reducing taxes
	
Responding to a claim by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa that he would reduce taxes by 20 percent after regaining power, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe challenged him on Saturday to reveal the country how the latter is going to repay the huge amount of loans the country owes to the other countries after reducing taxes.
Speaking at a function that was organised to declare open the iron bridge that has been constructed over the Kelani River connecting Siyane Korale and Hapitigama Korale at Ranwala, Dompe, the Prime Minister stated that he wanted to know how Mr. Rajapaksa is going to reduce taxes while at the same time repaying the foreign debt with interest.
The Prime Minister was referring to a statement made by the former President during an interview with a Sinhala newspaper days ago.
Claiming that his government had to pay the loans including one amounting around Rs. 21,000 million obtained by the previous regime for acquiring lands from all over the country, Mr. Wickremesinghe said that his government was paying for the sins of Mr. Rajapaksa.
The Prime Minister referred to the proverb "people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones" when he recalled how the government of former President who accuses the incumbent government now that it sells national assets to foreigners, sold 50 acres from the Port City outright to China and the land where the Army Headquarters was situated to a Chinese hotel.
He said that the country had to face several natural disasters such as floods, drought and the collapse of Meetotamulla garbage dump, yet the government has embarked on development projects such as the construction of Ranwala and Milleniya bridges. (Upali Ranaweera)
