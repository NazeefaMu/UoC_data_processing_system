Perpetrator names will never be published by OHCHR
	
	Despite many expecting a ?naming and shaming? in the content of the UN report on Sri Lanka, UN sources in Geneva state that the names of individuals accused of perpetrating the alleged abuses during the final phases of the conflict in Sri Lanka were never intended to be published in the report.
	Sources told Daily Mirror that the names of the accused were never intended to be included as part of the report as the OISL (OHCHR investigation on Sri Lanka) was a human rights investigation and not a criminal inquiry.
	It was pointed out that in the case of Sri Lanka; comparatively few lists were submitted to the investigation panel and that too through zonal investigation commissions as opposed to lists of names that were submitted in investigations such as the Commission of Inquiry on Syria.
	Even in the case of the CoI on Syria and its findings, the list of individuals accused of perpetrating abuses have been handed over to the High Commissioner and sources claim it would continue to remain in his possession alone until a credible, competent judicial investigation is carried out ? in which case the names would be passed on to the relevant authorities.
	Therefore, sources said it would be the same course of action that would be followed with concern to those whose names have been involved with perpetrating the alleged abuses during the final phases of the war in Sri Lanka.
	Meanwhile, OHCHR Media Officer Ravina Shamdasani who is currently in Sri Lanka speaking to Daily Mirror on the way forward, following the public release of the OISL report noted that it is time for action in Sri Lanka.
	?We hope that the government and people of Sri Lanka will take the time to study the report and perceive its contents in a positive light; as an opportunity and engage with us in ensuring the successful implementation of the recommendations,? she said.
	Speaking of the time frame during which these recommendations would be implemented, she noted that while it?s important to implement them promptly, it is also essential to ensure that the mechanisms are created following broad consultations with all stakeholders involved, particularly the victims, in order to ensure they are designed to succeed.

UN report calls for hybrid court
	
The UN report on Sri Lanka has identified ?patterns of grave violations in Sri Lanka between 2002 and 2011, strongly indicating that war crimes and crimes against humanity were most likely committed by both sides to the conflict?, UN Human Rights Chief Zeid Ra?ad Al Hussein said a short while ago as the much awaited report on Sri Lanka was made publicly available.
	
	The OISL was mandated at the UNHRC in March 2014 through US Sponsored resolution 25/1, which requested the High Commissioner to? ?undertake a comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka during the period covered by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), and to establish the facts and circumstances of such alleged violations and of the crimes perpetrated with a view to avoiding impunity and ensuring accountability, with assistance from relevant experts and special procedures mandate holders.?
	While the investigation was carried out by a group of OHCHR staff, the HC also appointed three experts including former Presidnet of Finland - Martti Ahtisaari, Former High Court Judge of New Zealand - Silvia Cartwright and former President of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan Asma Jahangir, to play a supportive and advisory role and to provide independent verification throughout the investigation.
	The recommendations of the OISL report included a call for a hybrid court to address war crimes committed by both sides of the conflict. However, the report hasn?t cited names of any particular individual responsible for crimes. Follow up criminal inquiry was required to understand individual criminal responsibilities clearly, the report further said.

Democratic Left Front (DLF) Leader and United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara today opined that it was not wise to create a breakaway party of UPFA as it would pave the way for the Maithripala - UNP alliance to take control of the party.
MP Nanayakkara who refused to accept the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena in UPFA, instead proposed that the party should contest the provincial council election without the backing of the President.
?We have all the liberty to use the name United Peoples Freedom Alliance. Not even the party chairman can take action against us for using the name. The technical issue we will face when contesting is using the betel leaf as it belongs to the party chairman. We will find a separate symbol, an independent one, to contest under,? he told a news briefing.
He said no one could take away their right of using party name but said if there were any obstacles, they would still use Peoples Freedom Alliance (PFA) to contest for election. (Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH
