CBSL debt management not audited for years: AG
	
The Auditor Generals Department told the Commission set up to inquire into the alleged Bond Scam yesterday (14)that not a single audit relating to domestic debt management at Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) in relation to Government Securities had been conducted over the years.
Non-disclosure of data relating to Government Securities by the Public Debt Department of CBSL was the cause for such failure, Auditor General, Gamini Wijesinghe alleged.
When questioned by the Commission, Auditor General Wijesinghe explained that the Auditor Generals Department had originally attempted to audit the CBSL in 2004, but there was a conflict with CBSL officials regarding the disclosure of market transactions details on the basis of a Secrecy clause.
After the first attempt to audit CBSL procedures, the Finance Ministry had sought the opinion of the Attorney General and subsequently, the Attorney General issuing a clarification the same year (2004) had prevented the audit from taking place quoting the secrecy clause as the reason for it, Mr. Gamini Wijesinghe said.
However, during cross examination by Counsel Harsha Fernando, who appeared for the interests of chairman of the Tender Board, it was discovered that the Attorney Generals clarification (in 2004) on the issue contained no such prevention to obtain certain secret information from the CBSL in the act of preparing an Audit Report by the Auditor General.
Consequently, SC Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned the witness as to why the Auditor Generals Department had failed to conduct an audit over the CBSL proceedings since 2004, as no legal barrier existed to stop them from doing so.
In reply, Mr. Wijesinghe was of the view that the Auditor Generals Department had continuously tried to obtain details from the CBSL even after 2004, but had come across much resistance due to nevertheless failed and faced many impediments due to the reluctance of the CBSL officials to cooperate.
However, the Auditor General also told the Commission that he needs more time to confirm the views expressed by him in this regard.
Despite the initial reluctance of CBSL officials the information relating to market transactions relating to the period February, 2015 to March, 2016 were handed over to the Auditor General by the CBSL in order for them to prepare an Audit Report on the controversial bond issuances during that period.
During the proceedings it was also revealed that Governments debt, borrowed using Direct Placement Method was approximately Rs. 4.7 trillion in the last eight years.
Meanwhile, during the cross examination conducted by Nihal Fernando PC, who appeared for the Perpetual Treasuries, Mr. Wijesinghe said officials of the Monetary Board and officials of the Public Debt Department should be held responsible for failing to issue treasury bonds at least cost to the State, because without replacing a alternation method, the exclusion Direct Placement Method had incurred huge losses to the government.
During further cross examination on the EPFs participation in the bond auction that took place in February 27, 2015, it was revealed, that despite sufficient fund being available to it the capability of the EPF Department in investing long term bonds (30-year-bonds) at the auction was questionable.
It was also explained during cross-examination with regards to the March 29, 2016 bond auction, that the value of the bids offered by the CBSL initially at the auction was Rs. 40 billion but it had unusually accepted Rs. 77.732 billion in bids exceeding the initial offering by Rs.37.732 billion, of which Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL) had obtained 60 %. It was noted that PTL had obtained bonds worth Rs. 26.41 billion out of the total issuance of bonds worth Rs. 77.732 billion at the auction.
Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando concluding his cross examination suggested that the Auditor Generals report was prepared with enormous errors and thereby it had affected the financial market, foreign investors and his client Perpetual Treasuries Ltd.
Refuting these views, the Auditor General emphasized that his report was prepared responsibly and accurately and therefore he would not withdraw a single word from the Special Audit Report submitted to Parliament on the controversial bond issue.
The inquiry of the Commission appointed by the President to inquire into the Treasury Bond issue comprising Supreme Court Judges K. T. Chitrasiri, Prasanna Jayawardena and former Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Velupillai will resume sittings today (15). (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Colombos houses  of cards Constructing crooked buildings: are more in line to collapse
	
With the sudden collapse of part of Excellency Building at Wellawatte, the public and the authorities are anxious about the remaining possibly unstable buildings in the area. After the tragic incident, a number of constructions came under scrutiny of local authorities. The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) has announced that new rules had been imposed on urban construction. Municipal Commissioner V.K.A. Anura said that once every three months the construction reports would be inspected by the CMC and the reports would be passed through a specially appointed committee.
The construction site is also to be supervised by the CMC officials. Unstable buildings are ordered to be demolished, and if the owner objected to demolition, the owner should to produce a report. If older buildings are demolished, the owner has to bear the cost, he said.
Sometimes there are design failures in constructing a building. The creative part of a design is done by an architect and then it is passed on to the structural engineer. Ground, soils bearing capacity, the closeness to the neighbouring construction; live load (People, furniture etc.) and dead load (Materials), the proper calculation for load are estimated and processed by an engineer.
Geologically active areas and unstable soil are also things better to avoid. Local authorities should not approve constructions in improper places
He is responsible for the practicality of the structure. And the engineer and the architect have to work in collaboration. Sometimes, building owners over-load their buildings. In buildings, which are originally designed to bear the weight of 100 people, the owner adds 1,000 people.
When asked about carrying on constructions close to water bodies he noted:
There should be a reservation between the water body and the construction site, depending on the wideness of the water body. Geologically active areas and unstable soil are also things better to avoid. Local authorities should not approve constructions in improper places. And the constructor has to comply withthe standard.
Theres a loophole in the system
When he was inquired about the collapsed building in Wellawatte, he avoided giving a comment as the Corporation Report is under the purview of the courts, saying that They hadnt followed the accepted standards and he mentioned that the Wellawatte case would get two to three months to be solved.
The authorities have given us some general information on common construction mistakes in multi - storey buildings.
Generally, there are some issues to be addressed when constructing multi - floored buildings. Local authority approval - building permit, which is now under the purview of the UDA. On the engineering side, it is mandatory to hire a professional architect and an engineer, who are capable of doing this type of buildings.
The Institution of Engineers of Sri Lanka (IESL) has a categorised directory of professionals specialised in structural design in multi - storey buildings. The categories are 2-4 storey buildings, 4-8 storey buildings, 8 - 20 storey buildings and Above 20 storey building category.
There are only a few of structural engineers, who are capable of doing above 20 storey structures. Additionally, there are Chartered Architects. Both of them take the responsibility of design. And the structural engineer has to certify the building is safe enough to occupy, he said.
He also pointed out the importance of soil tests:
It is always advisable to do a proper soil investigation test. Then the structural engineer will be able to get the correct parameters of the soil to do the foundation design. For multi - storey buildings, it is good to get a soil investigation test done by qualified geo-technical engineers, which is a must.
But everything depends on payments. Sometimes, people get only the Architect for the building, leaving out the structural engineer. Even Chartered Civil Engineers are capable of designing four storey buildings.
If the construction period is prolonged, people have to extend it once a year. In the the whole of Colombo, there are a number of constructions that are in breach of regulations. Unfortunately, this particular place was subjected to the collapse. Either the local authorities are not checking it or at the end of the construction the certificate of conformity, but the municipality doesnt know unless someone sends a petition that a certain building doesnt have a CoC (Certificate of Conformity).
Engineers of the CMC come for inspection only if the owner had a CoC for the building. Even though the Municipality issues a permit and the CoC, theres a loophole in the system. There is no way to know what happens in-between.
Regular visits or monitoring systems should be introduced by the local authorities to make sure the builders go with a plan. Some people extend the building after having the CoC inspected. Some people dont want to get a CoC. Therefore, educating people to have the CoC is a must.
- Engineer D.T Rajasekaran
General Manager of State Engineering Corporation and Structural Engineer
Investigations underway
M.R. Jeyachandran, the Director General of Buildings Department directed us to the Additional DG (Engineering Services) M.H.M Ismail regarding the report of the collapsed building. Ismail said that the debris of the collapsed building was still being cleared and therefore they were unable to inspect the foundation, and they were still carrying out the investigations.

Overloadings building
A reliable source from The National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) said their judgment on the tragedy is overloading the building.
According to their investigations, the columns of the building were strong and soil layers were normal to the GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) tests they carried out.
It turns out there are more buildings in line to collapse if necessary safety precautions are not followed by the public, regarding new constructions as well as remaining buildings, which need to be renovated, an official said.
Both the general public and the authorities should understand the importance of following regulations, the official said.
For a construction, the permission from the CMC is necessary. There are some technical defects that are not demanded much from the CMC, like structure and strength.
The collapsed building in Wellawatte was designed by a member of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects (SLIA) and this information was given to me by the President of the Institute of Architects. The original design was for a three storey building, and the structure was designed by an engineer and approved by the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). But the proprietor built three or more floors above that.
The owner of the building is responsible for violating the law and the CMC is responsible for not monitoring the development and occupation of the building. Nobody can occupy a building unless the CMC issues a Certificate of Conformity (CoC). Theres nothing wrong with the engineering or the design, it is the law-breaking citizen, who had not followed the procedure, who is responsible.
For a construction within Councils limits, permission from the CMC is mandatory. There are technicalities that are not carefully scrutinised by the CMC-like structure and strength. Some people just design and pass it on to the mason, omitting the engineer because engineers increase the number of rebars (Reinforcing bars) in a building and calculate the strength of the building. Theres no system to certify the system step by step either. Construction of complicated and large buildings should have at least a contractor, designer, and structural engineer.

Dolls get soul sendoff for the afterlife in animist Japan
	

AFP, 14th JUNE, 2017- Hundreds of dolls, from Hello Kitty to Disney favourites, are packed to the ceiling at a funeral homenear Tokyo.
But theyre not here for show: the dolls destined for dumpsters are getting a final sendoff for the afterlife.
The ceremony this week underlines Japans still-strong belief that all things -- from shrimps and eggs to scissors and rocks -- have a soul.
About 20 doll owners chanted a sutra with Buddhist monk Shingyo Goto as he performed the sendoff ceremony in the doll-stuffed room, filled with the heady scent of incense.
We believe a soul lives inside dolls, so I perform a service to take the spirits out of them and express the feeling of gratitude to them before bidding them farewell, said Goto, who lives at the prestigious Yakushiji temple in the ancient city of Nara.
Japans neon-lit capital may look ultra-modern, but many in the country of 127 million still hold tightly to longstanding traditions, including the animist beliefs linked to its dominant religions: Buddhism and native Shintoism.

President Maithripala Sirisena was of the view that those persons who had failed in their efforts to challenge his leadership since his nomination as the common candidate for the Presidency have now resorted to black magic and the country knows who the culprits are.
The President made these comments at an event to celebrate the 38th anniversary of the ITN (Independent Television Network), where he also declared open a new
five-storyed building in the ITN premises.
The President said he read the news about black magic being used to displace him in the morning papers and regarded it as a foolish deed but warned that he would never be shaken by these actions but rather it would only help to spur him on to achieve greater things in the future.

## Title: Fast, seek inner-peace and heal your body within

Fast, seek inner-peace and heal your body within
	
O ye who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed on those before you that you may become righteous
- Al- Quran; 2:183 
With the intention of becoming righteous, Muslims solely fast to please the creator of mankind as he alone knows how much sincerity weighs in the hearts and deeds of every being. Fasting teaches the principle of sincere love because a person who fasts does so out of deep love for God and those who love God truly know what love is. 
Fasting is certainly one of the foremost duties of a Muslim in the blessed month of Ramadhan. It is obligatory for every Muslim of sound mental and physical well-being. We are aware that great religious leaders fasted during their lifetime albeit their followers did not always follow suit. Jesus (pbuh) and Moses (pbuh) in the Bible, and Gautama Buddha in Buddhism, too observed fast and achieved great heights through this element of devotion. 
The great leap in todays sciences has made it easy for us to decipher the benefits of fasting. The three fathers of Western medicine: Hippocrates, Galen and Paracelsus, prescribed fasting as the physician within. Renowned physicians worldwide recommend fasting as the medicine for the 21st century, thereby labelling it the remedy to heal ones body within. If given an opportunity, the body has the unique ability to heal itself. 
Germanys great fasting therapist Dr. Otto Buchinger declared: Fasting is no doubt the most effective biological method of treatment, the operation without surgery, a treatment evolving exudation, redirection, loosening up and purified relaxation. He stresses that most modern-day illnesses could be cured through fasting. Cardiovascular and chronic digestive system diseases, painful and inflammatory illnesses of the joints, numerous disorders of eating behaviour, malfunction of kidneys, glaucoma, skin disease, allergies, tension and migraine could be cured through fasting. This God given mercy and boundless gift of fasting is designed to cleanse, regenerate, rejuvenate and restore the sense of physical, mental and spiritual well-being of an individual. 
Renowned physicians worldwide recommend fasting as the medicine for the 21st century, thereby labelling it the remedy to heal ones body within. If given an opportunity, the body has the unique ability to heal itself
Dr. Buchinger reckons that when the body fasts, the soul is hungry and when the body is lighter, the soul craves for relief. Indeed, fasting decomposes all aged, damaged, diseased, weakened and dead cells and tissues a detoxification process. 
Abstaining from consuming food and beverage is only one aspect of fasting. Abstention from sinful behaviour is often overlooked. Thus, fasting provides an opportunity to purify the mind as well as the body. When a fasting person goes without food and water continuously for one month from dawn to dusk, he or she acquires the knowledge of compassion and empathy towards those in hunger. Refraining from food and water as well as vain and bad behaviour allows a person to strive for patience, gratitude and humility -- life lessons that elevate a persons disciplinary standards. 
A sound conscience is instilled in a fasting person because he has to keep his fast secretly and publicly since no authority except God alone for whose sake he observes the fast knows his intentions. A lesson of great patience and selflessness is taught as a person who is observing a fast goes through the pangs of hunger and deprivation of impulses and needs but bears them patiently, solely to please his creator. A person who fasts until sunset needs a strong sense of willpower, combined with self-control, brilliant lessons for life. 
If one fasts without realising its true meaning or with an attitude of indifference, then he or she fails to derive the real benefits of fasting. There is divine help to the believer who is committed to fasting. The human body has a unique ability to adapt and does so within the first few days of fasting. It adapts to a new schedule reducing the normal hunger we feel without food and water. 
The community spirit and unity reach new heights when fellow believers are seen fasting with you, waking up for a pre-dawn meal and sharing it or the food at the time of breaking fast. This cycle of training for one whole month from deprivation of bodily appetite frees the soul from carnal desires and greed. Hunger makes us remember that our carnal desires are our servants and that God has given us the supreme ability to control them. 
Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), the last and final messenger to mankind, said: If a person does not control his or her senses and behaviour, then God does not require that person to refrain from eating. He further added that if someone verbally abuses, acts ignorantly or hurts another, then respond saying: I am fasting.  Fasting provides benefits to society too. The personal knowledge of hunger and deprivation makes us realise the true sense of hunger and poverty. Whilst learning the lesson of deep gratitude to your maker and provider, you become more generous and charitable to fellow human beings less fortunate than you. So it is why God made Zakah -- a form of charity obligatory for able Muslims to give away 2.5% of their annual earnings to the needy in the month of Ramadan.
Fasting is certainly one of the foremost duties of a Muslim in the blessed month of Ramadhan. It is obligatory for every Muslim of sound mental and physical well-being. We are aware that great religious leaders fasted during their lifetime albeit their followers did not always follow suit
Fasting in the glorious month of Ramadan is a commitment fulfilled by the faithful to their creator, the physical and spiritual training of one month every year through fasting, extra hours of night prayers and charity empower us to marvelously sail through lifes journey with inner-peace, tranquility, truth, justice and compassion.

Flood disaster: UN appeals for more resources
	
Following last month's severe flooding and landslides in Sri Lanka that impacted some 630,000 people, the United Nations and humanitarian partners yesterday launched an urgent appeal for more resources to reach those in the worst-hit parts of the country with urgent assistance.
Immediately after the disaster, UN agencies and relief partners responded with assistance in priority sectors identified by the Government. However, access to the most remote communities was cut off due to destroyed roads and bridges.
As flood waters recede and more areas become accessible, the extent of damage and the response needed is revealed: emergency shelter, sanitation and hygiene, and health services are high on the list. On top of this, damaged infrastructure, particularly related to water and hygiene, has increased the risk of waterborne diseases.
According to the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the Emergency Response Plan  amounting to $22.7 million  launched by the Humanitarian Country Team, focuses on providing immediate life-saving and protection assistance, emergency livelihood support, and access to basic services to people worst hit.
The Plan also aims to strengthen resilience of affected communities to cope with and recover from the disaster.
It targets about 374,000 people in seven districts, including the four most affected districts  Galle, Rathnapura, Kalutara and Matara.
The Humanitarian Country Team, with the support of the international community, will continue responding to the needs of those affected by the floods through the implementation of the Emergency Response Plan, paying particular attention to supporting the most vulnerable people in the affected communities, highlighted Una McCauley, UN Resident Coordinator for Sri Lanka and the Chair of the Team.
OCHA also reported that an allocation of US$ 4 million was made by the UN Central Emergency Response Fund to assist rapid delivery of life-saving shelter, health and food assistance, as well as provide essential non-food items.
Cash assistance will also be provided to affected people to meet their shelter and food needs, in addition to the provision temporary shelters, shelter repair kits, and emergency healthcare and reproductive healthcare support.

Garbage a curse to streets of Colombo
	
Over the past couple of weeks, if one were to roam through the streets of Colombo they would probably not be able to do so without covering their nose and mouth due to the strong stench of garbage. Ever since the collapse of the man-made garbage dump in Meethotamulla which killed 32 innocent citizens in early April, the collection of garbage in Colombo has been irregular. 
The Daily Mirror spoke to garbage collectors in the city last week and learnt that they were told not to collect the garbage that was dumped on the roads as there was no place to accumulate non-segregated garbage. They further said they were informed to refrain from collecting the garbage that had not been separated in households and shops. 
Accumulation of garbage on the streets can give rise to many health risks if not cleared in an efficient manner
The Daily Mirror approached Professor Arjuna de Silva who said that this accumulation of garbage on the streets can give rise to many health risks if not cleared in an efficient manner. 
Meanwhile, many leading schools in Colombo have started their own garbage management with the encouragement of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) and the Ministry of Education. Segregation of garbage has been initiated in schools where separate bins have been allocated for degradable and non-degradable waste, while the distribution of food in paper bags instead of polythene has begun. Schools have further advised their students to use polythene less and to bring their lunch in lunch boxes. 
The Daily Mirrorfurther learns that piling dumps of garbage on the streets will be collected and the streets of Colombo will be cleared of this menace, with hopes that such an issue will not arise again and that people will learn to separate their garbage in order to ensure that the management of garbage in the city will go smoothly.
Garbage on the streets of Colombo
According to CMC Commissioner V.K.A. Anura the CMC had implemented a policy to collect the segregated garbage from November 1 last year, Although we had implemented such a regulation we gave the people many chances to start segregating their garbage and we continued to collect the garbage. We kept accepted the garbage but they did not start the segregation process. When we stopped collecting the garbage that had not been segregated the people started to dump their unsegregated garbage on the streets. People acted indifferently to the regulations given and dumped their garbage in front of houses and temples thinking that it would be collected from the roads. We fully expect the people to separate their garbage into degradable waste and non-degradable waste 
Military police who have been relieved of their duties will be patrolling the streets in the nights in order to prevent and catch those who dump on the streets. This is the current action that we are taking to be rid of this problem
Speaking of what the garbage collectors had related he further said,  There is no place for us to keep the garbage that has not been separated, which is why we didnt collect it. However, when it comes to the garbage that has been segregated we have places to take them to and recycle. 
Speaking of what will be done to overcome the problem of garbage being dumped on
the streets, Mr. Anura said, Military police who have been relieved of their duties will be patrolling the streets in the nights in order to prevent and catch those who dump on the streets. This is the current action that we are taking to be rid of this problem. 
Mr. Anura further said that the CMC has not being collecting the garbage that was on the roads in order to send out the message that the garbage needs to be segregated since the people did not abide by that rule. Now we feel that the people have come to understand that the garbage needs to be separated in order to be collected, which is why we will be cleaning up the streets. 
At School Level
The Daily Mirror spoke to leading schools in Colombo and learnt that the CMC and the Ministry of Education is taking steps to start garbage management at school level. Schools such as Royal College, Ladies College, Visakha Vidyalaya and St. Bridgets Convent stated that their garbage is being collected by the CMC but they have been advised to separate the garbage into degradable and non-degradable waste.
Schools such as Visakha and Ladies are separating the garbage in bins and sending away waste such as paper for recycling and food waste for composting and have started the practice of giving food in paper bags in their canteens. Schools have also advised their students and teachers to bring their food in boxes instead of polythene bags.
Schools such as Visakha and Ladies are separating the garbage in bins and sending away waste such as paper for recycling and food waste for composting
We further learnt that more time needs to be given in larger schools such as Royal College in order to get the students used to the segregation process and that they are working to reduce the amount of non-degradable waste that is created.  Many meetings and awareness programmes have been conducted for officials in the schools to encourage them to manage and reduce the garbage in the respective schools.
Health Consequences due to the Accumulation of Garbage
According to Professor Arjuna de Silva, Professor in Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama there are many health consequences that can arise due to the accumulation of garbage in the area.  The obvious consequence is dengue. Because it has been shown that dengue mosquitoes can breed even in dirty water now and not just clean water. There will be an increase in flies in the area which would lead to a rise in food borne and fly borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, dysentery 
If the garbage starts contaminating the water supply, such as our drinking water and the water we use for washing:many issues can arise on a domestic level
He further said that if the garbage starts contaminating the water supply, such as our drinking water and the water we use for washing: many issues can arise on a domestic level. Fly borne, mosquito borne, even filaria like diseases and even skin allergies can increase.  Analysing the consequences at school level, he said,In schools, as there is a large population of young people in one place, who are very susceptible compared to older people and there is the danger of the spread of contagious diseases. As older people have built immunity over such diseases over the years such a high risk does not crop up for them.

Governor wants CV to prove his clout
	
In the wake of the no confidence motion submitted, Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray asked Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran to establish whether he enjoyed the majority support in the council within the stipulated time.
Fifteen members of the Northern Provincial Council has handed over a no confidence motion against the Chief Minister. Besides, this group which comprises members of the opposition seeks to rope in three more members to their side against the Chief Minister.
The Governor said steps would be taken to inform the Chief Minister to establish whether he enjoyed the majority support of the council.
He said so when asked about the no-faith motion against the Chief Minister that was handed over by a group of members of the Northern Provincial Council.
He said steps would be taken to inform the Chief Minister to prove this in due course and also said it was his duty to confirm the receipt of such a petition.
Accordingly, the Governor will take steps to get the affidavits from the members who signed the no-faith motion and to ensure the authenticity of the signatures placed by the members.
A meeting was to be conducted last evening to discuss the crisis triggered by the move to unseat the Chief Minister in this manner. (Romesh Madushanka)

Govt. has messed up the Cabinet reshuffle: Dinesh
	
The joint opposition said the recent Cabinet reshuffle and the allocation of ministry subjects have not been carried out on a scientific basis despite the governments assurance to do so.
Joint opposition leader and MP, Dinesh Gunawardena told a news conference on Wednesday that the government had attempted to carry out the Cabinet reshuffle for past several months. The Finance Minister and the Foreign Affairs Minster exchanged portfolios, he said.
The MP said it was surprising to see the Mass Media Ministry brought under the Finance Minister.
Making matters worse higher education and transportation have been put under a single ministry. There is a huge difference between these two sectors. While the Foreign Affairs Minister has been entrusted with the National Lotteries Board and the Development Lotteries Board, which should be under the purview of the Finance Minister. This is a disgrace to the country, he said and added that such combinations are unique to Sri Lanka.
These reshuffles are of no use. They have not benefited the country but worsened the situation, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Gunman fires on Republican lawmakers
	

REUTERS, 14th JUNE, 2017-A gunman opened fire on Wednesday on Republican U.S. lawmakers who were practicing near Washington for a charity baseball game, wounding senior Republican leader Steve Scalise and several others before being taken into custody, police and witnesses said.
The gunman died later of his injuries, President Donald Trump announced at the White House.
Lawmakers said the shooter, who was armed with a rifle, had exchanged fire with Capitol Hill police who were at the scene and was shot before being taken into custody.
Scalise, No. 3 in the House of Representatives Republican leadership, was shot in the hip at the baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia. He was tended to by fellow lawmakers including Brad Wenstrup, an Ohio congressman who is a physician, before being transported to a hospital.
Five people were taken from the scene to hospitals, Alexandrias police chief, Michael Brown, told reporters. Two of the wounded were Capitol Hill police, witnesses said. Trump, a Republican, said Scalise, a Louisiana congressman, was badly injured but in stable condition. He said two of the wounded were congressional staffers.
At a news conference, authorities declined to identify the suspect. The Washington Post, quoting unnamed law enforcement officials, identified him as James Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Illinois. The Post reported that he owned a home inspection business.

Health Ministry's arbitrary actions risk patients' lives: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today urged the Health Ministry to immediately implement the transfers of the doctors by dodging the ministrys weaknesses without criticising others in order to conceal their shortcomings.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Naveen de Soyza said that the entire health sector had been deteriorated due to several actions taken by the Health Ministry and added that the ministrys arbitrary nature had risked the lives of the innocent patients.
Health Ministrys responsibility is to implement the transfers of the doctors in a transparent manner by following the establishment code. But unfortunately the ministry has delayed the internal transfers of the specialists for seven months, he said.
He said that the transfers for doctors attached to the North Eastern Province had been delayed for two years. He also said that special appeal list had been subjected to the same fate.
He said that the inconvenience faced by the patients due to this issue was inevitable and added that there would be risk of closing down the terminal hospitals as the result.
The terminal hospitals which are ready to open, have also halted due to this delay in doctors' transfers, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Losses reduced after formation of Unity Govt., says Sri Lankan Airlines
	
The management of Sri Lankan Airlines yesterday said that since the Unity government was formed, the airlines losses have been dramatically reduced.
Issuing a statement, the Sri Lankan Airlines said;
Contrary to inaccurate reports in the press, the management of Sri Lankan Airlines would like to point out that since the Unity government was formed, the airlines losses have been dramatically reduced. The table below clearly shows this: LKR 91.8 Billion in losses between 2011 & 2015 reduced to a fraction of this colossal number by 2017.
The fuel price reduction of 2015 saw a drop in ticket prices that did not recover when fuel increased again. The effect of this, coupled with the acceptance of several new (and expensive) aircraft, a depreciation of the LKR and other currencies against the USD (the majority of airline costs are in USD) saw a weakening of the balance sheet in 2016.
The airline continues to pay a heavy price for the extremely high lease rental agreements entered into by the previous government. The cost of terminating the leases on four A350-900 aircraft that were grossly overpriced and completely unsuitable for the national carrier, imposed a further burden on the airline.
The airline is now undergoing a modest recovery in revenues and about to launch significant regional expansion. Three new destinations in India, direct flights to Hong Kong & Bangkok and a long awaited non-stop service to Australia are all planned in the coming months.
Further restructuring is required in order to reduce the cost base and make the company competitive in this extremely challenging market.
The Directors and management team are confident that with the support of the shareholder, the recovery of the national airline will continue and the positive trend will be further improved upon.

A group of family members of missing persons including Sandya Eknaligoda, wife of missing journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda, had reportedly attempted to wade towards the deep sea off Trincomalee today in protest to the governments alleged failure to look into the investigations of the missing persons.
However, the attempt was prevented by the villagers. The group staged a protest outside the Trincomalee Governors office by displaying the pictures of the disappeared prior to wading into deep waters.
The protestors strongly demanded the government to expose what had happened to the disappeared and to ban the Prevention of Terrorism Act and release all political prisoners.
The relatives of disappeared from Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Jaffna and Vavuniya participated in the protest.
Prageeth Eknaligoda was a cartoonist, political analyst and a journalist was reported missing on January 24, 2010, just two days before the presidential polls. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

PM urges action to minimize negative effects on tea industry
	
Highlighting that the recent adverse weather conditions could affect the low grown tea industry, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today requested state officials to take immediate action to minimize such negative effects.
Speaking to state officials at the Baduraliya Divisional Secretariat, the Prime Minister requested them to clear the roads leading to tea estates and factories in the area which were blocked as a result of landslides.
Livelihood of the people in these areas seemed to be affected. Most of the people are involved in tea industry. Therefore roads which have been blocked should be cleared so that people could go and work in tea factories and in the estates," he said.
We initially did not expect the disaster would reach serious proportions. However, it would have been worse if the state workers had not put in their efforts to control the situation. I was told that some state officials worked without even stopping for their meals and they should be commended for it," the Prime Minister added.
He said state workers in the area would start discussions with owners of estates to get them to allocate lands for those displaced by the floods and landslides. (Yohan Perera)

The Lester James Peries: underlying underside
	
My first real encounter with cinema was through a VHS tape that was bought when I turned 16. I had heard and read of T. E. Lawrence, I knew what he had done and I was entranced by his exploits, but I hadnt seen David Leans film. Lawrence of Arabia, then, was the first film I watched with any serious intent (not that I hadnt tried before). By the end of the second hour, it ceased being a work of art. It instead became a miracle: What a bold, mad act of genius it was, to make it, or even think that it could be made was how the late Roger Ebert reviewed it. 
Theres a sequence in Lawrence of Arabia I go to again and again. Gasim, a member of a contingent led by Colonel Lawrence to launch a surprise attack on a city, succumbs to fatigue and falls down from his camel one night. This is in the Nefud Desert, so rescuing him was out of the question. Lawrence, however, goes back, to the consternation of his de facto deputy and rival, Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif). With the expedition halted, one of the mans aides, a boy called Daud, awaits him on a camel in the heat and sun. What unfolded next convinced me that some things could only be depicted in the cinema.  Daud looks on, Maurice Jarres music slowly picks up and a barely visible dot crops up in the distance. Daud trudges on nervously, sees that dot growing to a figure and sees that its (who else) Lawrence. Jarres music rises to a crescendo, Daud starts shouting in joy and we see our hero with the man he went back to rescue. The camera cuts to a long shot of the man and the boy riding towards each other and converging. I watched this on TV: I am praying for the day Ill see it on the big screen (which is what its Super Panavision 70 setup was born for, come to think of it). 
But Im digressing here. 
I met Lester James Peries for the first time four years ago. He was 94 at the time. I dont remember the exact day and month. I do remember waiting for him in his verandah, though. I also remember a small figure, clad in a sarong and a shirt (signifying the synthesis of East and West in him, perhaps) beckoning me to the sitting room. We sat, he smiled, and conversation ensued. After a few preliminary introductions, we swerved off to the movies. Halfway through that conversation, he asked me the inevitable question: What kind of cinema do you like David Lean, I blurted out at once, half-expecting him to assent to my choice. 
Lester smiled. We sat in silence, awkward because I badly needed a comment from him on the man whod taught him and his crew how to replicate rain in the final sequence of Rekava. Because no answer was forthcoming, I asked him as to what he thought of Lawrence of Arabia. His reply Those were big budget epics, not my kind of cinema. Being an idealist whod grown up on T. E. Lawrence, I was rather flabbergasted. I therefore asked as to what his favourite film was. I cant pick on one, he smiled, But if I were forced to, Id take a risk with Citizen Kane. 
That was the first day. The weeks flew by, I went on with my life, and at the end of the month, I returned. For the next three years, I made it a point to visit him, to talk with him, to get from him those little anecdotes that made up the man. Predictable though his cinema was, I learnt soon enough that his perspectives on his field were (for the lack of a better way of putting it) quirky. Here then is the first of a series of sketches on him, his work, and his conception of the medium he worked in. 
Lester James Peries fascination with the American cinema has gone unnoticed by the critic. For the most. This omission can be attributed to several factors, not least of which is his relationship with the French cinema: more than any other country, lets not forget, it was the country of Cocteau, Renoir, and Bresson that pushed him to the movies. That painterly outlook reminiscent of the best of Renoirs films (like La Rgle du jeu and Boudu Saved from Drowning) shows quite discernibly in Lesters work. The Italians helped. So did the British. But those were not his only influences. 
If the French are akin to painters (as with Cocteau and Renoir), the Americans are akin to technicians (as with Ford: Directing is not a mystery, its not an art). For the former, the creative process could best be birthed instinctively. For the latter, that process was secondary to the studio system. The director of Citizen Kane, Orson Welles, was an enfant terrible in that respect: he was considered a prestige failure, the same unlovely sobriquet Lester earned in much of his career. 
Welles influence on Lester comes out most strikingly in one respect: his eye for witty, nimble cutting. The final argument between mother and son in Delovak Athara, the arguments among mother, father, and daughter in Ran Salu and the bedside feud between brother and sister in Nidhanaya: here the camera is a dextrous participant, revealing the characters insecurities in gushes and torrents. They sometimes touch on comedy (think of the farcical argument between the protagonists and his fiances families over a tea-tray in Delovak Athara) and then suddenly culminate on a different, unresolved note. 
In this respect, Lester was closer to Welles than to Hollywood. When in 2012 Vertigo bested Citizen Kane in Sight & Sounds annual list of the 10 greatest movies of all time, I was stumped, not so much because Vertigo was inferior (it wasnt) but because it seemed to reflect my generations discontent with letting Welles first and greatest work remain at the top. About a year later, talking with Lester, I asked him as to what he thought. Heres what he said: 
Some films are specific to their time. They age. Others are not. They are timeless. For me, Hitchcocks films are for the most seasonal, framed as they are to the period they were made in. His discoveries were in the realm of editing, for he was primarily an entertainer: those discoveries therefore belong to the technicians workshop. Welles, on the other hand, innovated on so many other fronts: cinematography, editing, even acting, to name a few. That is why, despite what your generation may think, Kane remains for me the true landmark. Not even Vertigo can dispute that. 
To my mind, therefore, his two greatest influences came from two utterly different industries: continental Europe and the United States (of Orson Welles). His films, at that level, can be assessed on how much of a balance he kept between these two, which is how one can differentiate between Gamperaliya and Nidhanaya. The former was the inevitable consequence of Rekava and the more mainstream Sandeshaya, while the latter was the culmination of the creative freedom he was granted by the only producer that stayed with him for more than two films, Ceylon Theatres. 
In my next piece on the man, Ill try to make a contrast between these two, not to show what the superior objet dart is but rather to show how two seemingly similar films, adapted from a largely realist and modernist literature, can explain the balance Lester kept between the painterly thrust of continental Europe and the chiaroscuro boldness of the Americans. For the time being, though, I am done.

Traditional Arts in the context of Globalization
	
International Conference -2017 organised by the Swamy Vipulananada Institute of Aesthetic studies
International conferences are important especially in the field of academics and they play a pivotal role in many ways. They help to create awareness among scholars about current issues and topics vital for the development of a nation as a whole. International conferences are conducted in all fields to ensure that students and scholars benefit from them. It is a way of connecting different people from different places to focus on a particular topic to be discussed, which is of importance to the community as well as individuals. 
An international conference provides opportunities to meet people from the same field and helps keep track of all advances in a particular field. Making a presentation gives a chance to students and scholars to expose their work and get insight into other scholarly works and gain new ideas from other academics. Academic conferences are always highly productive events for the expansion of knowledge. 
In this regard, Swamy Vipulananada Institute of Aesthetic studies conducts its International Conference every year on different themes relevant to the current situation in Sri Lanka. In 2016, the theme for the conference was Traditional Arts in the context of Globalization. Following the same line, this year, the theme of the conference is designed to get more insight into a more relevant and important sphere. The theme of the 2017 International conference is Challenges and Importance of Intangible Cultural Heritage in times of War and Post War. With a thought-provoking theme, the conference is scheduled for three days from 15-17 June. The inaugural ceremony will commence today, followed by various other sessions on the remaining two days. 
The theme for this year Challenges and Importance of Intangible Cultural Heritage in times of War and Post War is significant because of its close link to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka, a country known for its cultural background, almost lost its identity during the war. The prolonged conflict destroyed not only the lives of thousands but its precious culture as well. 
Before going deeper into the topic certain things have to be made clear. Heritage refers to things that are of great importance and can be passed on to future generations. This heritage can be broadly classified into two main categories Natural Heritage and Cultural Heritage. 
Natural Heritage, as the term indicates, refers to natural aspects like landscape, flora, fauna and beaches
Natural Heritage, as the term indicates, refers to natural aspects like landscape, flora, fauna and beaches. On the other hand Cultural Heritage refers to cultural aspects like monuments, heritage sites, folklore and traditional activities which are culturally significant. 
This cultural heritage can be further divided into Tangible Cultural Heritage and Intangible Cultural Heritage. Tangible Cultural heritage can be seen and touched and those that depict the countrys history and cultural monuments, shrines, monasteries and other physical infrastructure are culturally important. 
Intangible cultural heritage cannot be touched or seen but can be felt and includes traditional music, folklore, languages and other intangible forms of art. Though they are less discussed, they are vital for human existence and cultural transition. 
While discussing the Cultural Heritage of the world, tangible Cultural Heritage takes the predominant position and are more authoritative compared to intangible cultural heritage. This can be seen worldwide and is always a topic of discussion among scholars all over the world. In this regard, art, architecture and sites gain importance in tangible cultural heritage.  Though rituals, celebrations, practices and performances are considered important parts of socio-cultural events and help in the betterment of life, they are rarely given due importance, discussed in public or documented. In folklore and folktales to some extent, they are given importance but in a Sri Lankan context, especially in the North, they are kept under wraps. 
In this regard, during the war and post-war period, cultural heritage attains popularity in shaping society and facing many challenges. These challenges seem to gain importance too.
The release from war, disaster, dislocation and resettlement, feelings, knowledge and skills are considered vital to rebuild life and these seem to be ignored in todays world. It is also campaigned that intangible cultural heritage is discussed only for the purpose of documentation and business. But in reality they are of key concern because they discuss human society and human evolution and movement.They help in the Independent existence of generations and are a pathway for restrictions and regulations. 
Thus, with realization or without realization or knowingly or unknowingly, intangible cultural heritage designs life. Therefore, to draw attention to intangible cultural heritage and understand its relevance in todays world, the International Conference 2017 is designed exclusively to get the younger generation involved in things which are of importance.
The conference is designed for scholars from various disciplines and apart from scholars and research scholars, who play the key role, it also focuses on artists, professionals and other experts in various field to take part in participatory research studies which help in fruitful discussions. 
In this respect, research is also classified into different dimensions such as performances and exhibitions to bring. These international conferences help upcoming researchers evaluate their works through discussions with scholars and are a driving force for other conferences in years to come. 
The International Conference 2017 will commence with the Inaugural Ceremony today at 6 o clock in the evening followed by various sessions tomorrow and day after. In addition to this, an open interactive session and cultural site visit is scheduled for June 18, to make the conference memorable. It will be of much benefit to professionals and academics from different disciplines and people from all walks of life.

US blames North Korea for hacking spree, says more attacks likely
	

The U.S. government on Tuesday issued a rare alert squarely blaming the North Korean government for a raft of cyber attacks stretching back to 2009 and warning that more were likely. 
The joint warning from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said that cyber actors of the North Korean government, referred to in the report as Hidden Cobra, had targeted the media, aerospace and financial sectors, as well as critical infrastructure, in the United States and globally. The new level of detail about the U.S. governments analysis of suspected North Korean hacking activity coincides with increasing tensions between Washington and Pyongyang because of North Koreas missile tests. The alert warned that North Korea would continue to rely on cyber operations to advance its military and strategic objectives. 
North Korea has routinely denied involvement in cyber attacks against
other countries.
