60 condemned prisoners get deaths sentence commuted to life imprisonment
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has given his consent to commute deaths sentence to life imprisonment on 60 condemned prisoners on account of the 69th Independence Day.
This follows a recommendation made by a committee headed by retired Supreme Court Judge Nimal Dissanayaka appointed by the Ministry of Justice.
The Nimal Dissanayaka Committee was appointed to review and report on death row prisoners and whether their death sentence be commuted to life imprisonment. Accordingly, the committee has recommended to spare the life of 60 prisoners who are on the death row and to commute the death sentence to life imprisonment effective from February 04.
Other members of the committee are Additional Solicitor General Wasantha M. Bandara, Professor of Social Sciences of the Colombo University, Siri Hettige, Specialist in Psychology, Dr. Niel Fernando, Senior Lecturer, Prof. of Criminology of the University of Sri Jayawardepura, Udaya Kumarasingha, Commissioner General of Prisons M.M.N.C. Dhanasinghe and former Commissioner General H.G. Dharmadasa.
The death row convicts will be considered for parole only after they served a minimum sentence of 20 years and their pleas for any relief will be referred to the parole board once in four years after that.
Former Justice Minister Rauff Hakeem also appointed a committee headed by Justice G.W. Edussuriya retired Judge of the Court of Appeal to make recommendations for the Commutation of the death sentence to life imprisonments.

## Title: COPA recommends tax declaration from all citizens

COPA recommends tax declaration from all citizens
	
The Committee On Public Accounts (COPA), in its 2016 report proposes that there should be a mechanism to receive a declaration from every adult of the country to evaluate whether a personal income tax file should be opened or not in the light of the number of current personal income tax files of 1,35,170 and 13,169 of NGOs, Mutual Funds etc. may not reflect the actual state revenue situation.
Therefore, the interim report of the Parliamentary Oversight Committee recommends that there should be a mechanism to receive a declaration from each and every adult of the country to evaluate whether a personal income tax file should be opened or not.
If this is a difficult process to implement, the Committee felt that the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) should at least share the data with the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) since it was reported that there are over 6 million vehicles registered at present as there are no legal barriers to share the information with the Registrar of Motor Vehicles (RMV).
The newest COPA report that contains data of audit inquiries and accounts of all public institutions and semi government institution in 2015 and the first half of 2016 has been tabled in Parliament by the Chairman of the COPA, Deputy Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Lasantha Alagiyawanna.
With regard to the direct collection of VAT and NBT by IRD, the Committee notes that, in respect of commodities (goods), there is no proper nomenclature and classification system such as Harmonized System adopted by Customs and there is no proper valuation system such as World Trade Organization (WTO) Valuation System adopted by all over the world.
In the absence of such systems for commodity taxation, the Committee felt that it would lead to corrupt practices leading to loss of due revenue.
It was also reported that the number of VAT registered persons are 15,696 and VAT registered financial Institutions are 229. The Committee felt that these numbers may not reflect the actual situation. The Sub Committee therefore felt that the IRD should develop a suitable mechanism to recover the due VAT revenue to the government.
With regard to the Cooperate taxes also, the Committee felt that the current number of corporate tax files 47,154 may not reflect the actual position. The IRD should look into this by sharing information with the Department of Registration of Companies.
The Committee noted that the audit procedure of Declarations and Tax Files and investigation procedures should be looked into carefully to minimize revenue leakages by optimum use of appropriate available human resources, ICT and other resources.
At present IRD is in the process of implementing Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) with the assistance of Singapore Government. This project has started in July 2014 and the first phase would be completed in Sep. 2016 and the second phase to be completed by December 2016. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

CV has become a ghost: Dayasiri
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran had become nothing but a ghost, who instigated disharmony between the Tamil and Sinhala communities in the country, Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said today.
Addressing the weekly Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) media briefing, the Sports Minister requested Tamil people in the North to come forward against the Chief Ministers racist statements, which posed a threat to national harmony.
He said law makers couldnt come forward and speak of power devolution concerning the North, due to the racist statements made by the Chief Minister.
Wigneswaran is making statements which are harmful to national harmony, he said.
He is trying to convey a message to the international community saying that power devolution is not an option for Sri Lanka because of the Sinhala people. But the Chief Minister doesnt think about the harm he is causing to the country because of his statements, he said.
Mr. Wigneswaran has joined hands with the LTTE, its sympathizers and NGOs, to destroy the countrys harmony, Minister Jayasekara said.
Hence as Ministers we cannot come forward as people with backbones, because we have to think twice before making statements about power devolution, the Minister added. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Finance Ministry trying to bend laws for Negombo importer: Association
	
The Finance Ministry was trying to grant permission to a businessman to import 2,500 vehicles parts to be re-assembled here for three years, against the rules and regulation that govern importing of vehicles, Vehicle Importers Association said yesterday.
They said the permission had been given to a vehicle spare part importer in Negombo to import any type of vehicles from any country with a 70 per cent duty concession.
Also the Ministry has given permission to assemble the vehicles and to put them into the market. The proposal had been discussed in the Cabinet and it was not passed as two SLFP Ministers opposed it, a spokesman for the Association said.
However, the Finance Ministry is trying its best to pass the proposal in the Cabinet, he said.
This Government has introduced various duties and regulations, totalling 17 times, to discourage people from buying and importing vehicles, he said.
Meanwhile, eight containers of vehicle parts had been seized by the Customs yesterday and the Finance Ministry had allegedly directed the Customs to release the containers immediately, he said.
Finance Ministry sources said the Finance Ministry had requested the Customs to release the containers as the owner (Vehicle Lanka Private Limited) of the consignment had been a registered customer.
Vehicle Lanka Private Limited had been registered prior to imposition of new import regulations, while some other importers were not, he said.
His previous imports had been seized by the Customs and he had filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court and the Court had granted permission to release and register the vehicles, he added. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

WASHINGTON  The United States Senate confirms Rex Tillerson, former CEO of Exxon Mobil, to be President Donald Trump's secretary of state.
Senators voted 56-43 largely along party lines to approve Tillerson's nomination to be the nation's chief diplomat.
Most Senate Democrats opposed Tillerson's nomination, angering Republicans who considered the former Exxon Mobil CEO to be highly qualified for the post.
Sen. Ben Cardin, the Foreign Relations Committee's top Democrat, says he feared Tillerson would be a "yes man" and would not be able to prevent Trump from pursuing a misguided foreign policy that leads the country "on a march of folly."
But Republicans had the numbers to push Tillerson's nomination through. They got help from several Democrats who crossed party lines.
Tillerson's ties to Russia and his stand on sanctioning Moscow have been a point of contention.

GMOA threatens TU action over SAITM
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today threatened to resort to major trade union action next week if its demands with regard to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe were not addressed.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a media briefing that the GMOA took this decision following the unanimous approval of its Central Committee.
He said the GMOA would inform President Maithripala Sirisena and other relevant authorities to intervene in the matter in the coming days.
The Court of Appeal on Tuesday directed the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register medical degree holders of the SAITM. It was the result of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratnes irresponsible behaviour and his SAITM-biased stand, he alleged.
He said the timely need was to secure the patients' lives and added that the GMOA would stand to protect their lives at any cost. He also said nobody would prefer to get treated by a doctor whose standard was questionable.
He said the health minister should amend his attitude towards this matter; We will give a week's time to all these authorities to provide us with a solution. On the other hand, we have complete faith on the judicial system that it would not allow to legalize an institute which has being disapproved by the SLMC, he added.
Meanwhile, GMOA media spokesman Dr. Naveen de Soyza said discussions were ongoing among several internationally recognized institutes and the GMOA on this matter.
He said they would create a strong force to fight against this matter and added that discussions would be held with state university students, parents and several unions during this week. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

GSP+: EU P'ment urged to look into HR background
	
A number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) including the British Tamil Forum have urged the European Parliament to request a briefing from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on Sri Lanka before deciding on the GSP+ reinstatement.
According to Yahoo News, the British Tamils Forum (BTF), Swedish Tamils Forum (STF) and United States Tamil Political Action Council (USTPAC) have also called on the European Union Council and the European Parliament to take the full four months provided to thoroughly evaluate the GSP+ application.
On January 11, the European Commission recommended the reinstatement of GSP+ trade benefits to Sri Lanka.
The EU withdrew GSP+ benefits in 2010 in response to persistent human rights abuses. The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union now have up to four months to raise objections before benefits are reinstated.
BTF General Secretary Ravi Kumar said they respectfully disagreed with the European Commission's recommendation to reinstate GSP+.
"Recent reports from UN treaty monitoring bodies and UN Experts demonstrate that the government of Sri Lanka has not done enough to address serious human rights abuses. In December, the UN Committee Against Torture found that torture remains a 'common practice' by the police. This indicates a serious failure to implement the Convention Against Torture," he said.
The GSP+ is a conditional trade scheme based on both ratification and implementation of 27 conventions that relate to human rights, labour rights, environmental rights and good governance. Sri Lanka must follow these strict criteria to become a GSP+ beneficiary.
USTPAC President Dr. Karunyan Arulanantham urged the European Parliament to take the full four months to review Sri Lanka's GSP+ application.
"This will give the EU time to seek a briefing from the High Commissioner and obtain his in-depth knowledge of Sri Lanka's adherence to and shortcomings with the human rights conventions required under GSP+. The full four months will also provide the time needed to review the High Commissioner's report," he said.
High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein will present a report on Sri Lanka's human rights record at the 34th session of the Human Rights Council in March this year.

If allegations proved/Minister Harrison offers to resign
	
Rural Economic Affairs Minister P. Harrison said yesterday that he would resign from his ministerial portfolio and quit parliament if it was proved that the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) had swindled even five cents.
He made these remarks in response to allegations by the Joint Opposition that he was responsible for a loss of Rs. 10 billion to the State by allowing questionable deals to take place at the PMB.
At a media briefing, flanked by the PMB's chairman and general manager, the minister denied the allegations and said their lawyers would take legal action against MP Jayantha Samaraweera for making false allegations.
We are not willing to countenance false allegations. Our lawyers will take legal action next week and claim damages from the JO MP. Nevertheless, we urge the law enforcement authorities, including the Bribery Commission, to conduct inquiries into these allegations and give priority to them, he said.
He said the PMB had always acted in a transparent manner since the new government came to power, and that a colossal sum of Rs. eight billion belonging to the PMB had vanished during the last regime.
He said they had had to sell paddy at the low price of Rs.25 per kilogram, as no buyers had come forward and they were in dire need of clearing their storehouses to store the new harvest.
This is why we had to sell the paddy for animal feed. We needed to empty the storehouses to store the new harvest purchased from the farmers. This was done after obtaining Cabinet approval, he said.
The minister also denied that other ministers were behind the purchase of paddy at the low price for the production of animal feed.
There is no credibility in the JO MPs who accuse us. They are the ones who are corrupt. They have become millionaires quickly by entering politics, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The theme for 2017 Wetlands for Disaster Risk Reduction

World Wetlands Day is marked every year on February 2. This year, Sri Lanka will mark World Wetlands Day on a national level at Waters Edge with the participation of the Wildlife Conservation Department and the Central Environment Authority (CEA). On a provincial level, nine centres around Sri Lanka are conducting shramadana programmes, awareness campaigns and parades. The national event is held with the participation of Wildlife and Sustainable Development Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera as the chief guest. 
1971 February 2nd was the day the RAMSAR convention was signed. Since 1997, the RAMSAR Secretariat has provided outreach materials to help raise public awareness about the importance and value of wetlands. The standing committee of the RAMSAR Convention on Wetlands approved Wetlands for Disaster Risk Reduction as the theme for World Wetlands Day in 2017, during its 52nd meeting held in Gland, Switzerland from 13 - 17 June 2016.  This theme is selected to raise awareness and to highlight the vital roles of healthy wetlands, in reducing the impact of extreme events such as floods, droughts and cyclones on communities, and in helping to build resilience. 
Wetlands definition by World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
A wetland is a place where the land is covered by water, either salt, fresh or somewhere in between. Marshes and ponds, the edge of a lake or ocean, the delta at the mouth of a river, low-lying areas that frequently floodall of these are wetlands.
The destruction of wetlands is a major concern because they are some of the most productive habitats on the planet. They often support high concentrations of animalsincluding mammals, birds, fish and invertebratesand serve as nurseries for many of these species. Wetlands also support the cultivation of rice, a staple food in the diet of half the worlds population. And they provide a range of eco-system services that benefit humanity, including water filtration, storm protection, flood control and recreation.
Without wetlands, cities have to spend more money to treat water for their citizens while floods are more devastating to nearby communities. Storm surges from hurricanes can penetrate further inland, animals are displaced or die, and food supplies are disrupted, along with livelihoods. The WWF, governments and other organizations have pursued efforts to conserve and protect wetlands for more than 40 years through the RAMSAR Convention, the only international treaty devoted to a single eco-system type. More than 476,000 acres of wetland have been protected through this treaty, saving them and their services for future generations.
RAMSAR Definition
RAMSAR Convention define wetlands as: Areas of marsh, fen, peat land or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres.
What are wetlands 
A land area that is wet in a period of the year or throughout the year is considered a wetland. They can be verified under two main categories as natural wetlands and man-made wetlands. 
Natural wetlands
Those have been created that way by nature itself and they are again verified into three more categories as natural freshwater wetlands, natural brackish water wetlands and natural salt water wetlands. 
- Natural freshwater wetlands 
They are again divided into many categories including rivers and streams, flood plains, villus, fresh water swamp forests, fresh water swamps and peat lands. 
- Natural brackish water wetlands 
This type can also be divided into sub categories as mangrove eco - systems, salt marshes, brackish water, sea grass beds, lagoons, estuaries and deltas. 
- Natural salt water wetlands 
These include the coastal zone, shallow marine water, coral reefs, sea grass beds, sea algae beds as sub categories. 
Artificial wetlands
These are made by humans for their necessities. Some artificial wetlands are created by changing the natural environment. These are further sub categorized as artificial fresh water wetlands, irrigation tanks, reservoirs, canals, ponds, abandoned mining pits, agricultural wetlands (paddy fields), freshwater aquaculture ponds, constructed wetlands for waste water purification, artificial brackish water wetlands, prawn farms, artificial salt water wetlands and salterns. 

Like no other
Wetlands, and especially natural wetlands are extremely rich in bio - diversity as those lands are always filled with water, abundant food and habitat for flora and fauna. Coral reefs are considered highest in bio - diversity among all the eco - systems in the world. Animals like snails, flat worms, prawns and dragonflies need this kind of environment even in one stage of their lives. Reptiles, crocodiles, and most commonly birds, are seen in wetland habitats. Many migrating birds use wetlands as their food source and breeding grounds. Wetlands are crucial for the existence of fauna as many animals and almost all the bird species live in wet environments. These wetlands are rich in plants that contribute to maintain bio - diversity here; and certain plant and animal species called Point Endemic - that can be found only in a certain place in the whole world, (thus unique to Sri Lanka) have been discovered here. 
It is considered that 15% of Sri Lankan land consists of natural and man - made wetlands. Which are essential to our existence. Wetlands provide us with water, food (fruit, vegetable, grains and fish) fuel, firewood, medicine and means of employment such as tourism and material for employment. Wetlands are critical for our existence because they prevent floods by absorbing water in volumes and retaining it to be released in dry weather, to purify the unclean water by acting like a filter and absorbing many nutrients and pollutants. They also protect the coastline from erosion with a mangrove eco - system. 
Even though some wetlands seem solitary, all the wetlands are interconnected. Therefore if one wetland is being harmed, the other wetlands too, will also suffer. 
Way to destruction
Wetland eco-systems are threatened mostly by legal or illegal landfills - intended for agricultural practices and infrastructure, as building highways by filling wetlands and paddy fields. Hard waste and waste water in urban and semi - urban areas are released into marshlands and internal waterways that cause filling and pollution in wetland eco systems. Sometimes land is acquired by cutting down trees in wetlands. Over-use of abundant natural resources like sand and clay destroy the system as well as collecting plants and fish in their natural habitat for imports.
Intended human activities like introducing invasive fish and plant species contribute largely to changing the wetland environment; introducing rainbow trout fish to natural streams in the Horton plains is an example of the above fact. As a result of it, the other fish species were completely exterminated. Building reservoirs by disturbing rivers and making salt pans are also recognized as threats. 
Muthurajawela
Muthurajawela area is spread between Colombo from the south and Negombo in the north. It is a vast flat area consisting of four zones -- the lagoon, sanctuary, buffer zone and development zone. These zones are under the power of several governmental organizations. 
Water from a large catchment of the Dandugam Oya and another small water body called Kalu Oya flows to the marsh, and Kelani Ganga on the southern side flows through the Negombo lagoon and into the sea. Flooding is a natural incident in this system, and when the water levels in the lagoon rises and the surrounding settlements are flooded. 
It was once called the Supreme field of pearls due to the harvest produced by paddy fields there. Muthurajawela is home to many animal and plant species, some of which are rare or endemic. The total economic worth of the estuarine system is said to exceed 1000 million rupees annually. 
Muthurajawela has an important peat land area that can absorb a huge quantity of water in heavy rains, to be released as purified water in dry weather, which helps to keep a healthy ground water level, behaving like a natural sponge protecting both the environment and the people. Peat lands are said to store 90% of water compared to their soil capacity. Peat lands are twice richer in carbon than forests and if peat is burned by some kind of illegal activity, it adds to global warming by increasing the atmospheric carbon level. Building roads and constructing buildings, as well as illegal constructions and invasive species like Wel Anona are threats to this natural sponge called peat lands.

Muthurajawela should be protected
- Ajith Rodrigo,Director of Natural Resources Management of the Central Environment Authority
Muthurajawela buffer zone which is under the power of CEA, is one of five wetlands including Gregorys lake, the Talangama Tank, Walawewathth a - Wathurana wetland (fresh), and Bolgoda that are protected by the National Environment Act. It is a very crucial eco system for the urban environment. If there has not been this wetland to absorb extra flooding water, the urban areas would always get flooded. And it is high in bio diversity, that which is a home to many species. More awareness programmes should be held for protecting Muthurajawela. 

Using Wetlands for disaster risk reduction is crucial
-Dr. Jayampathy Samarakoon, Freelance Consultant to IUCN in Integrated Coastal Management

Muthurajawela area connects with the Negombo lagoon. It wasnt a pristine untouched area. It has been cultivated during the Kotte period and was subsequently cultivated during the Dutch period and cultivation was intensified under the British. Then the area was further developed by the Irrigation Department in the 1960s when there was a massive national effort to grow more food. When the Dutch established Colombo as the capital, this area was expected to be cultivated, to provide food for city dwellers. And then they constructed various canals to flush salt from the marshes and means of transportation. But it was unsuccessful. Before the Portuguese built the Hamilton canal as a transportation between Puttalam and Colombo, Muthurajawela was a fertile land with considerable paddy cultivation, with the canal fresh and salt water mixed and filling the paddy fields there. He described the background of Muthurajawela, as a person who has a sound knowledge on the subject. 
There was a master plan according to which the entire Muthurajawela area was carefully evaluated and divided into several zones. In 1984 a plan was formulated to fill the area with sea sand, yet huge protests took place and the plan was dismissed, he further noted.  In this special day of wetlands, using them for disaster risk reduction is crucial for most of the natural disasters, because global warming and climate change has made every natural disaster happen with greater intensity. Muthurajawela helps in absorbing a great deal of flood waters securing the surrounding land and settlements. There should be some kind of protection for still unprotected areas in Muthurajawela. Land fillings have had a very negative impact on Muthurajawela and therefore action should be taken to safeguard and control human activities there.

SA beat SL by 121 runs
	
Centuries from Faf du Plessis and David Miller helped South Africa thrash Sri Lanka by 121 runs in their second one-day international at Kingsmead on Wednesday.
Du Plessis' steady 105 was complemented by Miller's unbeaten 117 from 98 balls, which saw South Africa post 307 for six on a dry surface that took turn from early in the match.
"It's hard to single out which had a better knock, because they were both match-winning innings," de Villiers said in a television interview.
"I thought it was a 10 out of 10 batting performance."
In reply, Sri Lanka was bowled out for 186 inside 38 overs, as left-arm seamer Wayne Parnell struck twice up front and spinners Imran Tahir and JP Duminy also took two wickets apiece.
The result gave South Africa its 11th straight win on home soil, as well as a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.
It did find itself under pressure early on when it was put in to bat and slumped to 108 for four, but Du Plessis and Miller added 117 for the fifth wicket at a good rate.
Du Plessis was fortunate to be dropped on 63 at slip off the bowling of Lakshan Sandakan early in the partnership, but made the most of that break as he brought up his seventh ODI century.
The right-hander fell with eight overs remaining as he attempted to clear long-on, but Miller was dropped the very next ball and cashed in as he added a further 50 runs to his score from just 27 balls.
The left-hander went to his fourth one-day century at the start of the final over, and then hit two more sixes to finish with six maximums from the innings.
Although Sri Lanka started brightly in reply to South Africa's imposing total, with Niroshan Dickwella (25) and Upul Tharanga (26) taking the attack to the hosts, Parnell dismissed both openers in the space of four deliveries.
Kusal Mendis (20) and Dinesh Chandimal (36) also offered hope, but were equally responsible for throwing away promising starts.
Once they were dismissed, Sri Lanka's hopes evaporated and Duminy and Tahir ran through the tail.(newindianexpress)

Trump picks Neil Gorsuch as nominee for Supreme Court
	

Donald Trump has nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, seizing an unusual early opportunity to put conservatives back in the majority on Americas top court. 
In a primetime address late Tuesday that was part jurisprudence, part reality show, Trump tapped the 49-year-old appeals court judge from Denver, Colorado. 
If confirmed by the Senate, he will fill the seat made vacant by the death of Antonin Scalia nearly a year ago and tilt the balance of the court five-to-four in conservatives favour. 
The elegant, silver-haired jurist with a flair for writing incisive rulings is the youngest nominee in a generation. 
His appointment could have a major impact on cases ranging from business regulation to gender rights to gun control. 
After unprecedented hyping of the announcement, Trump invited Gorsuch and his wife to emerge dramatically before an audience in the East Room of the White House.

Here they come. Here they come. So was that a surprise Was it said Trump, ever the showman. 
He could have had any job at any law firm for any amount of money, but what he wanted to do with his career was to be a judge, to write decisions, and to make an impact by upholding our laws and our Constitution,Trump said. 
Despite the razzmatazz, Gorsuch was a remarkably orthodox pick for a president who has scythed through norms and precedent during his brief time in office. 
Like Scalia, Gorsuch is considered an originalist -- guided in his legal thinking by the constitutions original intent and meaning.

Woman ends up in the ER after her pet snake got stuck in her earlobe
	
Daily Mail/31 January 2017- Ashley was playing with her snake without her plugs in her stretched lobes when he decided to pop his head through the gaping hole. 
But then, what began as a funny moment between owner and pet quickly turned into a problem when it became clear that Bart was too big to fit all the way through. 
When Ashley realized that there was no way for her to safely extract her pet from her earlobe, she headed to the ER. 
While waiting in the doctors office, Ashley snapped an incredible image illustrating her predicament, and shared it on Facebook. 
Luckily, the doctors would have better luck sorting out the situation than Ashley did on her own. They numbed up my ear and used string to pull and stretch it out more so that they could get him out without hurting him, Ashley explained in the comments of her post.
