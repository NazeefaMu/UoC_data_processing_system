Dual citizenship: Udaya asks Immigration Dept. for MPs details
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP, Udaya Gammanpila today requested the Controller of Immigration and Emigration to furnish the details of the parliamentarians who held dual citizenship.
He had attached a list of MPs in his letter to the Controller asking whether any of them were dual citizens as at August 17, 2015.
?When applying for a passport, the applicant has to mention whether he is a dual citizen. The MPs' passport and identity card numbers could be obtained from Parliament,? Mr. Gammanpila said and added that the people had a right to know whether there were any MPs who were disqualified from holding that title.
He said he is submitting the letter based on the Right to Information (RTI) Act and that withholding of information or providing false information were punishable offences according to Clause 39 of the Act.
The Court of Appeal last Wednesday ruled that Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe was disqualified from functioning as an MP as she held dual citizenship in Sri Lanka and Switzerland. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

European Union Ambassador in Colombo, Tung-Lai Margue said he hoped his colleagues in the Member States and in the European Parliament would soon indicate their willingness to grant the GSP plus facility to Sri Lanka.
In his European Day message he said, ?Two years ago, after the election of a government with a commitment and vision to make fundamental reforms, Sri Lanka and the European Union reset our relationship and renewed our cooperation, broadening our political dialogue to cover a wide range of topics, from fisheries exports to trade, from agriculture to climate change, as well as often difficult and sensitive topics such as national reconciliation, good governance, human rights and the rule of law.
He said Sri Lanka's renewed commitment to respecting international rule of law and upholding its international human rights, labour rights and environmental obligations had resulted in the European Commission recommending the reinstatement of GSP Plus.
?Getting there took many hours of intense collaboration between Sri Lanka and the EU, as together we examined Sri Lanka's compliance with the 27 international conventions on which the GSP+ assessment is based,? he said.

France decides between Le Pen and Macron
	
?
After a tumultuous election campaign filled with scandal and surprises, French voters will decide on Sunday whether a pro-European Union centrist or an anti-EU, anti-immigration far-rightist will lead them for the next five years. ??
Opinion polls indicate they will pick Emmanuel Macron, a 39-year-old ex-economy minister who wants to bridge the left-right divide, resisting an anti-establishment tide that has seen Britons vote to leave the EU and Americans choose Donald Trump as U.S. president. ?But should an upset occur and National Front candidate Marine Le Pen win, the very future of the EU could be on the line. Macron, who wants to deregulate the economy and deepen EU integration, has a 23-26 percentage point lead over Le Pen in the opinion polls. ??
Forecasts proved to be accurate for the presidential election?s first round last month and markets have climbed in response to Macron?s widening lead over his rival after a bitter debate on Wednesday. ??
In a campaign that has seen favourites drop out of the race one after the other, Le Pen, who wants to close borders, ditch the euro currency and clamp down on migration, is nevertheless closer to elected power than the far right has ever been in Western Europe since?
World War Two. Even if opinion polls prove accurate and France elects its youngest president ever rather than its first female leader, Macron himself has said he expects no honeymoon period.

French election: Macron defeats Le Pen to become president
	
Centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron has decisively won the French presidential election, defeating far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.
Mr Macron won by 66.06% to 33.94% to become, at 39, the country's youngest president.
Mr Macron will also become the first president from outside the two traditional main parties since the modern republic's foundation in 1958.
He said that a new page was being turned in French history.
"I want it to be a page of hope and renewed trust," he said.
Mr Macron said he had heard "the rage, anxiety and doubt that a lot of you have expressed" and vowed to spend his five years in office "fighting the forces of division that undermine France".
He said he would "guarantee the unity of the nation and... defend and protect Europe."
Mr Macron's supporters gathered in their thousands to celebrate outside the Louvre museum in central Paris and their new president later joined them.
In his speech to the crowd, he said: "Tonight you won, France won. Everyone told us it was impossible, but they don't know France."
But he repeated a number of times that the task facing him and the country was enormous.
He said: "We have the strength, the energy and the will - and we will not give in to fear."
His mention of Ms Le Pen drew loud boos, and he said he would do all he could to ensure in future there would be no reason to vote for extremism.
Security remains tight in the capital and there were reports of police firing tear gas at several hundred anti-capitalist protesters near the M?nilmontant metro in the 20th arrondissement.
In her speech, she thanked the estimated 11 million people who had voted for her. She said the election had shown a division between "patriots and globalists" and called for the emergence of a new political force.
Ms Le Pen said her National Front party needed to renew itself and that she would start the "deep transformation of our movement", vowing to lead it into upcoming parliamentary elections.
She also said she had wished Mr Macron success in tackling the "huge challenges" facing him.

The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) said today it would file an intervenient petition in the court case filed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) against the Appeal Court ruling in favour of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
GMOA Assistant Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that the GMOA would resort to further legal action against SAITM if their agitation campaign did not succeed.
He said the GMOA had sent a letter to Labour Minister John Seneviratne drawing his attention to Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne's threats to suppress trade union action.
?We have also written to the Country Director of the International Labour Organisation regarding the threats issued against the GMOA by Minister Senaratne at the United National Party (UNP) May Day rally,? Dr. Aluthge said.
He alleged that SAITM continued to function illegally and that the GMOA was continuing this battle to safeguard the health sector and the rights of patients.
Dr. Aluthge said the GMOA Central Committee would meet today in Colombo to decide on the date for an indefinite strike action against SAITM because the government had failed to provide them with a reasonable response on this matter. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Harin urges PM for new mechanism
	
Minister of Digital Technology Development Harin Fernando on Saturday urged Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to create a mechanism for the ministers representing various districts to work for their people of the electorate independently.
" If we want to do something for the people in a particular district, we have to go to the Chief Minister in the Provincial Council. If some work is done it is considered as development work done by the Provincial Council. In the case of the Uva Provincial Council, the SLFP gets the credit for the work initiated by us," he said.
" I used to return empty handed in the past whenever I visited Dambulla when I was in the Opposition and it is the same situation now and I am ashamed of it" he added.
He told the party activists that they should understand that the Opposition cannot come back to power. " I know that our party cannot lose elections again but one should remember that the Opposition will not be able to regain power. I will not call the May Day rally of the joint opposition, a success as it was a hoax. High turn-out of a crowd at a rally does not guarantee electoral victories. The former president thought he was going to win the last presidential election because there was a heavy multitude of people for his rallies. However he ultimately lost the election," the minister said. (Yohan Perera Palitha Ariyawansa and Prasad Rukmal)

Keeping Traditions Alive
	
?Sri Lanka Girl Guides? Association?s ?Aththammage Kusalatha Tharagaya? ?
For the centenary year of the Sri Lanka Girl Guides? Association, the guides have many events lined up in order to uplift their girls and members of society. One such event, ?Aththammage Kusalatha Tharagaya?, was held on Saturday, April 29. Guides from all nine provinces joined here at the Polhena Walawwa in Rathambale where they took part in many competitions, from pounding paddy to making watalappan to drawing rangoli. The guides were exposed to various traditions carried out by their ancestors.The day was marked not just to commemorate the services of those who came before but also to celebrate the SLGGA?s most illustrious Girl Guide, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Former Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.
?This is the centenary year of the Girl Guides and this is the second event we have organized in order to commemorate this year. We began our celebrations three years ago under the tag line ?A 1000 Days to a 100 Years?, where we held daily activities, starting off with the organization of Child Safety Week, where we had child-safety specific themes on each of the seven days. The Girl Guides Movement is a low-cost, high benefit movement, supported by many dignitaries all over the country,? said the Deputy Chief Commissioner of the SLGGA, Visaka Tillekeratne. Describing the day?s activities, Ms. Tillekeratne said the aim of the event was to look back on traditions and keep them alive in a progressive way. ?Today we have Guides from all nine provinces and they have a draw to determine what competition they will take part in. So a Sinhala girl might have to make watalappan and a Tamil girl might have to make kokis and a Muslim girl might have to make modhaham. Through this, the girls will be more aware of each other?s cultures and this will create harmony, which is one of our main policies as Girl Guides.?
Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga?
?
Mahiya Abdul Rafoor, Director of the Differently-able Branch of the SLGGA spoke to us about how the association did its best to integrate the differently-able into as many of their activities as possible. ?We are planning on having a similar event with them in a more comfortable environment. We try to give them the same experiences by conducting such events in a more accommodating environment.?
The Daily Mirror was also able to get some insight from Guides at the event.?
?We take part in many interesting activities at the Girl Guides. We?ve gone on hikes and camps and in order to earn badges, we are given different challenges. Everything is really fun and we learn so much.?
We have learned to cook, sew and wash our own clothes. We conduct many social service visits to elders? homes and to outstation places. At an event like this we can learn about the traditional foods and activities of various Sri Lankan cultures,? said Tashiya Stefanie, 17, from Sapugaskanda Vishaka ?Balika Vidyalaya.
?
"This is the centenary year of the Girl Guides and this is the second event we have organized in order to commemorate this year"
?
?We learn how to face life in general. In these camps, we learned to cook, look after ourselves and gain leadership skills. We also do a lot of community service in the Guides. This event is important because we get to learn about how things were done in the past before technology and before everything was ready-made. We can also learn about our roots and about people from other ethnicities,? said Yadhusha Raweendram, 14, and Isuri Chandrasiri, 14, from Lyceum International School.
Addressing the crowd, Yasmin Raheem, Chief Commissioner of the SLGGA said, ?On March 21, 2017 the SLGGA celebrated 100 years of excellence in the leadership of girls and women. The work of the SLGGA is designed and implemented by volunteer members.?
The fact that this volunteer-based movement has sustained itself for a 100 years is not only a call for celebration but also for reflection. We should look back on our strong traditions and move forward into the new century progressively.
?Taking all of this into account, this inter-provincial challenge competition was organized by the Girl Guides and Guide leaders who have the knowledge, experience and expertise of Sri Lanka?s multi-ethnic traditional practices of harmony and peace.??
Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Former President of Sri Lanka and Chairperson of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation was the Chief Guest at the event. She started off her speech by speaking about how her mother was part of the SLGGA and how she used the qualities she learnt from being a Girl Guide throughout her life.?
?My mother, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, was a Girl Guide from the time of her schooling at St. Bridget?s Convent. Even then, the SLGGA was very active. She was also a ranger and head of the rangers before she left school.?
Afterwards I?m not sure what she did with the Association. But because I know of the activities of the Girl Guides, I can imagine how she got involved with them, to train them and contribute to the association and become an active part of it.
?Looking at her life, I can imagine how she was inspired by the Guides. She had many skills; at home she saw to it that the house was clean and she would train us as well. She would make cakes, kavum, traditional foods and upcountry foods and sweetmeats. She also knew how to embroider. As a lady she was well-mannered and well-spoken. ?Even as leader of the country she used the training she received as a Girl Guide. ?She would not raise her voice like us and would stand by the decisions she made. She never let go of her qualities as a Girl Guide. She taught us how to live with dignity and to help and respect others. She was a strong and exemplary woman who never forgot what the Girl Guides taught her.?
Speaking of the event she said, ?There are girls from all parts of the country attending this event. This shows that the Girl Guides is a place where people pay no heed to race, colour or religion, and young girls and women can be united in peace and harmony. When you join the Girl Guides, you should have an open mind and set your thoughts and attitudes in such a way so you can cultivate all that you?re taught in order to become part of a respected?
generation of women.?

Issuing a statement, he said statements made by certain government politicians to the effect that it was Mr. Rajapaksa who filed the motion were false.
?We unreservedly reject that statement. Neither President Mahinda Rajapaksa nor the Presidential Secretariat nor the Defense Ministry filed any such motion. The case that is being referred to was filed by an NGO,? he said.
He said at a request made by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the then Secretary of Defence Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had gone to see her at her residence and after a discussion with her chief security officer, provided her with the personnel and necessary facilities.
Despite the court ruling, no change was made in her security arrangements and the requests made by her chief security officer at various times, were always met, he said.

SLFP ministers to seek Rajitha's removal today
	
A group of Cabinet Ministers representing the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will meet President Maithripala Sirisena today and request him to remove Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne from the post of co-Cabinet spokesman, it is learnt.
These ministers met at the residence of Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera the other day. In his place, they are going to propose that Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa be appointed to the post. Mr. Yapa held this post during the time of the previous government.
Those who were at the meeting included Ministers John Seneviratne, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Nimal Siripala de Silva and Dilan Perera.
Dr. Senaratne and Mr. Seneviratne locked horns over remarks made at a Cabinet briefing that Minister Sarath Fonseka would be assigned to deal with emergency situations triggered by trade union actions. Dr. Senaratne cited this as a decision by the Cabinet whereas Mr. Seneviratne denied the fact. This led to a verbal clash between the two in public.(Kelum Bandara)

StanChart lead manages record oversubscribed int?l bond issue for Sri Lanka
	
Standard Chartered has successfully priced a US $ 1.5 billion 10-year fixed rate senior unsecured 144A/Reg S issuance for Sri Lanka. This marks the sovereign?s 11th US dollar benchmark offering in the international bond markets since 2007 and reflects the continued international institutional support for Sri Lanka through the years.?
Standard Chartered Chief Executive Officer Jim McCabe commenting on the deal said, ?We are honoured to be a lead arranger for the government?s international bond issue. Roadshows conducted by the team in the US, UK, Middle East and Asia helped build up market momentum and have brought in over US $ 11 billion in orders from a record 500 investors. The transaction priced well inside the initial price guidance of 6.625 percent area, represents a price tightening of 42.5bps. This is the maximum price tightening ever achieved by a Sri Lankan issuer.?
While the market was still anxious about the US non-farm payroll data later in the week and the result of the French elections over the weekend, the positivity created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announcement was clearly reflected in the strong orderbook. The orders grew swiftly, with books garnering strong demand from institutional investors in Asia and were fully covered in the first couple of hours. Investor interest from quality accounts allowed the bookrunners to indicate an aggressive final price guidance of 6.25 percent (+/-5bp) and the deal was successfully valued at the tighter end of final price guidance at 6.20 percent.?
Standard Chartered Head of Financial Institutions Lakshan Goonetilleke stated, ?The transaction was extremely well timed. The Central Bank took advantage of a window of opportunity post the announcement of the staff-level agreement with the IMF and just before the French elections, when the investors were looking to buy strong emerging market bonds. The seven-time oversubscription reflects the confidence investors have in Sri Lanka and its long-term prospects.?
Sri Lanka is rapidly consolidating its status as a country on the rise, characterised by considerable growth, an increasingly diversified economy, a stable political climate and an improving institutional and government framework. The country is currently in the process of reform via its commitment to the IMF?s EFF programme.?
The government is taking decisive action to correct the current imbalances, reduce liquidity pressure, catalyze investment and drive sustainable fiscal consolidation. The Sri Lankan economy grew considerably by 4.4 percent in 2016, whilst remaining within mid-single digit inflation levels, a considerable feat when compared to other emerging market economies.
Standard Chartered continues to remain a dominant player in Asia and has lead managed all the international issuances by the Government of Sri Lanka since 2014, evidencing the bank?s strong relationship founded on continuous engagement and a committed local presence.?

Thrust into silence by fate
	
Fate has always been said to turn life upside down and lead one on wild and unexpected journeys, creating turmoil and trouble along the way. Ashoke was one such victim who fell prey to a cruel joke of fate. Children are the most treasured assets in a parent?s life. Ashoke B. Gamage (2463) and his wife,Y. Jayanthimala were overjoyed to hear that they were going to be parents to quadruplets. Little did they know that a series of unfortunate events were in store for them. On December 9, 2003, Jayanthimala gave birth at a local hospital, not to quadruplets as expected, but to twins. Unfortunately, the third baby had a still birth and the fourth baby was never born at all. This was not the end of their misery, however.
Their second born, Akindhu B. Gamage was placed in an incubator due to him being underweight. What was unusual was that he contracted meningitis during his incubation. After having been given the vaccination against meningitis, Akindhu?s eighth cranial nerve-the auditory nerve-was damaged, which led to bilateral hearing loss. Ashoke believes that this unfortunate event was the aftermath of an overdose of the vaccination. While other babies could dose off to the lullabies sung by their parents, Akindhu had to fall asleep to nothing but complete silence.

"My job alone cannot bear the expenses of my son?s education, operation and monthly expenses. The operation itself costs Rs.3.6 million"
?
Akindhu (2478, 2469) became a patient suffering from bilateral hearing loss during the first few years of his life. In April 9, 2007, he underwent surgery for the first time for a cochlear implant to revive hearing in his right ear. But fate had always played games with Akindhu and this time was no different. The cochlear implant device installed during the first surgery had become deactivated with time and a second surgery was called for. Left with no other option but to undergo surgery again to repair the cochlear implant, Akindhu faced surgery for the second time on the April 11, 2011. Both surgeries were performed at Lanka hospitals. Now a third surgery is at hand to revive hearing in Akindhu?s left ear, which is also to be conducted at Lanka hospitals under Dr. Devanand Jha, Consultant ENT Surgeon. The second surgery took a toll on Ashoke?s finances.
Having paid for the previous surgeries with the greatest difficulty, Ashoke has been left helpless and unable to raise money for his son?s surgery which is required urgently. ?My job alone cannot bear the expenses of my son?s education, operation and monthly expenses. The operation itself costs Rs. 3.6 million. This is why I?m relating my story to the kind public because I?m desperately in need of assistance?, said Ashoke with eyes full of tears. Ashoke is currently employed as a management assistant at the Ministry of Health at the Medical Supplies division of Colombo. Ashoke beseeches the public to make his dream of Akindhu regaining his hearing a reality. It isn?t just the expenses of the surgery that are a burden. In addition to the surgery, the cochlear implant system that Akindhu currently uses to hear through his right ear, the freedom processing unit and the N5 processing unit are in need of renewal and replacement of accessories, which would call for about Rs.238,100. If not replaced soon, Akindhu faces the possibility of losing hearing in his right ear again.

"I?m skilled in the field of photography and video and ?want to train my son to be the best in these fields too. But I haven?t got the equipment to train him. My son is quite talented. He has also won first place in an all-island art competition on a previous occasion"
Akindhu B. Gamage?
?
On top of all these expenses, Akindhu?s monthly training in speech therapy which helps him identify and learn different sounds demands Rs.16,000 monthly. Since all these expenses are at hand, Ashoke had no option but to turn to the public, requesting financial assistance. ?No matter how many obstacles and barriers have been thrust his way, Ashoke does not feel discouraged. They say idle hands are the devil?s handiwork and not wanting to completely rely on donations, he is determined to create an additional source of income to provide financial stability to pay for his son?s expenses. So he requests a grant from appropriate companies that would allow him to sell DVDs on Buddhism that display different religious places in India and Sri Lanka, explaining their religious significance in relation to Lord Buddha as well as educational software that educates the user on the English language. In the hope of creating a stable future for his son, Ashoke had been planning to train Akindhu to follow a career in the field of photography. That hope was also shattered as Ashoke was forced to sell his photography equipment to bear expenses of Akindhu?s previous surgeries. ?I?m skilled in the field of photography and video and ?want to train my son to be the best in these fields too. But I haven?t got the equipment to train him. My son is quite talented. He has also won first place in an all-island art competition on a previous occasion??
He holds a bank account under the name Ashoke B. Gamage at the Seylan bank, Borella branch, Colombo 8, bearing the account number 082001964396-101, swift code-SEYBLKLX and telephone-0775035666/0775086535. As a father, Ashoke?s attempts to try to create a brighter tomorrow for Akindhu are commendable. He directs his details for further enquiries and information, in the hope of finding a generous donor willing to lend him a helping hand.

Trump?s travel ban back in US courts next week as battles stretch on
	
?
HINDUSTAN TIMES, 07th MAY, 2017- Legal challenges to President Donald Trump?s temporary travel ban on people from some Muslim-majority countries heat up again next week when two US appeals courts consider whether it is constitutional.
The legal fights may end up at the U.S. Supreme Court perhaps in the fall, many months after Trump first issued an executive order in January saying there was an urgent need to halt some immigration to the United States for 90 days while officials reviewed the visa process.

We were harassed by Digambaram's supporters: CWC
	
The Ceylon Workers' Congress (CWC) is accusing its rival political parties of attempting to take political advantage of Indian Prime Minister Modi?s visit to the estate sector, CWC vice president and Central Provincial Councillor Kanapathy Kanagaraj told a news briefing.
The Indian government has spent Rs.5 billion for the construction of a new building complex for the Hatton Base Hospital to be inaugurated by Mr. Modi during his visit on May 12. He is scheduled to address the estate workers at Norwood grounds. The CWC said it had received invitations from the Indian High Commissioner's office to attend these events.
It said when CWC leaders including provincial council minister Senthil Thondaman were on their way to inspect the grounds and see about the arrangements, their vehicle in which they were travelling had been obstructed by Minister Palani Digambaram and his supporters who are alleged to have threatened the CWC members saying they had no right to attend the opening or the meeting.
Mr. Kanagaraj said the CWC had lodged a complaint at the Hatton Police station.
When contacted, Mr. Digambaram said the Indian Premier is visiting the estates on an invitation extended to him by the Tamil Progressive Alliance and the functions connected have all been organized by his ministry and everybody is free to attend the events. But he said the CWC supporters had no moral right to enter the grounds where the function was to be held and create a stir.
The CWC claims that it is their right to visit the grounds where the Indian leader is supposed to address the crowds to check the facilities being provided for their members who would attend.
