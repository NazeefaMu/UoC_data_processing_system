Govt. in secret agreement with ADB: ICEU
	
Government has got into a secret agreement with the Asian Development Bank (ADB ) and with a US company to prepare a white paper to expand investment of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) on the Colombo Stock Exchange and on corporate Bonds by the year 2025, Inter Company Employees Union (ICEU) charged today.
President of the Union Wasantha Samarasinghe told a media briefing that increase of EPF investment on capital market instruments is a condition that has been laid down by the ADB for a $300 million loan it had pledged to the government of Sri Lanka.
Mr. Samarasinghe charged that government had already got $ 125 million out of the $300 million loan that has been pledged by the ADB.
The condition that has been laid down by the ADB and for which the government of Sri Lanka had agreed is to use EPF for the planned expansion of capital markets by the year 2025, Mr. Samarasinghe said.
It has also been planned to increase the EPF investments on the Colombo Stock Exchange, he added.
Mr. Samarasinghe said investing EPF funds on the Colombo Stock Exchange is not a healthy move in the wake of market manipulation that is taking place at the moment. EPF had lost Rs 2.8 billion as a result of investing in Colombo Stock Exchange in 2008 and therefore the investing more on the Stock Exchange and other capital market instruments will put the fund in jeopardy, Mr Samarasinghe said.
He also charged that the initial discussions on this agreement had taken place during the last regime and the present regime had continued it and had even stuck a deal with ADB in 2016. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: Norochcholai Coal Power Plant could affect Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi: Ecologist

Norochcholai Coal Power Plant could affect Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi: Ecologist
	
The toxic acids evaporated from the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant could pose a threat to the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, the oldest living tree of the world with a written history, Ecologist Dr. Ranil Senanayake said today.
Addressing a press conference organized by the Centre for Human Rights and Research (CHR), he said there is a possibility of clouds with toxic acid deposits travelling towards Anuradhapura where the sacred Bo tree (Fig tree) is standing, with the Southwest monsoon condition developing.
He said when coal is burned, Sulfur (S), Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen oxide (NO) is emitted and heavy metal particles also released. These elements form acids such as Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and Nitric acid (HNO3) which would reach the clouds through condensation.
Dr. Senanayake said the condition had already affected the trees in the outskirts of the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant leading to grave environmental damages.
He said that it can be observed that leaves of the tall trees have turned yellowish due to the emissions of these gases.
The unfortunate situation is that these clouds containing toxic acids travel towards Anuradhapura District. These clouds spread up to a radius of 6 to 6.5 km. The sacred Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is within the range of these clouds and could pose a threat to it too, he said.
In addition, he said a acidic condition is also spreading towards the sea areas as a result. Therefore, rebuilding such harmful coal power plants in future is a threat to the Eco-system.
Dr. Senanayake added that politicians and the officials had sacrificed one of the most revered Buddhist places worship for mere political gains.
CHR Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon and former Director (Alternative Energy) of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Engineer P. G. Joseph participated in the event. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

People attend first OMP meeting despite scepticism
	
The first outreach meeting of the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) was held in Mannar on Saturday and many people had engaged in the meeting despite scepticism, OMP Chairman Saliya Pieris PC said today.
The OMP Chairman said the meeting which was attended by about 250 people was held at the Mannar District Secretariat convened by the District Secretary.
All seven Commissioners of the OMP attended the meeting. The idea of the meeting was to share our plans with the family members of the disappeared and also to listen to their stories and ideas. Many of the families are sceptical whether the OMP can give them the answers and many of them probably expect quick results. unfortunately, the process of tracing the disappeared is a complicated process. However, it is encouraging to note that people participated in the meeting although many were sceptical. We told the people our plans. We are forming our 12 regional offices, eight in the North and East and four in the rest of the country, he told the Daily Mirror.
He said the families expressed concerns that they had gone after so many commissions and institutions. There were a lot of scepticism but we invited and told them that, despite their scepticism, to engage with the OMP and think of the OMP as one avenue that can be used to trace the missing and the disappeared, he said.
Elaborating more about the meeting, he said it was based more on sharing of ideas as an outreach meeting than an investigation.
This is the first of many OMP meeting to be held to reach out to the family members of the disappeared. What was noteworthy at the meeting was that there were so many stories to be shared, their versions of the stories and how their loved ones disappeared. What was admirable is the tenacity which they have pursued. One lady's son has disappeared in 1989. We saw the courage and tenacity of the people who came there, he said.
Mr. Pieris said the fact that the people were willing to participate despite their doubts were positive. We clarified their concerns and asked them to report to us if they feel threatened by participating in the meetings, as some people raised concerns to that effect, he said. The next OMP outreach meeting would be held in Matara on Saturday (19). (Lahiru Pothmulla)
