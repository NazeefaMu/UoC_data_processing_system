Bond issue: COPE Chairman wants phone details presented to Parliament
	
COPE Chairman and JVP MP, Sunil Hadunnetti yesterday requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to take steps to record in the hansard the details of the telephone conversations said to have taken place between some COPE members and PTL owner Arjun Aloysius, during COPE proceedings on the bond issue so that people would know what had been discussed.
He said it was unethical for COPE members to talk to a person under investigation over various allegations.
"It is unethical for them to talk a person directly involved in the bond issue. Talking to the ministry or Central Bank officials would not have mattered. The details of these telephone conversations should be divulged in Parliament," Mr. Handunnetti said.
He said it was an achievement to present the COPE report on the bond issue in Parliament despite such conspiracies, adding that anyone who reads the report would realise the interference they had while trying to present it in Parliament.
"I am so happy about my staff. Officials of the Attorney General's Department and Parliament rendered yeoman service in conducting investigations," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Conversation with Aloysius was in 2015: Rajakaruna
	
MP Harshana Rajakaruna told Parliament yesterday that his phone conversation with PTL owner Arjun Aloysius was in January 2015, long before he became a parliamentarian.
He said Mr. Aloysius was a family friend. "Mr. Aloysius' grandfather was a close friend of my father and they had known each other even before I was born. I have also known Mr. Aloysius since my childhood," the MP said.
He said as a COPE member, he had not discussed any matter pertaining to the investigations with Mr. Aloysius. "You have to forget friendships and relationships when you are a member of the COPE. This is why we all signed the COPE report and agreed with the recommendations made in it," the MP said and added that there was a sinister move to sling mud at the COPE members.
"These kinds of allegations might be made even against government members, because of the new political culture based on transparency, under the President and the Prime Minister. Therefore we are grateful to both of them for nurturing such a culture," the MP said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

FM fooled into giving tax relief to beer industry: Amarapura Vidwat Sangha Sabha
	
The Amarapura Vidwat Sangha Sabha said yesterday that Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera had been fooled into giving tax concessions to the beer industry because of a study that was based on fabricated data to please the tourism industry, .
In a press briefing, its Chief Registrar, Venerable Mawarale Bhaddhiya Thera, said that although the finance minister had reduced the tax on beer stating that it was a measure that was required to attract tourists, liquor was not a priority for tourists when choosing a travel destination.
The Thera said people in developed countries consume liquor in line with their religious patterns and several other social behavioural patterns. However it did not figure high on their agendas when they visit Sri Lanka as their main aim when they do so is for natural enrichment and the need to find a holiday that suits their budget.
Furthermore, the thera said the ministry had decided to reduce the tax on beer after taking into account the findings of a private research conducted by a lecturer of the Colombo University, one which the lecturer concerned had later recanted.
According to the minister the study conducted had shown that 49 per cent of Sri Lankans consumed Kassippu- a locally made illicit brew. This was later acknowledged as being incorrect and the Colombo University had denied that the study was conducted by them but was conducted privately. Based on the study Minister Samaraweera had taken a decision to reduce beer prices as he was misled by beer companies that fed him facts that were false, the thera stressed.
The thera also pointed out that only 20 per cent of the countrys population consumes Kassippu and only one per cent of the women population above the age of 15 consume liquor.
The thera also highlighted the fact that tobacco and liquor had been identified as the key contributors to the increase in non-communicable diseases and the alarming increase in domestic violence against women and child abuse.
The Thera therefore called upon President Maithripala Sirisena to step in and oppose the Finance Ministrys alleged move to cultivate alcoholics.We do not have faith in our Parliamentarians, however we still trust in our President and hope the countrys first citizen will intervene and save the country from becoming a nation of beer drinking alcoholics, the thera said.

Gintota situation under control, 19 arrested
	
The tense situation which occurred in Gintota last night is completely under control, with law and order being established in the area, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said today.
In a statement, he said that additional Police battalions, the Police Special Task Force, the Anti-riot Squad and the military were called in last night to bring the situation under control.
"Under the instructions of the President and the Prime Minister, curfew was imposed in the area from last night until 9 am this morning. I am aware that some political groups are now on a desperate mission to turn this minor brawl into a Sinhala-Muslim clash. I urge the public not to be misled by their false propaganda, he said.
He said the same elements were now in the process of disseminating false videos and news on social media platformss to stir up communal sentiments.
I reiterate that stern action will be taken against everyone attempting to resort to racist propaganda irrespective of their positions and political affiliations. The same will apply to the rumour-mongers trying to capitalise on this opportunity to achieve petty political gains," the Minister said.
The IGP has instructed the CID to identify the personnel who misuse social media to spread false news over the incident and to take stern action against them.
Meanwhile, police said that 19 suspects were arrested so far over the tense situation reported in the area yesterday.
Revealing the line of events which took place in the area leading to the violent incidents yesterday, Police Media Spokesperson Ruwan Gunasekara said the first incident had taken place on November 13, but it had no literal connection to the incidents that followed.
On November 13, a Muslim woman and her daughter were hit by a motorbike driven by a Sinhalese man. All three were injured and hospitalised. They were discharged after treatments and the issue was settled outside the Police as the bike rider had given Rs.25,000 as compensation to the woman and her daughter. Thereafter, bike rider was released on police bail, he said.
On Thursday, an attack had taken place in retaliation over the accident. However, no one with links to the accident was present at the scene which took place on Thursday in which one Muslim was injured, he said.
Later on, two houses owned by Sinhalese persons had been attacked and one Sinhalese individual had been injured. The chain of events had then escalated and was brought under control by Friday with the help of politicians and religious leaders.
However, another violent incident broke out last evening. As a result, the curfew was imposed, he said adding the situation was under control now.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Govt. attempting to establish 'Police state' - MR
	
Referring to the recent revelations on phone records at the Bond Commission, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday the government was attempting to establish a Police State by tapping phones.
He told the media outside the Welikada Prison that all phones were tapped and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the government should clarify this matter.
Mr. Rajapaksa said when considering what was happening now it was doubtful whether the phones of the Prime Minister and President Maithripala Sirisena were also tapped.
We thought that only the phone conversations of the opposition parties were tapped, but now it is evident that even government parliamentarians and ministers, members of the opposition, businessmen and lawyers are subjected to this treatment, he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said this could be regarded as a dangerous situation though some people may consider it a joke and the government was on a mission to collect information even though people could not understand it.
He said the Prime Minister should be summoned to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI).
Another important issue has arisen, where, while an investigation is pending in Parliament, the parliamentarians were reported to have to those involved in the bond issue. It is another question now, Mr. Rajapaksa said and added that it was evident they were listening to phone conversations which could be considered as a dangerous situation, and it was a threat to the privacy of the people.

Home and home battle over petitions
	
A home and home battle flared up in Parliament yesterday with regard to the filing of petitions against the delimitation gazette notification.
It began when Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera accused Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera of cslinging mud at the SLFP. "We are working on an agreement signed between the UNP and the SLFP and therefore we don't have underhand deals," he said.
The minister said Rajapaksa Kumara who is among six petitioners is a close associate of a former deputy minister. "I have agreed to field Rajapaksa as a candidate for the local government elections following many requests made by the party machinery," he said. "I managed to get the contact number of this person from CaFFE Chief Keerthi Tennnekoon and asked him why he signed the petition. He informed me that the former deputy minister asked him to sign it."
The deputy minister in response said he asked the question on the petitions after the statement made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in the House on Thursday. "Mr Rajapaksa said the government was trying to postpone the elections through various tactics. I was only responding to the allegation made by the former president and challenged the joint opposition to name those who are behind the filing of petitions. There was no under hand deals involved," he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Network of corrupt people behind bond issue: JVP
	
There is no one person behind the bond issue but apparently carried out by a network of corrupt persons including some MPs, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in Parliament yesterday.
He said there are other MPs other than the COPE members whose names had been disclosed.
"I agree with MP Karu Paranawithana who said there are others who had dealt with PTL owner Arjun Aloysius because a network comprising Central Bank officials, members of the business community and politicians. Information on this corrupt network will be disclosed soon," Mr Dissanayake said.
He said it was those who had dealings with Mr. Aloysius who created havoc at the COPE meetings and claimed that some COPE members had even threatened the Auditor General.
Mr. Dissanayake said the punishment meted out to those found guilty in this instance would be an example of how the government dealt with people involved in other financial frauds. "The Presidential Commission investigating into serious frauds has completed inquiries on 17 cases such as the fraud at the ITN, the opening ceremony of the Hambantota Port and the Avant Garde, but one wonders what the outcome will be," he said.

New legislation allows those in custody to talk to their lawyers
	
The government has drafted legislation to be presented in Parliament, providing for people in police custody to consult their lawyers at the respective police stations.
The Bill termed the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions - Amendment) Bill, if enacted, will enable an Attorney representing a person in police custody to meet his client, provided such a meeting does not affect the investigations being conducted in respect of the person in custody.
An attorney shall be permitted entry into such police station and shall be treated cordially and courteously, and be given a fair and patient hearing by the police officers attached to such police station, the Bill states.
It states that any such Attorney is entitled to meet the officer-in-charge of the police station and ascertain from him information pertaining to the alleged offence, the date, time and location of the arrest, and also the date, approximate time and about producing such person before a Magistrate.
However, such access can be delayed, if the officer-in-charge of the police station has reasonable grounds to believe that the exercise of such access may lead to destruction or interference with, or harm the evidence that is connected with the committing of a cognizable offence.
