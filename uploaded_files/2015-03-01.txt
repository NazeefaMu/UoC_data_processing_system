England 309/6 against SL
	
A century by Joe Root lifted England to 309 for six in its World Cup Pool A match against Sri Lanka, with some big hitting near the end helping to make amends for the slow progress during the middle stages of the innings.
Root?s 121 came off 108 balls and included 14 fours and two sixes.
England got off to a flying start in Wellington on Sunday thanks to some good early hitting by Ian Bell (49).

Parties representing ?Yahapalaya? fulfilled US needs: NFF
	
The National Freedom Front (NFF) today accused all the parties including JVP and JHU representing ?Yahapalanaya? to have fulfilled the American needs.
With reference to the comment made by US Secretary of State John Kerry, the NFF Media Spokesperson Mohammed Muzammil said that Kerry has said that the US was involvement on regime change in Sri Lanka. ?It clearly shows the influence on the ?Yahapalanaya government?, Muzammil charged.
According to Muzammil, TNA Leader R.Sambandan had also said that it was impossible for anybody to escape from war crimes charges and had said that the only method is to commit suicide for those who were involved in war crimes.
By taking these two statements into consideration, it is clear that the US played the main roll in regime change in Sri Lanka.
Further, they condemned the recording of statements from Former Navy Spokesman D. K. P. Dassanayake by the CID in connection with the alleged disappearances of several youths, Muzammil described it as the hunting of those who led the humanitarian mission towards victory.
?The so-called Yahapalanaya is performing what United States wants, but not the public. JVP is also staging another drama while collecting partisans into their politically bankrupt party. We are urging all the parties not to hoodwink the public like this,? Mohammed Muzammil added. (PF)

<U+200B>Suranga Lakmal fined for bowling beamers
	
	Sri Lanka fast bowler Suranga Lakmal was fined Sunday for firing two successive beamers at England's Jos Buttler, an action for which he showed "no remorse", the International Cricket Council said.
The incident happened in the 50th and final over of England's innings in their World Cup clash when Lakmal bowled a second consecutive high, full pitched ball to Buttler, after being given a first and final warning by on-field umpire Rod Tucker earlier during the same over
Lakmal was stopped from bowling at Wellington's Westpace Stadium and reported to the match referee David Boon for dangerous and unfair bowling.
He was also fined 30 percent of his match fee after pleading guilty to breaching rules that relate to "conduct contrary to the spirit of the game".
"While making my decision, I took into account that it is was dangerous and unfair bowling, there were no mitigating circumstances, and there was no remorse from the bowler," said former Australia batsman Boon.
Sri Lanka won the match by nine wickets, although Lakmal ended with expensive figures of one for 71 from 7.4 overs.
