<U+200B>Bribery Comm. allegedly split into factions
	
		 		 
		 
			
The Bribery Commission appears to have split into two factions following the resignation of one commissioner, informed sources said.
Though some officials hold the view that the commission?s functions can be carried out satisfactorily despite the resignation of the commissioner, another set of officials say otherwise.?
Following the enactment of the 19th Amendment, the vacancy left by the resignation can only be filled by the Constitutional Council (CC). It is learnt that it will take another two weeks to establish the Council. Till then the position will remain vacant -- affecting the commission?s activities.
According to legal experts, cases cannot be filed in a court of law by the Bribery Commission until all the vacancies are filled. (Sujith Hewajulige)

MR not invited for Remembrance Day
	
		The Ministry of Defence has not invited former president Mahinda Rajapaksa to the main Remembrance Day ceremonies organised by the Defence Ministry, Ranaviru Seva Authority Chairperson Anoma Fonseka said today.
		She told a news conference held at the Defence Ministry that as such Mr. Rajapaksa was not expected at tomorrow?s ceremony in Matara organised by the ministry and the one organised by the Ranaviru Seva Authority in Battaramulla on Wednesday (20).
		Meanwhile, a number of special programmes coinciding with Remembrance Day will be launched by the Ranaviru Seva Authority to uplift the living standards of war heroes and their family members.
		?Unlike in past few years, this year?s programme will give priority to war heroes and their family members. We should consider this as a priority. President Maithripala Sirisena will also meet them and talk to them,? Ms. Fonseka said.
		She said the monthly allowance of Rs.750 now being paid to parents of war heroes would be increased up to Rs.1,500 and an Elders Protection Centre with all facilities will be set up at Padukka for the elderly among them.
		?The Rs.12,000 scholarship allowance being paid to children of war heroes will be increased, cars instead of three-wheelers will be given to disabled war heroes and loans will be made available at low interest rates from state and non-state banks.
		Meanwhile, Ranaviru Seva Authority Vice President Upulangani Malagamuwa said, on a proposal by State Minister of Defence, Ruwan Wijewardene, a special card would be issued to members of the three Armed Forces, the Police and Civil Defence Force so that they would be eligible for more relief services.
		She said however, these steps would be further discussed by the various authorities and then submitted to parliament for approval.
		?Remembrance Day is set apart to remember those who had died and were disabled during the 30-year armed conflict. So, let?s make this day an occasion to pay them a worthy tribute,? Ms. Malagamuwa said. (Piyumi Fonseka)Pic by Pradeep Dilrukshana

<U+200B>Northern PC to pay tribute to war dead
	
		 		 
		 
			
Despite a ban on pro-LTTE commemorations in Mullaitivu District, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) ?controlled Northern Provincial Council (NPC) intends to have a function in the North today to pay to tribute to those who lost their lives, party officials said yesterday.
The NCP has organised this event. TNA MP Suresh Premachandran told Daily Mirror yesterday that the event was originally to be conducted in Mullaivaikkal, the area where the last battle was fought between the LTTE and the armed forces on May 18, 2009 ending three decades of war.
He said, the venue had to be changed following a court order that banned any form of LTTE commemoration in the area.
?The NCP is organising it. We will also participate in it to commemorate those who lost their lives,? he said.
Mr. Premachandran criticised the government for not allowing such functions.
?On the one hand, the government says that it will allow the Tamil people to have such commemorations. On the other hand, it prevents them from doing so through police action. This is duplicity,? he said.(Kelum Bandara)

Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said that police would report to the Mullaitivu Magistrate the remembrance function held in Wellamulliwaikal with the participation of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran.

The Mullaitivu Magistrate had on Saturday issued an order banning the holding of any pro-LTTE remembrance events in the Mullaitivu police division for 14 days starting May 18.
?We are still uncertain about the nature of the event and the motive with which it was held. The organisers said that it was held to remember their kith and kin who had fallen during the armed conflict. However, since there was a court order, we will report to Court so that it could take a final decision on the matter,? he said.?
He said the court order had also banned the holding of any pro-LTTE protest or procession but that no protest or procession had been held by the organisers today.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

They were charged with depositing three million US dollars in an account at Standard Chartered Bank and were then used to purchase shares in the Union Bank with the intention of laundering the money.
Mr. Karunanayake was charged with aiding and abetting a non-resident Sri Lankan Raj Rajaratnam of Galion Investments International, Master Prime Establishment to deposit the three million US dollars at the Standard Charted Bank Branch in Kirillopane without the authority of the Central Bank.
The other accused Nexia Corporation Services Limited and Linton Sirisome were indicted on charges of not following the usual procedure when carrying out a transaction via the Sierra account and depositing these funds in the Standard Chartered Bank.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe must take the responsibility for the controversial sale of Central Bank Bonds as long as Arjuna Mahendran holds the post of CB Governor, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He said the Anti-Corruption Committee headed by the Prime Minister was biased when it came to several incidents including the Bond sales, the floating armoury, Avant Garde and RADA.
?The ministers including me and Minister Rajitha Senaratne opposed the appointment of Mr. Mahendran but the Prime Minister said it was one of his decisions and he will handle it,? the minister said.
He said the United National Party (UNP) alone could not have helped President Maithripala Sirisena to win the presidency if not for the support of the JHU.
?But today the UNP behaves as if this is a UNP government,? he said. (LSP)
