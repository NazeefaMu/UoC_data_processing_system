Children: Our future citizens
	

Naturally everyone born in this society has to pass through a number of stages such as infancy, childhood, youth, middle age and the old age provided of course one remains alive without facing death immature. During the infancy and the feeble old age one has to depend on others for survival. Life circle is such that babies in the human world and the offspring in world of animals depend on their parents for survival.. Old and feeble grandmothers and grandfathers depend on their sons and daughters and grand children. If they are not kind enough on their part for the sake of the feeble lot one has to seek the assistance of social institutions such as homes for elders,
According to Buddhism birth is suffering, decay is suffering and death is suffering. One has also to suffer from ill health. This means that there is less suffering during childhood, youth and middle age. Childhood and the early young age are the periods when one prepares for worldly life. Children today are responsible citizens tomorrow. As such childhood is the prime period of ones life. 

Much needed preparation to be useful citizens in the future 
Childhood is the period of learning. Since children are future citizens of the world the fate of the future world depends much on what the children learn today. Member countries of the United Nations have affirmed their faith in fundamental human right, dignity and worth of a person and have determined to promote and better standards of living in an environment of larger freedom.
The United Nations has in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed that everyone in this world is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth therein, without distinction of any kind such as the age, race, colour, sex, language or other opinion , national or social origin, property, birth or other status

What the child needs most
The child by reason of his or her physical and mental maturity needs special safeguards and care including appropriate legal protection before and after birth. The United Nations General Assembly proclaims the rights of the child to the end that he or she may have a happy childhood and enjoy for his or her own good and for the good of the society the rights and freedoms and calls upon the parents, upon men and women, upon the voluntary organizations, local authorities and national governments to reorganize these rights and strive for their observation by legislative and other measures progressively taken in accordance with the declaration. 

The child by reason of his or her physical and mental maturity needs special safeguards and care including appropriate legal protection before and after birth

Entitlement of the child to rights without distinction or discrimination
Every child is entitled to these rights without distinction or discrimination on account of race, colour, sex, religion, political or other opinion national or social origin property, birth or other status whether of himself or herself or his or her family.
The child shall enjoy special protection and be given opportunities and facilities to enable him or her physically, mentally, morally spiritually and socially to live in a healthy and normal manner and conditions of freedom and dignity.
The child shall be entitled from his or her birth to a name and nationality and shall enjoy the benefits of social security. He/she shall be entitled to grow and develop in health. Special care and protection shall be provided both to him/her and his/her mother including prenatal care. The child shall be entitled to adequate nutrition, housing, recreation and medical services.

Care for physically and mentally handicapped children
There are children who are handicapped physically. There are deaf, blind and dumb children There are also deformed children sometimes without limbs and not able to move about. Further there are mentally handicapped children. Arrangements should be made to enable them to gain admission to special institutions such as schools for deaf and blind and their inherent rights for care, love and education etc. should not be denied to them.

Sri Lanka has been ranked high in the achievement of education in terms of high literacy

Children from underprivileged families
Further, there are socially handicapped children such as those from poor families. There are some other children who are socially marginalized for various reasons not due to any fault of their own but due to the reasons of being born to families not cared for by civilized society. Children are born to families with income below the average. Such children should not be denied their legitimate right to nutrition, love, care and education.
Society and the public authorities shall have the duty to extend particular care for children without families and for those without adequate means of support. A payment made by the State and other assistance towards the maintenance of children of large families is desirable. Family income can be considered as a criterion in granting scholarships.

Much needed love, affection understanding and recognition
The child is entitled to receive an education which will be free and compulsory at least in the elementary stages. He/she shall be given an education which will promote his/her general culture and enable him/her on a basis of equal opportunity to develop his/her abilities, his/her individual judgment and his/her sense of moral and social responsibility and to become a useful member of the society. 
The best interest of the child shall be the guiding principle. The responsibility of those responsible for his/her education and guidance lies in the first place with his/her parents.

Children who are deprived of their right to learn
It is true that the literacy rate of Sri Lanka is high when compared with the literacy rate of other countries in the region. However, a survey conducted by the department of Census and Statistics has disclosed the fact that six percent of the children in the school going age are not attending school. Some of them have just reached the school going age and presumably most of them will start schooling when once they find accommodation in schools. Twenty percent of these children or 1.2 per cent of the school going age have never gone to school and 4.8 percent of the children in the school going age or 80 per cent of those who are not going to school are dropouts.

Returners and Never Returners
A large number of students terminate their school education after taking up the G.C.E. (O.L) Examination. Some of them resume school education once when they pass the G.C.E. (O.L) Examination with grades sufficient to make them eligible to attend G.C.E.(A.L) classes. As such some children terminate school education permanently while others stay back temporarily.

Children who are deprived of preliminary education
About 83 percent of the children who never attend school are comprised of the five to eleven year age group which is the age of preliminary education. Majority of these types of children are found in the urban areas. Further the extremely poor parents especially in the remote areas cannot send their children to school because they need their assistance to look after the others younger to them while the parents work in places away from home. Further in certain remote areas there are no schools. Eighteen percent of the children belonging to the 05 to 11 year age group do not attend school due to their unsatisfactory health conditions and physical disability. 

Educational facilities for children in Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka has been ranked high in the achievement of education in terms of high literacy, high level of primary school enrolment as well as gender parity rate in access to education and achievements. When compared with other countries in the region there are still unfortunate children who had never stepped in to a school.
Sons and daughters of separated parents, pick pockets thugs, drug addicts, gamblers and beggars are often deprived of school education. Separated parents, especially when they are poverty stricken try to pass the responsibility to the opposite party and ultimately no one comes to the rescue of the children. Similarly robbers, gamblers and drug addicts take no interest in the education and well-being of the children. Beggars often train their children in the art of begging.
Physical education and recreation- All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
General Education should be supplemented by physical education. The child should have full opportunity for play and recreation which should be directed to same purposes as education. Society and the public authorities shall endeavour to promote the enjoyment of this right.

Protection against all forms of neglect, cruelty and exploitation
The child, in all circumstances should be among the first to receive protection and relief. The child shall be protected against all forms of neglect, cruelty and exploitation. Children of underprivileged, uneducated and uncivilized parents are vulnerable to neglect, cruelty and exploitation. Deficiencies, shortcomings, insufficiencies, stubbornness and other weak qualities in a child should not be regarded as causes for a child to be cornered, neglected. harassed or punished. Opportunities should be made available for such children to get over the difficulties and to correct themselves. Children should never be humiliated. The consequences of humiliating children can be explained by way of an illustration.

Overdoses of punishments
A teacher of a school who was also the warden of the boys hostel of that school had forced a student to eat all the food prepared for forty students as a punishment for early consumption of some food. The victim had to consume the food in the presence of the other students. The culprit went on eating seventeen Rotti when the assistant warden requested the chief warden to mitigate the punishment. The victim who was a fifth standard scholarship holder left the school and the hostel forever and it was the end of his school career.

Child soldiers  Proscription of children for offensive conflicts
The child should not be admitted to employment before the approved minimum age. He/she shall in no case be caused or permitted to engage in any occupation or employment which would prejudice his /her health or education or interfere with his/her physical, mental or moral development. It is not a secret that during the war Tiger terrorists had proscribed teenagers and even children below fifteen years of age as child soldiers in their military activities. In spite of warning by the international community Tiger Terrorists continued to destroy the blooming buds by proscribing them forcibly. 

How Buddha looks at the children
Children are investments being made for future use. According to Singalowada Sutta it is the responsibility of elders to bring up children well to be useful citizens in the future. Parents are expected to bring up their sons and daughters according to Brahaminic living imbued with four virtues of Metta (friendliness), Karuna (compassion),Mudita (satisfaction)and Upekkha (impassiveness)to prevent their children from committing acts of sin and violence, to direct them to the correct path, to educate them, to give them in marriage and to gift them the endowments in proper time. 

Duties and responsibilities of children
Children are expected to look after their parents during their old age, to respect them and to maintain the fame and prestige earned by their parents. Children should also win the hearts of other elders including the teachers and preachers. They should educate themselves and grow as useful citizens according to the wish of the parents, teachers and other elders.

China likely to build first LNG power plant
	
The government has decided to offer the contract to build the first-ever Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) power plant to China after India abandoned the construction of a 500 MWs LNG power plant on a decision of the Sri Lanka government.
The power plant will set up at Hambantota.
Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday inspected the site at Hambantota and said construction work would start in October.
The LNG power plant at Hambantota will be a joint venture among the governments of China and Sri Lanka and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) has been signed by the three stakeholders, he said.
The plant plant is expected to cost some US$400 million or Rs. 64 billion though the exact cost would only be determined after the feasibility study was completed,
India abandoned the Sampur LNG power plant in early 2017 after the Sri Lankan government decided not to go ahead with the two proposed Indian and Japanese-funded LNG power plants with a 500 MWs capacity each.
An agreement to set up a 500 MW coal power plant with Indian investment was signed in August 2011 and the construction agreement was finalized in October, 2013 as a joint venture between the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and India's Natural Thermal Power Corporation Ltd. (NTPC).
The agreement was later scrapped because of protests by the people in Trincomalee, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the anti-coal lobby. Sri Lanka then requested India to convert the coal power plant into an LNG powered power plant to which India agreed but warned of pitfalls in switching over from coal to LNG.
However, there was a heavy pressure from the CEB engineers union against the construction of an LNG power plant in Sampur.
The minister said the CEB however would give priority to set up environment-friendly green energy-powered power plants using solar and wind power.
He said 20 investors had been selected to set up 60 small-scale solar power plants of one MWs and the CEB would purchase power from them at Rs.12.73 a unit thus reducing the average price of a unit. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Dr H.S Perera He was a  gem of a person
	
The late Dr H.S Perera did a lot for Ananda College with the contributions he made to have a swimming pool for his Alma Matter standing out

It was with profound sadness that we Anandians learned the passing away of Dr H.S Perera, one of the greatest sons of Ananda College. Dr H.S departed from the world leaving a permanent void in the hearts of everyone associated with all activities of the college, including sports. He never missed schools big match even while he was studying for his FRCS in UK. His keen interest and efforts helped Ananda College to build one of the best swimming pools meeting international standards. But, he was not a good swimmer as far as I know. 
As soon as he was transferred to the Colombo General Hospital from Ratnapura, he was instrumental in forming the Old Anandians Sports Club (OSC), purely with the objective of raising funds for the swimming pool project. He later became the President of the OSC. The very first effort of the OSC was to invite wealthy businessmen and other well-wishers of the college to donate Rs 10,000 each and lay a foundation stone for the pool. 
My association with Dr H.S commenced during the time we organised a carnival at Vihara Mahadevi Park to raise funds for the swimming pool project. Throughout that period of organising the carnival, early in the morning, on his way to the hospital, he visited the Carnival site to check on the progress of the work. After finishing work at the hospital, he came direct to the school or to the carnival site and stayed till very late to see that everything was in order. If not for that dedication, those carnivals would not have been huge successes. 
The Ananda College swimming pool was the 22nd such facility in schools. All the other institutes (21) were non-Buddhist schools and had their own pools before Ananda. Then following a proposal made by Col. Para Molligoda, he initiated action to build a baby pool for the benefit of the Primary school students. Support given by Thilak Ediriweera and Wimal Wittachchi to administer the project work was a great strength and inspiration in completing this gigantic task. 
The success of this swimming pool project and getting the Primary School of Ananda back from the Asoka Junior School were major milestones that were passed. These successes were possible mainly due to the perseverance, high enthusiasm and dedication shown to the school by Dr. H.S by fellow old Anandians. His demise marks the end of an era of another devoted Anandian who treated his Alma Mater second only to their own mother. 
Even in his career as a top level Thoracic Surgeon, he was well-known for his kind and human attitudes towards his patients. He was one who never charged money for the operations performed at the General Hospital. I know of an instance when one wealthy Tamil gentleman wanted to give a monetary reward to Dr H S for saving the life of his mother. Dr. H.S kindly refused that monetary gratification despite repeated requests being made. Ultimately, when that person was pestering him to accept the reward saying that the reward is on behalf of his mother, Dr H.Ss request was for him to pay the gratification on behalf of his own mother to the swimming pool fund of Ananda College. 
He was courageous and objective in his endeavours and his heart was absolutely soft. He was a true gentleman and a devoted Buddhist. 
May he attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana.

First vote on embattled US court nominee begins
	

WASHINGTON AFP Sept28, 2018 -Brett Kavanaughs US Supreme Court nomination was expected to pass a first hurdle in the Senate Friday, a day after a dramatic hearing that saw the conservative judge fight off assault allegations recounted in harrowing detail by his accuser. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee began meeting early Friday and was expected to narrowly vote in favour of Donald Trumps pick after key Republican Jeff Flake said he would back the judge, whose nomination would swing the high court solidly to the right. 
Fridays vote -- set for 1:30 pm (1730 GMT) -- was taking place under an intense spotlight, following a historic day of testimony that put the toxic partisan feuding in Washington on full display. 
Kavanaughs nomination will then go to the full Senate, where Republicans hold a slim 51-49 edge. 
The countrys leading legal organization, the American Bar Association which initially proclaimed the conservative Kavanaugh highly qualified for the job, came out following the hearing urging a postponement until an FBI investigation could be carried out.  But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell insisted Trumps man would get a vote straight away in the Judiciary Committee. 
Democrats on the Senate committee expressed outrage and some walked out Friday morning after majority Republicans unanimously backed moving forward to a vote without further investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh.

Govt. will ensure war heroes honour and dignity: Prez
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said the government was fully committed to safeguarding the honour, dignity and respect of war heroes from the highest ranked generals to the ordinary soldier and they would be provided with all privileges.
He said this while addressing the Sri Lankans living in the United States in New York yesterday.
The President was warmly welcomed by the Sri Lankans comprising intellectuals, professionals, entrepreneurs, academics and university students.
He said there were some incidents war-time and post-war time incidents being investigated and they cannot be described as witch hunting.
The President said it should not be forgotten that one of the assurance given during the presidential election campaign was that these incidents should be investigations and those found guilty punished.
If there were incidents outside the theatre of war they should be brought before the law and such actions will not in anyway mitigate the sacrifices made by the war heroes. Our soldiers are internationally recognized because such mistakes have been rectified, he said.
The President pointed out that freedom and democracy were established in Sri Lanka and not a single journalist was attacked or compelled to leave the country during the past three and a half years.
"There have been some victories achieved by the government that are not so visible and the winning back the international support is one of them and that his visit to address the 73rd Session of the UN General assembly ensured the honour and respect for war heroes," he said.
The efforts made by the President in this regard was appreciated by the Sri Lankan community in the US. (SAJ)

Indian temple cant shut doors on women
	

Hindustan Times, New Delhi, Sep 28, 2018 - No woman can be stopped from entering Sabarimala temple, the Supreme Court ruled on Friday, ending a traditional ban on the entry of women between 10 and 50 years of age to the hilltop shrine in Kerala. 
Religion cant become a cover to exclude and deny basic right to worship... nor can physiology be a reason, the top courts five judge bench said in a 4:1 majority verdict. 
Women of reproductive age were restricted from entering the over 800-year-old shrine in south Keralas Pathanamthitta district as its presiding deity, Lord Ayyappa, is considered to be a celibate. 
The Supreme Court, which tested this traditional ban against the constitutional right to equality before law, had asked the temple board to establish that the restriction was an essential and integral part of religious faith. The court wasnt convinced with its arguments.

National Dengue Prevention Week: Dont let dengue mosquitoes sting us
	

The dengue pandemic is once again trying to penetrate our nation. However, The National Dengue Prevention Week campaign which commenced on September 26 is doing its utmost to eradicate and prevent the virus in Sri Lanka. The dengue prevention campaign is carried out jointly by the CMC, Health Ministry, Special Presidential Task Force, the Environment Police and the Tri-Forces. 
Consultant Community Physician of the National Dengue Control Unit, Dr. Preshila Samaraweera, spoke about the dengue prevention week, and the programmes which are conducted throughout the week, We conduct two national dengue control weeks every year. Usually it is conducted just before the monsoon period. When we see the pattern of dengue of patients throughout the year, there is a seasonal peak from May to July and October to January. The seasonal peak typically coincides with the South Western monsoon and the North Eastern monsoon. 
We conduct our sessions in various health divisions in our country which are called MOH areas (medical officer of health division). We have 355 MOHs in Sri Lanka. We categorize those MOH areas into three considering the density and probability of dengue in that region. The categories are: priority high risk, high risk and low risk. We have had 50 priority high risk MOH areas and 125 high risk areas. The other areas are low risk. During the week we conduct programmes in the priority high risk areas on all 7 days, and 5 days for the high risk areas. During this week we get the support from the tri-forces and the police to conduct the sessions. Such personnel are allocated into teams of three. Further within the MOH areas, we select high risk grama niladari divisions. Usually a grama niladari division consists of 500-700 houses. Each team is responsible for getting the cleaning of potential breeding cleared by respective households. The teams must visit and inspect every house, institute, school, constructive site hence any potential breeding places. Post inspection they ask people to remove unwanted water holding containers that promote breeding. The teams also educate the people of the area and help them identify breeding places. The respective PHI (public health officer) will inform the Grama niladari and religious leaders in order to have shramadanas to clean the areas. 

We conduct our sessions in various health divisions in our country which are called MOH areas (medical officer of health division). We have 355 MOHs in Sri Lanka

She noted that on September 28 that they have selected schools to be inspected. The education ministry has issued a circular to inspect and have a shramadana campaign in all the schools of the country. But the priority high risk area schools are inspected and cleaned with more attentiveness. 
She elaborated on the status of dengue in our country in contrast to the preceding years, she said, dengue has reduced significantly, from
150,000 (January- September 2017) to 38000 cases this year ( January- September 2018). 

Many factors have contributed to this reduction. When there is a large outbreak, the trend is normally that the following years will have a reduction in cases, because many people got the disease previous year. Every 5- 6 years we have a cyclical outbreak, due to zero type change. This is because the dengue virus has 4 types. For instance when we get an infection from the type 1 virus, we would not get the type 1 virus again. But, if a person, who has already contracted the type 1 virus and is later exposed to the type-2 virus they can contract the disease again. The significance of last year was that after 9 years the type 2 virus re-entered our country. Many people have not got exposed the type-2 virus, hence this facilitated the dengue outbreak last year. 
She also said that the reduction in cases is attributed to the actions taken by the health ministry, as they have allocated 1500 labourers this year to control the breeding of mosquitos and to carry out daily inspections of specified areas. Hence, every day waste such as coconut shells, salmon tins, buckets, tyres and empty containers are cleared by such personnel. Therefore, the number of breeding places in the country would reduce. 
She spoke about the dengue vaccine that was much discussed about in the previous years,  one of the vaccines is still under trial within our own country. There is another vaccine but the advisory commission has not accepted it in our country, because there is an issue in the Philippines regarding that vaccine. 
Speaking of dengue management in hospitals in our country she said, Usually in our country the fatality rate of dengue is very low, last year we had 186 000 dengue patients but 440 deaths. In our country we are managing dengue patients very well. It is up to the standard of other countries such as Singapore and Thailand. Such dengue riddled countries have got together and follow a similar dengue management guideline and treatment techniques. There is no specific drug however to cure dengue yet. 
In her concluding remarks she said,  In order to efficiently manage the dengue menance we must change the behaviour of the people in our country. We have to inculcate the behaviour of disposing waste. Then only can we substantially reduce dengue in Sri Lanka. To change this behavior and the culture of our people is a major challenge we face. We do many programmes with the education ministry to educate and spread awareness to children of proper waste management practices. We want waste management to become a natural habit. Further, clearing waste should be done on a daily basis and not only when an outbreak occurs. For instance, Some homes are quite vigilant when an outbreak occurs, but afterwards they begin to neglect waste in their homes. Therefore, the key to prevention of the epidemic is through environmental management. Some homes have bird baths, ponds and stagnant water in gutters that are heavily polluted. There must be a mechanisms to maintain them. As a further prevention mechanism chemicals are being used to destroy larvae and fogging is done to kill adult mosquitoes. However, we are trying to use chemicals at a minimum because such chemicals can cause resistance and it can also cause other diseases in people.

Ranjit Ella was an unassuming guy
	
The late Ranjith Ellepola was much loved by his schoolmates during his stay at Trinity College Kandy

Ranjith Ellepola was also known as Ranjit Ella or Ceeg Ella by his friends. He was my special buddy at Trinity College Kandy. His name was actually an honorific bestowed upon him for his remarkable ability to extend the breath of a cigarette far beyond its commercial life. Ranjit Ella was an unassuming guy who shunned the limelight. But he was always present at every escapade and on every unholy occasion. He was a humble man and a friend to all. He had no enemies. In our senior years, a few of us, took liberty from school and spent most of our afternoons at Gustaff. I am sure Ranjit you will see this, from the beautiful place you are in, and recollect the enjoyable times we had there and smile. It was a haven, a hideaway where we shared our lunch, indulged in a siesta or engaged in heated debate usually on very minor matters or simply gossiped and joked about anything and everything. Ranjit Ella contributed much to the bonhomie of the place and possessed an unparalleled native wit, coupled with an ability to deliver grounded advice. He was always ready to laugh.

Yet for all the life we had as boys and men and as husbands with family, when the maker cometh, we have no choice but to leave. Ceeg my friend there is deep, deep sorrow in your parting so young, but also joy in the knowledge that you will achieve Nibbana far sooner than any one of us. I make this statement considering your character and high values you possessed. You were a fine man, a fine husband to Sama and a fine father to Ayodhaya, Chulaka and Bahanuka. All of us, your friends, join to say a prayer for you and wish you a wonderful and peaceful life in the hereafter. 
Your friend

Commonwealth Secretary General Patricia Scotland has praised Sri Lankas progress in strengthening democracy and reconciliation, the government said today.
She has said the countrys resilience was greatly evident from restoration of normalcy quickly after Tsunami disaster in 2004 and many countries could take lessons from Sri Lankas success story.
When Dame Scotland called on President Maithripala Sirisena at the Loews Regency Hotel in New York on Friday, the President briefed her on the progress made in the last three and half years in reconciliation, strengthening democracy and restoration of human rights.
She said that in her recent visit to Sri Lanka she saw the positive developments taking place on all fronts and congratulated the President and the government. The President invited the Secretary General to pay another visit to Sri Lanka at her convenience.
President Sirisena said Sri Lanka considered eradication of illegal drugs and climate change as major challenges and asked the Commonwealth to expand activities in these areas as they would benefit most of the 57 member states.

Swaris did much in the name of The Bard
	
Oliver Swaris endeavours to promote Shakespeare in schools has been well supported the years

The boys and girls finals of the 45th Inter-school Shakespeare competition will conclude on September 29 (Today) at Bishops College Auditorium. The competition is organised by the Rotary Club of Colombo North and the Colombo YMCA. 
It is appropriate at this juncture to dig into the inception of this prestigious inter-school competition, initially held in 1951. In a felicitation penned by Attorney-at-Law Allen Wijeyekoon for the Inter-school Shakespeare Drama Competition, held on 12.06.1993, the writer says that the competition was the brainchild of Mr. Oliver Swaris of the Ceylon Thespians. He explains that it was a time when students were bored with Shakespeare while studying the prescribed text from the standpoint of the examination only. He adds that the introduction of the competition was a move to remove the play from the classroom and move it to the stage thus capturing the students love for both drama and Shakespeare. The education authorities thereafter did away with Shakespeare from the school curriculum, but the danger to Shakespeares memory was averted with Mr. Oliver Swaris proposal for a Shakespeare Competition which the Thespians conducted from 1951 onwards with Mr. Oliver Swaris as the Secretary.

The education authorities thereafter did away with Shakespeare from the school curriculum, but the danger to Shakespeares memory was averted with Mr. Oliver Swaris proposal for a Shakespeare Competition

But alas due to unforeseen circumstances the Thespians themselves could not continue with the competition for long and it went into abeyance until in 1973 the Colombo North Rotarians and the Y.M.C.A, led by Mr. Harold Peiris, and Mr. Alagan Kadiragamer, revived the competition with Mr. Oliver Swaris representing the Ceylon Thespians and editing the souvenir from 1979 onwards generously ensuring a complimentary copy of the souvenir to every member of the audience. Later Mr. Ariya Wickrama improved on the design of the souvenir in 1991 and 1992. In addition during that period Mr. Olive Swaris continued with the sponsoring of the competition for many years as drama had always taken first place in his life. To quote Ambassador Neville Kanakaratne His dedication to Shakespearean drama is worthy of the cause and the cause itself merits the unstinted support if all those who are committed to our countrys national well-being. 

Mr. Oliver Swaris had himself played the role of Ferdinand in the Tempest on the Thespian stage

Mr. Oliver Swaris had himself played the role of Ferdinand in the Tempest on the Thespian stage having taken time off during his student days for elocution under Rev. Edirisinghe and for ballroom dancing under Frank Harrison. He won many awards in both. He was a popular figure at social functions where his histrionic talents were greatly appreciated, the highlights being his singing and acting as Maurice Chevalier and his characterisation of Adolf Hitler and his classic performance as Dracula. He was a lawyer by profession having being admitted in 1950 as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of England and a member of the Company Law Commission on Business Names. His endeavours in promoting Shakespeare in schools were supported by his brothers Capt. J.H.B. Swaris, J.G.L.Swaris and J.B.C. Swaris, the latter two who adorned the bench in this country.

Tsunami tears through Indonesian city after 7.5 magnitude earthquake
	
Two-meter-high tsunami waves have crashed through an Indonesian coastal city after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck on Friday. 
A 6.1 magnitude quake struck Indonesias densely populated Sulawesi region on Friday morning, quickly followed by even fiercer 7.5 magnitude tremors which caused the tidal wave. 
Footage filmed in Palu, Indonesia and posted on Twitter, showed gigantic waves crashing ashore and flooding streets as people scrambled to get away. 
Houses have been swept away and people reported missing as the waves struck Palu and another city, Donggala - Indonesian disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho confirmed. 
Sutopo said communications with the area in central Sulawesi are down and the search and rescue effort is being hampered by darkness. 
The Indonesian government caused widespread confusion after issuing a tsunami alert on Friday afternoon, then quickly repealing at 5pm despite the tremors. 
Three hours later at 8pm local time a spokesman for Indonesias geophysics agency confirmed that a tsunami had in fact occurred. 
People in Central Sulawesi and West Sulawesi provinces were only then told to evacuate to higher ground. 
Sulawesi is the fourth largest Indonesian island and is home to around 18 million people - all of whom have been put on alert following the quake on Friday. 
The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the second quake at a strong 7.5, after first saying it was 7.7. 
An earlier 6.1 magnitude quake destroyed some houses, killing one person and injuring at least 10, authorities said.

UN must rescind resolution on SL: Prof. Jayasumana
	
Rajarata universitys senior lecturer Prof. Channa Jayasumana, who was in Geneva to counter the pro-LTTE Tamil diaspora, urged the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to rescind Resolution 30/1 on Sri Lanka.
Addressing the council earlier this week, he said the responsibility of Human Rights bodies and mechanisms was to ensure that humans rights were protected.
The professor said the LTTE resorted to terrorism to divide Sri Lanka on ethnic lines and it violated the rights of all communities but unfortunately, human rights champions remained silent.
He said, Now, these human rights bodies are working overtime to haul Sri Lankan military before international war crimes court. The Resolution 30/1 against us was based on an unsubstantiated OISL report which was full of contradictions and lies. Member states did not have chance to discuss and debate the resolution as Government of Sri Lanka co-sponsored it. The Darusman report which accused Sri Lanka of killing 40,000 civilians had been challenged by the International legal luminaries such as Sir Jeffry Nice and Rodney Dixon QC as well as Lord Naseby on the basis of wartime British High Commission dispatches from Colombo. You cannot ignore the urgent need for revisit the OISL report. Last year in March we submitted a comprehensive report to this council proving beyond any reasonable doubt that the charges leveled against us in the OISL report were all fabricated. Although you acknowledged the receipt you haven't responded to it. In March 2018 we challenged the October 2015 resolution, as it was co-sponsored by an individual without the proper approval. We request this council to discard the 30/1 Geneva Resolution against Sri Lanka.

## Title: War as seen by Sarajevos  child photographers

War as seen by Sarajevos  child photographers
	

In 1995, the Bosnian civil war which had torn apart former Yugoslavia was finally over. But the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo was in ruins. British photographer Chris Leslie who visited it in the late summer of 1996 was appalled. To him, the ruined city resembled a 20th century Dresden or Stalingrad. 
He visited the Bjelave orphanage, once described as the worst place in Sarajevo apart from the morgue, and decided to do what he could for the children in it. Both the orphanage and the children had suffered terribly, due to the war, and from neglect and abuse. 

Apart from children from the orphanage, there were some who lived in the neighbourhood.

Leslie did not try to do the usual charity work of feeding the orphans or finding them clothes or toys. Instead, he got support from Hope and Homes for Children, a charity working to eradicate orphanages worldwide by finding safe family and community bases for children, and from Post-Conflict Research Centre, a local NGO that promotes sustainable peace and the restoration of inter-ethnic relationships in Bosnia-Herzegovina. His project was focused on teaching photography to the children of Bjelave orphanage as a means of photographing their city as part of a healing process.
 
In 1997, he set up a dark room using donated equipment from Scotland and started a class in the orphanages basement. Due to language problems, the teaching had to be simple. The children ranged in age from 6 to 16. Leslies goal was to teach his wards how to use their cameras to photograph what they saw  the destruction around them, what was lost, the survivors, the people, the animals, attempts at re-building  anything which they thought was important enough to capture for posterity. 

Rina Trifkovic was abandoned as a baby in the orphanage. When the war started, she and 40 other children were evacuated to Germany

Apart from children from the orphanage, there were some who lived in the neighbourhood. Leslie ran the project for three consecutive years before putting one of his students, Edina Hrnjic, in charge. She ran it for one year. In 2013, Edina, her one-year-old son and her mother were killed in a car accident. A special exhibition of the orphanages photographs will be held in Sarajevo this year in her memory. This is what Edina said in 2011: Bosnia will survive as a country and Sarajevo will continue as a multicultural city, open to all. We have much work to do and there are still many divisions. But there is a new generation of young people born after the war who arent obsessed by it. We owe it to them to make it work. 
The child photographers are now adults and all have left the orphanage. Their lives are as fascinating diverse as their photographs are. Oggi Tomic, born with water in the brain and abandoned at birth, became a remarkable success story. Given just four months by doctors to live after his birth, he survived surgery and lived in several orphanages as a child. As the war became unbearable by 1993, he ran away to Sarajevo, by then besieged by Serbian forces. 
He managed to survive in an orphanage till 2004, when he was asked to leave. But he won a place to study documentary film and TV in the UK a few years later. He graduated with honours and now runs his own successful film and video production agency
in Cambridge. 
The story of Nusret is in stark contrast to Oggis. Both his parents were killed by a shell in 1992. He and his brother struggled to survive at the Bjelave orphanage as the Serbian army besieged Sarajevo. When he was 15, he and his brother were kicked out of the orphanage. Begging in the streets, his brother died of an overdose. Nuset managed to kick off the drug habit, get married and have a son. The child was taken from him by the authorities of Bjelave orphanage. But Nusrets son was killed by a fire which gutted the orphanage in 2007. Today, Nusret is sheltered by a local mosque, which he calls home, but is bitter about the orphanage. 
Muhamd Bosnjos mother was mentally ill and he was sheltered by the Bjelave orphanage after being abandoned when he was two months old. But, as staff fled or were sent to the frontline, the children were forced to beg or steal to survive. When Muhamed was eight, he was wounded by a shell. Two years later, he was captured by the Serbs and interrogated for months. He was later freed in a prisoner exchange. 
He later married and lived for a while in London before getting divorced. The British authorities sent him back to Bosnia. Today, he lives a tough life as a poorly-paid security guard in Sarajevo. Ten years ago, his mother committed suicide. On his off day, he always sits by the place where his mother died. 
The girls seem to have fared better. Dzenita Hodzic was 13 when she joined the photo project in 1998. Now, she is a physics teacher and professor of mathematics and computer science. Recalling that time, she says: I loved making the photos. I loved the darkroom smell. These are happy memories, because I am only choosing to remember good things from my childhood  I dont want to remember the bad things. 
Rina Trifkovic was abandoned as a baby in the orphanage. When the war started, she and 40 other children were evacuated to Germany. When the bus carrying the children made its way through the besieged capital, it came under sniper fire. Two children were killed, and several were taken off the bus at a Bosnian Serb militia checkpoint. 
Now 28, she says: Life in an orphanage seemed normal to me. It was all I knew  I didnt see the other side of life. I guess I missed the true love of parents, and then again I never knew what that was so I dont know how it feels. But what I am most proud of is that I am a self-made woman today. I have learned to depend on no one but me. 
In 1997, when the war ended, Rina and 30 other children were returned home to Sarajevo. 
Dina Dzihanic, now 31, joined the project in 1997 with her sister Amra. She lived in the same neighbourhood as Bjelave orphanage and frequently helped out with the younger children. Today she works in microfinance as a marketing manager. As a child, she says, her experiences of war had been better than what she know in peacetime. 
War was the norm and everyone was equal: No one had anything, she says. But after the war, as people returned they had nice clothes, nice school stuff. The years after the war we really struggled  we had to wear old clothes that were too small for us. These were the worst moments for me. (Source: The Guardian UK).

We are the bows  Children the living arrows
	
Sri Lanka celebrates World Childrens Day this weekend and on Monday October 1, though other countries have their celebrations on different days ranging from June 1 to November 20 when the day is celebrated by the United Nations and its affiliate the United Nations International, Childrens Emergency Fund (UNICEF).
According to UNICEF, this year the world is going blue and we need to build a world where every child is in school, safe from harm and can fulfil the childs full potential. World Childrens Day is a day for children, by children. It was on November 20 in 1959 that the UN General Assembly adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. It is also the date in 1989 when the General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Mothers and fathers, teachers, nurses and doctors, government leaders and civil society activists, religious and community elders, corporate bosses and media professionals as well as young people and children themselves could play an important part in making Universal Childrens Day relevant for their societies, communities and nations, the UN says. The day offers the people an inspirational entry-point to advocate, promote and celebrate childrens rights, translating into dialogues and actions that will build a better world for Children.
Last year UNICEF invited children from around the world to take over key roles in media, politics, business, sport and entertainment to voice their support for millions of their peers who are unschooled, unprotected and uprooted. From Auckland to Amman and from New York to NDjamena, UNICEF called on children to campaign in their schools and communities to help save childrens lives, fight for their rights and fulfil their potential.
In 1954 the General Assembly had called on all countries to institute a Universal Childrens Day, to be observed as a day of worldwide fraternity and understanding among children. It recommended that the Day was to be observed also as a day of activity devoted to promoting the ideals and objectives of the Charter and the welfare of the children of the world. The Assembly suggested to governments that the Day be observed on the date and in the way which each considers appropriate.
The Childrens Convention, which is the most widely ratified international human rights treaty, sets out a number of childrens rights including the right to life, to health, to education, to play, right to family life, to be protected from violence, to not be discriminated against and to have their views heard. 
On the basis of the Convention and joint effort by all the countries and regions, we need to promote and celebrate childrens rights on the Universal Childrens Day, and build up a friendly environment for children in the world through dialogue and actions.
In Sri Lanka, major events will be held from today to Monday to mark World Childrens Day. One of the main institutions involved in childrens rights is the wide powered National Child Protection Authority (NCPA). In a statement this year NCPA said it had initiated a programme to eliminate Corporal Punishment meted out to children in all settings. It said it hoped to sensitize principals and teachers on the contents of the circular relating to the right of the child to protection from corporal punishment.
Awareness Raising methods such as street-drama, interactive workshops and discussions are being used to create public opinion on this mode of cruel and degrading form of punishment.
NCPA has called on the people to inform it through its 24-hour child-line 1929 if children were being subjected to this type of institutionalized and systematic violence. It said a UN Child Rights Committee also had highlighted the need to combat corporal punishment in the home, in alternative care setting, in penal institutions, and also in schools.
Children are innocent and devastatingly honest. They tell the truth. That is why religious leaders have told us that they are close to divinity and those who harm children should be thrown into the deepest ocean with millstones tied around their necks. As the late UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon has said, education promotes equality and lifts people out of poverty. It teaches children how to become good citizens. Education is not just for a privileged few, it is for everyone. It is a fundamental human right.
