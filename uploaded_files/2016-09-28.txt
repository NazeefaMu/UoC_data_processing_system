A nexus between funeral oration and Police security withdrawal suspected
	
?
Some Government high-ups were highly perturbed over the former strongman being accorded the honour of delivering the funeral oration at the cremation of the late Anunayake Thera of the Ramanna Nikaya.
?
Airing the former strongman?s oration live over the state-run TV channel Rupavahini had caused them further chagrin.?
Later interested parties had made inquiries to find out the person who was so powerful as to give pride of place to the former strongman at an event at which even the yahapalanaya top brass were conspicuous by their absence.
Inquiries had revealed that a Buddhist monk residing in a Colombo 7 temple with close ties to the mass media was the livewire behind putting the former strongman in the limelight at the important event.
Following this discovery, Police security provided to the temple had been withdrawn, they say. The monk these days is said to be making discreet inquiries to find out who was behind the withdrawal of Police security to his temple. ?He also had vehemently denied having had anything to do with the funeral oration affair.?

Astrological snag stalls the launch of the new party
	
?
An astrological snag has stalled the launching of the proposed new political party by the JO group.
?
The loyalists of the former strongman had earlier taken a decision to take forward an already registered political party after re-naming it as ?Ape Sri Lanka Nidahas Peramuna? (Our Sri Lanka Freedom Front).
However, eminent local and Indian astrologers had pointed out that ?gana? (the vibrational pattern) of the name of this political party is highly inauspicious. Therefore, the job of coining a new name in place of ?Ape Sri Lanka Nidahas Peramuna? compatible with the birth constellations of the JO leadership had been entrusted to a committee of leading local astrologers. This committee is also required to get the name they agree upon approved by an eminent astrologer in India.
The formal announcement of the new name worked out by the committee was initially scheduled for this week, but it has been held back pending the approval by the Indian Jyotish Guru, they say.
The JO group has planned to announce the new name at a muharth most auspicious for their leader, the former strongman.?

Four months concessionary period to register motorcycles
	
Cabinet approval was received to grant a concessionary period of four months from October 2016 to January 2017 to register motorcycles that had not yet been registered or licensed by their owners to date, the Motor Traffic Department said today.
Addressing the media today Commissioner of the Department of Motor Traffic A.H.K. Jagath Chandrasiri said the four months concessionary period would begin on October 3 and be valid till January 3 to facilitate the owners of motorcycles who had still not registered their vehicles with at the Department of Motor Traffic.
?Most of the motorcycles had been imported directly without any documentation, and those motorcycles are being used without registering them with in the Department of Motor Traffic,? Mr. Chandrasiri said.
Meanwhile, the concessionary period of the three months that had been published from September 1 to December 31 this year is now operational to facilitate the vehicle uses who still had not handed in their vehicle ownership papers.
Taking into consideration the heavy fines that would have to be paid by vehicle owners who had open papers the government was trying to make it affordable for vehicle owners to transfer ownership by only paying double the sum charged for transferring ownership plus the revenue fees, Mr. Chandrasiri said.
The reason for this course of action has been the difficulties faced by law enforcement authorities as vehicles with open papers were being used by the new owners for long periods under the old owners? names which tended to become a problem when transferring the ownership to dependents if the event the owner of the vehicle dies.

Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa said today the biggest problem for the government was the extent of my grandmother?s land and not the hardships faced by the drought affected people in Hambantota and Polonnaruwa or the possibility of the IMF loan being turned down because of the failure to implement the VAT increase.
He told journalists after being present at the surveying of the land owned by Yoshitha Rajapaksa in Dehiwala yesterday adding that they would always respect Court orders.
?We will never evade court. At least one of our family members is summoned to Court every day under this good governance government. We have not done any wrong and we are not afraid to come to courts. We have faith in the court today just as in the past and hope justice will be meted out,? he said.
He said the government had done nothing since it took office other than exhuming bodies and surveying lands.
When asked about the delay in holding the Local Government election, Mr. Rajapaksa said the government had no confidence to face an election as it had done nothing for the people.
?We urge the government to hold the election if it was not afraid of elections. Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was blamed for holding elections. This government has not been able to resolve the burning issues of the people including those of farmers,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

A controversial head of a department responsible for civil security and law and order was the subject of a discussion held at a very high level recently.
?
A very high authority in yahapalanaya, the top team member presiding over the subject and several other authorities at the top level had participated in these deliberations.?
Informed sources say this departmental head has now squandered away the vast fund of goodwill he enjoyed at the time of his appointment to the coveted post. And a number of allegations now being made against him had received the serious attention of the top men at this discussion. His insolent attitude towards the top team member in charge of the subject, peculiar propensity to give lectures for hours, dereliction of duty and involvement in a dubious Kelani river-based project at Dompe are among the allegations he is facing now, they say. One of the participants had also recalled that even the Diyawanna boss had occasion to sound a note of warning to the departmental head quite recently.?
At the conclusion of the deliberations, the top brass had decided to issue the final warning to the controversial departmental head ? to mend his ways or to face the worst.

?
This story is about the exploits of a powerful politico belonging to the aforesaid category.?
A large shipment of ethanol consigned to a company owned by a close pal of this politico that had arrived in the city harbour was duly sent to a Customs warehouse recently. The Customs authorities who went into action found that the ethanol shipment worth about Rs.500 million had been imported without a valid permit. ?And the authorities as a matter of procedure slapped a hefty fine amounting to several millions of rupees on the consignee.
However, the businessman swung into quicker action; he contacted the friendly political authority and apprised him of the situation.?
The political bigwig lost no time giving an order to the Customs authorities to release the ethanol consignment after imposing a nominal fine! ??

Having arrived at their conclusions, they had met their leader, the former strongman for a discussion.
?
?Do you know the real numerical strength of the Blues in Diyawanna?? the former strongman had asked. After a pause, he himself had provided the answer: ?Only 82?
?How many genuine Green members are there in Diyawanna in your opinion?? he had asked again. ?As the JO members quietly looked on, their former boss had given the answer to this question too.
?The correct figure is the same: 82?
He continued: ?All others accounting for the balance in both parties are outsiders ? allies from other minor parties. Therefore, as regards, the de facto political strength, both main parties are in the same boat. The political reality of this situation is that those in power can go out of power at any moment Those out of power may come into power at any moment by the same token.?

There is absolutely no compulsion on timelines. Both sides should be at ease. Therefore let me reassure here that India looks forward to sign an agreement with Sri Lanka. We value that. It has to be done taking everybody on board, talking on every issue of concern for both sides with a great sense of ease,? the visiting minister said.

India, three more countries pull out of Islamabad SAARC Summit
	
After India said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not travel to Islamabad for the regional SAARC summit in November, three other members - Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Bhutan - have also pulled out of the meet, isolating host Pakistan.
The SAARC or South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit cannot take place even if one of the eight members withdraws.
According to NDTV, Bangladesh has communicated its inability to attend to current SAARC chair Nepal, saying, "The growing interference in the internal affairs of Bangladesh by one country has created an environment which is not conducive to the successful hosting of the 19th SAARC Summit in Islamabad in November 2016"
Bhutan too re-affirmed its commitment to regional cooperation, but said the recent escalation of terrorism in the region has "seriously compromised the environment for the successful holding" of the SAARC summit in Islamabad.
"The Royal Government of Bhutan shares the concerns of some of the member countries of SAARC on the deterioration of regional peace and security due to terrorism and joins them in conveying our inability to participate in the SAARC Summit, under the current circumstances," it said.
In a terse statement Afghanistan said, "Due to the increased level of violence and fighting as a result of imposed terrorism on Afghanistan, the President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani with his responsibilities as the Commander in Chief will be fully engaged, and will not be able to attend the Summit."
India has said "cross-border terror attacks" have created an environment that is "not conducive" for the meeting. Foreign ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup tweeted, "Regional cooperation and terror don't go together. India pulls out of SAARC Summit in Islamabad."
The decision is one in a series of key moves in India's global campaign to isolate Pakistan after four terrorists crossed the border into Kashmir and attacked an army base in Uri, killing 18 soldiers.

The subject of the proposed new Constitution came up for discussion at a high level conference held quite recently.
?
The Big Boss who is keen on fulfilling the pledge given to the people presented his views at the outset. ?
Most participants who spoke after their Boss, expressed the view that if they were to implement the Constitutional reforms designed to devolve powers further, as promised at the national elections, they would have to go in for a Referendum. And they would have no other alternative given the court ruling already delivered.
However, the Constitutional experts, eminent lawyers and veteran politicians who were among the participants were one in the opinion that holding a Referendum was a risky exercise for if they suffered defeat at it, it was a cinch that all their Constitutional reform plans would go haywire.?
After giving an attentive hearing to all the views, the Big Boss ruled that all proposed Constitutional amendments that required a mandate at a Referendum be dropped from their agenda.
Given this ruling by the Big Boss, the contours of all Constitutional reforms held out by the yahapalanaya leaders at the last national elections with much sound and fury will undergo a complete change, they say.?

SLC to slash player fees
	
The National cricketers are in for a substantial pay-cut in their contract fees as well as on match-fees as their paymaster - Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) prepares a performance based pay-packet for the ensuing year.
Instead, players will receive a significant increase in individual performance bonus and win bonus - a strategy the SLC is keen to implement to encourage better performances of players.
A SLC media statement on Sunday said that it would contract 100 players in all - 30 National and ?A? Team players who would be given central contracts, 20 youth players (emerging category), 25 state players (senior veterans) and 25 provincial players.
?Discussions among the players of all categories and officials of the SLC led by President, Thilanga Sumathipala took place on September 10 at the SLC Headquarters, and the contracts are due to be signed next week,? the
statement added.
The documents? has in possession reveal that SLC had disbursed a sum of Rs. 684.85 million among 16 National players from March 2015 to April 2016, around 33 per cent of? the Board?s annual income.
Out of the sixteen who received central contracts, nine players have received from anything over Rs. 40 million to Rs. 95 million.
These payments include contracts fees, match-fees, seniority payments, win bonus, prize monies, 10 per cent share of the ICC and ACC events, percentage of clothing and team sponsorship and individual performance bonuses.
Though SLC?s income is comparatively lower than those of affluent board?s like India and Australia, they have paid their cricketers handsomely on par with the international standard. For an instance, a Grade 1 cricketer in India was paid an annual contract fee of US $190,000, a Test match-fee of US $7,500, an ODI fee of US $4,500 and US $2,250 for a T20 match last seasons.? Australia offered an annual contract fee of Australian $ 900,000, a Test match fee of $ 14,000, an ODI fee of $ 7,000 and a T20 fee of $ 5,000 for all contracted players while the skipper earns 25 per cent more in his retainer fee as ?captains? bonus?.
A player in Sri Lanka?s top category received a contract fee of US $165,000, category 2 US $100,000, US $70,000 in category 3 and US $40,000 in category 4 during the 2015-2016 contract periods which ended in February.
In addition they were also paid a match fee of US $7,500 for a Test, US $3,000 for an ODI match? However, SLC?s decision is likely to spark a fresh revolt from the players given that they will suffer a substantial financial loss under the proposed performance based system.
In 2014, the Sri Lankan players refused to sign the new payment contracts as their demands of 20 per cent share from the income derived through ICC events haven?t been met by the Cricket Board.
However after a lengthy battle, the matter was settled after the SLC offered a flat fee for ICC Tournament participation and a further incentive payment, in response to the players? demands for a 20 per cent cut of the gross sum received by the SLC for global events. (Champika Fernando)

Amidst the much publicized moves by the JO group to form a new political party headed by the former strongman, there are reports about persistent efforts being made by a group of Betel leaf seniors to bring about a friendly understanding between the former strongman and the Compassionate one leading to the restoration of unity in the split Blue party.
?
These seniors complain that certain secretarial ones and some others hailing from the Rajarata and the central hills have become a big impediment to their peace moves. They charge that these office-bearers of the party would quash the progress of the months of reconciliatory efforts on their part with one single irresponsible public statement.
The group of party seniors having decided that enough is enough is planning to meet the Big Boss who is also the party chief to urge in one voice to take decisive action against those sabotaging their well-meant efforts to re-unite the party.?
The group armed with a district by district analysis of facts and figures also proposes to explain to the Big Boss the fate that awaits the party at a future election if it remains divided. ? ?
