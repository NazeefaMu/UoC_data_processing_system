Swindlers will be born as dogs: MS
	
According to the rock inscription found near the Sripada, believed to have been engraved during the time of King Nissanka Malla, those who stole State assets would be reborn as dogs and crows, President Maithripala Sirisena said on Wednesday.
Addressing a ceremony held to mark the 125th anniversary of the Archaeology Department in Colombo, he said that those in power should always keep in their mind that they should not steal State assets, and there would be consequences if they did so.
"I am asking how much this Nissanka Malla inscription is relevant to yesteryear and to today. I, as the first servant of the people, suggest that this edict be inscribed in a plaque and placed in all offices from that of the President, Ministers and government officials,? the President said.
Addressing the event held at the Department premises, the President said that the artefacts in the Department were the evidence of a nation's history.
?To build the nation and the country, we should not be confined only to speak of our proud history. All of us should totally commit ourselves to enrich future generations with the benefit of our proud history,? he said.
President Sirisena said he had received information about 42 high ranking positions at the Department of Archaeology remaining vacant during the past few years.
?The previous Government should be held responsible for the accusations against the Department of Archaeology during the last few years,? the President said.
He said as a new Government his administration would provide sufficient physical and human resources needed for the Department and would give the opportunity to move forward with the new technology.
President Sirisena offered floral tributes to the statue of the eminent archaeologist Senarath Paranavithana at the premises.
He also declared open the newly constructed Dhatu Mandiraya at the Department of Archaeology.
The President inaugurated the exhibition organised by the Department of Archaeology for exposition of King Dutugemunu relics and Archaeological artefacts.
During the ceremony ?Eda saha Ada? archaeological souvenir was presented to the President.
A stamp and a first day cover also presented to President Sirisena marking the 125th anniversary of the Department of Archaeology. A special memento too was presented to the President during the ceremony.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, several ministers and officials were also present. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Video: UPFA raps Ranil's DEW drop
	
Two senior UPFA members today denounced Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe?s comments on COPE Chairman D.E.W Gunasekera.
The response come following Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe?s charges on Tuesday (07) that former Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) D. E. W. Gunasekera had violated the Parliamentary Privileges Act by commenting on the COPE report on the Central Bank bond sale probe by COPE.
Mr. Gunasekara in a news conference last Friday made various comments with regard to the committee report on the sale of Central Bank bonds, which had run into a controversy.
Responding to Ranil Wickremesinghe?s criticism, UPFA member Prof. G.L. Peiris said Mr. Gunasekara performed a commendable task as COPE Chairman for the last five years and produced six reports, which were widely acclaimed by those in Parliament.
He said Mr. Gunasekara was praised by all including the Prime Minister. Based on COPE findings, he said, the Chairman of Government institutions and Statutory Boards were removed.
However, Prof. Peiris said Gunasekara had come under attack all of a sudden after his exposure of the report of the alleged Central Bank Bond sale controversy.
"We denounce it. It is an onslaught on the Parliamentary system," he said.
Meanwhile, UPFA member Bandula Gunawardane said Mr. Gunasekara had been recognised for his impartial qualities and therefore there was no point of accusing him of being biased, when probing the controversial Central Bank (CB) Bond sale.
?The accusation of the Prime Minister is yet another attempt to cover up the Bond scam, in which the country had lost over Rs. 56 billion,? he said.
?Mr. Gunasekara was made COPE Chairman unanimously because of his integrity. He even rejected me, when I asked for an opportunity to submit details on the issue,? Gunawardane told a news conference held at Abhayaramaya in Narahenpita yesterday.
He said the current government should be removed to prevent disasters in the banking system and many other sectors in the country.
?The government led by Mr. Wickremesinghe had only implemented policies, which are detrimental to the economy and democracy. That is why we need a government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

A true story about a Real Life Hero
	
When Ishan Rangajeewa originally convinced a young man to invest in a life insurance policy, little did he dream that his own life would change dramatically. ?
?The young man had very little money with him. ?In fact, he confessed he had not had breakfast or lunch that day and I suspected it was because he was trying to save. ?So I bought him his lunch and then persuaded him to become a life policyholder to make his future secure. He was uncertain about naming a beneficiary as he was not married. A colleague piped up and jokingly said to make him the beneficiary which in fact he had done,? recalled Rangajeewa.
The young man subsequently fell ill and died suddenly and tragically and only then did Rangajeewa find out that the young man had left his blind mother without any financial support. The fund due from his life cover would go to his friend instead of his mother who needed it more.?
Rangajeewa was quite upset at the thought. Going beyond his role as an insurance professional, Rangajeewa took it upon himself to help his customer?s mother. He approached the friend and succeeded in convincing him to give the benefit amount to the mother, which truly made a difference to her life. ?
His act of going beyond his call of duty to help the loved one of a customer saw Rangajeewa recognized as a ?Real Life Hero? in the AIA group. He was also recognized for his professionalism and for demonstrating concern for the wellbeing of those he served. ?
Out of the 15 regional winners who were nominated in the first round across Asia as an AIA Real Life Hero, Sri Lanka?s Ishan Rangajeewa from the Maharagama regional office was among the top six finalists. Rangajeewa?s heart-warming story will bring him recognition and honour in Hong Kong when the winners will be invited to participate in a special event that will showcase their heroic achievements later this year. The other winners are from Thailand, Korea, Singapore with two from Malaysia. ?
?Rangajeewa?s achievement is truly a cause for celebration,? said AIA Sri Lanka Deputy CEO Upul Wijesinghe.?
?Insurance is sometimes overlooked and not prioritized by many but the efforts of our wealth planners such as Rangajeewa reflect the value of the great service they perform for our society. This also illustrates the calibre of our wealth planners for whom insurance sales is not a mere job but a way of life that requires great commitment.?

CBK blocks Prasanna
	
	As of yesterday, the United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) members, chosen for candidacy, started signing their nomination papers. In most cases, the lists have been sorted out. But, a serious problem had arisen in the preparation of the Gampaha District list.
	Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has examined the list and expressed her strong objection to the inclusion of Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, Western Provincial Council Members Samanmali Sakalasuriya and Sahan Pradeep as candidates on the UPFA ticket.
	All these members were in the forefront in the campaign to bring back former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Ministerial candidate.
	Alongside, there was yet another reason for her to scorn nomination to Mr. Ranatunga. His two brothers- Arjuna Ranatunga and Ruwan Ranatunga- are also seeking nomination from the same district.
	They are, in fact, close aides of President Maithripala Sirisena.
	Mrs. Kumaratunga has come out with the excuse that nomination could not be given to three persons from the same family.
	It has led to discontent within the UPFA. Mr. Rajapaksa was fighting tooth and nail to make sure that Prasanna Ranatunga secures nomination.
	Some UPFA seniors opined that the matter could be sorted out within the next couple of days.
	MR to tender nomination today
	Despite the communiqu? by UPFA Secretary Susil Premajayantha that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would receive nomination, his supporters harboured doubts about a last minute attempt to block candidacy to him.
	In fact, Mrs. Kumaratunga, who served before Mr. Rajapaksa, reportedly berated President Maithripala Sirisena for agreeing to accommodate Mr. Rajapaksa at the behest of a faction of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), and other allies of the UPFA.
	A pall of uncertainty prevails in certain political circles that nomination would be denied to Mr. Rajapaksa at the end of the nomination period, placing him in a precarious political situation even being unable to consider fallback options.
	In an effort to pre-empt such attempts, the faction loyal to Mr. Rajapaksa, insisted that the nomination list of the UPFA should be handed over the election authorities at least by July 13, three days prior to the closing date.
	Normally, the main parties used to do it on the last day of the nomination period. But, the UPFA faction sought a clear departure from this traditional practice, apparently sensing possible mischief to prevent nomination.
	There is a bad precedent set in this regard in politics. At the 2010 General Election, the name of Uva Provincial Council Member Chaminda Janaka Tissakuttiarachchi had been altered with correction liquid from the United National Party (UNP) list of the Moneragala district, and replaced it with a new one, much to the dismay of the candidate concerned.
	Later, it became common knowledge that a powerful politician from the district had done it to prevent Mr. Tissakuttiarachchi from becoming a threat to him during the election campaign in vying for preferential votes.
	It is difficult to conclude whether the pro-Rajapaksa group fears such mischief this time.
	But, it has even advanced their date of choice for handing over nomination papers. It is learnt from the sources close to Mr. Rajapaksa that he would contest from the Kurunegala District.
	The nomination list for this district, is to be handed over to the Kurunegala Returning Office today.
	Accordingly, Mr. Rajapaksa, as the group leader of the Kurunegala district, will tender nomination today at the Kurunegala District Secretariat.
	SB, Arjuna still mount pressure against MR
	Former Parliamentarians S.B. Dissanayake and Arjuna Ranatunga are among those still objecting to nomination for Rajapaksa. They relentlessly keep pressure on the President to deny nomination.
	In the meantime, a group of SLFP MPs, who backed the President right from the beginning, complained to him about the inability to get nomination for some provincial council members such as Prasanna Solangarachchi.
	Ministers Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Deputy Minister Thilanga Sumathipala and others brought this to the notice of the President as well.
	CWC still undecided on Badulla
	Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC), led by former Minister Arumugan Thondaman, has decided to align with the UPFA to contest the election Ratnapura, Kegalle and Matale.
	However, the party has not given its final word regarding its plan for the Badulla district. The UPFA leaders await Mr. Thondaman?s word for the finalization of nomination lists.
	UNP ready for battle, be it with Mahinda or not
	While the UPFA is riddled with internal squabbles on the nomination lists, the UNP is set to position itself ahead of the election. The UNP leadership, it is learnt, has instructed the candidates to be geared up for campaigning, without being bothered about the presence of Mr. Rajapaksa in the campaign.
	Veena to appear on ballot paper after a decade
	Eelam People?s Democratic Party (EPDP), an ally of the UPFA, has decided to contest alone this time in the north and the east. The party will contest under its Veena Symbol for the first time after 2004.
	Since then, it has participated in elections under the betel symbol of the UPFA. But, party leader Douglas Devananda has decided to do otherwise due to the change of political landscape in the country.
	Hizbullah, Karuna , Pillaiyan in the same list
	M.L.A.M. Hizbullah has decided to contest the election on the UPFA ticket. Included in the same list are former LTTE military leader -turned -SLFP politician Vinayagamurthy Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman and another LTTE leader- turned- Eastern Province Chief Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan.
	Hizbullah said he would be the team leader of the Batticaloa district.
	?I will sign the nomination paper today,? he said. (Kelum Bandara)

ComBank in World?s Top 1000 Banks for 5th successive year
	
		 		 
		 
			
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has once again been ranked among the Top 1000 Banks of the World, in the prestigious rankings published annually by ?The Banker? magazine of the UK, becoming the only Sri Lankan bank to achieve this feat five years in a row.
The ranking is based on the Bank?s key performance indicators for FY 2014. Commercial Bank has moved up 39 places in the 2015 rankings.
The Top 1000 Banks of the World are ranked on the basis of Tier I capital, assets, capital assets ratio, pre-tax profits, return on capital, return on assets, BIS (Basel) Capital ratio, NPL to total loans, loans to assets ratio, risk weighted assets (RWA) to total assets (TA) ratio and cost income ratio.
The Top 1000 World Banks ranking is compiled from a database of over 5,000 of the world?s biggest banks and is acknowledged by the global financial community as the definitive guide to bank rankings and analysis. Begun in 1970, the ranking is widely used all year round by senior bankers, corporate treasurers, corporate financiers, the professional services community and many others in their day to day decisions relating to banking.
?Commercial Bank has always emphasised the importance of consistency in performance. We are therefore delighted to be the only Sri Lankan bank to make the Top 1000 rankings for five years consecutively,? said Jegan Durairatnam, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank. ?The conditions we operate in are challenging and changeable, so achieving KPIs that are on par with other leading international banks, reflects well on the strength and stability of the Bank.?
The top three positions in the 2015 ranking of the World?s Top 1000 Banks remain unchanged from the previous year, with ICBC (China), China Construction Bank and JP Morgan Chase & Co. (USA) ranked first, second and third respectively. Four of the top 10 banks are from China, four are from the USA, while the UK and Japan have one each in the top 10.
The Banker is published by Financial Times Business, which is the specialist publishing and conferences arm of the FT Group.
In the year reviewed for the 2015 rankings, Commercial Bank reported profit before tax of Rs 15.7 billion, a loan book of Rs 463.6 billion, deposits of Rs 529.4 billion, gross income of Rs 74.4 billion, assets of Rs 795.6 billion and Tier I Capital Adequacy Ratio of 12.93 percent.

	A new method of computation would be adopted in measuring the economic growth of the country, Deputy Minister of Policy Planning Dr. Harsha De Silva said today.
	He said that the actual economic growth (GDP) in 2014 had been 4.5 per cent, while it was 3.4 per cent in 2013.
	However, Dr. De Silva said he would not accuse anyone of misleading the public nor would he politicise the matter.
	He said the economic growth was reduced according to the new computation method as some informal sectors that had been included had not experienced a significant growth.
	?The country will follow the latest methodology used by many countries from now on in computing the economic growth,? he said.
	?Sri Lanka has actually updated itself with the changing world with the adoption of this modern and realistic method of computing the economic growth,? he said last morning.
	Dr. De Silva said that Cabinet approval had been obtained to move into the new method.
	Giving a short description of the new method he said the year 2010 will be taken as the base year according to this method. According to the old method the base year was 2002.
	He said a number of informal sectors of the economy would be taken into account when computing the economic growth according to the new method.
	He claimed that the actual economic growth (GDP) in 2014 had been 4.5 per cent, and 3.4 per cent in 2013.
	However, Dr. De Silva said he would not accuse anyone of lying or misleading the public.
	He said the economic growth was reduced according to the new computation method as some informal sectors that had been included had not experienced a significant growth.
	?I don?t accuse anyone of lying and do not expect to politicise this issue,? the Deputy Minister therefore said.
	He assured that there won?t be any changes in ratings and adjustments of risk profile of Sri Lanka and thereby said Sri Lanka would be able to obtain credit on concessionary interest rates. (Yohan Perera, Chaturanga Pradeep)

Ravi to report Hyatt project malpractices to FCID
	
	The finance ministry is to make a formal complaint to the Police Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) on the large scale misappropriation of funds and malpractices said to have taken place in the construction of the Hyatt Hotel projects in Colpetty and Hambantota during the last regime.

Fitch affirms 9 Lankan banks; downgrades Sampath
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings on nine of Sri Lanka?s banks, both state-owned and private banks.?
The long-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) on National Savings Bank and Bank of Ceylon (BoC) have been affirmed at ?BB-? and their national long-term ratings have been affirmed at ?AAA(lka)? and ?AA+(lka)?, respectively. Fitch has also affirmed the national long-term rating of People?s Bank at ?AA+(lka)?.
Fitch said the ratings reflect the ?extraordinary support? the banks get from the government of Sri Lanka and their systemic importance.?
?Their stable outlook mirrors the stable outlook on the sovereign?s rating,? Fitch said.
At the same time, Fitch has affirmed the long-term IDRs of DFCC Bank PLC at ?B+? and the national long-term ratings of DFCC and DFCC Vardhana Bank PLC at ?AA-(lka)?.?
National Development Bank PLC?s (NDB) national long-term rating was affirmed at ?AA-(lka)?.
Fitch also affirmed NDB?s long-term IDR at ?B+? and subsequently withdrew the rating due to commercial reasons.
Furthermore, Fitch has affirmed the national long-term rating of Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC (Commercial) at ?AA(lka)?, Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB) at ?AA-(lka)? and Seylan Bank PLC at ?A-(lka)?.
Fitch has downgraded the national long-term rating of Sampath Bank PLC to ?A+(lka)? from ?AA-(lka).
The downgrade of Sampath Bank?s national long-term rating reflects the weakening of its capitalisation relative to peers, which offset benefits from the growth of its franchise.
Fitch expects that this trend will continue as the bank is not likely to be able to sustain growth purely through retained earnings.?
The bank?s core capital ratio declined to 10.6 percent at end-March 2015 from 13.1 percent at end-December 2013. Its regulatory Tier 1 ratio also deteriorated to 8.3 percent from 10.1 percent over the same period while the Tier 1 ratio of its direct peers remained above 11 percent.?
?The weakening was mainly due to a shift in Sampath Bank?s loan book towards consumer and retail loans which carry a higher risk weight. Pawning advances, which were zero risk weighted, decreased to 6.6 percent of loans at end-March 2015 from 19.4 percent at end-2013.?
Fitch maintains a stable outlook for the Sri Lankan banking sector. This is because the sector credit profile is not likely to deteriorate materially even though there could be downside pressure on asset quality and profitability.?
The national long-term ratings of Seylan Bank reflects Fitch?s view that the state would provide it extraordinary support in case of need because the regulator has classified it as one of six domestic systemically important banks. Fitch assigns Seylan Bank a lower support-driven rating because it has a smaller market share compared with its larger peers.
Fitch considers Commercial Bank as the strongest bank in this peer group. Its rating captures its more measured risk appetite, solid franchise, sound track record and strong funding profile. The bank?s provision coverage has been improving and asset quality has remained satisfactory. The ratings reflect our expectation that its operations in Bangladesh will remain small.?
HNB?s rating reflects its strong franchise, satisfactory capitalisation, established track record and higher risk appetite compared to better-rated peers. Its senior debentures carry the same rating as they rank equal with other unsecured obligations.

Global Change Readiness Index 2015: Sri Lanka ranked first in South Asia
	
		 		 
		 
			
Sri Lanka has emerged as the country best equipped to respond to growing political, economic and social changes in the South Asian region, according to KPMG?s latest Global Change Readiness Index (CRI).
The CRI is the only global study of its kind, ranking 127 countries for their capacity to prepare for and respond to accelerating change brought about by everything from natural disasters and economic and political shocks, to long term trends such as demographics, and new technologies.
Sri Lanka which is in a year marked by political transition, was ranked 62nd among 127 countries globally and five places above neighboring India to top countries in the South Asian region. Sri Lanka has shown immense growth in terms of change; and has surpassed most of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets set for 2015, outperforming nearby country comparators on most MDGs.
Having brought a new president into office on a mandate for political and economic change in January, Sri Lanka emerged has a high growth market with inflation falling markedly, and the current account deficit narrowed. Since the civil war ended, growth during the past five years has been in the form of a peace dividend resulting from reconstruction efforts and increased consumption.
Reyaz Mihular, Managing Partner KPMG in Sri Lanka stated that ?The CRI is an important contribution to the development debate, reflecting KPMG?s commitment to new approaches and insights. It informs efforts to build greater change readiness and seize new opportunities that benefit society. As a 118 year old firm we are a strong believer that change is inevitable and of utmost importance in order to be successful.?

Pan Asia Bank offers 5.5% interest rate for savings accounts
	
		 		 
		 
			
Pan Asia Bank offers the highest interest rate of 5.5 percent for its savings accounts through its flagship savings product ?Champion Saver?.?
This interest rate is amongst the highest for a savings account offered by licensed commercial banks in Sri Lanka.?
Unlike in certain instances, a Champion Saver account holder will continue to enjoy the higher interest rate irrespective of the number of withdrawals made. Withdrawals could be made from any ATM which carries the ?Visa? logo.?
He/she is only required to maintain an average monthly balance of Rs.50,000 in order to be eligible for this higher interest rate. However the account could be opened with an initial deposit of Rs.1,000.?
In the case of the balance reaches below Rs.50,000, the account holder will continue to receive the bank?s normal savings interest rate until he/she elevate the balance up to Rs.50,000. ?
The account holder can either opt for a pass book or a monthly statement when opening the account but if he chooses the former, he will receive a specially designed pass book.?
Apart from the higher interest rate, a Champion Saver account holder will also enjoy a host of other benefits such as visa debit card, SMS banking facility, internet banking facility and standing order facility.?
A Sri Lankan resident over 18 years of age or foreign personnel with resident visa status can either walk into any of the Pan Asia Bank?s 78 branch network spread across the country or through our online banking portal to open a Champion Saver account to obtain all the above benefits and many more introduced by the bank time to time. ?? ?
Pan Asia Bank is BBB rated by Fitch Ratings Lanka Limited with a stable outlook and BBB+ by Lanka Rating Agency is testimony to the financial strength of the bank.?
For the financial year ended December 31, 2014, the bank recorded a 265 percent growth in its net profits to post Rs.415.2 million. ?
Further, Pan Asia Bank was adjudged as the fastest growing commercial bank in Sri Lanka in 2014 by United Kingdom?s Global Banking and Finance Review.?
At a time when the market interest rates are at all-time low, Pan Asia Bank?s Champion Saver provides an ideal investment opportunity with all the flexibility of a savings account.

The nomination list of the SLFP had not been finalised even though nomination papers were signed, Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said today.
??They might be changed,? he said speaking at the weekly Cabinet briefing.
The nomination list must be signed by President Maithripala Sirisena as the leader of the SLFP to finalise it.
Senaratne said a report had been submitted to President urging that nomination should not be given to those who were charged with various allegations.
When asked if former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would be entitled to privileges granted to a former President if he was elected to Parliament as an MP, he said that Rajapaksa could not enjoy two privileges at the same time- that of an ex-president and of an MP.
Minister Senaratne said in lighter vein that Mr. Rajapaksa would get only two security personnel, if he was elected as an Opposition MP.
At present Rajapaksa is given a contingent of more than 200 security personnel as a former President.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH
