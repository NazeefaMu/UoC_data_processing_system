Mariott hotel not mine: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today denied reports that the Ceylon Steel Corporation and the Mariott hotel in Dubai were his property, which were ?paper owned? by a frontman.
Mr. Rajapaksa in a statement said the FCID had filed a B-Report informing the Kaduwela Magistrate?s Court that they have commenced investigations into a complaint that a sum of USD 48 million was invested in the Steel Corporation and another USD 190 million was invested in the Dubai Mariott hotel which purportedly belongs to Rajapaksa.
?The FCID which functions as an extension of the UNP may have filed this B-report to convey to the public the false impression that there is a ?court case? relating to concealed assets owned by me. It will be useful for my opponents to spread such a perception among the public with a general election in the offing. This is yet another clever and insidious way of carrying out false propaganda against me,? he said
According to Mr. Rajapaksa, the B-report had stated that the FCID had commenced this investigation on the basis of an anonymous letter and that it was very unusual for the police to report to courts that they are carrying out an investigation on the basis of such a letter.
?The FCID has been set up with a view to harassing political opponents and the legality and propriety of the establishment of this unit is already before the Supreme Court.I wish to inform the public that the Steel Corporation and the Dubai Mariott hotel belong to whoever owns them and not by me,? said, Mr. Rajapaksa.

Video: Gotabaya?s FR Petition will face problem - Ranil
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today that the Fundamental Rights Petition filed by former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa would face a problem as the Cabinet which is named as the respondent may not be in existence on the next hearing date.
Mr. Wickremesinghe, who was speaking at the International Media Summit at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI), said that the question would arise as a new Cabinet would be in place on the next hearing date in October -- as there would be a new parliament by September.
The prime minister said he wanted to file his answers as soon as possible. He said the petitioner Mr. Rajapaksa had a right to have redress as soon as possible, without waiting till October.
He suggested that the government should seek the advice of the Commonwealth Judges Association. He justified this by pointing out that Sri Lanka held the Commonwealth Chair currently and was bound to follow its practices.
He said he agreed with some of the observations which Opposition Leader Nimal Siripala De Silva had made at the summit.
Mr. De Silva, who spoke before the Prime Minister said the private sector media should practice self censorship so that they won?t defame anyone. Citing an example he said a report that a former head of state had deposited billions of dollars in a foreign bank had caused harm to that person. (Yohan Perera and Darshana Sanjeewa)WATCH

UN refugee agency wants India, SL ferry service to resume
	
The UN refugee agency today appealed for the resumption of ferry services between India and Sri Lanka saying it would help in the return of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees from India, the Economic Times said.
"We look forward to the resumption of the ferry service between India and Sri Lanka that would be of enormous support to those who wish to return," said Golam Abbas, representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Colombo.
Yesterday, over 40 refugees left for Sri Lanka voluntarily from Chennai and Tiruchirappali under the aegis of the UNHCR.
The total number of refugees whose return from India has been facilitated by the UNHCR this year so far has now risen to 147.
They returnees said they had escaped Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict and had lived in camps in Tamil Nadu since as far back as 1990.
The India-Lanka ferry service between Tuticorin and Colombo was resumed in June 2011 after a lapse of nearly 30 years. However it was scrapped a year later as it did not prove to be a commercially viable operation.
During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Colombo in March, the two countries had expressed strong willingness to resume the service as early as possible.
Over 100,000 Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka live in Tamil Nadu. Out of those, about 65,000 live in 107 camps spread across the state.

Govt. should celebrate War Victory: Nalaka Thera
	
	The National Movement for the Protection of Liberated Land (NMPLL) said today the government was duty bound to celebrate the war victory.
	Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera alleged that the government had allowed LTTE separatists to commemoratethe memory of LTTE terrorists.
	?LTTE activities have not stopped completely even today. While the LTTE is banned internationally, the government has allowed the TNA to commemorate the memory of dead LTTE terrorists. The TNA considers LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran as its hero,? he said.
	The monk claimed that the government was not working towards the betterment of the country but was catering to the needs of western countries, India and the Tamil diaspora and it was paving the way for the division of the country.
	?What western countries and India want is to foster terrorism.? the Thera said.
	Ven. Nalaka Thera said the government had planned to celebrate the dead instead of commemorating war victory.
	He said NMPLL together with some other opposition political parties had decided to commemorate the memory of war heroes on May 18 at Independence Square.

I refused a bribe of Rs. 300 m - Rajitha
	
	Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne alleged yesterday that a respondent involved in the controversial Avant ? Garde case had offered him a bribe of Rs. 40 million to remain silent on the issue for just two weeks and that another person had offered him a bribe of Rs. 300 million.
	Speaking at the weekly Cabinet media briefing at the Information Department, Dr. Senaratne said bribe was offered by a venture that earned Rs. 450 million a month.
	?This is the type of inducement offered to us by various unscrupulous elements to catch us. But we have never succumbed to them. Several of my friends told me I was the only person who did not fall for these carrots. If I had accepted, I could have lived in super luxury in the rest of my life. But I value my self respect and dignity more than these inducements,? he said.
	A journalist: How are you going to prove that there was actually an offer of a huge bribe made to you?
	Dr. Senaratne: ?I have a recording of the telephone conversation concerning the bribe.
	A journalist:? Then why did you not lodge a complaint with the Bribery Commission, as offering a bribe is a criminal offence?
	Dr. Senaratne: I couldn?t do that; because if I did, a good friend of mine would have been in trouble -- as it was he who had introduced this man to me. But he has assured to me that if something went wrong or if they tried to put me in trouble he would come forward on my behalf and produce the evidence.
	Journalist: Where are those ethanol and drug kingpins that the team of the Common Opposition candidate boasted of bringing to book soon after their election
	??????????????? victory?
	Dr. Senaratne: It is a concern for me too. You know, the method by which inquiries are made about them is slow and lethargic. Though the government has changed, the system remains intact. That is the problem. I must not tell you how Colombo Stock Exchange, casino and ethanol money worked during the presidential poll.
	Journalist: The Supreme Court has stayed the anticipated arrest of former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa by any law enforcement officer. What do you have to say about this ruling?
	Dr. Senaratne: An excellent example of good governance and of the independence of the judiciary. The judges do not get telephone calls and midnight visits by armed personnel when a case against the government or government politicians is being heard.
	You must be careful how you enjoy the benefits of good governance. I agree that it takes time to adapt to the formalities under good governance. But you must be very cautious and vigilant when you live under good governance after going through oppressive tyranny.
	I must recall that when parliament was opened to the public in 1956, a person who visited parliament sat on the chair of the Speaker.
	The then prime minister who was beaten under the wave of Pancha Maha Balavegaya aptly said ?The bitch went to the moon and the country went to the dogs? to describe the transformation. ?
	Journalist: Are you unhappy about the developments?
	Dr. Senaratne: No I feel sorry. It seems the people and the officials do not appreciate their new found freedom and the value to their life. It was I who fought against the oppressive and dictatorial acts and policies of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa. If he accepted my advice he would have been president even today. He listened and accepted only the hosannas sung to him by swindlers and court jesters who knew that they would be paid better if they sang songs of praise to the ?King? and the king fell prey to them and perished.
	Did any of the ministers who now go after Rajapaksa give any signal or warning or direct him on the right path? No. What they said was that it was because of Mahinda that the sun and moon rose and went down. It was because of Mahinda that the birds sang and flowers bloomed. Without him there would be no country, no nation and no future. Poor Mahinda fell for this and lost everything. I feel sorry for him because he has done much for this country despite his weaknesses and foolishness. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said torday that financial assistance would be sought from Japan or the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the construction of the northern expressway.
He said the contracts would be awarded afresh once the financial assistance was secured.
Mr. Wickremesinghe told a meeting at UNP headquarters Sirikotha that the government could not put the people into difficulty by awarding the contracts to those who had given commissions to authorities of the previous regime in exchange of the contracts.
He said this was because the costs for most of this development work had been over estimated.
He said the plan of the previous regime was to increase taxes to generate funds to meet these expenses.
?We cannot help these contractors to reach heaven by lighting their way but our intention is to light the way for the people towards prosperity,? he said.
However he said the intention of the government was to seek the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for this project.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said the Northern Highway projects also fell into this category.
However, the Prime Minister said the government had managed to come to a settlement with the contractors with regard to some development work which will begin shortly. (Yohan Perera)

Chaaya Blu accomplishes five glorious years
	
The retro-chic Chaaya Blu Trincomalee belonging to the Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts chain, celebrated 5 eventful years on 10th May. Over the past 5 years, the hotel has evolved into the prime leisure destination on the east coast, not only for its uber stylish offering, but also due to its status as the best whale watching hub in the country.
Built around the theme of sun, sand and water-based fun activities, Chaaya Blu Trincomalee offers an exciting whale watching experience for guests that is built on sustainable and responsible tourism practices. Significantly, the hotel has earned its reputation by demonstrating a robust sustainability framework that ensures that all its stakeholders are part of the hotel?s success story.
While whale watching offers a novel experience for guests, it is a vital lifeline for the local community. The hotel has employed local fishermen (who ply their boats for whale watching) and fitted their boats with non-polluting, silent engines so as not to disturb the marine life. The hotel has invested heavily in acquiring such equipment and infrastructure to develop a professionally-managed whale watching operation for its guests. Commencing with 2 boat operators, the hotel has built up a pool of 8 fishermen, who regularly operate the whale watching expeditions under the supervision of Chaaya Blu Trincomalee.
The hotel has empowered these boat operators with knowledge about the dos and don?ts to preserve marine life and ensure safety of guests. Every whale watching trip is accompanied by a naturalist who shares his knowledge with the guests.
Since the hotel commenced operations 5 years ago, it has increased the percentage of local residents in its employment, providing a secure and stable livelihood source for people from surrounding communities. These employees are further supported by free English speaking and soft skills necessary for future success in their careers.
Another far-reaching sustainability initiative undertaken by Chaaya Blu Trincomalee is the preservation and clean up of Pigeon Island, famed for its live corals and rich marine life. Over-visitation and weak environmental regulations is putting the corals and marine life on the island at risk, thereby threatening their existence.
Chaaya Blu Trincomalee has taken on the challenge of educating their guests who visit Pigeon Island about the ecological impact of coral reefs and the importance of not walking on or breaking off corals as souvenirs. The hotel?s efforts at nurturing the natural wonders of Pigeon Island have been commended by the Sri Lanka Navy.

	Asgiriya Mahanayake the Most Ven. Galagama Aththadassi Thera today expressed displeasure over the manner in which the Diyawadana Nilame of Sri Dalada Maligawa, Pradeep Nilanga Dela Bandara was questioned by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID).
	The prelate expressed these views when President Maithripala Sirisena called on him today.
	The Thera further said the questioning of the Diyawadana Nilame could have been done in a more appropriate manner without disrespecting Buddhism as a religion.
	?Both Malwathu and Asgiriya Chapters were shocked upon hearing of the summoning of the Diyawadana Nilame to the FCID. He should have been questioned privately and unnoticeably if he had done something wrong,? the Thera said.
	The Diyawadana Nilame was questioned by the FCID on Tuesday over an alleged financial fraud at the Dalada Maligawa.
	The Mahanayake Thera also said he looked forward to a change in the electoral system and, therefore, was studying the proposals in this respect.
	Expressing his views when President Maithripala Sirisena called on him today, the Mahanayake Thera said he was studying the 20th Amendment to the Constitution that led to the introduction of a new electoral system and was happy with the new rather than the prevailing system. The prelate said that the prevailing system caused disputes even between family members. (Nadeeka Daya Bandara and J.A.L. Jayasinghe)
