Australia, SL working closely to end people smuggling: HC
	
Australian and Sri Lankan?authorities are working closely together to shut down people smuggling syndicates operating in the?region, Australian High Commissioner (HC) Bryce Hutchesson said?today.
In a statement, he said the two countries are working together to track down those responsible for organising latest incidents of people smuggling.?
High Commissioner Hutchesson thanked the Sri Lankan Government for its strong ongoing cooperation.
?Together we are stopping people dying at sea and helping to prevent vulnerable people being exploited,? he said.
He emphasised that people smuggling was a serious transnational crime that could only be stopped by close collaboration between countries.
The High Commission warned?Sri Lankans to beware of the lies of people smugglers, following media coverage of three recent failed people smuggling attempts.
In December 2017, Australian border protection authorities intercepted a people smuggling boat?with 29 Sri Lankan nationals on board. All 29 people were returned to Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan authorities also recently disrupted two planned illegal boat ventures before they departed Sri Lanka.
The vessel intercepted in December was headed for Australia, but several passengers indicated they had left Sri Lanka thinking they were travelling to New Zealand.
High Commissioner Hutchesson said the interception of this boat showed that some people in Sri Lanka still wrongly believed it was possible to travel illegally to Australia or New Zealand by boat, or that there was some benefit to be gained by attempting this dangerous voyage.
?In the past four years, every Sri Lankan people smuggling boat that has entered Australian waters has been stopped, and everyone on board these boats has been returned to Sri Lanka.?Australia?s border is very well protected. Anyone who says otherwise is lying. People may have reached the Australian region illegally in the past, but Australia?s defences against people smuggling are now stronger than ever,? High Commissioner Hutchesson said.
Since the implementation of Australia?s toughest ever border protection measures in 2013, Australia has intercepted and turned back or returned 800 people from 32 people smuggling vessels; including more than 165 Sri Lankan nationals.

Blood tie overcomes party rivalry
	
?
One may react with surprise to a report from the upcountry about a strange case of two rival parties operating their election campaigns from the same residential premises. One campaign is led by a paternal uncle and the other by his nephew.
?
What is more amazing is that they belong to two parties embroiled in a cobra-mongoose-type feud. The paternal uncle is leading the Blue party campaign in the district while his nephew is deeply involved in the Pohottuwa campaign there.?
Activists of both parties are reportedly conducting their respective party activity in a spirit of give and take.
Blood is thicker than water, they say.

Bond report was not sent to Ravi: Speaker
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday dismissed a claim made by UNP MP Ravi Karunayake that he had obtained a copy of the report and confirmed that the Bond Commission report was only forwarded to the president's office, Parliament, the Attorney General and the Central Bank.
He said this when responding to questions asked by several MPs and statements made by the Campaign for Free and Fair Election Executive Director Keerthi Tennnekoon that the report was incomplete.The Speaker said the report had no missing pages and in itself a complete document.
"I checked this with the presidential secretary, who assured me that the report was complete and and has not been sent to any outsiders other than the CB, the AG and Parliament," the Speaker said.
Opposition MP Chandrasiri Gajadeera asked the Speaker what action he would take if the presidential secretariat had not sent a complete report.
"I can only convey the assurance given to me by the president's secretary and not comment on what others say," the Speaker replied.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake suggested that the president's secretary should be summoned to Parliament if the report is incomplete report and not the one submitted to the President by the PCoI. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Complaint on gold chain leads to an illicit love affair
	
While attempting to lodge a complaint on lost Gold Chains, police uncovers details of an illicit love affair.
This story is revealed from the Dambulla Police sources.
The police had been informed on its emergency line of the robbery of two Gold Chains by a woman saying that three persons snatched the Gold Chains she was wearing and escaped.
The HQI of the Dambulla Police Sampath Wickramarathne who lost no time on this matter had instantly deployed three expert police officers to nab the thieves.
They had first met the woman who complained about the robbery and they visited the place where the incident had taken place and also noted the time of the incident. Police had doubts about the woman when she said the robbery took place at about 11.30 in the night, but she had informed police only the following day around 5.00 am. In her statement she had stated that she could identify the three suspects.
The police acting on this information had arrested three persons on suspicion from a house while they were sleeping. Police had also found the gold chain of the woman. When the suspects were interrogated at the police station they accepted that they snatched the two gold chains from the woman.
They also stated to the police that three of them had attended an election meeting and had consumed liquor and when they were returning home around 11.30 pm, they had noticed near a shrub and taking cover behind a three wheeler, saw this woman was engaged in sexual act with someone.
After finding out who they were they had assaulted the man and the woman. The woman afterwards had begged the three individuals not to tell this incident and embraced them. In the rush one gold chain the woman was wearing broke and fell. They had got hold of the chain while the other was pulled out by the woman herself and swallowed it.
The police who questioned the woman had accepted the facts as stated by the tree suspects. They were taken into custody. The police admonished the woman.
Police sources revealed that the woman had left her home after her husband and the children had been sleeping, saying that she is visiting her sick mother. While she was in the company of her paramour the three youths had confronted the duo. (K K Ariyadasa)

Electing a professional as Colombo  mayor  ideal - SLPP candidate  Dr. Pradeep Kariyawasam
	
Dengue cases dropped drastically due to former Defence Secretary?s city development??
It is not advisable to build high-rise buildings on narrow roads
Housing is a pressing issue in Colombo
I decided to follow former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in politics because he saved the country from terrorism
65 percent of people in six percent of Colombo?land area??
It is far below ?WHO? requirement for space??
Former Chief Medical Offic
er of Colombo Municipal Council?Dr. Pradeep Kariyawasam is contesting the local government elections as mayoral candidate to the Colombo Municipal Council under the ?Flower Bud? symbol of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna [SLPP]. He says it is better to have a professional as a mayor of Colombo.??
Q As the Chief Medical Officer of the Colombo Municipal Council for 26 years, what made you to contest the local government elections as the mayoral candidate under the Flower Bud symbol??
My whole family has been supporters of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) traditionally. My father?s youngest brother was the party?s organizer for Akmeemana in the 1980s. Now, there is a breakaway faction. Actually, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa saved our country from the scourge of terrorism and prevented it from disintegration. I thought I should follow his footsteps politically. He is someone who did a lot for the country despite various allegations.??
Q Colombo Municipality has been a UNP stronghold. In fact, even when Mahinda Rajapaksa was at the height of his popularity, the UNP won in Colombo. How challenging would it be for you this time?
It is a challenge. I have always taken up challenges. For example, in my Public Service Department, I should have had at least 1200 workers. I had only half of them. Yet, I did better than any of the former Chief Medical Officers. I managed to get Colombo declared as a Polio free zone.?
How I did it was that I got all the staff members except labourers trained in Polio vaccination. That was to put drops in the mouths of children. In one way, we vaccinated all the children in the city who were under five years of age. Actually, this should have been done by nurses and midwives. I thought I should get the maximum out of my staff. I followed the same steps in terms of controlling Dengue, Cholera etc. I utilized the facilities and available manpower.??

Q What are the pressing concerns you have identified in Colombo??
The main thing is housing. Actually, 65% of people in the city live in underserved settlements. These underserved settlements are in 6% of the land area in Colombo. You can imagine the gravity of the problem. Their houses are too small. That is a matter of concern. In a house of 400-500 sq ft, two to three families are living. However, the WHO norm is 120-150 sq ft per person.? ?
Housing is a pressing concern, while land is another issue. I suggest constructing three-story buildings and give the people adequate space at the same abode where they live now. People could use the ground floor for business purposes. Women can do such activities for income generation.??
There is a need to have a better transport system to get rid of traffic congestion. We find a lot of high-rise buildings on narrow strips of lands. We must ensure that no more high-rise buildings are put up in this manner. In fact, residents cannot park their vehicles. These small roads are used to ease traffic congestion on major roads.?
This is one of the major complaints raised during my door-to-door canvassing process. We have to look for improved traffic designs. These narrow roads should not be used for uni-flow traffic. During rush hours, residents cannot even get out. People who live peacefully on these lands abutting narrow roads cannot do so any more. When high-rise buildings are put up on narrow roads, there is no ventilation coming to houses.?

Q What is your plan for eradication?of Dengue?
Actually, I implemented a very successful programme. After I retired, they stalled it. New types of Dengue fever are found in Sri Lanka. It happens with the arrival of some foreign nationals infected with the disease. We have to contain the spread of the disease in Colombo first. It is like the head of a body. We have to protect the head first. They stopped the anti-Dengue campaign which we initiated. After that, it spread to other areas. We had a programme that received an international award. I would like to resume it if elected to office. For that, we have to fill in the vacancies. There are about 120 vacancies for health instructors and around 50 vacancies for field assistants to control mosquito breeding. We have some other vacancies for health educators and midwives as well. All these people could be used for Dengue-control work.? ?
If we contain the disease in Colombo, it could be contained easily in other parts of the country.?
?Q Your rival candidate Rosy Senanayake of the UNP said former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa made only cosmetic changes in the city in his city development drive. What is your response??
He developed the city starting from the Port up to Gregory Road. It spread to Bauddaloka Mawatha, Bambalapitya Junction and Galle Face. That was the triangle he developed. That was how he started. After developing, we did not find a single Dengue patient in that area. The area surrounding Gregory?s lane was full of Dengue patients. Once it was developed with properly laid drainage lines, we did not find any patient in the area. What is happening now is that no one is maintaining these areas. The other thing is that it serves as a catalyst for people in the area to clean their own residential gardens. They noticed how the government did it. Then, residents also followed suit. The government?s initiative, at that time, bore fruit to people?in that manner.?
?Q What is your message to the city voters this time?
I saw the 2018 budget. It is only Rs.18 billion. Out of that, Rs.10 billion is meant for the municipal engineers. Out of that also, Rs. 3.5 billion is spent for garbage disposal. Last time, they allocated only Rs.1.5 billion for it. This time, it has been increased by 50%. Garbage collection is outsourced to the private sector. The private sector should collect garbage daily if they receive an increased allocation. It should be looked into.??
Q How important is it for professionals to join politics?
I have been in the CMC for 26 years. It always had commissioners who were professionals. During the last ten years, we had administrators from the SLAS. Before that, it was either engineers or doctors who served as the?Municipal Commissioners.?
If we had a mayor who was also a professional like in Singapore, we know exactly what the problems and technical solutions to them are. Rather than apportioning blame on each other, we have to find solutions in that manner. We must have a clear idea about the cost. It is a good idea that professionals are joining politics. They have the practical knowledge.?
?Q There is ethnic and religious diversity in Colombo. What do you suggest to foster unity among all?
these groups?
We should always think that we are all Sri Lankans. We should forget the religious and caste differences. We have to elect knowledgeable and qualified people to run the Council. Otherwise, we would end up being countries like Libya, Syria or Lebanon.?
They stopped the anti-Dengue campaign which we initiated. After that, it spread to other areas. We had a programme that received an international award. I would like to resume it if elected to office. If we contain the disease in Colombo, it could be contained easily in other parts of the country
?Q During the previous government, there was a proposal to make a Colombo Municipal Corporation. How do you see the practicality of it?
I think Colombo should be expanded now. Rather than building all the institutions within the city limit, they should be taken out of the city. There are high-rise buildings coming up. Who will take the burden of all the sewer lines? It is better to have pockets of areas surrounded by parks and greenery.
?That is always better to expand the city to Nugegoda, Battaramulla and Angoda areas. Also, we must have proper transport systems and roads. It is a good idea that we expand and introduce a corporation system.?
?Q What do you think of the new election laws governing the local government polls?
It is a good thing that we got rid of the preferential voting system. Candidates are very less. In my case, I have to print a certain number of leaflets and make door-to-door visits. We do not put up posters and we held small pocket meetings.?

Who will take the burden of all the sewer lines? It is better to have pockets of areas surrounded by parks and greenery
?
It is good in that way. The number of members to be elected has increased. It is not a good idea. There are too many members, and therefore the cost would be high. A job which is normally done by one person, has to be done by three or four people as the result.

ETF Will  contributors  receive a fair return ?
	
While activities concerning the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) came under much scrutiny in recent times, its sister fund the Employees? Trust Fund (ETF) has seldom been discussed. Even when discussed, many have pointed to a looming merger of the two social security programmes, followed by fears of the funds being open to abuse and misappropriation. Substantial portions of the ETF investments are invested in gilt-edged government securities; and yet many have opined that its beneficiaries are not receiving the highest available returns. Established under Act No-46 of 1980, the Employees? Trust Fund Board (ETFB) initially commenced operations under the Labour Ministry. As of June 2017 the ETFB functions under the Ministry of Development Assignments and covers all private sector employees and all public sector employees who are not entitled to the Government pension scheme. With an estimated 79,000 employers contributing 3 per cent of the gross earnings of their employees to the fund on a monthly basis, the ETFB today boasts of a 270 billion fund.??
Benefits Galore
Mahinda Madihahewa - Chairman / Chief Executive Officer, Employees? Trust Fund Board
The ETFB has three main functions; the collection of funds, investment and member services. Elaborating on these services ETFB Chairman Mahinda Madihahewa speaking to the? said that the board spends approximately 500 million per year, under three types of benefit schemes, without levying any charge from its employers. Out of the 10 benefit schemes of the ETFB, six fall under the criteria of health. The heart surgery scheme, kidney transplant scheme, intra-ocular lens implant scheme, disability scheme and death benefit scheme are some of the welfare schemes provided for its active members by the ETFB.? ?
?
?As this is a voluntary scheme, those who are self-employed can pay Rs. 500 per month and they will be entitled to all the benefit schemes offered by ETFB. This is also valid for foreign employment and benefits can be obtained if a migrant worker pays a fee of $10 or Rs. 1,000. This is the special feature of the ETF, whereas this facility is not provided by the EPF. At the moment we have about 40,000 self employed people contributing to the fund,? Madihahewa said, speaking on the special scheme provided for self employed persons.? ?
Out of the 10 benefit schemes of the ETFB, six fall under the criteria of health
ETFB has 18 regional offices across the island
?We are also in the process of signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE). We?ve had several rounds of discussions with SLBFE to this end. Our goal is to cover all Sri Lankan foreign employees, including returning migrant workers through our fund, so that they too can benefit from this social security scheme,? he added.? ?
Asked of the awareness initiatives undertaken by the ETFB, Madihahewa said the board has launched mobile service through which employees can seek services. ?Last year we implemented the ?Janapathi Jangama Sewa? to expand the reach of our services. ETFB has 18 regional offices across the island and one of our key focus areas is the plantation sector, as many workers there do not have an identification number.? He said the ETFB together with the Central Bank, Labour Department and the Department for Registration of Persons, have launched a joint project where such workers receive an identification number.
?We are in the process of introducing something called the ?Unit Number?. The Unit Number is the identification number given for members of both the EPF and ETF. Following the appointment of a committee by the Prime Minister, to introduce an EPF and ETF tracking system, we have signed a MoU with the Department for Registration of Persons, the Department of Labour as well as the Central Bank. The unit number will therefore facilitate this initiative. Until now, employers had to provide the members with the identification number. We are in the process of converting this system into an employee centric system, where the unit number will replace the identification number,? Madihahewa explained.? ?
Madihahewa took office three years ago and has since overseen many projects, including the restructuring project of the board. The ETF Inspection System Application (EISA) is one such project undertaken by Madihahewa. ETF?s Enforcement Officers have been provided with tabs that possess details of members and employees, in an effort to digitise the field work of the board. The project is carried out with technical assistance of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) together with the Finance Ministry. ?All our officers have been trained by the ILO technical officers. A training programme is currently underway for our employees to aid our digitisation efforts. There is also an ICTA project involving Rs. 120 million in funds. Our software is more than 15 years old. Under the restructuring process we are now re-engineering the entire computer system,? Madihahewa said.? ?
The ETFB Chairman is also seeking to improve its human resource management programme under which he aims to make several changes to the board. ?Earlier contributors had to wait for long periods of time -- ranging from 3 to 6 months-- to get their monies. But now we have an express service, where an employee, upon requests made during the morning, can obtain his or her money by 2.00 pm. Other services have been expedited to serve members within three to seven days. Our services were decentralised recently. In addition to the ETFB office in Nuwara Eliya, we established one in Vavuniya last year, along with an office in Jaffna, while we are also extending our services to Trincomalee as well.? he said.? ?
Productivity improvement is another goal of the ETFB as officials attempt to reduce the waiting time of members who seek their services. These efforts have been carried out with the help of the National Productivity Secretariat. ?ETFB employees owe their services to the working population of this country, which is 8.5 billion. There are 1.4 billion workers in the public sector with the remainder working in the private sector and semi-government sectors. We have only covered 2.6 billion of this workforce, with our limited resources. The ETFB is looking to increase our enforcement cadre, who will be responsible for providing our services to employees without having to come to Colombo,? Madihahewa said of the board?s ambitious future plans.
Adequate Assistance
Anton Marcus, Joint Secretary, Free Trade Zones & General Services Employees? Union
The? ?also spoke to the Joint Secretary of the Free Trade Zones and General Services Employees Union Anton Marcus to obtain his views on employee awareness on the ETF process and benefits. Speaking on awareness of the ETF among workers, Marcus said in terms of contributions there is no great difference between the EPF and the ETF. ?Every employer which contributes to the EPF also contributes to ETF. For us however, the EPF is something we can redeem as a long term reward, when we are looking at retirement. In contrast we are able to claim short term benefits from the ETF. Our members are of the belief that they are able to claim these benefits when required,? he said.?
?
Asked of inconveniences faced when attempting to claim benefits, Marcus noted that there are many members who faced difficulties in filling out forms, which require assistance from the employers. ?There are some details which should be filled out by the employers. Since an employee is only able to claim these benefits only once in five years, we have come across instances where employees were not assisted by their employers. In the event where a company has shut down, there are members who have been rendered helpless, as there is no employer to fill this part of the form,? Marcus said.? ?

?
?Sometimes if a company has not suspended its operations, but are pivoting operations or changing its name, employees are given a new letter of appointment. In such instances the ETF has notified us that this action is recorded as a termination of employment. The board has also arrived at a decision that employees can?t claim benefits if there is such a termination of employment. When one of our members faced such a situation last year, we had to go through great difficulty and claimed benefits through the intervention of the Chairman. As far as I know, almost 50 employees of two factories faced this problem. There may be more people who had to face similar circumstances,? he added.? ?
? ?not easy to misappropriate funds
Wasantha Samarasinghe, JVP Politburo member
While the ETFB boasts of exemplary services to the working population of the country, experts point to several issues in the grand scheme of things. The? ?spoke to JVP Politburo member Wasantha Samarasinghe who in his brief comments noted that while it is not an easy task to misappropriate funds of the ETF due to legal constraints, it is vital that the investments made on behalf of the public be made considering optimum benefits to the contributing members.? ?
Errors and Misconceptions
Sunil G Wijesinha, Former Chairman of ETFB
Echoing his sentiments is a former Chairman of ETFB Sunil G Wijesinha, who subsequently served on the Board of Directors on three other occasions. He believes there is much confusion about the respective objectives of the two funds and rationale for setting up the ETF. Speaking to the? ?Wijesinha said having participated in panel discussions as both a panellist and a participant where EPF and ETF have been discussed; he is appalled by misconceptions on the two funds, highlighting the need to have informed discussion on the matter.? ?
The ETFB ignoring the fundamental philosophy behind each scheme
During the establishment of the ETF in 1980, the purpose of the Act was to ensure a gratuity to all employees
?
?Some officials have admitted that new schemes have been introduced by the ETFB ignoring the fundamental philosophy behind each scheme,? he said. Explaining further Wijesinha said the EPF was created as a superannuation scheme, an organizational pension program created for the benefit of employees. ?The ETF on the other hand is widely accepted as the idea of late Lalith Athulathdmudali who wanted to create a fund which could be partly used to finance industrial and commercial ventures and thereby benefit the working population by creating more employment. At that time worker participation in management was a popular concept and therefore the concept included economic democracy and worker participation in management through equity investment as objectives,? Wijesinha noted.? ?
Purpose defeated
As per the broad outline of the ETF scheme announced during the establishment of the ETF in 1980, the purpose of the Act was to ensure a gratuity to all employees and to enable the investment of monies in the fund for purposes beneficial to the employees. This was in contrast to the case of EPF from which there is state borrowing. However Wijesinha notes that these fundamentals have been ignored by authorities in the recent past.? ?
?Why would the Government create two funds for the same purpose if the purpose was to endorse state borrowing?? he questioned. ?This is the reason why, when attempts were made to amalgamate the EPF and ETF funds, I pointed out the error in deliberating this course of action without understanding the fundamental purposes of the two funds. I have notified the Premier in this regard in writing, to which I have not received a response. We need elaborate public understanding and discussion on this matter, so that the positive objectives of setting up these funds would not be lost,? Wijesinha stressed.? ? Responding to a query on the security of the funds, Wijesinha noted that there exists an unfounded fear among many uninformed members that their savings are not actually available. The reason for this fear has been attributed to assumptions that the Government has appropriated them. ?Even educated private sector managers have expressed this fear. More communication is required to educate employees that their funds are safe. With over 95 per cent investments in Government securities there should be no doubt that the funds are safe,? he said, stressing however that this was not the desired objective of the establishment of the fund.? ?
Speaking on the objects of the ETFB and the clause on promotion of employee participation in management through the acquisition of equity interest in enterprises, Wijesinha said it is his belief that this dangerous object should be removed.? ?
?There were clear instances when the ETF acquired significant stakes in companies which were being privatised, thus completely defeating the objective of privatisation. In one instance the ETF acquired 90% of the equity of a company being privatised. By and large the objects for which the ETF was formed has been achieved, but it was only in the early 1990s that a clear identification of what ETF stands for, and the difference between EPF and ETF, was made. This enabled many who argued that the ETF was a mere duplication of EPF to realise the difference,? Wijesinha opined.? ?
The former ETFB Chairman underscored that it is imperative the authorities re-visit this and re-define the objectives in line with current requirements, without deviating from the objects specified in the ETF Act. ?The Board should not be callous in its equity investment policy. Every investment however small must be transparent and justified. The investment in shares is grossly insufficient and defeats the purpose for which this fund was set up,? Wijesinha underscored. He added a separate study is required to determine whether the EPF and ETF have provided a fair return at least equivalent to the savings interest rate of the National Savings Bank.? ?
?I hope the policy makers would not lose sight of the useful objects of ETF and would formulate two funds to be managed by one body and continue the programmes that would benefit employees during their working life and continue to promote those techniques which would provide a safer workplace and create healthier workers,? he reiterated.??

GL says PM bribed TNA MPs to vote for budget
	
The Bribery Commission should probe the allegations made by MP Sivashakthi Anandan that 15 Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MPs had been bribed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's Ministry of National Policy and Economic Affairs, the Joint Opposition said today.
SLPP chairman G.L. Peiris told a news conference that with regard to the MP?s claims they were bribed to vote in favour of the Budget and that each TNA MP was paid Rs.20 million.
?The BC should probe these allegations, or else the President should take action against this incident. If not, the JO itself would file a case in this regard,? he said.
Mr. Peiris said this incident was as an insult to Parliament.
Meanwhile, he said according to the Constitution, the President did not have the authority to manage the country?s economy.
?All the ministries related to the economy are under the control of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and the UNP ministers. To make this statement a reality, he should take control of ministries such as Ministry of Economic Development and Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs. Otherwise, it will be a mere statement,? Mr. Peiris said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Govt. unable to identify real challenges: Gota
	
Former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said the current government has failed to identify the real challenges facing the country and instead had made the defaming of Mahinda Rajapaksa as its only challenge and objective.
Addressing a meeting in Gampaha town organised by the Siyane Vidvath Sansadaya Scholars? organization through Skype from US, he said the previous government had a visionary leadership to identify the real challenges which were highlighted in the Mahinda Chinthana Programme. He pointed out that the Mahinda Rajapaksa government had an able team to achieve its goals and that they took steady decisions.
?The basic problem facing the government is its failure to take right decisions for want of a visionary leadership. The government has been led astray by western ideologies and the lopsided policies of International organizations including the World Bank and the IMF. We must follow the footsteps of developed countries including Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea, Vietnam, Japan and China never depended on the Western block. Japan, despite its close relations with the west, upheld its culture and protected its sovereignty.?
Mr. Rajapaksa said the public service had been crippled as a result of the actions of the Government.
?The public service is an integral part of administration. The country?s public service had declined for several years. We identified the able officials and empowered them to take independent decisions. We obtained their services for the benefit of the country. The public service should be uplifted under short term and long term projects as a part of the country?s development effort. A mechanism should be worked out to retain the services of Sri Lankan expatriates. Effective training programmes and formal recruitment procedures should be implemented,? he said adding that the halting of infrastructure projects in villages has resulted in an irreparable economic loss to the island.
?Well improved infrastructure facilities should be provided to develop the country. Several projects inaugurated by Mahinda Rajapaksa government have grounded to a halt. There is a Chinese adage, ?A road should be constructed if a village is to be developed?. We have experienced how difficult areas could be developed by providing infrastructure facilities. Development is often centralized in the western province and that disparity resulted in insurrections. With this in view we developed infrastructure facilities in Hambantota and Monaragala districts. The Hambantota harbour and the airport brought about a rapid development in the district. The present government has abandoned these development projects for the last three years on false pretexts causing irreparable loss to the country?s economy.?
Mr. Rajapaksa however, admitted that the previous government possessed flaws, and the need of the hour was to change the political culture in the country.
?The previous government didn't do a perfect job. It should be admitted that there were flaws. We have identified them and we should rectify them. During the north-east war the people were subject to hardship. However, it was a great achievement that we could end it within three years. The need of the hour is a new political culture and all those concerned including politicians, administrators, public servants, business community and the Rana Viru personnel should put their heads together and achieve that object," he said.

JVP mayoral candidate for Colombo Municipal Council Dr. Ranil Jayasena ?Improving quality of people?
	
My patients? living conditions forced me to enter politics
when I went around Colombo,I witnessed?a hell
This is the most disciplined, non-corrupt party, which a person like me could join
We can?t believe what they have been doing with the money they collect as taxes
We as the JVP are targeting to establish full power in 2020
To be productive and efficient, a person needs to be healthy and educated
With the Local Government Elections looming around the corner, the need to elect the right candidate to power is quintessential. With Colombo being a major business capital that attracts investments and promotes tourism, the Mayor of Colombo is entrusted with the major responsibility of maintaining a corrupt-free environment favorable for its citizens while ensuring the positive development of the City. In a candid interview with?Dailymirror the , Colombo Mayoral Candidate contesting under the JVP ticket?Dr. Ranil Jayasena a Gastrointestinal Surgeon by profession explained why he decided to enter politics and also talked about his plans to forge ahead in fighting corruption within Colombo, if elected. Dr. Jayasena started his career as a Gastrointestinal Surgeon at the North Colombo Teaching Hospital in 2001 and was appointed as the first ever G.I Surgeon at the National Hospital in 2009. Following are excerpts of the interview done with Dr. Jayasena.?
Q?Could you tell us about yourself and why you decided to enter politics??
I?m a Consultant Gastrointestinal Surgeon who retired from service three months ago. Now I?m engaged in private practice. Actually I didn?t decide to enter politics, but was forced by my patients to come forward. I treat patients and prescribe treatment. Now I find it difficult to give instructions to patients because many can?t follow these instructions due to political problems they face. These issues are all politically motivated and patients have to face them. I will give some examples. One of the main causes for Gastritis is mental stress and I have come across so many people coming with mental stress due to political problems. Actually I have kept this issue in my mind. It has been of concern to me for a long time. When it came to a critical point I was forced by patients to come forward as the candidate. So my decision to enter politics wasn?t sudden.? ?
When I treat patients I ask them to have at least three meals a day and drink at least two and half litres of water to prevent themselves from developing gastritis. There were patients from some parts of the country where six people were compelled to share one litre of water among themselves due to the lack of sufficient water. This is a pathetic situation that we came across. There were patients who came to me with mental stress and severe gastritis despite being non alcoholics, nonsmokers in addition to not being frequent drug users. Nevertheless, they were experiencing severe mental stress irrespective of race and social class and this stress was linked to politics.?
?
There were judges who suffered from severe gastritis because of the pressure they had to face from higher authorities in politics; who forced them to leave the country eventually. There were Catholic and Buddhist priests who had so many problems due to political pressure. I felt very sorry for our people and what these politicians have been doing to ruin this country. When the elections were declared I was invited to contest as the Colombo Mayoral Candidate. However before accepting the invitation, I discussed this with my family members and toured around Colombo to see whether I could do something. Through my patients, I came to know about the situation in Colombo to some extent. But when I went around Colombo, I witnessed a hell amidst the beautiful buildings. It was a pathetic situation and I saw blocked drains, collected garbage and flies and mosquitoes infesting the place. I saw small houses accommodating nearly six to seven people, where its members were sleeping according to a roster. Some houses were void of electricity. These people need to be provided with adequate accommodation and health facilities. However, nothing has been done to this effect.?
?Q Why did you choose to contest as the Colombo Mayoral Candidate under the JVP ticket??
This can be answered very easily. There were only two major parties that were ruling this country for seventy years; UNP and SLFP. With the SLFP broken into two factions, now we have a corrupt triangle formed by UNP, SLFP and SLPP. This corrupt triangle is full of corruption, scam and fraud. If you watch the T.V, listen to the radio or read a newspaper, you may notice that these are the words that are frequented by them.? ?
The only major party exclusive of this corrupt triangle is the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). This is the most disciplined, non-corrupt party, which a person like me could join. Fortunately there is at least one party for a person like me to join.? ?
Q It is believed that there was a lot of corruption, fraud and waste going on in Local Government Councils. If appointed as the Mayor of Colombo, what measures would you take to fight corruption?
Hopefully, I will have a good theme to work on and if members of the JVP are selected in large numbers to councils (who are all non corrupt), I can give a real assurance to the country that the fight against corruption will continue. Most of the unresolved problems in the Colombo Municipal area have risen due to waste and corruption. There is no doubt about that because annually they collect 15.8 billion as taxes. We can?t believe what they have been doing with the money they collect as taxes. Among the various things people say regarding this, some say that this money is spent on certain officers to travel? abroad. There are also stories that some people are involved in the casino industry and in gambling. These officials spend excessive amount of money to entertain their relatives by giving them contracts and offering tenders to friends and relatives. However, these are facts that people say that are yet to be verified.?
?
If I am appointed, I will put a full stop to all this corruption and will have a very transparent and non-corrupt policy where there will be no opportunity to waste money. We will take the responsibility of developing the Colombo city and where necessary, we can give contracts on tender basis.? ?
Q Do you believe that the country needs a new political culture?
Definitely. That is why we are trying to change the prevailing culture. We ask people to extent their support to us in order to establish a firm foundation in local councils. We as the JVP are targeting to establish full power in 2020 and this is only the foundation. As a person (reference is made here to the writer) engaged in media, don?t tell me that it is not possible. This is certainly possible. What we want is for people to understand and change their attitudes. People have been in a pseudo -sleep. This means that we are not really asleep, but we are pretending to be asleep. When a person pretends to be sleeping, it is difficult to wake him up, nevertheless they can hear us. Contrarily, it is easier to reach the person who is really asleep although he can?t hear us. I think that people are in a pseudo-sleep where they can hear what we are saying and now they are slowly reaching us. Now we are giving them the real message to see whether they can understand the real situation in this country.? ?
As a doctor I have been spending my time with people since the day I began my career; feeling their pulse, listening to their heart beats and reading their minds. Therefore, I understand the real situation of the? country. I think I can address our people and get close to them.? ?
Q As a medical professional, what do you think are the drawbacks in the Sri Lankan health care and education sectors?
At the national level there are plenty of issues that we need to address. We are always talking about such matters within the frame of party politics. If you talk, you can?t do anything. We have allocated only 1.3 percent for education from the Gross National Product and 1.9 percent for health. Discussing everything within this framework is not possible and this is not the policy of the JVP. We are going to talk within a different background with an allocation of at least five percent for education and six percent for health. Within this frame, we can do many? things.? ?
If we assume power we give priority to these things because this constitutes the heart and brain of this country. If so, it?s not difficult to develop this country. To be productive and efficient, a person needs to be healthy and educated. The education system has been put in a mess by these Governments and there is no significant development in students. As a doctor I have seen many cases where children are diagnosed with obesity, hypertension and diabetes. This is also partly due to this irregular education system where children tend to skip meals due to the number of tuition classes they are burdened with. These children get fat due to the lack of sufficient time to engage in an exercise or sport leading into various health problems at a later stage. Non communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension will deteriorate their health.? ?\
What we want is for people to understand and change their attitudes. People have been in a pseudo -sleep. This means that we are not really asleep, but we are pretending to be asleep. When a person pretends to be sleeping, it is difficult to wake him up
On the other hand, we can?t manage the number of beds in the hospitals. The National Hospital has 3,500 beds, but the daily occupancy of beds is about 1,500 beds. This means that everyday there are about 1,500 vacant beds in the hospital, but there are so many wards with a shortage of beds where patients are forced to either share the beds or sleep under the bed or in the corridor. They can?t even properly manage the beds in the hospital. The rulers should be held responsible for these problems.
? ?Q Colombo is a city that attracts a lot of investment and is also a tourist destination. Taking these facts into account, the need to maintain city beautification is also very important. What would you do to achieve this goal if elected?
Beautifying the city is very important. However, if I become the Mayor of Colombo, I will definitely give priority to the alleviation of the poor peoples? lifestyle, which is in a very pathetic situation. What is the point in beautifying only the city when the lifestyle of these poor people have not improved for the better? Beautifying the country is not a difficult thing to do, but improving the quality of life of these people is more challenging and important comparatively. These measures should be carried out in a parallel manner. As for beautifying the city, first we should focus on the proper disposal of garbage. We should address the practical problem related to garbage disposal in order to maintain city beautification.? ?
Q What do you think are the burning issues within Colombo that need to be solved immediately??
The burning issues that need to be solved soon include proper garbage disposal, prevention of floods and the dengue epidemic. Also proper living conditions should be given to people and blocked drains should be reconstructed. Measures should be taken to avoid the risk in areas vulnerable to earth slips. Improving the condition of poorly constructed byroads is also very important.??
Q What are your views regarding the new electoral system?
There are both pros and cons regarding the new electoral system. The pros are that there is a person elected to the ward who will be held responsible for the work carried out in the area. So the people have the advantage of identifying and getting the work done through the elected individual. Also, there is an improvement in terms of female representation and I think that they also should be given an opportunity to be represented. However I think the number of council members are high which is a disadvantage because the Government will have to spend more money on them. However, the number of members elected through JVP will not be a burden to the country because our people are not corrupt.? ?
Q How confident are you of being elected to office under the new electoral system?
I cannot predict the future and my real motive is to convince people of the prevailing problems in the country. I want our people to have confidence in us and extend their support to us and we will help them in return. Beyond this point, I have never thought of anything else.?
?Q JVP?s theme at the Local Government Elections is ?Power to build villages and defeat corruption?. How do you view this slogan and how does JVP plan to achieve this goal?
Our goal is to have a very transparent and non corrupt administration. This also includes our vision to have a clean and green city in addition to providing an excellent service to the masses.??

PCoI report was first sent to Parliament: Amaraweera
	
UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera today assured that no politician had been given the bond commission report before it was submitted in Parliament.
"Even we as government members did not receive it beforehand," he said.
The minister said the President and the government were ready to publish all the reports and added that they would not allow anyone to suppress or hide anything connected to the report.
He said revealing certain annexes would be disadvantageous when filing cases against those held responsible by the commission and added that however, no information would be hidden from the people.
The minister said the President and the SLFP were of the opinion that everyone responsible in the bond scam should be brought to book. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Ravi thanks MS for absolving him, PM and UNP from bond scam allegations
	
UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake in a statement today thanked President Maithripala Sirisena for appointing the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on the bond issue after the formation of the good governance government and through its final report for absolving the UNP, the Prime Minister and especially him from all allegations levelled.
He released the statement to the media after he was denied the opportunity to do so in Parliament. The MP referred to the President?s statement on the bond report where he said, ?The report mentions the responsibility of former minister Ravi Karunanayake regarding the rent payments for a penthouse apartment by Walt and Row Company owned and controlled by the Aloysius family. The report states that a legal case should be filed against him under the Bribery Act as well as under the Penal Code for giving false statements to the Commission."
Mr. Karunanayake contradicted this part of the President statement and said the report, made available to him, only said relevant authorities should look into them if there was any wrongdoing and if such wrongdoing were discovered then appropriate action should be taken in this regard.
?This is indeed a bizarre situation. It is as if during a game of cricket the batsman lets a wide delivery be, only to be declared as dismissed by the Umpire,? he said and added that the media campaign launched against me by connecting me to the controversial bond issue is in fact a planned conspiracy.
Full statement;
Honorable Speaker,
First and foremost I, Colombo District Member of Parliament, Ravi Karunanayake would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity to present my statement regarding the breach of my parliamentary privileges before the house. ?
On January 8, 2015 2015 a dream resonated within our hearts. That is, the establishment of consensus and good governance while also establishing democracy, reconciliation that was once lost while bringing about economic and social development in the country. To achieve these targets on January 8, 2015 we were able to elect a new President and a government following which in the same year we established a consensus government.
However unfortunately in a matter of three years this dream appears to be slipping away from us due to misleading and narrow political objectives.
But today I am making this speech as a person who not only strongly believes in but also stands for consensus and good governance while hoping to fight till the very end to make this dream a reality.
My expectation is not to attack anyone
There is perhaps no other political figure whose character was more assassinated and insulted than me due to the controversial bond issue. Therefore I have a right to prove my innocence in this regard. But I have no intention of attacking anyone through this statement. Instead I take this opportunity to prove my truthfulness regarding the allegations leveled against me.
Despite the criticisms levelled against me, I have the strength to face them. It's the strength of the truth. The strength of fairness and justice.
Perhaps this is the first time in the history of parliament a complaint is being made such as this regarding a breach of privileges.
As a person who always stood for and fought for good governance, I have become a ghastly and planned political target of these chain of events.
At this time I recall a proverb in local folklore. "<U+0DC0><U+0DD0><U+0DA7><U+0DAD><U+0DCA> <U+0DB1><U+0DD2><U+0DBA><U+0DBB><U+0DAD><U+0DCA> <U+0D9C><U+0DDC><U+0DBA><U+0DB8><U+0DCA> <U+0D9A><U+0DCF><U+0DB1><U+0DB8><U+0DCA> <U+0D9A><U+0DCF><U+0DA7> <U+0DB4><U+0DC0><U+0DC3><U+0DB1><U+0DCA> <U+0D92> <U+0D85><U+0DB8><U+0DCF><U+0DBB><U+0DD4><U+0DC0> ? "
Was awaiting the report
Honorable Speaker, ?
From the time my name was dragged in to the activities of this commission, I have been impatiently awaiting the release of the report.
The Presidential commission to investigate in to the questionable issuance of treasury bonds? was appointment by the his excellency the President on January 27, 2017. Following this appointment the investigations were conducted for around 10 months after which the compiled report was presented to the President on December 30, 2017.
The commission report which consisting of thousands of pages was then hurriedly summarised in a mere three days during the new year by a committee comprising of senior officers who in return handed this over to the President.
Based on this report summary on January 3, 2018 the President made a special statement through media outlets. My statement today is mainly focused and based on this statement made by him.
President?s Statement
The statement made says the following :
"The report mentions the responsibility of Former Minister Ravi Karunanayake regarding the rent payments for a penthouse apartment by the Walt and Row company owned and controlled by the Aloysius family. The report states that a legal case should be filed against him under the Bribery Act as well as under the Penal Code for giving false statements to the Commission."
This says a case should be filed against me.
However in the report thereafter handed over to us only says that relevant authorities should look into if there is any wrongdoing and if such wrongdoing is discovered then appropriate action should be taken in this regard.
This is indeed a bizarre situation. It is as if during a game of cricket the batsman lets a wide delivery be, only to be declared as dismissed by the Umpire. ?
Please allow me to explain. ?
Going through this report it is clear that the media campaign launched against me by connecting me to the controversial bond issue is in fact a planned conspiracy.
Certain politicians and media outlets carried out major propaganda campaigns claiming that as the Former Minister of Finance, I advised state banks regarding treasury bond transactions thereby making the government incur serious losses in revenue.
The commision says a different story
However the commission says a completely different story.
I would like to bring your attention to Page 838 of the report. It says the following :
We have earlier, concluded that, in view of the undesirably high Yield Rates which then prevailed, it was reasonable and justifiable for Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, MP, the then Minister of Finance, to wish to bring these Yield Rates down at these Treasury Bond Auctions. We have also taken the view that, since successive Governments have been known to use the state-owned People?s Bank, National Savings Bank and Bank of Ceylon to implement some policy measures and it is not per se irregular for a Government to do so, we cannot find fault with Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, MP, the then Minister of Finance for convening these meetings and giving the aforesaid instructions to the three State Banks.
Through this the commission accepts that as Finance Minister it was just and legal of me to reduce these rates.
?It was reasonable and justifiable for Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, MP, the then Minister of Finance, to wish to bring these Yield Rates down at these Treasury Bond Auctions?
The commission further accepts that the previous governments have also taken similar action according to their policies while confirming that I am not in the wrong in this regard.
?To implement some policy measures and it is not per se irregular for a Government to do so, we cannot find fault with Hon. Ravi Karunanayake?
Meanwhile an extensive propaganda was carried out claiming that I instructed the Central Bank. However the commission has now rejected all these statements.
I would like to once against bring page 838 of the report to your attention. It says :
?However, we have also earlier concluded that, there is no evidence before us which suggests that, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, MP or the Ministry of Finance advised the CBSL that the aforesaid instruction had been given to the three State Banks?
According to the report the commission has accepted that there is no evidence to say my Ministry nor I had instructed the Central Bank in these transactions. ?
Honorable Speaker,
The commission in its report more importantly accepts that the Central Bank or the Treasury bond issue was not under my control or influence at the time.
Lawyers Conclusions
My learned lawyers have informed me of the following conclusions they have arrived at after going through the commission report.
The commission has confirmed that I have no connection to Perpetual treasuries or another party receiving a profit from the purchase and sale of treasury bonds.
The commission does not report of evidence regarding any wrongdoing and/or illegal on my part with regards to the sale of bonds by the Central Bank and/or the purchase of these bonds by a primary dealer.
Commission Recommendations
Honourable Speaker,
I will now focus on the recommendations in the commission report.
Chapter 33 of the report focuses on the recommendations. Pages 921 - 922 holds 30?????? recommendations. I have been mentioned in recommendations number 24 and 25 on page 920 and 921.
Please look at recommendations number 24 on pages 920 - 921 in the report before you.
?As stated earlier in Chapter 24, we recommend that, the Commission to Investigate?? Allegations of Bribery or Corruption should consider whether Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, MP, while he was Minister of Finance, derived a substantial benefit from the Lease Payments made by Walt and Row Associates (Pvt) Ltd [which is an Associate Company of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd and which is owned and controlled by the same persons who own and control Perpetual Treasuries Ltd] for the lease of apartment occupied by Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, MP and his family and, if so, determine whether appropriate action should be taken against Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, MP, under the Bribery Act;
We recommend that you decide on the steps to be taken
Here it says ?Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption should consider Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, MP, while he was Minister of Finance, derived a substantial benefit and if so, determine whether appropriate action should be taken?. It does not say to file a case against me.
Therefore this conspiracy is now clear to all of you. Where does it say that a case should be filed against me for bribery and fraud? These are planned political conspiracies. In fact they are reprehensible conspiracies. In fact it is an attempt to politically assisinate my character.
The next matter is even more dangerous
The next matter is in fact more serious and dangerous. I will now read out the recommendation number 25 on page 922. Please draw your attention to that page.
?As stated earlier in Chapter 24, we also recommend that, the Hon. Attorney General and other appropriate authorities consider whether some of the evidence given by Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, MP before us is shown to have been incorrect and, if that is the case, whether Mr. Karunanayake should be prosecuted under Section 179 and/or Section 188 of the Penal Code or other relevant provision of the Law, read with Section 9 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act No. 17 of 1948?
Does not say to file for legal action
Here the commission has merely says ?the Attorney General and other appropriate authorities consider whether some of the evidence given by Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, MP before us is shown to have been incorrect and, if that is the case, whether Mr. Karunanayake should be prosecuted?.
It does not ask for a case to be filed. This is a conspiracy that goes even beyond.
In the statement written for he President it says legal action should be taken against me for giving false evidence to the commission. However the report does not say I have given flase evidence. It recommends that the Attorney General and other authorities should consider if the evidence given by me? appears to be false and if so then it should be decided if legal action should be taken against me.
In the end the only relevant issue related to me is the Rs. 11 Million borrowed by my daughter in order to make a rental payment for her company which was later repaid.
I will now resolve this issue before the house as well.
I now bring page 827 of Chapter 24 in the report to your attention.
Page 827 says Mr. Karunanayake did not produce any evidence to show that any reimbursements had? taken place by my family to Walt and Row Associates (Pvt) Ltd. That is repayment of the money cannot be proved.
Receipts showed were not looked at
However according to page 832 in my answer I have said ?I got the receipt here that the reimbursement has taken place? as shown by the report.
While the presented the receipt on the day however no effort was taken to investigate further on it.
While I am unable to say who this was not checked however it is unfair to level allegations against me after failing to look in to the receipt even after it was presented to the commission.
I am not able to say what sort of Presidential Commission this is. But if this is how they operate I must say that I have been prejudiced against even after providing receipts for a? a reimbursed payment done by my daughter.
Conspiracy to arrest me
Honorable speaker
A major mudslinging campaign is being carried out stating that I have false evidence before the commission while various news on websites say certain officers in the President?s office are adivincing that attempts should be made to arrest me. ?
If as claimed I provided false evidence then under Section 10 of the COMMISSION OF? INQUIRIES ACT? the commissioners could have acted against me immediately. If I infact lied then officers of the Attorney General?s department who questioned me had no reason to keep quiet regarding it.? The commission could have punished and taken action against me.
I can recall that certain MP?s gave false evidence before the commission and later apologized for it. However how can it be understood as to why allegations against me are being allowed now after not taking any action in the past five months. Therefore I once again stress that this is nothing but a cheap political conspiracy. But for whose want is it being carried out is the question?
Where is Anika?s testimony?
I am sure you remember that the Attorney General?s department complained to the commission that a relation of mine made death threats to a lady who had levelled allegations against me. This is a complete falsehood.? The individual is not a relation of mine. But the media gave prominence to this news. Believing these lies the public gave in to the misconceptions about me and my family. This made a serious negative impact on my political life.
But no mention of this major incident which was important to the Attorney General?s department as proved by the media circus following it has been included in the report. This is yet another side of this political conspiracy.
The statement made by the owner of the property which all the allegations against me was based on was given widespread media publicity. This greatly affected my good name and reputation.
Creating a major media hype this lady was given VIP protection of the government as a result. Similarly protection was also given to her brother. But no such protection has been given to me, a person who made great sacrifices for good governance and is now suffering as a result.
But what surprises me is that the statement taken from this lady after providing all this protection has not been included in the commission report.
I have a question to raise in this instance. Was all the media circus created and security provided to obtain a useless evidential testimony? Or was public money utilized to fund security for this person to obtain evidence to merely sling mud at me?
This is a complete contradiction. A distortion. A conspiracy. In fact it has misled the public and society. We must destroy this sleazy political culture.
In a country where good governance is in place how did such false and distorted information find its way to the President?s statement through the intervention of the first citizen?s office? We must look in to this?
Did it occur due to an error in translation? Or through negligence? No matter how it occured it is clear that this has caused great disgrace and dishonour to the President. Despite reluctance to admit it this is the bitter truth.
Purposeful distortion of facts
Accordingly my opinion is that those who studied the report on behalf of the President and those who prepared the special statement by the President has purposely and cleverly distorted these facts purposely.
I do not stress on this fact according to a whim or guesswork. I bring up this fact with good reason.
I would also like to mention that these mentioned facts are not related to the issued mandate for which the Presidential Commission was appointed. However I was called in by the commission for the related investigations and as beneficiaries of the Yahapalana and Consensus government We fully supported this endeavour.
I even resigned from the post so that investigations of the commission will not be affected and also in order to establish a new political culture in the country. However even after that media campaigns were launched by this conspiracy to sling mud against me and to mislead the public.
What are the falsehoods uttered by me?
However now I would like to know what these falsehoods that were allegedly uttered by me. It is my right to know this.
Honorable Speaker,
On the face of it there are serious contradictions between the commission report and the statement made by the President based on this. I have been made a politically targeted in some instances and it clearly appears to be schemic in character as well. Such commissions, through these actions, lose its credibility and dignity while also losing face before the general public.
How were past bond issues disregarded?
In fact first the bond issues between 2008 - 2015 should have been investigated. If so the current political situation would have become vastly different. But a political decision was made to first investigate the bond issue between 2015 - 2016.
We have done no wrong so we bravely faced the commission. But your focus should be brought to one particular fact. That is the fact that committees were also previously appointed to look in to this incident.
Firstly the Prime Minister appointed the Pitipana commission
Thereafter the COPE committee under D.E.W Gunasekara investigated the details regarding this.
Again this was examined by the Supreme Court.
Later it was also examined by the Bribery and Fraud Commission.
Thereafter, an inquiry was also held by COPE COMMITTEE led by Sunil Handunneththi regarding the bond issue.
I was dragged in to this
Honourable speaker, <U+0D9C><U+0DBB><U+0DD4> <U+0D9A><U+0DAE><U+0DCF><U+0DB1><U+0DCF><U+0DBA><U+0D9A><U+0DAD><U+0DD4><U+0DB8><U+0DB1><U+0DD2>,
The above mentioned committees and organizations in many ways investigated in to this incident. However none of them made no mention of me. This is because the subject matter of the investigation was not under the control of my Ministry. This is a clear fact.
But the Presidential Commission dragged my name in to the bond issue deal.
Not only did they do that they even dragged the members of my family in to this issue. The officers of the Attorney General?s department even asked private questions which are not usually not asked in such an inquiry. These actions of the officers of the Attorney General?s department in turn became a media circus against me.
However what are the final recommendations made by the commission relating to me? If I am correct is only says to take necessary action after evaluating the information given by me. But in the statement written for the President it says legal action by way of a case should be taken against me.
Honourable Speaker,
I would like to ask if me, my family and the United National Party were presented as sinners and stoned to this end?
Was I painted as a sinner, made to bear a cross and taken to the Calvary mountain by a media circus to finally be told this?
Kekille Judgement
But Honorable Speaker,
But what is happening now? Not only I, who had no connection to this incident was tied to it through this special statement I have once against been connected to this issue despite the confirmation that there was no wrong doing on my part.
In short I can only say that I have been delivered King Kekille?s type of a verdict as a result.
Honorable Speaker,
However one thing is clear. It shows that those who planned this conspiracy were not able to enter their wants and purposes to this report. In fact the plans and hopes of those attempting to attack the consensus good governance government are now in crisis due
While this is the case however the mudslinging continues due to these cheap political tactics.
The target of the conspiracy is not Ravi!
Once again I say, this conspiracy is not one aimed at Ravi Karunanayake.
There is more to this, this is why they took a huge risk by distorting the President?s statement to publicize their agenda. If not how did they have the courage to risk the reputation of the President.
This shows someones dire need to politically assassinate my character. It continues to happen today.
Meanwhile the parties have also mislead the public by spreading fallacies regarding the issue. These are all done for political gain and sling mud at me as proved before the commission.
The good governance government was formed against the mass scale corruption and frauds in the recent past. However no formal action has been taken following investigations in to these. Therefore in this situation I thoroughly condemn the selected attacks on those connected to the UNP being.
What is this anger against the UNP? This is where the conspiracy is. This is their intention. And they continue to struggle to achieve this.
I ask of you today, What can be said about Ravi Karunanayake today? The commission recommendations are crystal clear.
However how many investigations as promised prior to January 8, 2015 are yet to commence and continue to be unclear.
The loss due to Sri Lanka due to the Hejin deal Rs.? Million 96000
Srilankan Airlines loss amounting to Rs. Million 146000
Mihin Lanka loss amounting to Rs. Million 12300
Greek Bond loss Rs. Million 3900
Cost to construct Mattala Airport Rs. Million 46000
Cost to construct the Nelum Kuluna Rs. Million 7600
Cost to construct the Defence Headquarters Rs. Million 64000
Cost to construct the Hambantota Port Rs. Million 130000
The MIG deal Rs. Million 85000
Pyramid transaction loss? Rs. Million 11800
Commission reports gathering dust
Also it must be noted that there are 34 interim reports of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate Serious Fraud Fraud. If not for political reasons then why are no steps being taken in this regard?
Honorable Speaker,
In the past Presidential election and the General election we made a promise to the people. We assured that we will investigate and punished those involved in corruption during the past government. We promised that we will not be corrupt if we come to power. We said we would bring in new and more stringent laws to stop corruption and fraud.
Our government has largely commenced in to looking in to corruption and frauds of the previous government while also appointing presidential commission to look in to alleged frauds taken place during the rule of our current government. If our government in fact wanted to steal then we would not have handed over the COPE committee presidency to the opposition. We are currently working towards formulating laws to stop any future corruption and frauds.
Honourable Speaker,
The politicians of this country has the bad habit of going after the President or the party leader when they are accused of any wrongdoing in a bid to save themselves.? This happened during the Rajapaksa era as well.
Today how many politicians continue to hide behind his excellency the President and without having cases being filed despite charges of corruption levelled against them. How many in the SLFP have been left without any legal action being taken against them? How many in the Joint How many cases have disappeared due to the so called lack of evidence?
Therefore I have one message to those who are not doing what they promised but are attempting to better themselves by latching on to us. Ravi Karunananayke does not hide and attempt to save him self. I do not work according to that theory.? We do not challenge the country?s courts and social justice through such cheap political moves. We will not do for in the future also as only those who have committed a wrong should hide.
Just look at most those who appear to take the moral high ground but are in fact compulsive liars and the speeches made by them prior to January 8, 2015 while on Rajapaksa?s campaign stage.? Look at the statements being made by these same individuals today. These seemingly genuine characters are full of words but do not act accordingly.
How Chinchimanawikawa? came with a tied bundle of wood
Honorable Speaker,
It is however not unsurprising that these should happen to a ordinary mortal such as myself. This is happened to the Lord Buddha as well. In the past a woman of ill repute such as the Chinchimanawikawas was sent with a tied bundle of wood before the Lord Buddha. But however God Sakra let the bundle loose to prove the Buddha?s innocence. ?
The story of the Bond Commission is therefore one of beauty. They are saying to check if this bundle of wood let loose, right before one's eyes is in fact a baby. And says if the bundle of wood is a baby then to hand it over to the father. Given the opportunity there are today's Chinchimanawika?s who are trying to continue their game in attempting to topple this government.
Sinners who threw stones at Sirikotha
Is this a joke? Many individuals and parties tried to destroy the UNP at various junctures. Attempts to destroy the party with guns, bombs and conspiracies were not successful. It will not be successful today or even tomorrow. We will not allow for this. Our supporters know we will not allow the sinners who divided the party while hurling stones at Sirikotha to destroy this party. If attempts are being made by these pawns to destroy this strong party the UNP knows how to respond to this. It appears that certain pawns have forgotten how the party strongly responded to those who attempted the same during the Rajapaksa era.
Honorable Speaker,
As politicians we should be prepared to face any condemnations and allegations thrown at us. We should be strong enough for this. But however malicious statements bringing pain to children, wives and family members who are not connected to politics are not acceptable by the civil society. ?
These mudslinging campaigns greatly shocked and upset my daughters.? Who will pay for all the pain and tears of these children? However I must thank my wife and children for giving me the strength to stand tall even while suffering due to these insults.
I must also extend my gratitude to the leader of our party for his endless support, and to our supporters and colleagues in the parliament. I would also like to thank my well wishers who loves and wishes to protect this good governance government while also thanking them for the hundreds of calls to encourage me. ?
I would also like to thank those on social media and websites who eventually understood the truth regarding this.
Thank you : Let us see on the 10th!
Therefore Honorable Speaker,
With great respect I urge to you bring your kind attention to the fact raised by me and to protect by privileges accordingly. ?
The UNP has also been greatly affected due to this conspiracy being carried out during the election season by targeting me and the United National Party in general.
On February 10 I am sure that our supporters and well wishers along with the activists who worked to bring about a political change on January 8, 2015 will give these conspirators? the correct response. The victory of the United National Party is assured.
Finally I would like to end this statement by thanking his excellency the President who appointed the Presidential commission to look in to the bond issue after the forming of the good governance government and for through its final report for absolving and releasing the UNP, the Prime Minister and especially myself from all allegations levelled against us.

This taboo on the sheaf of betel may appear preposterous at a glance. But the party has imposed it with good reason; when one is offered a sheaf of betel as a token of welcome, the recipient would raise joined hands holding the sheaf to acknowledge the greeting. And the betel leaf is the symbol of the Blue party-led alliance, the main rival of Pohottuwa
Of course, Pohottuwa has suggested an alternative; to offer a Lotus flower bouquet to the party leader as a token of their welcome!

SL to remain engaged with disarmament goals
	
Sri Lanka hoped to remain proactively engaged within the Conference on Disarmament (CD) to help achieve its objectives, Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha said on Tuesday on the occasion of Sri Lanka assuming the responsibility of the CD as its first President of the 2018 session.
Sri Lanka assumed the Presidency of the CD after 11 years.
In his speech, Ambassador Aryasinha said the CD held a significant responsibility with regard to a rule-based international order that Members of the UN family were seeking to uphold.
?The CD?s continued inaction sets a negative precedent by not measuring up to effectively preventing or responding to new and emerging security challenges through the adoption of appropriate international instruments. Therefore, it is time to avoid the temptation of subjecting the work of this Conference to the vagaries of the ever-changing international strategic landscape, and instead we must endeavour to harness its potential to build common ground to achieve collective security,? he said.
Sri Lanka called on member States of the CD to seek to bring back the necessary attention at the highest political levels to the CD in order to maintain the integrity and credibility of the Conference, as well as to create forward movement and momentum.
Addressing the plenary, Ambassador Aryasinha noted that Sri Lanka assumed the Presidency of the Conference "At a time this august body has critical challenges and some opportunities before it".
He said the challenges include the prevailing complex global security environment, the increasing threat posed by non-State actors - with global anxieties about nuclear weapons at their highest since the end of the Cold War, the advancement in military technology, as well as parallel discussions and deliberations that are taking place outside the Conference.
Ambassador Aryasinha said to enhance international security, the pace of multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation must be accelerated, "taking into account the security interests of all States and on the basis of the principle of undiminished security for all".
Sri Lanka delegation to the CD included Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva Samantha Jayasuriya, Minister Counsellor Sashika Somaratne and First Secretary Mafusa Lafir.
