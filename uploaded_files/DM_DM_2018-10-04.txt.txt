Prez to decide on IGP next week
	
President Maithripala Sirisena would take a decision on Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara in the next few days unless he tendered resignation, Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
Minister Senaratne admitted that it was difficult for IGP Jayasundara to remain after President Sirisena expressed his displeasure over his behaviour in public and as the Police Chief.
Responding to the Daily Mirror at the weekly Cabinet news briefing yesterday, Minister Senaratne said the IGP was appointed by the Constitutional Council and therefore, President did not have the power to fire him.
He said but members of Parliament could bring and pass an impeachment motion against him in Parliament and then the CC could fire him.
Minister Senaratne said President Sirisena berated IGP Jayasundara at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday (02) and not capable of giving leadership to the Police.
Interestingly, not a single Minister, including Minister of Law and Order Ranjith Maddumabandara under whom the Police Department runs, did not say anything against what President said on Police Chief.
Mr Jayasundara has been questioned on last Friday (28) by a three-member Special Committee appointed to investigate allegations levelled against him that in 2008 he accepted a bribe of Rs. 12 million from a former Principal of Trinity College, Kandy, he said.
Minister Maddumabandara appointed this three-member Commission comprising three top public officials headed by Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Mala Basnayake.
Under normal circumstances, the Government will have to wait until the committee releases its report.
Besides, IGP Jayasundara has no other charges against him but his behaviour and certain public utterances are the problems.
The crime rate has also come down in the country during his tenure, Minister Senaratne stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Public misled about train fare hike: GMR
	
The General Manager Railways (GMR) yesterday said the public had been misled by the announcement made at a recent Cabinet meeting which had only referred to the increase of 15 per cent in train fares without explaining how it was calculated.
Speaking to the media GMR Dilantha Fernando said no details had been provided to the public except the increment at the Cabinet briefing which had caused much confusion among train commuters.
Accordingly, it was explained that the train-fare revision of 15 per cent was not on the current fare but based on the train fare charged per kilometre.
Circulars for new ticket prices had already been sent to the main stations around the country and requested them to display three copies of ticket prices in substations situated between two main stations. The Station Masters (SMs) of main stations were told to calculate the train fares manually, he said.
The GMR requests the public to make complaints to the counters if there were any issues in the ticket prices shown. The new fares should be displayed at each station for the benefit of commuters, it said.
Tickets needed for three months are in stock at every main station. It said new stocks of tickets would not be delivered to stations that had failed to sell all its train tickets. Several stocks of tickets with the revised prices had been sent for printing, he said.
Since 1926 the calculation of train fares was done according to a certain formula.
The previous fare charged per kilometre was Rs. 4.20 for the first class, Rs. 2.30 for second class and Rs.1.30 for a third class ticket. The 15 per cent increase has been calculated based on this fare for the three classes. Thereafter, if the fare when calculated, for example, comes to a sum which is between Rs.10.50 and Rs.14.50 it will be rounded up to Rs.15, Mr. Fernando explained.
He said the fares have been rounded up to avoid the issuance of small change. When asked if this calculation method fair to commuters, he said the same procedure was adopted when ticket prices were last reviewed in 2008. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Rapid increase in importing small cars during past nine months: CMTA
	
There was a rapid increase in importing of vehicles less than 1,000 CC engine capacity to Sri Lanka in the first half of this year, The Ceylon Motor Traders Association (CMTA) today said.
While issuing a statement they said, 90% of the small vehicles had been imported during the past nine months and 86% of them were brought through the Grey market.
Many of these vehicles were imported by individuals or private dealers who have the capacity to stock large volumes. Those unregulated imports demanded the sources to take stern action for vehicle imports by the Government, the CMTA said.
The association admitted the Governments action in response to the sudden depreciation of the LKR and thereby needed to adopt policies to control imports.
The Government had decided to control the vehicles import by adopting a mandatory 200 % cash margin on establishing the Letter of Credit (LCs) for importing vehicles, temporary suspension of permits and the adjustment of Loan to Value (LTV) ratio for vehicle financing.
Therefore, the CMTA suggested the Government should implement a scheme to register vehicle importers to the control importing vehicles. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

## Title: Reconciliation, peace and silence

Reconciliation, peace and silence
	
When the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) declared in Parliament on May 19, 2009 that the civil war in the country was over, there was silence among the Northern people. An independent observer of the war could easily distinguish between peace and silence at that time. Peace is present when one knows that there is cooperation for coexistence. In a peaceful environment one party to a conflict can put aside the weapon and sleep at night knowing that the enemy would never pull the trigger in his gun. True peace exists when two parties come to an understanding to cease all hostilities. The scenario is quite different when one party crushes the other and claims to have ushered in peace. 
The LTTE was wiped out after an almost three-decade war. The Tamil community in the island wouldnt want another war. But whether enough has been done by the Government through a much publicised rehabilitation process remainsa question. 
The Government claimed recently that out of 12191 ex-LTTE cadres who were rehabilitated only one remains to be released. Some work has been done during this rehabilitation process. The late LTTE cadre Thamilni Jeyakkumaran in her book titled Thiyunu Asipathaka Sevana Yata recalls how ex-tiger rebels were taught life skills at Government maintained rehab centres. The Government recently claimed that ex-rebel cadres had been provided with self-employment opportunities, fishing gear and educational requisites. The Government claims to have spent Rs 26 million in initiating this programme. 
Rehabilitation is two-pronged. One aspect of rehab is to add value to the lives that have been disrupted. Teaching them life skills and providing them with opportunities to try out these skills solves only part of the problem. But what about the mental wounds which the Tamil people still suffer from
True peace exists when two parties come to an understanding to cease all hostilities. The scenario is quite different when one party crushes the other and claims to have ushered in peace
Thileepan
To cure these mental wounds of the Tamil community one must understand the psyche of this community. Commemorational ceremonies for the dead are part and parcel of the Tamil community. This culture was present even during the times when the LTTE was in control of most parts of the north. In this context we are made to think that a wise decision was taken by the Government authorities because the recent commemorational ceremony of the late LTTE cadre Thileepan-AKA as Rassiah Pradeepan-was not disrupted. His friends and relations were allowed to participate in the ceremony during which a photograph was placed next to a monument built in Thileepans name. 
The GoSL doesnt allow slain LTTE cadres to be commemorated. But the knowledge of there being no threat of Tamils returning to an arms struggle against the regime has given rise to a school of thought to give members of this minority community the liberty to commemorate their dead. This is regardless whether the deceased were rebels. Arent family members of slain criminals and murderers allowed to commemorate their dead Commemorating the dead should be viewed from the perspective that all are human beings. This writer remembers reading somewhere that on a prison cell wall in Sri Lanka were written the following words; My mother knows who I am. We have lost so much as a result of the war which was inevitable. But we mustnt lose the human touch we possess under any circumstance. 
President Maithripala Sirisena told the United Nations General Assembly in New York that efforts were being made by his people to consolidate peace and forge ahead. His statement that Sri Lanka didnt wish foreign nations to interfere in finding solutions to the national question might not have gone well with the international community. But the work done by the Government in terms of rehabilitation leaves this regime with the choice of inviting foreign observers to make a visit here and witness the positive work being done.
The late LTTE cadre Thamilni Jeyakkumaran in her book titled Thiyunu Asipathaka Sevana Yata recalls how ex-tiger rebels were taught life skills at Government maintained rehab centres
33,000 unsolved issues
The GoSL recently made aware that officials attached to 53 ministries had conducted a 4-day mobile service in Jaffna to provide solutions to unsolved issues faced by the Tamil community. The authorities had found 33,000 unsolved issues bugging this minority community in the Jaffna peninsular. 
In this context it seems that the presence of the Army in the north makes Tamils irritable. Northern Chief Minister C.V Vigneswaran has openly stated that he wants Army camps removed from the North. But the sporadic violent activities carried out by suspicious armed gangs and the Army Commander looking forward to receiving orders from Colombo to quell them suggest there is tension and ill feeling in the North. The Government must ensure that such an environment doesnt create a situation among the communities akin to simmering ashes under a fire. 
A few days ago there were reports about Sri Lanka being ranked 67th out of 146 countries in a Social Progress Index. But such ratings take mostly material gains welfare measures into consideration. 
The issue we are right now dealing with is associated with tattered minds and a Northern Tamil culture which was almost wiped out. 
Giving the Tamils modern technology and rebuilding the constructions which were destroyed in the conflict will only solve half their problem. Efforts must be taken to give the war-effected Tamils their right space to culturally prosper and start making contributions to the countrys economy. 
Arent family members of slain criminals and murderers allowed to commemorate their dead Commemorating the dead should be viewed from the perspective that all are humanbeings
This is why we should highlight the plight if the Tamils in the north. But in this context it is of concern to see some television channels telecasting stories of yore which highlight how Tamils rebelled against the Sinhalese in greed of the throne. There are also other television series which make the Sinhalese acquire a war mentality. These are quite unwanted at a time when a reconciliation process is in progress. 
Recently an individual from Kandy staged a protest against LTTE atrocities in the past using pictures as the mode of communication. The protester wanted people to be allowed to make representations to the Geneva HRC. Is this the time for this kind of activity
What Sri Lanka needs now is warm hearts and not the opinion of hot-blooded individuals Let the memories of brutalities committed by both sides blow out of our minds and away from this island, like a hurricane would. Let the reconciliation process sow the seeds of permanent peace.

Today is World Animal Day
	

The world we live in has both humans and animals. But over the recent past, we humans seem to have become a threat for these animals, in turn making them a threat to our lives. From the human-elephant conflict to various other issues Sri Lanka has experienced several unexpected scenarios as a result of rapid encroachment and unsustainable approaches in the name of development. Hence on World Animal Day which falls today, lets take a moment to appreciate animals around us who immensely contribute to the environment we live in.
Message from Otara Gunawardene, Ambassador for World Animal Day :
We must take the time to see the trail of suffering we create for animals. Abuse, torture, suffering has gone on for far too long. Because when you see the suffering we cause for innocent beings you just cannot ignore it. But here, we choose to remain ignorant, we choose to not see because it helps us to ignore the cruelty and a lot of the time the truth is hidden and not told or shown, because at the root of it all is profit and money. In the name of fancy cuisine, fashion, entertainment, religion and education the suffering is immense. No one should suffer; we are not superior to another being and we can live extremely well and happily without contributing to the cruelty. I have been a part of this as well. Then the day comes when you suddenly see what you are a part of. I am happy though that the world is changing. The last couple of years there have been great change for the benefit of animals and the movement is continuing to grow. Veganism is growing, many companies are adding on vegan menus and options, fashion brands have made commitments to stop using fur, mohair, rabbit etc,. Meat and milk consumption is dropping and people are moving away from riding elephants or going for events where they and other animals are being used.
Otara further stated that people can bury their head in the sand and pretend its not happening or continue to justify why we need to continue to be cruel, but change is coming. Remaining ignorant or choosing to ignore the suffering really does not make us better people. Even if you want to continue to commit the suffering you need to be conscious to it. Because if you are conscious of it, I am sure the majority will take the steps not to be a part of the cruelty. As a country Sri Lanka is a compassionate country, but we have strayed from it as years have passed; some of it due to influence which was not ours but which has remained and has continued to remain. Its time to go back to our compassionate roots and bring the changes needed where the lives of both people and animals are valued and where they both have equal rights.

Underprivileged kids get a chance at education
     	 
  At the Daily Mirror, we believe that climate change is one of the greatest threats that we, as Sri Lankans, will face in the future.  Therefore, we intend to provide our readers with local and international content with the objective to educate and inspire. We would also like to learn from our valued readers about any ongoing initiatives in making Sri Lanka a more sustainable nation.   
 We aim to explore sustainable ways of living that have the most positive impact on not just our natural environment, but also for humans and animals.  
While topics such as global warming, pollution, and inequality are confronting, we believe it's time the media stopped shying away from these issues and became an active participant in finding solutions - and we hope you will join us. 
     
				 		 
	
	

Tucked away next to St Marys Church in Negombo sits the Yawajeewa Community Learning Centre, an educational haven for disadvantaged children. The students aged 3  16 all live in the area surrounding Negombos fish market and many live on the street or dont have proper care at home. Because of this it makes it difficult for them to attend a mainstream school. The creation and maintenance of the school has come together through local and international groups as well as with the help of St Marys Church who has provided them with the location. As one of their corporate CSR projects, Dutch IT company NIPPUR has provided the finance for a renovation of the kitchen, classroom, toilet/shower block and also provides the children with a hearty lunch every day. Local NGO, Dogstar (primarily an animal welfare charity) became involved in the school when CEO Samantha Green learnt that as only lunch was provided, children were only attending the school to wait for what was possibly their first meal for the day. It was because of this that Dogstar founded the Breakfast Club a chance for children to enjoy a hot breakfast which allows them to be able to concentrate on their morning lessons.
With three full time teachers, the school also receives local and international volunteers that come to teach special skills such as art, yoga or plastic pollution education. Dogstar even runs their Pupstar Club to teach the children how to care for cats and dogs and keep themselves safe around animals. Older children are taught trade skills such as carpentry or tailoring and many children are able to go onto further education or be integrated back into the mainstream education system thanks to Yawajeewa. Differently abled children and those with learning difficulties are welcomed in the school with the main focus is that every child reach their potential and that all their unique gifts be celebrated. The visited the school recently and even though it was school holidays, classes still kick off at 8.30am, 5 days a week. Standing in two straight lines, the children recited their morning prayers before wishing us and their teachers a good morning. Once inside the classroom, they eagerly collected their breakfast of rice with dhal, with many children going back for seconds which was heartening to see. Split into two groups, the younger kids were learning their numbers in Sinhala while the older kids were focusing on math. With bright smiles and cheeky attitudes, it was obvious that the children adored their teachers and enjoyed being in the school. Something as simple as providing two meals a day has such a positive impact on attendance and allows the children reach their full potential as they can focus on their studies and not hungry tummys.
Yawajeewa Community Learning Centre has been essential for the local fish market community - without access to education these children will continue to be trapped in a cycle of poverty and are high risk of developing social problems such as domestic violence, abuse, gambling and drug use as they get older. By providing them with education, food, shelter and love, Yawajeewa is providing them hope for a better future.
The schools next big project is raising enough funds to buy a school bus to allow them to pick up children from areas further away and to build dormitories to prevent those sleeping on the streets with a comfortable and safe place to rest. If you would like to get in touch with Yawajeewa Community Learning Centre and follow their progress you can find them on Facebook.

Unfortunate and unfair to say UN resolution an interference: UK
	
UKs Minister of State for Asia-Pacific at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Mark Field, ahead of a visit to Sri Lanka, said that it is unfortunate and unfair to represent the Geneva resolution as interference by the international community in Sri Lankas domestic affairs.
The UK Ministers visit follows President Maitripala Sirisenas speech last week at the UN General Assembly where he urged the international community to allow Sri Lankan people to solve their problems on their own and as an independent country it did not want any foreign power to exert influence on it.
UKs Minister Mark Field who will be arriving in the country this eveningsaid in an op-ed article to the Daily Mirror: There are also those who like to represent the Geneva resolution in particular as interference by the international community in Sri Lankas domestic affairs. This is unfortunate and unfair. The UK, along with many other friends of Sri Lanka, continues to warmly endorse the governments principled decision to co-sponsor a resolution that provides a valuable framework for peacebuilding and reconciliation.
Next March the UNHRC will assess the progress Sri Lanka has made. In Colombo I will be urging the government to drive forward its reconciliation efforts with a clear plan for delivery, and offering the UKs steadfast support for their efforts, he said.
So what will I be focusing on specifically when in Colombo this week 
Finding the truth is fundamental. The experience of countries that have recovered  or are recovering  from conflict around the world is that this is essential to restoring real confidence among communities, between citizens and the armed forces, and between voters and governments. To this end, I would like to see much more progress on national accountability and truth-seeking mechanisms that Sri Lanka committed to in 2015.
"The Prevention of Terrorism Act is something I am regularly asked about by the diaspora and others here in the UK. We would like to see it replaced, as part of wider security sector reform, with a new Counter-Terrorism Act which meets international standards. I am glad that the UK has been able to share its experiences in this area. 
"There is also an ongoing process to consider reform to important provisions of the Constitution, including devolution of political authority. I hope that a way forward can be found on this central issue."

It is the responsibility of the UNP to safeguard President Maithripala Sirisena, Home Affairs Deputy Minister J. C. Alawathuwala said today.
It is the UNP who got President Sirisena elected as the President of this country and therefore our party cannot have any intention of getting him killed. Therefore the allegation that the UNP is behind the plot to assassinate him is baseless, the Deputy Minister said.
He said the investigations on the alleged plot are continuing without any political interference.
Also he refuted reports that there is a serious rift between the President and the Prime Minister.
One should understand that the government is run by two parties and naturally there are debates and arguments in such a situation. Both the SLFP and UNP debate and argue on policies and ensure that people are benefited, he said in this regard. (Yohan Perera)

Why does reconciliation in Sri Lanka matter to the UK
	
Minister Field and High Commissioner James Dauris visiting a mine field
Next year Sri Lanka will have enjoyed 10 uninterrupted years free from the misery of armed conflict. Whatever your view on how Sri Lanka has progressed since, that very fact alone is one to cherish. I know how deep the scars from decades of conflict run. When I visited last year I heard first-hand from the families of disappeared persons. It was a stark reminder of how much all communities in Sri Lanka have suffered. 
I was delighted to be coming back to Sri Lanka. This will be my second in 12 months as Minister for Asia and the Pacific, and it would be all too easy to simply look forward to Englands tour of Sri Lanka, and what a timely celebration that series will be of the enormous goodwill in the UK for Sri Lanka, its people and its culture. 
But I want to use this opportunity to take a hard look at the distance Sri Lanka has travelled since the war ended, and the path ahead. In my conversations with the government I will be commending the progress made on the commitments it made to the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in 2015 and 2017, while urging greater and faster progress where they have not been met. 
First, it is important to recognize the positives. The UK did just this at the September session of the UNHRC in Geneva, along with the co-sponsors of Resolution 34/1, Germany, Macedonia and Montenegro.
The Office on Missing Persons (OMP) has begun its work. We stand with everyone able to show the courage and determination to advance the Offices work, and I am looking forward to meeting some of the Commissioners while I am in Colombo.
There has also been progress on returning private land in the north to its owners, with further commitments to return more land that today is still occupied by the military. The UK has been supporting this effort. In Muhumalai, in the Kilinochchi district, I heard last year from families benefiting from land returns and the work of the HALO trust, a UK-funded de-mining charity. Just this August we announced a further 1.4 million to support further de-mining and resettlement; a tangible demonstration of our continued commitment to supporting the people of Sri Lanka.
There is an ongoing process to consider reform to important provisions of the Constitution, including devolution of political authority
But I must be candid with you: the pace of progress on a number of key issues remains much slower than we had hoped for. I know, not least from the UKs experience in Northern Ireland, that it is not easy dealing with the legacy of conflict between communities. Time helps, but time alone does not heal all wounds. And as time passes, lack of progress in delivering key steps can undermine communities confidence in reconciliation efforts. It can lessen the positive impact of good work that is done too. 
So what will I be focusing on specifically when in Colombo this week 
Finding the truth is fundamental. The experience of countries that have recovered  or are recovering  from conflict around the world is that this is essential to restoring real confidence among communities, between citizens and the armed forces, and between voters and governments. To this end, I would like to see much more progress on national accountability and truth-seeking mechanisms that Sri Lanka committed to in 2015.
The Prevention of Terrorism Act is something I am regularly asked about by the diaspora and others here in the UK. We would like to see it replaced, as part of wider security sector reform, with a new Counter-Terrorism Act which meets international standards. I am glad that the UK has been able to share its experiences in this area. 
There is also an ongoing process to consider reform to important provisions of the Constitution, including devolution of political authority. I hope that a way forward can be found on this central issue. 
Some ask why any of this should matter to the UK. There are also those who like to represent the Geneva resolution in particular as interference by the international community in Sri Lankas domestic affairs. This is unfortunate and unfair. The UK, along with many other friends of Sri Lanka, continues to warmly endorse the governments principled decision to co-sponsor a resolution that provides a valuable framework for peacebuilding and reconciliation. 
Progress here will help us discuss much more: from post-Brexit trade, education, to the Commonwealth, security in the Indian Ocean, and tackling serious organised crime. 
Next March the UNHRC will assess the progress Sri Lanka has made. In Colombo I will be urging the government to drive forward its reconciliation efforts with a clear plan for delivery, and offering the UKs steadfast support for their efforts. 
Sri Lanka still has an historic opportunity to take the steps necessary to build enduring stability and prosperity. I firmly believe this is the future that the vast majority of Sri Lankans want, whether they be at home or overseas, and we all have a part to play in achieving that shared goal.

China offers lessons on  saving the panda
	
When one talks about China there is a beautiful animal with a peculiar colour combination of black and white which pops up in our minds; the panda. This animal has been one of main symbols of China in many ways than one. In one way they are a treasure for China in terms of tourism. Sometimes this adorable animal helps China to improve its international relations. There are more than 10 countries in the world who were gifted with pandas by the Chinese Government, mainly to improve relationships. So the panda is an important animal for China in many aspects. 
Panda conversation
Although the panda is a key icon of the whole of China, currently this animal is living in only 3 provinces in this country. 80% of the pandas are living in the beautiful province of Sichuan situated in the South West of China. When China started its conservation programme in middle of the 20th Century there were less than 800 pandas in the wild. There was a huge workload to be done to stop this animal from extinction. There were huge challenges to overcome. Other than the human threat there were many natural problems stifling the panda conversation programme. 
After the artificial insemination was founded the number of pandas was risen rapidly. They have made agreements with several world class organisations
Challenges
Though panda is a carnivore animal 98 % of its daily diet consists of bamboo plants. Since the energy content of bamboo is really poor pandas have to eat more than 30 kg of bamboos to fulfill their daily energy needs. The bamboo coverage is diminishing and this is exposing the pandas to danger. Also Pandas are very lazy. They are not fast moving animals. Panda couples are even lazy to mate. This also contributes to the threats they face. According to scientists female pandas mate just 36 hours for the whole year. Panda mothers always give birth to two cubs, but she has the habit of feeding only the strongest cub. So in the wild one cub faces premature death. After considering all of these facts the Chinese authorities have decided to start conserving pandas through captive breeding. 
Breeding andresearch centre
China began captive breeding of pandas in 1955. The Chengdu Panda Research and breeding centre which was commenced in 1987 is a major part of this programme. It was founded with 6 pandas who survived the wild conditions. The number of pandas living in Chengdu Breeding Centre rose to130 in 2008. 
Even during the early days, when they were attempting panda conversation, they had much issues with technology, but Chinas rapid development in technology has given panda conversation a real boost.
Chengdu Panda Breeding Centre possesses the worlds top and latest scientific resources and the Chinese Government is investing large amounts of money to save this valuable animal. In the 1970s the rate of baby panda survival was just 30% and with these new resources it has increased up to 90%. This shows huge development. Currently the world largest collection of Artificially inseminated animal collection is available in this captive area for pandas. 
Chengdu and Panda
This facility is located just 10km from Chinas best commercial hub, Chengdu City Centre. The pandas at Chengdu Panda Breeding Centre offer huge value for tourism in Sichuan province. The panda base in Chengdu consists of 92 acres and that area consists 10,000 clumps of bamboos which form the diet and habitat for these animals. The breeding centre is planning to expand its area by another 500 acres so as to prepare the pandas to be released to the wild. 
Chengdu Panda Breeding & Research Centre through its work has increased the survival rate of this much loved animal
Worlds only thematic museum
The giant panda museum of Chengdu Panda Research Centre was found in 1993 to improve the public awareness of saving both panda animals and their environment. This is the worlds only Thematic museum for such a rare and endangered animal species. The museum consists of 10,000 samples of mainly pandas, but there are also samples and fossils of other animals like birds and insects which were collected in Sichuan Province. 
Partnerships with world class organisations
After the artificial insemination was founded the number of pandas was risen rapidly. And to improve the research and technology of this base, they had made agreements with several world class organisations including East Bay Zoological Society California- USA, University of Liverpool, Nihon University Japan etc. The protection of baby pandas is and another huge task which is successfully being done at this base. Panda cubs when born are blind and hairless and their size is just 1/900 of their mothers. So these naturally weak cubs have a remote chance of living long in the wild. But within the panda base they are scientifically protected. Also inside this centre both cubs have the chance to live long. 10 years ago the panda base started offering lifeline to one of these cubs who was ignored by the mother. Now this weak one has become a strong male panda. The name Scientists have given him is Miracle. 
The focus of the Chinese Government on animal conservation through Chengdu Panda Research and breeding is really huge. These are lessons to the world. When countries develop they lose their focus on animal conservation. But it is nice to see a country like china which is making fast development in technology and trade but not losing its focus on animal conservation.

CVs vehicle shot down by Cabinet
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswarans request for approval to import a super luxury vehicle at a cost of US$ 60,000 (Rs. 102,00,000 approximately) had been rejected by the Cabinet on Tuesday (02) Cabinet Spokesman Dr Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
He told the media at yesterdays Cabinet news briefing that the Government could not afford the extra luxury to Wigneswaran while suspending vehicle imports for Ministers, MPs and public servants who were entitled to tax-free vehicle imports.
Co-Cabinet Spokesman, Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said 228 Parliamentarians and nearly 8,000 Public Servants had already imported vehicles on duty-free permits. Another 5,000 public servants were still to put order to import duty-free vehicles.
The Government would relax restrictions on vehicle imports after six months and I believe the situation would be improved by December with the drop of fuel prices in the global market and the rupee becoming steady against the dollar, Minister Senaratne said.
He added that the prices of essential commodities were still lower than the process before 2015 and added the budget 2019 would be a relief budget giving people a lot of benefits.
Minister Senaratne flatly rejected the notion that the Cost of Living and prices of essential commodities were much higher than the prices in 2014 and also that a large majority of people were struggling to make ends meet under the prevailing economic situation in the country.
Responding to a journalists suggestion that the Police had failed to contain the underworld and crime wave in the North and as such the Sri Lanka Army had appealed the Government to give armed forces personnel to control crimes in the north, Minister Senaratne said the Army had helped the Police to control public unrest and crimes right throughout since Independence.
But the Sri Lanka Army under this Government will not kill people when they stage protests like the Rajapaksa Government did at Rathupaswala and Katunayake, he stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

## Title: English or Kadda What shall it be
## Section: News Features

English or Kadda What shall it be
	
kadda is a corruption of kaduwa and it is derived from the saying kadden kotanawa (using language as a sword to brush away people)


In a speech titled Can the Subaltern Speak English delivered at the International Centre for Ethnic Studies in Kandy on August 9, Dhanuka Bandara takes to task those he sees as academic messiahs who write about emancipating the marginalised Other who cannot wield English as the privileged can. For Dhanuka, such messianism is a cover for crass careerism, a path to de-hegemonisation of language standards that promotes traditional intellectuals (reactionary appendages of dominant minorities) over organic intellectuals (at the forefront of social change). Such careerists can only speak of the marginalised Other (the native non-English speaker) in terms they can relate to, based overwhelmingly on Western scholarship.
Over the course of his speech Dhanuka refers to, among others, Arjuna Parakrama, Godfrey Gunatilleke, and the late Manique Gunasekara, and contends that the work of these three intellectuals revolves around one pressing question: how does one deliver an English education to a country to which English has always been at best an alien experience, and if so, how can one deliver it via an authentic  Lankan experience 
Parakrama condemns the inability of English educationalists to relate what is taught to the society around them (because of texts which overwhelmingly relate foreign items, from fruits to films), an issue that is supplemented by an even bigger one: the current paradigm that Lankan history is the triumphal march of Buddhism. In other words, according to Parakrama, not only is the rural student unaware of what is taught in English textbooks, he is made to grapple with another tier of exclusion: the Sinhala Buddhist hegemony that holds sway over our education system.
Dhanukas issue with this line of thinking is that, at one level, it is a promotion of a way of teaching English that limits the rural childs way of seeing. Which is true, I should think. Much of the discourse surrounding English Our Way (which Malinda Seneviratne tore to pieces years ago), after all, is rooted in the assumption that we should all speak English the way we and our countrymen want, free of grammatical and syntactical constraints. This culture of linguistic licentiousness has, at the end of the day, the effect of promoting a rift between those who speak and those who spik, between those who can wield the language and those who can barely put two words together. Dhanukas speech in that sense sheds light on another aspect of this debate: are those who idolise Sri Lankan English, as Orwell once put it, saints who should be judged guilty until they are proven innocent
Dhanuka himself an eloquent writer of English that he is, he came from a Sinhala speaking background, didnt go to a popular or private school,
In my experience so far, limited though it is, English education is not a problem prefixed by social class and background. At a basic level, there are poor children, coming from rural backgrounds, who can speak the language better than their more privileged counterparts from the city. It is also not a problem of experience, which means that the debate over whether our textbooks should limit the items and other things (again, from fruits to films) to what is local is actually a nonentity.
Dhanuka himself is a case in point: eloquent writer of English that he is, he came from a Sinhala speaking background, didnt go to a popular or private school, and learnt the language on his own. But then, as he points out, he first experienced snow two years ago and learnt by rote Robert Frosts Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening in Grade Eleven, and yet [did] not recall any particular difficulty relating to it.
I myself can think of several encounters Ive had with students who, while alienated from foreign experiences, nevertheless relate to them quite instinctively. (Just get them to watch an American thriller film and youll see how they react.) Neither social class nor inability to relate to foreign experiences, factors though they may be, seems then to have much of a say in determining why one class grows up ignorant of English and another grows up wielding it as though it were the most natural thing.
The issue of class, in the context of English education, has been examined from every angle by scholars like Parakrama and Gunasekara. Parakramas didactic assessments of this problem (read his essay Naduth Unge Baduth Unge: Some Thoughts on the Language of Privilege and the Privileges of Language, which Dhanuka refers to in his speech) can be simplified to an observation Doric de Souza once made: that the items exhibited in English textbooks are outside the frame of reference of the typical Sri Lankan child. Parakrama offers a more academic take on this:
There is no room for the radical alterity of these who are not caught within the nexus of power/access to power/the possibility of access to power in the future. For those outside the pale, as it were, the logic of resistance and protest as we understand it does not clinch. For this group for whom the trendy term would be subaltern, other paradigms of resistance and protest need to be conceptualized, since, to echo Ranajith Guha, there is dominancewithout hegemony.
In other words, the subaltern, who happen to be the majority, are denied the very tools of resistance which a proper English education should equip them with. English in this sense can be both a kaduwa (oppressive) and a hiramanaya (utilitarian), and in the right hands, it can turn from the one to the other.
The reductionism of this Elite/Other dichotomy is felt in every debate, but nowhere else has it been felt more than in the debate over English education. What it does, as Dhanuka and other scholars opposed to the tenets of Sri Lankan English have argued, is to presume the ignorance of the rural child and the eliteness of the urban child, and the God given right of academics to safeguard the innocence of the rural child by (inadvertently) preserving the rift between him and his urban counterpart, when the reality can and should be quite different. Or as Dhanuka puts it:
... the assumption is that so called subalterns remain as empty vessels, they do not have the language to curse, are bereft of means of resistance, unless they receive their liberation as a benevolent gift from those who oppress them.
Given that I certainly am not up to the task of examining this issue from an academic standpoint, a few heretical thoughts on the way English is viewed by the typical child, and the gradation in perceptions, prejudices, and perspectives regarding the subject of English between the rural and the urban child, are, I feel, called for.
The typical Sinhala speaking student (I unfortunately have not had encounters with Tamil speaking students, yet) has a name for English in their dictionary: kadda. It is a corruption of kaduwa and it is derived from the saying kadden kotanawa (using language as a sword to brush away people).
Interestingly enough, perhaps owing to the culture of complacency regarding the teaching of the language weve institutionalised over the decades, kadda is not a term of disparagement or fear. On the contrary, it is used whimsically, not to ridicule the non speaker of English, but to refer to and ridicule the speaker. (Whenever I pick up the phone and speak in front of them, I hear their giggles as they try to imitate me and poke fun at the mistakes they make.) The young non English speaker no longer regrets his lack of English education; he laughs at it and that by consciously laughing at the errors he commits. Be it Royal College or Kekirawa Central, this process plays out in almost exactly the same way.
This presents us with rather interesting cultural phenomena, the way I see it: the ability of the non English speaking child to compensate for his failure to wield the language by resorting to a colloquialism with obvious colonial overtones (kaduwa as a term of disparagement of English traces its roots to postcolonial Ceylonese society) while being indifferent to or ignorant of those same overtones. In other words, the Sinhala speaking child views English through a dualistic lens: he realises its importance in a society that prioritises spoken over written English (most of the students I interviewed wanted to speak and pronounce, not to read and write), but he no longer views it as the step up the social ladder it used to be before.
Ironically, globalisation, which has advertised elocution in our society (which belong to the outer circle of Braj Kachrus World Englishes model), is to blame for that: it has made it possible for the non English speaker to let go of the language, since he seeks other ways of climbing that ladder: through material things that are marketed day in and day out, rather than through ideas.
Dhanukas speech thus stands out because the Elite/Other dichotomy no longer holds water, since English is no longer the dominant hegemony it used to be. 50 years ago, the English speaker was privileged. He still is today, but the structures of poverty in our society have emboldened the non English speaker to ignore his ignorance and yet enjoy the good life. As a final point, we can therefore say that the non English speaker, regardless of whether he attends Royal College or Kekirawa Central, has succeeded in compensating for his weakness in the language via casual, illusory self-mockery. This, for me, is the real tragedy we should be looking at.

Fr. Egerton Perera  A glimpse into the life of an exemplary human being
	
To have known a human being that was so content with his existence, a life lived to the full, which was shared with all who encountered him with warm smile that it left them filled with love, is truly a blessing. Fr. Egerton Perera, whom I encountered first as the chaplain at the University of Peradeniya in 2002, and later became my dear friend was such a rare person. I cannot recall a single time that I didnt have a smile after meeting him. I think most of us who were members of the Newman Society at the University of Peradeniya during the 18 years that he was Chaplain will attest to this. 
Fr. Egerton had three great loves in his life. His love for our Lord Jesus Christ was number one, his love for the University of Peradeniya and the Newman Society and his unmistakble love for people. Whenever I met him, he would share these three loves with me through sharing of his experiences.
As a Catholic and a Jesuit priest he had seen and tasted the Lord. He used to tell me that he starts preparing for his Sunday homily the Monday before. His homilies were always refreshing and unconventional. They opened our eyes to a different dimension or a different view point. One of his famous explanations were of sin. He would say sin is God is telling me to go this way, but I take another way. Simple and clear. This is one of the reasons that I did not return home from the University during the weekends and remained to attend the mass at the Chaplaincy. Being a retreat director in the Ignatian tradition and a well-read person Fr. Egerton incorporated ideas from the works of St. Ignatius Loyola, Cardinial Henry Newman, Anthony de Mello, Thomas Merton, Henri Nouwen and Rabindranath Tagore in his homilies and discussions. He encouraged us to read beyond our subject specialities. He used to tease the dental students saying Ubala dath 32 vitharak igena gena hariyanne ne. He used to receive magazines such as Time and National Geographic, and he would ask me to read certain articles that were interesting. He would share whatever knowledge he gained from these and other sources with us and it encouraged me to take on a habit of reading. 
Sin is God is telling me to go this way, but I take another way. Simple and clear. This is one of the reasons that I did not return home from the University during the weekends and remained to attend the mass atthe Chaplaincy
Through Father and the Alumni of the Newman Society we were exposed to the history of the University of Peradeniya. Fr. Egerton being a graduate of Peradeniya himself was absolutely in love with the campus and the environment. He would watch the birds, take walks through the campus and pray on the Akbar Bridge while the Mahaweli flowed peacefully. This love was so contagious that I too ended up having a deep love for the University. I learned to appreciate the blessing that I received of being a scholar at this prestigious and uniquely beautiful University through him. Being a qualified counsellor, Chartered Accountant, an Economics graduate and a Jesuit priest himself, Fr. Egerton always encouraged us to excel in our chosen fields. He would say If you are a physicist you should be an expert in physics, no less. Being an expert in the English language he would help us with our writing and speaking. He was very concerned on the quality of education that we received and always encouraged us to have an integral formation through taking part in exposure programmes, national workshops, sports, and other extra curricular activities. Such activities were part and parcel of the Newman society calendar during his tenure as Chaplain. As the Catholic Chaplain he worked tirelessly to keep the legacy of Fr. Pinto the founder of the Newman Society alive. He made sure we knew the history of this great University and the Newman Society through incorporating articles to the annual publication of the Newman Society, the Horizon.
As a priest I should know my flock. This was Fr. Egertons principle wherever he served. While the president of the Newman society I accompanied him when he visited students at their residence halls. He would inquire about the students welfare, their families and any hardships they had. He would say that he felt and looked younger by being with us. Every Sunday after mass he would host us for tea. He would share what ever he had. We were often treated with a home-made Saruwath drink which was one of his favourites. He knew that young University students we were always in haamathe. So he would invite us for a meal cooked by him whenever possible. We were fortunate to have had many of his favourite dishes such as the pol-kiri baduma.
A fund dedicated to the memory of Fr. Pinto was founded by Fr. Egerton to assist students with financial need. Through this fund he helped many Catholic and non-Catholic University students islandwide during their period of study at the University. Every year during the Christmas holidays Fr. Egerton would visit students at their homes, be they in Jaffna or Matara. I had the opportunity accompany him during some of these visits and every home we visited offered Christmas treats of which he took very little since he would visit so many homes. These visits gave father the insight into the families of the students and this enabled him to assist them at their time in the University. He would have all the contact numbers of the families with him so that in an emergency he could directly contact them. 
Fr. Egerton was also a qualified counsellor. He completed his Masters in Counselling at Loyala University in Chicago. Through his intervention many students in the campus were assisted in their personal challenges. He imparted his counselling traits in helping with our personal relationships and always knew exactly what to do or say to ease a situation. He would always advise us to listen and accompany the other person. 
Before undertaking the role of the Chaplain at the University, Fr. Egerton served as Parish Priest in a simple and poor farming village named Blackpool near Nuwara Eliya. He loved the people there and would share his experiences with them with us, the students of the Newman society. During his time at the University he organized several exposure programmes to Blackpool. In one of these programmes I got to experience the simplicity and honesty of the people in this village and Fr. Egertons love for people.
He was very concerned on the quality of education that we received and always encouraged us to have an integral formation through taking part in exposure programmes, national workshopsand sports
Most of his flock at Peradeniya considered Fr. Egerton to be their second father. To most of us including me he tied the knot at our weddings. A few of us including me were fortunate to do a one day retreat with him just before our wedding. Eventually when we had kids he was one of the first to know and he would tell everyone that he had another grandson or a granddaughter. I remember I put him up in the wee hours of the morning when my son was born to tell him the news. He was a mentor to us even in our marriage life giving tips in parenting and making priorities. He of course never approved single kid families and would slowly put the idea to have another kid, which most of us ended up having and he would boast this to be the result of his coaxing.
As an expert writer Fr. Egerton wrote many articles on Human values, University education, University students etc. Over 50 articles were published in the Daily Mirror which were also compiled in to Two books. One titled The marvel of being human and the other Challenges and rewards of being human. These give an inside view to his immense love of Humanity. As Father departs this wonderful human existence he leaves behind the warmth and love that he shared and the countless memories he made which would keep alive his memory in us. As always in his last days he shared his passion for the Lord and for his people. He was impatient to join the Lord while I cringed at the idea of losing him. Through his life he challenges us to appreciate this gift of the Human life, to share it and encourage others to be more human as he exemplified. I sincerely hope as his dear sons and daughters that we will make him proud.

JO alleges govt. behind Digana violence
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) today alleged it is now being revealed that some government forces had a hand behind the communal violence in Digana, Kandy earlier this year, as claimed recently by the Anti-Corruption Movement.
JO MP Shehan Semasinghe told a news conference that as revealed there was an alleged assassination plot on President Maithripala Sirisena and former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa whereby some more revelations had been made on communal violence in Digana.
It was revealed that some top officials of the Police were behind this incident. Accordingly, it can be believed that the government is behind it. The circumstances are similar with regard to the violence in Aluthgama in 2014, he said.
The government is using such third class politics to win elections whilst attempting to create racial disturbances in society, he added.
He also said the government was maintaining a lethargic policy with regard to the investigations on the alleged assassination plot despite it being a serious matter where several senior police officers had been allegedly involved.
Meanwhile, he alleged the underworld had become the guardian of the government and added there was rapid increase in crimes during past two years.
There had been more than 290 killings in 2017 whilst more than 325 killings were reported in 2018. Around 1,900 drug related serious cases were reported in last nine months of 2018 too. There is no justifiable response from the Police with this regard, he said.(Kalathma Jayawardhane)

JO wants President to walk the talk
	
President Maithripala Sirisena should take immediate action with regard to serious issues, such as the economic crisis and the alleged assassination plot, instead of complaining or making mere statements, the Joint Opposition (JO) said yesterday.
JO MP C.B. Ratnayake said if President Sirisena was against the fuel pricing formula and the depreciation of the rupee, he should intervene to defeat Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweeras budget for the next year.
The President should also take serious action over the assassination plot in which IGP Pujith Jayasundara is also allegedly involved, he said.
Berating the IGP is not good enough. Action should be taken, he said.
Meanwhile, MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said the President should remove Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as it was the Premier, who has made financial decisions, which led to the economic turmoil the country was in today.
The Premier should take responsibility of current economic crisis, he said.
It was the Prime Minister, along with his friends such as Minister Malik Samarawickrama and R. Paskaralingam, made key economic decisions. It was the Premier who appointed Arjuna Mahendran as Central Bank Governor amidst protests and paved the way for the bond scam.
The bond scam is one of the reasons why the rupee is depreciating. If he doesnt resign, the President should remove him, he said.
He said the best option available to salvage the economy was to replace the Government with a Mahinda Rajapaksa-led administration.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Link more with Japan to face crisis: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had told a group of Ministers and economic experts that Sri Lanka should enhance its economic and trade ties with Japan as a precaution for the ongoing economic crisis.
Prime Minister had expressed these sentiments at a meeting he had with a group of Ministers and experts on the current economic situation prior to his departure to Norway.
He has told the Ministers and experts that Sri Lanka should enhance its economic and trade ties with Japan as that country was the only country, which has managed to maintain its currency to some extent in the wake of devaluation as a result of strengthening the dollar.
The Prime Minister has said that Sri Lanka should try to attract more investments from Japan.
Meanwhile, Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that Sri Lanka had taken timely action to get Japanese assistance for the development of Kandy.
He has said more investments would come in from Japan as a result.
One of the main projects that have been lined up is converting Bogambara Prison as a tourist centre and the expanding of the Kandy City limits up to Kundasale. (Yohan Perera)

Modi wants SL political parties to have dialogues with  the separate  Indian states  - Douglas
	
Leader of Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) MP Douglas Devananda, in an interview with , speaks about his recent visit to India along with a parliamentary delegation headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.

Urges Modi to develop Palali airport and KKS Port
	There is a lull in Tamil Nadu politics
	Urges India to help implement 13 A in full
Excerpts of this interview:
Q You recently took part in a visit to India as part of a parliamentary delegation and met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. What is your assessment of the visit
As far as a visit to India is concerned, I had two issues. One is that the Tamil opposition accused me of a person barred by India. According to them, I was a proclaimed offender. They said I had committed non-bailable offences. So, it was a good opportunity for me to go as a result. Otherwise, I am not interested in undertaking foreign visits as such unless they are beneficial enough. In India, I got the chance to visit the Prime Minister, the Foreign Affairs Minister, the President and the main opposition parties. Other than that, I, alone, met with the MPs from Tamil Nadu representing DMK, AIADMK and the Communist Party. I met these people in Chennai after I concluded my stay in New Delhi. This is the first time I went there after 2010.
QWhat is their opinion of Sri Lankan Tamil issue
Now, DMK leader M. Karunanidhi is not there. Also, Jayalalitha Jeyaram of AIADMA is no longer there. There is a kind of a political lull as a result in Tamil Nadu. I informed the Indian leaders including the Prime Minister that I would welcome the new Constitution if it happened. But, it wont happen anytime soon. Until such times, for the issue of Tamil speaking people, the 13th Amendment should be implemented in full. I have been telling this since 1987. If the new constitution is worked out, it will have to be passed with a two-thirds approval in Parliament. Besides, it should be put to approval of the people by referendum. Yet, the 13th Amendment is part of the present Constitution. There is no need to have further parliamentary approval to implement it. People in the South also benefit from the provincial council system at the moment. They wont object to that. India has supported it. Once the understanding between the Sinhala and Tamil communities is built, we can move forward for further arrangements. 
QWe learnt that you made some requests to the Indian Prime Minister. What are they
I stressed the need to implement the 13th Amendment in full. We ourselves have to solve our problems. That is my position. Literally speaking, we have to deliver our baby. India can only play the role of midwife. In my parliamentary speeches, I repeatedly said that the Sri Lankan government should engage not only with the Indian central government but also with the state government of Tamil Nadu. Only then would we be able to settle our problems. Mr. Modi himself said it there. He asks us to have dialogues with the different state governments of India including Tamil Nadu, not solely with the central government in New Delhi. 
There are a lot of Sri Lankan Tamil expatriates living in India. They find it difficult to get exit permits. I asked India to ease the process for them. If these people want to come and settle in Sri Lanka, they should be given livelihood facilities here. The Modi government was requested to help the war-affected people here. 
I asked the Indian Prime Minister to help upgrade the Palaly airport and the Kankesanthurai harbour. Tamil Nadu is one of the fastest growing states in India. Today, there are a lot of items being imported from Tamil Nadu - food, textiles etc. If they are imported directly through the KKS harbour, the cost will be lower. It will generate employment for thousands of people in Tamil Nadu.
I will improve connectivity with India not only for people in Tamil Nadu but also for those in Anuradhapura, Trincomalee etc.
QSo, you asked for air connectivity
Yes. That is to connect with cities such as Chennai and Trichy. 
QHow do you read Indias interests in Sri Lanka
As far as geopolitics is concerned, India has security concerns. India will look at it from that angle. India is a regional power. 
QYou advocated the provincial council system right from 1987. The Northern Provincial Council will stand dissolved soon. After that, there is no provincial political authority. What do you feel about this
It will be there under the Governor. I think it will be there. Without the elected council in the past, we did a lot of work under then Governor Gen. G.A. Chandrasiri. He gave a lot of help to the people. He is a disciplined person and a hard worker. We did so much in the north under him. 
Earlier, they complained about the absence of an elected council. They whipped up peoples motions and secured power at the elected council. But, there is nothing done for the people. 
There are only frauds and misuse of power. They cannot complain that the central government is not sending money. If there is no money sent, how can they commit financial frauds They confuse themselves. 
QIf the council can be run with a governor, it gives credence to the allegation that the provincial council system is a white elephant. What is your response
Tamil people want devolution of power. For other people, let them decide what they want!
QWhat is your assessment of the current situation of the country
Today, the dollar rate has hit above 170. It may go up to 200. It is a very bad situation. There is a problem internationally. The two main parties are there in the national government. Two swords cannot be kept in one case. One should be there to work out a solution to the national question. Another one should look after economic affairs and all else. Today, we find officials not cooperating with the government. They are scared because some top officials were taken into custody. The government is in a difficult situation to move forward. 
QHow do you look at the next elections to be conducted in 2019
In the south, it will be a crucial election. Only after the budget, we can see what is going to happen. I do not want to be involved in political conflicts in the south. I abstained from voting on the motion to suspend MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Prasanna Ranaweera for two weeks. They might have done something wrong. They should be warned but not punished like this. I abstained from voting. 
QHow do you view the political issues in the north
I am thinking of contesting as a candidate for the chief ministers post. I have been in the central administration for a long period. Now the time is right to do otherwise. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) will be split into two. The TNA promised to deliver what is impractical at the moment. 
Divisions within the TNA are very serious. They openly criticize each other. In politics, there are no permanent enemies or friends. 
QThe TNA had such differences in the past. But, they used to shed differences during election times. Wont it happen this time 
The LTTE was there at that time. Now the LTTE is no longer there. The TNA was like a bag of potatoes held tight at that time. Today, the bag is unpacked. Potatoes are scattered all over. No one is there to collect them. Tamil politicians such as Gajendra Kumar Ponnambalam, V. Anandasangari and Suresh Premachandran were there. Now, they have formed their ownpolitical entities.

MR asks MS to pullout SLFP prop supporting govt.
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday that the President should now pullout the SLFP prop that is supporting the government.
He said the UNP could not run the government alone and added that the government was sustaining because of the SLFP support.
This government is running due to the SLFP prop. It is time to pullout that prop. We all say that time has come for the President to pullout that prop, he said during the opening of the Mahinda Rajapaksa Public Library in Ganemulla, Gampaha.
He said the government claimed that the rupee depreciated against the US dollar due to the loans obtained during his time and the decisions taken by US President Donald Trump.
There was a time when the dollar was strengthened. When the economies of other countries including Asia were collapsing, Sri Lanka stood steady, he said.

Non-violence mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction
	
Tuesday, October 2 marked the United Nations International Day of Non-Violence. It is the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, leader of the Indian independence movement and pioneer of the philosophy and strategy of non-violence or Satyagraha.
In a message UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres says Mahatma Gandhi proved that non-violence could change history. Let us be inspired by his courage and conviction as we continue our work to advance peace, sustainable development and human rights for all of people of the world, he adds.
The UN says that according to a General Assembly Resolution passed on June 15, 2007, the International Day is an occasion to disseminate the message of non-violence, including through education and public awareness. The resolution reaffirms the universal relevance of the principle of non-violence and the desire to secure a culture of peace, tolerance, understanding and non-violence.
Introducing the resolution in the General Assembly on behalf of 140 co-sponsors, Indias External Affairs Deputy Minister Anand Sharma said that the wide and diverse sponsorship of the resolution was a reflection of the universal respect for Mahatma Gandhi and of the enduring relevance of his philosophy. Quoting the late leaders own words, he said: non-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of the people. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction. That means non-violence is mightier than thousands of nuclear weapons possessed by nine countries including Mahathma Gandhis own country India and its neighbour Pakistan.
Reports say the United States and Russia have nuclear weapons which are thousands of times more powerful than the atom bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.Those weapons were intended to end the war and indeed they did. But ending the war and restoring peace are two different issues. Restoring peace requires non-violence, poverty alleviation through a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources and full-scale participation in the battle against global warming or climate change.
After Mahatma Gandhi the world saw only two figures who rose to that height of noble leadership. They were Martin Luther King junior and South Africas legendary Nelson Mandela. Unfortunately in the new millennium we see hardly anyone of that stature in the political field but instead we saw the United States producing a leader like Donald Trump who is known to be impulsive, dangerously unpredictable and inconsistent in a manner that has left the democratic free world without leadership.
In Sri Lanka we have all four major religions, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. All those religious leaders have stressed that violence does not cease by violence but by dialogue and love just as hatred does not cease by hatred but by love and goodwill.
Despite this we have gone through a devastating 26-year civil war, racial riots in 1958, 1977 and 1983 along with youth insurrections in 1971 and in 1987-89. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed or injured in these violent conflicts while millions were displaced or left to languish in varying degrees of degradation, deprivation and destitution.
What happens to all these religious teachings, where did we go wrong and who was responsible Even today, though in 2015 the coalition Government pledged to bring about reconciliation and a lasting peace through justice and an all-inclusive society, we see certain sections trying to whip up religious or racial tension.
We hope the life-changing and world-changing Gandhi Jayanthi message will become part of the policy of all main parties and their leadership though on both sides mindless extremists may try to create trouble. It would be a wise move to include Mahatma Gandhis message in the curriculum of higher grades in schools and in universities so that the youth or the future generations would become aware and act on the power of non-violence.
As the UN says the principle of non-violence  also known as non-violent resistance  rejects the use of physical violence to achieve social or political change. Often described as the politics of ordinary people, this form of non-violent social struggle has been adopted by mass populations all over the world in campaigns for social justice.

Notes for a Manifesto:  National Security
	
The word brings to mind guns and barricades, soldiers and war (in the immediate past, lived through or imminent). Thats natural in a land where several generations have had guns and bombs in-their-faces, literally and figuratively. Natural also in a world that has become small courtesy of communication technology and therefore has war delivered to the palm, so to speak, or obtained with a swipe.
It is not surprising that national security has mostly been associated with the protection of the state or rather the incumbent government, even though it is frequently tagged with the people and the nation. Is security about these things alone, though 
The word comes from the Latin Securus meaning free from care and evolved through the Latin word Securita and the Old French Securite to Secure in English and Security in late Middle English, so the dictionaries tell us. Essentially it refers to a state of being secure and free of worry. Now this is not just about protecting territory, national assets and citizens from armed subversion from within or without. It is about obtaining and protecting a decent, worry-free, healthy, wholesome lifestyle for all citizens.
Like most key words in matters of the state, security can and should be all-encompassing (like environment or economy for instance). It offers a window that opens us to all sectors: education, health, nutrition, environment, sustainability and basic freedoms even as it speaks to national boundaries and resources or the general safety of people and property.
National security is nothing if people have to second guess themselves before expressing opinions, nothing if people cannot live the lifestyles that give them meaning, nothing if laws and regulations can be bent by the powerful, nothing if institutions encourage wrongdoing and systems offer refuge to wrongdoers
There are questions that those who write manifestos and/or those who want power need to address: What is security Are we secure If we are not, how do we go about obtaining national security
If we were to take a comprehensive view of things, as we should, then we would have to conclude that insecurity is sadly a constant; well, at least into the foreseeable future. There are imponderables (e.g. the price of oil, the maverick and destructive nature of US foreign policy and military prerogatives, trade wars and a development model that pays lip service and nothing more to the health of the planet). Sri Lanka is a prisoner of agreements that contravene national interest but were signed under duress or out of ignorance or servility. We swallowed the development lie, compromised food security, sneered at technologies that were developed over centuries, placed trust on crooks, brigands, murderers, colonial slaves and such to run our affairs, and played a key part in the sustained development of impoverishment on all fronts. 
Through it all, we have collectively refused to recognize the greatest insecurity of them all: that which is resident in our minds and prevents us from recognizing resources and potentials while persuading us to allow others to imprint in our consciousness their versions of our realities. 
Security is not only about the right now and certainly not about protecting the lifestyles and positions of privilege of the few. It is not about safeguarding systems made to rob, cheat, hoodwink, insult, humiliate and impoverish people. 
A war situation understandably pushes a lot of these issues to the back-burner, but even in such situations these cannot be forgotten.
Perhaps the tragedy has been that even when war was not a problem, these matters were not considered important. 25 years go, the then US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Teresita C. Schaffer ominously stated, your (Sri Lankas) food security lies in the wheat fields of North America. Sure, if we had the bucks and if we had options should wheat prices go through the ceiling; what USAID, which was essentially writing the countrys agricultural policy at the time, advocated was to grow gherkin and baby corn instead of rice. 
Schaffer, tellingly, is described as an expert on economic, political, security, and risk management trends in South Asia and now serves as a senior adviser to McLarty Associates, a Washington-based international strategic advisory firm. 
Thats the USA doing whats in her interest. The tragedy is that weve been happy to just tag along, not just in the agriculture sector but the overall paradigm of development which is essentially a recipe for continued underdevelopment and maldevelopment. 
National security is about intelligence (yes, more than than military hardware). National security means nothing if food security is ignored or compromised. National security is nothing if theres no security against climate change. National security is a failure if the dignity and self-respect of all citizens is not assured
National security is about intelligence (yes, more than than military hardware). National security means nothing if food security is ignored or compromised. National security is nothing if theres no security against climate change.
National security is a failure if the dignity and self-respect of all citizens is not assured. National security is nothing if people have to second guess themselves before expressing opinions, nothing if people cannot live the lifestyles that give them meaning, nothing if laws and regulations can be bent by the powerful, nothing if institutions encourage wrongdoing and systems offer refuge to wrongdoers. 
National security, most importantly, is bound to be a grotesque proposition if theres no discussion and agreement on what nation really means.
Over to you, M/s. Nagananda Kodituwakku, Rohan Pallewatte, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Maithripala Sirisena and any other individual entertaining hopes of becoming the next President of Sri Lanka.

Nothing fair about new train fares Commuters shocked at ticket price hike
	
Public transportation at present in Sri Lanka has developed to a certain extent that most people tend to use them. Modes of public transport inSri Lanka comprise buses, cars, trains, tuk tuks or three wheeled taxis and helicopters. Among the mentioned modes, the train is the most commonly used travelling mode in terms of its convenience and low charges. 
SLR operates approximately 396 trains which includes 67 Long-Distance and 16 intercity trains
	SLR owns and maintains 1561km of rail tracks
	The minimum fare of Rs.10 remains unchanged
	At present, it has a workforce of 17, 634
History of Sri Lanka Railways
Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) is a Government department functioning under the Ministry of Transport and is a major transport service provider. It is the only rail transport organisation in the country. SLR transports both passenger and freight. At its inception, these trains were carrying more freight than passengers. But at present these trains are passenger oriented. 
Additional General Manager (Operations) Wijaya Samarasinghe told Daily Mirror that SLR operates approximately 396 trains which includes 67 Long-Distance and 16 intercity trains. These trains carry about 2 million passengers daily. 
SLR owns and maintains 1561km of rail tracks, 72 locomotives, power sets 78, 565 carriages and the signaling network. At present, it has a workforce of 17, 634, Samarasinghe said. 
Move to revise train fares
The Budget Proposal for 2018 put forward that the train fares be revised. Accordingly, the new train revision came into effect from October 01 (Monday). However, the train fare revision somewhat puzzled commuters and was debatable. The majority of the commuters are of the opinion that it has not been done sensibly. 
In order to elucidate the misunderstanding that prevails among commuters, Railways Deputy Commercial Superintendent N.J. Indipola said when contacted that the train fare revision of 15 per cent increase did not reflect on the current fare, but the price was based on the train fare per kilometre.
According to the Gazette notification No.7514 issued in this regard, third, second and the first classes fares are rounded to the nearest five, ten and twenty respectively.
He said that under the new revision, the minimum fare of Rs. 10 for the third class, Rs. 20 for the Second Class and Rs. 40 First Class, wouldnt change. However, the maximum distance that could be travelled by paying the minimum fare would be reduced from 9 kilometres to 7 kilometres. 
Application of revised train fares
The previous fare charged per kilometre was Rs.4.20 for the first class, Rs.2.30 for second class and Rs.1.30 for a third class. The 15 per cent increase has been calculated based on this fare for the three classes. If the fare, when calculated, for example is between Rs.10.50 and Rs.14.50 it will be rounded up to Rs.15, Indipola explained. 
He said that the fares had been rounded up to avoid giving back small change.When asked if it was unfair for the commuters, he said the same procedure was adopted even when the prices were last reviewed in 2008. If the fare includes a figure with cents, it creates issues for both commuters and railway officials, he added. When asked about the issuing of the train tickets at the previous prices, Indipola said that they would do so until the old stocks finished. 
Season tickets
Indipola said that the cost of the season tickets has been calculated based on the ordinary fare multiplied by 24. In the case of concessionary tickets of Government servants and schools students, the cost of the season tickets has been calculated based on the ordinary fare multiplied by nine and six respectively, Indipola added. 
Assuming that an ordinary train fare is Rs.20, the season ticket for the same fare will be calculated as 20x24= Rs. 480. 
Accordingly, the season tickets of Rs.420, Rs.600, Rs. 1320 and Rs.3360 will be revised as Rs.720, Rs.960, Rs. 1800 and Rs. 4320 respectively. Meanwhile, he said that the minimum fare of Rs.10 remains unchanged and added the maximum prices for the First, Second and Third classes are calculated as Rs. 1480, Rs. 860 and Rs. 475 respectively. (Jaffna to Matara train is the longest distance passenger travelling train) 
SL Railways and its inefficiencies
At present the SLR is running thanks to the income generated from ticket fares
-Chandrajothi Thera
Movement of Workers and Passengers for Protecting the Railway Service charged that the Governments move to revise the train fares was a fraud. Addressing a news briefing held yesterday, the Movements convener Ven. Adurathwila Chandrajothi Thera said it was unfair to increase the train charges without considering its inefficiencies. 
It is because of the undue intervention of the Government that the Sri Lanka Railways has become an inefficient entity. Consequently, it has become a loss making department, At present the SLR is running thanks to the income generated from ticket fares. The rest of the income earning facilities which the SLR previously enjoyed, have been taken under the purview of the Government, Ven. Chandrajothi Thera said. 
If the Government really wants to make the SLR a profit making entity, what should be done, is to provide diesel without taxes. At present, the SLR has to bear millions spent on diesel, Ven. Chandrajothi Thero added. Nevertheless the monk said that the recent Budgets had curtailed 50 percent of the funds allocated to the SLR during past two years. 
SLR has no authority to determine train charges
 -Dr. Gunaruwan
Former General Manager of Railways and Senior Lecturer at the University of Colombo, Dr. Lalithasiri Gunaruwan told Daily Mirror that the SLR had no authority to determine train charges. 
He said it is the Treasury that determined the charges of train tickets. The General Manager of Railways (GMR) of SLR does not possess the powers over the appointments, promotions, determination of train charges, salaries, taking actions over disciplinary basis etc. The only authority he has is to place his signature to letters, Dr. Gunaruwan added. 
The powers of the General Manager of Railways (GMR) have been curbed and decentralized to branches like Management Services Department, Public Service Commission, Establishment Department and Ministry of Civil Service Affairs, National Salaries and Cadre Commission and Treasury Operations Department etc., Dr. Gunaruwan. 
This situation is not good for the well-being of the Sir Lanka Railways. Hence, the Government should make sure that adequate authorities are provided to the SLR in order to render an effective service to the Railway service, Dr. Gunaruwan said. 
Train commuters complained that their train fares had been increased by more than 15 per cent despite the media reports stating that the fare would be increased by 15 per cent. Daily Mirror When spoke with some daily commuters, Niel Fernando said he was surprised at the way in which the train fare had been revised. 

We thought that the increase of the percentage (15%) has been added to the existing fare. However, thanks to the media, we got to know that it was done not in such a manner, but based on the train fare per kilometre, Fernando said.
Malkanthi Wathsala Tennakoon said she was not opposed to the decision to increase the train fare, but the Railways Department should announce the correct formula used to reverse train fares. It is a known thing that SLR is experiencing a higher expenditure as against revenue. Hence, I dont see any wrong in this, Tennakoon said.
At the same time, Joseph Appuhami who is a government servant said it was good to increase the fare, but the Government should make sure the facilities of the compartments are upgraded. We still use the trains and enjoy facilities that were adapted during the time of British. At present, the authorities have spent billions of rupees on building highways, expressways and new link roads. But has it initiated effective projects to upgrade the railway entity questioned Appuhami.

PM took all policy decisions on economy till NCE appointment: Minister
	
SLFP Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe today said it is not the National Economic Council (NEC) Chaired by the President but the Cabinet Sub Committee on Economic Management Chaired by the Prime Minister that took all policy decisions regarding economic matters and the President has continuously raised these matters over the past three years.
Minister Samarasinghe was responding to a question raised by a journalist at the SLFP news briefing on a comment that had been made by a UNP backbencher at Sirkotha to ask the NEC led by President Sirisena as to what they have done about the current economic situation.
The predictions of President Sirisena in the last three years on the economy had been proved correct and he was trying his best to correct certain mistakes through the National Economic Council (NEC), the Minister said.
Minister Samarasinghe said President Sirisena held an extremely successful discussion between the NEC and business leaders, economic experts and top public officials led by governor of the Central Bank.
They focused on how the economy progresses amid the prevailing precarious situation that has been aggravated with the sharp depreciation of rupee against dollar, rising cost of living as a result of fuel price hike, dwindling FDI, withdrawal of foreign funds invested in the bond market and remedies to arrest the trend, Minister Samarasinghe said.

President Maithripala Sirisena had to intervene when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe became annoyed with a leading businessman at the National Economic Council (NEC) meeting held on Tuesday at the Presidential Secretariat and reconvened it after the suspension of the meeting for a few minutes, SLFP dissident group front liner S.B.Dissanayaka said today.
He said Mr. Wickremesinghe had not been happy about the views expressed by DSI Group chairman Dr. Samson Rajapaksa when he said he was now importing leather products, mainly shoes from China.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has reportedly said that the government did not want advice on economics from Rajapaksas and blamed Dr. Rajapaksa which compelled President Sirisena to postpone the meeting for a few minutes, Mr. Dissanayaka said.
Addressing their weekly news briefing, Mr. Dissanayaka said the neo-liberal economic policies of the UNP prepared and operated by the threesome, Malik, Paskaralingam and Charitha did not suit todays needs of the country and the failure in the economy was brought about by them.
There is no doubt that the collapse of the national economy, uncontrolled depreciation of the rupee, continuous increase of fuel prices and related price hike of all essential commodities are the direct results of these policies, he said.
The unrestricted permission given to import anything and everything including non essential goods like kites, green gram, soy beans and various other food varieties and toys have drained billions of dollars out of the country. Almost all these imports can be easily produced in Sri Lanka. Result is the sharp depreciation of rupee and mounds of debts, Mr. Dissanayaka noted.
He pointed out that Mr. Wickremesinghe and his government did not have a strategy to restore the confidence among investors and develop tea and rubber industry, tourism and garment industry. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
