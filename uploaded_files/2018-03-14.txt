Merkel sworn in as Chancellor for fourth term
	
Angela Merkel has been sworn in for a fourth term as German chancellor, after months of political wrangling that left her weakened, the BBC reported today.
Germany's parliament earlier approved her re-election by 364 votes to 315.
Mrs Merkel has vowed to get to work quickly after the longest period of coalition-building in post-war Germany.
It is nearly six months since the election, Mrs Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Christian Social Union (CSU) bloc had its worst result in almost 70 years.
But she finally secured a coalition deal with the Social Democrats (SPD) earlier this month following a painful stretch of political deadlock.
It cost her several key posts - including finance and foreign minister - in Germany's new cabinet. After parliament confirmed Mrs Merkel's reappointment on Wednesday, she told MPs: "I accept the vote."

The President's Secretary Austin Fernando and representatives of facebook will meet at the Presidential Secretariat tomorrow, to work out a method to ensure necessary protection and surveillance, and to lift the temporary restriction on access to the facebook site, the Presidential Secretariat said.
Issuing a statement, the Presidential Secretariat said ?the President stresses the importance of a guided mechanism to prevent the attempts to disturb the livelihoods of people, through spreading ethnic-hatred and racism and damaging the image of an individual through false allegations.?
It also said;
The Government has taken steps to restrict access to social media tools temporarily during the last few days, in order to curtail the attempts to spread communal violence across the country, misusing the social media in a manner detrimental to the national harmony.
In a context where the impact that could be made by social media to expeditiously increase the violent actions based on racism and religious extremism has been internationally proven, Sri Lanka was able to control the rapid spread of violence by temporarily imposing restrictions on social media as an action to ensure the national and public safety of Sri Lanka.
President Maithripala Sirisena, who is currently on a state visit to Japan, after evaluating the security situation of the country and implementing the necessary monitoring and surveillance methods, had instructed his Secretary to permit access to Viber from yesterday night (13) lifting the temporary restriction imposed on it.
Furthermore, the President, based on further evaluation of the social media networks that are still denied access, has advised the lifting of restrictions on whatsapp service with effect from midnight of yesterday(15). (SAJ)

Sarath Weerasekara urges UNHRC to impose moratorium
	
Rear Admiral (Retd.) Sarath Weerasekera speaking before the UNHRC in Geneva today urged the Council to impose a moratorium on all actions related to the resolution against Sri Lanka pending a decision on his Complaint Procedures petition.
?Normally, the Complaint Procedures mechanism is used against States, but I have adduced cogent reasons why the mechanism must cover complaints against the UNHRC or the OHCHR,? he said.
Rear Admiral Weerasekera further said: " In March 2017, I filed two reports which conclusively rebutted the OISL report of the High Commissioner which alleged that Sri Lankan forces committed war crimes. The OISL report is the basis for resolution 30/1.
The SL Government's Foreign Minister co-sponsored the resolution without the approval of the President and the Parliament of Sri Lanka.
Continuing to implement a resolution based on a flawed report is a breach of the principles of the UN Charter, and therefore a grave violation of the human rights of all Sri Lankans. It is the people of Sri Lanka who have to ultimately suffer the consequences of ill-advised UNHRC resolutions.
The Human Rights Council is not above the law.
Having exhausted all my options in bringing this situation to the attention of the Council, I have filed a Complaint Procedures petition.
I request the Council to impose a moratorium on all actions related to resolution 30/1 pending a decision on my complaint."

SLBFE to help bring back housemaid?s remains from Saudi
	
The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) would help to bring back the remains of the Sri Lankan housemaid, who was shot dead in Saudi Arabia, the SLBFE said today.
The deceased had been identified as 38-year-old Jayasekara Priyantha from Galle.
The foreign media reported that the Lankan woman was killed by gunfire in Buraidah, Saudi Arabia on Saturday morning, where a Saudi man, who was accused of shooting her, later committed suicide by shooting himself.
SLBFE Internal Affairs Additional General Manager W. M. V. Wansekara told the Daily Mirror that the deceased, who was reported to be a mother of two children, was a resident of Katamurawa in Galle.
?The 38-year-old deceased has left for Saudi Arabia in April 2017, by registering at SLBFE through an SLBFE-approved institute,? he said.
He said the Sri Lankan Embassy in Saudi Arabia had referred a brief report to them on the incident last morning and added that it was too early to provide more details on it since investigations were still being conducted by the security authorities over there.
He also said the SLBFE had contacted the deceased's family following this unfortunate incident.
?The remains, which are currently at an area hospital, will be released by the Saudi Arabian Police after the investigations. The SLBFE will assist in bringing back the remains to Sri Lanka. However, the Consular Affairs Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will initiate steps to bring back the remains,? he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The JO members led by the former strongman had recently met behind locked doors to work out the nitty-gritties of the much publicized no confidence motion.?

The former strongman had pointed out that motion would carry much weight and a telling effect if they could collect the signatures of a section of Green members in addition to the Blue party sympathizers.?
A Pohottuwa leader said that they were in a position to get some Blue sympathizers to sign the motion.? ?What about the Green ones raising a big racket against their leader?? the former strongman queried.? ? ? ?

? There are several Greens shouting a lot. But none of them is coming forward to sign the motion!? another Pohottuwa member replied.? ?There is at least one Green member who will certainly put his signature,? Pohottuwa boss assured.
?Who is he?? they all asked in unison.?
One of them made a guess ? a young Green member known by a three-letter first name ? a direct descendent of a onetime leading political family in the country. And their boss confirmed it.?
They all had recalled that this dissident Green member announced in public his elation over the debacle of yahapalanaya at the recent mini-polls.

After having returned from the boutique the woman had kept the bag inside her house and went to her daughter's house nearby. When she returned she was surprised to find that the bag had been torn and ransacked and the items were strewn all over the house.
Incensed by the sight which she thought might be the handiwork of a thief she had rushed out of the house in search of the thief.

Trump fires Tillerson
	
?
US President Donald Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Tuesday and replaced him with CIA director Mike Pompeo, ending an acrimonious 13-month relationship.
In an impromptu press conference on the White House lawn, Trump told reporters there was a ?chemistry? problem between him and Tillerson.
?It was different mindset. It was a different thinking,? Trump said, adding: ?I think Rex will be much happier now.?
A senior White House official said Trump wanted to orchestrate a change to his national security team ahead of planned high-stakes talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Tillerson, a Texan and the chief executive of energy company ExxonMobil for a decade before joining the administration, has long been dogged by reports that his time in office will be cut short.
Trump frequently cast Tillerson as weak and clueless. Their long-simmering tensions erupted into the public in October, after Tillerson suggested the US could engage in talks with North Korea.
?I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man ... ?Save your energy Rex, we?ll do what has to be done!? Trump tweeted on October 1.
Days later NBC News reported that Tillerson had called the president a ?moron? after a July meeting at the Pentagon with members of Trump?s national security team and Cabinet officials. Tillerson never denied using the description, but said he would not be part of any effort to divide the administration.
Trump then challenged his top diplomat ?to compare IQ tests? in a interview with Forbes magazine.
The 65-year-old Tillerson was at odds with a number of Trump?s policies. For example, he favoured the US remaining in the Paris climate accord and has been less harsh towards Iran on questions relating to a deal to keep it from attaining nuclear weapons.

UK expels 23 Russian diplomats
	
British Prime Minister Theresa May expelled 23 Russian diplomats today, blaming Moscow for the poisoning of a former Russian spy and sharply escalating the dispute between the two countries, the New York Times reported today.
Her statement to Parliament came after Moscow rejected a British deadline for Russia to explain itself over this month?s nerve-agent attack on the former spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter.
The two countries have engaged in an worsening clash in recent days, with Britain widening an investigation into the incident and courting friends and allies to increase pressure on Russia, while Moscow has threatened to retaliate over any punitive action.
?This represents an unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom,? Mrs. May said in an address to the House of Commons. ?It must therefore be met with a full and robust response.?
She said she had agreed with Britain?s National Security Council to suspend all high-level contacts between her country and Russia, and to expel 23 Russian diplomats, who were given one week to leave. She described it as the biggest expulsion in more than 30 years.
The prime minister also said the government had agreed on new powers to crack down on the activities of foreign intelligence agents in Britain, that there was no place for ?serious criminals and corrupt elites? in the country, and that an invitation for Foreign Minister Sergei V. Lavrov of Russia to visit had been withdrawn.

The University Trade Union Joint Committee (UTUJC) today said that the work stoppage by the non-academic staff of state universities would continue in the absence of a positive response from the authorities regarding their demands.
As a result 15 State universities and other institutions under the University Grants Commission (UGC) are at a standstill for the fifteenth day as at yesterday.
UTUJC Chairman Edward Malwattage said they had launched this work stoppage over six demands relating to their employment, which they had proposed one and half year ago, including a salary hike.
?Although the work stoppage which began on February 28, was continuing for the fifteenth day the entire higher education system is facing a serious problem. The authorities have failed to provide us with a solution,? he said.
Mr. Malwattage said they had decided not to engage in any maintenance or repairs of emergency breakdowns of water and electricity supplies at the universities from yesterday.
He said discussions were continuing with student unions attached to the State universities with a view to supporting the work stoppage carried out by the non-academic staff. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Taken aback by this unexpected request the former strongman had replied: ?Why do you want me to issue statements to the public?? That?s the responsibility of your own bosses!?

## Title: Why is ?Kandy? associated with the mayhem?

Why is ?Kandy? associated with the mayhem?
	
Citizens in Kandy should show their displeasure over what politicians and others have done to create violence in places like Digana, Teldeniya and other areas.? ?
Citizens in Kandy had enough after the ?one hundred days of terror? during the 1915 riots
	The incidents were created by a handful of disgruntled persons outside Kandy
	This false picture given would sent the word around that Kandy is not safe for tourists
Friends around the globe, whom I know, were telephoning me. ?L.B. are you safe in Kandy? they asked me. I said ?Yes?. But, it did not strike me during those moments. There was a reason behind these inquiries. Later it dawned on me that these attacks in Digana and Teldeniya are termed as ?Kandy violence? by the Kandy folk.? ?
But, none of these incidents occurred in Kandy. The incidents were created by a handful of disgruntled persons outside Kandy. After the first day of incidents the newspapers reported that there was mayhem in Digana and Teldeniya. But, all these incidents were associated with one word: Kandy. Soon people were assuming that people from Kandy were involved in these incidents.? ?
This false picture given would sent the word around that Kandy is not safe for tourists. Kandy is the centre of Buddhist activities, given that Gautama Buddha?s tooth relic is housed at the Maligawa (Temple of the Tooth). Kandy is the place which attracts tourists, not Digana and Teldeniya. However these two towns come under the purview of Kandy District. My concerns are why the name Kandy was mentioned when no clash too place here.? ?
Then why blame Kandy citizens who had no hand in these incidents in Teldeniya, Digana and in surrounding areas? This situation has to be corrected, at least now
Citizens in Kandy had enough after the ?one hundred days of terror? during the 1915 riots. Given this history no one would dare to get involved in any such incident which would create a communal rift. Another incident that the Kandy people would not forget is the ?Walhagoda Devale? incident. During this incident both the Sinhala and Muslim communities had to settle their grievances in a massive Court case.? ?
In this background the people of Kandy would never allow history to repeat. The citizens of Kandy had remained silent during this commotion and allowed everyone to blame them for the violence in which they played no role. Geographically Kandy is surrounded by The Mahaweli and there have been no ethnic hatred. It?s a big question as to why others think that Kandy citizens are to blame for all this violence?? ?
Time and again when these incidents are highlighted and also when the Police Media Spokesman talks about the violence he mentions Kandy as the source where the mayhem begins from. The affected are clearly demarcated by rivers and bridges and it is superfluous that Kandy has come to the picture without even a stone thrown at a Muslim in this part of the Central Province. The Kandy people have lived in peace after 1915 and there is no doubt they would continue to do so for centuries.? ?
When the death occurred of driver M.G Kumarasinghe, in Teldeniya, the point of the so-called mayhem, initially no one knew to what communities the assailants and victim belonged to. It was days later that they found that the culprits were members of the Muslim community. The Muslims denounced them as members of their community when it was alleged the assailants were under the influence of liquor.? ?
The affected are clearly demarcated by rivers and bridges and it is superfluous that Kandy has come to the picture without even a stone thrown at a Muslim in this part of the Central Province
Then why blame Kandy citizens who had no hand in these incidents in Teldeniya, Digana and in surrounding areas? This situation has to be corrected, at least now. Politicians can do better than repeatedly ?chanting? the name Kandy!
Folks of Kandy should be respected for finding a way to live in harmony with people belonging to different races and religions.? ?

A tale of anguish and travel written in Matale Somu Style
	
The book ?Kandy Seemai? will be launched on March 18 at Colombo Thamil Sangam??
A novel authored by Matale Somu, a prolific writer who is now living in Australia, will be launched on 18th March at the Colombo Thamil Sangam, Wellawatte under the chairmanship of Prof.Sandarasegaram, advisor to the Minister of National Coexistence, Dialogue and Official Languages, Mano Ganeshan.??
Matale Somu has written 25 books in Tamil, among which are several novels, short stories, literary pieces and travelogues. His book on ?the wonders of Tamil indigenous medicine? was his masterpiece, acclaimed by many scholars interested in this discipline. Although he lives in Australia, he still remembers his motherland, language and his people. And that is the reason why he is appreciated by the Tamil literary circles nationally and abroad. He is also acclaimed for his writings on themes pertaining to the living conditions of his people. This book under the title ?KANDY SEEMAI? depicts the sufferings and anguish of these people during their departure from India to Sri Lanka during the 1820s.
Although Matale Somu lives in Australia, he still remembers his motherland, language and his people
The title is of some significance. During the 19th Century the upcountry was known as Kandy and the word SEEMAI literally refers to England, but idiomatically it refers to resourceful. Hence the meaning is resourceful Kandy or upcountry where there were opportunities for employment and well-being.

Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Act--Govt. officials not taking it seriously: BC
	
The Bribery Commission has felt the urgent need to amend the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Act as many government officials and their departments ?do not take it very seriously? to facilitate such mandatory personal data annually, a source said.
A top official of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption said except for a very few state departments like the three armed forces and the police, the rest do not maintain their registers of personal assets of its staff members.
Under the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Act, all government employees in Staff Grade and above, as well as all government politicians, should declare their assets and liabilities annually to the heads of their departments or their superiors.
State officials are required to fill the form, 'Declaration of Assets and Liabilities', with actual details of their present movable and immovable assets, bank accounts and funds of every year and hand it over to their respective department head, prior to March of the following year.
Although this was the usual practice, a recent survey carried out by the Commission had disclosed that many government institutions were not adhering to this and not maintaining their registries of staff asset details, as per the legal requirement.
This came to light when the Commission initiated a spree of legal action against such errant department heads since 2016. Although the act was pretty much active previously, the Commission (which has the sole authority to check on that) did not frequently file lawsuits against such errant officials, before.
The official said another main reason that caused to amend the act was the poor amount of fines being imposed on the errant officials. The maximum fine for a state official who fails to declare his assets and liabilities is only Rs.1, 000 and it is not surprising how they take this for granted.
Compared to the developed countries, this fine is considered significantly low and the laws should be amended to increase the fine at least up to Rs.100, 000, he said.
In a bid to address this issue, the Bribery Commission has taken the preliminary steps to amend the act, where a special discussion was held yesterday in Colombo with the participation of a number of key government institutions as Attorney General?s Department, Legal Draftsman, Elections Commission, Auditor General?s Department, Police Department as well as foreign bodies like United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
A good response had been received from all the participants at the meeting and the Bribery Commission is to sit down for further talks with the Legal Draftsman in the coming days, on the new proposals for the amendment of the act.
The Bribery Commission and the Auditor General's Department usually require the details of personal assets of state officials and politicians for its respective probes, if a complaint arose with regard to unlawful acquisition of assets by government officials or politicians.
In such instances, the probing body will demand the relevant assets details of that particular individual from his respective state department head.
The official further said, the three forces and the police maintain their staff assets registries intact and on time may be due to the strict discipline they require in those services.
Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Act No. 1 of 1975 empowers the probing bodies to conduct such inquiries. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Deportation of SL family in Australia reprieved
	
A Sri Lankan asylum seeker family in Australia had been pulled from a plane overnight just minutes before they were due to be deported, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on Wednesday.
The border force officials had removed Nadesalingam, Priya and their two Australian-born daughters from Biloela last week and put them in a Melbourne detention centre.
Tamil Refugee Council spokesman Ben Hillier said they were handcuffed and taken in separate vans to Melbourne Airport on Tuesday, flown to Perth and placed on a flight to Sri Lanka.
However, a last-minute legal intervention had resulted in them being removed from the plane before it took off.
It was reported that the couple had come to Australia separately by boat in 2012 and 2013, following Sri Lanka's civil war.
They have settled in Biloela on a bridging visa, which has since expired.
Mr. Hillier said the family feared Nadesalingam would be persecuted if he returned to Sri Lanka because of his history with the LTTE.
The removal of the family from the small Queensland town had shocked the community and that they have decided to take action to bring them back.
A Department of Home Affairs spokesman said the family's case has been assessed over many years.
"They have consistently been found not to meet Australia's protection obligations," he said.

Depression moving towards Arabian Sea: Met. Dept.
	
As the depression to the South-west of Sri Lanka is now located around 550km away from Colombo and likely to move towards the Arabian Sea, its effect to the country will gradually decrease, the Meteorology Department said this morning.
The Department said that several spells of showers would occur in the Northern, Eastern, North-central, Uva and Southern provinces while showers or thundershowers may occur elsewhere after 2.00pm.
According to the Weather Report issued at 5.30 am, the Department said that fairly heavy rain falls of about 75mm are expected in some areas, particularly in the Vauniya, Mannar, Puttalam and Kurunegala district.
Fairly strong gusty winds of up to 50 kmph could be expected particularly over the North-Central province and the Galle district.
Meanwhile, the Natural Hazards Early Warning Centre of the Meteorology Department said that there is a possibility for heavy showers or thundershowers and rough seas due to the sudden increase of wind speeds of up to 70-80 kmph in the deep sea areas off the coast extending from Puttalam to Matara via Colombo and Galle.
The depression is likely to intensify further and move away from the island towards the Arabian Sea. Therefore the navel and fishing communities are further requested to be vigilant in this regard. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Govt. to set up new institution to monitor social media: Harin
	
The government is discussing setting up an institution to monitor social media usage, Minister of Digital Infrastructure Technology Harin Fernando said yesterday.
He said this measure would be aimed at preventing posts which provoke hate against any community or religion.
?The government will not block social media such as Facebook but there will be strict monitoring, which will be aimed at preventing postings which provoke hate among communities and religions. This monitoring may result in barding those who upload hate speech on social media,? the Minister said.
The institute would also monitor those posting and watching child pornography and other pornography.
? I am not for censoring but unwanted postings which provoke ethnic and religious hatred should be avoided as it could bring disaster to the country. ?We have been witnessing postings which provoke people and even video clips which were false. Some have even uploaded false video saying such and such an establishment was attacked. Both Sinhalese and Muslims were engaged in such provocations over social media during the past few days,? the Minister said.
He added that the government had wanted Facebook to remove pages of those who provoke hatred sometime back before the trouble in Kandy. However, he said it was not possible as Facebook did not have sufficient human resources to do so. ?Facebook actually did not have those who could be conversant in Sinhalese to identify and remove the Sinhala content which promoted hatred. Status of Sinhalese in the globe had played a role in this shortcoming as it is not a language which is spoken universally,? he said in this regard.
Mr. Fernando who defended the restriction of Facebook said one must remember that several countries such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Iran and Syria have blocked Facebook from time to time. ?The country would have experienced the worst disaster than July 1983 racial riots if the government did not block social media. There was no other alternative to hate speech over social media became uncontrollable,? he said. However, the Minister revealed that around 800,000 people have managed to log into Facebook through virtual private networks despite measures taken to block it. (Yohan Perera)

If something is harmful we have to contain it - President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena while speaking on the current restrictions on the social media that have been imposed after the violence mainly in Ampara and Kandy Districts said yesterday that if something is detrimental to the society we will have to contain its effects despite it being useful in some other way.
Addressing a gathering of Sri Lankans in Japan the President, however, said that the restrictions on the social media would be lifted soon.
He lamented that many people in Sri Lanka use the social media to destroy the country in spite of the mobile phone, computer, internet, and the social media having been invented to uplift human society.
"Before the violence in Ampara and Kandy Districts, people complained that Facebook had been a social evil that destroys the family life and incites hatred among various communities. They wanted us to control these media but we did not agree with them. Yet, we were compelled to place certain restrictions temporarily on them when the violence started in these two districts. If we had not taken such a step the situation would have been aggravated," President Sirisena said.
He said that the ban on the social media brought in both good and bad effects. "Some companies have incurred losses while some others like Telecom have benefited and precious time wasted on the social media has been saved," he added. (Kanchan Dasanayake)

'Infertility pill': No documented instances of its use, worldwide
	
While rejecting the myths regarding the so called "infertility pill", a group of medical professionals today said there were no easily available drugs in western medical practice, which can significantly affect fertility, if they were administered once or for a short period, to an individual.
Consultant Physician Dr. Upul Dissanayake in a statement said there had been no documented instances of the use of such drugs aimed at reducing fertility in the population, anywhere in the world.
He said the fertility in males and females was influenced by many factors where medicinal drugs were only one factor which can potentially affect fertility.
?Male fertility depends upon the presence of adequate numbers of active spermatozoa. When either the number of spermatozoa are reduced, or their function and mobility are impaired, the ability to impregnate a woman is reduced and this results in sub-fertility and in extreme situations, infertility. Similar factors may affect the fertility of a woman,? he said.
He said the pharmaceutical industry has been searching for a medicinal drug which can cause temporary infertility so that it can be used as a male contraceptive agent, however such a medicine has not been developed as yet.
He said some medicines used for other purposes may reduce the sperm count in men, or affect fertility in women as a side effect of their use.
?Such a reduction in fertility by these drugs can be reversed in most instances. All such drugs can only be obtained with a valid prescription from a registered doctor. Furthermore, a single dose or a few doses of these medications are not adequate to cause significant changes in sperm counts or sperm function,? he said.

JVP urge govt. to restore social media without delay
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today urged the government to immediately restore social media networks without suppressing the media and causing a serious violation of the peoples? democratic rights.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath said people who use social media for general communication and professional activities were hugely inconvenienced because the government had not taken any steps to lift the ban imposed on social media in the wake of the tense situation in Kandy.
He said in a letter to the media minister that they were doubtful whether the government was attempting to restrict peoples? democratic rights such as the freedom of speech and the Right to Information by extending the ban on social media networks.
He said the government should have taken precautions not to allow people to resort to hate speech and statements inciting racism at the beginning and impose laws against those violating the law, before the situation got worse, alleging that the government did not act promptly when such incidents were increasing.
Mr. Herath further stated that the government was now engaged in a move similar to conducting the postmortem of the recent violent incidents.
He said the social media should not be barred due to the activities of a few people as it has become a necessity. (Ajith Siriwardana)
