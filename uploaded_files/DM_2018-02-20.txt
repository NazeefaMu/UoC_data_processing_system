Ceylinco General Insurance records Rs.18bn premium income in 2017
	
Ceylinco General Insurance Ltd., announced results for the financial year ended 31st December 2017 recently.
Ajith Gunawardena, Chief Executive Officer of Ceylinco General Insurance, announcing the results said: During 2017, the company recorded a premium income of Rs. 18 billion (Rs. 17,977 million), with an impressive growth of 11.5 percent, which signifies an increase of Rs. 1.9 billion over the previous year.
When considering the stiff competition that exists in the market, last years performance was outstanding. Despite the price undercutting practiced by some players, customers have understood the value of Ceylinco VIP On The Spot.
We believe in providing a superior service to our customers and our differentiation is not on price but on our exemplary claim settlement and the value we add to our products and services. We have worked hard together and surpassed expectations and our own benchmarks.
We remain committed in exercising disciplined control and maintaining far-sighted leadership. As always, this performance is entirely due to the firm belief the Sri Lankan public has placed in us, and the efforts of each and every member of the Ceylinco General Insurance family. Our humble thanks and heartfelt gratitude are extended to all those who made such a feat possible.
Elaborating further on the remarkable figures, Patrick Alwis, Managing Director of Ceylinco General Insurance Ltd, said: Ceylinco General Insurance paid claims amounting to Rs. 9 billion (Rs. 8,967 million) during 2017, settling all genuine claims within 24 hours. This includes the large number of flood and cyclone claims that were paid within a period of 14 days, enabling customers to return to normalcy in the fastest possible time. We are the only company to do so.
Alwis further said, I pay a special tribute to the staff of Ceylinco General Insurance who acted promptly to pay compensation to all of its policy holders with flood and cyclone cover who were affected by the floods and the inclement weather that created havoc in 2017. We assure the insuring public of our continued efforts to bring better and faster solutions to benefit them even further.
In a landmark move, in August 2017, Ceylinco General Insurance announced yet another innovation in Motor Insurance - a Rs. 1 million cover that reimburses medical costs incurred in the treatment of heart disease, cancer, kidney failure, stroke and several other serious illnesses including heart attack and open heart surgery, major organ transplants, chronic lung and liver diseases, deafness, blindness, multiple sclerosis, paralysis etc. Introduced as an exclusive benefit for Ceylinco VIP On The Spot policy holders, this benefit will undoubtedly ease the financial burden to a great extent in the event of an illness

## Title: DFCC Bank Records An Impressive Performance In 2017

DFCC Bank Records An Impressive Performance In 2017
	
Mr. Royle Jansz  Chairman DFCC Bank, Mr. Lakshman Silva  CEO DFCC Bank
DFCC Bank continued to demonstrate positive momentum across businesses in 2017 as a rapidly growing commercial bank completing its second year after the amalgamation.
Despite a backdrop of higher taxes, volatile interest rates, tight margins and intensifying competition, the Bank closed the financial year ended 31st December 2017 with a profit before tax of LKR 5,792 million a growth of 31% and profit after tax of LKR 4,415 million a growth of 34% over the year ended 31st December 2016.
The Banks net interest income rose by 27%, to LKR 11,343 million improving the net interest margin from 3.3% in 2016 to 3.6% in 2017. In addition, the Banks net fee and commission income grew by 22% to LKR 1,591 million, while it recorded a growth in most of its income segments with a 25% increase in total operating income year-on-year.
The successful blending of development and commercial banking has resulted in an unique commercial banking institution with a distinct development banking bias as a consequence of DFCC being the oldest development bank in Asia and a pioneer in the countrys development projects.
DFCC has been recognised by S&P and the international rating outlook has been revised to stable from negative while maintaining our ratings at B/B. This was closely followed by Fitch who also upgraded DFCCs international and long term outlook from negative to stable while maintaining the international & domestic ratings at B+ and AA- respectively. During a year within which the bank had to face many challenges, this is a very significant achievement.
It was a year in which DFCC excelled due to the mix of complementary strategies that were employed. The upward trend in key numbers are especially noteworthy.
The Banks financial position saw the total assets of the Bank grow by LKR 43,047 million (15%) during year 2017 mainly from LKR 27,891 million growth in loans and receivables. Total loans and receivables was LKR 213,676 million compared to LKR 185,785 million as at 31st December 2016.
The Banks deposit base reported a substantial increase of 38% from LKR 140,514 million in 2016 to LKR 193,308 million in December 2017. The Banks low cost deposits (CASA) ratio increased to 21.3% from 20.2% in 2016. This was aided by a successful drive to increase the current and savings base in the retail banking space with a range of innovative products and services, an aggressive sales force and an expansion of delivery channels which contributed to enhanced business volumes.
During the year, the Bank relocated many branches to more customer friendly locations with enhanced facilities. The Banks CASA deposits increased by LKR 9.4 Bn during the 4th quarter whilst the Bank continued to enjoy long term concessionary credit lines which improved the ratio from 21.3% to 30.1% as at December 2017.
The Net loss from financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss from other operating income increased mainly due to the marked to market impact and volume increase in foreign currency swaps year-on-year, which is managed through the higher interest income from increased lending of advances funded through swaps.
The Banks impairment charge has increased by LKR 239 million (26%) over the previous year mainly due to the growth in loan portfolio. The Banks non-performing advances (NPA) ratio as at 31st December 2017 improved to 2.77% compared to 2.97% in December 2016. Due to the prudent recovery processes implemented and close monitoring, the Bank has been able to contain the build-up of non performing advances.
The incremental cost that had to be incurred for above business growth contributed to a 15% increase in operating expenses which were a result of the amalgamation synergies required for investments in people, IT and branch expansion. Careful monitoring and effective cost control measures adopted along with additional revenues generated during the year helped the Bank to record a lower cost to income ratio of 41.1% in 2017 compared to 44.7% in the previous year.
The Banks return on assets (ROA) before tax improved to 1.9% by December 2017 from 1.6% in December 2016, while the return on equity (ROE) increased by 27% to 9.4%, from 7.4% in December 2016 and the net asset value per share for the bank is LKR 180.60 up from LKR 172.95 in 2016. The Bank has comfortably met minimum capital requirement ratios under Basel III which came in to effect from 01st July 2017. As at 31st December 2017, the Groups Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio stood at 13.09% while the total capital adequacy ratio stood at 16.53%. DFCC Bank recorded Tier 1 and total capital adequacy ratios of 12.68% and 16.13% respectively. The ratios are well above the minimum regulatory requirements of 7.25% and 11.25%. Despite an additional head count and an increase in overhead expenses, net profit per employee rose by 25% over the previous year.
Chairman Mr. Royle Jansz said, The fundamentals have been put in place for stable, sustainable growth and the bank has set itself a challenging target over the next three years. Good corporate governance is a cornerstone of the banks policy and governance has been strengthened. The bank recognises that our people are our greatest asset, and during the year under review, many initiatives to increase the skills and competence of the staff have been put in place, while ensuring they are well compensated, excellence rewarded, and talent recognised.
Commenting on the Banks performance Mr. Lakshman Silva  CEO, DFCC Bank stated, DFCCs future outlook is positive as the Banks growth drivers are delivering results. The Banks key focus areas are enhancing operational efficiencies, strategic investments, notably in technology, IT systems and solutions and increasing our penetration into markets across the country. A mix of complementary strategies will be employed to reach the set objectives and the Bank will explore a range of opportunities in consolidation and offshore marketing leveraging on its Group relationships.

Forgotten flicks: Sagara Jalaya A follow-up to the retelling
	
It must be seen today, by the young of today, Ranjith Rubasinghe told me over lunch. He was talking about Sagara Jalaya, Sumitra Periess fifth film, which I think is one of the three or four most perfectly constructed films ever made here, and which I believe is Sumitras masterpiece. Those who watch it today are often overwhelmed by the intermingling of opposites in it  of beauty and pathos, of love and hate, of reconciliation and vengefulness  which explains that sense of unpredictability which never lets go until the last scene. That it could be made with so much precision, back when movies had deteriorated in quality and worse, become debased, tells a lot about the cast and crew. I saw it twice: once when I was 10, again when I was 24. That gap, of almost 15 years, can open you up to facets of the plot you had never discerned before; the beauty of Sagara Jalaya is that even when you ignore those facets, it still seems to have been made for its time, for all time, and for everyone. 
Simon Nawagaththegama, who wrote Ohu Mala Giya Pasu, in my opinion the best story from his collection Sagara Jalaya Madi Handuva Oba Sanda (from which the scriptwriter of the film, Lester James Peries, took the title), never reveals his characters, or their flaws, in gushes and torrents. Even in a middle period work as Suddilage Kathawa, published seven years after Sagara Jalaya, theres never that kind of in-your-face apparentness that you sense in, say, Martin Wickramasinghes Koggala Trilogy. Part of the reason for that was that Nawagaththegama, who was of a different literary temperament, sought to transcend the limits of realism that the 20th century had imposed on the Sinhalese novel. But when set against this parameter, Ohu Mala Giya Pasu is an intensely poignant tale, with a kind of clarity of vision that only barely comes out in his other work, even the other stories in Sagara Jalaya. 
Nawagaththegamas work
As with much of his oeuvre, Ohu Mala Giya Pasu takes place in the dry zone of the Wanni region, near Medawachchiya, where people pray and also swear by Aiyanayaka Deviyo and where the harsh sun becomes a reality you have to get used to. In Nawagaththegamas work the smallest tension, the tiniest ripple on the surface, will charge an otherwise unimportant scene with unbearable tension, and his characters will go on and on, spitting out frenzy, hate, inexplicable madness. Never for one moment are those characters gentle, not because they lack empathy, but because that is what their world has compelled them to become. Whoever said that writers operate on universals, and that critics operate on those universals when assessing the work of those writers, was stating only half the story; the truth is that some of the greatest writers went for the milieus they grew up in. Nawagaththegama, in this sense, did through the Wanni area he had known, since childhood, what Martin Wickramasinghe had done through Koggala: depict life as it was lived. 
In the original story, which Lester and Sumitra read in translation by Ranjini Obeyesekere, the sexual tensions the adaptation only subtly unearths are there, for all to see, while the child figure, Bindu, doesnt occupy our attention the way he does onscreen. Its a cruel world that these characters inhabit, but not as cruel and pathos-ridden as that of Suddilage Kathawa, which many consider to have been a spiritual successor of sorts to Ohu Mala Giya Pasu (those familiar with both would notice the similarities: the woman, left without a husband and without an income, preying on the sexual proclivities of a man she can never have), because of the scriptwriters affirmation of humanism. You dont come across the uncontrollable savagery which Dharmasiri Bandaranayakes adaptation of Suddilage Kathawa oozes out. 
In that sense Sumitras film is easier to wade through, no matter how young or old you are; as a 10-year-old, I would not have noticed the relationship between the mudalali (Ravindra Randeniya) and Heen Kella, but that did not take my interest away because I was focusing on the relationship between Heen Kella and Bindu, her son. 15 years later, when our comprehension of marriage matured, cynically, we discerned at once the source of the hatred between Heen Kella and the mudalalis wife, her cousin, so much so that we cant pass over it. Thats why I think, it its own way, that it was a film made for all time, and for everyone: not everything in it would have appealed to those who saw it, but the emotional texture, the humanism in it that is never repudiated, is what makes it a movie-for-all-to-see at the end of the day. 
Sumitras career
But while many people have seen, and appreciated, Suddilage Kathawa, very few people have seen, much less appreciated, Sagara Jalaya. If you peruse Sumitras career this can be said of pretty much her other films: they all were received warmly by critics, and to a considerable extent by popular audiences too, but the momentum that they rode on when they were first released fizzed out, owing to certain unfortunate reasons outside the control of the director. 
Disciplined editor
Because those who have seen and waxed eloquent over Suddilage Kathawa (and those other films which had Swarna as the central tormented figure: Hansa Vilak, Dadayama, Kadapathaka Chaya) have never seen Sagara Jalaya, the latter remains inexorably fresh every time its telecast on television, which I think is part of its charm. Sumitra was primarily an editor, and a disciplined editor at that, and that comes through Sagara Jalaya almost spotlessly; music and movement are intertwined so effortlessly that I sometimes wonder how the crew and cast managed to parse the production together (We had to delay shooting by a whole year when the rains came, she told me when we talked about the film one day) until the very end. Its beautifully sustained, and owing to that, the turbulence and the oscillations of behaviour which come out, however uncontained they can get, never really rupture the gentleness and innocence at the heart of the story. 
And in the end, it is those two children who salvage the story from the ambiguities of the plot (with respect to the relationship between Heen Kella and the mudalali). Neither the girl nor the boy had been exposed to the cinema back then; that was a different time, when children were not transformed into superstars. They lose their childhoods early on, Sumitra told me, talking about the tendency of the popular culture to overhype the young when they become popular in that culture. What gets lost in this transformation is that rare ability to be yourself: the children are forced by the scriptwriter to be younger and louder than they are. They cant express themselves without resorting to the loudspeaker. A girl once told me (in jest, of course) that I behave like a 50-year-old who speaks like a 20-year-old who thinks hes a 30-year-old; roughly the same anachronism exists with respect to our onscreen children: they act below their years, but in reality project the fantasies and idealisations of them that directors and writers throw up. 
The greatness of Sagara Jalaya, or Maya, is that the child actors in them never followed up on their performances and carved out careers of their own: the tendency of our film industry to throw up wannabe Shirley Temples is recent, because children always returned to their normal lives, back then, when the production wrapped up. They were never idiotic: they thought beyond their years even though they never showed it. That was true and very much so of the two actors in Sagara Jalaya, Rasika Kumari Wickramasingha (Midiya) and Susith Chaminda de Silva (Bindu). (Where are they today) Bindus voiceover at the end, for instance, is insanely poignant, because Susith brings together the opposites at the heart of the story: pathos and beauty, innocence and ferocity. Most child actors Ive seen bring about that poignancy without uttering too many words (think of Vasanthi Chathurani at the end of Gehenu Lamayi); Susith does it by spelling out an entire letter to the audience. 
Which is why I think what Ranjith Rubasinghe told me still holds valid, after all these years. Sumitras film should be seen today, by the young of today, not only because I think its a family picture (and a good one at that), but also because it takes us back to a time when honesty and sincerity mattered; when the need to entertain, while certainly not the be-all and end-all of a film, was acknowledged and not forcibly repressed in the name of art. Those who believe in life and the affirmation of life in the movies should thus get out of their theories, their academised notions of art, and watch Sagara Jalaya.

Although the yahapalana government is attempting to obtain an Interpol Red Warrant on him it had withdrawn some 150 some such warrants including those issued on former LTTE terrorists because of the influence by Tamil politicians, former envoy Udayanga Weeratunga said today.
He said in a statement that he was informed by several media reports that Red Warrants issued on terrorists, drug traffickers and other criminals had been withdrawn based on requests made by the Sri Lanka Police.
However, he said the government had asked Interpol to issue a Red warrant on him who did not have previous offenses other than for failing to appear in Court to record a statement and that Interpol had issued a Blue Warrant on him following the second request made by the Sri Lankan Government,
Mr. Udayanga said he was arrested at the Dubai Air Port on February 4 based on false information provided by the government to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) however he was later released after confirming it was only a blue warrant that had been issued. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Humanity seeks peace and prosperity. Everybody wishes to be successful and happy in their endeavour. The question is are they able to achieve this despite their efforts. A careful observation of the world reveals that most of them enjoy either success or peace, not both. Those who are peaceful are not very productive and prosperous. Those who are prosperous are relatively not peaceful. A man living in a village leads a peaceful life. But he is not so dynamic hence not prosperous. A businessman in the city is dynamic and successful at the same time gets stressed out, so not as peaceful as the villager. Why is this paradox in life Can this be solved Bhagavad Gita the ancient scripture gives the solution. The understanding and practise of the teachings of the Gita help one to enjoy the rare combination of peace and prosperity. 
The Bhagavad Gita enunciates Vedanta philosophy. Vedanta presents the eternal and universal principles of life and living. It gives out the technique to develop dynamism in action, purity in emotion and clarity in thinking. Above all, it ushers one to the ultimate perfection of Self-realisation. 
The Bhagavad Gita is a conversation between Lord Krishna, a spiritually Enlightened soul, a person of great wisdom and his friend Arjuna in the battle field of Kurushektra. Arjuna was a great warrior, a commander in chief, an active and dynamic person in the modern context.In spite of his mastery in the art of warfare he was incapacitated to fight a crucial battle where his opponents happened to be his friends, relatives and teachers. He became emotionally overwhelmed, the great warrior got confused and confounded.Even physically collapsed in the battle field.To his favour he surrendered to Lord Krishna and sought his help. It was then that Krishna delivered the great sermon of the Bhagavad Gita. The knowledge of the Gita resurrected the fallen Arjuna. Having understood his role and purpose in the situation he fought the battle and emerged victorious, achieved peace and success. 

In the present world also most of the people are in the state of Arjuna. They may be skilful in business and successful in their career but when they are faced with a crisis they collapse
In the present world also most of the people are in the state of Arjuna. They may be skilful in business and successful in their career but when they are faced with a crisis they collapse.When the mind gets agitated one cannot think properly.This makes the person incapacitated to function.A powerful intellect alone can keep the mind calm and face the challenges of the world.One can develop the intellect through a systematic study of Vedanta.This involves a method of questioning everything and applying ones reason consistently. 
The eighteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita starts with a question. Wherein Arjuna asks Krishna the difference between sannyasa renunciation and tyaga relinquishment. Krishna defines Sannyasa as renunciation of egocentric desires by dedicating action to the supreme goal of Self-realisation. Tyaga as relinquishment of fruit of action.Tyaga is the cause. Sannyasa is the effect. Desire propels action. As long as one has desires one cannot drop actions. He can only practise dropping the anxiety to enjoy the fruit of action. Arjuna is a man of action with many desires, what is suitable for him is tyaga and not sannyasa. The same is applicable for a common man who is full of ambitions and aspirations. 
Again the natural tendency of the mind is to slip into the past and future. It always worries about the past and get anxious about the future. Never stays in the present. This saps ones energy. When the mind is not in the present the action is impaired. There is no success, no peace. One needs a powerful intellect to hold the mind in the present. Thus dropping the worry and anxiety for fruit brings about peace of mind as well as success in action. 
To enjoy peace and prosperity one has to perform yajna sacrifice, dana giving and tapa austerity as well. Yajna is fixing a higher ideal and working towards it unselfishly without ego and ego centric desires. Dana is giving. One can enjoy peace and prosperity by giving, not by aggrandising. Aggrandisation corrodes the personality. Tapas is conserving energy and directing it towards the achievement of the higher ideal. The mind gets attracted to the worldly indulgences. Intellect needs to guide the mind and prevent its deviation from the set path. 
Thus when one develops a powerful intellect and imbibe higher values of life he is bound to enjoy peace and prosperity.

Islamic State kills 25 Iraqi militiamen near Kirkuk
	

THE HINDU, 19th FEBRUARY, 2018- Islamic State militants ambushed a convoy of government-backed militia fighters near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk late on Sunday, killing at least 25 of them, police and militia commanders said on Monday.
Police and militia commanders had earlier said 12 militia fighters were killed in the ambush and at least 10 were missing, but security forces later found another 13 bodies dumped nearby with multiple gunshot wounds.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.
A security official said Iraqi security forces were pursuing the Islamic State militants who disguised themselves in police uniforms to carry out the attack.
Iraqi forces launched an operation this month to consolidate control of a mountain area near the oil city of Kirkuk to be used for the transit of Iraqi oil, highlighting concern about mountainous terrain where two armed groups are active. Iraq declared victory in December over Islamic State militants who seized control of nearly a third of the country in 2014. However, the group continues to carry out attacks and bombings in Baghdad and different parts of the country.

Local Govt. bodies likely to be exempted
	
Parliament was informed that the 25 per cent representation of women in local government bodies would be implemented, other than in those where it was not practically possible.
The matter was raised by joint opposition MP Dallas Alahapperuma in the House today saying it was unfair to overlook the 25 per cent women representation in local bodies, because the SLPP had already ensured its implementation.
However, Minister Lakshman Kiriella said no decision was made to by-pass the rule relating to women's representation.
Joint opposition MP Keheliya Rambukwella who also confirmed this said it was decided to exempt the LG bodies from the rule where it was practically impossible to implement it.
JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene said it had been decided to immediately permit the formation of local bodies where the parties had obtained an absolute majority. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

People wish not  only Govt. but also President will step down
	
Local authorities face gridlock in forming administrationas a result
	Newelectoral system has positive features
	Dilemma in nominating female candidates
	Govt. should work for a general election
	SLPP will introduce fresh policies
	Lawmakers failed to ensure safety nets to avoid any gridlock

Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa, who spearheads the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), speaks to Daily mirrorabout the way forward following the conclusion of local government polls and the present impasse of the government.

QHow do you look to future politics in the wake of the current electoral victory
This is like a cricket match series. There are different kinds of matches. We have 20-20, one day and test matches. We have won the 20-20 game now. It is probably the most difficult one. Next we will have to face the Provincial Councils elections. Afterwards, we will have the Presidential or General election. We will face them according toa systematic plan.

There is public mistrust on the proposed Constitution. People feared the country would be destabilised. They voted against the alienation of national assets and curtailment of subsidies

QYou faced the election under a new system. What is your experience
The initial part of the new electoral system was worked out by us during our time. Today, we are criticised for certain defects in it. In fact, we have to be credited for the positive features of it. We introduced the electoral ward system. We did away with preferential voting. This is a mixed system.
QIn most cases, the party that won has been unable to secure an absolute majority to establish the administration. What are your thoughts on this
It is the duty of lawmakers to pave the way for smooth administration. They should make it a point to avoid any form of gridlock. That is to be kept in mind when evolving legislation. There were safety nets introduced when enacting the Proportional Representation System during the time of late President J.R. Jayewardene. The bonus seat is one such safety net meant to avoid any gridlock.
Another is the cutoff point. The present rulers did away with both of them. In the world, we find countries having both these safety nets. Or else, there is at least one of them. Sri Lanka is the only country to act regardless of both.
This is a serious gridlock. Not that alone, there is a gridlock in ensuring women representation. In fact, there are instances where the party that polled the second largest number of votes can block the formation of administration in the local authority concerned. For instance, the United National Party (UNP) as the second largest party for the Kaduwela Municipal Council got nine seats from the list. We did not get any from the list because we won the wards. The UNP has to nominate women to all nine slots from the list. One party is compelled to ensure women representation for the entire council. If the UNP does not act in this regard, we cannot form the administration. For a council, 25 per cent of slots should be filled withfemale candidates.
The UNP can do it in Kaduwela. Similarly, the SLPP can do the same in the Colombo and Negombo Municipal Councils. If we do not nominate our female representatives, the UNP cannot form the administration.
This is a transparent electoral system. It is a positive feature. It made way for a peaceful election. The election was conducted at a local, village level. Counting was alsodone locally.
The Presidents party secured only 13 per cent of votes. Even the JVP suffered the same fate. It could not win even a single ward. The vote base of the TNA has also dwindled
QHow are you planning to form the administration in the councils you won
People have given us a great responsibility. We act with responsibility. People were considerate about three aspects at this election. One is to elect a team of representatives representing people at a given local body. Also, this election was the chance for the government to get an evaluation report from people on its performance during the last three years. People also registered their protest on what the government is contemplating to do in the future. There is public mistrust on the proposed Constitution. People feared the country would be destabilised. They voted against the alienation of national assets and curtailment of subsidies.
QConfusion and uncertainty have taken over the central government after LG polls results were announced. How do you see it
I mentioned the matters considered by people in rejecting this government. Some of them are directly relevant to the central administration. For the first time in history, people voted against the government at a local election. We won a bulk of councils defeating the party that is in power at the centre. The UNP assumed it could win as the ruling party, but it was proven wrong. There are instances where the ruling party resigns from governance.
When the British gave a verdict asking the ruling party to quit the European Union, the government resigned.

Ours is a party founded on the principles of Mahinda Chinthana. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is our iconic leader
QDoes it mean that the government should resign making way for a general election
This is a situation that demands resignation of not only the government but also the President. I do not say it in that sense. But it is the wish of the people. The Presidents party secured only 13 per cent of votes. Even the JVP suffered the same fate. It could not win even a single ward. The vote base of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) has also dwindled.
QIt is not easy to get a parliamentary election at this hour because there has to be a resolution passed with a two-thirds majority. How do you press for it then
Whatever the law might say, the government should respect the public opinion and take steps for an election.
For the first time in history, people voted against the government at a local election. We won a bulk of councils defeating the party that is in power at the centre. The UNP assumed it could win as the ruling party, but it was proven wrong
QHow challengingwas it for you toform the SLPP
There was a risk involved. No one in the joint opposition opposed it. Yet, there was a debate whether we could take such a risk. It was debated whether people were ready to accept a new party.
QHow do you live upto the aspirationsof people
We want to block the enactment of a new Constitution and the alienation of national assets. We have to fight for relief. Also, we should render this government politically fragile. If we can do these, it will be avictory for us.
QYou vowed to press for a sudden general election. How do yougo for it
The parliamentary group of the joint opposition and the guild of local government members have taken a decision in this regard. We will initiate necessary measures.

There is a gridlock in ensuring women representation. In fact, there are instances where the party that polled the second largest number of votes can block the formation of administration in the local authority concerned

QSLPP is yet to appoint its leader. Who will take up the leadership
There are provisions in the Constitution for this purpose. We will have a convention and decide on it at the appropriate time. Ours is a party founded on the principles of Mahinda Chinthana. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is our iconic leader.
QYou were in power for more than ten years. Is there any policy change under the new political climate
Yes. We have appointed a committee to work on these measures. It will coordinate with the general public. The government is creating economic issues every day.
QThe JO has decided to cooperate with the President to appoint Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva as the PM. Is there any chance of the SLPP joining hands with the SLFP again
We have asked the government to stop all forms of treacherous activities. We have power at the local authorities but that alone isnt sufficient to stop such actions. There is public enthusiasm. This is the time to urge the government to cast away its traitorous agenda. We will support a government that does not have any form of UNP representation.
We have asked the government to stop all forms of treacherous activities. We have power at the local authorities but that alone isnt sufficient to stop such actions
QWill you review your policies on foreign affairs and theethnic problem
We will have a lookat everything.

QHow do you intend to review yourforeign policy
There will be minimal change to our foreign policy. We can direct our foreign policy. The Tamil people believe there is an ethnic problem. We have to work for the elimination of it.

Show-jumping in Sri Lanka  Rashmin wants  to make progress
	

QWhat inspired you to become a rider
I have been riding since I was eight, but I started properly training in India back in 2015. And then in 2016 I went to Germany. I started competing last year in France. My last visit was to India. I think its genetic because my grand uncle and grandfather were in the mounted police. When we started, the only place we had for training was the Premadasa Riding School back in 2000. But that was only for general riding and the sessions werent aimed at show-jumping. Therefore if anybody wanted to train in a different discipline they had to go abroad. 
QHow does show jumping differ from horse racing
There are several disciplines when it comes to horses and sports. In racing, the entire aspect is different. In terms of Olympic sports there is show-jumping, dressage, vaulting and a few others. Show-jumping is where you need to clear jumps and not knock down any of the obstacles. Performance in 70% of these sports depends on the horse. If you have an inexperienced rider and a good horse, still the horse will do most of it, but you cant always rely on the horse as well. 
QAs you mentioned earlier, for show-jumping one has to train abroad. Tell us about the experience there.
My first visit to India was for 10 days, but in Germany the experience was totally different. There we had to work at a stable and the fact that they use hay in the stables, which we dont do, gave me a new experience. It was more of a working experience. In France we could lease a horse and luckily for me the relationship with the horse was good because we made good connection. It was like an international clinic and riders from Indonesia, Australia and Honduras took part. The clinic was held under the guidance of coach Guillaume Marcotte and lasted for three weeks. In India, it wasnt a clinic as such and I was training at the Embassy Riding School under Zeeshan Malik. The main competition was in Pondicherry and I was representing the Embassy International School since it was more like a club competition. There I was able to have two horses because it was cheaper than in France. 
QTell us about the competition in France and the recent award you won in India
They invited our Association in 2017 and it was the first time somebody won a competition under the SLEA banner. It was called Haras de Jardy done by TM Equestrian Association. Previously there had been only one other person who represented Sri Lanka, but this was the first time a Sri Lankan won at the Pondicherry Equestrian Challenge, held recently. In France I came 1st in two of the 90 cm competitions and 5th in the 1 metre Grand Prix. In the Roubaix Jumping Estivales I came 28th in the 80 cm competition. I rode on BonsBaisers Du Rouge Clo. In India I won the 80 cm Table A Open Category competition on Caveman and came 3rd in the same competition on CassinaNagra. My other placings are; 4th in the Caveman 75 cm Table A Open Category competition and 5th in Cassina Nagra. I was unfortunately was eliminated in the 90 cm competition. 
QWho is the best horse you have ridden so far
So far I have ridden only three. Of the three one was BonsBaisers Du Rouge Clo from France and two others from India. In India there was a horse called Cassie and even after four weeks I still dont know how to ride her. The fact that you cant ride also teaches you a lot. There were two horses in India who were the total opposites of each other; one was strong and the other was sensitive. The beauty of this sport is that even if you dont ride a horse you will learn a lot from each horse. However so far the French horse has been the best. 
QHow is the scope for show-jumping in other countries
If you look at Asia, countries such as India, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and China have show-jumping, but if they really want to make progress they have to go abroad. The problem in Sri Lanka is that nobody really does it and therefore there is no demand to develop the sport as well. However in India there is a demand for the sport and many people are making investments, which makes engaging in the sport a lot cheaper. 
QWe still have facilities only for general riding. What are your comments
Yes, we mainly focus on racing. Last year they put in a lot of money to bring in foreign marshals and trainers to develop racing, but in terms of other disciplines, such as show jumping and dressage, theres not much exposure. We dont have proper infrastructure nor space to practice. There is also a dearth of well-trained horses. We get down horses from India, but European horses are the best for these disciplines. In addition to that we dont have experienced instructors and competitions in Sri Lanka. Therefore if individuals need to train or compete they need to go abroad. 

QWhat challenges did you face when you initially started
Expenses wise this is the most expensive sport and it is European-dominated. If you want to be a good show-jumper you need to go abroad, but you also need the money.
Thats the biggest challenge, but India now has a lot of people who are investing on this discipline.
You can train in India with half the cost youll need in Europe and in that way its much easier to train in India. Still the biggest challenge is obtaining a financial backing because once you are trained you need to compete as well. 

QWhipping in horse races has raised concerns among animal rights activists. Is whipping a must in show jumping

You can use a whip, but its safer than racing and there are more regulations. Its not only about the speed and getting the horse to move faster. For instance if there is an over use of whips or spurs the riders get disqualified. Cruelty is not a part of the sport because there are many regulations against cruelty. I think less harm is caused to the horse when compared to racing. Most people think horse riding is a form of animal cruelty, but its no different from people training domestic animals not to litter in the house, sit or not bark. Animal welfare however is something that is looked into severely when it comes to the disciplines in horse riding. A distinction has to be made between training animals, which we all do, and animal cruelty. The benefits that sport horses enjoy are that there is more exposure, scrutiny and regulations when it comes to the well-being of the horse, advantages that pet dogs or cats might not receive. 
QWhat is your message for the youth interested in show jumping
If Im able to progress and go far I would like to train those who are interested, especially in a country that doesnt have adequate facilities and infrastructure. I think its about being more passionate about the sport. One really has to find his or her way in the sport if progress is to be made.

The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) is constantly exploring new options and breaking boundaries to continue its quest to take the Sri Lankan Marketing sphere to the next level, not just locally, but internationally as well. With nearly 50 years of experience in being the renowned National Body for Marketing, which has lead the nation towards economic prosperity by fostering the development of the nation, advising and assisting in formation, implementation and appraisal of national policies on any matter connected with marketing.

However, one cannot rest on this prestigious title because we are in for an unprecedented level of disruption where everyone will need to keep pace with a rapidly changing business environment. Asia is the Centre of global growth and it becomes imperative for Certified Professional Marketers to keep on learning, attending and participating in Conferences. The Game of Marketing was organized to achieve such an objective Said Ms Gwen Albarracin, President of the Asian Marketing federation

In todays fast-paced and changing world, information can be obtained at your fingertips. Yet, many people still find that seeking information, finding knowledge and learning new things are more effective by attending symposia and conferences conducted by experts. It is by attending breakthrough events such as these, that you learn and discover how to take control of your markets, thus enabling you easier reach of your Marketing goals, said Mr Sanath Senanayake, the CEO/Executive Director of SLIM.

Speaker to rule on national Govt. tomorrow
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said today he would inform Parliament whether the national government was still in existence and give a ruling on the validity of the Cabinet tomorrow.
He said this when the Opposition asked him about the composition of the Cabinet. "I and the Leader of the House will look into the matter and inform the House," he said.
Chief Opposition whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake who raised this matter initially said the number of ministers was increased from 30 to 40 while deputy ministers and state ministers had been increased from 40 to 45 with the approval of the House in 2015. However, he said the national government was formed for a period of two years and that period had lapsed.
"We ask questions from the ministers but we do not know whether they are ministers under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. In such a scenario how can we accept them as ministers," Mr. Dissanayake said.
Joint opposition MP Dallas Allhaperuma said the leaders of both UNP and SLFP should inform the Speaker in writing if they were continuing with the national government and asked whether Speaker had been notified by the two parties.
The Speaker said he had not been notified about the status quo yet. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

## Title: Sri Lanka  ready for IRONMAN 70.3 Colombo: Bolling
## Section: Hard talk

Sri Lanka  ready for IRONMAN 70.3 Colombo: Bolling
	
Julian Bolling, Head Coach and Director, Rainbow Swimming Academy needs little introduction as in the years gone by he put Sri Lanka on the map when representing the country in swimming. Bolling is also the Director, Pro Am Serendib, the company behind IRONMAN 70.3 Colombo, which will hit the streets of the city by the sea on Sunday (25).
QHave you done a triathlon
Yes. One in Hawaii where athletes came from the mainland (US) and I recall it being a qualifying triathlon for the IRONMAN. It wasnt a branded event at the time and it was in the late 80s/early 90s when I was quite fit in the water. It involved a one or two mile swim so I came out of the water first with my friend, got on the cycle, started to ride feeling the wind, feeling good, the speedometer said something miles per hour and I thought, thats kind of cool, and then suddenly like the wind the bike started passing me and just like that it was the end of my little saga but I managed to complete the race.
DIG Sahabandu of the Special Task Force, who died in the war, a friend of ours, organised the first triathlon in Sri Lanka back in the 80s when I was abroad. I took part in the second one he organised at Modara and it involved a 200 metre swim in the shallow end because people couldnt swim and we cycled and ranthrough Colombo.
The question is whether you are going to be fit and what IRONMAN has taught me is that I dont think the past matters  they say Julian Bolling is in the team, yes he is but to me Yasas (Hewage) and Rajan (Thananayagam) are the real story because it is not about who we were in the past but about who we are today and in my case what is beyond national swimming is life!
QWas it the full IRONMAN that you did in Hawaii
Well, it included a 50 mile bike ride and a 10 mile run and the people from the mainland said they were there to qualify for the IRONMAN and there were about 500 bikes parked when I finished my cycle ride! I recall going up a hill and running out of energy. I was on the easiest gear but my feet were locked onto the pedals which you have to hold on to, to stay stationary then hold on to the pillar and unclip so I couldnt stop half way up the hill and I was about to fall and this Marine started yelling at me encouraging me  and when I got to the top of the hill I saw the end!
QWhy didnt you participate in a triathlon again
They didnt have any which is very sad. I think we should remember DIG Sahabandu who died in a landmine as he pioneered this through the YMCA because once he died it discontinued.

We want to host a few local triathlons and duathalons which are obviously fitness based. Wed like to get more people on the road, for the non-walkers to walk and for the walkers to start running so lets see how it evolves

QWhat happens once you finish competitive swimming
Either you put on weight or you go into coaching and still put on weight!
The question is whether you are going to be fit and what IRONMAN has taught me is that I dont think the past matters  they say Julian Bolling is in the team, yes he is but to me Yasas (Hewage) and Rajan (Thananayagam) are the real story because it is not about who we were in the past but about who we are today and in my case what is beyond national swimming is life!
One thing is, I hate to swim. I try to swim because we have a masters swimming programme at our club but once I coach for two hours in the morning and once I see the masters guys coming I dont want to get into the same pool that I was staring at for two hours, plus Ive done this sport.
I play badminton as a recreational sport and I personally feel that sports like swimming, cycling and running are monotony at the highest level.
Yasas story is interesting, he loved cycling but he didnt compete but we competed. Can I compete in another sport So maybe IRONMAN gives me the right balance if I go into a triathlon with fitness in mind, but I think the more I hear about the story of the IRONMAN athletes, it has opened my mind to what sport is, even for a competitive athlete.
This whole winning business versus being the best you can be  I have taken a leaf well, more than a leaf, a whole tree out of the All Blacks, a team that is the most successful team in the world that says winning is not important and with IRONMAN too, winning isnt important. So here are two extremes of an 80 year old citizen, from Hong Kong who is competing and the All Blacks, the best team in the world, the most successful in any sport, having the same philosophy in sport, which is to be the best you can be, take on a challenge, do something new and you will smile at the end of it. Of course a lot of training goes into it like Rajans story about being an accountant and putting in 20 hours of training a week  he forgets his television, I love my television, so everybody has to make a choice.
I surf, and if you talk about sports tourism I think surfing might be the biggest in Sri Lanka. I dont want to take anything from IRONMAN but if you see the hundreds of tourists that come here as backpackers, most of them come to surf.
I also kite surf during the off season but surfing is what I enjoy and I swim to stay in shape so I can at least survive the waves.
QWhat are the challenges of swimming in the pool versus the ocean
There is this surfer guy who plays music Jack Johnson and I was listening to one of his songs which described how the ocean is all wonderful but that it brings you jellyfish, rip currents and dangers from the elements but if you can overcome them, the rest is cool  thats on the surfing side.
The open water is as spectacular and its an Olympic sport (10km swim). In the open water you have to face the elements but in the pool whats your element Nothing, so its safe. That is why a lot of open water swimmers or triathletes do most of their training in a pool using the clock.
Dr. Jan Prins had a workshop for triathletes in Colombo and he simply said if you swim without a clock you dont get what you want. He also talked about interval training on a certain time base which helps you to be fitter when you use the clock. In the open water you dont have that clock factor. The ocean is also seasonal  theres six months of good weather here (in the West Coast) and six months in the East coast, while our fresh waters are not too safe  the fear of crocodiles exist in Diyawanna, Bolgoda or any river today so I wouldnt recommend it, while the Beira Lake  we all know why we shouldnt swim there! We have some beautiful waters which cant be used so the pool is where most open water athletes can train.
QWould you encourage a triathlete to train in the sea before a triathlon
I think they should, thats common sense but the question is how much access do you have to the sea If the ocean is in your backyard and there is no pool around or the pool is 30 minutes away but you have a busy lifestyle  then you might use the ocean so its all about those variables but you need to have your open water experience as a professional triathlete. In that cycle of training on a weekly basis I am sure they have an open water swim  I did open water swimming when I achieved my best times in 1986 Asian Games because the pool at the University of Hawaii was closed for over a week because of a water polo tournament which included 80 odd teams and was apparently the biggest tournament in the world. So here I was, a month away from my biggest meet, fully focussed or trying to be focussed, and suddenly the pool is closed so I had to go in the ocean at Ala Moana Beach and swim and I was challenged.
QWhy did you get involved with IRONMAN 70.3 Colombo
Somebody asked me, What do you want to do in life, what are your dreams and I said, Look I would like to dream together so I dont have to dream alone  that means if a few of us get together to do something to make a difference then Id like to be part of that team and thats the kind of place I am involved in, in my day to day life, working with other people as a team. Sometimes you lead the team, sometimes you are still part of the team but in the case of the IRONMAN, its a nice marriage between Yasas, Rajan and I. In a funny way, we complement each other and obviously we want this for the country. I also think theres a feel good factor that when it happens on February 25, 2018 we are going to feel like great because this is a good thing. When you talk to all the different stakeholders, the different ministries, from security to tourism and sport and the roads, everybody is so helpful because they feel this country needs events like this and I am glad that I am a part of it but the event can, not just bring in tourists to Sri Lanka but also get people going with their fitness.
As a Pro-Am company that we have registered now, we are looking at running triathlons throughout the year to encourage more locals because if you look at the numbers that are competing as Sri Lankans most of them are relay teams  a lot of triathletes dont have swimming as their primary discipline so being a swimmer is a major benefit even though the distance or the time spent in the event is way less than the other two disciplines, so I think what we would do is use the pools and have short distance swims and then add cycling and swimming and you would see more (athletes) coming in.
QDo you see a future for IRONMAN/IRONMAN 70.3 Colombo
We want to host a few local triathlons and duathalons which are obviously fitness based. Wed like to get more people on the road, for the non-walkers to walk and for the walkers to start running so lets see how it evolves.
QIs swimming a factor towards people registering
The ocean is a different element, your times might be a little slower but you float better because of the buoyancy factor but its serious because of the current and there will always be a current, strong or mild in the ocean, but if it helps you one way, then you have to swim against it thats the fun part.
You also see people taking up challenges  in the first sea swim practice, we completed 400m  800m and then the full 1.9km which is huge and there was a guy who I accompanied in the first race. He was one of the slowest, so I stayed with him on my surf board and we went up to the 400m mark and he hung onto my board for a short while and chatted. He said the last time he got into the water (this guy is in his 40s) was when he was six years old and that was a drowning incident. So you dont need the IRONMAN because that in itself was a personal achievement, and you cant add a value to that feeling that he has and what he has accomplished. The tsunami brought a fear factor to children in Sri Lanka so we did a programme called, Swim Lanka, where we gave the beach back to the kids affected (by the tsunami), if not they would have had lifelong scars and this gentleman Im sure overcame a major issue in his life and got over that fear factor.

Its the selfless spirit in case of the relay teams and the idea that nothing is impossible, that makes the IRONMAN experience truly unique
QSo Sri Lanka is going places with IRONMAN
Ive been told that most of the time when they host a race for the first time they dont sell out so I think the team here has worked extremely hard and this is not about Yasas, Rajan and I, this is about the rest of the team including those volunteering and its also you guys in the media, everyone has played a role, and thats the most beautiful thing, that the highlight is not about us but about everybody from the guy who cleans the streets so lets acknowledge them too as the most important people.
QWhat are the risks involved in doing an IRONMAN
We had a drowning of a diver friend in Batticaloa, and there was a talk show on a private radio station with one discussion being why do people take risks I have taken a risk in diving and had a point of no return. Why Because I wanted to go deeper. Why Because I get a high out of it and then I break all the rules and then I run the risk. During the show we had a caller who said if you see an empty bus travelling and you see a young guy hanging on the footboard and leaning out when there are seats inside why is that Because that person gets his high out of it, which is a similar in those participating in IRONMAN but I will have to wait to see the finisher running under the arch and hitting the red carpet and you are going to see some faces and expressions that you havent seen before. So fitness is one thing but this type of thing is to challenge yourself.
We asked IRONMAN and they said there are fatalities every year but a lot of people say theyd rather die doing one of these so its a personal challenge  Its a thing between the heart and the mind and what rules.
We are going to have divers with tanks ready to go under and pick (bodies). If you are drowning you dont need a diver because you pluck them out but if somebody goes down he/she is dead. However every possible precaution has been taken including four resting pontoons along the course and surf rescue boards with lifeguards.


QWhat makes IRONMAN unique
Denis Crassiers story is incredible. Denis trains the visually impaired athletes and Punchi Banda and he got a heart attack playing third tier French rugby. He was a top end scrum half and he had two stents and hes doing all this so its encouraging because some people run into a problem and say, thats it, so thats why these stories are important.
In terms of the relay factor what I see is that one person trains because that person doesnt want to let the other two people down which is a beautiful story right there. There is a team element like in rugby where you put your body in the line for the sake of another player.
A girl withdrew because she wasnt sure if she could compete because she probably thought of the others but if it was only her she could do it and not finish it, and thats fine but when you are in a relay situation, you are looking at two others.
There is a story about an IRONMAN athlete who lost his legs in the war, an American. He attempted it and couldnt finish but he went to the finishing line and encouraged his friends when they were finishing, now, thats a story.
Its the selfless spirit in case of the relay teams and the idea that nothing is impossible, that makes the IRONMAN experience truly unique.

Three Oxfam suspects physically threatened witnesses in Hawaii
	

UK, (Daily Mail), 19 February 2018 - Oxfam confirmed three men accused of sexual misconduct in Haiti physically threatened witnesses amid an investigation in 2011. 
The bombshell revelations was revealed in the beleaguered charitys internal report on alleged abuse by staff.  The 2011 report said there was more needed to be done to stop problem staff working for other charities. 
But despite the warning, a number of men connected with alleged abuse later took on roles at other charities. 
The report also reveals that the charity treated Mr van Hauwermeiren leniently to protect its reputation.
Last week, Mr van Hauwermeiren denied ever using prostitutes in Haiti.
But the report alleges that when an Oxfam team was sent to Haiti to investigate, Mr van Hauwermeiren confirmed that he had used prostitutes at the residence procured for him by the charity.
Oxfam allowed him to resign in a phased and dignified exit if he agreed to help with the investigation. He leftwithin a month.
The charity, which has nearly 10,000 staff working across more than 90 countries, released a redacted version of the report. 
Oxfam said that it wanted to be as transparent as possible about the decisions it made.

Top US officials tell the world to ignore Trumps tweets
	

By Michael Birnbaum, Griff Witte (c) 2018, MUNICH 
Amid global anxiety about President Donald Trumps approach to global affairs, U.S. officials had a message to a gathering of Europes foreign policy elite this weekend: pay no attention to the man tweeting behindthe curtain. 
U.S. lawmakers - both Democrats and Republicans - and top national security officials in the Trump administration offered the same advice publicly and privately, often clashing with Trumps Twitter stream: the United States remains staunchly committed to its European allies, is furious with the Kremlin about election interference and isnt contemplating a preemptive strike on North Korea to halt its nuclear programme. 
But Trump himself engaged in a running counterpoint to the message, taking aim on social media at his own national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, because he forgot on Saturday to tell the Munich Security Conference that the results of the 2016 werent affected by Russian interference, a conclusion that is not supported by U.S. intelligence agencies. They say they will likely never be able to determine whether the Russian involvement swung the election toward Trump. 
The determination to ignore Trumps foreign-policy tweets has been bipartisan.The question of whom they should believe - the president or his advisers - has befuddled European officials. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel confessed Saturday that he didnt know where to look to understand America. 
Is it deeds Is it words Is it tweets he asked. 
He said he was not sure whether he could recognize the United States.

Will challenge Active Liability Management Bill in SC: JO
	
The joint opposition (JO) said today it would file legal action in the Supreme Court challenging the Active Liability Management Bill, which was presented to Parliament on Monday.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardana said the Bill violated the Constitution and basic human rights.
The Bill permits the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the Central Bank (CB), to obtain a foreign or a domestic loan not exceeding 10 per cent of the unsettled loans of the previous fiscal year. If the unsettled loan amount is Rs.10 trillion, the Prime Minister will be able to obtain a loan of Rs.1 trillion. The CB bond scam had occurred when attempting to raise Rs.1 billion. The consequence of attempting to obtain Rs.1 trillion in this manner will be unfathomable, he told a news briefing.
The MP said the standard procedure of obtaining a loan was to go through the CB's Public Debt Department and that the new Billalso allowed for the previous years' appropriation bills to be disregarded.
Appropriation Bills have been approved by Parliament with the two-thirds majority and the new Active Liability Management Bill allows the Prime Minister to obtain exorbitant loans by disregarding them, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

70 years of independence but... Indias Dalit farmers still landless
	

While a majority of Indian farmers cultivate their own land, Dalit farmers in much of the country continue to work for wages, data released last week by the Census of India confirms.
The census separates farmers into two categories  cultivators, who have an ownership stake in the land, and agricultural labourers, who work for wages on land they do not own.
Dalit farmers are more likely than other farmers to work for wages. Yet the situation is hardly the same everywhere, accoring to census data from 2011.
In states with histories of feudalism, Dalits are much more likely to work as agricultural labourers. In Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, nearly all Dalit farmers are agricultural labourers. In most districts, the figure is above 90%.
Economists say concessions to farmers, such as the new minimum support prices announced in the union budget, are more likely to benefit farmers who own their land than those who work for wages.
