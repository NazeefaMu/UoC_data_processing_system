AIADMK sacks Panneerselvam and 19 others
	
Hours after the Supreme Court upheld her conviction in disproportionate assets case, AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala today expelled 20 rebel leaders from the primary membership of the party.
However, 12 MPs and eight MLAs, who supported chief minister O Panneerselvam, were spared. The only MLAs who were expelled are Panneerselvam and school education minister K Pandiarajan.
In a two-page statement, Sasikala said the cadres should not have any truck with the expelled leaders in future. "The expelled members have violated party principles and brought disrepute," she said.
Incidentally, the Panneerselvam camp has already moved the Election Commission of India seeking its intervention not to consider the claims of Sasikala that she was appointed as the general secretary of the party, citing the bylaws of the AIADMK. (The Times of India)

## Title: Annual meeting of  ?The Ceylon Scooter Club?

Annual meeting of  ?The Ceylon Scooter Club?
	
While car people have the wherewithal to form clubs and hold meets and rallies, the humbler two wheel crowd have lacked such organizational ability. There are several small and scattered groups of motorcycle riders all over, but the Ceylon Scooter Club is perhaps the largest and best organised body of its kind in Sri Lanka right now. About 50 machines and twice that number of people turned up for their annual meeting on Feb. 04, held this time at the Mahaveli Centre, Colombo 07. ??
It was a colourful event with brightly painted Vespas and Bajajs visible everywhere. Some members came in colourful sarongs while others opted to pay more attention to their machines than dress, with some machines covered with pictures and graffiti. Despite its colonial-sounding name, the CSC was formed just a decade ago by a handful of young enthusiasts. Today it has members all over the country, and members cover the social spectrum from mechanics to businessmen and expatriates. ??
It?s open to classic scooters (loosely defined as older than 1990s registration) and Italian Vespas seem to pre-dominate, though closely followed by Indian machines. Once familiar names such as Douglas and Lambretta have become rare sights. Most of the older machines on show were the seemingly indestructible Vespa 150cc?s from the 1960s and 70s. But That durability owes much to the availability of spares. Given that fact, it?s quite understandable that the owner of Kuruppu Motors, Panchikawatta was invited this time as chief guest. ??
?
?
S. Kuruppuarachchi as well as his son Kushan (a scooter enthusiast who rode a Bajaj Classic for the event) are important to the existence of the country?s small and struggling scooter community. While they are not the only scooter spare parts dealers in Colombo, their knowledge, stock of spares (new parts imported from Italy and India as well as old and junked machines) enthusiasm for scooters and willingness to help are crucial in keeping the dwindling number of classic scooters running. ??
India too, plays a big part in the classic scooter story. Bajaj went into the scooter business by making Vespas under license, and changed the name to Bajaj (with different styling) when the license expired. LML too, made Vespas in India. The scooter went out of fashion when Bajaj shifted to making motorcycles. But these classic machines are avidly sought by enthusiasts today to be restored, even getting exported to Europe. Similarly, classic scooters have become fashionable in Sri Lanka as well. ??
?
?
Kuruppuarachchi recalled that he owned his first scooter back in 1961, when the parents of many CSC members were still in school. Unlike many car clubs, where organizers tend to be grey-haired, the CSC is run by a young crowd. The launching of an official website was announced, including a knowledge hub where scooter owners have access to technical advise, service manuals and other technical data. The website offers too, a ?help? network of garages and mechanics all over the island in case of breakdowns and emergencies. ??
Along with spare parts dealers, mechanics are supremely important to scooter riders. Those who know how to diagnose and fix a classic scooter are now a rare breed. The CSC has a network of such mechanics and several were invited to the meeting ? K. A. Sumanadasa, Asoka Jayasuriya, Joseph, L. R. S. Pieris and L. R. S. Nishantha. ??
The club expects to hold four annual events such as two-day or three-day scooter tours. After the meeting?s conclusion at noon, members rode to the Independence Square for a photo shoot. This is evidently an outfit which runs on a mixture of goodwill, enthusiasm and an abiding love for scooters. ? ??

Another top team member in the meantime made a bold statement at a public function that a reshuffle was close at hand. This provided an excuse to the already agitated top team member to inquire from Number One whether there was any truth in the statement.?

Dehiwala ZOO Cruelty to Animals through Exhibition
	
Hearing of the increasing protests against the inhuman treatment of animals at the Dehiwala Zoo the Daily Mirror?set out to investigate the matter by visiting the zoo and observing the living conditions of the animals. We spoke to the relevant authorities, environmentalists, activists and conservationists and were able to gather their opinions on the maintenance and management of the zoo. ?
	The zoo is around?2-3 acres,?therefore space becomes a perennial issue
	
	
	We need to wait for another?2 years?and?see how the?zoo progresses

Perceptions need to change
Jagath Gunawardene -?Senior Environmental Lawyer
Senior environmental lawyer, Jagath Gunawardene spoke on the problems observed in the zoo. He showed us through an environmental perspective that the Dehiwala zoo, being in a residential area, conformed to the legalities of the criteria that are set down for any residential area zoo. We inquired about the problems that the Daily Mirror observed in our investigation. ??
The initial issue was the dirty water or in some cases the lack of water given to the animals, he said, ? The ways and means that the zoo gives water is specific to the animal. Some animals also prefer algae infested waters. However, the zoo changes the water of the animals on a daily basis.? ??
Space requirements for most animals are insufficient

We inquired on whether this compromised the comfort of the animal. He said, ? That is a common problem in almost all the zoos. Though animals are given similar conditions of their environment in the wild, space is a problem. The zoo is around 2-3 acres, therefore space becomes a perennial issue. If we observe it from an animal rights point of view, we can present many ideological arguments. But, what we need to expect from the zoo is if they can make an environment which does not create tension within the animal. There is another problem, whenever an animal has a confined place to itself, most visitors complain stating that the animal is difficult to observe. Rather than the zoo, it is the perception of the people that need to change in the context of Sri Lanka. For instance, the zoo has a conflicted attitude towards the elephant dance, but the visitors, especially children want the dance. Personally I don?t want animals doing things that are unnatural to their behaviour. There was a time when the dances were stopped because the elephants were not healthy. But, people complained and recovered the dances. Therefore the authorities are in a vulnerable position where they have to cater to many types of people. We need to also understand that one of the main authorities of the zoo is the Ministry of Tourism. Their aim was to maximize visitation and make the zoo a tourist objective. Thus, they were not very keen in accommodating the idea of making the zoo a more animal friendly place. Now fortunately they do not have as much control.? ??
?
?
"The treasury is not allocating enough funds for the functioning of the zoo. Since the zoo generates a large amount of income, it goes directly into the treasury. "
?
He added, ? Another problem is that the treasury is not allocating enough funds for the functioning of the zoo. Since the zoo generates a large amount of income, it goes directly into the treasury. The treasury, however has the discretion on the amount of funds that they should allocate to the zoo.? ??
He also spoke of the behavioural patterns of the animals that could be observed in the zoo, ? If we take crocodiles for example they are usually inactive animals. Lethargy is their way of life. But, in every zoo the animals are exposed to the public coming close to them. This induces high amounts of stress in the animals. The London zoo is notorious for that factor. Therefore, most zoos have hidden enclosures, where when animals feel stressed out they can retreat to that enclosure. At the moment the zoo is at a cross road where they are in the process of changing the caged concept to the enclosure concept. We need to wait for another 2 years and see how the zoo progresses.? ??
Mr. Gunawardene also showed that most environmental authorities such as himself directly spoke to the zoo authorities when they saw a problem. He said that the zoo authorities were prompt in their action in rectifying the problem. ??
?
?We should put an end to this exhibition of animals. It is absolutely cruel.?
Sagarika Rajakarunanayake - Animal Rights Activist
Animal rights activist, Sagarika Rajakarunanayake stood by her stance against zoos,?The concept of a Zoo is contrary to the freedom that animals should have. I think that the sooner that this country decides we should not have caged and imprisoned animals it will be better for us as a country compassionate to animals and for the animals.? ??
?We should put an end to this exhibition of animals. It is absolutely cruel. Even though authorities say that they?ve been given more room they are all in enclosures, at the end of the day they are all prisoners.? ??
?Speaking of the attitude of the authorities of the zoo Ms. Rajakarunanayake said, ?Throughout, animal rights activists and animal lovers have voiced their opinion on the treatment of the zoo animals and zoo authorities have been forced to adopt more liberal actions/attitudes. But that?s not good enough. Because the welfare and the compassionate treatment of animals is not left to animal rights activists and animal lovers. The people who run the zoo should have a deep concern for their animals and the feelings of these animals. They should be the first to defend their cause. What happens usually in the Zoo is, if some wrong has been done to an animal, it is either hidden by the authorities or it is said that the animal is at fault. Instead of looking into the issue and inquiring about it, they take a defensive stance.? ??
?
?
"If the elephants are swaying or moving their faces from side to side it is a sign of stress"
?
She further stated that the message we send to children is important,?We should not keep imprisoned animals, especially since we?re giving a wrong message to our younger generation, especially from rural areas where they think that animals should be caught from their habitat and caged for some people?s pleasure.? ??
Commenting on the behaviour of the animals she said, ?If the elephants are swaying or moving their faces from side to side it is a sign of stress. They are not in a happy situation. And half an hour of exercise per day is not enough, they are not humans. Elephants need a free and spacious environment, at least where they can move around and not be closely chained. The animals and those in charge should have a very close relationship and there should be a lot of love and affection.? ??
?

?We made animal friendly enclosures.?
Dhammika Malsinghe - ?Director General of the Zoological Department
The Director General of the Zoological Department Dhammika Malsinghe said there was a ?master plan? underway in support of the welfare of animals. ?We have removed old cages and have made animal friendly enclosures. We have made five such enclosures for the Bengal Tiger, rusty spotted cat (Kola diviya), fishing cat and several other animals. These areas are more spacious for them to roam and there is very minimum steel used,? she said. ??
?
?
"We are constructing new places for Chimpanzees in old concrete cages"
Referring to the construction going on currently she said that the places where tigers and lions were previously housed which led to much criticism, have now been demolished to create suitable lodging for Sudu viyagrayas and jaguars. ??We are constructing new places for Chimpanzees in old concrete cages. We also hope to minimize fences and enlarge the area that houses deer, so it is more spacious,? she said. ? ?The Animal Hospital and the animal park are to be reconstructed in line with modern technology. We have been constructing a free area for elephants for several years. It has been delaying due to several reasons. But we hope to end construction this year. Then elephants will not be tied up and instead they will be able to roam about freely,? she added. ??
?Drinking water is provided daily. We change pond water regularly but the frequency depends on the animal. The water in ponds for hippos is changed daily. The water in the bathing ponds for elephants is changed once in three days,? she said. ?

?Lethargic behaviour is not normal in animals?
Dr. Eranda Rajapaksha - Senior Lecturer of the Department of Veterinary Clinical Science - University of Peradeniya
We inquired from Dr. Eranda Rajapaksha - Senior Lecturer of the Department of Veterinary Clinical Science - Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science - University of Peradeniya on a scientific explanation on lethargic behaviour that was apparent in zoo animals. ?
?
"Lethargic behaviour is not normal in animals. This is not happening only in the Dehiwala Zoo"
?Lethargic behaviour is not normal to be seen in animals. This is not happening only in the Dehiwala Zoo. I have been to more than 50 zoos in the world and except for a very few zoos, many animals show this lethargic behaviour due to the confinement, frustration and boredom. The prominent cause is that it is not their natural habitat. Even in the safari parks like San Diego, animals are restricted to a certain level. Animals show their boredom in different behaviours. Some animals show stereotypic behaviour - they keep repeating the same action, specially lions and bears, keep walking from wall to wall is an example. Some animals look like stargazing, and rocking in elephants are examples of stereotypic behaviour. There are other sets of animals that are undergoing stress.They are very inactive because they see no ? ?point in moving.? he explained. ??
?Their food preferences are wide. Some animals should be supplied with fresh food as they dislike stale food.? Finally commenting on the night time park concept, Dr Eranda pointed out how disturbing it can be for animals, specially for nocturnal animals. ??

?Zoo issue should be a matter for CID and International police??
Rukshan Jayawardhana ? Conservationist
??Dehiwala Zoo should be closed down and we should go for the open sanctuary concept that is currently being used by countries like Costa Rica. In that way the animals and tourism both can be saved,? Rukshan Jayawardhana, Conservationist and the President of Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka. ??
?
"The Zoo cannot be developed until the government takes stringent action against the continuing situation"
?
?The Zoo cannot be developed until the government takes stringent action against the continuing situation. The former government appointed director is a heartless person who has no caring attitude for animals or their welfare,? he said. ??
??There are some people in the higher management who take advantage in using the zoo and its activities for economic gains. Innocent animals are caged, abused, smuggled and the animals have died. And elephant dances are an act of cruelty. Six months ago the government appointed a committee to investigate the zoo but still no results have been produced. The Dehiwala Zoo has caught wild animals that were kept in the zoo for a while and then traded to foreign countries, which is an illegal act. Illegal wildlife is the third multi billion dollar making trade in the world. Actually this zoo issue should be a matter of CID and International police,? he added. ??

Fitch revises SLIC?s outlook to Stable
	
Fitch Ratings has revised the outlook on Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation?s (SLIC) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating to Stable from Negative and affirmed the IFS rating at ?B+?.?
The rating action follows the revision of the outlook on Sri Lanka?s Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to Stable from Negative and the affirmation of the rating at ?B+? on February 9, 2017. SLIC?s IFS rating is constrained by Sri Lanka?s Long-Term Local-Currency IDR and the Negative outlook reflects the Negative outlook on Sri Lanka?s IDR. This rating review does not include SLIC?s ?AA(lka)? National Long-Term Rating and ?AA(lka)? National IFS rating.
SLIC?s ratings reflect its established franchise and market position in Sri Lanka, 99.9 percent state ownership and importance to the government as the largest state-owned insurer.?
Offsetting these strengths are significant investments in non-core subsidiaries and a high equity exposure, which weighs on its risk-based capital. If the sovereign ratings are upgraded in the future and the constraints on SLIC?s IFS rating are relieved, Fitch would take similar rating action on SLIC?s IFS rating. Conversely, a downgrade of Sri Lanka?s ratings will lead to downgrade of SLIC?s IFS rating.?

The owner had wanted to dispose of this land and the Walauwa on it as he realized that he could not put up any new building or develop the land for any commercial purposes for it involved clearing the forest cover on the hill slope protecting the perennial water resource. However, this aspect had not bothered the buyer.?
Prior to purchasing the land, the powerful political authority had asked the responsible state officials whom he had sent for whether they could cite any reason for disallowing the proposed hotel project and the latter had reportedly answered in the negative for fear of incurring the displeasure of the political authority.
The sibling of the political authority has already finalized the preliminaries to start work on the hotel project, they say.?

Political party behind appointment of new HC judge
	
The government has made contradictory statements regarding the appointment of High Court Judge Ramanathan Kannan making one wonder whether it was a political appointment, former MP G L Peiris said today.
He said he had previously practised as a lawyer in the Baticaloa courts.
?Justice Minister Wejeyadasa Rajapakshe had said recently that political party was keen on appointing the particular person to the position," Mr. Peiris said.
He said the Judicial Services Association (JSA) had met the Chief Justice who had reportedly said Mr. Kannan was nominated by President Maithripala Sirisena.
?The Chief Justice had revealed that the president appointed Mr. Kannan as a HC judge on a request made by the Sri Lanka Bar Association but it later claimed that it had not made such a request. It is a mystery how the appointment was made,? he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: Ragging perpetuated under the guise of promoting university ?sub-culture?

Ragging perpetuated under the guise of promoting university ?sub-culture?
	
?They call it the Upa Sanskruthiya (subculture). We call it ragging.? ?
Following our recent expos? titled ?Ragging continues to torment undergraduates?, on the alleged attack of a second year anti-ragging undergraduate at the Peradeniya University, Daily Mirror? has received more reports on incidents of ragging this year. The stories shared by parents and students are reflective of a large number of cases of traumatic ragging that go unreported and unaddressed. ??
Since childhood, our parents and teachers have inculcated in us that respect should be earned and not demanded. However, in our campuses, seniors demand respect and reprimand freshers for not showing it. Freshers are compelled to greet the seniors in the morning. In fact they are interrogated as to how many seniors they greeted during table talks, mostly in the canteen. Freshers are required to come early and stay late so they can ?participate? in the involuntary ?discussions?. They are forced to learn and memorize the university jargon and kavi poems. This is supposed to be part of the university student subculture. However, this is ragging in operation at its mildest form. ?
Freshers are verbally abused in filth. Their self-esteem is crushed. They are belittled and demeaned. They are humiliated before others. This is undeniably the experience of the majority. also learns that male students are more susceptible to physical ragging while female students are sexually harassed as well. We have also had a gruesome history of suicides triggered by ragging. Yet when ragging is exposed and the relevant student body is questioned, they argue that only a few bad apples resort to ?ragging? and that the reported incident is not even related to ragging. They even go on to say that the victim had concocted the story to sling mud at them. ??
Student Unions declare that they are against ragging, though this stance is questionable in the light of the reports Daily Mirror ?has received. Freshers, under the conditions of anonymity fearing repercussions, told us they were ragged wherever the seniors caught them; be it in the toilet or the canteen. One student expressed fear and added that the raggers were ?criminals? and that she had never met people as ?evil as them?. You are harassed for refusing or missing the rag as well. The dress code is very restrictive, inconvenient and unjustifiable. Students said it seemed as if the raggers ?got a kick out of ragging the freshers.? Seniors are able to convincingly win the loyalty of certain freshers who become informants and betray their fellow peers. Freshers are also in a dilemma as refusing the rag leads to being an ?outcast? and they would not be permitted to join clubs and societies subsequently, as seniors would harass them. ??
Seniors make freshers dependent on them early on by disparaging the lecturers, emphasising the difficulty of assignments and the need for the seniors? notes. Freshers are thus compelled to cooperate with seniors. When juniors are overpowered, being submissive may seem the better option as standing against seniors can attract attention in the form of further physical and verbal attacks as we have seen in the Peradeniya University. This is where university authorities, including lecturers, play a pivotal role in encouraging students to stand against ragging and providing moral support, instead of turning a blind eye to its occurrence. ??
Following are the testimonies of parents who have been driven to desperation as a result of the mental trauma their children have undergone at the hands of the raggers. ??
Fresher assaulted, and currently under the care of a psychiatrist. ?
Lionel Wickramasinghe, a lawyer from Gampaha, told of how his son who was ragged and assaulted was now seeking treatment at the Ragama Hospital. ?Before the inauguration, seniors conducted unofficial meetings in each district. They contacted students over the phone and through social media,? said Wickramasinghe. At the meeting in Gampaha which his son attended, he had been severely scolded and had refused to go to university, though he had subsequently agreed to it. ??
His son was to stay at the hostel of the Ruhuna University. On the first day itself, only a group of ten students were allowed to go to the canteen to get dinner. However the students who were permitted to go, including Wickramasinghe?s son, were scolded derogatorily. On the other hand, the students who were not allowed to go were rebuked for being flimsy and listening to others? orders. ??
?He had been walking alone on an incomplete concrete road between the hostel and the canteen when seniors stopped him, scolded him ?and asked him to undress, which he had refused to do,? he said. ??
That same day seniors had halted the water connection to the hostel bathrooms. ?Freshers had been woken up at 1 a.m. and ragged. The staff warden, who was in a room close by had not even come to look into it,? he added. ??
Thereafter, the son visited his parents in Gampaha and returned to the university after a week. On the day he returned, on his way to the canteen, seniors approached him and took him to the seniors? hostel. The seniors slapped the fresher on both cheeks, beat him on his back and asked him to undress, to which he refused. ?He was pulled by the collar. There are nail marks on his neck. The buttons of his shirt have been ripped off. He has been beaten severely,? his father said. ??
Unable to bear the assault, the son fainted and regained consciousness after about fifteen minutes. The seniors scolded him saying he was pretending. He fainted once again and was kicked. ?Hearing footsteps, they pushed my son out of the dormitory. He had walked out of the university with difficulty, passing a security guard as well. He took a bus home,? said the father. Wickramasinghe said his son pleaded with him not to complain to the police, as his peers could be ragged even more as a result of it. ??
?
?
"When it?s reported, we inform the university and they initiate action. Without someone coming forward we can?t punish anyone"
?
?We met the UGC chairman seeking a transfer. When my son was narrating his experience, he fainted due to his traumatic experience. The Vice Chancellor was also contacted. He asked us to come to the university, saying he would take care of it,? he said. However, they had not been successful in procuring a transfer. ?
?The boys had been asked to act as if they were in pornography.? ?
The parents of a fresher, a hosteller at the Rajarata Management Faculty, have also been very apprehensive over the frequent complaints of their daughter about ragging. She had on several occasions refused to go back to the university. According to her mother, seniors surround freshers, intimidate them and scold them in obscene language. ?Freshers have been asked to come to the canteen called ?hilton? at 6 a.m., where they are ragged. Freshers are required to remember the names of all their peers (300 students or more), their parents? names and room number. If they didn?t know these, they would be scolded and degraded inhumanly,? the mother said. ??
Lectures end by 5 p.m. However, all freshers are required to go to the canteen afterwards. Female freshers are released from the rag just before 8.30, which is the latest time to enter the hostel. Male freshers are allowed to leave before 10.30, so they could enter the hostel. ??
However, the mother said the seniors came to the boys? dormitory at 12 a.m. and ragged them till 3 a.m. ?They had been asked to act as if they were in blue films (pornographic content). One person had to play music while another pretends to be videoing it,? she said. On the day of the inauguration, the parents had been told by members of the student council at a meeting that there was no ragging in the university. However they had learned that this was far from the truth. ??
?
Ragging, a subculture; Problem is to draw the line
Professor Mohan De Silva- Chairman of the UGC ??
Ragging is a non-bailable offense. ?
	Ragging in our language is termed as a subculture by students. ?
	Seniors have not been authorized to hold ?discussions? in the canteen or exert their influence over freshers. ??
	Victims of ragging can complain to the student counsellors, to the University Grants Commission and the police.?
??
Prof. Mohan De Silva, the chairman of the University Grants Commission (UGC) said that the university had not given any power to the seniors. ?Student Councils say they teach freshers the good and the bad. But this is not what they do. Universities have not given student unions the power to do whatever they want to in this manner. Ragging in our language is termed as a subculture by students. The problem is to draw the line here,? he said. ??
?In the South East university, the police is involved. There have been many complaints. For the first time, students gave complaints in writing. Students have become stronger in reporting,? he said, adding that the universities have also become proactive in putting a stop to ragging. ??
?This year, there was an affidavit in the handbook on the registration process which is expected from the mother, father or guardian, that they have understood the consequences of their child getting caught for ragging. The Ragging Act of 1998 is now implemented by the judiciary and ragging is an non-bailable offense,? he noted. ??
?
?
"We don?t permit students to harass, threaten, abuse or physically attack others. We condemn such actions. We have advised students not to verbally or physically harass freshers, as that is not the way to make people tread the right path"
?
When asked about transferring students who have been ragged severely and who are unable to return to the university, Prof. De Silva said that it was not possible. ?Transfers are not possible as students are given a university based on their z-score and whether they have asked for it. There is a complicated equation. It is done through a software and if you change one, the whole thing will change. There are so many cases where students have got ragged and hammered. At the same time, there are people who use ragging to procure a transfer,? he said. ??
Referring to the options available for students to complain, Prof. De Silva said the main problem was that students did not complain. ?There are student counsellors. Their telephone numbers are given to the students. But students are scared to complain as the environment is such. They can ring the UGC. There is a separate number for this purpose. When it?s reported, we inform the university and they initiate action. Without someone coming forward we can?t punish anyone. This is our problem. But this situation is changing,? he said. He added that students could complain to the police as well. ?
?
?We condemn?such actions?
Mangala Maddumage- the Acting convener of the ISUF
??
?We don?t permit students to harass, threaten, abuse or physically attack others.? ?
As Lahiru Weerasekara, the convener of the Inter-University Students Federation (IUSF) has been remanded for breaching bail conditions, Daily Mirror ?spoke to Mangala Maddumage, the Acting convener of the ISUF. When we asked him about the ?discussions? by the seniors that took place mainly during the interval but also prior to and after lectures in certain universities, he said it was essential to hold such discussions. ?When first years come to the university, the seniors go and speak to the students for one hour from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. Problems that arise during their university education are addressed. First years need this help. This is what happens in universities around the country,? he said. ??
?
?
"We met the UGC chairman seeking a transfer. When my son was narrating his experience, he fainted due to his traumatic experience. The Vice Chancellor was also contacted He asked us to come to the university, saying he would take care of it"
?
He added that the talks were not part of the activities of the Students? Unions. He said, however, that the student unions were informed beforehand. ??
He also said there was a programme in place to prevent ragging and that they did not accept ragging. ?With our involvement, we have been able to reduce ragging to a certain extent,? he said. ??
?We don?t permit students to harass, threaten, abuse or physically attack others. We condemn such actions. We have advised students not to verbally or physically harass freshers, as that is not the way to make people tread the right path,? he said. ??
?There are two factions, those who take part and those who don?t take part in social activities in the university. This cannot be denied,? he noted. When questioned as to whether people who did not take part were harassed, he replied in the negative, adding that he had in fact helped such students in their academic studies and that they were not penalized in anyway. ? ??There might be one or two who concoct stories of being ostracized. But this cannot be considered to be the experience of the majority,? he said. ??
After imposing the bail conditions, the additional magistrate was alleged to have remarked that though the suspects believed ragging to be good, it was prohibited by law and therefore if the suspects wanted to change the law, they would have to go to the parliament to do so. ??
Peradeniya 2nd year undergrad assaulted
Suspects bailed out and magistrate refuses to accept affidavits. ??
When the case involving the assault of the second year student, Sasinindu Patabendige came up before the Kandy Additional Magistrate last week, the seven identified suspects were bailed out while the eighth suspect was discharged, as he had not been identified by the victim during the Identification Parade. The victim had been assaulted in the Peradeniya university premises on January 18, for speaking out against the ragging of freshers. ??
The prosecution wanted the suspects to handover an affidavit stating that they would not interfere with the witnesses or take part in ragging. However, when the affidavit was submitted by the Defense counsel, the additional magistrate did not accept it, saying the oral submission was adequate. ??
?
TIMELINE ?
In 1975, a 22-year-old female student, Rupa Rathnaseeli of the Faculty of Agriculture, became paralyzed as a result of jumping from the second floor of the hostel to escape physical ragging. It was reported that she was about to have a candle inserted into her vagina just before she had jumped out of the hostel. She committed suicide in 2002. ?

SAITM CEO'S Car Shot At: Doubts over complaint to Police
	
Police personnel, investigating the incident in which SAITM Chief Executive Officer Dr. Sameera Senaratne?s car was shot at, said today his complaint appeared contradictory.
A senior police officer said they were awaiting the Government Analyst?s report before making any further comments on the shooting and added that the Police were investigating the incident using the video footage from CCTV cameras in the vicinity of the shooting.
Meanwhile, the Government Analyst?s Department said the report would be handed over within three weeks.
The SAITM CEO escaped unhurt after two men riding a motorcycle wearing full-face helmets opened fire at his car near the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Campus in Malabe on February 6.
The shooting took place when the CEO was leaving the SAITM campus and had gone about 850 metres towards Chandrika Kumaranatunga Mawatha. The assailants who had been in front of the vehicle had damaged the windscreen.
His car and clothes were sent to the Analyst's Department for analysis. Police protection was also provided to Dr. Senaratne after the incident.
The SAITM CEO is said to have gone abroad amid the investigations. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

SAITM protest; 13 TTU?s join hands with IUSF
	
Thirteen Teachers? Trade Unions (TTU) including Sri Lanka Teachers? Union (SLTU) yesterday confirmed their support to the Inter University Students? Federation (IUSF) in the campaign to abolish the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
As a trade union which represents over 228,000 of teachers and principals, SLTU Secretary Joseph Stalin said that the entire government work force opposed the government?s twisted resolution on the SAITM issue. ?
?After the Unity government came in to power they issued a circular on 28th January and started collecting money from the students and gradually privatize the Education system. In the 2017 budget they have given 44 private schools to the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs to monitor them which is clearly a step to legalize them,? he said.
He further said that on behalf of the SAITM, the Sectorial oversight committee had proposed to provide clinical facilities in the hospitals at Nuwara Eliya, Horana, Wathupitiwala and Gampaha.
?Why the government can?t start a medical faculty in Sabaragamuwa University? To do so, they have to change the Rathnapura Hospital to a teaching hospital which has fewer facilities,? he said.
He said that the Minister of Higher Education Lakshman Kiriella recently stated that he would bring another three more private institutions like SAITM.
However, Mr. Stalin said that even though the minister was boasting about opening another three private institutions, he would finally have to close down the SAITM as well.
He said that the entire teachers? body would not leave the university students alone to steer the fight against the government for shutting down the institution. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Some state universities are substandard: SAITM professor
	
Professor Neville Perera of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) said today that some state universities were substandard and that there were only two or three professors in the medical faculties of some of them.
Speaking at a media briefing convened by the parents of the students of SAITM, he said SAITM did not have junior lecturers. "We have only senior lecturers and professors in our institute, whereas in most of the state universities lectures are given by junior lecturers,? he said.
He added that there was nothing called minimum standards in medical education and that it did not require a huge hospital to give clinical practice to a group of about 35 students.
If minimum standards were imposed at least two universities would have to be shut down, he said.
The parents of the students of SAITM, which is currently the centre of a huge controversy, said they had admitted their children to SAITM as it had been approved by the Higher Education Ministry and the University Grants Commission (UGC).
?We enrolled our children to SAITM not out of ignorance. We admitted them as SAITM had got legal approval,? said the Private Medical College Parents' Society president, P.M.B.K. Tennakoon.
He said the verdict of the Court of Appeal should be accepted by everyone and it would be contempt of court to go against the verdict.
Mr. Tennakoon said the Sri Lanka Medical Council should respect the verdict of the court and register the SAITM students.
?The SLMC has no option but to accept the court's ruling. What they should do is not criticise SAITM but help develop its standards so that we could secure a huge amount of foreign currency,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

## Title: US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigns

US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigns
	
WASHINGTON ?Embattled White House national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned Monday night, two sources tell CNN.
His departure came just after reports surfaced the Justice Department warned the Trump administration last month that Flynn misled administration officials regarding his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States and was potentially vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians.
The move comes less than a month into the job, making him one of the shortest-serving senior presidential advisers in modern history.
The sudden exit marks the most public display yet of disarray at the highest levels of the new administration, which has faced repeated questions over a slew of controversies and reports of infighting among senior aides during its first three weeks.
The shakeup now leaves Trump without one of his closest and longest-serving advisers. Flynn had counseled Trump on foreign policy and national security matters since early in the 2016 presidential race.
Flynn was not able to definitively refute a Washington Post story late last week that his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak included communication about the sanctions. It is illegal for unauthorized private citizens to negotiate with foreign governments on behalf of the US.
The controversy intensified after the report put Pence and several senior White House advisers in an uncomfortable position, as they had denied in TV interviews weeks earlier that Flynn discussed sanctions with the ambassador. Some administration officials said Flynn must have misled Pence and others.
?The knives are out,? a White House official told CNN on Friday, noting that ?there?s a lot of unhappiness about this.?
Many expressed concern at the idea that Flynn, a retired lieutenant general who headed the Defense Intelligence Agency, would discuss sanctions with a foreign official whose calls are regularly monitored by US intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
A US official confirmed to CNN on Friday that Flynn and Kislyak did speak about sanctions, among other matters, during a December call.
But after the call was made public, Pence told CBS News on January 15 that Flynn did not talk with Kislyak about the sanctions, which the Obama administration recently levied due to Russia?s alleged interference in the 2016 elections.
?They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States? decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia,? Pence told CBS News.
On Friday, an aide close to the national security adviser told CNN that Flynn could not rule out that he spoke about sanctions on the call.
The White House official blamed much of the outcry against Flynn on a Washington culture always in search of a scalp, but people within Trump?s orbit did little to defend Flynn during appearances on Sunday news shows.
Stephen Miller, White House policy director, was asked directly about Flynn?s future on a number of Sunday talk shows. Miller responded by saying he was not the appropriate official to ask.
?I don?t have any answers today,? Miller said in response to questions about whether Flynn misled the vice president. ?I don?t have any information one way or another to add anything to the conversation.?

Valentine?s Day: Finding a Partner
	
Today being Valentine?s day, you are probably waiting for the card ?Be my Valentine ?or an E mail to that effect to reach you today. This is a deeply rooted American tradition, which has caught up with the local teenagers, especially the ones studying in International schools ?
Love is a favourite theme of many poems and a hackneyed theme of pop songs, both ancient and modern. Modern pop songs sing the praises of carnal love and are not worthy of any serious contemplation. But the older pop songs are certainly meaningful. The British poet, Rupert Brooke, said that when he fell in love, ?The world in him awoke!? When it happens to you, you would feel exactly like that, as it did happen to the writer when he fell in love. That is probably why Elvis Presley sang ?Because of love, I?m a hundred feet tall, I can bounce this world like a little old ball?. If it has not happened to you, wait till it happens to you and you would realise how true it is! ?
Perry Como sang, ?When you fall in love, the world is a wonderful place.? Doris Day sang of a similar idea, ?Everybody loves a lover, I?m a lover, Everybody loves me,Yes they do, and I love everybody, since I fell in love with you!? Franky Laine sang, ? Love is a golden ring on your finger, love isn?t just for tonight?. That song was probably aimed at all the good-time Charlies! From what the writer has observed, there seem to be plenty of them in Colombo! Jamaican Johnny topped it all singing, ?Love, love, love in the morning, love, love, love in the evening, love, love, love in the night, always good for your appetite!? So the writer advises you to try that cheap and readily available medicine, whenever you have indigestion or lack of appetite! ??
A humour columnist said, ?Love is the only game which can be played by two and both can win!? If love happens to you, here are some quotations to ponder. These quotations were from a booklet given to me by a goody-goody gentleman in Church. The first three are from anonymous writers; ??
(1) ?One of the most amazing gifts in life is to find someone who knows all your flaws, differences and mistakes, yet still loves everything about you.? ?
?
?
(2)?When you stop trying to find the right man and start becoming the right woman, the right man would find his way to you.? ?
(3)?A heart-break can be a blessing from God. It?s just His way of letting you realize He saved you from the wrong one?. ?
(4)?Happy is the man who finds a true friend and happier is he who finds that true friend is his wife?(Frank Schubert) ?
In everyday parlance, one often hears the statement, ?Life is not a bed of roses.? The writer would like to make his own alterations. ?Married life is not a bed of roses, for there are thorns underneath. It all depends on the turn you make! Another statement one often hears, in the case of successful marriages, is ?Marriages are made in Heaven?, implying that it is the Almighty who decides your ideal partner, whom you marry. ?
The Good Book says, ?Two are better than one; for if one falls, the other would hold?. While this refers to Platonic friendship, it applies to marriage as well. Once you get married (to the right partner), you would realise that whatever problems you have, there is someone to fall back and give you moral support and sometimes physical support. ??
There are other quotations about marriage itself. The one mentioned by the priest, the late Rev.K.J. Mills, at the writer?s wedding is classic.?
?
?

VK Sasikala convicted in corruption case
	
The Supreme Court has held VK Sasikala, AIADMK chief, guilty of helping former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa amass illicit wealth worth over 60 crores in the 1990s and has convicted her.
Ms Sasikala will have to surrender immediately and will send to jail. This puts an end to her claim to be Tamil Nadu's next chief minister - she cannot hold public office or contest elections for the period of her jail term and six years after that.
Ahead of the Supreme Court verdict, Ms Sasikala, 61, spent the night at the five-star Golden Bay Resort resort in Mahabalipuram, 80 km from Chennai, along with about 120 legislators whom she has sequestered for almost a week.
Ms Sasikala's claim to the Chief Minister's post was challenged by interim Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, who took charge of the state after J Jayalalithaa died in December.
He could now be invited by the state's Governor to prove he has majority support in the assembly.
Mr Panneerselvam had alleged that Ms Sasikala has held MLAs "captive" at the resort and that they will vote for him if "set free and allowed to decide."
Nine legislators including a minister have joined Team Panneerselvam over the last few days, two of them since last night.
Both Ms Sasikala and Mr Panneerselvam met Tamil Nadu Governor C Vidyasagar Rao last week and presented their claim to take a trust vote ahead of the other.? He was reportedly waiting for the Supreme Court verdict in the corruption case.
A trial court had convicted Ms Jayalalithaa and VK Sasikala and sentenced them each to four years in jail.
Both spent a few months in jail before the Karnataka High Court overturned the trial court order acquitting them.
The Karnataka government had appealed against the acquittal and the top court had reserved verdict in June last year.(NDTV)

What is a Cervical Cancer & What Are the Symptoms?
	
?
Cancer is a disease condition in which the cells of the body grow in an uncontrolled manner and becomes abnormal. When this growth is seen in the cervix, then it is calledas cervical cancer. Cervix is the neck of the womb/uterus or the narrow lower part of the womb. ?
?
What causes cervical cancer?
There are many risk factors for cervical cancer. The main cause of this cancer is a virus called the Human Pappiloma Virus (HPV). HPV almost always is the cause. There are many types of HPV viruses. Not all types cause the cancer. Specifically 2 types causes 70% or more of cervical cancer. This virus is transmitted from person to person by sexual intercourse; hence it?s a sexually transmitted virus.
In most, the virus just goes away or the body gets rid of it without any consequences or harm. But in a few it goes on to cause cancer in the cervix. Once the virus invades the cells, it could take up to 8-10 yrs for the cancer changes to occur. Some types are more dangerous than the others.
?
Who is at risk for cervical cancer?
HPV infection:
Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women age under the age of 45yrs. The women, who become sexually active from youngage or having multiple partners, are at high risk contracting the virus. Unprotected intercourse increases the risk of contracting the virus.99% of cases, cervical cancers are caused by persistent infections whiletransmitted through skin to skin contacts in the genital area
Sexually transmitted disease:
Presence of other sexually transmitted diseases like Chlamydia etc further increases the risk.?
Weakened immunity:
HIV and AIDS add more risk since it compresses the immunity. Also people, who are on immune suppressive drugs such as e.g. after transplant, also have a higher risk.
Smoking:
Women who smoke are found to have higher incidence of cervical cancer. Lining of the cervical cells are damaged by chemicals found in the smokehence increasing the chance of the virus invading the cells and changing them into cancerous cells.?
Pregnancy and child bearing:
There is some evidence to suggest that women who have children too early or having too many, are also linked with high risk factors. Especially women bearing kids before the age of 17years are at more risk than woman who has her first child after 25years. Also having more than 7 children have shown to increase the risk of developing cervical cancer than women who have never given birth.
Birth control/Contraceptive pill:
Use of certain pills for longer term (I.e. over 5 years) may increase in the chance of having cancerous cells. However, in contrast use of pills is known to be protective against ovarian and womb cancer.
Family:
There may be evidence to suggest that this cancer may also run in some families.?
Other risks:
Women from a deprived background are found to be more at risk.
Women who were exposed to a drug that was used in 1940?s called Diethylstilboestrol (DES) are at high risk as well. Certain other chemical exposures are also linked with cervical cancers as well.
?
What are the symptoms of cervical cancer?
Early stage of this cancer can be almost symptomless. Hence the cervical screening i.e.PAP test is a lifesaving screening tool and it is a must for women who are sexually active.?
Abnormal/unusual vaginal bleeding which can occur after sexual intercourse, in between periods or after the menopause is noted as a major symptom. Some women have unpleasant vaginal discharge or some discomfort with sexual intercourse. As one can appreciate that all those above mentioned symptoms are very non specific and there could be many other reasons for all the symptoms as well. So the importance of regular cervical screening is the utmost way of early detection.
?
How is cervical cancer diagnosed?
High level of suspicion is vital to diagnose this condition in our country since routine recall is not practiced well. Cervical smear or a PAP test is an effective tool used for the diagnosis of pre cancerous cells or even cancerous cells. Also cervical biopsies or colposcopies (a large microscopy that visualizes the cervix) are also used in the diagnosis. Even though it takes long time i.e. up to 10years or more for the cancer changes to occur in these cervical cells, they can still be detected at the precancerous stage if cervical smears are done routinely. In one study it was noted that up to 850-950 women are admitted every year to government hospitals in our country with advanced disease due to the lack of screening.
?
How is cervical cancer treated?
First of all once the precancerous cells are identified, they are removed or destroyed from the body to prevent them from further changing into cancer cells. They are simply shaved off from the top of the cervix or womb is removed. These cells are destroyed using Cryotherapy (freezing) or destroyed with laser or current.?
Treatment for cervical cancer depends on the stage of the cancer. The size and the depth of invasion dictate the treatment methods. In early stages it could be effectively dealt with surgery.Depending on the severity of the disease, treatment optionsdiffer: surgery, chemotherapy (drugs given to destroy the cancer cells), radiotherapy or combinations. If it?s incurable palliative therapy is given to relieve symptoms and make the patient comfortable.
?
Who should get Pap tests and how often?
Different countries have different age for starting the screening. Most have a routine recall as well. But in our country it is not so common practice thought it is important as discussed earlier.?
In most countries screening begins at the age of 25years, since cervical cancer is rarely seen below the age of 25years. Ideally once a woman becomes sexually active smear test becomes an essential. Recommendations are to carry on screening every three years till the age of 49. From the age of 50 to 64 five yearly screening is recommended. After 65 it?s only needed if screening was never performed or the woman had an abnormal smear in the recent past.
?
What is the chance of recovery from cervical cancer?
This again solely depends on the stage of the disease. Very early detection of the disease with timely treatment may result in 95% survivingfor 5yrs or more. In advanced stage the survival rate drops drastically down to 5%.?
?
What can a woman do to decrease her risk of getting cervical cancer?
Be proactive and find pre cancer cells by attending regular smear tests. Detecting pre cancer cells early prevents cancer itself.
	One may find protection from HPV by using protection methods such as condoms and avoid exposure to the virus.?
	Stop smoking
	Getting HPV vaccine - Teenage boys and girls should be encouraged to get vaccinated.
	Having sex intercourse with circumcised men is said to reduce the risk comparatively since circumcised men are less likely to carry HPV. ?
