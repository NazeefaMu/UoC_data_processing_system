AIA takes to Negombo skies
	
The skies of Negombo ignited with energy as swarms of red AIA kites soared across the town, at the recently held AIA-in-town programme.
The city, renowned for sand, sea and sails, was the seventh town visited by AIA for a 5 day programme of creating regional presence whilst engaging and connecting with its people.
Amidst the business seminars and educational workshops, there was a host of fun-filled activities for children and adults alike. Most importantly all the activities focused on encouraging people to be wise and plan ahead about their futures, be it planning for retirement, the rising cost of education and health services or most importantly, the unforeseen loss of a breadwinner for the dependants. 
Many visitors to AIAs event realised there was a wide gap between what they will most likely have and the amount they will actually need. AIA is on 2310310 and has a host of solutions that can help, should you feel the same way.

Meanwhile the Department of Irrigation said water levels in most of the reservoirs were 25 per cent to 40 per cent of the total capacities. We will have to manage the supply of water for the cultivation and for the drinking water purposes. There would not be an issue if the showers come down as predicted, a spokesman from the Irrigation Department said.
As many as 519, 527 families belonging to 138, 585 families in 16 districts were affected with the drought. The affected Districts are Kalutara, Gampaha, Kandy, Matale, Moneragala, Kegalle, Ratnapura, Mullaithivu, Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Anuradhapura, Ampara, Batticaloa and Trincomalee.(Yohan Perera)

Colombia's President Santos donates Nobel money to conflict victims
	
Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has said he will donate the money from the Nobel Peace prize to help the victims of the 52-year conflict in his country.
He was awarded the prize for reaching a peace agreement with the Farc rebel group last month.
The deal was rejected a few days later by Colombian voters in a referendum.
About 260,000 people have been killed and more than six million internally displaced in Colombia.
"Last night, I met with my family and we have decided to donate those eight million Swedish krona ($925,000) to the victims," said Mr Santos.
He made the announcement in the city of Bojaya, in the north-western region of Choco, after taking part religious ceremony for people affected by the conflict.
The head of the Nobel commitee said on Friday the award recognised the president's "resolute efforts" to end the conflict.
"The award should also be seen as a tribute to the Colombian people who, despite great hardships and abuses, have not given up hope of a just peace, and to all the parties who have contributed to the peace process," Kaci Kullman Five added.
Mr Santos said he dedicated the award to "all the victims of the conflict".
The award did not include the Farc (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) leader Timoleon Rodriguez, better known as Timochenko.
He also signed the accord after nearly four years of negotiations held by government and rebel delegates in the Cuban capital, Havana.(BBC)

ICRA reaffirms Dunamis Capital long-term ratings
	
ICRA Lanka Limited, a subsidiary of ICRA Limited, a group company of Moodys Investors Service, has reaffirmed the issuer rating of [SL]BBB+ with stable outlook for Dunamis Capital PLC (DCP).
ICRA Lanka has also reaffirmed the issue ratings of [SL]BBB+ with stable outlook for the two Rs.1 billion senior unsecured debenture programmes ofthe company.
ICRA Lanka has taken a consolidated view of DCP and its subsidiaries, with DCP being the holding company, for arriving at the ratings. The ratings factor in DCPs status as the parent company of First Capital Holdings PLC (FCH; issuer rating of [SL]A- with stable outlook). The rating takes note of the improvement in the business and financial performance of the real estate development subsidiary, Kelsey Developments PLC (Kelsey), which is likely to support the overall performance of the DCP group (DCP and its subsidiaries consolidated) to some extent.
Kelsey reported a net profit of Rs.54 million during FY2016 (Rs.32 million loss in FY2015), while the manufacturing subsidiary, Premier Synthetic Leather Manufacturers (Private) Limited (PRIMO) continued to report losses (Rs.132 million in FY 2016 as compared to Rs.110 million in FY2015). DCPs consolidated performance was impacted by FCH, which accounted for close to 53 percent of the total DCP consolidated income during FY2016 vis--vis 91 percent during FY2015.
FCHs performance in turn is largely dependent on the performance of First Capital Treasuries PLC (FCT; issuer rating of [SL]A- with stable outlook), as the contribution from the other FCH subsidiaries presently is quite modest. FCT accounted for about 74 percent of the total consolidated asset base of FCH as on March 31, 2016. Thus, DCPs overall performance is expected to remain susceptible to the risks inherent in FCT till the other subsidiaries (including subsidiaries of FCH) scale up and improve their contribution to the group.
Further, ICRA Lanka takes note of the recent high gearing level of FCT and the impact it has on the consolidated gearing profile of DCP. The consolidated gearing of DCP increased to 28.9 times as on June 30, 2016 as compared to 18.3 times as on March 31, 2016. The same will be closely monitored by ICRA Lanka and would be a key rating sensitivity for DCP.
ICRA Lanka takes cognisance of the currently comfortable funding and liquidity position of the DCP group, given the limited dependence on group for funding its investment plans, especially in Kelsey. However, ICRA Lanka would closely monitor the extent of the proposed investments, and the impact on the overall liquidity and gearing profile of DCP.

Mentally-ill asylum seeker posed as suicide bomber at Lime Street
	
An asylum seeker alleged to be a Tamil Tiger spy posed as a suicide bomber at Lime Street station after learning he was being deported.
Mentally-ill Sureshkumar Thurairajah, 44, wore a bulging anorak zipped up to his neck and a baseball cap covering part of his face.
When asked if he had a ticket at the underground stations barriers he told Merseyrail worker David Evans: I want to suicide bomb the train.
Liverpool Crown Court heard the Sri Lankan earlier suffered a breakdown after collapsing and being taken to hospital when told of his failed asylum bid.
Judge Anil Murray said: In the present climate where bombs are used to cause terror the very threat to use a bomb, whether real or not, is likely to cause fear and panic.
Thankfully Mr Evans remained calm. He told you that you couldnt get on the platform without a ticket, then contacted police who approached, searched you and there was in fact no bomb.
Thurairajah was arrested at the station by British Transport Police at around 3.20pm on April 1 this year.
Gareth Roberts, prosecuting, said Thurairajah told officers he wanted to throw himself in front of a train.
He later explained he heard voices in his head and wanted to kill himself and was taken to hospital for treatment.
Thurairajah, of Kingsmills Road, Wrexham, who has no previous convictions, admitted communicating false information.
He later tried to vacate his guilty plea, but the application was rejected after a two-day hearing.
Eric Lamb, defending, said his client left Sri Lanka where he was accused of being part of the Tamil Tigers terrorist group.
He said: He is subject to a warrant in Sri Lanka where he had been suspected of spying for the Tamil Tigers.
The defendant makes clear to me that is a false accusation but it is certainly a matter that looms very large in the defendants thoughts and his situation.
A doctors report revealed Thurairajah witnessed terrible events in Sri Lanka and was diagnosed as suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
Despite numerous suicide attempts, the doctor did not believe he required hospital treatment and could be treated in the community.
Mr Lamb said eight supporters in the public gallery confirmed Thurairajah was well-regarded thanks to his voluntary work.
He urged the judge to impose a sentence of less than 12 months, as he intends to appeal against his deportation, which is automatic if jailed for a year or more.
Mr Lamb said: This was an unhappy exception to the defendants otherwise good conduct and there were plainly extreme pressures upon him at the time.
The court heard he had previously been hospitalised in March after telling police he wanted to die.
Mr Lamb said: When detained by the police he said he was a terrorist and had links with al-Qaeda.
Judge Murray accepted Thurairajah had mental health problems and received bad news about his immigration status, which made him agitated.
He said supporters described him as kind-hearted, helpful and community-spirited and he had received a Community Action award.
The judge said: Its clear you have made a positive contribution to the community you live in.
Judge Murray handed Thurairajah 10 months in prison, prompting him to clasp his hands in prayer and say: Thank you  God bless you.

New ACCA Chairman outlines plans for enhancing profession in country
	
Adrian Perera, the newly elected Chairman Member Network panel of ACCA Sri Lanka, believes that to develop and prosper, every country needs the core skills of professional accountants to build transparency and accountability for strong, sustainable government, companies and societies.
Accountants need to have ethical standards and competencies, ask the right questions and know how to put the information together. This is where ACCA comes in to assist this process for both private and public enterprises through our qualifications that are aligned to meet these criterias. Therefore to me this is an exciting time to lead ACCA as we try to achieve our vision of being number one in developing professional accountants the world needs.
He identified three challenges for todays organizations: people, process and pace of change.
In terms of people, it is about having the right people with the right skills,whereas for processes it is where, companies must get to grips with the changing technological landscape and be able to align the finance function in a manner that will be beneficial
to organizations.
As for the pace of change, Adrian feels that it is important for accountants and finance professionals to play a bigger role in facilitating change within an organization, and to apply the essential principles of entrepreneurship. I see accountants in the future playing the role as trusted advisers for businesses. We as practitioners need to be at the forefront of changes and developments and be aware of whats happening in the economy and business landscape so that we are able to advise our organizations to help them navigate issues and challenges and manage them,
he says.
Hence at ACCA, we are working to make sure the qualification remains fit for thispurpose. We will be organizing as we have done in the past a series of workshops that are relevant to the challenges that are facing businesses today such as Cyber security, International Taxation and many more so that our members are updated and knowlegable of the current trends and challenges that businesses face.
He also points out that developing professional accountants the world needs is pivotal. This means inspiring the younger generation to take up accountancy. Nowadays one is spoilt for choice and if people dont come forward to take up accountancy then there will be a shortage of talent. Thats why we intend to continue our quest in building and strengthening our relationships with schools and universities across the country to promote ACCA and to make them understand the value they can derive from the qualification and the role they can play in uplifting the industry in the country and the businesses.
He also cited that working alongside with other accountancy bodies to enhance the profession in the country was crucial.  ACCA will continue to foster the relationships that we have with themany professional bodies in the country and will look at building new relationships with other professions as well ,such as HR so that will give added value to the businesses inour country.
Another thing we are trying to expand is the footprint that we have in the public sector in the sense of promoting  good governance, ethics, and risk management. Looking ahead, Adrian says that ACCA is seeking to build stronger understanding and relationships between the accountancy profession and interest groups such as legislators, regulators and investors along with the business community.

Water supply only for 18 hrs a day
	
The 24 hour water supply will be curtailed to 18 hours a day in the near future, due to the adverse drought conditions prevalent in the country, National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) Chairman K.A. Ansar said.
Ansar said they looked forward to public support to collect water for those affected by the drought while conserving remaining water resources.
We will be at risk if we supply water in a continuous manner during such weather, Ansar said. (Jayantha Samarakon)
