Central Expressway;Govt to look for local construction firms
	
		 		 
		 
			
In a major policy decision, the Government has decided to implement the Central Expressway Project (CEP) with inputs from local construction firms, joint ventures or consortiums.?
In line with the new policy, Section 3 of the CEP from Pothuhera to Galagedara via Rambukkana which is 32.5km in length will be divided into five contract packages and handed over to local constructors for completion within 36 months.
Each package will have an estimated cost and distance of 4.5 to 7.5km. A Cabinet memorandum presented by Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella states that the Road Development Authority (RDA) expected to select suitable local construction firms thorough a tender procedure.
?To construct the road, construction firms should obtain the necessary funds from local or international banks in Sri Lanka, with the loans to be paid back by the Government in 15 years with a grace period of three years on rupee terms,? he stated in his memo.
The selected consultancy firm should obtain a loan from local or international banks in Sri Lanka to cover consultancy fees which would be repaid by the Government within 15 years with a three-year grace period. The bid value is between Rs.5 billion and Rs.20 billion and those bidding must be experienced in the construction of highways/bridges with a minimum combined value of Rs.2 billion within the past 15 years.
The Treasury will appoint a Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (CAPC) and Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) for the purpose of evaluating the prequalifications and technical and financial proposals submitted by the construction firms.
The CEP was initiated by the Mahinda Rajapaksa administration with funds from China.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

<U+200B>Jaya seeks Modi's help on Indian fishermen in SL custody
	
		 		 
		 
			
Chief minister J Jayalalithaa on Friday sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to secure the release of 41 Tamil Nadu fishermen, who have been in Sri Lankan custody over the past several weeks, and 56 fishing boats.
In the latest incident, four fishermen who set sail from Jegathapattinam fishing base in Pudukkottai district on a mechanised boat were apprehended by the Sri Lankan navy on Thursday morning. They were taken to Kankesanthurai in Sri Lanka.
"It is very unfortunate that the Sri Lankan authorities are persisting with their aggressive and offensive approach of apprehending Indian fishermen and infringing upon their traditional right to pursue their peaceful livelihood of fishing in the Palk Bay," Jayalalithaa said in a letter to Modi.
Jayalalithaa said the Centre should act decisively in the light of the sensitive nature of the issue and initiate a calibrated set of actions to end the sufferings of the Indian fishermen.
"The continued incarceration of our fishermen and impounding of their boats in Sri Lanka just as the festive season is beginning is causing great frustration and despondency among the fisherfolk in Tamil Nadu," the chief minister said, requesting Modi to direct external affairs ministry to take up the matter strongly with the Sri Lankan authorities.(Times of India)
