Buddhist monk assaulted at anti-Rajapaksa protest in Malaysia
	
The chief monk of the Sri Lankan Buddhist temple in Sentul, Malaysia was assaulted by a small group among demonstrators conducting a protest against former Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa who is visiting Malaysia, 'Free Malaysia Today' reported.
?
The group of about 50 people had gathered in front of Putra World Trade Centre to protest against Rajapaksa?s attendance at an international conference of Asian political parties.
?
The protesters went to the Sentul temple when rumours of Rajapaksa?s supposed visit began to spread.
The group comprised members of the Malaysian Indian Progressive Association, Malaysian Tamilan, and the Malaysian Indian Education Transformation Association (MIETA). They began to burn an effigy of Rajapaksa in front of the temple.
When the chief monk Sri Saranan came out of the temple, some unknown individuals went to question him about Rajapaksa?s arrival. They then abused him with vulgarities and obscenities.
The assault began after one person touched the monk?s face, prompting another to punch Sri Saranan in the face. Two members of the crowd also kicked the monk, forcing Sri Saranan to retreat inside the temple.
Sentul police prevented the crowd from further attacking the monk, and MIETA chairman A. Elangovan entered the temple together with the police to apologise to the monk.
Elangovan agreed it was wrong to assault anyone at a protest and said he did not know who the attackers were. Several people had just joined the crowd to protest. ?They are a bit emotional. But still, we can?t beat them up because this is a religious place.?
He said he had agreed with the chief monk that no one should be restricted from coming into a temple. ?This is a religious place. We have no right to dictate who should come here and not.?
He said that if Rajapaksa came to the temple ?to seek forgiveness from God, then it is fine. We have no say in who should come and not?.
When asked if his group would turn up tomorrow, Elangovan said they would only carry out a protest if Rajapaksa made an appearance. ?We do not want to destroy the sanctity of a holy place?.
Police later told reporters that members of the Light Strike Force and some officers might be stationed at the temple to ensure peace as certain people might turn up with sticks and stones. (Free Malaysia Today)

Forensic laboratory to be established for SL Police
	
A new forensic laboratory would be established within this year for the use of the Sri Lanka Police to help sleuths to analyze evidence during their investigations, DIG Priyantha Jayakody said last week.
This move coincides with the 150th Anniversary celebrations of the Sri Lanka Police.
DIG Jayakody said the setting up of a forensic laboratory was an idea mooted by IGP Pujith Jayasundara, who encouraged his officers to utilize the latest technology in police investigations to ensure accuracy in their findings.
Accordingly, when the new laboratory is established, the police would have facilities such as obtaining latent impressions, DNA, serology, digital evidence, and the ability to obtain, trace and analyze substances and examine biological samples at their disposal to be used in criminal investigations.
