'100-day' prepared by those supported Maithri, not only UNP: Harin
	
The 100-day programme was not a part of the UNP manifesto but a policy document which was prepared and marketed by those who supported the common candidate Maithripala Sirisena for the presidency, UNP Spokesman and Publicity Unit Chief Harin Fernando said today.
?The 100-day programme slogan which we marketed at that time was ?Maithri palanayak dina seeyakin aluth ratak' (A Maithri administration and a new country in 100 days). This was a creation of all political parties and civil society groups which rallied round the common candidate for the 2015 presidential election,? he told a media conference.
This is the first official statement made by the UNP after the President publicly criticized the 100-day programme last week.
Mr. Fernando said January 8, 2015 was the day on which a silent revolution toppled the then government.
?It was not the UNP which decided to field a common candidate and neither was it the only party that wanted to end the previous regime in 2015. This was a decision arrived at by all those who opposed the then regime. However, the UNP also endorsed the fielding of a common candidate at the presidential election,? he said.
?It is also true that people endorsed the common candidate, the then SLFP General Secretary Maithripala Sirisena. People trusted him more because of the 100-day programme. We were not able to fulfill some of the pledges we made under this programme because some of those who supported former president Mahinda Rajapaksa sabotaged it. However, we fulfilled a several of the promises. This includes national pharmaceutical policy, the 19th Amendment and the Right to Information Bill,??he said. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: Eastern Development and Co-existence

Eastern Development and Co-existence
	
?
In this column, my articles have drawn attention to the failure of reconstruction and the escalating problem of indebtedness in the post-war North. My understanding of the economy of the East is limited to insights gained through periodic visits, which suggest that the dynamics of the economy may be quite different. Given my limited engagement in the East, my comments here are tentative.? ?
The message from a cross section of people from the District Secretariats, co-operatives, women?s groups, NGOs and academia from Batticaloa, Amparai and Trincomalee, where I spent some time recently, is that the economic situation in the East is dire. Driving along the beautiful lagoons, lush green paddy fields, pastures, and fishing villages of the Eastern Province, however, it is hard to understand why such a resource rich region has such high levels of poverty.? ?
The political economy of the East may be understood in relation to its troubled history. The East has been subject to many narrow political agendas. Its Tamil population was dominated by the Jaffna Tamils in academia, administration and politics. Successive governments in Colombo manipulated the East to strengthen their political base, leading to gerrymandering and the carving out of ethnic enclaves. The LTTE and its violence against the Muslim community, as well as counter violence with state backing, have left deep ethnic fissures that continue to this day. More recently, the East has been sadly neglected in post-war development efforts.? ?
Paddy, milk and fish
As with much of rural Sri Lanka, the major sectors in the East are agriculture, livestock and fisheries. The Eastern Province is a major producer of paddy in the country, only matched by the North Central Province. According to Economic and Social Statistics of Sri Lanka 2017, annually, the East produces close to a quarter of total national paddy production. In 2016, out of a total of 4.4 million metric tons of paddy produced in the country, the East accounted for 1.1 million MT. However, only a minuscule amount of that paddy can be stored in the East, which means farmers cannot get a higher price by selling the paddy a few months after harvest. Furthermore, there are hardly any rice mills to create additional employment and increase incomes.? ?
?
"Paduvankarai area is consisting of six Divisional Secretariat areas is subject to mass displacement and resettlement ? is one such region with a very high incidence of poverty"
Similarly, with respect to milk production, over a fifth of the cows in the country are in the Eastern Province totalling to 200,000 cows out of a national total of 945,000. However, when it comes to average daily milk production, only a mere 92,000 litres or approximately 10% of the total daily milk production in the country of 883,000 litres comes from the East. Worse, there is very little value addition in terms of milk processing in the Eastern Province, as the milk is mainly collected and sent for processing in other regions. Thus investment in the dairy sector, both to increase yields and for processing into various dairy products is a critical need. The same is true of fisheries, where almost a fifth of fish production comes from the Eastern Province, but officials claim the fishing communities have not advanced much and incomes remain low for fishing households.? ?
These rural sectors have historically been neglected by policymakers all over Sri Lanka, but the situation in the East, relative to other provinces, is worse. Clearly, a region that produces such large quantities of rice, milk and fish should not have such high levels of poverty and malnutrition.? ?
Prevalence of poverty and indebtedness
The poverty headcount in the Eastern Province is a worrying 7.3%, and only second to the Northern Province with 7.7%. Notably, in Batticaloa and Trincomalee, the poverty head count is in the double digits at 11.3% and 10.0%, respectively (Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2016). While absolute poverty levels are high,according to some officials, there are pockets of resettled and other peripheral regions in Batticaloa, Amparai and Trincomalee, where estimated poverty headcount levels are possibly as high as 45%.? ?
The Paduvankarai area of Batticaloa, which is the western part of the lagoon consisting of six Divisional Secretariat areas ? formerly controlled by the LTTE and subject to mass displacement and resettlement ? is one such region with a very high incidence of poverty. The numbers of children out of school and levels of malnutrition are known to be highest in the region. The war having ended in the East in 2007, the plight of the residents of areas like Paduvankarai is, for the most part, forgotten in development efforts. Research as well development initiatives to uplift the socio-economic situation of formerly displaced and resettled communities is urgently needed.? ?
?
	It?s hard to understand why such a resource-rich region? has such high levels of poverty
	
	
	Rural sectors were historically neglected by policy makers all over Sri Lanka
	
	
	Poverty headcount in the East is 7.3%; only second to the North? with 7.7%? ?
	
?
The Eastern Province, and particularly rural Batticaloa, is caught in a crisis of indebtedness. Predatory micro-finance schemes charging massive interest rates have resulted in the out migration of women to work in the gulf countries and even families selling their houses to repay loans. According to women?s groups in the East, the rates of suicide and attempted suicide are on the rise. Even the Muslim community that normally avoids interest bearing loans considered to be usury, has seen more desperate households get entrapped in micro-finance schemes. Poverty and indebtedness seem to go hand in hand, with exploitative micro-finance companies targeting the poor to exploit what
little they own.? ?
Inclusive development and co-existence
The Eastern Provincial Council, unlike the Northern Provincial Council, has shown a keen interest in development over the last decade. However, resources for such development have been meagre. Furthermore, partisan politics in the Eastern Province has created fissures between communities, undermining broader development of the region, as political actors cater to their narrow political bases.? ?
In the post-war years, the Central Government and international donor agencies have neglected rural development in the Eastern Province. In the national budget for 2018, for example, there is sizeable investment for rural development in the North, but there is little for the East. Given the dire economic situation in the East, greater resources towards programs of rural rejuvenation, and sectors such as agriculture, livestock and fisheries,are a major need.? ?
?
"The rural Batticaloa, is caught in a crisis of indebtedness. Predatory micro-finance schemes charging massive interest rates drove women to seek employment in the gulf countries"
A shrinking economic pie is also a site for dangerous opportunistic forces seeking to create ethnic animosity. The recent spurt of anti-Muslim violence originated in Amparai, before it spread to Kandy, and created a climate of fear for the Muslim community all over the country. In a predominantly Hindu school in Trincomalee, moves to restrict Muslim female teachers wearing the Abhaya led to virulent ethno-religious rhetoric spreading across the country and undermining Muslim-Tamil relations.? ?
Politically, there is perhaps no province that is as important when it comes to transforming inter-ethnic relations in the country as it is the only province with more or less equal proportions of Muslims, Tamils and Sinhalese. The ethnic, religious and linguistic diversity in the East are also its strengths; the educated younger generations are bilingual or tri-lingual, and have the potential to work in other parts of the country. Economic development alone is not a precondition for rebuilding inter-ethnic relations. However, equitable development initiatives along with social mobilisation can contribute towards co-existence. If the East can succeed with meaningful and inclusive development, then it may set a path of pluralism for the rest of the country.?

?
Silk Road is the road that Chinese in the past used to trade with outside world. Ancient Silk Road comprised of land routes and sea routes. It has a history of more than 2,000 years. Chinese merchandise was sent to Central Asia, Middle East and African countries and Europe through these routes.
During the old days, Chinese caravans carried goods, such as tea and silk to ancient trading centres in Central Asia, where they were exchanged with foreign counterparts for spices, furs and other products.
The main objective of this article is to expound the expansion of train service between China and Europe under the new Silk Road project. Part of the Belt and Road Initiative, the rail network to Europe is expanding through these main routes.
The third one is central route that runs through Ereenhot Port in Inner Mongolia
autonomous region. ?
The Chinese manufactured computers, smartphones, textile, home appliances, etc. are exported to Europe through these land routes. If these products are shipped it would take 30 days to reach Europe but if they are sent by train, European markets could be reached within 14 days.

Gay Pride in SL: A moment to accept, acknowledge and CELEBRATE LGBTIQ LIVES
	
As the month of June approaches, countries all over the world, be it conservative or liberal, celebrate the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, now celebrated as Gay PRIDE or LGBT PRIDE worldwide. The Stonewall riots (referred to sometimes as the Stonewall uprising or the Stonewall rebellion) were a series of unprompted, sometimes violent demonstrations by members of the (LGBT) community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village in New York City. These riots were considered to be the most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States.? ?
Throughout Pride month, and in our daily lives, the LGBTIQ community is reminded that in Sri Lanka, one cannot enjoy Pride as most countries do. There are no large Pride marches on the streets of Colombo. Instead, Pride in Sri Lanka carefully celebrates our lives and who we are by holding a series of events that draw attention to the natural complexities and simplicity of LGBTIQ lives in this country. Draconian laws still remain in Sri Lanka and homosexuality is still illegal causing much damage to our society gay and straight alike. I say this, because a society that is divided, a society that is filled with hate and jealousy is a dysfunctional society that is only bound to self-destruct if sanity does not prevail. ?
?
"Draconian laws still remain in Sri Lanka and homosexuality is still illegal causing much damage to our society gay and straight alike"
Lack of government protection, let alone acknowledgement means that we would rather remain decades behind the rest of the world, than commit to values of equality and respect of all of our citizens. Progress is not about the many mega buildings we are currently putting up in this country. Nor does it mean the many new highways, ports, airports, and so on that are being built at a dizzying speed. Progress must mean, that we commit to respecting and protecting the rights of all our citizens. This also means cultivating an understanding of the struggles of marginalized groups like the LGBTIQ community. Throughout history, there has been a complete disregard for the services rendered to society by the LGBTIQ community including in the military, in government, in sports, in the arts and in all walks of life. LGBTIQ politicians hide their sexuality in the hopes that it won?t be held against them in an election. LGBTIQ persons in the military hide their status or face a court martial and a dishonourable discharge. LGBTIQ sportsmen and women hide their sexuality to enable them to be picked to represent our country.? ?
?
	As a nation, we must strive to stand up for each other?s rights
	
	
	Services rendered by LGBTIQ community at large were forgotten
	
Why is hiding, such a huge part of our lives? Why is hiding who we are, the expected norm in this country for those like us? The enormous effort it takes to always stay one step ahead of being outed, being made to feel shame and fearful of how hard our lives would end up being if we were to be out and proud, takes a huge toll on one?s physical, mental and emotional self. Forced into heterosexual marriages by parents so ashamed of their children they would do anything to redeem themselves by forcing a life of misery on their child. All we are taught growing up is that being LGBTIQ is a sickness, a perversion. Something that must be hidden from others.
Thanks to old Victorian values brought in by the British along with their insidious laws, we have become a nation of prudes and hypocrites, embracing what is not ours and shunning what is naturally ours from the dawn of time! ?
Those in power have the ability to shape societal values and public opinions and foster an accepting and tolerant attitude towards discriminated groups. This can be done by pushing for equal rights that do not leave out certain individuals and groups, and by acknowledging the value and services given by the LGBTIQ community that adds to our development as a progressive society. As a nation, we must strive to stand up for each other?s rights and understand that to become a progressive country, we need to be united in our efforts. One does not need to belong in the LGBTIQ community to support equality, but one must simply believe in an individual?s rights to freedom from discrimination and harassment and basic human rights. When the leadership of a country does not do enough to help its? vulnerable citizens, we must all step up to the plate and make our voices heard. We must make sure that the rights of the people are enshrined and protected, no matter who, no matter what. As citizens we mustn?t ignore the plight of minorities. To do so is to encourage widespread discrimination and violence. ?
Join us for Colombo PRIDE 2018 - a celebration of Diversity with Pride.

India, Pakistan clash on Kashmir border ends brief truce
	
?
DAILY MAIL, 03rd JUNE, 2018-India and Pakistan exchanged fire across the Kashmir border on Sunday, officials said, killing two guards and ending a days-old agreement to honour a ceasefire in the disputed region.
Seven civilians were also injured at Aknoor, near the contested territory?s border with Pakistan, in a barrage that claimed the lives of two Indian border officers.
India?s Border Security Force said its troops returned fire after Pakistani border rangers in Sialkot fired into Kashmir without provocation in the early hours of Sunday.
?The injured soldiers were immediately evacuated to a military hospital where they later succumbed (to their injuries),? border force spokesman Manoj Yadav told AFP from Jammu, the winter capital of the restive Himalayan region.
Pakistan authorities did not immediately comment on India?s allegations or whether any damage was sustained on their side of the border.
The salvo of gun and mortar fire came just four days after Pakistan and India promised to end ceasefire violations in Kashmir. The two sides had pledged to respect the conditions laid out in a 2003 ceasefire ?in letter and spirit? following some of the highest levels of violence in Kashmir since the pact was signed. Both sides blame each other for violating the 15-year ceasefire.
Dozens have been killed in border clashes in recent months along the border that divides the territory into zones of Indian and Pakistani control, leaving residents terrified.
The renewed commitment to the ceasefire had encouraged thousands of civilians to return to their homes after weeks of shelling.

Legal avenue to exploitative Microfinance in Sri Lanka
	
	Until 1990, the legal interest rate was governed by the Civil Law Ordinance
	
	
	Default or penalty interest rates are similarly considered to be interest agreed to between the parties
	
	
	Unregulated and exorbitant interest rates have attracted many finance companies to enter microfinance market
	
?
Microfinance provides a gateway for financial institutions to reach and exploit the earnings of poorer sections of society by charging high interest rates. The unregulated and exorbitant interest rates have attracted many finance companies to enter the microfinance market. The microfinance industry has trapped people into debt and even led to suicides.
Changes to legal principles and laws governing the financial sector have enabled such an expansion of microfinance, providing financial institutions with unfettered powers while offering very little recourse to those who have been affected by their actions. While unfair interest rates are charged from the people, the laws of interest are partial towards the powerful financial institutions. Therefore, there is an urgent need to review such laws.
Barriers on interest
Interest, to describe it simply, is a sum paid for the use of borrowed money by debtor to the creditor. Our laws pertaining to the charging of interest are governed by a series of Acts introduced during the colonial period and subsequently after 1990.
The law enforced in the colonial period with respect to interests was clearly based on English justice concepts. The concept ?no interest shall be recoverable to an amount in excess of the sum then due as principal? was an important principle in charging interest. This was introduced by the Civil Law Ordinance No.5 of 1852.
The same principle was affirmed and brought into practice by the Money Lending Ordinance in 1918. The Money Lending Ordinance also prohibited unfair interest rates and undue influence in making lending contracts. However, barrier on interest built in by English Law to protect the community was partially removed by the legislature by passing fourteen Acts in 1990. Significantly, the Debt Recovery Act No.2 of 1990 amended by Act No.9 of 1994 lifted the principle of ?no interest shall be recoverable to an amount in excess of the sum then due as principal?.
Simultaneously Act No.6 of 1990 (Amendment to Sec 192 of CPC) allowed the creditors to recover the aggregated interest from the date of action to the date of payment without any classification. In other words, the amendment allowed debtors to charge penalties in addition to imposing unfettered interest rates. In this way, barriers on exorbitant interest rates were removed, with the court deciding that the Civil Law Ordinance is not applicable for transactions. Such a move is contrary to the principles of Jurisprudence. Furthermore, the court neglected and avoided applying other principles based on justice pertaining to the interest such as unfair interest and undue influence introduced by the Money Lending Ordinance.
The implications of such changes to legal principles is that the interest charged can be ten times, hundred times or more of the principal amount. To understand the seriousness of these changes, a closer look at the classification of interest as practised in Sri Lanka is useful.
Classification of Interest
According to the Civil Law Ordinance two types of interest are applicable to transactions, namely the legal interest and interest agreed upon between the parties.
The legal interest was introduced to our law by the Civil Law Ordinance No.5 of 1852. The first introduced rate of the legal interest was 5%. Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance states as follows,
?Provided that no person shall be prevented from recovering on any contract or engagement any amount of interest expressly reserved thereby or from recovering interest at the rate of five percent per annum on any contract or engagement?
According to Section 5, when parties have not agreed upon the interest component in the contract, the creditor is legally entitled to recover 5% interest per year from the debtor. If the parties have agreed upon the interest, the creditor is entitled to recover the interest agreed upon in the contract. Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance was amended by act No.36 of 1981 and legal interest was increased up to 12%.
Until 1990, the legal interest rate was governed by the Civil Law Ordinance and the rate could only be changed by the Parliament. In 1990, the authority of determining the legal interest was given to the Monetary Board established under the Monetary Law Act.
Section 192 of the Civil Procedure code amended by Act No.6 of 1990 states that legal interest is applicable only where the parties have not agreed on interest rates in lending contracts. Conditions with respect to the interest are the most important terms in such contracts. Applicable interest rate is decided by the financial institution and included in the agreement. When such an agreement is present, the Central Bank / Monetary Board cannot control or influence the financial institution to implement the legal interest. The Civil Law Ordinance states that the parties are at liberty to make the contracts and can agree on any rate of interest by contract.
At the same time, Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance is very clear that the interest or arrears of interest which exceed the principal is not recoverable. It provides that:
?
"Our laws pertaining to the charging of interest are governed by a series of acts introduced during the colonial period and subsequently after 1990"
"Default or penalty interest rates are similarly considered to be interest agreed to between the parties. The debtor becomes liable to pay when he/she has defaulted or delayed payment on installments"
?in any case in which interest is payable by law and or different rate of the interest has been specially agreed upon between the parties, but the amount recoverable on account of interest or arrears of interest shall in no case exceed the principal.?
Section 5 of the Money Lending Ordinance of 1918 provides that the court should follow the principle of ?no interest shall be recoverable to an amount in excess of the sum then due as principal?. However, by the Debt Recovery Act No.2 of 1990 amended by Act No.9 of 1994, the legislature lifted the limit set out in Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance, applying to the cases filed under the Act.
The said provisions of the Debt Recovery Act were extended to all bank transactions by Justice Amarathunga in Nimalarathne Perera Vs The People?s Bank 2 SLR 67, by saying that the provisions of the Civil Law Ordinance are not applicable to bank transactions.
Amending Section 192 of the Civil Procedure Code by Act No.6 of 1990, the legislature passed that the creditor is entitled to recover the aggregated amount of interest from the date of action to the date of payment according to the agreed rate on the principal. That section does not refer to the provisions of the Civil Law Ordinance. The court is of the view that the provisions of the Civil Law Ordinance have no application to financial transactions, though the Civil Law Ordinance has not been repealed by the legislature. The law is so vague that nobody knows what the limits of the interest rates are, and thus is interpreted as absolutely limitless.
Default or penalty interest rates are similarly considered to be interest agreed to between the parties. The debtor becomes liable to pay when he/she has defaulted or delayed payment on installments. It is a penalty for default or delay of payment of debts. In practice, default interest rates agreed in contracts are excessively higher than normal interest. They include 4% to 8% default interest per month (48% to 96% per annum) in contracts. Sometimes the debtor becomes liable to 10 or 20 times of the principal amount because of penalty interest.
Microfinance Act
The recent Microfinance Act has to be considered together with applicable laws pertaining to interest. The Microfinance Act No.6 of 2016, legitimized the target market of banks and finance companies to go beyond the middle and upper classes. The so called lower classes were not considered creditworthy by financial institutions. Therefore, they escaped from the clutches of big capital induced debts. The Microfinance Act will contribute towards legally converting the poor into debtors.
Prior to the introduction of microfinance companies, a local credit system, mainly handled by women and co-operative societies, was in existence. No money from the capital markets directly flowed into the system and funds of the community circulated within themselves. While the middle-class was attracted to capital markets after the reforms in 1990, microcredit remained in the hands of women and rural folk.
The exploitative credit system including microfinance promoted by the Finance Companies should be stopped. And community strengthening forms of microcredit as with the co-operative credit system should be encouraged.

Odel brings an extensive range of Casio watches to its store in hand with Blink International
	
Sri Lanka?s premier fashion department store Odel recently announced the addition of Casio watches to its extensive collection of original branded watches. Odel is now an authorized retailer for Casio, and will provide a host of after-sales services via its partnership with Blink International, the authorised service partner for Casio watches in Sri Lanka.
Odel has long been known as a retailer that offers shoppers the luxury of choice. Over 250 Casio watches will be available at the store?s flagship store at Alexandra Place, forming a part of a watch collection that totals an impressive 650+ -the largest collection of watches at a retail fashion chain. These watches are duty-free, which makes them more affordable and on par with prices in markets such as Dubai or Singapore.?
Casio watches are masterfully crafted works of superior design and quality. Take, for example, the G-Shock GA 700, a highly resilient analog-digital watch with a bold new case silhouette featuring 3D dial and hands for a multi-dimensional, carved out of metal look. The new model launched in August 2017 improves reading and projects added toughness with a front button super illuminator LED light crafted in black and red. It is shock resistant and 200M water resilient-the perfect accompaniment on an island adventure or for active day to day wear.?
The Edifice EQB 500 is another watch that combines supreme wearability with the best of modern technology. Its Bluetooth Smart connectivity enables it to be the world?s first watch with smartphone link to the time in 300 cities and equipped with controls that enhance operability. The design is polished, with a keen-edged dial design in a tough, rugged metal case.?
Odel will also stock other Casio watches from collections including G-shock, Baby-G, Protrek, Edifice, Enticer and Youth. In particular, it will stock the G-Shock Premium MTG and GPW series with features such as automatic time setting and GPS services. Odel?s status as an authorized Casio retailer will allow it to provide a comprehensive range of after-sales services by working directly with the authorized Casio Service Center in Sri Lanka which has direct monitoring by Casio Japan. Blink International is fully equipped with the latest technology to handle any Casio watch repair within 72 hours or less, inclusive of the high-end MTG series.?
Blink International Director Muhammed Mansoor noted, ?The partnership with Odel is a great way to expand our reach, and better way to cater to the middle-income segment of the local watch market. Odel provides a great retail space and shopping experience, which makes it an excellent place to make an informed decision when buying a watch. We look forward to catering to watch enthusiasts in Sri Lanka with this partnership.?

Postal services continue without disruptions: Postmaster General
	
Postmaster-General Rohana Abeyratne today said that the two-day island-wide token strike launched by the Union of Post and Telecommunication Officers did not have any impact on daily postal operations throughout the country.
However, he said the Central Mail Exchange (CME) operations were disrupted to some extent but mail collection and distribution including the Express Mail Service (EMS) were carried out as usual with the help of a junior staff.
Mr. Abeyratne said that most of the outstation employees had reported for duty today.
?Therefore, we expect the striking employees will also report for duty tomorrow,? he said.
He also added that Sri Lanka Post will take every possible measures to minimise any public inconvenience.? ?
Accordingly, several mail trains were arrived empty as the supervisors who joined the strike action refuse to load mail bags into the carriages. ?
Mails collection and distribution were seen disrupted in many areas while several post offices were seen closed.
Most of the operations in Central Mail exchange were also seen disrupted causing severe delays in its operations.
While denying the Postmaster-General Rohana Abeyratne?s claims, Union General Secretary H.K.Kariyawasam said the first day of the strike was successful and so will be the second day tomorrow.
He said that the strike was launched successfully in 653 Post offices, 40 control offices with the participation over 80 per cent of the officers in the department.
The token strike launched on midnight Sunday over several demands including a demand to amend the 06/2006 government administration circular which oppressed over 26,000 employees.
Mr. Kariyawasam warned the authorities that it will resort to islandwide indefinite strike action if the authorities are not willing to resolve their demands. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Prez has power to disclose names of the 118: Gammanpila
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said today there was no legal barrier to disclose the names of the 118 individuals who had obtained funds from Arjuna Aloyisus and pointed out that President Maithripala Sirisena had the power to order their release.??
He claimed there was political pressure that prevented the names being released.
?A Presidential Commission does not possess the authority to give orders to the President. It makes recommendations. Hence, the President has the power to release the full report of the Presidential Commission on the controversial bond scam,? the MP said.? ?
?We can?t fathom as to why President's Secretary Austin Fernando sought the Attorney General?s opinion on releasing the full report when the President has the power on that,? Gammanpila added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Robbing a monk's slippers lost him what he had
	
A man, who had visited the Gampaha District Secretariat to get his father's gun license transferred to his name, had taken away a pair of slippers belonging to a Buddhist monk who was delivering a sermon?(bana) at the District Secretariat premises at the time, after getting irritated as he was forced to wait till the sermon concluded to get his work done.
The man had hidden the pair of slippers under his clothing and gone away in anger.
After the conclusion of the sermon, the staff of the District Secretariat had been faced with a dilemma as they were unable to find the monk's slippers. The authorities looked at the CCTV footage and saw an outsider leaving the premises with the slippers belonging to the monk who had come to deliver the?sermon.
When the man returned the following day to get his transfer done,?he was immediately recognised by the security at the DS office as the one who had taken away the monk's slippers and the police were informed about it.
He explained to police that the reason for his curious action was that he was?irritated about the delay in getting his work done by the DS staff.
After hearing the reason for him to fly off the handle the authorities were of the opinion that if such a minute thing had caused this individual to get angry and do what he did in retaliation, then what guarantee did they have that handing over a gun license to him would not have bad repercussions for others that got in his way.
As a result they refused his request to transfer the gun license to his name and instead requested the police to confiscate the weapon. (Thilakaratna Dissanayake)

SuttaCentral  gifts Buddhist  wisdom  to the world
	
A ceremony to mark the introduction of SuttaCentral.net to Sri Lanka was held on May 31 at the Nelum Pokuna with the blessings of the Maha Sangha and Ven. Ajahn Sujato.
Venerable Ajahn Sujato
?
?The world is afflicted by death and decay. But the wise do not grieve, having realized the nature of the world.? ? Gautama Buddha
Perhaps it is this knowledge that fuels the desire of more and more people across the world to seek the wisdom of Buddhism.
In fact, research conducted by the Pew Research Centre in 2015 revealed the number of Buddhists, around the world, is expected to increase from 488 million to about 511 million between 2010 and 2030.
The research points towards verity, that people across the world are more aware of and interested in Buddhism.
These developments are evidently the culmination of efforts by enthusiasts, who toil to impart the wisdom of the Buddha. Since its introduction to the island in the 3rd century BC, Buddhism has withstood turbulent times, including a struggle to revive the religion during the times of colonial endorsement of other religions.
Despite evidence to suggest Buddhist links between the ancient Greeks through the Middle Ages, it was the labour of Western scholars and philosophers that shed light on Buddhism in the West.
The Western world had little or no awareness about what unifying wisdom or spirituality linked countries stretching from Sri Lanka to China. Max M?ller, Alexander Cunningham, Eugene Burnouf, Rhys-Davids and Arthur Schopenhauer were some of the key figures who changed Western thinking and delved into oriental studies, which ultimately led to the search of Buddhist knowledge in the West.
?
"The objective of this website is to remove any obstruction or barrier of understanding the Buddha?s teachings. It is also freely available to anyone who seeks the wisdom of Buddhism, free of charge"
Along came figures such as the Irishman Laurence Carroll who was ordained in Burma as Venerable Dhammaloka and campaigned against the colonial powers on behalf of the Burmese. Henry Steel Olcott, a Buddhist modernist is revered for his labours in interpreting Buddhism through a Westernised lens and for leading the Buddhist revival in Ceylon.
Today Sri Lanka is set to be introduced to SuttaCentral, an online platform containing early Buddhist texts including a vast collection of teachings attributed to the Buddha and his earliest disciples. www.suttacentral.net contains the traditional texts known as the Thripitaka or ?Three Baskets?, which are regarded as sacred canon in all schools of Buddhism.
SuttaCentral hosts the texts in original languages ? especially Pali - as well as translations in 40 languages, including Sinhala.
Unique to SuttaCentral, however, are the comparisons and parallels, which illustrate the relationship between these collections, said the Public Liaison for SuttaCentral, Deepika Weerakoon.
?The objective of this website is to remove any obstruction or barrier of understanding the Buddha?s teachings. It is also freely available to anyone who seeks the wisdom of Buddhism, free of charge,? she added.
The principal founding member of this platform is Venerable Ajahn Sujato, hailing from Australia. Born Anthony Best, to a liberal Catholic family in Perth, he left a promising career as a musician after travelling to Thailand, where he discovered the forest tradition of Ven. Ajahn Chah.
It is commonly known in the West as the Thai Forest Tradition; a lineage of Theravada Buddhist monasticism. The tradition is distinguished from other Buddhist traditions by its doctrinal emphasis of the notion that the mind precedes the world.
Ven. Ajahn Sujato took higher ordination in 1994.? He spent his years in Thailand in monasteries and remote hermitages, where he learned in depth of the practices of loving-kindness or Metta. Upon his return to Australia, he not only founded the Santi Forest Monastery in New South Wales but also penned several guides including the ?A Swift Pair of Messengers? and ?A History of Mindfulness?.
One of his most important interests, however, is the development of SuttaCentral.net since its founding in 2004.? ?Ven. Ajahn Sujato invested almost 15 years on the development of SuttaCentral,? said Deepika.
?
"A new translation of the four Pali volumes or Nikayasis made available through SuttaCentral created under the guidance of Ven. Ajahn Sujato. Oral traditions of Buddhism were once recorded in ancient texts to preserve the teachings of Lord Buddha. Ven. Ajahn Sujato has converted these to the modern languages of our time to make the teachings of Buddhism more accessible."
His tireless efforts have brought together a team of international scholars to bring Lord Buddha?s teachings from diverse traditions under one platform, which can be accessed from anywhere in the world. ?This is not a Government funded effort. This project was funded by the people. It is heartening to know that people reach out to us in search of Dhamma as we have an average of 2,000 visitors to the site every day, from all over the world,? she added.
A ceremony to mark the introduction of SuttaCentral (www.suttacentral.net) to Sri Lanka was held on May 31 at the Nelum Pokuna in collaboration with the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress with the blessings of the Maha Sangha and Ven. Ajahn Sujato.
?The main purpose of this event is to promote to the Sri Lankan general public how to conveniently access and apply the teachings of the Buddha as a daily habit,? Deepika explained. The ceremony was marked by a chanting of the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, followed by a sermon by Ven.
Ajahn Sujato.

The translations emphasise on accuracy and clarity and make navigation easy with the clear and easy guidance.
It also gives us a way of reliably and consistently referencing the Pali text at a granular level, something that has never before been possible. With cutting-edge progressive web applications and technologies, the platform is ideal for anyone seeking to start a journey towards mindfulness.

Sysco LABS joins Educate Lanka Mentorship and Skills Development Program
	
Dhanusha Amarasinghe, Country Director, Educate Lanka Foundation speaking at Sysco LABS? inaugural Mentorship and Skills Development Program?
Sysco LABS has joined Educate Lanka on its Mentorship and Skills Development Program in an effort to support the next generation of Sri Lanka?s professionals. This student empowerment program is based on a unique social-private partnership model developed by the Educate Lanka Foundation. It leverages a network of corporate partners and their employees to develop the intellectual and professional capacities of the students who are supported financially through Educate Lanka?s micro-scholarships.?
Sysco LABS joined the mentorship program by pairing its staff members directly with students as they go through a 10-month structured peer-to-peer mentorship course covering a variety of topics ranging from educating yourself on career and tertiary education opportunities, to leadership skills, civics and workplace ethics. As part of the collaboration, Sysco LABS will also soon be conducting exposure and skills training sessions while offering internship and career placement opportunities for qualified Educate Lanka students and graduates.
Founded in 2007 with an initial aim of preventing students from dropping out before completing their education, Educate Lanka has evolved into a social enterprise driven by a vision of making opportunities universal for everyone and a mission of empowering the socioeconomically disadvantaged children and youth by enhancing their access to education, mentorship, and employment opportunities. In creating this impact, Educate Lanka employs long-term micro-scholarship funding and targeted exposure, guidance, and training to provide its students with key tools and opportunities necessary to transform themselves into motivated leaders and productive change-makers. It also instils positive attitudes and a sense of accountability. Students are also committed to contribute to Educate Lanka and their own communities through financial and voluntary means. To date, Educate Lanka has sponsored over 4,500 years of education of 1,200 students through nearly Rs. 70 million in micro-scholarships while over 500 of them have completed their higher education and gained employment. Educate Lanka is currently supporting 500 children and youth between the ages 13 and 25 from all nine provinces across the country.?
Sysco LABS Mentor Stefhan Sebastian, Associate Manager ? Marketing welcomes his Mentee Sampath Gangala, an undergraduate from University of Peradeniya
The Mentorship and Skills Development Program is an element of the support Educate Lanka provides to students that goes beyond its financial intervention. The organization looks to professionals from Sri Lanka?s leading industries as well as Educate Lanka alumni to mentor and train aspiring students on their personal and professional journeys. With Sysco LABS, there are a total of 18 corporate and institutional partners both locally and internationally that have directly impacted nearly 700 Educate Lanka students and students of its community partners through this program since its inception two years ago.?
In relation to the partnership, Manjula Dissanayake, Founder and President of Educate Lanka, said, ?Sysco LABS has been an instrumental partner of Educate Lanka since we first began to leverage the resources of the private sector and the business community in bridging the learning and leadership gaps of our students. As such, we are extremely thrilled and grateful to have their staff join us in providing our students with the 21st century skills, competencies, and exposure that will prepare them not only to meet the future talent need, but also to constructively tackle the challenges of tomorrow. Sri Lanka?s workforce and human capital will continue to be tested in a fast-changing world led by automation and artificial intelligence, and it?s imperative that we proactively and rapidly prepare our youth through innovative and collective approaches so that they could leapfrog into meeting the demands of future work and co-create an equitable and inclusive future for everyone.?
On joining the Program Sysco LABS? SVP and General Manager Rasika Karunatilake said, ?We are happy to be able to deepen our support for the Educate Lanka Foundation and connect our employees with the students in the program. It has been a deeply rewarding experience for our team and we would urge other organizations to join the program as well. Academics are vital, they are the foundation that a professional?s career is built on, but without synthesis with personal development, it?s hard to really develop a leader and a force for change. We know this to be true in our organization, and it is a privilege to be able to share it with the students.?

## Title: The Middle East in chaos and the Pivot to Asia - EDITORIAL

The Middle East in chaos and the Pivot to Asia - EDITORIAL
	
In the aftermath of World War II, the weakened colonial powers were forced by circumstances to give up physical control of their colonies. It was therefore necessary to devise new strategies to continue controlling the resources of these areas, as otherwise the resultant poverty in the imperial states would lead to discontent among its peoples leading to conflict, unrest and uprisings in those countries.? ?
The Middle East, awash with vast oil and petroleum resources has always been of tremendous importance to The US and its western allies whose skyscraper-based economies are totally dependent on petroleum products. Not surprisingly from the time it became clear that the Middle eastern countries would soon shed the shackles of imperialism and take control of their resources the US and the west actively formulated unrest and divisions in the region. The redrawing boundaries, the creation of new states like Kuwait and empowering puppet rulers whose hold on power depended on the west, ensured continuous unrest in the region.? ?
The carving out of the state of Israel in Palestine to resettle Jewish people -victims of European genocide- during World War II, took the turmoil in the region to a new high. Surrounded by people who differed from them in religion and angered by the robbery of their lands, the Jewish settlers were seen as enemies by both Palestinians and Arab states. The resultant fallout, has since been an ever enlarging source of conflict in the region. Sadly Israel is as much victim to the wiles of the west as the Palestinians, but has not understood it is being used as a mere cats paw by its western allies, who a year earlier, subjected Jewish people to genocide. ?
During the heady days of the ?Arab Spring? in 2011, western leaders led by the US, openly supported groups/organisations in the middle east ranging from Libya to Egypt to Syria and Tunisia who rose up against their governments. What began as small demonstrations suddenly took on the form of large-scale armed uprisings led by well-armed and trained militias. Yet whence came the arms and the training...? ?
The setting up of pro-west regimes in the middle eastern countries brought on its own backlash. The rise of terrorist organisations like the al-Queda and the Islamic State.
Today the Middle East or West Asia is in a region of complete bedlam. Today the US is transferring its focus on Asia. China has been rankled as the number one economic super power in the world by the IMF. Reports indicate it will maintain this lead in economic power rankings. Chinese military power is also on the ascendancy. The Global Fire Power (GFP) review ranks China 3rd out of 136 countries currently considered for the GFP review. China has also begun displacing decades-long American pre-eminence in most parts of Asia.? ?
And so, we are now seeing American attention ?Pivoting to Asia?.? ?
On May 31, US Admiral Harris, former head of US Pacific Command and next US Ambassador to South Korea said ?North Korea remains the most imminent threat to peace in the Pacific, but ?China?s dream of hegemony? is Washington?s biggest long-term challenge...?? ?
Sri Lanka, which western countries -- a few years ago -- vilified for ?so-called war crimes? is now suddenly being seen as a ?strategically important? and courted to join to join ?middle powers? and band together to manage China?s ascendancy! ?
We are being warned against possible ?future hegemony? and Chinese economic projects transforming into a ?neo-colonial experience?. Of a sudden, Sri Lanka is being welcomed to engage with a range of powers including the US, Japan and Australia. ?
In the ultimate loans are loans, and have to be repaid. What we do not want to see, is the chaos created in the Middle East replicated in Asia. Loans from the west come with a multitude of strings attached. As for example, scrapping of relief, raising of taxes, attempts to subjugate national sovereignty via amendments to the constitution to accommodate donor demands leading to domestic turmoil and bloodshed. Inability to repay Chinese loans lead to China taking possession of particular assets for a fixed time period.? ?
At the end of the period, the asset stays in the country together with the added value of improvements such as trade zones, markets etc.??

## Section: Press Releases

Thrive in the complex business world through mindful leadership
	
The question is no longer whether we will be disrupted, but how quickly can we adapt to constant disruption?
?
?Too many of the problems in societies stem from leadership that is ill prepared to deal with the chaos and complexity of today?s world where too much is happening too quickly?
-Jean Huston-
?
Four dominant forces are reshaping our organisations and societies in the 21st century and creating massive shifts in the way we work and lead: Globalization, digital technology, socially created information and a new demographic are forcing organisations and industries to rethink their strategies for succeeding in a complex, global world in which information is becoming a commodity and leadership can no longer be fully reliant on hierarchy.
?
Complexity increasingly defines the business landscape. It is the opposite of linearity and happens when unforeseeable factors converge together to create a situation that is not only unpredictable but immune to the traditional rules of decision making. It?s where command and control leadership just doesn?t work anymore.
?
Prof. Sudhanshu Palsule (Cambridge, Duke CE) explains complexity by the following characteristics:
?
1. Self-Organising - It consists of a number of diverse agents and each of those agents is making decisions on how to behave irrespective of organisations or individuals.
?
2. Adaptive - The diverse agents are continually interacting with each other, thereby becoming highly adaptive.
?
3. Emergent- The system as a whole becomes unpredictable as a result of the interactions which no one can control.
?
In a nutshell, complexity is the absence of data points and information that we traditionally rely upon to make decisions. It does not mean that there is no information. There may be weak signals that are hard to pick up as long as we are stuck in the mindset that we traditionally rely upon.
?
We are moving into an age of globally connected networks where continuous disruption is the norm; where information is increasingly produced and consumed through social media; and where agility replaces every other parameter of success.
?
How can leaders emerge successful in an unpredictable, rapidly changing, complex world?
1. Do they need to think differently??
2. Do they need to behave differently?
3. Do they need to have a different a mindset?
?
The answer would be all of the above. It is vital for the leaders to nurture the capacity to be adaptive and shed their baggage in order to become more mindful, decisive and capable of rapid innovation.
Leaders need to develop a mindful mindset
?
Leaders need to work towards building a mindful mindset so that they can sense and actualise emerging possibilities that would otherwise be inaccessible.?
?
The leader?s state of mind becomes the vital link in addressing a complex situation, accessing a field in which decisions are made without complete information and action happens effortlessly.?
If you wish to learn more about leading in complexity and aspire to rewire your mindset to become a mindful leader, register for the Advanced Management Programme (AMP) conducted by PwC?s Academy.
?
The programme is designed specifically for CEOs, Directors and Business Leaders in Sri Lanka & South East Asian regions. AMP aims to drive the participants towards developing a better sense of judgement to lead in an uncertain and complex business world, provide them with new lenses and perspectives to make sharper decisions, adapt better and most importantly be mindful as a leader.??
?
Professor Edward Rogers, along with Professor Sudhanshu Palsule, will be conducting a unique session on ?Leading in Complexity and Mindful Leadership? during the first week of the programme.?
Participants would go through the Columbia Shuttle Simulation which was designed by NASA to train astronauts to lead in complex and uncertain environments.

## Title: Trump?s blockade is to  provoke regime change ? Cuban Ambassador

Trump?s blockade is to  provoke regime change ? Cuban Ambassador
	
Cuba?s National Assembly elected Miguel Diaz-Canel as the country?s President in April. Diaz-Canel followed Raul Castro who served two consecutive terms from 2008 when the health of his brother Fidel was in decline. Fidel Castro, who led the 1959 revolution that overthrew Fulgencio Batista?s dictatorship and ruled the country since died in 2016. The Daily Mirror talked to Cuba?s Ambassador in Colombo, Elena Ramos Rodriguez, on what may be expected from the new leader from a post-revolution generation, US President Donald Trump?s hardened policy towards Cuba, its effects on the Cuban people and Cuba?s response to the intensified economic blockade imposed by the US government.? ?
Excerpts:? ?
Elena Ramos Rodriguez
?
Cuba?s new President Miguel Diaz-Canel was born a year after the 1959 revolution, representing a relatively younger generation of politicians. Does this generational shift point to a change in Cuba?s style of government in years ahead?
I want to highlight the significance of the last session of the Cuban parliament, on April 18-19 when Mario Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez was elected the new President of the Council of State and President of the Council of Ministers. I think the new leader will continue the revolutionary process, will continue the development of our country, the development of our Socialism. Cuban people express their support for this electoral process. The people elect the members of Parliament, the Parliament elects the Council of State, and the Council of State elects the president. This process comes with the support of the people because a majority - 85.65% attended the polls to elect their representation in parliament, from each municipality. Voting is voluntary ? if you vote it means you support (the process).? ?
Diaz-Canel?s predecessor Raul Castro had started introducing certain changes- reducing the size of the state sector, encouraging more private enterprise, loosening some controls etc. with benefit to the economy. Will the new President continue on this trajectory?
Yes. The Cuban government and people are all working on updating the Cuban economic model. It is a complex process. It?s changing not because of pressure from outside but for Cuban society, to establish the economic and social guidance. It is a broad process, with many meetings with people in their workplaces, residential places etc. In Cuba, the programme does not change with each president. The guidelines are adopted with the opinion of all the population ? in different ways they participate in the process.? ?
?
"The Parliament elects the Council of State, and the Council of State elects the president. This process comes with the support of the people because a majority - 85.65% attended the polls to elect their representation in parliament, from each municipality? "
Former US President Barack Obama had started a process of normalization of Cuba-US relations, signalled by re-opening diplomatic missions in the two countries. Under Trump, this process is being reversed, and the economic blockade is being intensified. What will Cuba?s strategy be, to cope with this situation?
I think Obama?s years demonstrated that Cuba and the US can live and co-exist in a civilized way. Interactions between both sides show that Cuba and the US can exist, respecting our differences and cooperating, for the benefit of both countries and peoples, at the same time. Wherever there is an opportunity, we can cooperate.? ?
Opportunity such as ??
To stop drug trafficking, terrorism, illegal immigration. Intelligence is not the interest of one country ? it?s for both countries. We share maritime borders. We have to cooperate for example in maritime rescue, to save people. Or to avoid contamination of our maritime waters. Cuba wants to continue negotiating with the US government, but on conditions of equality and respect for our sovereignty. Cuba will not resign any of its principles. Principles are non-negotiable.? ?
But the fact is that you have a US President whose attitude is belligerent. How will you face this situation?
We have to face the new measures. In November last year the US Departments of State, Treasury and Commerce issued new provisions and regulations to implement and strengthen the blockade against Cuba - a week after the Nov. 1stvote in the UN General Assembly on the necessity to lift the blockade. These measures were in a new executive order of the President called ?National Security Presidential Memorandum on Strengthening the Policy of the US towards Cuba.? They restrict travel of American citizens to Cuba, restrict commerce between the two countries. During Obama?s time it was more flexible on some issues, but the blockade was still there, especially in the financial/ banking sector.? ?
In 2016 the US abstention (during the UN vote on lifting the blockade) was a hopeful moment. These measures confirm the regress of bilateral relations as a result of the decisions of the government of Donald Trump. It is also important to say, these measures ignore US public opinion of about 75% which is a great majority, and the international community, and of the Cuban immigrants in the US. The majority of Cuban immigrants want normal relations. Only a small group in Florida want to continue the blockade. This transformation ignores the majority of the international community. On Nov. 1st 2017 for the 26th consecutive occasion, the resolution on ?The necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the USA on Cuba? was approved by the General Assembly of the UN, with 191 votes in favour and two against: the US and Israel, confirming once again the absolute international rejection of this policy. Cuba will continue to present the resolution as long as the embargo is in place. Unfortunately the resolution is not binding. But it?s a good step to demonstrate that the international community supports Cuba.? ?
?
"MediCuba, the company that imports and exports medical products, received a communication from the supplier Lindmed Trade of Spain, saying it could not supply the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin Lactate because the manufacturer Claris Otsuka refused to sell the goods because Cuba was subject to sanctions imposed by the US"
The UN Secretary General in July last year presented a report, at the request of the members of the General Assembly, on the implementation of this resolution. Cuba said ?the accumulated losses caused by the embargo during nearly six decades it has been in place amount to US$ 822 billion.? Can you give an example of how this translates into deprivation in the day to day lives of the Cuban people?
The blockade affects all fields ? business, health, education, agriculture. To give an example ? in March 2017, MediCuba, the company that imports and exports medical products, received a communication from the supplier Lindmed Trade of Spain, saying it could not supply the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin Lactate because the manufacturer Claris Otsuka refused to sell the goods because Cuba was subject to sanctions imposed by the US.? ?
Ciprofloxacin Lactate is a broad spectrum antibiotic used for adults and children in the treatment of respiratory ailments. Also for skin, soft tissue, bones and joints affected by bacteria. This is an antibiotic used in all hospitals. This affects the health of our people not because the government doesn?t give the resources but because we cannot buy from the supplier.? ?
	I think the new leader will continue the revolutionary process, will continue the development of our country, the development of our Socialism
	
	
	The ending of the embargo was approved by the the UN, with 191 votes in favour and two againsT
	
	
	Cuba produces nickel. The company was unable to export 3,500 tons of it, produced in 2016 because they could not find a bank... 
	
	
	The blockade is the main obstacle to the development of our country. 
	
	
	The US wants to provoke a change of regime, by provoking anger of the people through shortages, by depriving them of food, medication.?? 
	
	
	Cuba appreciates support provided by Sri Lanka in its fight against the US embargo
	
	
	Our policy is to give what we have. Others give what they don?t use. Fifty-five per cent of state resources is allocated for budgeted activity 
	
Could you briefly explain the extra-territorial aspect of the embargo, how third parties ? other states - are punished for having transactions with Cuba? An example?
The case I just mentioned is also a good example of the extra-territorial impact. The supplier, the Spanish company cannot trade with Cuba. They too are affected. Legally they should be able to trade with Cuba. Also, many other companies have been sanctioned, fined, for doing business with Cuba.? ?
To give another example, Cuba produces nickel. The company was unable to export 3,500 tons of nickel sulphide produced in 2016 because they could not find a bank that would open a Letter of Credit. The loss to the Cuban economy was $23,600,000.? ?
In June 2016 the Netherlands mail and parcels company TNT returned to the Consulate General of Cuba in Madrid, two postal consignments addressed to the embassies of Cuba in China and Indonesia containing passports of Cubans living abroad. The company claimed that it had returned the consignments owing to corporate instructions related to the US embargo.? ?
The rest of the world supports Cuba on the need to end the embargo, which is in violation of the UN Charter and international law. Can you explain briefly, what is the problem the US has with Cuba?
The blockade is the main obstacle to the development of our country. The US wants to provoke a change of regime, by provoking anger of the people through shortages, by depriving them of food, medication etc. They want a regime change favourable to the US. It didn?t happen because the Cuban people stayed brave. This policy satisfies only the interests of a small minority of the American and Cuban-American extreme right-wing of South Florida, whose interest is to reverse the process of normalization of bilateral relations. It is a violation of human rights in general. We have a good economy but it would be better if we didn?t have the blockade. Tourism is greatly affected. People like to visit Cuba, last year we had four million visitors. Imagine if there was no blockade! American citizens are not allowed to travel to Cuba as tourists, it?s prohibited. They need a special licence from the Treasury.? ?
?
"I think Obama?s years demonstrated that Cuba and the US can live and co-exist in a civilized way. Interactions between both sides show that Cuba and the US can exist, respecting our differences and cooperating, for the benefit of both countries and peoples, at the same time. Wherever there is an opportunity, we can cooperate"
Cuba sends its professionals like goodwill ambassadors to all parts of the world ? doctors, teachers, artists, agriculture experts - demonstrating the high level of culture and education it has achieved for its people, in spite of the problems caused by its big neighbour. What is the secret of this achievement?
Our policy is ?internationalist.? One of the main principles in our relations with other countries is that we share what we have. If we can provide doctors, we do that. Our policy is to give what we have. Others give what they don?t use. Fifty-five per cent of state resources is allocated for budgeted activity such as education, public health, social security, pensions. That?s why there is a high standard. We believe you must support everybody. You cannot have homeless people. A mother who cannot work because her child has a disability will be provided with a government pension. It is a policy that demonstrates that even a poor nation that has not too many resources - if it uses resources for the welfare of the people - can grow its human capital, and improve living standards of the people, despite major challenges it faces. This is, maybe, our ?secret!?? ?
Sri Lanka was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Cuba after the revolution and (in the words of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his condolence message on the death of Fidel Castro) ?Cuba has been a great friend Sri Lanka could count on.? How can the Cuba-Sri Lanka relationship be taken forward?
A. Sri Lanka and Cuba have historic bonds of friendship and cooperation. Sri Lanka established diplomatic relations in 1959 after the triumph of the revolution, at the very beginning. The first step was the visit of Che Guevara to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka and Cuba both entered the Non Aligned Movement (NAM) in the same year, 1961. Cuba received the presidency of NAM from Sri Lanka in 1979. We have a long history of cooperation in sports, education, health, agriculture. At this moment we are working on areas of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. In June, a delegation from Sri Lanka visited Cuba to follow up on implementation of an MoU between the ministries of Science and Technology of the two countries. Last year a Cuban expert visited Sri Lanka to share expertise on the control of dengue. We are also working on registering in Sri Lanka a Cuban product for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. It has an efficiency of over 80%, many people have saved their legs, avoiding amputation. Cuba sincerely appreciates the support provided by Sri Lanka in its fight against the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States against Cuba for almost 60 years. On Nov. 1, once again Sri Lanka voted in favour of the Cuban revolution against the blockade in the General Assembly of the United Nations.??

UNP will never defend thieves: Akila
	
The United National Party (UNP) will at no time defend thieves, Party General Secretary and Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today.
He said this in response to a question asked by journalists at to what the party intended doing with regard to the UNPers who were alleged to have obtained money from Perpetual Treasuries owner Arjun Aloysius .
?We will not defend thieves but one must be not label anyone as a thief until it is proven that they have stolen money,? the minister said at a media briefing yesterday.
When asked who would be the UNP candidate at the next presidential election, he said the party would field its leader as the candidate.
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said some of the key points in the UNP policy of creating a wealthy nation have been picked up by former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and had included it in his Viyath Maga programme. He criticized Mr. Rajapaksa for saying he did not own a house in Kataragama because an electricity bill has been addressed to his name.
State Minister Harsha De Silva said there was a difference between a social market economy and a socialist market economy which Mr. Rajapaksa has talked about.
?Some have got mixed up with the economic programme. UNP policy is to maintain a social market economy and make Sri Lanka a hub of the Indian Ocean. Under the 2030 programme of Mr. Rajapaksa is to create socialist market programme based on competitiveness. Socialist market is a concept started by China. We talk of private sector being an engine of growth. Private sector includes SMEs, farmers, tuition masters and also large companies. In a social market economy one of the main factors is the market efficiency and social protection. In China enterprises are owned by Communist Party in China. Profits of enterprises in China go to the communist party. Is Mr. Rajapaksa going to hand over state enterprises to a political party,? the state minister said. (Yohan Perera)

REUTERS, 03rd JUNE, 2018-At least three people were killed after a five-story building collapsed in the Kenyan capital Nairobi in the early hours of Sunday, officials said.
It was not immediately clear what caused the collapse but the authorities say 30,000 to 40,000 buildings built without approval in the capital are at risk, and dozens have died in similar disasters in recent ?Until now, three people have lost their lives. Two were pulled out of the rubble in the morning and about an hour ago another man was found in the rubble,? the Mathare County?s Deputy Commissioner Patrick Mwangi told reporters. ?The operation is almost concluding and we hope that no one else is trapped or hurt in this tragedy,? he said.
Pius Maasai, head of the police department?s disaster management, said residents have been advised to vacate buildings deemed unsafe.
Rescue workers combed through the rubble of the building in the central Huduma district.
?(A) decision has been made that some of them will be knocked down straight away,? he said.
In June last year, two people died after a seven-story block fell down in Nairobi?s poor southern Pipeline Estate.

China warns  trade benefits at risk if US imposes tariffs
	
?
China warned the United States on Sunday that any agreements reached on trade and business between the two countries will be void if Washington implements tariffs and other trade measures, as the two ended their latest round of talks in Beijing.? ?
?A short statement, carried by the official Xinhua news agency, made no mention of any specific new agreements after U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.? ?
?It referred instead to a consensus they reached last month in Washington, when China agreed to significantly increase its purchases of U.S. goods and services.? ?
??To implement the consensus reached in Washington, the two sides have had good communication in various areas such as agriculture and energy, and have made positive and concrete progress,? the state news agency said, adding details would be subject to ?final confirmation by?
both parties?.? ?
?The United States and China have threatened tit-for-tat tariffs on goods worth up to $150 billion each.? ?
?Xinhua said China?s attitude had been consistent, that it was willing to increase imports from all countries, including the United States.? ?
?At the end of last month?s Washington talks the two countries put out a joint statement. But just when it appeared a trade truce between the two economic heavyweights was on the cards, the White House last week warned it would pursue tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, as well as impose restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States and tighter export controls.?
