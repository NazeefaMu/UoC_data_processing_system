BJP leaders discuss Tamils issue with SL ministers
	
A BJP team from Tamil Nadu on a Track II diplomatic mission has urged the Sri Lankan government to expedite democratic reforms under the 13th amendment to ensure devolution of powers to Tamil provinces and grant of equal rights to Tamils.
"The issue of the 13th amendment was discussed with Lankan minister for health Rajitha Senaratne and minister for resettlement D M Swaminathan," BJP national executive member L Ganesan said on his return from Colombo on Thursday.
Ganesan visited Sri Lanka on an invitation from Ilangai Jayaraj, popular orator and expert in Kamban Ramayana, to address a conference in Colombo on the 12 century Tamil epic.
Ganesan combined his cultural visit with a Track II diplomatic mission with state BJP vice president M Chakravarthy to meet Tamils and interact with Sri Lankan ministers, as a follow up to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state to the island nation in March.
"The issue of giving equal rights to Tamils was discussed with Sri Lankan minister for health Rajitha Senaratne and minister for resettlement D M Swaminathan," said the BJP national executive member.
Ganesan said the ministers had conveyed their government's commitment to rehabilitate around 80,000 war widows through professional training and skill development programmes.
During their five-day visit, a delegation of Tamils from Jaffna called on the BJP leaders. The delegation invited them to the northern provinces. Indian origin Tamil settlers in tea estates had also met them.
Chakravarthy said both Sinhalese and Tamils "are slowly getting out of the LTTE phobia and looking towards the future".
Speaking about conference, Ganesan said: "Jayaraj has been organising annual conferences on Asian epics and related literature for the past 25 years. This time he invited me to deliver the keynote address."
The conference was inaugurated by Malaysian deputy minister for sports M Sarvananan on May 1.
The BJP leaders also joined the Buddha Purnima celebrations in Colombo. "I have not seen something like this for a long time. Every street was crowded in the Lankan capital with people and vehicles. People lined up patiently to receive food specially prepared for the occasion and distributed in various parts of the city," he recalled. (The Times of India)

## Title: Defeat of LTTE and Demise of Tiger Leader Prabhakaran  in May  2009

Defeat of LTTE and Demise of Tiger Leader Prabhakaran  in May  2009
	
By D.B.S. JeyarajThe month of May is significant in the history of the Tamil secessionist armed struggle in Sri Lanka. It was on May 5, ?1976, that a section of ?militant Sri Lankan Tamil youths re-organized themselves into ?an ?organization ?called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) which had the establishment of a separate ?Tamil State on the Island ?through armed struggle as its fundamental objective. It was on May 14, 1976, that the chief political configuration of the Sri Lankan Tamils re-named itself as the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) and adopted a resolution demanding the creation of a Tamil State called ?Tamil Eelam?comprising the Northern and Eastern Provinces of the Island. Decades later in May 2009, the ?Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam underwent a total military defeat at the hands of the Sri Lankan armed forces in the Mullaitheevu district of Sri Lanka?s northern province. Four days in May from May 15 to May 18 were of crucial importance in this regard. On May 19, 2009, ? South Asia?s longest war came to an end with the official announcement that the LTTE leader Thiruvengadam Veluppillai Prabhakaran was dead. His body was recovered on the banks of the Mullaitheevu lagoon known as ?Nandhikkadal?.
It can be seen therefore, that the ?first half of May has proved to be of ?great significance in the Tamil armed struggle for Tamil Eelam spearheaded by the LTTE known as the Tigers. It is against this backdrop that this column ?in this week of May re-visits ?some of my earlier writings in the ?past and focuses on the rise and fall of the LTTE and death of Tiger supremo ?Prabhakaran.
The evolution and growth of the armed struggle for the goal of Tamil Eelam ?in Sri Lanka saw many Tamil militant groups emerge across the politico-military horizon. There was a time when nearly 34 outfits - big and small - existed. Among all these, the single organization that kept the Tamil armed struggle alive was none other than the LTTE led by Velupillai Prabhakaran. The LTTE under Prabhakaran fought on relentlessly towards its avowed objective of a separate Tamil State until the very last.?Thirumeni?Family
Prabhakaran was born on November 26, 1954. He was the youngest in a family of ?two boys and two girls. Since he was the youngest, Prabhakaran?s pet name was ?Thambi?or younger brother. His father was Veerasamy Thiruvengadam Veluppillai. Prabhakaran?s mother?s name is Paarvathipillai. ?Prabhakaran?s family hailed from the coastal town of Valvettithurai, referred to generally as VVT. Prabhakaran?s family was of respected lineage in VVT. They were known as belonging to the ?Thirumeni kudumbam? or Thirumeni family. Prabhakaran?s ancestors constructed the famous Sivan Temple of VVT.?
As a schoolboy, Prabhakaran, like most youngsters of his age was fond of cycling and playing volley ball and soccer. But he was no sportsman and preferred to read or watch action films. Another pursuit in boyhood was the targeting of squirrels, lizards, Chameleons and small birds with a catapult. As a kid, Praba would prowl about areas of dense vegetation searching for his quarry. His memory power was legendary. Prabhakaran would remember faces, names and the last time he had seen someone years ago. His eyes were always sharp and roving taking in the surrounding area and ever on the alert. As his eyes were large and striking, Prabhakaran was ?teased as ?muliyan? (goggle-eyed).
Prabhakaran?s attitude and political thinking was shaped by contemporary events and environment. The gruesome tales he heard as a four-year-old child about the 1958 anti-Tamil violence impacted greatly. One day, Prabhakaran?s home had a female visitor whose legs were scarred by burns. Upon inquiring, the little boy was told that the woman?s home had been set on fire by a ?Sinhala? mob. She had escaped with burns. Young Praba also heard the famous story of the Brahmin priest in Panadura being burnt to death in a bonfire, and also about the infant thrown into a tar barrel. All these tales made an indelible impression.
Being a native of Valvettithurai was another factor in making a militant out of Prabhakaran. VVT had acquired a reputation for smuggling and had a sub-culture of its own. ?Operation Monty? was launched by the armed forces in post-independence Sri Lanka to check and counter illicit immigration and smuggling. This necessitated the setting up of security camps in VVT from the early fifties of the last century. There was much friction as a result of this military ?presence. This in turn led to a confrontational mood prevailing between the people and armed forces long before the political crisis escalated in the seventies. It was in this environment that Prabhakaran and a host of other VVT youth grew up ?in Valvettithurai ?with anger and resentment towards the armed forces and by extension the government in Colombo held responsible.?"The militant youths referred to as ?Boys? did not agree with this and continued to pursue their goal of Tamil Eelam through violent methods"Venugopal Master
Prabhakaran growing up in this atmosphere got politically motivated in the late sixties and early seventies of the previous century. This was when former Kayts MP V. Navaratnam broke away from the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) known as Federal Party (FP) in English. Navaratnam once described as the ?golden brain? of the FP formed the ?Thamizhar Suyaatchi Kazhagham? or Tamil self-rule party in 1968. Navaratnam abandoned the federal demand as being too little and too late and instead opted for ?Suyaatchi? or ?self-rule? - a euphemism of sorts for a separate State. There was a pedagogue named Venugopal master for whom Prabhakaran had great regard and respect. Venugopal master became an active supporter of Navaratnam. Several students, including Prabhakaran became his followers and turned into ardent devotees of Tamil self-rule.
The Suyaatchi Kazhagham also started a newspaper ?Viduthalai? (Liberation/Freedom). ?Navaratnam himself translated and serialized ?Exodus? the famous novel written by Leon Uris. It was named ?Namakkendroru Naadu? (A Country of our own), young Prabhakaran eagerly devoured it and became hooked on the dream of a country for Tamils. The Tamil self-rule party was defeated in the 1970 polls. No candidate, including Navaratnam won. But the seeds of self-rule sowed in the campaign had taken firm root in the heart and mind of ?Prabhakaran.
With the introduction of standardization in 1970, the student population of Jaffna began getting radicalized. The Tamil Maanavar Peravai (Tamil Students? Federation) and Tamil Ilaignar Peravai (Tamil Youth Federation) were formed. A series of meetings, processions and rallies were held. Prabhakaran himself began participating in some of these activities and also attended most of the Tamil student and youth activist meetings. Soon he began losing interest in meetings and non-violent agitation. These were too tame for him. Greatly inspired by tales of Israel?s Hagannah and Irgun; Prabhakaran became firmly convinced that perceived ?Sri Lankan State oppression could be resisted only through force.
It was then that Prabhakaran wanted to buy a gun and practise shooting. There was a notorious ?chandiyan? (thug) then in Point Pedro called Sambandan. He sold guns illegally. When Prabhakaran approached him for one, Sambandan priced an old pistol at 150 rupees. Prabhakaran and some like-minded youths pooled their resources and came up with the princely sum of 40 rupees. Undeterred Prabhakaran sold his gold ring which had been given to him by his elder brother-in-law - as was the custom the younger brother of the bride - Prabhakaran, poured water on the bridegroom?s feet when he entered the bride?s house and got rewarded. This was how he acquired his first firearm.
Prabhakaran began training clandestinely under the names ?Maniam ?and Mani ?then. A retired soldier helped him in training. By now the youth was beginning to attract the attention of the Police. When the police started making inquiries about ?Mani? Prabha knew what was in store. He left home one day to embark on his avowed vocation. Anticipating future problems, ?Prabhakaran removed and destroyed every single photograph in the house with his picture. When the Police ?raided his home after Prabhakaran had fled, they could not get a proper picture of him and had to use only the postal identity card used by Prabhakaran to sit for examinations.Tamil New Tigers
Prabhakaran teamed up with some others and formed the Tamil New Tigers. Apparently some of the Tamil radicals ?in the ITAK like Rajaratnam of Nunaavil had formed a ?group named ?Tigers? to fight for Tamil rights in the early sixties. This never got-off the ground. Prabhakaran had begun interacting with Rajaratnam and felt the new movement should be a ?revival? of sorts. Hence, Tamil New Tigers (TNT). The acronym TNT was also applicable for the explosive compound ?Trinitrotoluene?.?
The TNT was led by Thanabalasingham alias Chetty of Kalviyankaadu. When the Police cracked down and began arresting prominent youth activists, Prabhakaran gave the slip and crossed over by sea to Tamil Nadu. He was to shuttle back and forth frequently in the seventies. Prabhakaran was never arrested in Sri Lanka. Several other youth groups also emerged and engaged in acts of violence. The TNT made its mark in July 1975 with the assassination of former Jaffna MP and Mayor Alfred Durayappah as he was going to worship at the Ponnaalai Varatharajapperumaal (Vishnu) Temple. Four youths, including Prabhakaran were involved in the murder. Later Prabhakaran went on record that this killing was his ?first military action?.
The TNT metamorphosed into the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) on May 5, 1976. On that day, around 40-50 Tamil youths ?met clandestinely at a secret location in the Jaffna peninsula and formed the LTTE. Uma Maheswaran became its leader. Prabhakaran was made Military Commander. A five-member committee was appointed to control and coordinate the new movement. Both Uma Maheswaran and Prabhakaran were members of this committee. Their objective was unambiguously clear. The LTTE?s goal was to establish an independent state called ?Tamil Eelam? in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka . A revolutionary armed struggle relying on guerrilla warfare was to be waged against the Sinhalese-dominated Sri Lankan State.
Nine days later, on May 14, the newly-formed Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) passed a resolution at Vaddukkoddai demanding Tamil Eelam - a separate state for the Tamils of Sri Lanka. In July 1977, the TULF contested the Parliamentary elections on a secessionist platform. The TULF said in its manifesto that the elections were a referendum, and that votes for the party meant a mandate for Tamil Eelam. The TULF swept the polls in the Tamil majority electorates of the North and East, winning 18 seats. TULF General Secretary Appapillai Amirthalingam became Leader of the Opposition.
The goals of the TULF and LTTE were the same on paper. In practice, the relatively moderate TULF was prepared to compromise and eventually agreed to the District Development Councils as an alternative to Tamil Eelam. The militant youths referred to as ?Boys? did not agree with this and continued to pursue their goal of Tamil Eelam through violent methods. The anti-Tamil pogrom of July 1983 was a watershed that brought moderate and militant Tamils together temporarily.
Meanwhile, the LTTE split into two. A large number of members broke away under the leadership of Uma Maheswaran and formed the People?s Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE). Some like Nagarajah, Aiyer etc., went their own way. Only a handful of the original LTTE members remained loyal to Prabhakaran. A frustrated Prabhakaran went away to India and stayed there for a while. In his absence, a triad comprising Seelan, Mahathaya and Ragu ?managed? the LTTE in Sri Lanka." Prabhakaran teamed up with some others and formed the Tamil New Tigers. Apparently some of the Tamil radicals ?in the ITAK like Rajaratnam of Nunaavil had formed a ?group named ?Tigers? to fight for Tamil rights "Thangathurai-Kuttimani
At one point the LTTE, with its depleted ranks, began working together with the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organisation (TELO) led by Thangathurai and Kuttimani. There was a time when Prabhakaran wanted to merge the LTTE remnants under him with the TELO and form a new organization. This, however, did not happen. The arrests of TELO leaders Thangathurai, Kuttimani and Jegan by the Navy in 1981, brought an end to TELO-LTTE cooperation.
Now the LTTE began functioning independently under Prabhakaran, who was both its Leader and Military Commander. Later Charles Anthony alias Seelan, became Military Chief. By July 1983, the LTTE cadre numbered 30. There were 23 full-time members and seven part-timers and there were also many ?helpers? of all ages from different walks of life.
The LTTE killed 13 soldiers through a landmine at Thirunelvely on July 23, 1983. This resulted in the 1983 anti-Tamil violence. There was a spontaneous ?rush? by Tamil youths to join the militant movements and fight for Tamil Eelam. India began training and arming the movements. The struggle for Tamil Eelam itself underwent many bizarre twists and peculiar turns. There was internecine warfare among the movements. The LTTE became the dominant Tamil group.
The Indo-Lanka Agreement of July 29, 1987, caused a sea of changes in Tamil politics. Except for the LTTE, all other Tamil parties and organizations accepted it and opted to give up the Tamil Eelam struggle and accept devolution provided under the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. The LTTE also agreed initially, surrendered some arms, and even accepted a monthly payment of money from New Delhi as an ?incentive? in the early stages. The Tigers, however, changed track soon and resumed hostilities, daring to take on the Indian Army.
The ?ensuing years ?saw ?many rounds of peace talks between the LTTE and different governments in Colombo. None of them succeeded and the country suffered endless war interspersed with temporary spells of no war.
In the meantime, the LTTE ?achieved tremendous ?growth? in certain aspects. The double-digit membership of 1983 reached ?five digits. The LTTE ?developed into a transnational entity ?with front/branch organizations among the widespread Tamil diaspora. From 1990, the LTTE has succeeded in keeping under its control sizeable parts of the north and east. The area of this de facto state has fluctuated periodically until the end came in May 2009. Tiger territory has increased and decreased according to the fortunes of war. Yet, there ?was for many years, a ?variable? sphere of LTTE control. Within this ?LTTE ?controlled? area, the Tigers set up structures like Police Stations, Courts, Inland Revenue Offices, TV, Radio, Film units, Newspapers, Banks, Immigration and Emigration Offices, business ventures, farms etc., They even drafted their own laws.
Militarily, the LTTE ?grew. The Tigers raised Infantry Brigades, Women?s Brigades, Commando units and specialized divisions for laying mines, sniping, firing mortars and artillery, resisting tanks and armoured cars etc. The Tigers also formed ?a naval wing known as Sea Tigers and a fledgling air wing called Air Tigers. The LTTE ?possessed many marine vessels and a limited number of small aircraft.Overseas Network
The LTTE also ?set up an elaborate overseas network with the Tamil diaspora as its base. There were multiple media organizations engaging in propaganda and myriad activists raising funds. The Tigers had ?the capacity to organize mass demonstrations at short notice in many Western cities. The LTTE also ran many commercial enterprises in several countries both West and East. They also ?ran a fleet of ships transporting arms acquired overseas to the North of Sri Lanka. In short, the LTTE?s growth in the post-83 era ?was phenomenal. It ?was perhaps the only enterprise run ?for, of and by? the Tamil people in Sri Lanka that ?registered a ?success? of this magnitude after July 1983.
This successful growth ?came at huge cost to the Tamil people of Sri Lanka. Vertically the LTTE ?went up, but horizontally the Sri Lankan Tamils ?went down. This ?was the unpleasant and inconvenient truth that the LTTE and acolytes often denied and did ?not like to hear being said ?in the past.
World War I was only four years long - from 1914 to 1918. World War II was six years - from 1939 to 1945. This war for Tamil Eelam ?went ?on for decades and decades with an intensity and ferocity that ?debilitated the Tamil people immensely. The Tamil-majority areas experienced ?a staggered ?scorched earth policy,? cunningly implemented in phases by different regimes. Death, injury, destruction, displacement, etc., were part of daily life.
Fishing dwindled. Agriculture diminished. Industry became virtually nonexistent. The economy decayed and unemployment ?was ?rampant. Single parent families, widows, orphans etc., were widely prevalent. Education, the mainstay of Tamils, suffered considerably. Many schools ?ceased function. Hospitals got run down. People were ?displaced from their homes under the pretext of setting up security zones. The quality of life ?decreased. Infant mortality rates, malnutrition, stunted growth etc., were areas where Tamils in the north and east are affected more than people elsewhere. The social fabric of Tamil society got ?torn asunder badly, cultural life shrank, values got brutalized, and ethical norms started ?crumbling. These were the effects of long-term war on a small, powerless people.
The worst impact has been on demography. Tamils ?left the country in very large numbers. Equally large numbers have moved to areas outside the north and east. Only 48% of Sri Lankan Tamils ?in the Island are said to be living in the north and east now. The Tamils may have proved a point by taking up arms against the State dominated by the numerically larger Sinhala people. But ultimately, demography was ?also defeating the Tamils.
After decades of fighting that ?debilitated and diminished the Tamil people, ?no ?concrete gains ?were made by the LTTE in winning back the lost rights of the Tamil people. Death, displacement and destruction ?enveloped the Tamil areas for many years. Despite all this suffering and sorrow undergone by the Tamil people, the ?LTTE ?had achieved nothing tangible ?in its perennial quest for Tamil Eelam.Writing on the Wall
The writing on the wall was discernible to any sensible observer of the military situation from 2007 onwards. Yet, Prabhakaran and his followers were oblivious to reality ?even as the army advanced. ?Kitta Varattum, Thittam Irukku? (Let them come near. We have a plan) was the parrot-like cry by the top leaders as the enemy neared. Apparently, Prabhakaran and the LTTE ?were not unduly concerned about the advancing armed forces for quite a while, as the Tigers were confident that the army would not be able to proceed beyond a certain point.
This assessment got skewered after the fall of Paranthan, which was a major turning point. Paranthan was followed by Kilinochchi and then Elephant Pass... the hasty evacuation of cadres trapped in the peninsula through a ?mini-Dunkirk? type of operation indicated that the Tigers were indeed caught napping. Even after losing the Jaffna-Kandy road or A-9 highway and all areas to its west, the LTTE was yet confident of withstanding the army for a much longer period in areas east of the A-9 highway. The final option was to ?carve? out an area of about 350-450 sq km in Mullaitheevvu district with access to the coast and then defend it strenuously.
But the rapid progress of the Army during this phase took the LTTE by surprise. Within a relatively quick period, the various military divisions and task forces ?made sweeping strides into Tiger territory. As a result the LTTE and hundreds of thousands of civilians were boxed into a small space that kept on shrinking as the army began advancing.
It was then that the alarm bells began ringing. The civilian casualty toll also started rising as more and more people were crammed into less and less land while the armed forces intensified operations. Now the ?pro-Tiger Tamil diaspora got into the act. Tamils began engaging in world-wide protests and demonstrations. There was a powerful intensity to these. Tamil Nadu too started boiling. New Delhi was under pressure.
It was here that Prabhakaran made four grave miscalculations. Underestimating in two and overestimating in two. He overestimated the impact and influence of the diaspora in the west and the pro-Tiger lobby in Tamil Nadu. The unfolding civilian catastrophe was his trump card. Prabhakaran thought the western nations could be made to exert adequate pressure on Colombo and make it call-off the war. Likewise he thought the passionate emotions of Tamil Nadu could sway New Delhi into moving against the war.
If these were overestimation errors, he also underestimated badly the Rajapaksa regime as well as the armed forces. Prabhakaran did not expect the armed forces to keep on progressing relentlessly as they did. But despite heavy losses, the military juggernaut kept on rolling forward. More importantly, he expected President Mahinda Rajapaksa would cave into international pressure and call it quits. Then again Rajapaksa too did not succumb and went ahead with the military campaign.Fool?s Paradise
But the biggest blunder of all was to believe wrongly that the LTTE could at some point deliver a crippling blow on the battlefront and exact a heavy casualty toll. This would demoralize the army and help reverse the process, Prabhakaran appears to have ?surmised. The politico-military situation deteriorated, but Prabhakaran living in a fool?s paradise was pretty sure that at some point the military drive would come to a halt. Thus he continued to stay put. If Prabhakaran was so inclined, he could have either relocated clandestinely to the Wanni or Weli-Oya/Manal Aaru jungles or escaped by sea to South-East Asia. But he did not do so.
Apparently he was relying very much on the massive counter-offensive being planned to destroy army defences in the Puthukkudiyiruppu region. But the military debacle on April 4-5, 2009 ?at Aanandapuram resulting in the deaths of 623 cadres, including his northern force commander ?Col? Theepan soured those plans. This writer then wrote in these columns ?that the LTTE could not recover from the Aanandapuram defeat and ?that this could be the defining moment of the war. That ?observation was proved correct subsequently.
Six weeks after Aanandapuram, ?the finale came in mid May. A beleaguered Prabhakaran and ?his senior Tigers went into a brain-storming session. A decision was reached to launch a tripartite venture. One group of Tigers, including Prabhakaran was to break out from trapped positions and cross the lagoon and Paranthan-Mullaitheevu road or A-35 highway. Thereafter the Tigers would move into the vast Wanni jungles and operate. Some would move to the East. A second group of Tigers would contact the army and negotiate terms of surrender. The main objective was to obtain urgently needed medical treatment for injured cadres, family members and civilians. The third group was to engage in fierce rear guard action. The Tiger contingent tasked to fight to the last was led by none other than Charles Anthony, the eldest son of Prabhakaran. He was to be assisted by special commander from the East, Ramesh.?
The LTTE launched a massive attack on the armed forces shortly after midnight on Sunday, May 17. The attack was in three directions but mainly directed towards the Nandhikkadal lagoon area held by the 53 division. After fierce fighting led by Bhanu, the three Tiger contingents broke through. One was led by Jeyam, one by Pottu Amman and one by Soosai. The three contingents together numbered about 250-300. Almost all military leaders were part of the three groups trying to break out while the bulk of the political wing stayed behind to surrender.?Military Cordon
A very large number of Black Tigers died in the assault as explosive-strapped boys and girls jumped on army positions and blew themselves up. This created the ?gaps? for other Tigers to penetrate the military cordon. Though Tigers breached the 53- division defences, the soldiers began an intensive artillery barrage in which many died. Also the army had set up layers of defence with more personnel at the back. The LTTE cadres who broke through were to some extent sandwiched in between and ?later ?cut down. With the assault resulting in failure and many Tigers being encircled several LTTE cadres began consuming cyanide. Similarly, the Tiger ?defenders? led by Charles Anthony were also routed and many survivors swallowed cyanide to avoid capture. Later Charles Anthony was found dead with bullet injuries.
The group led by Soosai was initially successful in breaking out of the military cordon. Prabhakaran was with this group. They took cover in the shrubs by Nandhikkadal lagoon. Prabhakaran split from Soosai and embarked on a perilous mission to cross the lagoon by night ?and reach the safety of jungles in the early hours of the morning on May 18. Though Prabhakaran had at one time hundreds of cadres as bodyguards, only 18 elite fighters accompanied him on the final flight from Mullivaaikkaal. It has also been said that one bodyguard had a can of gasoline with him to burn the Tiger leader?s body if ever he was killed or committed suicide. This was to prevent the enemy seizing his body.
But all these expectations were belied on that fateful day. Prabhakaran?s body was discovered before dawn on Tuesday. The body of the 54-year-old supreme leader of the LTTE ?was found on Tuesday, May 19 near the Mullaitheevu lagoon known as ?Nanthikkadal? (sea of conches). He had gunshot wounds in the head and forehead. Soldiers of the 4th Vijayabahu infantry regiment led by Lt. Col. Rohitha Aluvihare claimed to have found it. Thus ended the life of the man who was once described by the LTTE?s political strategist, Anton Stanislaus Balasingham, as both ?the President and Prime Minister of Tamil Eelam?. Army commander Sarath Fonseka announced the death officially at 12.15 p.m. on May 19.
The ephemeral nature of power was illustrated vividly by the death of Prabhakaran who controlled what was perhaps the most powerful guerrilla organization in the world, and was raised to divine status as ?Sooriyathevan? (Sun God) by his sycophantic followers. The circumstances of his death were, just as in life, mired in controversy.
Prabhakaran who commenced his militant career with a single pistol had over the years built up the LTTE into a powerful movement running a shadow state and acquired the status of being ?Tamil National Leader? (Thesiyath Thalaiver). Yet his inability or unwillingness to be flexible had resulted in Prabhakaran losing his movement, family and above all, his life in a pathetic manner.Elusive Goal
Like a compulsive gambler, Prabhakaran ?risked the entire existence of the Tamil people as a vibrant ethnicity in Sri Lanka for the elusive goal of Tamil Eelam. It was ?an all or nothing gamble for him. He was ?like an invading military general who burns his boats so that his soldiers have no choice other than to fight on for victory or face death. There is no turning back. If the soldiers win the war, the general will be praised for his steely determination. If they lose, there won?t be anyone left to tell the tale.
Ultimately that is what had happened. Prabhakaran and the LTTE are no more but the irredeemable harm caused to the Tamil people ?lives after them?.?D.B.S.Jeyaraj can be reached at dbsjeyaraj@yahoo.com

SL plane with horses from Pak makes emergency landing
	
	A special aircraft, belonging to the Sri Lanka defence forces, carrying eight horses from Pakistan to Sri Lanka made an emergency landing at the Pune International Airport on Thursday due to a technical snag. Intelligence agencies and police swung into action within minutes and the horses and their Pakistani handlers were stationed at the Pune Race Course.
	As per the information given by sources from the Pune airport?s security division, the eight horses were being sent to Colombo from Islamabad as part of a friendly exchange between the Pakistan Army and Sri Lanka Army. The engine of the C-130 military transport aircraft developed a snag mid-air and the plane had to make an emergency landing at the airport around midnight.
	Sources said eight horses bred in Pakistan, eight personnel from the Sri Lanka defence forces, four horse handlers, who are citizens of Pakistan, and a Pakistan Army officer were on board. A team comprising personnel from intelligence bureau, military intelligence, airport security and local police spoke to the people on board and recorded their statements.
	A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said, ?The horses and their handlers were moved to Pune Race Course. They will be stationed there till the snag is rectified. The members of the Sri Lankan team have been stationed at a hotel in Balewadi. We have been told that some spare parts of the engine of this transport aircraft will be flown to Pune by another aircraft and these personnel and horses will be in Pune till the problem is resolved. It might take another day.?
	Sources from intelligence agencies said their team was pressed into action as there were a lot of ?questions marks? about the incident. ?We were suspicious because Pune is an important military station and the race course here is located in the defence area. Also, the people on board were military personnel, including an officer of major rank. We will be closely monitoring the matter till the plane takes off from here.?
	In 2013, the Pakistan Army had gifted six thoroughbred horses to the Sri Lanka Army. Police said they believed that these horses were also being transported for a similar purpose.
	When the Newsline team visited the premises of the Pune Race Course on Thursday afternoon, a team from local police had come to the stable where the horses were kept. The main area, where the stables are, was covered. Police said secrecy was being maintained as it was a ?matter concerning foreign countries and intelligence agencies were closely monitoring it?.
	Vivek Jain, a member of the RWITC managing committee, confirmed that the eight horses being flown from Pakistan to Sri Lanka had been kept at the race course premises. ?There was a lot of pressure on the club from the Army and Home ministry that the horses be stationed at the race course. We were initially reluctant because the entire horse population of the club is at present stationed in Pune and there is always a fear of diseases spreading. Also, Pune has no quarantine facility. But then the horses were accommodated in the unsaddling enclosure and we have provided them with feed and water. They will be here till the aircraft snag is addressed,? said Jain.

Lankan pleads guilty in hit-and-run case in NZ
	
	A man has admitted he struck a woman while driving a rental car and talking on a mobile phone, then fled the scene.
	Sri Lankan national Viraj Goonasekera, 25, who is in New Zealand on a work permit, today pleaded guilty to charges of careless driving causing injury, making a false statement to police claiming a car had been willfully damaged and failing to stop and help after an accident.
	Goonasekera was returning from work at Auckland Airport in the early hours of March 29, when he struck Michele Foster-Chambers as she crossed Great North Road.
	It was revealed in court today that he had been talking on his mobile phone while driving at the time of the crash.
	He stopped and got out of the car, but failed to ascertain whether Ms Foster-Chambers, who had been flung on to the road after landing on the bonnet and windscreen of Goonasekera's rented vehicle, had suffered serious injuries.
	He left the scene, called a tow-truck for his car, and told police his car had been damaged while he was in a restaurant near the scene.
	In April, police released photos of a blue Suzuki Swift that had been returned to a vehicle rental company bearing a large dent in the bonnet and a damaged windscreen.
	Goonasekera's lawyer Sam Fernando indicated he would be applying for his client to be discharged without conviction.
	Ms Foster-Chambers told the New Zealand Herald last month that she could not remember much about the collision but believed the car hit her legs, throwing her over the bonnet, and smashing her head into the windscreen before she landed on the road.
	Slipping in and out of consciousness, Ms Foster-Chambers said she dragged herself to the side of the road where she was eventually picked up by a good Samaritan and taken home.
	Goonasekera was remanded on bail ahead of his sentencing in July. (The New Zealand Herald)

The language problem in Sri Lanka was one of the main reasons for the 30-year war, and Sinhalese and Tamils should learn each other?s language to build co-existence between the two races, State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene said today.
The minister expressed these views at the Security Forces Headquarters in Jaffna while presenting certificates to 320 members of the armed forces who had completed a Tamil language course.
He said the security forces and Sinhala society would be able to win over the Tamil people through language.
Mr. Wijewardene noted there was a need to further study Tamil language and use new technology and procedures in teaching Tamil. He added that there was a need to enhance the teaching of languages in order to achieve peace and co-existence.
The ignorance of the Sinhala and Tamil languages by the people in the North and South had created a distance between the two races, and had served as an advantage to extremists among both races, he said.
The government also wanted to further develop the skills of the security forces while ensuring the protection of the country. He said the government wanted to solve the economic and the social problems the country is faced with.

Microimage HCM Asia Director Harsha Purasinghe said, ?This was a great opportunity to share technology challenges that HR leaders face today due to disruptive technologies.

Microimage HCM Asia took part in the three-day Congress along with other industry specialists to share perspectives and experiences with the 250-strong delegate audience.

He went on to emphasise the importance of understanding key technology shifts that have the power to enable HR to align talent with business needs. ?Effective use of cloud computing, smartphone apps and social media for productive collaboration and better employee engagement are just some of the key technology enablers that bring greater visibility to talent management,? he added.?

<U+200B>Ranil becomes UK MP
	
	Ranil Jayawardena of Sri Lankan origin romped to victory in North East Hampshire constituency, taking a near-30,000 vote majority over the Liberal Democrats, the Get Hampshire said.?
Conservative candidate Mr. Jayawardena will take the reins from James Arbuthnot, who bowed out after nearly 30 years as MP for North East Hampshire.
During Thursday's vote (May 7), Mr Jayawardena took 35,573 votes in total, a staggering 29,916 votes ahead of Liberal Democrat candidate Graham Cockarill.
Mr Cockarill received 5,657 votes, Amran Hussain (Labour) 5,290 votes, Robert Blay (UKIP) 4,732 votes, Andrew Johnston (Green Party) 2,364 votes and Max Bobetsky (Monster Racing Loony Party) 384 votes.
In total, 54,000 votes were cast from an electorate of 74,025, a turnout of 72.94%. 202 ballots were either spoiled or rejected.
Following the result, which came in around 4am, Mr Jayawardena said: "This is an important night for Britain - and an even more important night for North East Hampshire.
"I'm delighted more than 65% of voters have put their trust in me today," he added. "The people of North East Hampshire have given me the chance to serve.
"They have put their trust in me - and I shall repay that trust."
Speaking to Get Hampshire moments after stepping off the podium, a clearly very emotional Mr Jayawardena said: "I am very pleased that the people of North East Hampshire have put their trust in me - it is my home.
"I grew up in Odiham, went to school there and now I live in Bramley. I've served my community as a local councillor and I am very pleased I will be able to represent them in parliament."
However, the night was not without controversy, with Mr Jayawardena refusing a handshake from UKIP candidate Mr Blay.
It comes after Mr Blay was suspended by UKIP earlier this week after he was caught on camera by an undercover reporter from The Mirror threatening to "put a bullet" in Mr Jayawardena's head.
Mr Blay spoke to Get Hampshire during the count on Friday morning (May 8) and stressed he was still hoping to get back into the party's good books.
When asked if he regretted making the comments about Mr. Jayawardena, Mr Blay said he had no further comment to make.
Mr Cockarill, who was second to Mr Jayawardena, said he was pleased his party maintained a presence in the constituency, against a backdrop of huge Liberal Democrat losses nationwide.
Labour's Amran Hussain said: "I think I ran a very positive campaign, and I'm happy with the results I got.
"I wish Ranil the best of luck and I hope he takes his work to the doorsteps of the constituency. That is my wish and request from him."
Meanwhile, 'Mad' Max Bobetsky for the Monster Raving Loonies said: "It's been good considering we've never stood in this constituency before. I'm very happy that Ranil won and I'm sure he will do a great service."

Salman Khan's five-year sentence suspended
	
As Salman Khan?s two-day interim bail came to an end Friday, it was decided by the Bombay High Court to suspend the actor?s five-year sentence while his appeal was pending in the high court, Express News reported.
The appeal is set to be heard in July and the actor was ordered to be on best behaviour. Although he has to surrender his passport to the police, Salman would be able to travel abroad with prior permission, NDTV reported.
The actor?s lawyers also heard that Salman would have to file for a fresh plea.
At the court today, the hearing was presided over by Judge Abhay Thipsay who questioned the court ?why should his rights suffer when the appeal is still being heard??
Judge Thipsay further made comments pertaining to a notional custody, according to NDTV.
This put Salman?s defence in an encouraging position as they awaited the decision of whether his bail would be extended or whether he would go to jail.
Further, the judge asked the prosecutor why the case should not be treated only as a case of rash driving. He was also reported to have told the public prosecutor that a sentence under seven years could be suspended, according to The Times of India.
As news of the sentence being suspended was announced, scores of fans were seen outside Salman?s residence blocking roads and creating chaos.
The Kick star on Wednesday was handed a five-year sentence by a Mumbai sessions court in his hit-and-run case which found him guilty of culpable homicide.
With eight charges against Khan, including culpable homicide and a non-bailable offence, the court deemed him guilty.? (The Express Tribune)

Dewasiri responds to Vasu
	
	Responding to Democratic Left Front (DLF) leader Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Dewasiri yesterday said that Mr. Nanayakkara?s assessment that the May Day attack would have been expected implies that he too expected his supporters to react in a violent manner to opposing views.
	?I don?t know how he knows what my intentions of attending the rally were, but if he is saying I should have expected the attack then what he is indirectly saying is that he is aware of the forces that he is mobilizing, and how their supporters react to their opponents?, ? he said.
	?Mr. Nanayakkara said that I had a habit of labelling political movements and the Rajapaksa followers as a fascist movement, but by saying that I should expect attacks, he is indirectly admitting this. He knows that the Mahinda supporters have a habit of attacking their supporters. What does this mean? It means that it does not have a key democratic trait, that of tolerating the views of your opponent? he said
	Mr. Dewasiri further stated that his method was to attend public meetings of his political opponents and take issue with them at such gatherings but was never once assaulted.
	?I have been attending public meetings of my opponents since I was 16. I attended a JVP rally at the time I was anti JVP and even argued with full time members of the JVP on conflicting views. That is my way of doing politics,? he said.
	He expressed regret over the comment made by the left wing leader, stating that he had worked closely with him for many years and expected a more genuine condemnation.
	?He is almost sanctioning this attack, he has said to look into the issue, but they must actually condemn it without saying I should or would expect violence for expressing my views. I have been doing politics with Vasudeva from the late eighties and worked closely with him since 1994. I was even the editor of his newspaper. I have great respect towards him, but I am really sorry to hear these kinds of comments coming from him? he said.
	He added that Mr. Nanayakkara was sending a very ?interesting? political message that one should not attend meetings of one?s political opponents. (Jehan Gunasekara)

MR rejects Mangala?s claim about $18 bn abroad
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today rejected the claim that he had deposited US$18 billion dollars in offshore accounts and said these reports were the devious means by which false propaganda against him was being spread.
This allegation was made by Minster Mangala Samaraweera during a news conference yesterday.
?I like to inform the public once again that I, my wife, my sons or my brothers have no secret offshore accounts or illegal overseas investments in front companies,? Mr. Rajapaksa said in a statement.
He said Foreign Minister Samaraweera who made the statement had covered himself by saying he did not know whether this information was right or wrong.
?
The minister alleged that foreign intelligence agencies had informed the government that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family members had deposited US$18 billion in secret offshore accounts.
?There was a time when any large house or hotel being built in Colombo or anywhere else in the country was supposed to belong to the members of my family. Such propaganda cannot be carried out now, so our political opponents have resorted to talking about money stashed overseas,? Mr. Rajapaksa said. (LSP)
