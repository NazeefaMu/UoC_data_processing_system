Google Loon project?s trials to begin soon
	
The trials of the Google Loon project would start soon in Ratmalana as the necessary equipment for such trials have arrived in the country, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said ?yesterday. ?
He said a team from Google to carry out the trials was expected this month.?
Sri Lanka entered into a partnership agreement with Google Inc. for the first mass deployment of Google?s high-altitude balloon-based Internet services in July last year.
Though brief trials have been conducted in New Zealand and Brazil, this would be the first country Google?s Loon project would be launched officially. ?The agreement is valid for a period of one year.
Information Communication and Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) MD/CEO Muhunthan Canagey said if the trails were satisfactory, Sri Lanka would enter a fully-fledged agreement with Google Inc. for the deployment of the balloons subject to necessary approvals from the Defence, Finance and other ministerial level approvals. Minister Fernando stressed that the investment put in by the Sri Lankan government in the project would be the spectrum.?
?For our investment, the Sri Lankan government will be a shareholder of the project. And also, the local telecom service providers will each be offered a 10 percent stake in the company.??
Google Loon?Fernando said 90 percent of the telecom services providers in the country are in favour of the project.?
?This project will bring down their (service providers) capital expenditure on telecom towers significantly. If someone is against it, I don?t understand their logic.?
The minister is expected to hold discussions with the country?s telecom services providers regarding the Google Loon project this week.
The telecom services providers were said to have made representations to the President Maithripala Sirisena, expressing their concerns about the Google Loon project.?
Sri Lanka?s Internet penetration is estimated at 26 percent.?
Fernando pointed out that with the Goole Loon project, the government expects to make the Internet accessible to the entire population at affordable rates.?
?If 10 percent the population have Internet, the GDP grows more than 1.2 percent. This is the impact Internet could have on a country?s economy,? the minister said, referring to findings of a recent research.?
Fernando, Canagey and Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene recently undertook a trip to Silicon Valley, San Francisco, USA and met with the top executives of tech giants such as Google, Facebook and PayPal. ?
Fernando said the response from the US-based IT giants towards helping Sri Lanka to transform into an ?innovation centre? was extremely forthcoming.

Impeachment motion if NA sung in Tamil: PHU
	
An impeachment motion could be brought against President Maithripala Sirisena if he allows the National Anthem (NA) to be sung in Tamil violating the Constitution, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila said today.
He said according to Section seven of the 1978 Constitution currently in force, the National Anthem could be sung only in Sinhala.
?A two-thirds majority in Parliament and a referendum is needed to change the National Anthem or to sing it in Tamil because Tamil language gained official status in 1987, through the Constitution,? he told a news conference.
He said they were not against singing it in Tamil so that it could be understood by Tamil speaking people but were opposed to singing it in Tamil at State functions such as the Independence Day celebrations.
Mr. Gammanpila said India has about 1,700 languages but the language of the National Anthem is Sanskritised Bengali.
?Tamil Nadu has a 30 million Tamil population but the Indian Anthem is sung in one language and not in Tamil. The importance of having an Anthem in one language is that it increases the harmony and the unity among communities. Imagine, singing two Sri Lankan anthems at a cricket match. Will it increase team spirit? No. In near future, there will be calls to sing the Anthem in Arabic as well,? he said.
Mr. Gammanpila said the move to sing the Anthem in Tamil would not improve reconciliation but would create divisions among the communities.
?If authorities think having two anthems would improve reconciliation, it is a myth. If we are preaching about one country, one nation and one flag then why can?t we have the Anthem in one language,? he asked. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Lady doctor accused in husband?s death in Australia
	
A renowned doctor had allegedly 'bludgeoned her abusive husband to death in Australia with a hammer in bed, because she was worried people would find out they were both having sex with a teenage girl.
The lady doctor accused of bashing her husband to death with a 1.79 kg hammer in the couple's bed feared people would find out about their sexual relationship with a teenager, an Australian court heard.
The dead man was found by Police in the foetal position in the lounge room of her home in Geraldton, north of Perth in Western Australia, in June 2014.
The lady doctor allegedly had blood splattered on her clothes and claimed to have no memory of the event, the West Australian reported.
The body of her husband was found in their bed with a pillow on his head.
Prosecutor Nick Cogin told Court on Monday the doctor and his wife started a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and that the lady had become worried about her career.
?It got to a stage that she was no longer prepared to put up with his behaviour,? Mr. Cogin said.
During an interview with Police, the lady doctor had claimed her husband was 'controlling' and 'physically violent'.
Defence lawyer George Giudice said she was a 'battered woman' and was frequently made to model in front of a camera to please him, according to The West Australian.
The Court heard the 10-minute emergency phone call the accused had made to triple-zero.
She repeatedly said she 'did not know what had happened,' and was barely audibly above her sobbing, the ABC reported.?
In his opening remarks, Mr. Cogin said she had not suffered any injuries on the night her husband was killed, suggesting he had not been violent towards her.
She also apologised to her brother-in-law and paramedics, who arrived at the scene following her husband death.
?Why would you apologise if you didn't do it?? Mr. Cogin said.
?Her actions constituted the offence of murder. Nothing justified what she did,? he said.
The trial in the Supreme Court continues.

New customs duty valuation to discourage motor vehicle imports
	
The new customs duty valuation proposed in the Budget 2016 will come into effect shortly, greatly reducing the number of vehicles coming into the country.
The new customs duty valuation proposed in the Budget 2016 will come into effect shortly, greatly reducing the number of vehicles coming into the country.
?It will come into effect shortly and the imports of electric vehicles and vans will go down 100 percent,? Vehicle Importers? Association of Lanka President Sampath Merenchige said.
Speaking at a press conference organised by the Finance Ministry, he added that taxes of vehicles above 1,000 cc will go up by 10 percent and those below 1,000 cc will increase by 20 percent.
Merenchige added that taxes on electric cars will go up by between 5-50 percent and taxes on vans will go up by as much as 85-150 percent depending on the models.
However, despite the decreased demand the government is expecting in order to reduce congestion on the streets, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that the income from vehicle import taxes will increase. ?We have calculated the reduction in demand from taxes into our projections and we are expecting Rs.240 billion in vehicle import taxes for 2016,? he said. However, a recent analysis into vehicle registrations said that the decreased demand would bring in taxes of just Rs.180 billion. The vehicle import tax income for 2015 was Rs.232 billion and in 2014, during the previous government, it had been around Rs.117 billion.
?This is the first government in history to which we have paid such high taxes,? Merenchige said. The budget proposal said that taxes would be added depending on a vehicle?s engine displacement, while the budget revealed that in order to stop devaluation of vehicles at Sri Lanka Customs, the government had been valuing vehicles at a ?full option? value of a manufacturer.
Customs Department Director General Chulananda Perera explained the rationale behind charging taxes at the ?full option? value. ?There were allegations by Member of Parliament Anura Kumara Dissanayake of devaluing a consignment of Prados for certain individuals.
There was no devaluation. The Customs Department followed protocol to the fullest. But there were some problems over the add-ons,? he said.
The batch of Prados had been imported in February 2015 on a permit basis, with a concessionary tax of Rs.5.1-5.2 million, as opposed to a standard non-permit tax of Rs.8.8-9 million.
Perera said that the full value of add-on options had not been disclosed by some as they had stated a depreciated value for usage and taxes in Japan, and when the individuals had gone to the Hambantota harbour, the Customs Officer in Charge had not allowed the vehicles to be released.
?The maximum possible tax for add-ons in a Prado is Rs.1.6 million and the fine for not disclosing is double the rate of a full option vehicle. So as a quick solution, the Finance Minister asked them to deposit a Rs.3.2 million figure as a guarantee and take the vehicle out while investigations continue,? he added.
He said that with the requirement of declaring a brand-new full option value, the fines had become defunct.
?We found Rs.320 million in extra income from converting fines to taxes,? Perera said.
Karunanayake said that with the new full-option tax, a Prado?s taxes had increase from Rs.5.2 million to Rs.6.7 million if imported with a permit.
?There were devaluations happening during the past government. No one asks about that. This is done by a select group of people to undermine our government,? he said.

The government will not proceed with the Theravada Kathikawath Bill if the monks oppose it, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told a group of monks, who met him at Temple Trees today.
He said the Kathikawath Bill was prepared by the Buddhist Clergy and not by the government and that the matter had to be handled by the monks.
?Decisions on issues pertaining to any religion should be taken by the relevant religious leaders and not by the government,? the Prime Minister said.
He also requested the Maha Nayake Theras to introduce some mechanism to ensure the effective administration of Viharas and other Buddhist religious institutions abroad because of the issues which had cropped up from time to time.
The Prime Minister also assured that it was the intention of the Government to make Sri Lanka the centre of Theravada Buddhism and added that it was essential to have an inventory of artifacts and treasures in ancient Temples so as to safeguard them. Further, he said a Sangha Adikaranaya (a special court) to hear cases pertaining to monks could be set up if the Buddhist clergy were interested in doing so.
The Prime Minister said a committee under the Youth Centre would be set up to address the concerns faced by student Bikkhus and assured that the government would provide laptop computers to student monks.

Refer Yoshitha's case to Court without delay: Nimal Siripala
	
While emphasizing the necessity to have a speedier judicial system to hear sensitive and public interest cases, SLFP ministers today urged the government to refer the charges against Yoshitha Rajapaksa to Court and to let it decide his innocence or guilt.
Minister and Senior SLFP Vice President Nimal Siripala De Silva told the media that there were serious allegations levelled against Yoshitha and that the SLFP politicians and supporters were concerned about the arrest because it was carried out by the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID).
?We do not agree with this arrest having opposed the setting up of the FCID and shooting down a cabinet paper presented by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on the FCID,? he said.
The minister said the Attorney General must speed up the legal proceedings against Yoshitha because the entire country was watching the case closely and added that he must not be kept in remand custody for months with the case dragging on for several years.
"That is why the SLFP of the view that there must be an accelerated legal system to hear cases of a highly sensitive nature," he said. ?A suspect is deemed innocent until proven guilty. We won't comment on the charges levelled against him. But we are sorry for his present predicament as he is the son of one of the patrons of our party. That is why we ask the government not to incarcerate him for years and mete out justice as early as possible."
Commenting on attempts to split the SLFP and form a new party by certain politicians who were elected to Parliament on the back of the SLFP, the minister said they were under a contract from the UNP to ensure its victory at the Local Government polls.
"This became apparent when Udaya Gammanpila told a talk show this morning that no one could prevent UNP?s victory unless there was no split in the SLFP. But what we and all right thinking people with a sound mind say is that the SLFP must remain a strong political party to defeat the UNP and the victory of the SLFP will be much easier if we split the UNP,? he said.
Responding to a journalist the minister said though the UNP and the SLFP were in agreement on the process to establish a Constitutional Assembly to draft the Constitution or to introduce Amendments, it should only be done with the consensus of all stakeholders.
"The debate on the resolution would be taken in the month of February with the consensus of all political parties in Parliament and then the Constitutional assembly will start the Constitutional reform process," he said. The Amendments will have to be approved by the Cabinet and then submitted to the Supreme Court before taking up for voting in Parliament." (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Three Bulgarians arrested in ATM scam in Galle
	
Three Bulgarian tourists who had illegally withdrawn money belonging to other people using forged ATM cards, were taken into custody by the Galle police this afternoon.
The police had launched an investigation after receiving a complaint from the manager of a state bank in the Galle town that a scam to steal money from ATMs was under way. They had tracked down the suspects and arrested them with some difficulty.
A customer had earlier complained that his ATM card had been seized by the machine when he attempted to withdraw money from his account. The manager had stated to police that he examined the CCTV camera to find a foreigner attempting to withdraw money from the ATM.
The bank officials, who were on the lookout, noticed two foreigners attempting to withdraw money while looking at the account number in a notebook which aroused their suspicions. The manager immediately informed the police, but the two men had fled the scene by the time they arrived.
However, the police gave chase and arrested the suspects who were hiding inside the toilets of a temple in the Kaluwella area at the time.
During investigations police recovered a bag containing money stolen from accounts belonging to other people. Police said that following the incident, several other banks in the Galle area had also complained that money being stolen in the same manner by people using their ATMs.

WHO issues global zika alert
	
A disease linked to the Zika virus in Latin America poses a global public health emergency requiring a united response, says the World Health Organization.
Experts are worried that the virus is spreading far and fast, with devastating consequences.
The infection has been linked to cases of microcephaly, in which babies are born with underdeveloped brains.
The WHO alert puts Zika in the same category of concern as Ebola.
It means research and aid will be fast-tracked to tackle the infection.
There have been around 4,000 reported cases of microcephaly in Brazil alone since October.
WHO director general, Margaret Chan called Zika an "extraordinary event" that needed a co-ordinated response.
"I am now declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities reported in Latin America following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014 constitutes a public health emergency of international concern."
She said the priorities were to protect pregnant women and their babies from harm and to control the mosquitoes that are spreading the virus.
Currently, there is no vaccine or medication to stop Zika. The only way to avoid catching it is to avoid getting bitten by the Aedes mosquitoes that transmit the infection.
The WHO has already warned that Zika is likely to "spread explosively" across nearly all of the Americas. More than 20 countries, including Brazil, are reporting cases.
Most infections are mild and cause few or no symptoms, although there have been some reported cases of a rare paralysis disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome.
The bigger health threat though is believed to be in pregnancy, to the unborn child.
Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust, said: "There is a long road ahead. As with Ebola, Zika has once again exposed the world's vulnerability to emerging infectious diseases and the devastation they can unleash. Alongside the emergency response that Zika necessitates, we must put in place the permanent reforms, health systems strengthening and proactive research agenda that are needed to make the global health system more resilient to the threat of future pandemics."
