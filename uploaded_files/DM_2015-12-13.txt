Fuel prices could go down in near future
	
The government was looking into the possibility of giving some redress to the people in the wake of fuel prices going down in the global market.
Minister of Petroleum Chandima Weerakkody said this in Parliament on Saturday in response to a statement made by Chief Opposition Whip Anura kumara Dissanayake who urged the government to reduce fuel prices and allow the people to enjoy the benefits of oil price reductions in the global market.
Mr. Dissanayake said a barrel of crude oil had come down to $ 46 from the earlier price which was $ 102.
Minister Weerakkody explained that at present Sri Lanka purchases fuel on credit and it would have to pay an interest if the payments were delayed by more than a month. However, he said plans were afoot to make these payments in a shorter period of time, in which case the benefit would be passed down to the people in the form of a fuel price reduction, he said.

Skeletal remains from Mannar mass grave to be sent abroad
	
	Skeletal remains found at an alleged mass grave at Thiruketheeswaran in Mannar will be sent overseas for DNA tests, The PTI reported quoting a lawyer.
	V S Niranjan, a lawyer at the Magistrates Court in Mannar, said yesterday that Magistrate M Alexrajah issued the order yesterday to send the remains of 88 skeletons found in 2013 at Thiruketheeswaran area.
	However, Judicial Medical Officer Dananjaya Waidyaratne, who had carried out the initial tests in 2013 after the discovery of the alleged mass grave, said there was no need to send them overseas and could be tested in Sri Lanka.
	Police officials, who carried out the investigations, had told the court that the site was a graveyard previously and the remains found there could be of people who died under natural circumstances and buried there.
	The police contention was challenged by several local voluntary organisations in a petition to the court, saying that a large number of people had disappeared in the area during the war between the LTTE and the government troops, and the remains could be of those who disappeared.

Tax on vehicles will not be changed- LVIA
	
	Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake assured that taxes imposed on vehicles by the 2016 budget will not be revised, Lanka Vehicle Importers' Association (LVIA) said today.
	Chairman of the Association Indika Sampath Merenchige said the Association had discussed the matter with the Ministry yesterday.
	Minister Karunanayake presenting the budget said that the unit rate of excise duty for the vehicles on the basis of cubic centimeters and duties on the percentage basis on certain vehicles would be revised.
	The Association earlier said with the proposal would increase prices between Rs. 200,000 to Rs. 2.5 million.
	We wanted several changes but we did not want to challenge the governments decision. We also discussed issues with regard to the new valuation system and the minister assured us that the system would not be revised, he said.
	He said the finance minister assured the tax imposed would be implemented as proposed for a 18 months period atleast as it granted the government a much needed income but would decreased thereafter.
	During the meeting, the minister said the decision to increase taxes was to ease the large amount of currency to foreign countries when importing vehicles, he said.
	Meanwhile, the Association said motorists could purchase vehicles that were imported before the decision was made at a slightly increased rate. Vehicles brought into the country after the tax increase would be available next month. Vehicles that were imported earlier could be purchased at 10 to 15 percent price hike, Mr. Merenchige said.
