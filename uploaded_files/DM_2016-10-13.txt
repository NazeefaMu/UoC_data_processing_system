In the wake of President Maitripala Sirisena lashing out at the alleged politicization of the FCID, CID and the Bribery Commission, National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa said it was time for the President to walk the talk.
He told a media conference that it was obvious that the President had directed his criticism at Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Mr. Weerawansa said the President was similarly critical of the VAT Bill but had failed to ensure that the government would not proceed with it.
People do not want the President to talk about issues without acting boldly to sort them out. It time for the President without confining himself to words to act now if he wields executive powers, he said.
If the conduct of any state body is directed according to a political agenda, it will be the worst form of abuse. The President who led those who secured power with the promise of upholding human rights and democratic values has come to terms with the fact that these state bodies are run according to political agendas. It means these government bodies are being used to suppress political opponents," Mr. Weerawansa said.
He said this criticism was directed at none other than the Prime Minister.(Kelum Bandara)

Claims consultancy opens office in Kandy
	
An insurance claims consultancy service office is now opened in Kandy as a measure that fills a large gap in the services provided by insurance companies, brokers and insurance agents to the insuring public.
Policyholders receive a prompt service prior to the issue of the insurance policy. However, when a claim arises, many policyholders have a difficulty in properly presenting claims to their insurance companies and obtaining settlement.
Most insurance claims involve technical issues and the claimants encounter difficulties in submitting their claims to their insurance companies. As a result, many valid claims are rejected and in some cases legitimate claims are reduced and the claimant does not receive a full indemnity.
A team of highly qualified insurance professionals, engineers and lawyers, who can advise the claimants and assist them to obtain their rightful entitlement under their policies, is employed.
The office is managed by Hilmy Sulaiman, who counts over 50 years of experience in insurance both in Sri Lanka and abroad.
To date, such a professional insurance claims consultancy has not been in operation in Sri Lanka. Sulaiman believes that through these services, he and his team provide a social service to the policyholders who need such assistance, especially those aggrieved and who have been aggrieving.

Ex-chief JMO's revision application: HC notices respondents
	
Colombo High Court Judge Pathmini N Ranawaka today noticed the respondents, cited by former chief JMO Ananda Samarasekara in his revision application, to appear in court on October 27.
He filed a revision application in the High Court after his anticipatory bail application filed in the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court in connection with the investigation into Wasim Thajudeens missing body parts, was rejected.
Mr. Samarasekaera cited the Attorney General and the OIC of the CIDs Homicide Division as respondents.
His anticipatory bail application was rejected by Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe.
When the application was taken up for consideration, Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake objected to the granting of bail on the grounds that witness statements alleged that a few days before Mr. Samarasekaras retirement, he had dispatched Thajudeens body parts.
The DSG informed Court that the CID was investigating the disappearance of the body parts under the Public Property Act on the basis that the body parts had been taken into the former JMO's custody and therefore they belonged to the State.
An anticipatory bail application can be filed by an individual seeking bail in anticipation of being named or arrested in connection with a nonbailable offence.
Mr. Samarasekara had also filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the imminent infringement of his fundamental rights in connection with the investigation into Wasim Thajudeens killing. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

JO challenges Ranil to respond to remarks by President
	
The joint opposition today challenged Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to give a direct response to the statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday including the Presidents displeasure at former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa being dragged to court after a case was filed against him by the Bribery Commission.
Addressing a media briefing, joint opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said the President had directly pointed his finger at the Prime Minister, accusing him of engaging in a political witch-hunt in the guise of investigating financial fraud through the CID, FCID and Bribery Commission.
The President has stated that he was not aware of such cases against the former Defence Secretary and three former commanders of the Navy. He has directly stated that these institutions cannot function according to a political agenda. It has now been proved that these institutions have continuously misled the country in order to fullfil the requirements of someone's political agenda, he added.
He said it was evident from the Presidents statement that he had lost the trust he had in the Prime Minister and that he was against the policies of the UNP. He also said this development was a warning sign to the Government that it would be toppled in the near future.
Meanwhile, joint opposition MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said the joint opposition would offer their fullest support to the President to help him put a stop to the corruption seen in the government under the UNP's leadership. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Maldives pulls out of Commonwealth
	
The Maldivian Government today announced that it would leave the Commonwealth, a collection of countries made up largely of former British colonies, citing the organisation had taken punitive actions against the Maldives despite the progress made by the country to strengthen democratic institutions.
Issuing a statement, the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Maldives said the decision to leave the Commonwealth was difficult, but inevitable.
The Maldives joined the Commonwealth in 1982 with high hopes and expectations, convinced that the organisation will be an arena for coordinating critical issues that the member States, in particular, the smallest members of the organisation face.
Since 2012, the Government of Maldives has been giving maximum cooperation to the Commonwealth, shown maximum transparency, and engaged with the Commonwealth at the highest levels.
The Government had high hopes that such level of engagement will produce fruitful results. Regrettably, the Commonwealth has not recognised that progress and achievements that the Maldives accomplished in cultivating a culture of democracy in the country and in building and strengthening democratic institutions.
The Government of President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom has enacted a total of 110 pieces of legislations. Out of which, 94 legislations were directly related to the core values set out in the Commonwealth Charter. An overwhelming majority of these legislations (69 out of 94) were specifically designed to promote human rights, to strengthen democratic governance, and to reinforce the separation of powers. These achievements have resulted in strengthening the rule of law and produced tangible outcomes in strengthening democratic institutions in the country.
The Commonwealth has sought to take punitive actions against the Maldives since 2012 after the then President of Maldives resigned, and transfer of power took place as per the procedures set out in the Constitution. The Commonwealths decision to penalise the Maldives was unjustified especially given that the Commission of National Inquiry (CoNI), established with the help of the Commonwealth, found that the transfer of power in the Maldives was consistent with the constitutional provisions.
Since then, the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) and the Commonwealth Secretariat have treated the Maldives unjustly and unfairly. The Commonwealth has sought to become an active participant in the domestic political discourse in the Maldives, which is contrary to the principles of the Charters of the UN and the Commonwealth. The CMAG and the Commonwealth Secretariat seem to be convinced that the Maldives, because of the high and favourable reputation that the country enjoys internationally, and also perhaps because it is a small State that lacks material power, would be an easy object that can be used, especially in the name of democracy promotion, to increase the organisations own relevance and leverage in international politics, the statement said.
The government however reassured that its international engagement would continue both bilaterally and multilaterally.

Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej dies at 88
	
Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch, has died after 70 years on the throne, the palace says.
The king, 88, was widely revered in Thailand. He was seen as a stabilising figure in a country hit by cycles of political turmoil and multiple coups.
He had been in poor health in recent years and made few public appearances.
The king's death comes as Thailand remains under military rule following a coup in 2014.
The palace had warned on Sunday that the king's health was "not stable".
Many Thais had been wearing pink to try to bring good luck to the ailing monarch. Hundreds of people had gathered outside the hospital where he was being treated.
King Bhumibol's heir-apparent is 63-year-old Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, who does not attract the same level of affection as his father.
Strict lese-majeste laws mean public discussion of the succession are punishable by lengthy jail terms.
Given the pivotal role the king has played in maintaining the balance of power in Thailand's volatile political environment, the succession will be a formidable challenge for the government, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok.
King Bhumibol, who was born in Cambridge in the US state of Massachusetts, acceded to the throne on 9 June 1946 after his brother, King Ananda Mahidol, died.
Though a constitutional monarch with limited powers, King Bhumibol was regarded by many Thais as semi-divine. They looked to him to intervene in times of high tension.
He was seen as a unifying and calming influence through numerous coups and 20 constitutions.
However, his critics argued he had endorsed military takeovers and at times had failed to speak out against human rights abuses. (BBC)

Dearie was referring to the 25-year prison terms he was mandated to give to Canadian nationals Sathajhan Sarachandran, Sahilal Sabaratnam, Thiruthanikan Thanigasalam in 2011 for conspiring to acquire surface-to-air missiles on behalf of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group fighting against the government of Sri Lanka.
The men filed a lawsuit in 2012 in Brooklyn Federal Court seeking a reduction in their sentences and disclosed details about the civil war chaos including the deaths of dozens of innocent children in a Sri Lankan air strike.
Now that weve become a little bit more sophisticated in our thinking about what is and is not terrorism, now that we know a lot more about the conflict in Sri Lanka and the horrors visited upon these people, perhaps theres a way to provide a fair measure of justice to all without condemning these men to essentially a life behind bars, Dearie said.
Federal prosecutors informed Dearie this month that the Brooklyn US Attorneys office had reached an agreement with lawyers for the three men which calls for essentially dropping the arms deal charge.
Their conviction for providing material support to a terrorist organization will remain along with the 15-year prison term.
As part of the agreement, the three men will be deported to Canada after completing their sentences.

Vidura tries to usurp Champikas place at opening ceremony
	
A tense situation arose at the opening ceremony of the Moragahahena bus stand in Horana when MP Vidura Wickremanayaka forcibly attempted to preside over the ceremony.
Even though the organizers had invited Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Champika Ranawaka as the Chief Guest, Wickremanayaka had reasoned that the facility should be declared open by an SLFP member as the project was initiated by the previous government.

A tense situation occurred when the officials at the ceremony had refused to allow the MP to get into a bus at the station and take the ministers place.
However, the facility was declared open as planned by Minister Ranawaka when he arrived at the scene a short while later.
