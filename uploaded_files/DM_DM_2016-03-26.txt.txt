No Islamist jihadi groups in SL, says Study
	
There are no Islamist jihadist groups in Sri Lanka, said a study commissioned by the Colombo-based International Centre for Ethnic Studies (ICES).
According to the Hindu, the study had gone into an accusation, made both from within and outside the Muslim community in recent years, that a jihadist movement was being formed in the Eastern province, where Muslims constitute around 37 per cent the population.
Discussion with representatives of Thablighi Jamaat, Thawheed and Sufi groups revealed that while there is [a] talk among discontented youth about espousing jihadi practices, these are just idle youth responding to the global trend in Islam, but with no motivation or the means to make this a reality.
Local organisations such as mosque federations are also keeping tabs on the community and nipping such ideas in the bud, said the study.
Quoting Tamil writer and intellectual M.A. Nuhman, the study refers to two reformist movements  Jamaat-e-Islami and Thabligh-i-Jamaat, both of which arrived in Sri Lanka during the 1950s.
While focusing on purifying Islamic practices, they had faced several conflicts with traditional Sufi groups.
However, the emergence of Saudi-based movements in Sri Lanka such as the Thawheed Jamaat has transformed the conflict into Wahabism [Thawheed] versus Sufism, the study has said.

Some ministries to come under PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has decided to bring under his supervision several ministries, which were subjected to bureaucracy during the Rakapaksa regime, that have not been able to achieve the targets set for the first two quarters.
This decision has been taken as some ministries which were exposed to rigid bureaucracy during the last regime had not yet been converted to suit the good governance concept of the United National Front Government.
Some activities of the Foreign Affairs Ministry were taken over during the 100 day programme and certain activities of the Education ministry have already been taken over. (Anjula Mahika Weerarathna)

Three Lankans charged with vehicle theft in Dubai
	
Three Sri Lankans fugitives in Dubai had allegedly sold eleven cars worth Dirham 2.8m in the absence and without the knowledge of their employer, the Dubai Criminal Court heard yesterday.
While the 43-year-old Kazakhstani investor and his partner were not in the country, the three staff members of a second-hand car company had exploited the opportunity and sold eleven cars to two persons after forging documents needed by RTA for ownership transfer, the Emirates 24/7 News reported.

On May 22 last year, the car dealer returned to the county to discover that his auto showroom was emptied out and that the three employees were not there.

Reviewing the CCTV camera footage, he found out that at around 4pm on the day before his return, four men came to the showroom and the three staff members helped them take out the cars. Later in the evening, other people came and took the remaining cars.

The three took their passports. One claimed that he needed it to renew his lease, the other claimed that he needed it for a surgery for his wife while the third told me that he wants it as he is looking for a job, the employer told the police.

Police found out that the three fled to Sri Lanka on the same flight on May 22.

Checking with RTA, it was found out that one of the staff members filled the forms and signed on and stamped transactions for selling the cars that were listed for exportation by the buyers.
 
The case was fixed for April 18.
