A bully boy enjoying a free run
	
?
This story is about the shenanigans of a local politico hailing from a village off Galle who is well known as a bully boy in the area.
?
This bully boy is a loyal follower of a deputy purohita who too has made a name for similar antics.?
If a celebration is held in a house in his area without inviting him to it as ?a distinguished guest?, the bully boy would send his goons to wreck the place and reduce it to shambles.?
If the politico comes to know that there are two trucks carrying sand loads on the way to a construction site, he would order that one truckload of sand be unloaded at a place he specifies.
Some people in this area make it a point to invite the bully boy to ceremonies held in their houses against their conscience for fear of being attacked when the ceremony is in progress, they say.

Public transport still operated under an SLFP Govt: Gemunu
	
Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association President Gemunu Wijeratne today charged that the public transportation was still under the administration of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) except in the North.
?This is the utmost truth which prevails in the country. No United National Party (UNP) member or this government controls the transportation system in the country. The Transport Minister is from the SLFP and all the Provincial Councils except the North are still controlled under a SLFP Government. This will be a big problem to move this Government forward,? he said.
The decisions taken by the Central government could not be put into practice due to SLFPers in the government. Because of that all the bus services in the country will come to a standstill, Wijerathne said.
"We had discussed several issues with the President including providing solutions to the heavy traffic situation and collecting bribes from the private buses. No favorable solution by this government has been forwarded. Law enforcement to the transport sectors were implemented but there isn't any progress to the private bus industry as discussed."
Any minister can decide the amount of fine imposed on road offenses but it should be implemented according to the constitution. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Retired Lankan journo has memoirs returned after theft
	
Retired journalist Don Abey was devastated when three pads of notes and a USB were stolen from his car in Chisholm earlier this month.
The theft represented the loss of four years of meticulous work on his memoirs. Mr. Abey dreaded digging out an early draft to edit and rewrite his book.
So imagine his delight when he spotted a plastic bag outside his garage on Monday containing his life story.
"It's a mighty huge relief and joy," Mr. Abey said.
"Imagine having four years of your work back and not having to write it again - that's a huge relief."
The 87-year-old's book will document his colourful career as a journalist in Sri Lanka and Australia - "what I couldn't report", as he explained on Tuesday.
Mr Abey will now make a few final tweaks, write a foreword and shop it around to different publishers with the aim to have it hit the shelves early in the New Year.
"It could cause some sort of a stir in some circles," Mr Abey said.
"We have to read what we know, what we knew and published and be damned, so that's what I'm going to do now."
The Canberra Times reported on Mr Abey's loss on December 7. Since then, the news has travelled to relatives in Vancouver, Sri Lanka and Dubai, and caused something of a stir locally for Mr Abey.
"When the news did break I was in the Woden shopping centre and the amount of people who stopped me, I was amazed how far the news went," Mr Abey said.
And Mr Abey said he has no hard feelings to whoever took his writing in the first place.
"I'm grateful to him [for returning it]," he said. (The Canberra Times)

SL?s internal war cost US$ 200 billion: Shivshankar Menon
	
Sri Lanka?s internal war which ended in May 2009, had cost the country around US$ 200 billion according to India?s former National Security Adviser and Foreign Secretary, Shivshankar Menon.
In his book Choices: Inside the Making of India?s Foreign Policy, Menon says that this estimate does not include the ?opportunity cost? to Sri Lanka which was once the fastest growing and the most open economy in South Asia.
About deaths, the veteran Indian diplomat turned security expert says that between 1983 and 2009, 80,000 to 100,000 people, including combatants from both sides, lost their lives. Among them were 30,000 to 50,000 civilians, 27,693 LTTE cadres, 23,790 Sri Lankan army personnel, and 1,155 men of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF).
The final stages of the war had created a little over 300,000 refugees or Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). The war had also left 1.6 million land mines in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
But the real casualty of the war was Sri Lanka?s composite society, something that the LTTE and Sinhala chauvinism are ?equally responsible for?, Menon says.
?Sri Lanka?s democracy was flawed by disappearances, killings, torture, detention, and widespread human rights abuses committed by all sides in the war. Civil-military relations were skewed, Sinhala society was militarized, and the brutalized remnants of Tamil civil society were leaderless, without direction or hope. Nor was there any sign of an attempt to come to terms with the legacy and result of the war, to undertake real reconciliation,? he observes grimly.
Menon points out that LTTE chief Prabhakaran had left his Sri Lankan Tamil community ?gutted and brutalized? by his war.
?The Jaffna Tamils, who had once fed, led, ruled and thought for Ceylon, were reduced to a group of refugees in their own country and abroad, dependent on aid and the dole, their best and brightest dead or in exile. In death and in life, Prabhakaran?s baleful impact on his people continued to take its toll.?
Menon appreciates Sri Lanka?s successes in post-war rehabilitation, but adds that ?peace is more than an absence of violence and the presence of basic infrastructure. It is also in the mind.?
And this is where Sri Lanka has failed since the war, he points out and adds that both the Sinhalese and the Tamils have failed to grasp the nettle.
?A victorious regime under Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Sinhala majority did not show the magnanimity in victory that true peace requires. Equally, the Tamil community does not have leaders left, who can make peace. A Mandela needs a De Klerk and vice versa. Neither is visible in Sri Lanka.?
?In Sri Lanka, politics is stunted on both sides. Nor has either side, or the international community, managed to get past the arguments of the past. How relevant those arguments of the past are today, is debatable,? he says.
Harping on the past and the solutions offered in the past ?shows a paucity of leadership and thought? in both the Sinhala and Tamil parties, Menon points out.
He recalls that India had urged Rajapaksa that if he was to be the ?leader of all Sri Lankans? he should reach out through devolution of political power, restore human rights, and give a ?sense of dignity to the victor and the vanquished alike.?
But Rajapaksa could not bring himself to be politically magnanimous in victory, Menon says. (The Indian Express)

Speeding politico's daughter halted after chase
	
A prominent politician?s 20 year-old daughter, who drove her defender jeep violating traffic laws, was caught by two policemen attached to the Nittambuwa Police station, after giving chase for three kilometers at the Pasyala area on the Colombo-Kandy main road, police said.
The incident had taken place on Sunday at Weweldeniya in the Radawadunna area, when the policemen signalled to halt a defender jeep coming from Kandy, which had been travelling at high speed, overtaking vehicle by crossing the double lines. Despite the police order, the vehicle had sped away, prompting the policemen to give chase.
After giving chase for about three kilometers, the jeep was confronted by the Policemen. At that time, the driver, who happened to be a girl, had told police that she was the daughter of a politician and admitted her fault. Later the police had taken her driving licence, issued her a temporally licence and asked her to appear in the Attanagalla Magistrate Court for the case. (S.U.W.K.Jayawardane-Watupitiwala)

The Navy today assisted to load 1,086 cars and jeeps onboard a South Korean Vehicles Carrier, ?Glovis Phoenix? which arrived at the Hambantota port for the loading of vehicles, the Navy said.
It said the ship was scheduled to leave the Hambantota Port for its next port of call in Durban, South Africa, having the vehicles loaded expeditiously by tomorrow.
The Naval personnel made an extensive effort to rectify the damages caused on the generators, power supply system and cleared all the obstacles caused to equipment and machinery by these saboteurs.
The swift involvement of the Sri Lanka Navy helped reduce the potential losses that would have been suffered by the Sri Lankan Government due to non-operations of the harbour as a result of the sabotage carried out by port employees, the Navy said in a statement.
The protest campaign staged by the port employees of Hambantota Harbour on 7th December 2016 continues to its seventh day as of today hampering the routine work of the Hambantota Port.
The Navy said it got the tense situation which erupted on 10th December under control restoring back the security of the harbour and establishing normalcy.
