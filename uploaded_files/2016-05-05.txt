Bopage's statement no big deal: DM
	
While admitting that Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Ministry Secretary Nimal Bopage's statement on the joint opposition was a blunder, Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranawithana appealed to the media to desist from creating a furor over it.
He said a ministry secretary did not have the authority to issue statements on a personnel view and that the mistake was further aggravated because he had done so on a ministry letter head.
?I believe it to be a genuine mistake without any ulterior motive. But the mistake is a mistake.
Therefore, Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunatilaka has instructed him not to repeat it in future and I expect he will abide by it,? the deputy minister said.
He agreed with the journalists that there was a political group describing itself as the joint opposition and that the entire country identified it as a section of the SLFP and as such the media had every right to use the word joint opposition.
Responding to a journalist, the deputy minister said he was not aware of a move to remove Mr. Bopage from his post and added it was up to President Maithripala Sirisena to take a decision on the matter as he was the appointing authority of Ministry Secretaries.
He said no legal action would be taken against any media institution or journalist for using the words ?joint opposition?. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today the Government and the other provincial councils should also respond to the resolution adopted by the Northern Provincial Council just as was done by the Western Provincial Council which passed a resolution opposing the NPC resolution.
JHU leader Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera asked why other provincial councils could not oppose the resolution adopted in the Northern Provincial Council and asked whether they were acting to please western forces and Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran.
?We must appreciate the move taken by the WPC members and the Chief Minster for reacting to the NPC resolution. We request members of other provincial councils and Chief Ministers to show their protest on separatist moves by the NPC,? he said.
The Thera asked the government to immediately react to the resolution adopted by theNPC and added that silence might suggest the tacit approval of the resolution.
Ven. Sobitha Thera said it was not the Tamil people who nurtured separatist ideologies but it was the power hungry Tamil politicians who were trying to promote separatism and that it was not being done for the benefit of the Tamil people.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Narahenpita Crimes OIC re-remanded till May 12
	
Colombo Additional Magistrate Augusta Atapattu today ordered that former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera be remanded till May 12, while the CID asserted in Court that the investigation of an accident did not come within the purview of the crimes OIC.
Producing the suspect before the Magistrate in connection with the inquiry into murder of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen today, the CID said they were suspicions over the behaviour of the crimes OIC because he had given contradictory statements to the CID on six occasions.
They said in the statement made by the suspect to the Police he had said that immediately after the incident he informed about it to the OIC over the phone. But there was no proof to prove that assertion.
The CID said they were investigating to identify the person who gave instructions to the OIC to conduct investigations into the accident.
The detectives also said there was no entry made in the traffic note book and the police had not summoned the motor traffic examiner to the scene to conduct investigations.
The detectives requested the Magistrate to remand the suspect, since they had to record statements from constables of the Narahenpita Police and conduct further investigations further.
Counsel Ajith Pathirana and Anton Senanayake appearing for the suspect said the suspect had worked in the police department as an IP for over 18 years and immediately after the incident he was transferred to the Pedurutuduwa Police.
He said even though the CID alleged that the suspect had not performed his duties properly his client immediately after the incident had informed it to the SSP, the JMO had even called the police SOCO unit to conduct investigations and the Government Analyst to the scene. However investigations were meanwhile handed over to the CCD by the IGP.
The counsel said the offence was a bailable one and requested that the suspect be released on bail.
Counsel Mohamed Misba appearing for aggrieved Wasim Thajudeen?s parents said at the time the accident, the police ruled that the incident was an accident and the Magistrate accordingly had given his decisions.
Later it was ruled a murder and ordered to conduct investigations to bring the culprits to book.
Therefore Mr. Misba said the police can remand a suspect on suspicion even before investigations.
The Magistrate Augusta Atapattu said that she was only aware of the facts disclosed by the media over the case and said she would remand the suspect till May12 and ordered the parties to make submissions before the permanent Magistrate who is inquiring the case. (T. Farook Thajudeen)

Poor condition at the Dehiwala Zoo
	
The Born Free foundation, an international wildlife charity based in UK recently released a statement regarding the Dehiwela Zoo, with regard to the poor conditions at the Zoo and possible welfare concerns for the animals.
The Foundation that runs a Zoo Check programme in its release said that it was willing to work with the Government of Sri Lanka to implement a few changes within the zoo. ?Recently-released observations, photographs and video footage from Dehiwala Zoo, Colombo, Sri Lanka, have given rise to international concern, and appear to confirm recent observations by the Born Free Foundation, particularly with reference to the poor conditions at the Zoo and possible welfare concerns for the animals,? the foundation said.
In the light of these observations, the foundation is disappointed in the response from the World Association of Zoos and Aquaria (WAZA), of which Dehiwala Zoo is a member, which claims that ?positive changes have taken place and the zoo is evolving and improving?, that new plans will be available in the near future, and that WAZA intends to monitor the situation.
The Born Free Foundation is convinced that what is urgently required at the Zoo, in addition to short-term intervention to secure the welfare of the animals, is a strategic plan towards closure, involving consolidating the Zoo?s animal collection and re-homing many or all of the animals to alternative, good-quality facilities.
The foundation has further stated that they are aware of the allegations have been made regarding the trade in wild animals from the Zoo, and we call on the Ministry overseeing the Dehiwala Zoo to provide prompt and clear explanation and evidence to clarify this point.
Animal activists have been for years critical about the conditions of the welfare of the animals in the Dehiwela Zoo. More recently there was renewed interest by animal lovers, some of them even calling for the closure of the Zoo and an end to the animal performances there.
The Born Free Foundation takes action worldwide to save lives, stop suffering and protect species in the wild. Its major international projects are devoted to animal welfare, conservation and education, and protect lions, elephants, gorillas, chimpanzees, tigers, polar bears, wolves, dolphins, turtles, sharks and many other animals.(Kamanthi Wickramasinghe)

Supplementary estimate: Passage disputed
	
The total number of MPs' votes, for and against the supplementary estimate of Rs. 55 million, were found to be equal, after a perusal of the video footage, disputing the passage of it in the House.
Initially it was put to a vote in the House after JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake called for a division. While the vote was being taken, MPs entered the Chamber and participated in the voting. This led to confusion.
Afterwards, Government MP Lucky Jayawardane, who was presiding at the time, announced that there were 33 votes for and 31 against, and therefore the estimate had been approved.
However, some opposition members, particularly those of the JVP, protested and challenged the results. This led to a recount of the vote after viewing the video footage. Then it was found that there were 31 votes for and 31 against.
The government members asserted that a final vote cannot be reviewed outside the Chamber in this manner without the Speaker's permission.
Yet the opposition insisted that the initial false announcement should be annulled.
Chaos began when the opposition MPs trooped into the well of the House after MP Jayawardene announced that the supplementary head has been passed.
The vote was taken when Chief Opposition Whip Anura Dissanayake called for a division. While the counting was taking place members continued coming into the chamber. The vote of one member from the government was initially allowed. More members came in, including opposition MPs who requested that their votes should also be counted. However Mr. Jayawardane said the voting time was over. Members from both sides raised their voices and began arguing when the result was announced. Some were shouting at the chair and the Secretary General.
Opposition members, including Dinesh Gunawardena, Wimal Weerawansa, Rohitha Abeygunawardene, Pavithra Wanniarachchi and many others trooped into the well when the chair adjourned the sessions. Meanwhile the mace was taken away by the Serjeant and Arms signifying the ending of sessions.
The supplementary estimate was to seek the approval of the House to spend a total Rs 50 million for various purposes -- including some relief for the people and to purchase some security vehicles.
The UNP-led minority government was defeated when the approval of Parliament was sought for a regulation imposed under a financial Bill in April 2015. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)

Joint Opposition MP Prasanna Ranaweera, who was suspended for one week, protested the decision and called it totally unfair to victimize him without taking any action against UNP MP Sandith Samarasinghe who assaulted him.
Mr. Ranaweera in a letter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the decision to suspend him from parliamentary sessions for one week from today, had been taken in a manner which was not fair and transparent.
"A person who has been legally challenged by the joint opposition has been appointed to lead investigation in this regard. According to Standing Order 72(1), the Speaker should name the member concerned. Then, the Speaker should present a motion seeking the suspension. Yet, it has happened two days after the incident," he said.
He said, "I learnt that this decision was taken based on a report compiled by the Deputy Speaker and the Deputy Chairman of Committees after watching the video footage of the incident. None has represented the joint opposition which I belong to view this footage. The transparency of the process has been compromised. Against this backdrop, my suspension is an assault on the sovereign rights of the Gampaha district people whom I represent.?
