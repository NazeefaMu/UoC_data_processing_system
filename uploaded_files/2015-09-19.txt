Video: Gota regrets ending war
	
Former defense secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa said yesterday he now regretted to have finished the war because he had to undergo lots of trouble as a result of doing so.
Mr. Rajapaksa expressed these views when he came to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed to investigate serious acts of fraud, corruption and abuse of power, state resources, and privileges (PRECIFAC) yesterday, to give a statement over the Rakna Lanka armoury.
Mr. Rajapaksa said he has had to report to all these commissions as a result of ending the war.
?Today I feel sad to have finished the war. I have had to report to all these commissions just because I finished the war. None of these commissions would be there, if I had not finished the war,? he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said he might have to report to the UNHRC as well to give statements following the release of the UN report over the alleged war crimes.
He said the UN report was totally based on the needs of the Tamil Diaspora and said what the Diaspora wanted was to punish the security forces and the then political leaders.
Mr. Rajapaksa said he hoped that the President and the Prime Minister would not agree on a move to punish security forces or political leaders by an international court.Video by Sanath Desmond

I?ll throw the book at the book mafia: Ranil
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremeisnghe yesterday pledged to confront the text book mafia which prevented students from gaining access to quality text books.
At the opening of the Colombo International Book Fair at the BMICH yesterday, the Prime Minister said the Education Ministry was involved creating a monopoly of few publishers leaving out those known for quality text books.
?Our government will be accused of giving contracts to mudalalis but we will have to find good publishers who are prepared to supply quality text books,? he said.
The Prime Minister said unlike in the past, today's students had been deprived of reading books by famous authors like Martin Wickremesinghe.
?Martin Wickremesinghe may be thrown out of the Education Ministry if he happens to offer his books to the ministry in this time and age,? he said.
The Prime Minister said the allocation of funds to schools would be increased to ensure that schools would be in a position to buy quality text books and books for school libraries.
He said only 15 per cent of the funds allocated to school books was used for the purpose with a greater share spent on travelling, fuel and for other administrative purposes.
The Prime Minister said said there should be a balance between the new technology and the book-publishing tradition.
?The new technology has given the people the opportunity of reading books on the internet but one has to maintain a balance between the old and modern ways,? he said.(Yohan Perera)
