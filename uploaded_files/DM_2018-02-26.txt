Cabinet reshuffle not the solution: Champika
	
While claiming that the Cabinet reshuffle was not a solution to the political crisis in the country, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said today an action plan to address political, social and economic problems of the people was the need of the hour.
What we need is a certain action plan to address peoples aspirations within a certain time frame. We are not satisfied with a change of Cabinet. There should be an immediate action plan to resolve burning issues such as the issues of the people hit by the drought, he said.
He told a news conference organised by the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) that all forces that participated in setting up the Good Governance government in January, 2015 should be re-united to fulfil the promises made to the people.
Mr. Ranawaka said the government should take steps to address shortcoming of the government such as the delay in taking action against the wrong-doers and the disappointment caused to the people due to this.
We are of the opinion that some crucial political reforms are necessary for this. The first thing is to formulate an action plan agreeable to both factions of the government and implement it. The action plan to be fulfilled within next three months and within 18 months should be identified and it should be turned into the programme to address peoples burning issues such as drinking water, drought, fertilizer issue and a proper programme to provide the Samurdhi allowance, he said.
He said if such an action plan was not presented by anyone, the JHU would take the lead and discuss with other forces to formulate an action plan. (Ajith Siriwardana)

## Title: Its a bird;  its a plane. No its a drone

Its a bird;  its a plane. No its a drone
	
Drones are evolving into poor mans precision guided munition
On January 6, 2018, a milestone in asymmetric warfare occurred in Syria. A Russian Air Force detachment at Khmeimim Air Base and at the Tartus Naval station came under attack from a swarm of drones.
It is believed that up to 13 drones were used for these two attacks making it an unprecedented use of drone airpower by a non-State actor.
There may have been several other unsuccessful attacks using drones in the same week, however, the exact number of attacks is disputed.
Analysts of the Russian Ministry of Defence revealed at a press conference that the drones were guided by using GPS and could have been launched from up to 100km away.
The Russian Ministry of Defence claimed that several drones were detected and shot down and displayed two samples they had recovered.
According to Janes Defence Weekly, rebels had claimed that they have destroyed and damaged several Russian aircraft at Khmeimim. However, in a press release, the Russian MoD denied any losses or damage due to the incident.
TASS, the Russian News Agency, quoted the press release Engineering solutions used by terrorists when attacking Russian facilities in Syria could have been received only from a country with high technological potential on providing satellite navigation and distant control of firing competently assembled self-made explosive devices in appointed place which is a sign of the growing tensions between the USA and Russia.
Both Russia and the USA support, supply and train different fractions waging war in Syria. However, contrary to claim by the Russian MoD on the GPS technology, such GPS based navigation technology has been available in the civilian market for many years.
The use of drones by insurgent groups and terrorists is a growing trend in the Iraq-Syria conflict zone during the past few years.
The Islamic State (ISIS) and other groups such as Hezbollah and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham have been known to use drones for their activities in the past and continue to do so today.
The proliferation of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) technologies, ease of access to commercially available components, availability of commercial drones and recreational craft is viewed as a concern by Janes Terrorism and Insurgency Centre (JTIC).
The number of Airborne Improvised Explosive Devices (ABIEDs) have been increasing since the start of the Syrian war and have been used in Iraq as well.
According to JTIC and other sources, drones have mostly been used for reconnaissance, fire correction and to strike ground targets with small munitions or IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices).
The use of drones offers insurgents unprecedented tactical advantages to coordinate attacks and gather intelligence, especially in urban environments. Further, imagery captured by drones make valuable propaganda material for groups like ISIS, who rely heavily on online visual content for recruitment.

ISIS is believed to be the most prolific user of drones up to now. Most of the drones used in Iraq and Syria by non-State actors have been commercial Quad Copters, most of which are small enough to be carried and used by one individual. Multi-rotor platforms have also been used by different fractions. The quadcopter configuration offers a stable slow and low altitude platform and comes with easy to master controls, real-time video downlink and simple navigation systems.
When used for aerial attack, quadcopters often used with small airdropped IEDs (ABIEDs).
The Quadcopters ability to hover over a target offers relatively good accuracy, making them ideal for non-State actors who can purchase online at a low cost.
The most frequently found ABIEDs have been made of 30mm or 40mm grenade launcher ammunition with an improvised tail-fin assembly. The ISIS is also known to have designed and manufactured in numbers, several types of AIEDs, projectile bombs and related fuses in Syria.
However, according to military analyst Nick Waters, the ABIEDs recovered after the Khmeimim attack may be specifically built for a drone-borne attack.
The downed drones displayed by the Russian MoD indicate that they were purpose built.
Designed in a conventional aircraft (fixed wing) configuration and powered by a small diesel engine, it is clear that this drone was designed to have greater range and higher payload capacity.
These facts indicate that the Khmeimim Air Force Base attack was a progression in the tactics of drone-borne ABIED use by a non-state actor.
Further, the use of commonly available off the shelf components make it difficult to track its origins and builders, adding a layer of deniability to the drone user.

	It is believed that up to 13 drones were used for these two attacks...
	
	
	Threats to critical infrastructure, aviation and soft targets are a significant security concern.
	
	
	Nations are enacting smart regulatory practices regarding the sale and use of commercial, recreational drones
	
	
	It is important that Sri Lankan security policymakers pay attention to the evolving threat landscape

Fixed wing drones, which have been used by groups in Iraq-Syria for the past few years, but fewer in number than the prolific quadcopter and multirotor variants.
There have been reports of Drones and ABIED being used in the ongoing civil wars in Yemen and Libya. The United States of America in December 2017, has used a recovered drone amongst other exhibits as evidence for alleged Iranian state sponsoring of Yemeni rebel and terrorist groups. Laura Seal, a US Defence Department Spokesperson referred to the Qasef-1, UAS an ABIED Kamikaze style drone which had been recovered from Houthi groups by the Saudi Forces. Seal claimed that Only Iran makes the Qasef-1. It is a member of the Ababil UAV family, designed and produced by the Iranian government. Due to such claims, it is prudent to expect that more sophisticated UAS technology and more advanced types of drones may be fielded by non  state actors in the future.
Drones such as the Qasef-1, give non-state actors a degree of stand-off range precision strike capabilities which were previously only available to Government forces. In 2017, the US Army awarded a contract worth USD $16 million to develop and field a mobile Counter-UAS (C-UAS) system for the US Army by 2018. Therefore, the security threats posed by drones as an asymmetric threat are very much a concern for security planners and practitioners around the world. The increasing sophistication of such ABIEDs and drones used indicates that they are on an evolutionary path to becoming a more common insurgent  terrorist tool in the coming years.
Off the battlefield, drone-borne threats to critical infrastructure, aviation and soft targets are a significant security concern.

In 2014, drones breaching restricted airspace above several nuclear power plants caused the French authorities to introduce several measures to counter illegal drone intrusions over critical infrastructure and defence related sites.
Last year, a drone flown by an amateur photographer, landed on the latest British aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth while she was in Port.
In 2015, a drone carrying radioactive sand landed on the Japanese Prime Ministers residence.
Police later arrested a man who had intended to protest against Japans Nuclear energy policies with the drone landing. Such acts demonstrate that Drones or UASs can be used to deliver small Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) payloads. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released a document on Critical Infrastructure security where it notes that drones can be a significant security threat to national security and the potential for drone use in an attack was on the rise.

Internationally, nations are enacting smart regulatory practices regarding the sale and use of commercial drones and recreational drones while the military  security establishments are actively researching and fielding robust Counter  UAS (CUAS) systems. Utility services networks such as the national power grid, water distribution system and filtration plants, telecommunication networks, ports and oil refineries are key to maintain the economy running smoothly. It is important that Sri Lankan security policymakers pay attention to the evolving threat landscape, especially in relation to critical infrastructure protection.
I have discussed Sri Lankas drone regulatory structure, security and safety concerns, drone detection and possible countermeasures in my commentary on the topic which can be read at http://www.insssl.lk/preview.phpid=79.
The need for greater awareness amongst the security establishment, research and smart regulation is timely

Janashakthi Delivers Sustained Double Digit Growth through FY 2017
	
Mr. Prakash Schaffter, Managing Director  Janashakthi Insurance PLC
Registering steady double digit growth in premiums through FY 2017, Janashakthi Insurance PLC (Janashakthi) posted a consolidated Gross Written Premium (GWP) of Rs. 15.115 billion for the twelve months ended 31st December 2017, a commendable year on year (YoY) growth of 11%. The Non-Life or General Insurance business grew by 14% to end the year with a GWP of Rs. 12.212 billion, while the Life Insurance business remained flat, recording a GWP of Rs. 2.903 billion.
Paying out claims to the total of Rs. 7.317 billion during the period under review, Janashakthi continued to uphold its commitment to standing by its policyholders during times of distress. The more than 9% YoY increase in claims settlements was a result of the rise in the number of flood-related fire and engineering claims, as well as a spike in medical claims due to the dengue epidemic. Stringent cost management practices allowed the insurer to keep overhead expenses under control, which reduced by 1% YoY.
Janashakthi Insurance PLC reported its consolidated full year results for the final time, as the Company recently entered into an agreement with Allianz SE to sell 100% of its fully owned subsidiary Janashakthi General Insurance Limited. Speaking on the Companys performance, Managing Director, Mr. Prakash Schaffter stated,I am delighted to report that we have ended FY 2017 on a high note, with premium inflows continuing to grow through the year. We have been able to maintain our steady growth momentum despite a considerable rise in claim settlements thanks to our strong fundamentals and prudent reinsurance structure. The year 2018 will be a year of change resulting from the divestment of the Non-Life business. We are optimistic that the opportunities arising from a singular focus on theLife Insurance business, coupled with the opportunity of rebuilding an efficient distribution system, will strengthen our presence in the Sri Lankan Life Insurance industry.
The total Consolidated Assets of the company grew by 15% YoY, standing at Rs. 36.848 billion at the end of the period under review with the investment portfolio accounting for Rs. 25.523 billion of this value. Prudent management of investments helped Janashakthi register Rs. 451 million or a 23% growth in investment income which propelled Other Revenue to Rs. 3.159 billion.
The transaction between Janashakthi Insurance PLC and Allianz SE will yield a capital gain in the hands of Janashakthi Insurance PLC and it is expected that the Company would undertake a substantial share buyback as a means of transferring capital back into the hands of shareholders. The transaction and the buyback of shares are subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, and are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2018.
The Board of Directors of Janashakthi Insurance PLC comprises Mr. Husein Esufally, Chairman; Mr. Prakash Schaffter, Managing Director; Mr. Jude Fernando; Mr. Stuart Chapman; Mr. Ramesh Schaffter, Mr. L. C. R. de C. Wijetunge, Ms. Anushya Coomaraswamy, Mrs. Manjula Mathews, and Mr. Eardley Perera.

Myanmar donate 300 tonnes of rice to Lankan flood victims
	
A ceremony to donate 300 tonnes of rice to Sri Lankas flood victims was held by the government and the Myanmar Rice Federation (MRF) on 24 February at Pinlekoethwe rice mill in Dagon Seikkan Indistrial Zone, the Global New Light of Myanmar reported today.
Dr Than Myint, Union Minister for the Commerce Ministry, and other officials, along
with Mr. K.W.N.D Karunaratne, Sri Lankas Ambassador to Myanmar, and officials from the MRF attended the event.
The donation is a humanitarian aid for victims of the flood and landslide in May 2017, which killed more than 200 people and rendered 600,000 homeless.
The MRF donated some 300 tonnes of rice with an estimated value of more than US$150,000, while the government will pay the cost of shipment charges to Sri Lanka from the Yangon port.
Sri Lanka and Myanmar are engaged in cultural and religious cooperation. Sri Lanka
buys rice and other agricultural products from Myanmar, and so, they are our trading clients. Therefore, we would like to express our concern to our trading partner with our contribution, said U Ye Min Aung, general secretary of MRF.
The low quality rice (15 per cent broken rice of the Ae-Ma-Hta variety) will be purified. The shipment started yesterday, and is slated to reach Sri Lankas port in early March.
Myanmar donors will offer more donations in Sri Lanka in mid-March. Dr Than Myint said that Sri Lanka and Myanmar were engaged in economic, social and cultural exchanges during the old days.
There is business- to-business cooperation, besides a government-to-government agreement. Bilateral trade with Sri Lanka reached $36 million, and the volume will grow each year, he added. Sri Lankas ambassador noted that the country imported rice from Myanmar, Thailand and India owing to a shortage of rice due to floods in the rainy season.
I would like to express our appreciation, on behalf of the Sri Lankan people, for the humanitarian aid supported by Myanmars government and the MRF. We will make sure the contributions go directly and effectively to the flood victims.
Earlier, Myanmar and Sri Lanka had a series of discussions for rice exports under the
government-to-government system. Sri Lanka has now allowed importers to import the goods with zero tax, and so, the plan turned out to be a business- to-business plan.

No foreign kidneys transplants in SL: Rajitha
	
The Health Ministry has suspended kidney transplants in Sri Lanka with kidneys obtained from foreigners and also requests private hospitals not to charge any fee from those who come forward to donate organs or pay for their organs, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
The Minister added that these decisions were taken following the controversy surrounding the selling of kidneys by Indians for kidney transplant surgeries conducted in a private hospital in Sri Lanka in the recent past.
Addressing a ceremony held before the start of a Walk to Promote Donation of Human Organs organized by the Sri Jayewardenepura Teaching Hospital (SJTH), Minister Senaratne said he would declare a relief package for donors of human organs and life long treatment package for them from the government hospitals.
I am glad to observe that Sri Lanka has shown a steady progress in human organ transplants. The dedicated and highly professional surgeons in our country have successfully transplanted livers, kidneys, hearts and other organs with limited facilities. If our doctors have similar facilities found in US, UK, Japan or Singapore, I have no doubt that they would do a better job second to none. I have decided to provide all modern medical equipment, drugs and other facilities to bring human organ transplants in Sri Lanka to the level of any developed country, Minister Senaratne stressed.
Minister Senaratne said he had instructed Director General, Health Services Dr. Anil Jasinghe to study the organ transplant policy in Singapore and to see whether Sri Lanka could use it as a guide to prepare a National Organ Transplant Policy (NOTP) for Sri Lanka. If and when a NOTP was enacted the ban on performing organ transplants using organs from foreign donors would be lifted.
Minister Senaratne lamented that the first ever heart transplant surgery performed at the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital (PTH) in July 2017 was a complete success but the second heart transplant surgery was unsuccessful due to a tug of war between two groups of surgeons and added that compassion, love and dedication were vital qualities a doctor must be rich with if his or her treatment heals a patient.
Organ transplants were performed in Sri Lanka at the moment at the Colombo National Hospital, SJTH, PTH, Karapitya Teaching Hospital, Kandy General Hospital and Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital. Several other leading hospitals will be equipped shortly to perform transplant surgeries shortly, he said and appealed doctors not to disrupt it for their benefit. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

SAITM students warn of uproars
	
The Student Action Committee of SAITM today warned of uproars if they were left out of options to get their issues addressed by the authorities.
Convener Shanaka De Saram said it appeared that the government only listen to university students with aggressive behaviour, and therefore SAITM students too would consider such action.
Addressing a press conference, Mr. De Saram said that it welcomed the Governments decision to transfer the SAITM students to the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) but should enrol all the SAITM students to it.
He said that although several committees were appointed to resolve the SAITM controversy non of them had asked their opinion when making the decisions, therefore its students had been severely mistreated over several years and had to do their studies with many difficulties.
Mr. De Saram said around 900 students were currently receiving their education from SAITM and all of them were enrolled with the relevant approvals of the University Grant Commission (UGC) and the Higher Education Ministry.
He said that the association stand with the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) claims of sending qualified students to KDU as to what he repeatedly confirmed that all the SAITM students were qualified and approved by the UGC.
Our only fear is whether the government would adopt any new regulations when awarding the degree despite what it had promised. If our students were continually pressured, SAITM students would have to resort to aggressive activities to gain its demands, he added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

SF Law and Order Minister in two weeks: Rajitha
	
Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne today said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had accepted the Ministry of Law and Order only for two weeks, and that Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka would be given the portfolio afterwards.
He revealed this during a meeting held at the Health Ministry this morning.
The Minister said someone who is clever and makes strict decisions should be appointed as the Law and Order Minister.
Those who make double deals are not suitable for this post. Though higher-rankers in the Police Department are against the appointment of Mr. Fonseka, lower level officers are on board. Sarath Fonseka is a war-hero. Those who boasted about war heroes should accept that. The personnel, who robbed and killed, had also been venerated as war-heroes today. Ministerial portfolios are not forever. Those who are wavering should be removed from the Cabinet. The Cabinet cannot be finalized to satisfy the wants of Ministers. Appropriate decisions should be taken by the President and the Prime Minister and not by political parties, he said.
Responding to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa who has said that the cabinet reshuffle was a comedy, Minister Senaratne said Mr. Rajapaksa used to reshuffle the Cabinet to teach a lesson to ministers.
Even some ministers had expressed different opinions over the reshuffle. They may make such statements when they are not given what they expected, he said. (Sujith Hewajulige)

We need parliamentary election without delay
	
Nationalist Movement activist Gevindu Cumaratunga,
in an interview with the Daily Mirror, analysed the current political situationin the country. He shared the following:-
	LG election formula made a serious assault on democracy
	
	
	Peoples verdict is against Yahapalana conspirators
	
	
	It is a verdict against Govt ridiculing national conscience
	

How do you rate the recent election results
Like the British colonial rulers crippled village leadership of our country after the Kandyan rebellion, the present Government undermined the local leadership after assuming office in 2015. The Government delayed the local elections for three years and denied village level political leadership to people. Today, people have elected to office the political activist, the political party that struggled against such denial. Also, people got the opportunity to compare and contrast the three-year rule of this Government with the government of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. People have overwhelmingly rejected the policies of the current rule. Also, people expressed their firm objection to what this Government intends to do  alienation of national assets, ETCA agreement with India, separatist constitutional reforms etc.
As we see it, this is also a verdict against the Government ridiculing national conscience. In fact, this Government took steps to sing the Buddhist devotional song Danno Budunge in opera style, at the Independence Day celebrations. The Prime Minister came out to insult the original version. Then they made a mess of our national anthem. There cannot be a national anthem which is sung after an event and another before the event. For a nation, there cannot be two separate national anthems. In constitutional reform proposals, there were serious assaults on the national identity of this country. The Government pursued the same harmful policy of insulting and harassing war heroes and Buddhist monks.
As in 1956, people have spoken out at this election against these shameful, harmful acts. They have demanded a new leadership, a new path for the country.

"Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa emerged as an iconic figure as he gave leadership to the war against scourge of terrorism that threatened our motherland. He stood up to reactionary forces in certain sections of the international community"
Yet, the Govt maintains that the total amount of votes polled collectively by the political parties that stood together at the last Presidential Election is much higher than the total votes polled by SLPP. How do you view it
This argument will be valid only if all these forces contested together under one banner. Or if all these parties  UNP, SLFP, UPFA, JVP, and TNA were upholding the actions of the past 3 years, they were asking for a mandate to continue together. As we know, not only did they contest separately SLFP and UPFA led by President and JVP were asking for a mandate against the present Government policies. UNP also was asking for a mandate to form a pure UNP Government. If they contested as a front under a common symbol and asked for the peoples verdict on their performance during the past three years, this argument will hold some water. It did not happen that way.What did the President say He said the way the economy was handled by the UNP was a total failure. He said people were reeling under the high cost of living. He sought a mandate from the people to change the economic policies. He asked for a mandate to secure national assets. He asked for a mandate to punish Bond thieves. So, the majority of the 13% votes polled by combined SLFP plus UPFA is a protest vote against the policies of this so-called national Government.
We heard JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake expressing the view that the SLPP failed to poll more than 50%. We ask whether the JVP got votes in favour of selling national assets Whether they got votes in favour of this governments economic policies Whether they got votes in favour of signing of the ETCA with India If so, the 6% they polled can be considered as an endorsement of the present Government policies. If not, that 6% also has to be considered as a protest vote against this Government. The JVP should spell it out clearly.
SLPP polled 44.6%. The UPFA/SLFP got 13.38%. The JVP 6%. That is a total of 63%. It is a huge percentage against the performance of the Prime Minister. It is a protest vote against the policies of the current Government. It is a protest vote against the so-called National Government. So, the Prime Minister should step down. Party leaders should get together and form a caretaker Government. People should be given an opportunity to form a new Government according to their wishes.

"The constitutional amendments, brought about by this Government, created confusion within confusion in administration. It is an attempt to prevent the formation of a stable Government in Sri Lanka"
Yet, this election is seen merely as something meant for the selection of members for local administration. How do you respond to that argument
If so, why do they argue about national percentages now Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) won more than 70% of local bodies. It is a landslide victory gained after weathering all odds placed in its way by the present rule. Yahapalana pundits should be humble enough to accept the peoples verdict.
At the same time this election cannot be considered only as a Local Government Election. Not only SLPP, UNP, SLFP-UPFA and JVP all parties asked people to exercise their franchise considering national policies; national leadership. We find newspaper advertisements placed by the UNP asking for a mandate based on its performance during the past three years. They said the vote for the UNP is a vote for your future. In this advertisement, nothing is mentioned about matters related to local administration. The SLFP/UPFA also carried out paid advertisements asking for a mandate for the Presidents leadership; to punish bond fraudsters; to safeguard national assets. Again, these are matters of national significance. The JVP also teamed up with NGO elements and sought a mandate for a new beginning; for a turning point of national politics. So all parties, in this manner, asked people to vote considering issues of national significance; national leadership. However, people rejected the policies of all these parties and chose the newly formed SLPP instead. Nobody can deny the fact that this is an election of national significance.

	Polls outcome impacted PMs performence
	
	
	SLPP emerge victors in more than 70% of the local bodies
	
	
	TNA polled 339,675 against 515,963 at 2015 Parliamentary elections
	
	
	Polls outcome a big blow to conspirators against a unitary Sri Lanka
	
UNP polled 5,098,927 at the 2015 Parliamentary Elections. In this February 10 elections, it polled only 3,625,510. After governing the country for 3 years and Ranil Wickremesinghe being Prime Minister for 3 years, they have lost 1,473, 417 votes! SLFP-UPFA led by President Sirisena polled 4,732,669 at the 2015 Parliamentary Elections. In this February 10 elections SLFP-UPFA collectively polled 1,487,960 only. So under the Presidents leadership SLFP-UPFA has lost 3,244,709 votes! Shouldnt the President, Prime Minister and their collective Government resign Not only should they resign from public office, they should resign from the leaderships of the respective parties. 515,963 votes at the 2015 Parliamentary elections. The TNA has also lost a lot of votes. They polled 515,963 votes at the 2015 Parliamentary elections. This February 10th they polled only 339,675. They have lost 176,228 votes. One of my Tamil friends told me that the votes they received this time represented the correct figure; the amount they have lost  which is more than one hundred and seventy five thousand was the amount they rigged (hora chanda) at the 2015 parliamentary elections! Explanation is due from the TNA leadership, who is shamelessly holding on to the Opposition leaders post.

"UNP polled 5,098,927 at the 2015 Parliamentary Elections. In this February 10 elections, it polled only 3,625,510. After governing the country for 3 years and Ranil Wickremesinghe being Prime Minister for 3 years, they have lost 1,473, 417 votes!"
You work against the Constitution making process of this Government. The Government has been defeated at the local elections, so, do you think it is a blow to the constitution making process as well
Its a blow to the conspirators against a unitary Sri Lanka. Its a victory for the Motherland.
The Government was taking many steps that were disastrous to the country. People have spoken out clearly against them. We wonder whether the Government would shelve such harmful measures now after the electoral defeat or proceed with them hoodwinking the masses. This week, the Government started the latest round of talks on ETCA to finalize the process. Where are the champions of good governance Where are the NGO pundits who teach us about governing according to peoples wishes Where are the Western ambassadors who are ever willing to teach us about the value of democracy
We regret to see some Buddhist monks even belittling the significance of this election and asking the President and the Prime Minister to proceed as usual.Ever in the history, this is the first time people voted against the Government at a local poll. The religious dignitaries, especially Buddhist monks, and the intelligentsia should view this election results with due seriousness and prevail upon the rulers to act accordingly. They should ask leaders of this so-called national government to stop their harmful acts immediately. They should ask them to step down and pave the way for General Elections, so that people can choose a new government, new leadership according to their wishes.
Do you see whether the SLPP should have a departure from its past policies
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa emerged as an iconic figure as he gave leadership to the war against scourge of terrorism that threatened our motherland. He stood up to reactionary forces in certain sections of the international community. We have to deal with the international community regardless of whatever party is in office. People hold him in high esteem over his action to protect sovereignty of Sri Lanka. He also appeared for the protection of Sri Lankas national assets. In business, some make profits, some make losses. Then you have to face criticism. Yet, the Rajapaksa administration didnt take the easy option of selling or disowning of national assets.
Driven by westerns attitudes and funding, no one has done a proper study into innovative development works undertaken during the Rajapaksa rule. People always talked about mega development projects. Yet, we have to consider the projects such as Divineguma, Gamaneguma and Maganeguma. There were many local level projects which enabled families with new income avenues, which uplifted the life of the villager. As for the road network, the villages that remained cut-off were linked with the towns and cities. They were opened up from isolation. No one has done proper academic study on these matters. We should proceed with such development work.
We defeated the LTTE under MRs leadership. Yet, it could not be recognized in the constitution. During his second term, we could not transform our country in line with this great victory. Thats what the SLPP should thrive to achieve.

"Government delayed the local elections for three years and denied village level political leadership to people. Today, people have elected to office the political activist, the political party that struggled against such denial"
As the professional front/national front linked with SLPP, what do you plan to do to topple this Government
First, the Prime Minister and Government should resign. We need a parliamentary election without any delay.
The constitutional amendments, brought about by this Government, created confusion within confusion in administration. It is an attempt to prevent the formation of a stable Government in Sri Lanka. Not only at the national level, local Government as well as provincial councils have been made a waste by this Government and their backers.
The new electoral system, introduced under the leadership of MP Dinesh Gunawardane, was supposed to elect 70% under the ward system and the rest under Proportional Representation.Then, people would have more say in these councils as 70% were chosen directly by them. Also, the councils would have got clear, stable leadership. These Yahapalana racketeers changed it to be 60% for wards and 40% for proportional representation. This new formula introduced by this Government has created confusion. The party that won even eight out of ten wards cannot form a stable administration. With more members elected, with more cost to the people, yet without leadership! Yet, without usefulness!!This is an affront to democracy.
The worst will happen to the provincial councils. For them, thanks to the Yahapalana coalition led by JVP and Muslim Congress tribal leadership, the formula is 50-50. Even if a party wins all the electorates, in some councils it will not get a clear majority. Until it is corrected, there is no use of conducting elections in the provincial councils.
So, we agitate for correcting these Yahapalana sins; for a new parliament; for a new leadership.
