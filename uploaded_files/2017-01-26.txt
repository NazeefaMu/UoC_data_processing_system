Automobile market collapses by over 40%
	
Automobile trade in Sri Lanka is facing extreme difficulties due to the recent regulations introduced by the government, the former chairman of the Ceylon Motor Traders Association (CMTA) Gihan Pilapitiya said yesterday.
?The overall showroom traffic had dropped more than 40 per cent and even most of these customers who walk in, go away without purchasing due to high pricing. In some cases certain vehicle showrooms have no customer visits at all in a day? he said.
?Last week?s leasing regulations announced by the Government for vehicles based on loan-to-value ratio, as proposed in the 2017 budget is another blow to sustainability of the trade.
?If leasing companies are ready to provide facilities and the buyer is agreeable with the settlement, there is no need for the Government intervention, to artificially regulate the trade? .
In addition to this it is also important that the decision makers figure out the cost of maintaining old vehicles and their environmental impact as well before policies are formulated. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Ayurvedic medicines in sports: are they performance boosters?
	
?
Since ancient times Ayurveda has been used to cure various ailments. However, in the present day and age, its use has been deemed dangerous to sportsmen due to the lack of monitoring of the ingredients that go into the preparation of Ayurvedic medicines. Cases of sportsmen who were tested positive for performance enhancing drugs after receiving Ayurvedic treatment sprung up last year, prompting the Sri Lanka Anti-Doping Agency (SLADA) to start preparations on running tests on such medicines. Nevertheless, Ayurvedic professors stand by their practice and deny the fact that harmful substances are included in the medication and claim that their natural ingredients are the the safest and most effective type of treatment. ??
?
Our general advise to sportsmen is to avoid Ayurvedic medicines as much as possible?
- Prof. Arjuna de SilvaChairman of the SLADA?
Professor Arjuna de Silva, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Anti-Doping Agency, said that although the rubbing oil and massaging in Ayurvedic treatment is acceptable it is dangerous for a sportsperson to take Ayurvedic medicine for many reasons. First of all we do not know what exactly goes into these medicines. Secondly, you can get contaminated and also banned substances in these medicines and be open to doping allegations.? ??
He added,?The problem with Ayurvedic medicine is that there is no indication of what goes into its production. Unlike in Western medicine users are not made aware of side effects of Ayurvedic medicines. Since anti doping has become a big issue our general advise to sportsmen is to avoid Ayurvedic medicines as much as possible.? ??
Professor de Silva confirmed the occurrence of cases where sportsmen were tested positive for performance enhancing substances after receiving Ayurvedic treatment. ??
Confirming the reports that tests run on Ayurvedic medicine used by sportsmen are being planned, Professor de Silva said, ?We are waiting to get the equipment needed. As soon as it is received we will begin running the tests to check whether performance enhancing or banned substances are present in Ayurvedic medicines.? ??
Speaking of the awareness measures taken on the subject, he said,?Through islandwide education, media and advertising we are spreading awareness on the types of medication sportsmen should avoid. And through educating sports doctors we ensure they are directed to take the proper medicine.? ??
He added that Ayurvedic treatment is quite widely sought out by sportsmen more so in athletics than in cricket. ??
Professor de Silva encourages people with any doubts to contact SLADA or visit their website adding that there are plans to establish a hot line this year in order to provide people to have a place to contact with their questions 24 hours a day.?
?
?Some herbs in injury treatment have the ability to enhance performance. But they are not mixed into medicines given to sportsman?
- Prof. Pushpakumar Amerasinghe ?Senior Lecturer at the Gampaha Wickramarachchi Ayurveda Institute, University of Kelaniya
?
According to Professor Amarasinghe, Ayurveda greatly contributes towards the well being of sportsmen, ?For example, in the prevention of sports injuries, enhancement of nutrition, in the improvement of psychological issues in [performance] there are many natural herbs available to Ayurvedic physicians. There are other herbs which can be used to increase energy levels and help in stress management.? ??
?The use of Ayurvedic treatment is complex. And they are administered depending on the type of situation or injury faced by the patient. A special kind of body-type identification , called prakruti, is done and according to the body type of a person specific herbs are selected in the treatment. Before giving medication for injury prevention a sportsman?s dietary habits are observed and exercises such as yoga are advised in order to keep them mentally fit.? ??
He went on to say that Ayurveda is improving in Sri Lanka as there are degrees and special courses available in the field. He cited the BSc Special Degree Programme in Sports Science conducted at the Jayewardenepura University as an example. ??
Expressing his opinion on the suspicions directed towards banned substances in Ayurvedic drugs given to sportsmen, Professor Amarasinghe said,?There are many types of herbs available such as ginseng and ashwagandha, tibulus terretis and other combinations of herbs to treat injuries some of which have the ability to enhance performance levels. However, such herbs are not mixed into medicines given to sportsman. In Ayurvedic preparations there are no artificial chemicals or western medicines included. Sportsmen who seek Ayurvedic treatment also follow other treatments and take medicines that are commercially available. ??
Thus, when tests are run on such athletes, they are tested positive for performance enhancing substances. And the blame falls on Ayurvedic medicines. Ayurvedic medicine is not harmful but it could be harmful if taken with other medications or stimulants.? ??
He also said that Ayurvedic the medicines can be easily investigated as there is full transparency with the ingredients that go into them. ?

BOOK REVIEW - He?s done it again!
	
?Soaring Spirits and Shooting Stars?, the second book to be published in the year 2016, by author Lakshman Ratnapala, is as interesting and evocative as his first book ?Flickering Fortunes?, published in February of the same year ?
?
? ?This second book contains primarily pen portraits of fourteen men who have had a significant impact on the author?s life. Among them are a number of the author?s colleagues from PATA and the world of Tourism who have chapters of their own. It is an eclectic collection of subjects that Mr Ratnapala has dealt with, here. ?
The novelist Joseph Conrad has written that the task of a writer ?is, by the power of the written word to make you hear, to make you feel - it is, before all, to make you see. That - and no more - and it is everything.? Mr Ratnapala?s biographical writings have done just this. Just as his first book helped the reader not just to engage with the life of the subject but also of the subject?s times and seasons, so this second book will also serve this purpose. ?
The great British Historian G. M. Trevelyan in his ?Autobiography of an Historian? from An Autobiography and Other Essays writes ?The dead were and are not. Their place knows them no more and is ours today...The poetry of history lies in the quasi-miraculous fact that once, on this earth, once, on this familiar spot of ground, walked other men and women, as actual as we are today, thinking their own thoughts, swayed by their own passions, but now all gone, one generation vanishing into another, gone as utterly as we ourselves shall shortly be gone, like ghosts at cockcrow.? A study of the lives and times of men and women of the past help us to realize that we are all part of a grand design; that we will get some things right as did our forebears and we will definitely get some things wrong just as they did. ?
Although characteristically, as in his first book, Lakshman R., does not pull his punches, he treats his subjects with respect and with a sense of humour that is by no means irreverent. However, he is guilty of betraying his loyalties to his heroes! But then most biographers do tend to treat their subjects ?subjectively?! There is perhaps a fine line between biography and hagiography that is the uncritical and even reverential description of a subject?s life.?
?Trevelyan has identified that ?bias? is very ?much a part of the historical biographer?s weakness. And so, Mr Ratnapala?s pen portraits of some of his heroes can be described as having been written in similar vein. ?
Reading through ?Soaring Spirits and Shooting Stars? I have been struck by the fact that the author has remembered so many details about people, places and events. It is obvious that he paid attention to the little things and made a note of the details. In a fast-moving world like ours we would benefit by remembering the small things and the little details for at the end of the day it is perhaps these things that matter. ?
Mr Ratnapala shows us also the value of remembering, the value of respect for people both great and small. This shows us that we all need mentors, people we can look up to and respect and seek to emulate and be inspired by for our own journey through life. It shows us the value of heroes ? men and women who stood for the right kind of public opinion and principles whose courage, integrity and lifestyle continue to inspire. Someone has said ?Next to doing things that deserve to be written, nothing gets a man more credit, or gives him more pleasure than to write things that deserve to be read.? These pen portraits deserved to have been written and certainly deserve to be read! ?

## Title: Cabinet to legalise abortions under crucial circumstances

Cabinet to legalise abortions under crucial circumstances
	
?
?
The ?rights of a woman? has always been a topic of discussion in not only Asian countries but around the world as well. Although much progress has been made over the past few decades, women still remain a vulnerable group in society faced with unpleasant encounters such as sexual violence, molestation and abuse. The concept of abortions has often been subjected to much debate when considering the ethical implications. ??
The strict criminalization of abortion or termination of pregnancies except to save the life of a mother as contained in the Penal Code of Sri Lanka has been identified as detrimental to the mental and physical well being of the woman. Giving an opportunity for women to access safe and legal abortion procedures in certain identified circumstances is a matter that has been spoken about. ??
As this matter has raised concerns amongst some, the ?spoke to a few individuals in varied fields of interest. ??
Existing legal framework in Sri Lanka
As stated in an Interim report of the Special Committee on amending the Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the Penal Code recognises the act of causing a miscarriage and the termination of pregnancy as an offence except as necessary in circumstances which endanger the life of the mother. ??
Section 303 reads :
?Whoever voluntarily causes a woman with child to miscarry shall, if such miscarriage be not caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman, be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with both; and if the woman be quick with child, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.? ??
Section 304 reads :
?Whoever commits the offence defined in the last preceding section without the consent of the woman, whether the woman is quick with child or not, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 20 years and shall also be liable to fine.? ??
Section 305 states :
?Whoever, with intent to cause the miscarriage of a woman with child, does any act which causes the death of such woman, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to twenty years, and shall also be liable to fine.? ??
Section 306 reads :
?Whoever, before the birth of any child, does any act with the intention of preventing that child from being born alive, or causing it to die after its birth, and does by such act prevent that child from being born alive, or causes it to die after its birth, shall, if such act be not caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the mother, be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or with both.? ??
?
?
Proposed Recommendations
Based on the preceding findings, the Committee makes the following recommendations : ??
To decriminalise abortion and allow for medical termination of pregnancies in the specific circumstances of : ??
a) Rape and incest ??
b) The pregnancy occurring in a girl below the age of 16 (a victim of statutory rape) ??
c) Serious foetal impairment ??
To provide for a procedure for medical termination of pregnancies on one of the above grounds that will be rigorously regulated in order to prevent the abuse of?
the process ??
To enact/amend legislation as appropriate to facilitate the inclusion of the above provisions. ??
?
?
?We went through a long process in acquainting the concerns??
Dr.Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe
Speaking to the?Dailymirror, Justice Minister Dr.Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said that he is positive about?
this decision.?
?We consulted the opinions of a panel of experts representing the medical, religious and other fields.?
Through this we are trying to save the life of the mother under three circumstances.?
I don?t think there will be much challenges since we went through a long process in acquainting the concerns. In another three weeks? time we will be presenting this proposal in Parliament.? ?
?
?A woman?s right to reproductive health is hers and hers alone??
Visakha Tillekeratne
?
In her comments, women?s rights activist and Co-convener of Citizens for a secure Sri Lanka, VisakhaTillekeratne said that if the mother wasm a child, abortion should be done as early as two months. ?It is up to the mother to decide what to do with her life and no other party, that is the family, spouse or doctor could force her to do an abortion.?
When I was born in Russia, abortions were not a new thing in that country. Anybody could go and do one. But here there is less coverage and awareness. This should start at school level and expand to reach out to the masses. After all, the woman?s right to reproductive health is hers and hers alone.? ?
?
?Stringent laws would encourage mothers to do illegal abortions leading to fatal results ??
Thushara Ranasinghe?
Executive Director of the Family Planning Association, Thushara Ranasinghe said that the Sri Lankan Penal Code on abortion is quite archaic. ?We cannot move forward with archaic laws because they may not suit the prevailing circumstances.?
We hear a lot about sexual violence and an abortion would be the obvious choice in most instances. Therefore relaxing the laws would give them a chance to get rid of some burden. In addition to that there are instances when there are foetal impairments and again due to the law the gynaecologist cannot allow the patient to have an abortion.?
The life of the mother should be preserved and there is a debate about pro-life versus pro-choice. The bad side of imposing stringent laws is that it gives a chance for the mothers to do illegal abortions which could lead to fatal results. Most illegal abortions are not properly monitored and mothers have a high risk of losing their fertility as well.? ??
?
?
?Legalisation of abortions under special circumstances is a bit of a way forward ???
Dr.Pabasari Ginige
?
Speaking about this issue in detail, senior lecturer at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya and Consultant Psychiatrist at the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital, Dr.Pabasari Ginige said that although the issue of abortions had been discussed on earlier occasions there weren?t many progressive steps taken due to stringent laws. ?When living in a country governed by major religious concepts, we all value life. But as psychiatrists we can?t only be looking at the religion, caste or creed. The life of the unborn as well as the mother are of utmost importance. In my opinion women should have the equal right to do an abortion in Sri Lanka. The family, the government or any other party cannot interfere with her decision. In fact women should have the right of choice ? let it be to get married, have a child, do a job or for any other choice. A woman cannot be irresponsible, get pregnant and then use abortion as a method of contraception.?
Therefore legalisation of abortions under special circumstances is a bit of a way forward.? ? Speaking further she said that there are seven reasons for abortions around the world. ?Abortions are done to save the mother?s life ? this is the only provision which we can use at present, to preserve a woman?s physical health, to preserve a woman?s mental health, due to rape or incest, foetal impairments, economic or social reasons and genetic issues. Also in the case of minors or mentally challenged mothers, the significant other or the family could take a decision as to whether she could undergo an abortion. In the new legislation the concept of abnormal foetuses too is covered. This is a way of showing some respect towards the mother. We also need to spread awareness and educate people on sensitive issues such as these in order to give them?
more insight.? ??

Do not underestimate Sp. Comm. of Inquiry: Lakshman Yapa
	
State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena yesterday requested all the politicians to refrain from underestimating the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate into the controversial Central Bank bond issue.
Minister Abeywardena told a media briefing yesterday that President Maithripala Sirisena has decided to appoint the Commission at the perfect moment and added that the members for the Commission would be appointed next week.
?The President waited so long to appoint the Commission until the debate on the issue commenced in Parliament. He has always taken the correct decision at the correct time,? he said.
He said the appointing of this Commission was an honest effort to resolve this issue and no one has the right to criticize the delay of appointing it.
He said the alleged Central Bank bond issue was an unfortunate incident and it was a crime and a betrayal. He also said as a government they had to re-correct these circumstances.
?We hope this Commission will function in an independent manner to fulfil the people's hope and even we have complete faith on it. This Commission will create a name in history if they would do so,? he said.
Commenting on the government?s decision to gain GSP+ from European Union (EU), he said it was a timely need to increase Export Revenue in the country. He also said the government would have to pay instalments valued at Rs. 3 trillion by 2026.
He said 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2026 will be quite financially disturbed years to the country and added that there was no necessity to hide these facts from people since it was the truth.
?Gaining GSP+ will not risk the native process of the country. Earlier, the country was unable to obtain it with lack of negotiation with the EU. Sri Lanka will almost be a debt-free country after 2026,? he said.
Meanwhile, he said the country could witness a ?Peraliyaka Arambuma? only when the SLFP get united. He also said there was a possibility of it happening. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Israel plans more than 2,500 new settler homes
	
?
Israel announced plans on Tuesday for 2,500 more settlement homes in the occupied West Bank, the second such declaration since U.S. President Donald Trump took office signaling he could be more accommodating toward such projects than his predecessor. ??
A statement from the Israeli Defence Ministry, which administers lands Israel captured in a 1967 war, said the decision was meant to fulfil demand for new housing ?to maintain regular daily life?. Most of the construction, it said, would be in existing settlement blocs that Israel intends to keep under any future peace agreement with the Palestinians. However, a breakdown provided by the prime minister?s office showed large portions of the planned homes would be outside existing blocs. ?
?
Trump spoke by phone on Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On Tuesday, the new president?s chief spokesman refrained from stating a position on the settlement announcement but said the two leaders would discuss settlement building when they meet in Washington next month.?

Legalising homosexuality: Rajitha contradicts President
	
Contradicting a statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday that he threw away the Cabinet paper aimed at legalizing homosexuality, Minister Rajitha Senaratne today told Parliament that there was never such a move.
"There was never a move to legalize homosexually or prostitution," the minister said responding to a question raised by MP Piyal Nishantha this afternoon.
The minister said Cabinet paper was only aimed at ensuring the rights of all Sri Lankans.
?The paper was to ensure that people of different sexual orientation enjoys same rights as others. You must read the Cabinet paper clearly" he told MP Nishantha.
?There was a list of items under sexual orientations and gay people came under one category. Accordingly, gay people will only enjoy rights as others and there is no move to recognize homosexual relationships," he said.
The minister said this when MP Nishantha recalled the statement made by the President on Wednesday.
MP Nishantha then said gay people might use the Cabinet paper as a loop hole to argue that the lifestyle they adopt was legal. (Yohan Perera)

Malik contradicts Rajitha
	
Rejecting claims made by Minister Rajitha Senaratne with regard to the Horana Tyre factory, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said he had informed both the President and the Prime Minister about the investor of the factory well in advance.
?Both the President and the Prime Minister were aware of the investor since I, myself informed them well in advance,? he said.
The minister said two cabinet papers one proposing the land and then giving details of the incentives and other terms were submitted on this project and in addition the project was discussed and endorsed at several meeting of Cabinet Committee on Economic Management.
The statement further read as follows:
The statement that the land was given for Rs.100/- per Acre is incorrect. In fact, the Government Chief Valuer had valued the land at Rs. 170,825,000/- and the investor has agreed to pay the total amount upfront. The Chief Valuer has also indicated that a further Rs. 10,000/- be charged as an annual nominal fee. Further details pertaining to the project are given below.
? The 100 acre land at Horana, Wagawaththa Industrial Zone is a bare undeveloped land undulating in most areas. Based on the technical investigations done by Central Engineering and Consultancy Bureau (CECB), it is noted that the investor has to incur a sum of about Rs.300 to 400 Mn as per the estimate to bring the land to a usable state. The investor claims that around 3m layer of weak soil has to be removed throughout 25 acres of this land.
? BOI is not providing any infrastructure facilities like in other zones- e.g. even the waste Disposal Treatment Plant will be constructed by this investor. Similarly, all internal roads will have to be constructed by the investor.
? Based on valuation of land by Government Chief Valuer ? an upfront payment of Rs. 170Mn is to be paid by investor. Since the project requires a large extent of land, the investor requested the land be leased to him based on the valuation determined by the Chief Valuer on the basis that infrastructure will be provided by him. The said request by the investor was accommodated by us in view of the high value of the investment of the project and the significant contribution expected to the economy particularly linked with the rubber industry.
? BOI should promote investment and if necessary regulations& rules need to be changed to attract investments as the current regulations have failed to bring in investors. The FDI in 2015 was USD 970 Mn and in 2016 it will be around USD 450 Mn.which is extremely low by any standard.
? The total investment of this project is USD 75Mn (Rs 11.25 Bn). The Project will employ around 3000 people. It will add value to the rubber produced in Sri Lanka &convert raw rubber to radial and solid tyres. The annual export earnings will be above USD 125Mn.
? There will also be inward transfer of technology as the Italian company Marangoniis expected to provide the technical know-how to produce tyres and other rubber based products.
? There are similar BOI projects, on BOI owned properties, which have been given on long term lease with an upfront payment & an annual fee is not charged from such projects ? e.g MAS Group given 47 acres on 50 year lease and upfront payment is to be received and no annual fee is charged. This was a well-developed property with buildings and other infrastructure, although major repairs/renovations will have to be undertaken by the investor (former Kabool Lace property).Furthermore, a land vested by BOI in Kuliyapitiya was given on a freehold basis to Western Automobile Assembly for a proposed Vehicle Assembly Plant. The BOI has also granted 357 acres in the same area on a 99 year lease for 1 USD per acre per annum to Merbok, in settlement of a dispute arising from a contract signed in year 2000.
? All expenses in developing this land, includingconstructing a treatment plant, internal roadways &obtainingtransformers, etc will be on account of the investor. Therefore, this project should be considered on the same basis as the MAS project.
? This investor applied to set up the plant inMarch 2016 when they were eligible for the tax concessions under BOI.
? Initially, BOI took steps to acquire a private land in Horana but since the owners of that land were unwilling to sell this property BOI was instructed not to acquire that land as per this President?s observation on Cabinet Paper no MODSIT/3/CAB/16/8 dated 2016.06.02
? We believe the investor should not be penalized for this delay on the part of BOI to make available the land. Accordingly a Cabinet Memorandum was submitted on 2016.10.03 identifying the BOI owned land at Wagawaththa and explaining this position.Accordingly approvalwas granted by the Cabinet on granting the tax concessions prevailing at the time of the application.
? It is worth to mention that in different countries promoting investment projects, various mechanisms exist for lease of land and providing infrastructure on case by case basis, based on evaluation of salient features of the project, level of infrastructure required, extent of land, etc. In India, in certain states land is given for one Indian Rupee per Acre per year to attract investors.When proposals for investments are received we do not look at the political affiliations of the investor and projects are evaluated and approved on the basis of economic and social benefits to the country.

Mattala Airport in full throttle
	
Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA), which was once dubbed as a ghost airport by both local and foreign commentators, has suddenly turned into life becoming one of the busiest airports in the world, due to the temporary closure of Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) for the relaying of its decade-old runaway.
With the operations at BIA increasingly becoming chaotic, an increasing number of airlines has started flying in and out of MRIA carrying thousands of passengers on a daily basis.
According to MRIA officials, at least 14 airlines, including state-owned SriLankan Airlines and some charter flights, are now flying to Mattala, saving millions of dollars in foreign exchange to the country.
Mirror Business spotted a few of these flights from new airlines such as Sriwijaya Air, an Indonesian airline based in Jakarta, and Jordan Aviation, an airline based in Amman, flying in an out of MRIA through Flightradar24, a global flight tracking service that provides with real-time information.
Even when BIA was in full operation, the low-cost carrier, flydubai, has been making regular flights to Mattala since the opening of the airport. SriLankan Airlines flights to Shanghai and Beijing also used to make stopovers at MRIA.
The airport and aviation experts however question the selection of the location for Sri Lanka?s second international airport due to the presence of strong cross winds in the area, which makes a pilot?s job much harder in landing a passenger aircraft.
Also, frequent bird strikes and unavailability of parallel taxi ways and enough runaway exits have also been highlighted as major shortcomings of MRIA.
However, they do not appear to consider them as reasons to abandon the facility, which can be easily made financially viable by way of fixing some of these limitations and making the airport attractive by offering competitive handling charges, etc. ?
However, the coalition regime, which came into power promising full-stop to the Rajapaksa vanity projects, took no time to turn one of MRIA?s unused terminals into a warehouse for storing rice.
However, the government is reportedly finding bidders to sell the airport, likely to a Chinese operator, to settle the debt drawn from China to construct the airport.

PM May says she will publish 'White Paper' setting out Brexit plan
	
?
REUTERS, 25th JANUARY, 2017- Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday she would publish her plan for Britain?s exit from the European Union in a formal ?White Paper? to allow parliament to scrutinize it.
Last week, May said Britain would quit the EU?s single market when it leaves the union, charting a course for a clean break with the world?s largest trading bloc.
A court ruled on Tuesday that the government must seek parliamentary approval before triggering the legal process of exiting the bloc.
Following her speech and the court ruling, many lawmakers, including some from her own party, said they wanted to see the plans set out in a formal ?White Paper? to facilitate greater scrutiny before a parliamentary vote on triggering .
White papers are policy documents produced by the government that set out their proposals for future legislation.
The government had responded to those calls by saying it believed the publication of a white paper was not necessary.

President acts like FM;  Ravi like President: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today it seems that President had become the Finance Minister while the Finance Minister had become the President.
He told journalists at the Abhayaramaya temple that the finance minister was acting beyond his powers.
Mr. Rajapaksa expressed these views in response to a question on the sale of lotteries at Rs.30 despite the President?s opposition.
?Such a thing would not have happened in my time,? he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the President was trying to evade his responsibilities all the time and added that a President could not do so.
?The President, as the head of the Government, cannot run away from his responsibilities when something wrong has been done by the Finance Minister or the Prime Minister,? he said.

SL beats SA by five wickets to win T20 series
	
Niroshan Dickwella struck a crucial 68 as Sri Lanka beat South Africa by five wickets in Wednesday's Twenty20 international at Newlands to secure its first trophy on South African soil.
Chasing a challenging 170 to win the decisive third match after AB de Villiers had struck 63 on his return to international cricket, Dickwella shared in a 71-run stand with Dhananjaya de Silva (19) before Seekkuge Prasanna's destructive 37 saw Sri Lanka home with one ball to spare.
The visitors clinched the three-match series 2-1 as a result but were grateful to some poor fielding from the South Africans, who dropped five catches in total - including three in three balls.
De Villiers had not played an international match since June last year due to an elbow injury but was soon part of the action after the hosts won the toss and elected to bat.
After Jon-Jon Smuts (19) and Reeza Hendricks (41) put on 36 for the first wicket, De Villiers eased back into the international game with a 35-ball fifty as he put on 71 for the second wicket with Hendricks.
Although South Africa was derailed by the loss of four wickets in four overs, Mangaliso Mosehle's unbeaten 32 from 15 deliveries gave it a strong total of 169 for five.
Sri Lanka's reply followed a similar pattern, with Dickwella putting on 36 for the first wicket with Upul Tharanga (20) and then the 71 for the third wicket with De Silva (19).
Imran Tahir pulled the match back in South Africa's favour when he dismissed both Dickwella and De Silva in the same over and recorded figures of 3-18, but Sri Lanka refused to give up.
Prasanna struck three clean sixes in his 16-ball innings to leave 11 runs required from the final over before all-rounder Asela Gunaratne finished the job with two boundaries off fast bowler Dane Paterson. (Indian Express)

SL key part of ?neighbourhood first? policy: India
	
Sri Lanka continues to be a key part of India?s ?neighbourhood first? policy, Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu said today.
He expressed these views at the 68th Republic Day of India celebrations held at India House in Colombo.
The High Commissioner said he hoped that Sri Lankan businesses would take advantage of their proximity to the fastest growing major economy, India.
?India?s total development assistance commitment to Sri Lanka is now around US$ 2.6 billion, with over US$ 435 million as outright grants. The Indian flagship housing project, aiming to construct 50,000 houses, is proceeding well with over 45,300 houses constructed till date,? he said.
The envoy cautioned against the threat posed by the dark forces of terrorism and stressed the necessity of defeating these forces decisively.
While reading out excerpts from the Address to the Nation by Indian President Pranab Mukherjee, the High Commissioner credited strong democratic institutions built over the last six and a half decades for making India an oasis of stability.
He highlighted India?s achievement in social, political and economic fields in the last six and half decades.
?Today, India is the fastest growing economy amongst the major economies of the world. India is the second largest reservoir of scientific and technical manpower, the third largest army, the sixth member of the nuclear club, the sixth member in the race for space, and the tenth largest industrial power. From a net food grains importing country, India is now a leading exporter of food commodities,? he said.

"Tamil Eelam" removed from list of countries
	
The Sri Lankan government had got Denmark and Australia to remove ?Tamil Eelam? from the list of states mentioned in some of their websites, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera informed Parliament yesterday.
?The Danish Government had apologised for referring to ?Tamil Eelam? in its websites as a legitimate state, and had removed it,? he said, in response to an oral question raised by MP Udaya Gammanpila last afternoon.
?The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) had listed ?Tamil Elam?, in its website, among the countries which could be named as the country of birth in the Australian census of 2016. This was removed the day after the Sri Lankan High Commission in that country made representations against it,? he added.
The minister said there was no government in existence called ?Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam' but only a group of self styled people who call themselves the transnational government.
?This group of people are clinging to a dream just like the joint opposition which set up a shadow cabinet,? he said.
?Oh here comes the shadow Prime Minister!? he exclaimed, as he saw former president Mahinda Rajapaksa entering the chamber. ?No, no I am not," Mr Rajapaksa was heard to say in response.
Mr Gammanpilla then asked how Rudarakumaran could refer to himself the prime minister of the transnational government.
? Why can?t Rudrakumaran cling to a dream if the joint opposition can do so?? Mr. Samaraweera asked. (Yohan Perera)

Three-wheeler registrations slump as new leasing levels come into effect
	
The registration of three-wheelers has nosedived to a quarter of the previous levels since the new loan-to-value (LTV) ratios for automobile financing came into effect this month, according to an industry expert.
?The rule has been in effect for only 10 days but the volumes are coming down to one-fourth. I can?t tell you exactly because the leases were given based on the old rules for the first half of the month, so we will have to wait till the next month to see the accurate figures,? Finance Houses Association of Sri Lanka Chairman Ravi Yatawara said.
The government last week introduced a 25 percent LTV ratio for three-wheelers, a 50 percent LTV ratio for motorcars and vans and a 90 percent LTV ratio for commercial vehicles.
The government excluded the vehicles imported for tourism purposes from being subjected to the new rules.
For the first 11 months of 2016, an average of 4,585 three-wheelers was registered each month, after a 70 percent LTV ratio was introduced in December 2015.
"Around 4,000 to 5,000 three-wheelers were registered every month and I think this will come down to 1,000," Yatawara said.
In 2015, the average three-wheeler registration for a month was 10,743.
The government brought in the heavy LTV ratio and other regulatory measures on three-wheelers last week after evaluating the research submitted by the local academia.
Currently, Sri Lanka has over one million three-wheelers, which is thrice the demand requirement for the country, according to research. However, the prices have not fallen in line with the supply glut, with some three-wheeler drivers continuing to charge ad hoc prices.
A wide section of society in Colombo blame three-wheelers and buses for creating unsafe and congested roads and bus and three-wheeler trade associations had strongly opposed the government's recent attempts to increase traffic fines.
Despite the existence of the LTV ratio, some finance companies have resorted to creative methods to provide greater financing for customers, which the Central Bank officials said that the regulator is not in a capacity to monitor. (Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

Trump poised to move on Mexican border wall
	
Donald Trump will take a first step toward enacting his pledge to ?build a wall? on the Mexican border Wednesday by issuing an executive decree. ??
The White House said that Trump will visit the Department of Homeland Security in the afternoon, when he is expected to roll out a series of immigration-related measures. ??
??Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall!? Trump tweeted late Tuesday. ??
Stemming immigration to the United States was a central plank of Trump?s election campaign. ??
His signature policy was to build a wall across the 2,000 mile (3,200 kilometer) border between the United States and Mexico. ??
Some of the border is already fenced, but Trump has argued that a wall is needed to stop illegal immigrants entering from Latin America. ??
Experts have voiced serious doubts about whether a wall would actually stem illegal immigration, or if its worth investing billions in such a project when there are other cost effective methods of achieving similar results. ??
But the issue has become a clarion call for the US right and far right, the core of Trump?s support. ??
After four days in office some are wondering why the populist president?s policies have been largely indistinguishable from those of orthodox Republicans. ? ?His promised executive order may be a way to slake that thirst. ??
Still, any action from the White House would be piecemeal, diverting only existing funds toward the project. ?The Republican-controlled Congress would need to supply new money if the project is to be anywhere near completed, and Trump?s party has spent years preaching fiscal prudence. ? ? ?

When they go awry
	
?
?
People are generally unaware of the presence of a host of organs in their bodies. But when they are brought into focus when they fall sick, physicians are consulted and remedies are sought. ?However when there is a feeling that something is wrong with the ears, nose and throat, they are usually chalked down as a symptom of an ordinary cold. Surprisingly some of these symptoms may not be caused by a cold at all. Mirror Medicine spoke to Consultant ENT surgeon at the National Hospital, Colombo, Dr. Chandra Jayasuriya to speak about some of the most common illnesses in the ear, nose and throat.
?
?Hear this!
According to Dr. Jayasuriya, most patients seek medical advice for ?problems of the ear. She says the lack of knowledge about problems of the ear compel them to seek a doctor?s advice. ?Ear problems are very common among our patients. Out of these injuries resulting from attempts to self-clean the ear are predominant. We see at least five to six patients a day where either the head of a cotton bud has dislodged and got stuck in the ear, or the patient has damaged the inner walls of the ear or even the ear drum, when trying to clean the ear using things like hairpins,? Dr. Jayasuriya said. ?The ear is self-cleaning and there is no need to clean it. The human body produces earwax to keep the ears lubricated, clean and protected. The jaw motions from talking and chewing, along with skin growth within the canal, typically help to move old earwax from inside to the outside the ear. ?A blocked ear with earwax is treated by removing the wax using a special instrument by an ENT doctor. ??
The common cold also results in a number of symptoms that causes discomfort in the ears, nose and throat. However what starts out as a common cold can result in one or more of these organs being subjected to some form of infection. According to Dr. Jayasuriya, continuous bleeding from the ear cavity with no sign of pain can be the telling signs of a chronic ear infection. Such acute infections can harm a person?s ability to hear, damage the ear drum and even cause deafness. Some of the contributory factors to such hearing damage could however be caused by exposure to loud sounds or noise pollution and a foreign body entering the ear canal. ??
While adults are able to identify symptoms infection or discomfort, in an ear, it proves to be difficult to identify these symptoms in children. Asked how parents can know of a persistent ear problem in a child, Dr. Jayasuriya said children will only be able to identify discomfort within the ear. ?Children will complain of severe pain or discomfort in the case of an ear infection, mostly by crying and pulling at the ear. In the case of adults however, deafness, dizziness and vertigo can be a symptom. Some others will complain of hearing noises within the ear known as Tinnitus.? In such cases Dr. Jayasuriya recommends immediate medical attention. The treatment for temporary hearing loss depends on its cause and is often treated successfully usually through antibiotics. In cases of permanent hearing loss, hearing devices may be used to restore hearing and to help with communications. ??
?
The sniffles
A blocked or stuffy nose is one of the most common difficulties many endure. This nasal congestion is caused when the tissues lining the nose swell due to inflamed blood vessels. Even though most prefer not to treat a stuffy nose, nasal congestion can eventually lead to hearing and speech problems. If the condition is not treated it may also lead to a condition known as sleep apnea which causes one or several pauses while breathing. ??
According to Dr. Jayasuriya there are several causes for infections of the nasal cavity; viral infections, allergies and rhinitis. Viral infections are the cause of the common cold, flu and even sinus infections. These viruses are transmitted by air which causes the nasal tissues to swell up resulting in the discharge of nasal mucous. Sinus infection also causes nasal congestion which leads to the thick discharge of mucous. Sinusitis is the inflammation of sinuses in and around the nasal region causing blocked noses. ??
Another cause for severe discomfort in the nasal cavity are allergies. Allergy occurs due to the inflammatory response to harmless environmental substances known as allergens such as pollen, dust mites, house dust, and animal dander and tobacco smoke.?
These allergens releases a substance called histamine which can cause congestion and the excess production of watery mucous. ?One of the most common complaints made by patients are allergies caused by hair dye. Sri Lankan adults are accustomed to the practice of colouring their hair frequently to mask grey hair. For this purpose they use black hair dye products. What they do not realise is that our natural hair colour is not black but brown. Therefore most people develop allergies to the black tinting agent. The symptoms of this allergy will present itself as an itchy scalp, headache and redness in and around the contact area,? Dr. Jayasuriya explained. She cautioned that those who wish to colour their hair must first perform a patch test with the chosen product. ??
Some allergies may develop symptoms such as sneezing, nasal congestion, itchy nose and eyes, running nose, and sore throat. Dr. Jayasuriya opines that prevention or avoidance is the best treatment for allergies. ?If the cause of the allergy is identified it should be avoided. For example if you are allergic to some food or animal fur it should be removed or kept away and medications such as the use of an inhaler should be adopted,? she said. ?
?
Lump in the throat
According to Dr. Jayasuriya a sore throat is the most common throat disorder among patients, often caused due to common cold and flu. Other conditions that may cause sore throat include, allergies, infection with streptococcal bacteria, smoking, tonsillitis and viral infections. However those with a constant sore throat may realise how simple daily activities such as speaking and eating become difficult with a throat that continues to be itchy and scruffy. Dr Jayasuriya said that patients however prefer to self treat problems of the throat. ? The throat being the common passage for food and air is more susceptible to infections and other conditions. Patients with sore throats may experience pain and difficulty in breathing and swallowing. Fever may also be a symptom. Salt water gargles, drinking lots of liquids and gargling may provide temporary relief from pain. For recurrent sore throat, antibiotics are usually prescribed by doctors.? ??
Hoarseness is a symptom and not a disease itself. It is a general term that describes abnormal voice changes. When hoarse, the voice may sound breathy, raspy, strained; or there may be changes in volume. Dr. Jayasuriya recommends drinking hot water, speaking only when necessary and also sucking on lozenges and chewing either gum or the root of the herb Velmi to relieve a sore throat. ?Patients must also exercise their respiratory track by taking deep breaths and also avoid consuming dairy products such as milk, yoghurt or cheese.? ??
There are many causes of hoarseness; fortunately, most are not serious and tend to go away in a short period of time. If hoarseness persists longer than two weeks, a visit to your physician is recommended. While not always the case, persistent hoarseness can be a warning sign of a more serious illness.?
