Renewable Energy Park in former LTTE stronghold
The one time stronghold of the LTTE in the North is to be turned into a 6,000 hectare Renewable Energy Park generating 240MW of wind and 800MW of solar power.
Cabinet this week granted approval to the proposal made by Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya to build a renewable energy park in Pooneryn to be completed by 2030.
The Sustainable Energy Authority in a feasibility study has identified this village in the Kilinochchi District to be the most viable; economically, environmentally and socially to set up a hybrid energy park with both wind and solar power. The Authority will also in the near future declare Pooneryn as a Renewable Energy Development area as per the provisions of section 12 of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority Act.
According to the Cabinet proposal on the project, it is to be set up in three phases; 120MW solar power and 150MW wind power by 2022, further 100MW of wind and 100MW solar by 2025 and the balance by 2030.
The project also proposes to provide around 2000 indirect and direct employment within two years in one of the poorest districts in the country.
The Energy Park proposal however is yet to find an investor and the minister proposes that this would be done through a competitive international bidding process. In addition, the project will also need necessary infrastructure developments in areas such as transmission lines, grid substation control rooms and access roads.
Once built, the park is to be managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).
Sri Lanka in 2015, ratified the UN COP 21 Agreement to reduce 20 percent of Green House Gas Emissions by 2030 where 4 percent should be reduced without any condition and 16 percent would be conditional reductions with the assistance of foreign sources. Thus this project declares that it would reduce 1,050,000 MT of Carbon dioxide emissions by the end of it.
Renewable energy has been a strong focus of the government with similar wind and solar plants being built in Mannar, Siyambalanduwa, Chunnakam, Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa.

The right step
A Special Police Unit is to be set up to deal with incidents that has a religious or communal tinge, it was reported yesterday. This follows the recent tension wrought by attacks on Muslim shops and a mosque in Kurunegala. The President and Prime Minister have taken serious note of these incidents and has ordered the police for speedy action to arrest the situation. It was noted that attempts were being made to spark racial and religious conflagration by defeated political elements to stage a comeback. This was based on the identity of the nationalist organisations and groups which have recently stepped up their incendiary rhetoric targeting minority religions. Yesterday in this space we called on the government to nip this phenomenon in the bud lest it escalates into another Aluthgama. It is matter for gratification that some solid action has been taken by the authorities in this connection. The country has just come out of a long drawn out ethnic war. It certainly can do without a war brought on by religion.
According to the report the unit will be set up under the Law and Order and Southern Development Ministry on the instructions of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Special handpicked officers will be selected to man this unit which will be tasked with promptly deploying police personnel in the stations where trouble erupts to quell such incidents and apprehend those responsible. In addition intelligence reports on plans by organised communal and religious groups to attack religious events by using communalism as a tool is to be handed over to the President and the Prime Minister next week. A list of such groups established to fan communal and religious friction too is to be handed over to the President and PM.
While the move to a set up a Special Police Unit to combat ethnic and religious violence is to be commended it should be ensured that it (unit) moves with caution. We say this because there will be Opposition politicians who will make the allegation that the government was using the police to target the majority Sinhalese.The special unit should therefore not plunge into any precipitate action - particularly in the case of Bikkhus, who can be counted on to be in the forefront of any planned incident. There will also be an element of lukewarmness among some of the policemen deployed to deal with incidents with a religious or communal flavour.
There no doubt will be misgivings among some if this whole exercise will be effective. One recalls the incidents where Muslim shops and businesses came under attack by stone throwing mobs led by some Bikkhus. On that occasion the police were mere bystanders, reluctant to take action against the mob. The presence of the Buddhist clergy may well have been a disincentive for the police to act although it was also known that the attacks had the blessings of the powers that be. This was the same scenario that was witnessed even during the Black July mayhem. Will there be a replay of the same given that almost all men in the police service belong to the majority community, though it must be said they are professionals first and foremost.
Hence, the officers for this special unit should be carefully selected to ensure an even handed implementation of the law. In a way one wonders if a special unit of this nature is needed at all if the police carry out its duties independently. It was Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka's complaint that foot dragging by the police had resulted in the wrong picture going to the public, referring to two recent incidents where damage caused to two Muslim businesses had nothing to do with religion but the result of accidents and theft which however went down as communal attacks due to the delay by the police to submit their reports.
The police as a whole are also guilty of procrastination in moving in certain cases, particularly where politicians are involved and wait for instructions from the top'. This is unbecoming conduct of police officers and a slur on the Khaki uniform. True, Sri Lanka's political culture is unique and politicians are treated as sacred cows. But the law has to be applied equally, however hackneyed this may sound, if the police are to regain the public confidence which had suffered over the years. The police need not to be told their job and should get about their duties without anybody's prompting. It also need not disclose its inner workings. We say this because today we read of special teams being deployed to probe a particular crime or apprehend a particular suspect, which the public are not interested in. How the police get about its business or how many teams deployed to arrest suspects is of no concern to the public. The police need not have to be given a push by the President, Prime Minister or the IGP to go after criminals as is the case today. It should strive to erase this negative impression from the minds of the public.

Rooney left out of England squad in latest blow
LONDON, Thursday: Wayne Rooneys international career looks over after Englands all-time top-scorer was Thursday left out of the squad for next months World Cup qualifier against Scotland and a friendly in France.
The 31-year-old striker has lost his place at Manchester United and was similarly omitted from Gareth Southgates England squad announced in March, although he was carrying a knee injury at the time.
Fit-again Rooney, who made a brief appearance in Manchester Uniteds Europa League final win over Ajax in Stockholm on Wednesday, had hoped to end his international career by captaining England at next years World Cup in Russia.
But this now looks an increasingly forlorn hope for Rooney, Englands record goalscorer with 53 goals and their most capped outfielder with 119 appearances for his country.
His United career could also be over having fallen down the pecking order under manager Jose Mourinho.
We have a lot of players playing exceptionally well in the area of the pitch that Wayne plays, Southgate told thefa.com.
I said last time (in March) that he was a bit short of matches -- hes had some matches now but weve got players that have done really, really well for us in Adam Lallana and Dele Alli.
I cant dress it up any other way -- other players are in really good form and deserve to keep their place.
Southgate did not rule out entirely a recall for Rooney, who is three years younger than veteran striker Jermain Defoe, who has been retained despite Sunderlands desperate season seeing them relegated.
You never write off a player of Waynes quality and Im sure that, next season, hell be back to playing, said Southgate.
Hes finished the season a bit better and Im sure hell take that into next year.
England face oldest rivals Scotland in a World Cup qualifier at Glasgows Hampden Park on June 10 before travelling to Paris for a friendly three days later.
England squad: Goalkeepers: Jack Butland (Stoke City), Fraser Forster (Southampton), Joe Hart (Torino/ITA, on loan from Manchester City), Tom Heaton (Burnley)
Defenders: Ryan Bertrand (Southampton), Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Nathaniel Clyne (Liverpool), Aaron Cresswell (West Ham United), Ben Gibson (Middlesbrough), Phil Jones (Manchester United), Chris Smalling (Manchester United), John Stones (Manchester City), Kieran Trippier (Tottenham Hotspur), Kyle Walker (Tottenham Hotspur)
Midfielders: Eric Dier (Tottenham Hotspur), Adam Lallana (Liverpool), Jake Livermore (West Bromwich Albion), Dele Alli (Tottenham Hotspur), Jesse Lingard (Manchester United), Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal), Raheem Sterling (Manchester City)
Forwards: Jermain Defoe (Sunderland), Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur), Marcus Rashford (Manchester United), Jamie Vardy (Leicester City)

Speaking of the reshuffle
Politics is the art of the impossible, some say. Perhaps it is quite true, for how else one could explain the removal of the Best Finance Minister in the World Perhaps His Excellency may want to make affable Ravi K the best Fo reign Minister too. Good luck!
A little bit of reflection would, however, show that removal of the best is something inherent in our political culture itself. It is only necessary to remind oneself about the removal of the Best Army Commander in the World. What more, he was not only removed but also stripped of rank, dragged along, humiliated and incarcerated.
The above development is only one aspect of the much talked about, much publicized and less thought about Cabinet re-shuffle that took place Monday, most probably at an auspicious morning hour. Hence, the inevitable compulsion to make our comment also known. Yet a Cabinet reshuffle is a serious business beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals like your columnist.
In order not to venture into dangerous ground or trespass into the domain of politicians whose numerous and solemn comments on the event are greedily consumed by the media and the public we would only attempt to make a few comments in lighter vein for the benefit of the public (Hudee jana pahan sanvegaya sandaha). It is hoped they would be taken up in good spirit and cheer and at the worst considered as a monologue of an eccentric for the latter also belongs to the category of critics throughout millennia.
Jumbo Cabinet
The first impression upon the receipt of information on the change was that it resembled somewhat a home cure for headache - changing pillows. It is wrong. What it looks like is not a change of pillows but the dressing of them with the same soiled covers inside out leaving the same dirty bed linen and the creaking ramshackle bed intact.
What more the jumbo Cabinet which is bursting at the seams has become even bigger though by a few percentage points. This causes anxiety for even a straw added to the weight could become critical at times. The public is nonplussed whether this is one of the exigencies of service required for Yahapalanaya or good governance. In contrast, the French seem to be eccentric to reduce their Cabinet from 18 to 15. The more the merrier is our motto! The mass consciousness in this country accepts that our Cabinet is not an exclusive club of saints or clean uncorrupt personalities. And there is no smoke without fire! Even the highest in the land has accepted the reality of corrupt fellow-travellers, those who hold skeletons in their own cupboards, in the Cabinet of Ministers. Had at least one of them been removed from office the reshuffle could have been seen in a much more positive light. Clean up and not shake up is the need of the hour.
At the depth of the heart of the man in the street there was a faint hope, however irrational, that the reshuffle would amount to a course correction for the ship of state drifting afloat in the wide ocean without a compass. It still remains in the realm of hope and not reality.
Finance and media
By far the largest beneficiary from the reshuffle is energetic Minister Mangala Samaraweera who has been entrusted with two vital portfolios  finance and media. It is to his credit that he accepted the responsibilities with a touch of humility even mentioning that it is with some trepidation that he is stepping into the shoes of former great personalities such as Dr. N M Perera, J R Jayewardene, Ronnie de Mel and Felix Dias Bandaranaike etc. Incidentally, in referring to those great men he has positioned his immediate predecessor- the best Finance Minister - in the proper perspective and stature.
Media has been his home turf even earlier though he has turned from blue to green in the interim period. Media also has become freer. However, the real test of his capabilities would be in handling finance. Of course, he has an unenviable job in view of the fact that there is neither a clear-cut national economic policy nor any mapped out economic strategy and planning.
Though cynics would say that as a finance minister in a Third World Country with limited resources he has only to present a budget tailor-made by the International Monetary Fund, his real challenge would be to harmonize the diverse demands of varying social forces that support the Government and those of the financiers  both local and global, to achieve a growth and expansion of the economy that would ensure the country's escape from the debt-trap it is engulfed in. Development means no longer cosmetic improvement of infrastructure as the case has been so far but development of the productive spheres of the economy which could generate new wealth and create more jobs for the people.
Whatever the rhetoric of politicians, whatever are the bouquets and brickbats in the media, whatever the reactions of all sections of the people the ultimate success or failure of the reshuffle would be seen only in the future.
In the meantime, since impermanence is in the nature of things we pray that a more realistic purposeful and prudent course correction would overtake the changes envisaged at present. With that we conclude our observations on a note of optimism for otherwise despair would overwhelm us and paralyze the body politic.

The combination of spices, coconut milk and coconut oil, vegetables, fish and meats, and the use of clay chattis or cooking pots, all contribute to the end product of complex yet exquisite dishes, she said.

Tissa says American Naval camp to be set up in Trinco
Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Leader Prof. Tissa Witharana yesterday said that an American Naval camp is to be set up in Trincomalee, with the Trincomalee harbor as the focal point.
According to him, a bilateral agreement in this regard has already been signed between Sri Lanka and America. He said so at a press conference at the party headquarters in Colombo yesterday. Addressing media Prof. Witharana said that the agreement has been signed secretly to establish an American naval camp. Quoting a article that appeared in newspapers, he said that America has agreed to set up the Naval camp in Trincomalee in the future. However, the media pointed out to him that the particular media reports have been issued in relation to a meeting of security forces personnel of both countries aiming to conduct a joint naval exercise in future but not relating to establishing an American naval camp.
He further said that there is another bilateral agreement between India and America. Under this agreement America will issue high-grade uranium to India to be used for Indias nuclear activities.
Meanwhile Sri Lanka is going to purchase American fighter jets at a cost of US $ 400 million and military equipment amounting US $ 300 million., Witarana revealed
What is the use of purchasing fighter jets at this juncture since the countrys security is not under threat.
Why spend such a huge amount of public funds He asked.
He said that religious harmony in the country was at a risk considering the incidents that had been taking place in the recent past including attacks on religious places . But the government has failed to take action against those responsible behind these incidents.

We got the talent and the team to express ourselves  Mathews
Sri Lanka will embrace the underdog tag at the ICC Champions Trophy in England, according to skipper Angelo Mathews.
A joint-winner in 2002, Sri Lanka has only reached the semi-final stage once since, getting to the last four in the 2013 edition, also in England.
In a pool also featuring India, Pakistan and South Africa, Mathews admits his team is being seen as an outsider to lift the trophy, but is confident Sri Lanka has the firepower to make a run at the title.
Mathews said: All the teams are quite even, I think in the past few months we have had a few lapses here and there. Nobody will give us a chance, to be really honest, but we are happy to enter the tournament as underdogs.
We are confident, we have prepared extremely well. In Sri Lanka and England for the past few days, its been really good. Hopefully we can play tomorrows practice game (against Australia), and get a good practice out of it.
All the teams are quite even but its on the given day, the guys who make less mistakes will win. It can be England, it can be us, it can be anyone.
Everyone has got a chance, no one can write anyone off and Im sure it will be a very exciting tournament.
Still only 29, Mathews is one of the veteran leaders in the Sri Lanka team, and was part of the side that beat England 3-2 in a one-day international series back in 2014.
While the batting line-up has a very different look to it in this tournament, Mathews is confident that Sri Lanka can use that experience to its advantage.
He added: We are a team where we stick to our basics. Weve played pretty well in England, especially in 2014, so we will try to take a leaf out of it.
We are a pretty young, inexperienced team, but a few of us have played in England. Anyone can change a game at any given stage. We have got the talent, the skill in the team, its just that we have to go out there and express ourselves, he said.
The x-factor for Sri Lanka could be Lasith Malinga, who is included in the squad and is in line for a first one-day appearance since 2015.
Now almost exclusively playing in Twenty20 cricket, Malinga enters the tournament fully fit according to his skipper, who is optimistic the 33-year-old fast bowler can shine in the longer format.
Mathews said: (Malinga) is fully fit. We look forward to utilising him in the matches. He is very keen, he got here a few days back. Hes very keen to get on the park. He hasnt played 50-over games in the recent past but he has played a lot of games in the IPL which is very intense.
Hes been doing a lot of training as well. He is confident, we are confident as well. We all know he is a match winner, he has proven himself over the past many years. He can win us a game single-handedly, so we are looking forward to it.
Sri Lanka will kick off its campaign against South Africa before the two matches against its sub-continental rivals.
And despite a surprise loss to Scotland in a warm-up game, quickly avenged two days later, Mathews believes his side will be ready for English conditions.
He added: It was just a practice game for us, we rested a few players. In an ideal scenario, we would have bowled first but I wanted our batters to bat in those conditions when the wicket is fresh.
The result didnt matter to us, even in the second game when we thrashed them, we just wanted to go out there and acclimatise, get used to the conditions and the wickets and the pace and spend some time in the middle. - ICC

When a Man Loves a Woman
In the summer of 1988, a graduate of Harvard Law School told her mother she was going to concentrate on her law career and not worry about dating. She was 25 and had just finished her first year as an associate at Sidley & Austin, a corporate law firm in her home town of Chicago.
Not long after, the firm assigned her to mentor a 27-year-old prodigy also from Harvard Law School hired by Sidley as a summer associate. She was assigned to 'teach him the ropes.' His name struck her as odd, as did the fact that he had grown up in Hawaii. She assumed he would be "strange and overly intellectual" and that she would almost certainly dislike him.
She still remembers her early impressions when he showed up in her office. "He had no money; he was really broke. He wasn't ever going to try to impress me with things. His wardrobe was kind of cruddy . . . His first car had so much rust that there was a rusted hole in the passenger door. You could see the ground when you were driving. He loved that car. It would shake ferociously when it would start up. I thought, 'This brother is not interested in ever making a dime."
All the same, she liked him well enough to take him home to meet her family. Her older brother, who knew about her impossibly high standards when it came to men thought this too would end the same way the others had ended. He knew her habits. "She would meet guys and go out on a couple of dates, and that would be it.
So when he came over for dinner, the whole family felt sorry for him, assuming he wouldn't be around for long. "He was very, very low-key," her brother said. "I loved the way he talked about his family because it was the way we talked about our family. I was thinking: 'Nice guy. Too bad he won't last.'
But he did last. Barack Obama will never forget the first time he saw Michelle Robinson. I remember being struck by how tall and beautiful she was, he recalls. But whenever he asked her out she refused. I'm your adviser, she said. It's not appropriate. When Barack offered to quit his job if it would make her go out with him, she finally agreed. For their first date, they saw Spike Lees Do the Right Thing and ate ice cream afterwards. When she came home that night Michelle realized her life had changed forever. We clicked right away...by the end of the date it was over...I was sold, she recalled later.
Before Michelle, Barack had brought only one woman to Hawaii to meet his family, according to his younger half-sister, Maya Soetoro. He in turn was Michelles first serious boyfriend, according to Craig Robinson, Michelles brother: none of the others had met her standards.
During their three-year courtship, the couple shared thrilling moments, like when Barack became the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. But there were crushing ones too. In early 1991, Fraser Robinson, Michelles father, who was employed by the city to tend boilers at a water treatment plant, came down with what seemed to be the flu. Just a few days later, he was brain-dead, and his family had to decide whether to end life support. Barack was in the middle of classes, with no money to speak of, but he flew to Chicago to be with Michelle, anyway.
After he went back to Harvard, the couple had a long-distance romance. This was when Michelle began to pressure Barack saying they should get married. But Barack put her off, arguing that marriage was a meaningless institution and that the only thing that mattered was how they felt about each other. Michelle, whose parents had been married for over 30 years, wasn't convinced.
Then, one night in 1991, he took her to Gordon, an expensive Chicago restaurant, and she started to press him again. He went into his usual tirade against marriage, a speech that went on until they ordered dessert. When it came, the plate had a box on it, and in the box was an engagement ring. "That kind of shuts you up, doesn't it" he had asked her with a twinkle in his eyes. Michelle confesses she doesn't remember what the dessert was, or whether she ate it. She says, "I was so shocked and a little embarrassed because he did sort of shut me up."
On October 3, 1992, Michelle and Barack said "I do" at Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. The bride's brother walked her down the aisle, while the groom's brother served as best man. Michelle looked the perfect 90s bride in an off-the-shoulder long sleeved gown, puffy veil, and statement drop pearl earrings. A reception was held at the South Shore Cultural Center where Michelle chose Steve Wonder's "You and I" for their first dance as husband and wife.
Of their vows, Michelle says, Barack didnt pledge riches, only a life that would be interesting. Looking back into the past, today she says, On that promise he delivered.

Corporates save US$ half trillion adopting Six Sigma
The world which laughed and ignored the Lean Six Sigma segment has reversed its stance and today leading corporates globally are implementing this and reaping benefits from it, said Don Drury, Executive Director, SSMI Asia.
Speaking at the International Conference on Organizational Excellence and Lean Six Sigma at Kings Court, Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel, Colombo, yesterday, he said that adopting of Six Sigma has resulted in companies all over the world being more efficient.
In addition the practice has also helped to save over a half a trillion dollars annually for companies, he said.
Regional Head Continuous improvement (CI) of NOKIA, Ashutosh Pandey, in a case study discussed at the event said that one of the biggest mistakes Nokia did to lose their global mobile number one position was not adapting to change.
He said that they also did not read the future trends of the industry in advance and decision makers could learn a lot from the Nokia case study.
I think it is also fair to mention at this stage that when the company wanted to launch a smartphone, both our consultants and even McKinsey Global Institute research said that the global market was ready for it.
Though we had the device up and ready we delayed and then other producers like Apple launched it and it took the world by storm. By the time we came forward, it was rather late to catch up.
However Nokia took note of the situation and after falling back has now caught up and today we have over 26 different kind of businesses which are powered and guided by the Six Sigma segment as well. Today we have even acquired Alcatel and have several global patents under our belt.
He also said that many people may now know that Nokia has being in existence for over 150 years and started up as a paper pulp manufacturing company.
Though Nokias tag line was connecting people, we saw that due to the hard work of our employees which resulted in their travelling extensively, families were being disconnected.
Joining the discussion, Dr. Ashok Sarkar, from the Indian Statistical Institute, said that one of the major issues that went wrong for Nokia was that they did not look at what is happening outside.
The event was Sri Lanka's first-ever International Conference on Organizational Excellence and Lean Six Sigma, organized to celebrate 30 years of Six Sigma and to pay tribute its Co-founder, the late Prof. Mikel J Harry.
This unique event was organized by the Asian branch (Dr Mikel J Harry Six Sigma Management Institute Asia - Six Sigma Asia Private Limited) of Dr Mikel J Harry Six Sigma Management Institute Inc., USA, a pioneer institution in organizational excellence, related consultancy, training and deployment in the world.
Conference Chair and the Executive Director of SSMI Asia, Dumidu Ranaweera said, The event also promoted the use of Organizational Excellence (OE) and Lean Six Sigma practices in the island.
The event is supported by many leading institutes in Sri Lanka including Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM), Institute of Personnel Management (IPM), ACCA Sri Lanka, CIMA Sri Lanka, SLASSCOM, TNL Radio, Lake House, Imagine Entertainment, Sandbox, Readme, Fastforward, Cinnamon Lakeside, Walkers Tours, Cason Rent a Car, Sri Lankan Airlines, Leaf d (Pvt) Ltd. and Dulgee Creations.

SL fruits could fetch better prices in intl markets
Sri Lanka has a better chance to gain good market prices for fruit exports in the international market compared to other South Asian countries due to local farmers using minimal quantities of agro chemicals for fruit production unlike in vegetables, Agriculture Economist at the Ministry of Agriculture said.
In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture has taken steps to boost fruit exports and to stabilize market supply thereby promoting the use of rain shelters and protected houses.To address the lack of quality seeds available for the cultivation of fruit and vegetables, the ministry has presently initiated an informal seed production program at the farmer level. The off-season fruit production can also be induced from growth hormones while improving irrigation management.
The ministry has already initiated several projects at the research level to this end, the official said adding it is important to improve necessary infrastructure to stabilize the market supply. We hope that this mechanism will contribute to resolve some of the issues faced by farmers.
Moreover, the ministry has introduced a plant and soil based fertilizer program, under which, the ministry has made recommendations to maximize the use of fertilizer in agriculture, based on selected crop or place.Alternatively, the ministry is planning to promote organic agricultural products which have better market prices compared to the traditional agricultural products.
Despite the lack of infrastructure facilities in the area of cold storage, steps have also been taken at the ministry level to improve cold storage facilities at regional and central locations.
Sri Lanka is currently facing an acute labour shortage in the agriculture sector and shifting and cost of labour has become a major issue which hampers the growth of the industry to a greater level.
Highlighting high cost of production in the vegetable cultivation also as a major challenge, the official mentioned that in terms of vegetables, more than 60 % of the production cost accounts for labour cost.
Apart from that, due to the nature of perishability, Sri Lankas post-harvest food losses especially in fruit and vegetable sectors occur within the farm-to-market period during harvesting, handling, storage and etc. According to official statistics, post- harvest losses in fruit and vegetable sector accounts for more than 40%, big onions 35% and rice more than 50% due to malfunctioning of value chain in terms of handling and transport.
Nonetheless, Sri Lanka has a competitive advantage when it comes to exporting banana. In addition of promoting banana, the ministry has already taken steps to promote cultivation of some fruit crops including banana, mango, pineapple, guava, pomegranates and strawberry for export markets.

Australia and Sri Lanka to enhance cooperation in maritime security

President Maithripala Sirisena assured that his government is totally committed to support the campaign against human smuggling and sea piracy.
He said that Sri Lanka would extend fullest cooperation to the efforts taken to enhance maritime security.
The President made this statement when the Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne called on him at the Shangri-La Hotel in Sydney , yesterday.
Payne thanked the President for excellent cooperation extended to Australia for curbing human smuggling and added that the cooperation could be further extended.
President Sirisena said that drug smuggling has also become a major threat to many countries and emphasized the need for broad international cooperation to eliminate that menace.
Defence Minister, explaining the experience gained by the Australian Navy over the years to prevent drug smuggling, said that drugs have become a major threat to many societies because of its harmful effects on the young generation.
On the other hand, the drug smugglers use the profits to fund terrorist organizations and it is a major problem to law and order in many countries, she pointed out.
Hence Australia is willing to closely cooperate with Sri Lanka in this field and provide every possible assistance to Sri Lanka Navy and Coast Guard, Payne assured the President.
Australia currently provides training to military cadets from Sri Lanka, and the Defence Minister acceded to the Presidents request to expand training facilities to include middle-level and senior military officers.
Minister John Amaratunga, Deputy Ministers Harsha de Silva, Ajith P. Perera, and the High Commissioner Somasundaram Skandakumar also participated.

Australia, Sri Lanka sign new partnership to fight CKDu
Australias nuclear agency, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), yesterday signed an MOU with the Presidential Taskforce for Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease to assist in the fight against chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology (CKDu).
According to the Journal of Environmental Health and Preventative Medicine (2014), CKDu affects around 100,000 people, and is linked to 5,000 deaths every year.
It is also a serious public health problem in other countries, particularly in Central America. Despite more than 20 years of study in Sri Lanka and globally, it is not well understood.
While CKDu appears to disproportionally affect poor, rural, male farmers in hot climates, the reasons why are not yet clear.
The World Health Organisation has identified potential contributing factors, including heavy metals in the groundwater, agrochemicals, heat stress, malnutrition and low birth weight and leptospirosis.
More research on the issue is needed, said Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva, when he visited the Australian Synchrotron in March 2017.
Sri Lankas High Commissioner to Australia, Somasundaram Skandakumar and the CEO of ANSTO, Dr Adi Paterson signed an MOU in the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
The MOU will see Australia provide new insights into the disease.
Australia and Sri Lanka have developed a cooperative relationship over the past 70 years. The new agreement will impact on peoples lives, further strengthen Australias ties with Sri Lanka, and broaden Australias relationships in the region, said Australian Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, Senator Arthur Sinodinos AO.

Bangladesh down NZ to boost 2019 World Cup push
Move to sixth place in ODI standings above Sri Lanka:
DUBLIN, Wednesday: Bangladesh took a huge step towards qualifying for the 2019 World Cup with a five-wicket victory over New Zealand in the tri-series finale on Wednesday.
The win at Clontarf promoted Bangladesh to sixth place, above Sri Lanka in the standings, with just four months to go before the cut-off date of September 30 when the top eight are guaranteed automatic qualification for the finals in England.
An unbroken stand of 72 between Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah saw the Tigers to their victory target of 271 with 10 balls to spare.
Mushfiqur finished 45 not out at exactly a run a ball but the partnership was dominated by a superb innings from Mahmudullah who scored his 3,000th run in his 36-ball 46, with six fours and a six.
He took 14 off the 47th over, bowled by Hamish Bennett to make the last three overs a formality and fittingly Mahmudullah hit the winning boundary.
Bangladesh had the momentum going into the second innings after they had restricted the Black Caps to 270 for eight, with just 62 coming from the last 12 overs as five wickets fell.
Tamim Iqbal and Sabbir Rahman then carried it on with a second wicket stand of 136 with both batsmen dismissed for 65.
Tamim was caught at deep mid-wicket off Mitchell Santner and Sabbir run out by the length of the pitch when he found himself at the same end as Mosaddek Hossain.
But despite Shakib Al Hasan holing out to long leg with 72 still needed from 70 balls, it was to be New Zealands last success.
Bangladesh won in spite of a desperately poor fielding performance which saw four dropped catches including man of the series Tom Latham before he had scored and again the ball after reaching his 50.
He was eventually bowled by Nasir Hossain, playing his first match of the series, for 84 from 92 balls with 11 fours.
The Black Caps also had a century second wicket stand of 133 between Latham and Neil Broom who was dropped on 56. That miss cost only seven runs as Broom swept to square leg and was well held by the captain. Lathams dismissal still left the Black Caps well placed on 167-3 in the 31th over and on course for a total of 300 but the wicket of the dangerous Corey Anderson led to a collapse - at one stage they lost three wickets for two runs in 11 balls - and it needed Ross Taylor to hold the innings together.
The former captain finished 60 not out, from 56 balls with just six fours, as wickets fell around him. AFP

BCCI raises concerns after Manchester attack
NEW DELHI, Thursday: The Indian cricket board has sent a security officer to England amid concerns over team safety in the Champions Trophy following the Manchester bomb attack.
Acting president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) CK Khanna confirmed to AFP that Neeraj Kumar, security incharge and consultant of its anti-corruption unit, left for England on Tuesday.
Neeraj Kumarji was anyhow supposed to travel with the team but had to go early after the attack, a senior BCCI official told AFP.
He will definitely go to the venues where India is scheduled to play and assess the security, the official added.
Kumar, a former Delhi Police Commissioner, was the head of security when the ICC World T20 Championship was hosted by India last year.
A suicide bomb attack rocked Manchester on Monday, killing 22 people at the end of a concert by US pop star Ariana Grande at Manchester Arena.
All teams are now wary ahead of the 50-over tournament that begins June 1. Holders India start their campaign against arch-rivals Pakistan in Birmingham on June 4.
The BCCI are in touch with the International Cricket Council regarding security in England as Virat Kohli and his side leave for the eight-team event late Wednesday.
We sent out a message (to ICC) raising our concerns about security of the Indian teams travel, accommodation and the playing (area), BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Chaudhary told reporters.
Chaudhary said the ICC responded to it within two hours. They have been sensitised about our concern.
The ICC released a statement Tuesday regarding security measures taken with the England and Wales Cricket Board.
The security situation has been very much front and centre of our preparations and we constantly review our procedures to guarantee they are as effective as possible to keep everyone safe, said an ICC statement. - AFP

BCCI seeks new coach as Kumble term runs out
NEW DELHI, Thursday: Indias cricket board Thursday invited applications for a new head coach, as Anil Kumbles contract draws rapidly to a close.
The former Test captain was appointed coach in June 2016 for a year but will automatically be considered for a renewed term.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has given other interested parties until May 31 to put in their resumes.
The process has been initiated since the term of the current coach, Mr. Anil Kumble concludes with the Champions Trophy, the board stated in a release.
To ensure a fair and completely transparent process, a nominee of the Committee of Administrators (CoA) will oversee the entire process along with the Cricket Advisory Committee, it added.
All applicants will be interviewed by a cricket advisory committee comprising Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman.
The advertised opening comes as India prepares to defend their Champions Trophy title in England. India will kick off their campaign in the eight-team event next week with an opening round match against Pakistan. The BCCI had always stated Kumbles performance would be reviewed after his one-year term, but the timing on the eve of a major event has raised eyebrows.
Local media has reported that Kumble displeased some within the worlds most powerful cricket board when he demanded pay hikes for himself and skipper Virat Kohli, and extra retainer fees for Grade A players.
Kumble spoke to the Committee of Administrators (CoA), while Kohli joined on Skype, asking for 150 per cent hike in the retainership of the Grade A players, reported Indian news website NDTV.
The gutsy cricketer, who captained the Test side for just over a year after replacing Rahul Dravid in 2007, has had a largely successful run on the international coaching circuit.
India has won all their five Test series under Kumble, even beating top sides like England and Australia in a hugely successful home season. - AFP

Blow to big onion farming in Matale
The big onion farmers in the Matale district are inconvenienced due to the inclement weather experienced within the past few weeks. They are unable to commence their onion cultivations yet, they said.
During the last Yala season, about 8,000 acres were brought under big onion cultivation in the district. They reaped over 70,000 metric tons of big onions. It was 40 percent of the annual requirement.
Although the farmers have enough local onion seeds for the current Yala season, they could not prepare even the onion plots so far, under the existing situation.
A farmer in Narangahamula area, H. A. Jayasoma said: My seed onion cultivation was very successful. However, due to the lack of anticipated rain, all our attempts were foiled while sufficient local big onion seeds are available
Another farmer of Thalakiriyagama, W. G. Jayathilaka said: The big onion cultivation in the current Yala season is not satisfactory owing to the inclement weather. We did not prepare even the onion plots.

BOI at Guanxi to boost  Chinese investments to SL
BOI participated at the Guangxi - Sri Lanka Economic and Trade Co-operation Forum and conducted a presentation on the potential for Chinese investments in Sri Lanka.
The leading speaker on the Chinese side was Jiang Liansheng, Director General of the Department of the Commerce of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.
Jiang stated that there is a strategic partnership between China and Sri Lanka as a result of the One Belt and One Road Initiative (OBOR) by the Chinese Government that was held in Beijing recently.
He added that President Xi Jinping had delivered a speech that promoted peace cooperation to help and create mutual benefits. There is also innovation taking place between the different civilisations of the countries of the OBOR initiative. Guangxi is the closest part of China to Sri Lanka with strong links with South Asia and South East Asia.
Guangxi is now the new pole for trade and investment in the coastal development of China. The Autonomous Region is close to Indochina. In that context, Guangxi is an ideal springboard as it is also one of the departure ports of the Maritime Silk Route.
Areas of Cooperation between Guangxi and Sri Lanka include agriculture and especially, tea where Sri Lanka leads in black tea production and Guangxi in Green Jasmine flavoured tea.
Sri Lanka and China are also celebrating 60 years of diplomatic relations and visits such as this one are an excellent opportunity to build up the connectivity between the two countries.
The next step will be the Free Trade Agreement between Sri Lanka and China. This will undoubtedly boost Chinese investments both in the area of FDI and infrastructure.
Chinese Commercial Counselor Yang Zuoyuan also said that Sri Lanka is an important stop on the OBOR. Chinese projects in Sri Lanka include the South Colombo Port, Puttalam coal power station and the NelumPokkuna Theatre, to name just a few.
These projects are a testimony to the great friendship between the people of China and Sri Lanka.
The Colombo Port City and the Hambantota Industrial Park will have a far-reaching impact on Sri Lanka in development terms. They will boost Sri Lanka's economy and create new opportunities.
On the tourism front, Sri Lanka attracted 275,000 Chinese tourists in 2016. China has emerged as Sri Lanka's leading tourism market and flights between the two countries have been increased.
During the OBOR Forum, Sri Lanka was represented by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who led a VIP delegation. Many agreements for cooperation were signed during that visit.
The Counselor concluded by saying that relations between the two countries were expanding and will result in mutual benefits for both China and Sri Lanka.

Britain furious over US leaks on Manchester attack
UK: Furious British officials scolded their US counterparts on Wednesday following repeated leaks of shared material about the investigation into the deadly Manchester terror attack.
British Home Secretary Amber Rudd roasted the US Department of Homeland Security and other intelligence branches after the bombers identity and details of the probe leaked out to US media before British officials felt ready to disclose them.
But shortly after the interior minister complained, The New York Times newspaper again scooped British authorities and other media by publishing photographs from the scene of remnants of the bomb.
The pictures were apparently taken by police investigators and, according to British government ministry sources, leaked by US counterparts they had been shared with.
We are furious. This is completely unacceptable, a government ministry source said.
These images leaked from inside the US system will be distressing for victims, their families and the wider public.
The issue is being raised at every relevant level by the British authorities with their US counterparts. The row -- which goes to the heart of the close intelligence-sharing relationship between the two allies -- provides an awkward backdrop to Prime Minister Theresa Mays meeting with US President Donald Trump at the NATO summit in Brussels on Thursday. Rudd revealed the frustration going on inside the probe to find the suspected network behind bomber Salman Abedi.
The British police have been very clear that they want to control the flow of information in order to protect operational integrity... the element of surprise, Rudd told BBC radio.
So it is irritating if it gets released from other sources and I have been very clear with our friends that that should not happen again.
Asked if the US authorities had compromised the investigation, she said: I wouldnt go that far.
But I can say that they are perfectly clear about the situation and that it shouldnt happen again. But the National Counter Terrorism Policing body said the investigation was being undermined.
We greatly value the important relationships we have with our trusted intelligence, law enforcement and security partners around the world, a spokesman said.
These relationships enable us to collaborate and share privileged and sensitive information.
When that trust is breached it undermines these relationships, and undermines our investigations and the confidence of victims, witnesses and their families.
This damage is even greater when it involves unauthorised disclosure of potential evidence in the middle of a major counter-terrorism investigation. Earlier, US media, also quoting US security sources, identified the assailant as a suicide bomber, well before British authorities confirmed that publicly.
Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan confirmed that Rudd, who spoke with DHS Secretary John Kelly by phone Wednesday, had raised the matter.
They communicated to DHS as well as other US government agencies their concern over leaks about their investigation into the incident in Manchester -- information thats gotten into the press and public through US sources when the UK was leading the investigation and wants to protect the information, Lapan said. - AFP

Meanwhile, the construction work of the weekly pola building at Karametiya in Katuwana is progressing at snails pace for the last four years, traders said.

Why the Buddha is no Lord
At the outset let me thank you for the courage in publishing Upali S. Jayaskeras above captioned letter where he rejects the title LORD referring to Buddha and has correctly explained the historical blunder in identifying the word BUDDHA where he says Buddha is not a proper noun as such. It is a generic noun to refer to one who has obtained Supreme Enlightenment.
Then who is a Lord Lord is an application for a person or deity who has authority, control or power over others; acting like a master, a chief or a ruler. The appellation can also denote certain persons who hold a title of the peerage in the United Kingdom or are entitled to courtesy titles.
In supporting Upali S Jayasekera, let me explain the meaning of the word Buddha. Buddha is derived from the Sanskrit word Buddhi which means wisdom and enlightenment.
It is a title or qualification as much as a doctorate obtained at a university. Then the question arises as to why we Buddhists offer flowers at a statue in temples. Is it to the icon of WISDOM (BUDDHI) or to the person who attained that stage  Prince Siddhartha Gauthama If it is the latter, then the use of the word Buddhism is ambiguous or a misnomer. If that argument or reasoning is accepted, then Buddhism should be identified with Prince Siddhartha Gauthama and termed GAUTHAMISM as much as Christianity, the founder Jesus Christ and Mohammedism with Prophet Mohammed. It would be interesting to have responses to this view.

A clean Champions Trophy says ICC Anti-Corruption chief
ICC Anti-Corruption Unit Chairman Sir Ronnie Flanagans main priority ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy is to ensure that whoever claims the trophy, no team or player is susceptible to any form of corruption.
The eight-team tournament will begin on 1 June as host England takes on Bangladesh at the Oval in London, with a total of 15 games being played over 18 days.
Sir Ronnie, who has been in charge of the Anti-Corruption Unit since 2010, believes that co-operation between players and their representative bodies and the ACU will be crucial in ensuring a corruption-free tournament.
He said: We are one week away from a fantastic Champions Trophy. What a wonderful tournament, the best eight teams in the world for that format of the game, competing in 15 games over 18 days.
Its wonderful for the fans, millions of fans all over the world to have the opportunity to cheer on their team.
Come 18 June at the Oval there can only be one winner. Whats important for the anti-corruption unit is that no matter who is the winner, no matter who has the privilege of taking that trophy home to share the celebrations with their millions of fellow countrymen and women, everybody else in the tournament can say genuinely that they gave their best and that they were not susceptible to any form of corruption.
Thats our job and we want to demonstrate through partnerships through so many people involved, most of all partnerships with the players, through their representative bodies, to demonstrate to the players that we, the ACU, are their friend.
We are there to protect them from the evil and criminal intent of others who would try and lure them into a trap in many ways, to manipulate an event which can facilitate illegal gambling through which organised criminals make a lot of money.
Constant vigilance is the order of the day for Sir Ronnie, and while he explained that there has been no direct intelligence of corruption threats to the tournament, recent history has shown that the ACU cannot afford to relax.
He added: We dont have specific intelligence at this stage of intentions to corrupt the tournament. But that doesnt give us any sense of complacency whatsoever.
We saw recently in the Pakistan Super League in Dubai, instances that we will be guarding against in terms of the attempts to communicate with players and draw players in.
We are very alive to that and very determined to keep it out of this tournament and other subsequent tournaments in the future.
The tournament will also begin in the aftermath of the terrorist attack that hit Manchester this week, which will inevitably have an impact on the security measures at games.
Sir Ronnie urged fans to plan for longer queues and more thorough security searches, but also assured them that they will be safe and secure at all times.

Dead parrot leads to Black Cap Bracewells conviction
WELLINGTON, Thursday: New Zealand fast bowler Doug Bracewell was Thursday sentenced to 100 hours of community service after pleading guilty to drink-driving after dogs ate his pet parrot.
The 26-year-old was more than three times over the New Zealand legal limit when police pulled him over last month. It was his third drink-driving offence in 10 years.
The court was told Bracewell decided to drive home from a function after receiving a call from his distressed partner who told him their pet cockatoo had been killed by dogs they were looking after for a friend.
His lawyer, Ron Mansfield, said the offending was not about a disregard for road rules but came from a genuine concern for his partner.
The cockatoo was of some significance to his partner and she was quite distraught, he said.
Bracewell had previously issued a statement saying he made a massive mistake by driving home.
This was no-ones fault but my own... Im deeply embarrassed to have let down so many people - be they family, friends, or cricket-lovers.
During sentencing, Judge Bridget Mackintosh noted Bracewells two previous drink-driving convictions were somewhat historic but said his alcohol reading was relatively high, and community work was appropriate.
Bracewell, who has taken 72 Test wickets, could have faced up to two years in jail.
He has a history of alcohol-fuelled incidents and was suspended for one Test in 2014 after going on a drinking spree with batsman Jesse Ryder, during which he broke a bone in his foot.
In 2012, he missed the Test series against England after cutting a foot when he stood on broken glass while cleaning up after a party at his house.
Ryder and Bracewell were also suspended for a match in 2012 after an altercation with a bar patron while drinking after a one-dayer against South Africa. - AFP

Dont overtax corporate sector - First Capital CEO
First Capital Equities CEO Jaliya Wijeratne, in a recent interview with Daily News Business, said Sri Lankan policymakers should come out with some strong and permanent economic policies soon.
Currently there are some uncertainties with regard to corporate tax, capital gains tax and several other such areas.
He said that the government needs taxes and it is also a social obligation of the corporate sector to pay them. However the corporate sector should not be overtaxed.
Wijeratne said that it would be a good idea for the government to widen the tax net and rope in several sectors that are currently enjoying a tax-free regime.
He said that due to this both local and foreign investors are adopting a wait-and-see policy and this is not good for the future of the country.
Commenting on the stock market, he said that after a lull, signs are that it would move upward. If you take John Keells shares, it has moved up from around Rs. 130 to over Rs. 160. We also observe an increase in foreign inflows.
He said Sri Lanka needs more listed companies and the government can move in this regard and ask some of the public entities to be listed.
If state banks like the Peoples Bank, Bank of Ceylon and National Savings Bank, along with Sri Lanka Insurance, lists even 15 percent it would be great for the stock market.
He said that there was talk about SriLankan Catering being listed; however it still seems to be confined to discussions.
Wijeratne feels Sri Lanka should go ahead with the lease agreements with China and India for the Hambantota Harbor, Mattala International Airport, Trincomalee Port and other loss-making ventures.
He said that the funds raised from these leases should be diverted to debt repayments, which is now emerging as a major issue.
The First Capital CEO, however, said that Sri Lanka should retain a share or control when leasing out these projects and look at terms favorable for the country.
Commenting on the real estate sector, Wijeratne said that he feels it is not a bubble and demand would continue.
With Sri Lankas population increasing and economy growing, the demand for land would increase. This would help to keep the demand active and aggressive for the apartment segment as well.

DWC to construct more electrified fences island-wide
Human-elephant conflict:
The Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) is to construct 2,000 km of additional electrified fences island-wide to resolve the increasing human-elephant conflict. The island now has 3,500 km of electrified fences.
Surveying and demarcating lands for erecting fences in the Anuradhapura district is now in progress. All 22 Divisional Secretariat Divisions in the district have submitted proposals in this regard. The total distance to be taken for fencing was 800 km and it will cost the government Rs. 500 m. Anuradhapura Wildlife Conservation Assistant Director Weragama said that number of proposals received on erecting fences were not practically possible since some proposed fences will cross, close or block elephant corridors and habitats. Under the Upper Elahara Canal Project, a new fence around 80 km long would be erected connecting the Ritigala and Huruluwewa reservations. It will protect the traditional elephant corridors that elephants lost due to unwarranted Chena cultivations and jungle clearing.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature is funding the project.

He was addressing the 14th International Electoral Affairs Symposium held in association with the Elections Commission in Negombo yesterday.
Deshapriya said the youth are negative about politics and are frustrated as they feel that politicians ignore them.
They have developed a view that politics was boring and complicated which did not act as an incentive to become involved. Manu youths, immaterial of their educational background, have lesser interest in voting. Empowering Young and Future Voters' is a key area," he said.
Deshapriya said the Election Commission has taken measures to enlighten the schoolchildren on democracy and universal franchise in collaboration with the Education Ministry in propagating Student Parliament at school levels.
He said steps must be taken at the national level to increase youth civic engagement.

Export earnings decline  by 2.7 % to US$ 868 mn
Sri Lankas external sector remained subdued with a widening of the trade deficit, a moderation in tourist earnings and a modest growth in workers remittances in February 2017.
A considerable widening in the trade deficit was observed in February with a decline in exports amidst increased imports mainly due to higher imports of fuel and rice. Earnings from tourism dipped with a marginal decline in tourist arrivals during the month, which could partly be attributed to the day time closure of the Bandaranayke International Airport (BIA) for resurfacing of the runway.
The growth in workers remittances in February remained below the expected level. Further, the financial account was adversely affected by significant outflows from the government securities market during the month. However, some foreign investments were observed in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) with inflows to both primary and secondary markets during the month. The pressure on the external account has been eased somewhat in subsequent months by improved export performance; a reversal of capital outflows with investments in the stock exchange and inflows to the government securities market as well as proceeds from the International Sovereign Bond of US dollars 1.5 billion and a syndicated loan of US dollars 450 million.
Earnings from exports at US dollars 868 million in February 2017 registered a decline of 2.7 per cent from US dollars 892 million in February 2016, mainly due to lower industrial exports. Earnings from industrial exports, which represent about 76 per cent of total exports, declined by 6.5 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 659 million in February 2017 mainly due to reduced earnings from textiles and garments. Export earnings from textiles and garments contracted by 14.5 per cent to US dollars 396 million in February 2017 reflecting a significant decline in garment exports to the EU and the USA. Food, beverages and tobacco and gems, diamonds and jewellery also contributed substantially to the lower earnings from industrial exports. However, earnings from machinery and mechanical appliances, petroleum products and rubber products showed an improved performance.
Meanwhile, earnings from agricultural exports grew for the third consecutive month registering an increase of 12.5 per cent to US dollars 205 million in February 2017. Earnings from tea exports increased by 12.8 per cent in value terms due to higher prices, in spite of a decline in the volume exported. Earnings from spices showed a significant growth of 25.7 per cent in February 2017 mainly due to the improved performance in cloves, nutmeg and mace, owing to significant increases in volume despite lower prices. In addition, earnings from seafood exports increased by 27.3 per cent, year-on-year, in February 2017 mainly due to a 111.0 per cent growth observed in seafood exports to the EU. However, earnings from coconuts, minor agricultural products and vegetables exports declined in February 2017.
On a cumulative basis, export earnings during the first two months of 2017 at US dollars 1,733 million, contracted by 3.2 per cent, year-on-year, mainly due to lower exports of textiles and garments, food, beverages and tobacco, gems, diamonds and jewellery and rubber products. However, earnings from machinery and mechanical
appliances, tea and spice exports increased considerably during the period concerned. The leading markets for merchandise exports of Sri Lanka during the first two months of 2017 were the USA, the UK, India, Germany and Italy accounting for about 52 per cent of total exports.
The deficit in the trade balance widened substantially to US dollars 743 million in February 2017 compared to US dollars 548 million in February 2016. The cumulative trade deficit during the first two months of 2017 increased substantially to US dollars 1,677 million from US dollars 1,238 million recorded during the same period of 2016.
The overall Balance of Payment (BOP) is also estimated to have recorded a deficit of US dollars 258.3 million during the year up to end February 2017, compared to a deficit of US dollars 534.0 million recorded up to end February 2016.
The cumulative trade deficit during the first two months of 2017 increased substantially to US$ 1,677 million from US$ 1,238 million recorded during the same period of 2016.

An extra mile to avoid traffic jam
The emergence of highway infrastructure to a country will create so many benefits. The benefits are social, economical and environmental. Sri Lanka can learn many lessons from nearby South Eastern Asian countries of the importance of highways. The highway network accentuates the focus on key highways serving inter- province and international commerce.
The competitiveness of the Sri Lanka in the global marketplace relies upon expectations for improved intermodal linkages between the highway system and other transportation modes. Economic impacts arising from these linkages will yield significant effects on the overall economy, the standard of living of citizens, and the competitiveness of industry.
In order to achieve development as a country, we need to have proper infrastructure in place. The electricity, water, roads, highways, energy like solar, hydropower are the major infrastructures for a country to develop. Sri Lanka is a Lower Middle income country. The policy makers should learn lessons from nearby developed countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia so as to develop infrastructure in Sri Lanka. All these countries maintain highways and it has become one another secret behind their success compared to Sri Lanka.
Less fuel consumption
Sri Lanka needs few more highways such as Colombo  Kandy, Colombo  Dambulla towards Jaffna, Dambulla  Batticaloa, Colombo Ratnapura via Avissawella, Colombo  Matara highway extension up to Hambantota and Kataragama and those should be merged with outer circular highway in Colombo which likes a golden ring. This article will analyze the importance of highways and outer  circular to Sri Lanka.
It reduces travelling time to offices in Colombo or suburbs from far distance locations. There is a tendency in the country, people travel Matara, Galle like long distances to Colombo within 1  hours.
Then, officers do not need to find accommodation from Colombo and will have happy family lives. Their children will be with parents in the night and weekends and saved time can be utilized for worthy matter. This approach will reduce urbanization in the country.
It takes to reach Nittambuwa area from Pettah around three hours during rush hours and also to travel to Moratuwa from Pettah takes same time. This environment creates stressful among people working in Colombo and nearby towns. Benefits as such of southern highway should go to other highways being planned soon as possible since traffic jam increasing day by day.
The accidents are less in highways compared to normal roads. And the vehicles travelling in highways get lesser maintenance costs compared to other roads.
It is a big saving and even fuel consumption less. The usage of highways will add lesser gasses to the environment, so as to reduce environmental pollution. With highways emerging, there are an increased number of vehicles purchasing and it will create an environment of a wealthy family units once again.
Reduce urbanization
Highways with the help of outer-circular can be used for reduced urbanization in Colombo city. The Mattala international airport, Hambantota harbour and other infrastructure in the Southern Province should be utilized in an effective manner to reduce urbanization and the southern highway should be connected with them. This will improve countries export and import potentials so as to increase the Gross Domestic Production (GDP).
There can be many factories opened even in remote areas where highways in near perimeter, a city like Batticaloa, Monaragala. More and more cargo will be able to do shipments to other countries. With the highways, tourism will boom.
Tourists will travel from place to place saving more time for enjoying sites while travelling will be safer. If we can build a Colombo  Jaffna highway, it acts as a platform for peace among communities in the North and South.
There will be a lot of interchanges, goods will be moved fast. A person in Jaffna may come to Anuradhapura within one hour and thirty minutes. There will be a lot of cultural exchange and trust building among communities.

Facts and figures; not mere words and opinions: How has the coal power plant helped economy
It was published in the media that the Power and Energy Authorities are planning to provide Sri Lankans with a lot of energy in the next 20 years and these would also consist of some amount of renewable energy. What needs to be emphasized here is the need to sustain the only firm and dispatchable renewable energy we have got - hydro energy - thanks to the far sightedness of Eng. D.J. Wimalasurendra whose bust is exhibited right in front of the elevators at the Ceylon Electricity Board. This note is an examination of the threats to this renewable energy and real potential of other renewable forms of energy which can be tapped within the next 20 years without impairing the full potential of hydro energy.
Energy and Economy
How a twenty-fold increase in fuel import bill in 14 years from 1999 to 2013 wiped out the benefit of the four-fold increase in apparel exports was described by us in an article in August, 2014. What this fossil fuel economy holds for us is spelt out by the following 1st sentence in the Executive Summary of Energy Outlook - 2009document of International Energy Agency. It is no exaggeration that future of human prosperity depends on how successfully we tackle the following two Central Energy Challenges facing us to-day: (i)Securing Reliable and Affordable Energy and (ii) Rapid Transformation to a Low Carbon, Energy Efficient and Environmentally Benign System of Energy.
What we should do is to accelerate the demolition of this fossil fuel based economy, or tilt the field in the words of Louis Pattler, (in the Book Don't Compete - Tilt the Field)and carve out a sizeable portion - about $ 25 billion exports/economic returns - for Sri Lanka rather than trying to retain the current fossil fuel economy.
How we analyzed these two Central Energy Challenges using the DMADV2 (Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Verify and Validate)methodology in the Six Sigma Toolbox and came out with Highway Solarisation as the appropriate solution was explained in a paper presented at the International Energy Symposium held in Colombo on 27thJune, 2015. This paper was awarded a Certificate of Excellence by the Ministry of Power and Energy.
We studied the relationship between fossil fuel energy usage and economy and we saw that usage of coal influences both our hydro energy and agriculture. Our study of the relationship between coal power and hydroelectricity showed that while we generated 1038GWhr of electricity using coal for the first time in 2011, our hydroelectricity in 2012 dropped to 2009 hours of electricity generation - for the first time - or 2727 GWhrs of electricity while hydro capacity had, actually, increased from 1207MW in 2011 to 1357 MW (increase of 450GWhrs) in 2012. This also depicted the largest decrease of 1300hrs in hydropower generation hours in one single year during the previous 20 years. At the sessions by PUCSL to discuss the Long Term Generation Plan 2015-2035, we mentioned this relationship - Coal Power will reduce Hydro Capacity - and forecasted that actual cost of 1kWhr of coal energy to the economy would be Rs. 30.
The drought of 2014
When the drought of 2014 lowered agriculture production and hydroelectricity, we studied it quantitatively and these findings were published in local press in August, 2016. It showed us that if we operate our coal power plant at 80% capacity utilization (we still have not done this) (a) the CO2 generated will be 6.9 megatons/year, (b) the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere will increase by 23.7 ppm/year, (c) the atmospheric temperature will increase by 2.80C in 8 years (99% certainty), (d) this will increase water in atmosphere by 382.2 km3&(e) if this is sustained for 2 months our hydro capacity in reservoirs will get reduced by 2298 km3.
We computed cost of 1kWhr from coal in 2014 using (a) Cost of coal, (b) Rs. 55 billion loss of agricultural production, (c) 2358 GWhrs of hydroelectricity lost, (d) due to 3202 GWhrs generated by coal and found this cost to be Rs. 86.05/kWhr. In 2016, it may have been as high as Rs. 100/kWhr. While the hydropower capacity increased by 12.5% during the last 10 years the average hydro generation has decreased at the rate of 0.33% per annum during the same period.
Contribution of Coal and Thermal Transportation to our CO2 emissions
People say that CO2 concentration is highest in Kandy, etc. to project that coal power does not contribute to these. We measure CO2 in our atmosphere, in Sri Lanka, at low elevations.Kandy is a city in a valley with mountainous landscape right around it. Vehicular emissions from liquid fuels - with 1 water molecule for every C02 molecule - are considered as line sources leading to vertical dispersion. Dispersion rates depend on diffusivities and densitiesof N2, O2,H2O and CO2 and CO2has the lowest diffusivity and highest density and H2O vapour the highest diffusivity and lowest density. As such CO2 will remain at low elevation till it is absorbed by vegetation. H2O vapour if at a relative humidity of 90% at ground level will be at 100% relative humidity at about 450 meters & condense. Since greenhouse gases produce their greenhouse effectsat higher elevations only, these gases in Kandy will not produce a significant greenhouse effect.
What happens in Norochcholai, flat landscape for miles, is different. Gases leave the chimney at a higher elevation and temperature, vertically with a speed dependent on amount of coal burnt, excess air used, temperature of exhaust and diameter of chimney. After vertically upward movement, it moves at an angle dependent on the wind velocity. In addition to diffusivity and density, the viscosity of the gases will also influence the movement. Since the viscosities of the gases O2, N2, CO2& H2O are in the ratio 29:25:19:13, CO2 and any water vapour (coal has only 2-7 % hydrogen while gasoline and natural gas have 14% and 25% hydrogen)will move up ahead of other gases. These two will bring about greenhouse effect (H2O vapour is also a greenhouse gas) and, the atmospheric temperature goes up. Corresponding to this increase in temperature more water vapour will be required in the atmosphere to maintain constant relative humidity. Since there is not much water vapour coming from coal combustion, this additional water vapour comes from the ground.
Chapter 5 of Frontiers of Climate Modeling by T. Kiehl and V. Ramanathan gives a graph of how (a) Greenhouse Effect, (b) Atmospheric Temperature and (c) Water Vapourat two elevations in the atmosphere exhibit maxima and minima at identical points of time during different months of a year for a particular latitude band which shows that Greenhouse Effect increases atmospheric temperature which increases the water vapour in the atmosphere. When a liquid fuel is used too,CO2 will be generated to a lesser degree - going by theoretical values corresponding to their compositions and calorific values say, 0.25kg CO2/kWh for liquid fuels vs 0.37kg CO2 /kWhr for coal - but some water vapour required to maintain constant relative humidity in the atmosphere at the elevated temperature could be obtained from the combustion of the fuel itself. In the case of coal, CO2 generated is 50% more; temperature increase and corresponding amount of water vapour required will be more while this contribution of H2O is much less and the water vapour has to come from the ground and agricultural production and rainfall will suffer as a result.
Unfortunately, these aspects of climate change have not yet been captured in the LTGP of CEB.
Hydroelectricity lost due to coal combustion
Then we started studying performance of hydroelectric resources further. We saw hydroelectricity fluctuations been attributed to varying rainfall and we decided to check this. We calculated the hydroelectricity hours by dividing the total hydroelectricity generated by the hydroelectricity capacity and calculated the five-year average of these hydroelectricity hours. We are not sure about this five-year average; but hydroelectricity generated from 1992 up to 2000 with a steady 1137 MW capacity,showeda periodicity of 4 or 5 years.We considered hydroelectricity data from 1992 onwards and the two most significant observations are as follows.
(1) During the six years from 2000 to 2005, the hydroelectricity hours remained between 2277hrs to 2774hrs. While this may have been due to our not filling the reservoirs to the full for fears of the reservoir walls been blasted, the strange thing is that once the decision to put up a coal power plant was made in 2005, it again went back to 3554 hours and remained at values above 2774 hours till 2012.
(2) If we eliminate the six years from 2000-2005, the balance 19 years had the lowest hydroelectricity hours between 2000 hours and 2700 hours in the years 1992 (2550 hours), 2012 (2009 hours), 2014 (2637 hours) and 2016 (2569 hours). Three of these including the lowest are since we commenced our coal power plant.
We have calculated the paddy cultivation links to Mahaweli Waters and electricity as well though those details are not indicated here.
Another Coal Power Plant at Sampur
It was recently mentioned that we should establish another Coal Power Plant at Sampur. We don't say or think that we should shut down the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant for reasons considered by us . What we say is that we should operate it at 80% capacity (6307GWhrs) before we start work on another new one. Even in 2016, it generated only 4977 GWhrs.
This new one will be of the same type as the one that is established in Tokyo. My mind goes to that Thermal Sink as mentioned in IPCC Technical Assessment Report 4. On Page 185, it says about Tokyo as follows: The global average anthropogenic heat generated in urban areas is 65Wm-2 and inTokyo it is 400 Wm-2and in some months it could go as high as 1500 Wm-2..We talk about Colombo/Western Megapolis also been made like Tokyo where the population is about 8 million and there being a need of about 35000GWhrs/year of energy. Does not this imply that we should have this coal power plant - if we ever build it - close to Colombo. If we generate 6307GWhrs of coal energy in Sampur and transmit it to Colombo to power the Megapolis, we will lose about 630GWhrs of energy as transmission losses. This deprivation of 630GWhrs of energy to the system will result in a loss of Rs. 63 billion/year to the national economyat the rate of Rs. 100.00 given on Page 6.6 of LTGP - year 2018-2037 as Cost of 1kWhr of Energy Not Served.
We emphasize we should not build a coal power plant at Sampur for the following reasons.
(i) If we operate it at 80% capacity, we would be generating another 6.9megatons of CO2 resulting in the two coal power plants generating close to what we had been generating prior to them (14.98 Mt in 2011)
(ii) Sri Lanka's overall emission rate above our 65000km2 land scape will be about 443tons/km2 which is 6 times the global average.
(iii) Exhaust air from this coal power plant at Sampur containing 6.9Mtpa of CO2 would move westward and create a desert in the landscape - consisting of Anuradhapura, Dambulla&Polonnaruwa - considered significant in respect of cultural & agricultural importance. Dr. Noel de Nevers on pages 85 & 109 of his book Air Pollution Control Engineering emphasizes that in the absence of cyclones or similar phenomenon, the air movement in this region will be in the westward direction.
(iv) As we have mentioned earlier, this proposed coal power plant will definitely bring about unbearable reductions in our hydroelectricity generation and agricultural production. We will also lose our north-eastern monsoon rains.
Making CEB Profitable
We were surprised by what we saw in the Central BankAnnual Report - 2016. CEB which made a profit of Rs. 19.4 billion in 2015 made a loss of Rs. 13.2billion in 2016, while CPC which made a loss of Rs. 19.9 billion in 2015 made a profit of Rs. 69.6 billion. The unfortunate thing is that CEB may have contributed to both these - the loss at CEB & profit at CPC and also to country sending about $183 million of foreign exchange out and the Sri Lankan rupee falling down.
An entity planning to improve profitability should look at slabs of their expenditure at the highest levels. During President J.R. Jayawardena's time, his sister-in-law, late Dr. Mrs. L.G. Jayawardena wanted to improve profitability of State Pharmaceuticals Corporation where she was the Chairman and it was entrusted to me as Systems Analyst. We identified items which contributed the most to the cost structure and for about 24 months thereafter, till I left, I had to recommend the quantity to be imported and the number of instalments in every Tender Schedule and sign off, not only for those items, but for every item whether for the private sector or for the Government Medical Stores. Those expensive stocks were always brought in 4 instalments. We succeeded in reducing the stockholding of SPC from $7 million to $4 million during those two years with no increase in the stock out situation and I believe that the corporation may have got privatizedif not for thatsuccess.
So what we recommend to the CEB is always attempt to reduce the use of most expensive forms of energy. If we look at the two years 2015 and2016, we see that the consumption has gone up by 1061 GWhrs from 13088GWhrs to 14149GWhrs. Did they manage to get that extra 1330GWhr from coal Where did they go to get this extra energy - excess demand of 1061GWhrs + 1367GWhrs of hydropower lost - 534GWhrs extra from coal + some other losses may be from mini hydro. They got 2304GWhrs more from oil - may be at an average cost of Rs. 31.00/kWhr; i.e. from the most expensive source.Of course, they had no options for they had not planned for any options. Are you surprised that CEB made that loss and CPC a profit
What could they have done That is where the forecasting and long-term generation planning comes in. When you are dependent on hydro for about 35% of your electricity requirement, you need to look at alternative natural sources which will give higher yields when hydro goes down. This would automatically direct you towards solar. In expanding our power generation base, our first priority should become solar as during the last 10 years our average hydro generation growth rate has been negative in spite of capacity augmentations. If, instead of that, we give priority to coal, the enemy of hydro, in a few years time the negative hydro generation growth rate will go beyond 1% per annum. Then we need to check what its strengths and weaknesses are and see how we could exploit the strengths and make weaknesses irrelevant. We will see two weaknesses. Weaknesses in lack of dispatchability and firmness and non-availability during night time where the current peak is. Please note that daytime peak is increasing and in 2030,it will be higher than nighttime peak.

It was published in the media that the Power and Energy Authorities are planning to provide Sri Lankans with a lot of energy in the next 20 years and these would also consist of some amount of renewable energy. What needs to be emphasized here is the need to sustain the only firm and dispatchable renewable energy we have got - hydro energy - thanks to the far sightedness of Eng. D.J. Wimalasurendra whose bust is exhibited right in front of the elevators at the Ceylon Electricity Board. This note is an examination of the threats to this renewable energy and real potential of other renewable forms of energy which can be tapped within the next 20 years without impairing the full potential of hydro energy.
Energy and Economy
How a twenty-fold increase in fuel import bill in 14 years from 1999 to 2013 wiped out the benefit of the four-fold increase in apparel exports was described by us in an article in August, 2014. What this fossil fuel economy holds for us is spelt out by the following 1st sentence in the Executive Summary of Energy Outlook - 2009document of International Energy Agency. It is no exaggeration that future of human prosperity depends on how successfully we tackle the following two Central Energy Challenges facing us to-day: (i)Securing Reliable and Affordable Energy and (ii) Rapid Transformation to a Low Carbon, Energy Efficient and Environmentally Benign System of Energy.
What we should do is to accelerate the demolition of this fossil fuel based economy, or tilt the field in the words of Louis Pattler, (in the Book Don't Compete - Tilt the Field)and carve out a sizeable portion - about $ 25 billion exports/economic returns - for Sri Lanka rather than trying to retain the current fossil fuel economy.
How we analyzed these two Central Energy Challenges using the DMADV2 (Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Verify and Validate)methodology in the Six Sigma Toolbox and came out with Highway Solarisation as the appropriate solution was explained in a paper presented at the International Energy Symposium held in Colombo on 27thJune, 2015. This paper was awarded a Certificate of Excellence by the Ministry of Power and Energy.
We studied the relationship between fossil fuel energy usage and economy and we saw that usage of coal influences both our hydro energy and agriculture. Our study of the relationship between coal power and hydroelectricity showed that while we generated 1038GWhr of electricity using coal for the first time in 2011, our hydroelectricity in 2012 dropped to 2009 hours of electricity generation - for the first time - or 2727 GWhrs of electricity while hydro capacity had, actually, increased from 1207MW in 2011 to 1357 MW (increase of 450GWhrs) in 2012. This also depicted the largest decrease of 1300hrs in hydropower generation hours in one single year during the previous 20 years. At the sessions by PUCSL to discuss the Long Term Generation Plan 2015-2035, we mentioned this relationship - Coal Power will reduce Hydro Capacity - and forecasted that actual cost of 1kWhr of coal energy to the economy would be Rs. 30.

Weaknesses in lack of dispatchability and firmness and non-availability during night time where the current peak is. Please note that daytime peak is increasing and in 2030,it will be higher than nighttime peak.
Way Forward
With day time peak of say 700MW above the base load - let coal power (firm, but not despatchable) handle this baseload to the maximum possible - for 10 hrs from 8.30 to 18.30 on 365 days would account for 2555GW/year. With about 700MW of solar yielding 1500hrs/year PV solar could have handled 1050GWhrs. Even if CEB paid Rs. 25/kWhr for this it would have saved CEB Rs. 6.3 billion/year. It is very important that we develop all technologies related to solar as in 2030 we will be having a day time peak of 4726MW. Sri Lanka gets about 118,625TWhrs/yearof solar energy out of which a significant portionis wasted - or rather allowed to contribute to global warming - unlike the balance which keeps us comfortably warm at near 280C, provides us light, get us agricultural products, keep the water cycle running. This enormous solar energy input need to be harnessed so that the peak energy demand from 2030 onwards could be met from the same. By 2030 we should be able to develop 3800MW of PV Solar Power or 5700GWhrs of SolarEnergy on the highways which will have the ability to pay back all the loans taken on highway construction while negating at least 50% of environmental damage due to construction and usage of highways. These are all verifiable, measurable data if only one is patient to read, understandand calculate.
Sometime back, in early 2015, Dr. T. Siyambalapitiya wrote to the papers saying that when CEB makes good profits due to excess hydroelectricity been generated, or oil been cheaper the benefits arising from this should be shared with the customers. When I was reading it, my mind went back to my days at Haycarb,where the then Managing Director, Mr. RajanYatawara used to resist all attempts at board level to distribute excessive profits resulting from cheap coconut shell charcoal (raw material for activated carbon)amongst shareholders as increased dividends. He would always say that we needed to preserve it for that rainy day when the prices would be higher or market would be lackluster and would invest the same in development work. These decisions preserved the entity to this day while many of its competing, global players had gone into oblivion.
On this line of thought we would suggest that whenever we get above average hydro energy, we invest such savings/profits in developing solar energy rather than oil or coal. But we should keep on developing other large non-coal, thermal units to provide firm, despatchable energy to support these large scale solar installations. Then we will have a solar + hydro combination to provide us a steady 12000GWhrs/year supply and about 18000GWhrs/year from thermal (coal, gas and oil) to top up while we will have other sources of energy such as wind, biomass and solid waste to support. We need to remember that, oil & gas will generate a large proportion of water vapour required to maintain the constant relative humidity corresponding to the elevated temperatures from higher CO2 concentrations due to the fossil fuel combustion unlike coal which generates only a meagre quantity of water vapour and balance has to come from the ground disrupting both agriculture and hydro power.
With day time peak of say 700MW above the base load - let coal power (firm, but not despatchable) handle this baseload to the maximum possible - for 10 hrs from 8.30 to 18.30 on 365 days would account for 2555GW/year. With about 700MW of solar yielding 1500hrs/year PV solar could have handled 1050GWhrs. Even if CEB paid Rs. 25/kWhr for this it would have saved CEB Rs. 6.3 billion/year. It is very important that we develop all technologies related to solar as in 2030 we will be having a day time peak of 4726MW.

We need to remember that, oil & gas will generate a large proportion of water vapour required to maintain the constant relative humidity corresponding to the elevated temperatures from higher CO2 concentrations due to the fossil fuel combustion unlike coal which generates only a meagre quantity of water vapour and balance has to come from the ground disrupting both agriculture and hydro power.

Fiery killer!
A chef has developed the worlds hottest chilli pepper - and its so fiery it could kill you.
The record-breaking chilli - Dragons Breath - was developed to be used in medical treatment as an anaesthetic because the oils that come from it are so potent that they can numb the skin.
Mike Smith, from St Asaph in North Wales, has been growing chillies and vegetables for the last seven years, the Daily Post reports .
It measures more than 2.48m on the Scoville scale, and it could potentially cause a type of anaphylactic shock for someone who eats it, burning the airways and closing them up.
The US military uses pepper spray which registers at around 2m on the Scoville scale.
Mr Smith, 53, said: Its not been tried orally. Ive tried it on the tip of my tongue and it just burned and burned. I spat it out in about 10 seconds.
The heat intensity just grows.
The Dragons Breath is so powerful that one drop of its capsicum oil would be detectable in 2.48m drops of water.
Mr Smith added that the chilli - created in partnership with Nottingham Trent University - has a medicinal use.
He said: This was developed because a lot of people are allergic to anaesthetic, and this can be applied to the skin because it is so strong it numbs it.
As well as being of use in treating people who are allergic to anaesthetics, it is thought the chillis oils could also be useful in developing countries, where access to anaesthetic is limited for financial reasons.
The Dragons Breath chilli is so potent that it has to be kept in a specially sealed container.
It will be on display at the Chelsea Flower Show between May 23 and 27.

First ladies sleepwear by Mackly
Premium sleepwear label Mackly will launch its first collection of ladies sleepwear together with its latest childrens collection with a runway event at Park Street Mews on June 18. Macklys lineup of models will include young children and women who will walk the runway in 100% cotton pyjamas and nightgowns designed for stylish comfort.
Mackly Sleepwear is especially designed for tropical weather with 100% breathable cotton material. Each piece goes through a needle and metal detector for safety, and is phthalate and allergy free. All t-shirts have heat seals in place of labels to avoid discomfort at the back of the neck, and each piece is tested for colour fastness and shrinkage. Mackly Sleepwear for kids cater to three age groups; 2-5 years, 5-8 years and 8-14 years. The label also offers a small range of cotton knitted eye masks for deeper, uninterrupted sleep.
The ladies sleepwear line builds on these features to bring functional style to the table. The founder and lead designer Sharmila Srikumar is responding to overwhelming interest from her clients and others who have been pressing her to design a sleepwear line for an older audience. The extra comfort of our sleepwear and the high standards we maintain when designing and manufacturing Mackly clothing meant that a lot of mums were requesting that we design sleepwear for them too, she said in a press release. But weve also been playing with some ideas for trendy sleepwear for women for a while now and this felt like a very good time to act on it and launch the line.
Srikumar adds that this new sleepwear range will bring the same comfort and safety standards of the childrens range with an on-trend focus in order to bring the changing contours and styles of fashion seasons to customers.
The ladies range will be available in small, medium and large sizes with larger sizes to be introduced soon.

First tower of Dusit Thani's Beachfront Balapitiya sold out
One tower of Dusit Thani Sri Lanka's Beachfront Balapitiya was sold out last week stamping investor confidence, not only for the project but also for Sri Lanka.
This 14-floor beachfront tower consists of 44 apartments.
Indola Group Director Ajit Wijesinghe said that one-third of the second tower which is being built under the first stage too has been sold.
The buyers are Sri Lankan expatriates and surprisingly foreigners, some whom have not even visited Sri Lanka.
Wijesinghe said that they have a very strong marketing arm and had done several road shows in London, Australia and other countries which resulted in the sale of apartments. Some apartments were also purchased upfront, he said
Wijesinghe said that the buyers were from Australia, the UAE, Japan, the UK and Singapore.
In a bid to attract more buyers we will be hosting another road show at Mandarin Orchard Hotel, Singapore in Saturday (27)."
He said that one of the biggest selling points of Dusit Thani Sri Lanka's Beachfront Balapitiya was the high return of investment.
Investors receive a freehold title and guaranteed returns of 6% nett per annum for five years that is paid quarterly in US dollars.
There is the potential of approximately 30% in capital gains over two years and no ongoing costs at all.
Additionally, apartment owners can use their apartment up to 21 days per annum free of charge.
Construction of the project has already started and the major contract was awarded to Sino Great Wall International Engineering Pvt Ltd (SGW) from China.
The project is being developed over three phases including a promenade featuring 15 international restaurants, cafes and bars, a luxury spa, sauna and gymnasium, 2,500 sq. metre convention centre, five swimming pools (including a rooftop infinity pool), a rooftop tennis court, a multi-faith chapel, 24/7 concierge, luggage, and security and valet services.
Sino Great Wall International Engineering is a listed company on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and has many years of experience in construction, particularly in the overseas market.
One of the reasons we chose Sino Great Wall Engineering is their experience in building five-star hotels around the world.
The five-star property is designed by renowned Singaporean architectural firm Design Team 3 and managed by Thai hotel and apartment operators, Dusit International, one of the world leaders in authentic Thai hospitality.
Located on 500 metres of absolute pristine beachfront, each of the 514 apartments will feature a large private balcony, f-star designer interiors and stunning, uninterrupted ocean views.
The project is Sri Lankas one and only luxury beachfront high-rise investment apartments.
The event reaffirmed The Beachfront as Sri Lankas soon to be go to destination with the property scheduled to open in end 2018. SS

Fonterra's Rs 2 bn for sustainable  growth in dairy value chain
Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka is seeing sustainable returns from its ten-year plan to build a thriving dairy industry and improve access to locally-made dairy products.
The dairy cooperative behind Anchor recently surpassed the Rs. 2 billion investment mark, which has contributed a strong and sustainable wave of change.
It has done this through upskilling thousands in the industry and introducing game-changing supply chain innovations to deliver high-quality nutrition to Sri Lankans.
The latest initiatives, which are part of Fonterras decade-long Rs. 10 billion commitment, include training and education for thousands of farmers, expanded processing capacity for local dairy products, and infrastructure development projects that have so far touched the lives of more than tens of thousands of people in Fonterras dairy communities.
Managing Director of Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka and the Indian Subcontinent, Sunil Sethi, said that the dairy cooperative is focused on enabling the countrys dairy industry to better meet national nutritional requirements and become an active contributor to the economy.
With the local dairy industry meeting just 30 percent of current consumer demand, the industry has immense potential for growth. Realising this potential, our accelerated development efforts aim to support small-scale dairy farmers to build and maintain profitable and sustainable farm businesses, said Sethi.
One such project is Fonterras Rs. 117 million Demonstration and Training Farm in Pannala  a first-of-its-kind private sector initiative established last year to share dairy best practices in farm management.
In its first year of operation, the facility reached more than 3,500 dairy farmers, veterinarians, Livestock Development Instructors (LDIs), and university students through its training and education programmes.
Furthermore, over Rs.100 million has been invested on farmer training through Fonterras Supplier Relationship Offices (SROs) who are dedicated to working closely with dairy farmers to increase their incomes through milk quality and productivity improvements.
Another key area of focus is future-proofing the industrys supply chain.
Setting up suitable infrastructure for storage and transportation is vital in safeguarding the quality of our farmers milk for the long-term. For that reason, weve invested in state-of-the-art milk chilling centres in our dairy communities and equipped them with advanced testing equipment, said Sethi.
As part of this programme, in 2017 Fonterra invested more than Rs. 50 million to set up the right milk collection and transport infrastructure. It recently established a network of new milk chilling centres in the North Western Province, introduced milk testing and chilling technology to the country and strengthened cold-chain transportation and logistics for fresh dairy products.
To ensure local farmers can help meet the evolving nutritional needs of Sri Lankans, Fonterra has also invested Rs.1 billion this year in upgrading its local manufacturing footprint to add capacity for existing fresh dairy products and prepare for some exciting innovations to grow the fresh dairy products category.
A further Rs. 35 million has gone towards creating lasting changes in the lives of dairying communities through more than 50 infrastructure projects to date. Enhancing the lives of people in our dairy communities is a significant element of achieving our purpose to build a healthier and happier Sri Lanka. We formed the Fonterra Grass Roots Fund in 2014 with this intention and have already seen sustainable changes through some 50 community projects around water, sanitation and infrastructure development, said Sethi.

The Food Trolley Club..!
Youve all seen it happen on flights, and youll agree with me when I say that a nightmare faced by airhostesses quite often, other than hijacks and terrorist attacks are people who want to walk past the food trolley to the toilet when food is being served! I was talking to Anne a pretty young flight steward, and she swore people did it on purpose and there was some sinister motive behind it.
I sat on a flight the other day and decided to watch.
Nobody stirred while the plane was taxing to the runway, and nobody dared get up while the aircraft took off. There was a general calm as the plane leveled off and my neighbour, who I'd never met before told me the news in his paper was better than mine."How do you know" I asked surprised.
"I buy the paper," he said, "and it's sensational! Rapes, murders and that sort of thing! You like stuff like that"
"I'm not sure," I said and settled down to hear a long monologue on the subject, when suddenly his ears perked up."Food trolley!" he whispered.
"Yes," I said, "I hope its something tasty."
"Food trolley!" he said again and I swear his eyes lit up like a BMW's headlights on a moonless night.
"You hungry" I asked.
He didn't answer as he got up. I got up to let him out and was in time to see the dismay in the poor airhostess's eyes. "Sir can you wait a few minutes"
"Wait" he asked, "you want me to wait I've been waiting enough! You took a little longer today!"
"Why don't you wait till she's passed," I said quietly.
"I have to go to the toilet!" he stage-whispered and all the other passengers looked at him sympathetically and stared daggers at the airhostess and me.
"Maybe he's diabetic!" said one.
"They should be more considerate!" said another.
The man brushed by me and tried to sidle past the trolley.
"Sir you can't."
"I will!" said my former companion.
"You're stuck!"
"You did it on purpose! I just want to go to the toilet! I will sue the airline! What is your name"
Another attendant rushed in and together they managed to pull the trolley back to the end of the aircraft while my companion walked regally behind. He came back later flushed and happy.
"Couldn't you have waited" I asked.
"That's not part of the rules!" he said.
"Rules" I asked.
"Walking Past the Trolley Club! We have our rules" he said, "want to join"
I met Anne who had told me about such people and told her about the club.
"We broke the club!" she said a week later.
"How" I asked amazed, "What do you tell them when they want to walk past the trolley"
"Sir!" she said, "will you please sit down; here's a bed pan for you if its really urgent..!"

Fresh indictment on Aluthgamage
A fresh indictment was yesterday served on former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage.
This is for allegedly purchasing a house worth Rs.27 million at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 following a complaint that he had allegedly purchased properties through illegally acquired money.

Fruitarian gran turns back the clock
A glamorous gran who lives on a diet of fruit said her new lifestyle has left her with the body of an athlete.
Belinda White, who calls herself a fruitarian, became a vegan overnight after learning about nutrition when training to become a yoga teacher. The extreme lifestyle haul didnt go down well with her family at first, who enjoyed a treat of burgers and ice cream. But Belinda, 46, credits her diet to making her look half her age - and proudly claimed shes the female Benjamin Button.
The mum-of-three now survives on fruit - also snacking on some veg and nuts - and eats up to 20 pieces a day.
She said: I am the female Benjamin Button.
Her partner of four years, engineer Jason Holden, 37, and two youngest boys, Tom, 18, and Joe, 13, were initially reluctant. But singer Belinda, of Rotherham, South Yorks., was so passionate about the ban, she considered splitting up with meat-loving Jason if he didnt adopt her new way of life.
She won him and the boys over and now, two years after the shakeup, they eat a completely vegan diet while Belinda, is a fruitarian. Belinda, whose favourite fruit is mango, says the diet has boosted her energy levels, cured her fibromyalgia and reduced her pain from osteoarthritis by 95 per cent.
But above all, she says ridding her body of animal products has made her cellulite dissolve, improved her hair, skin and nails and made her look decades younger.
Healthy lifestyle
Belinda, who has a grandson called Theo after her eldest son, Daniel White, 26, became a dad six weeks ago, said: I feel better in every way. It is almost like returning to my youth.
I feel like I have turned the clock backwards. Its incredible. I look like Im 28 but Im 46. Ive lost about two stone and my partner lost around two stone and had terrible psoriasis all over his body which has now cleared considerably. Before, I just felt old. I couldnt get up the stairs because I was in so much pain due to the osteoarthritis in my hips and I was on three different pills a day. Since doing this, I take no medication and Im teaching yoga four times a week. My physical body has gone like it was when I was in my twenties. My cellulite has dissolved and my pain from osteo arthritis has been reduced by 90 per cent.
Belinda said she and her family always lived what they thought was a healthy lifestyle, limiting red meat, eating chicken and fish and avoiding junk food binges.
But instead of having a bacon roll for breakfast, she now eats half a watermelon and drinks a water with lemon juice which acts like an internal body wash.
She then heads to work armed with two giant flasks of smoothies, packed with eight bananas, dates and frozen fruit like mangoes for lunch, instead of a Greggs.
For dinner, she eats avocados, cherry tomatoes, mung beans and peppers, washed down with a huge glass of orange juice.
When she fancies a treat, she gorges on energy balls of medjool dates, cashew nuts, raw cocoa powder and coconut which taste like Ferrero Rochers.
Though theyve now accepted the new diet and way of life now, Belinda said Jason and her boys didnt like it at all at first.
High cholesterol
She said: I was so strong about it that I was prepared to end my relationship with him, which sounds extreme. But to be intimate with someone and share the body smells... When you become a vegan, especially when your diet is clean, you dont have the same BO or breath.
Belinda claims that even her doctors have been blown away by the improvement in her health.
She said: A few years ago, I would have considered veganism to be very extreme. But the effects on me have been amazing. I feel more like I have halted the ageing and I am now turning the clock back. I got a doctor to test everything and my results were just so good and incredible that the hospital said I was like an athlete.
Belinda said that watching documentaries, including Vegucated and Earthlings, showed her that we are conditioned and brainwashed as children to eat this way.
She said: I realised that the number one killer in our country is heart disease caused by high cholesterol and in my opinion, meat and dairy cause this type of blockage. I thought, how can I justify teaching people about peace, kindness and love and then sit and eat an innocent animal that died a horrific death and feed it to my children People should do what Ive done because I believe that each and every person who hears this, something inside them realises that it is the truth.
Every single person deserves the right to a healthy life. I want to be the example. I want people to see me and my children and be inspired. Anyone who is suffering should try this as something inside of you instinctively knows it will help.
The results of a full blood count taken from Belinda in May show that she is perfectly healthy and thriving on her fruitarian diet.
Nutritionist Nicola Burgher-Kennedy said eating an all-fruit diet can help you shed the pounds.
It is possible that eating an all fruit diet can cause some weight loss because fruits are low in fat and calories, she said.
You can also get the benefits of a healthy weight from consuming a healthy balanced diet as well as obtaining the nutrients the body needs to be healthy and happy.
She added that fruits also provide antioxidants and phytonutrients which can reduce the risk of chronic diseases like some cancers.

Great potential for Israel, SL relations
Interview with Israel Ambassador to India and Sri Lanka Daniel Carmon:
Israel Ambassador to India and Sri Lanka Daniel Carmon is on a three day visit to Sri Lanka to work on a few initiatives to improve bilateral relations between the two countries. In an interview with the Daily News, the Ambassador spoke on the potential to do many things that are important for both countries.
Ambassador Carmon has served in the diplomatic field for 44 years and was appointed as an Ambassador to India and Sri Lanka in 2014.
The following are excerpts of the interview:
Q: What is the purpose of your visit to Sri Lanka
A: This is my seventh visit to Sri Lanka in two and a half years, due to the fact that we don't have a residence embassy. The aim of our mission is to put content which would suit both Sri Lanka and Israel. Bilateral relations between the countries has been improving dramatically for many years.
I visit Sri Lanka with my colleagues in Delhi for three to four days. We meet as many people as we can. We also have discussions with the government officials, ministries and ministers.
Q: How do you see the relationship between Sri Lanka and Israel
A: In the last few decades, we have seen ups and downs. There were times when we had resident diplomatic missions here in Sri Lanka. We had less than better times in the past but I think last few years we are in the upswing enjoying a very good relations.
There is potential to do many activities together that are important for both countries. Those areas are always on the discussion table between us and our counterparts in the Ministries. We are looking for right partners and possible areas that we can work together.
In Israel, the private sector is something that we encourage very much. Private sector is showing more greater interest in upgrading its connectivity. There are many initiatives by companies and individuals.
There are many Israeli businessmen who are very active in Sri Lanka. But, I see a lot of enthusiasm
growing for Israelis to do business in Sri Lanka.
Q: What are the initiatives taken to improve bilateral relations
A: We have taken a few initiatives in the field of agriculture which are very important to Sri Lanka. We have the expertise and knowledge and we are ready to share it with the Sri Lankan government. We will push and promote as much as we can. Another important area which we have seen more interest from Israeli citizens is tourism.
We hear that increasing numbers of Israeli tourists are visiting Sri Lanka. It has become a very popular destination for Israeli tourists. Sri Lanka is definitely on the map for Israeli tourists.
The economic situation in Israel allows Israelis to spend one or two vacations abroad.
This is something that both governments should encourage. Bilateral relations in diplomacy are not confined only to talk about high politics but also to promote people to people connections and development projects whilst encouraging the areas of mutual concern between the two parties.
Despite the fact that we are not present here by permanent basis, we are trying to do it from Delhi. Potential is much greater than what we are doing now.
Q: Why is there no embassy on a permanent basis in Sri Lanka
A: There were various political reasons for not having an embassy on a permanent basis. We had some issues but they are now in the past. The decision to open a diplomatic mission has also to do with budget and technicalities. I believe that some conditions that needs to be done within Israel would be met. On two different occasions, we had the diplomatic missions in Sri Lanka. At this stage we have no plans to
establish an embassy on a permanent basis but it has got nothing to do with Sri Lanka. For various reasons,
the numbers of Israeli missions were smaller during the last few years. We have closed some missions
worldwide as well.
I think we can also work well together even without a residence embassy. But, we only have to find the right partners, we have to define and identify the areas of mutual concern and interest.
Q: What are the areas of interest for both countries
A: Israel is not investing compared to other countries. We are not bringing bigger investments to the table.
Even Israeli private companies are not investing abroad. What we bring is technology, knowledge and
experience. We built a nation from scratch, and we had to deal with food security, water scarcity as the majority of our territory is a desert, but with all these challenges we built our nation. Thousands of Sri Lankans have been to Israel for training in our laboratories. These activities might not be big in magnitude, but we talk about individual and group training. Training was held in the field of agriculture, health, water management, regional planning and food security.
Majority of the Sri Lankans work in Israel as care givers and in the agricultural sector. Its a win win situation for both countries. We know how important it is for the Sri Lankan community as well as economy.
There is a community of Sri Lankan workers in Israel. I think we should promote this more. A little more than an year ago, we started a pilot project. Earlier it was in the hands of private entrepreneurs.
Now we have started a government to government project. The Ministry of Foreign Employment is functioning well, I think.
We have signed an agreement with them on a joint pilot project with periodical agricultural workers.Things between the two governments are going well.
Q: Any plans to improve the trade relationship between the two countries
A: Not for now, but we are on the verge of renewing two intergovernmental mechanisms. One is political dialogue between the two foreign ministries. A joint economic committee is set to meet in the foreseeable future.
Q: How do you see American President Donald Trumps visit to the Middle East
A: The speech that President Trump made in Saudi Arabia was very important, his views and thoughts on
encouraging the Arab world to counter terrorism and drive terrorism out. His whole trip has a very great significance. But, with regard to Israel, the Palestinian political process will have to wait to see the result of the visit. However, still there is hope that the stalled process will advance because the region needs better times.
President Trump sent an important message concerning Iran as well. Iran does not only threaten Saudi and
the Gulf states, it also threatens Israel. I think the President's message was well received.
Q: President Trump also asked Israel to hold back on settlement building on the West Bank. Your opinion on that
A: We have to wait and see what was said, we are not only talking about the speeches. We will see what the after visit effect is and where will we go from now.
Q: The peace discussions with Israel and Palestine authorities have been stalled since 2014. How do you see this coming
A: There are many channels of discussions between us and the Palestinian authority. Some of which has to do with civilian affairs and many things are happening on those grounds. A week ago, an important Israel and Palestine committee met to discuss many issues. The political discussion of course was halted. Rather than trying to look back and finding who is at fault, I think we all should give a chance to President Trumps visit.
We all look at President Trumps visit in a very positive way. It was a visit of a true friend and we have
very good relations with the US in all aspects.
Q: President Trump said all Muslim countries should come together and combat terrorism. Do you see this possibility
A: The issue of terrorism is something that each country has to confront by itself, but its not enough. Countries should unite whilst improving the efforts, mechanisms and coordination between them.
Coordination and cooperation is super important between nations. President Trump also clearly explained that the tragedy was that the majority of the victims of Islamic terrorism were Muslims.
Q: Do you think Israel has good connection between Muslim countries
A: I am sure that the old equation of Arab or Muslims on one side and Jews or Israel on the other side has changed and it is no longer what it used to be. Things have changed because the challenges also have changed. We have attained peace treaties with two major Arab countries, Egypt and Jordan. We have similar interests between Israel and some other Muslim countries which traditionally were on the other side. Their challenges are very similar to ours, definitely the fight against terrorism. We have a long way to go though.
Now the world and the region have changed, we have to look for common interest to bring peace, security and prosperity as President Trump said, we all can contribute to that, but the paradigm of what used to be has changed. One has to be only hopeful in this regard. It has changed and affected the international politics which is changing its nature also. We are not only talking about the traditional international relations but we are putting more content which is very important to all. Though I am not a resident Ambassador, I am trying to coordinate with my colleagues and counterparts to promote a web of relations that would support Sri Lanka as well as Israels economy.

Hemas provides drinking water  to schoolchildren in NCP
Clogard, the flagship product of Hemas Manufacturing, initiated on a novel campaign to provide underprivileged children with a heavy metal water filter fulfilling a vital need for healthy living. This CSR initiative was instigated by Clogard Fresh Blast Gel.
Hemas Manufacturing is the first Sri Lankan company to produce a gel toothpaste; Clogard Fresh Blast Gel manufactured with a combination of natural ingredients and opta zinc technology to fight germs providing long lasting fresh breath. Young people especially, seek the confidence that fresh breath provides, enabling them to interact closely and speak with people of all ages.
The Clogard Fresh Blast Gel team visited a small school in North Central Province (NCP) and witnessed the debilitating situation caused by dental fluorosis due to contaminated drinking water.
Prior to the installation of the water filer, residents faced severe hardships in accessing drinking water and having to pay for clean drinking water. However, to cook and clean they continued to use contaminated water resulting in irreparable dental issues.
Clogard Fresh Blast Gel wanted to reach out to these children to do what we can do to mitigate the damage done, especially to encourage school children to brush with a fluoridated toothpaste to help strengthen their tooth enamel, preventing tooth decay, said Shanadi Liyanage, Assistant Brand Manager, Oral Care Hemas Manufacturing.
Clogard Fresh Blast Gels campaign invited the public to get involved to wish these children by embracing values of saying it fresh by submitting wishes to a booth located at Majestic City.
The inauguration ceremony was held recently at the school attended by several provincial officials, school officials, students, parents and well-wishers.
Clogard Fresh Blast Gel also conducted a free dental clinic via its mobile dental truck. The children received advice including the importance of brushing and inculcating dental hygiene.

The King of  Parks
Circling eagles overhead and fluttering Kingfishers, rain in on the dry vegetation, where you will come across the occasional group of elephants drinking in the tanks. Within twenty minutes one realizes the massive range of endemic birds that can be found here and are a huge feature of Lahugala Kitulana. One of the relatively tiny natural reserves that as a result of being shut for years has little or no tourism. The majestic black tuskers can be seen particularly in August when sometimes herds of 150 to 200 hundred of them leave the scorches of the irradiant sun, heaving their weighty and hefty gait through the sluggish abandonments of the banks of the former irrigation tanks, which are great spots to animal watch and enjoy the pink water lilies that would have sent even Monet the artist into raptures.
The mixed evergreen
Peacocks can be found calling for a mate from the tree tops and the underbrush lush with the spindly vertical vertebrae of the jade green bera grass shoots bursting out of the ground as there is really not much for the animals to do here other than go about their daily affairs, in the dense thickets and wide open heartlands of the park. Near Pottuvil, although Lahugala may not quite be on the off road safari trekkers choice of destinations list, it is an overlooked gem as the sheer volume of bird life makes it a tweeters paradise ranging from magpies, malkohas, jacanas, orioles, herons, shikras, kites, pelicans, storks, lesser adjutants, openbills, spurfowls, ibises, swifts, parrots, little green bee eaters, spotted doves, barbets and parakeets is what makes this a must see park.
The National Park guide who you can pick up at the entrance when you pay the park fees is a brilliant addition as they know the park inside out and will stop at look out points and show you the habitat of the egrets, lesser whistling ducks, cormorants, babblers, peafowls, mynahs, red wattle lapwings, bulbuls, spoonbills, coucals, swallows, and turns all within half an hour of entering the park. The guide who likes to point it is not the Big 5, but the 5000 other animals that matter will point out even the smallest insect and many different types of dragon fly. The trip will take you to several sides of the old tank like lake system, where you can observe crocodiles from the safety of the rocks and other birds are spied with good pairs of binoculars such as stilts, moorhens and swamp hens, drongos, darters, koels, rollers, thick-knees, larks, owlets and even jungle crows. Each one will amaze you with their mosaics of colour, communication methods, hunting habits, choice of prey, colourful mating displays and odd mannerisms.
The topography of the reserve and conserved sanctuary is spread out flatly with rocky mountebanks and outcrops propping up every now and then in the mixed evergreen forest scrub jungle which covers another secret  the Magul Maha Viharaya across the road from the National Parks main entrance. It is here that King Kavantissa wedded his lady Queen Viharamaha Devi and the reconstructed dagoba and uposathagaraya can be seen in dusks surrender to the starlets of the night after an evening game drive.
A magical feel
This is also a great time to observe wild elephants outside of the park on the way to make an offering at the magnificent ruins of the Muhudu Maha Vihara, which are hidden inside the dunes and are one of only two historic Buddhist religious historic sites on this stunning eastern seashore, which is known as Sri Lankas surf capital. The temple complex is 3.5 km beyond Pottuvil, on the A4 Road where goats scamper, surfers surf at dawn and finally the houses are replaced by yellow sand dunes, which appear like giant rocks scattered along the coastline. These dunes today are seen as key to protecting the land from progressive sea encroachment and hold a great deal of Buddhist history and many other secrets just waiting to be dug up.
On arrival it is important to be respectful and cover your shoulders and leave the shoes at the entrance, and do take a copy of the small booklet at the entrance, which explains the site dates back to the reign of King Mahanaga, who built this temple in the 8th Century AD.
The King Kavantissa sacrificed his only daughter Viharamaha Devi to the sea to avert a catastrophe in the area and it is said that a boat was buried in the temple grounds. The kings daughter was later washed ashore near the East coast, where Muhudu Maha Vihara stands today. Other stories say she went to Kirinda and where ever she went the importance of these ruins remained.
The resident monks are happy to tell you about this historical site in the shade of the trees near where the pilgrims hang lucky wishes and make prayers daily. Some say this series of temple columns is near where the Queen bathed in sandalwood and this is where she also kept her royal jewellery. The monk feels this is just one of the reasons why so many pilgrims leave a special message hoping it will be granted as the place has a magical feel about it.
Its dagoba is the landmark when searching for the royal statues half buried amidst the ruins and sand it is currently being rebuilt and in front of it recent discoveries of more temple complex have been made since a stone was laid in 2013. The 28th King according to the Mahavamsa King Maha Naga built this Mudu temple for the memory of King Kavantissa and his Queen Viharamaha Devi.
To its west are the remains of a pillared structure where the torso of a Buddha statue was found and later restored by the Department of Archaeology. This sacred spot is lit at night and makes for a wonderful evening trip after an exciting safari, when its cooler underfoot from the burning sand of one of the islands hottest next destinations for the islands nature lovers and the truly spiritual.

Kurunegala poultry farmers left high and dry
Poultry farmers in the Kurunegala District complain that the price of eggs is decreasing rapidly these days and that they are being forced to close down their poultry farms due to the frequent losses.
They are unable to maintain the self-employment avenue of poultry farming profitably as the prices of veterinary drugs and relevant services, labour charges and high cost of poultry feed are increasing daily.
The wholesale price of an egg is now Rs. eight. Last week, it was Rs. 11. Consequently, a daily loss of Rs. 15,000 is incurred by small scale poultry farmers at present.
There are nearly 48,000 small scale poultry farmers in Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts. All are engaging in this industry as a source of self-employment.
However, the assistance and attention towards them by the Ministries of Agriculture and Rural Economic Development are insufficient, farmers said. If the government fails to address the grievances of these farmers soon, this industry will collapse, depriving the livelihoods of thousands of low income families in the NWP, said President of the Kurunegala District Poultry Farmers Co-Operative Society S. M. Premaratne.

Lanka Sathosa privatization canards shot down
Sri Lanka promptly shot down raging claims that the government owned Lanka Sathosa chain is to be sold to a diversified conglomerate in the country.
Though we usually do not bother about such social media propaganda, since a leading company is also mentioned, I am highlighting the truth here today said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen on May 24, in Colombo.
Minister Bathiudeen was addressing the awards night of Lanka Sathosa-Hemas joint promotion campaign called Sathosata Enna Car Eken Yanna, a marketing initiative partnered by Lanka Sathosa, the countrys largest state-owned FMCG retail chain operating under his Ministry.
Lanka Sathosa is the largest state-owned retail network. We are striving to develop it to be in par with other well-known supermarket chains in the country. Lanka Sathosa at one time was operating to serve the needs of the management and the top officials in charge of it but today, we are moving to make it to become competitive said Minister Bathiudeen.
After I took over Lanka Sathosa, we worked hard to correct these issues. The number of branches that was at 300 when I took over, now stands at 377. By December this year, we are increasing this to 500 sales outlets. I even removed the Lanka Sathosas personnel recruitment procedure from it and handed it over to the consultancy firm KPMG who recruited qualified personnel to run it.
We did not influence KPMGs recruitments. Our main aim is customer satisfaction, not profits, and then to expand the network and help consumers get all the essential items at the best price from these outlets, as per the directive of President Maithripala Sirisena. Recently, we have outsourced Lanka Sathosa distribution logistics to Hemas.
After a study by KPMG, it was identified that Lanka Sathosas distribution logistics, among other issues, was a bottleneck hampering the progress of the institution and KPMG recommended us to outsource it. We called open tenders and one of the bidders, Hemas, won it having fulfilled the criteria.
Thereafter I did not myself decide to award the tender to Hemas but I asked permission from the Cabinet of Ministers and received the go-ahead to outsource distribution logistics to Hemas. Almost all such Lanka Sathosa procurements were finally chosen by me, are only based on the Cabinet nod.
However, in the last few days someone was spreading rumours through social media saying Rishad sold Lanka Sathosa to Hemas' which is a totally false allegation. Though we usually do not bother about such social media propaganda, since a leading company is also mentioned, I am highlighting the truth here today.
As Lanka Sathosa expands to a 500 outlet strong network and another 8,000 franchise shops which will be enlisted in future, we have no choice but to sell all the essential items with the same price tag across all outlets in the country, and the importance of outsourcing Lanka Sathosa distribution logistics will become clearer to everyone. In fact, outsourcing distribution logistics has reduced Lanka Sathosas logistics burden.
Since the taking over of Lanka Sathosa by Minister Bathiudeen, he continuously insisted that Lanka Sathosa chain would not be privatised, but it would be developed using public private partnerships.
Lanka Sathosas annual sales turnover has now increased to Rs 30 billion. Almost 93% of its expenditure in 2016 was spent for capital development projects. Lanka Sathosa plans to open 8,000 franchise outlets with SME businesses in the coming year while expanding its present 377 branch network to 500 by end 2017.

Missing stars let French Open pretenders dream
PARIS THursday: Serena Williams bombshell pregnancy announcement last month triggered a sequence of events that has left this years womens draw at Roland Garros wide open and primed for a new champion.
The 23-time Grand Slam winner learned she was pregnant just two days before starting a successful assault on Januarys Australian Open and wont return before next year.
The French federation then refused to award Maria Sharapova a wild card for the tournament with the Russian on the comeback trail following a 15-month doping suspension.
While wild cards can be awarded to players returning from injury, this cannot be the case for those coming back from doping bans, FFT president Bernard Guidicelli said last week when announcing the decision.
With Li Na long since retired that means the winners of five of the past six French Opens -- Williams (2013, 2015), Sharapova (2012, 2014) and Li (2011) -- are absent from the field, while several pretenders to the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen are battling injury and loss of form.
Simona Halep, the 2014 runner-up, established herself as arguably the leading challenger by winning the Madrid Open before reaching the Rome final, but an ankle injury has cast doubt over her status.
Arriving early in Paris for treatment, Halep said in an Instagram post on Wednesday. The MRI scan shows a torn ligament from the fall in Roma. Im keeping my fingers crossed for RG and will do everything possible to be ready.
Doctors say its 50/50 at the moment but its made good improvement since Sunday... We are remaining very positive.
World number one Angelique Kerber has endured a miserable clay-court season, losing early in Stuttgart and crashing out in her Rome opener, while retiring from her last-16 clash in Madrid with a lower back injury.
Defending champion Garbine Muguruzas fortunes on the surface have proved almost as bleak.
Her only three wins came in Rome where she reached the semi-finals only for a neck injury to force her to quit against eventual champion Elina Svitolina, the fourth time the Spaniard has failed to complete a match in 2017.
Victoria Azarenka, the 2012 and 2013 Australian Open champion, hasnt played since last years Roland Garros after the birth of her son.
While the 27-year-old recently said she is ready to start competing, her return is scheduled for next months grass-court tournament in Mallorca as a tune-up ahead of Wimbledon. AFP

Modern democracy incomplete sans free media: Wijeyadasa
Modern democracy is incomplete in todays context without a free media, peoples participation and constant vigilance, said Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
The old definition for democracy says that it consists of the legislature, executive and the judiciary but it is incomplete without a free media, peoples participation and constant vigilance, he said.
The Minister was addressing the 14th International Electoral Affairs Symposium held in association with the Election Commission of Sri Lanka in Negombo yesterday.
Minister Rajapakshe emphasized that from the inception of modern democracy, one question that remains unresolved is how to identify the representative that one is going to elect.
He quoted Aristotle, If there is someone who thinks that he knows everything, but in fact he knows nothing; he has all the making of a politician. Minister Rajapakshe said that although democracy is imperfect it may through voting, people from all economic backgrounds and social strata can express their viewpoints and help members of the government who best reflect those points of view.
Elections are used to ensure popular support and legitimacy for those who make governmental decisions. Electoral systems shape the nature of parties and party systems and they affect the behavior of politicians and the strategies of voters. By voting one is making his voice heard and registering his opinion on how he thinks the government should operate, he said.
He further said that voting and democracy is very important in a nation because it provides people with an opportunity to voice their opinion and vote for what they believe in, it holds elected officials accountable for their behavior while in office, and it prevents a minority from dictating the policies of a minority.

Morgan ton sets up England win over South Africa
LEEDS, Wednesday: England captain Eoin Morgans fine century laid the platform for a 72-run win over South Africa in the day/night first one-day international at Headingley on Thursday.
Victory over the Proteas, the worlds number-one ranked ODI side, gave England a morale boost just a week before they host the Champions Trophy tournament featuring the worlds top eight 50-over sides and put them 1-0 up in this three-match series.
South Africa, set 340 to win, made steady progress while the experienced Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis shared a second-wicket stand of 112.
But they both fell in quick succession to leave the Proteas 149 for three.
South Africas innings never recovered and they were dismissed for 267 with five overs to spare.
Earlier, Morgans 107 -- his 10th ODI hundred for England -- was the cornerstone of the hosts 339 for six.
England had slumped to 198 for five but Morgans sixth-wicket stand of 117 with fellow left-hander Moeen Ali, who made a dashing 77 not out on his return, turned the tide.
Both batsmen struck five sixes apiece.
Ali, who ended Englands innings with a six off Chris Morris, was named man-of-the-match after also taking two wickets with his off-spin.
It was a pretty good day at the office for us, said Morgan.
The partnerships we built, gave us the best opportunity to get a par score and beyond.
South Africa skipper AB De Villiers accepted his side had been well beaten, telling Sky Sports: England played phenomenally well with the bat in hand. Morgs really dominated with the hundred.
We didnt bat well enough, we definitely should have come a lot closer. We lost Faf and Hash in close succession and that probably stopped us a little bit.
De Villiers, however, refused to read too much into this result ahead of the Champions Trophy.
We all have a bit of pressure on us and were all contenders to win that trophy, he said.
They played better tonight and hopefully well win the next one.
De Villiers chose to field first on a sunny day seeingly ideal for batting.
His decision was quickly rewarded when Jason Roy (one) was caught behind off left-armer Wayne Parnell in just the second over.
Both Alex Hales and England Test skipper Joe Root made runs on an easy-paced pitch before they each fell to Andile Phehlukwayo.
The 21-year-old seamer struck with his first ball Wednesday when Hales, on 61, flat-footedly chased a wide ball and got a thin edge to wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock.
Phehlukwayo then undid Root (37) with a bouncer the local hero mishooked to Amla.
But Morgan twice lofted Phehlukwayo for six.
Ben Stokes, back from impressing in the Indian Premier League, holed out for 30 and fellow IPL star Jos Buttler, replacing in-form Yorkshireman Jonny Bairstow, glanced to short fine leg on seven.
But Morgan, who struggled for game time in this seasons IPL, went to his hundred in grand fashion when he hooked fast bowler Kagiso Rabada over long leg for six.
He holed out off Morris soon afterwards to end a 93-ball innings but Ali kept going as England plundered 102 runs in the last 10 overs.
England then had an early breakthrough when dangerman de Kock fell for just five after skying Chris Woakes to opposing keeper Buttler.
The match ended when Rabada was caught behind off Woakes, who took four for 38.
Before play, teams and officials were joined by spectators in observing a minutes silence in memory of the victims of Mondays terror attack in nearby Manchester that killed 22 people and injured dozens more.
The series continues at Southampton on Saturday and concludes with next Mondays match at Lords.

JVP vehemently opposes Rideemaliyadda sugar factory
JVP Leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday in Parliament, vehemently opposed the proposal to grant 65,000 acres in Rideemaliyadda to a foreign company to start a sugar factory.
Moving an Adjournment Motion in the House, the MP urged the Government not to proceed with the proposed Uva-Wellassa Sugar Industry project also highlighting its detrimental impact on the environment, archaeological heritage and the lives of the people of the area.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena has presented a Cabinet Paper on this project on.
Dissanayake pointed out the initial proposal in this regard was made in 2006 and the former Government had obtained environmental approval to it by force. The proposed strip of land is located in between Nilgala and Maduruoya reserves.
About seven archaeological sites are located in that area.
The proposed project damages the entire eco-system and aggravates the human-elephant conflict.
We demand a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) covering the whole area of this project, he said. He said the project was aimed at producing 80,000 metric tonnes of sugar, adding that it requires 2.8 million litres of water on the first day of its operation. How are you going to get this water Is it from Maduru Oya This is a very large factory.
Even though we join Hingurana, Kanthale, Sevanagala and Pelawatte sugar factories together, the extent of land would be less than 40,000 acres, but this factory has an extent of 65,000 acres, he said.
The MP said the Government was going to distribute 5 acres each for 7,500 farmers with the condition of cultivating only sugar cane, adding that this would in turn make them labourers of the factory.
He called on the Government to stop this project and follow an environmental friendly development approach when utilizing those lands.
Opposition envious of development taking place in Badulla district :Harin
An investment of US$ 152 million had never been made in the history of the Badulla district, said Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando in Parliament yesterday.
He also said that the Opposition members envious of the massive development taking place in the district.
He added that not only the sugar factory, but a number of other factories and renewable energy plants would be set up in Rideemaliyadda.
The Minister made this observation joining the Adjournment Motion moved by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake, demanding to stop construction of the Sugar factory in Rideemaliyadda.
"Rideemaliyadda is the second poorest Divisional Secretariat in the country," the Minister said.
"The youth in Rideemaliyadda go to Colombo to work as labourers in construction sites and as security guards.
Those people do not stand against these projects, but those of the Opposition who are envy of the government's programmes to serve the people."
Govt has released 5,000 acres of land to people in N/E: Kiriella
The Unity Government has released 5,000 acre of land in the Northern and Eastern Provinces to the people, said Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament yesterday.
He added that everything was ready to release another extent of another 3,000 acres to the people in the N/E.
He made these observations yesterday in response to a special statement made by EPDP Leader Douglas Devananda under Standing Order 23(2), requesting the government to grant deeds of 800 acres in Trincomalee to 2,200 families. Minister Kiriella said MP Devananda should acknowledge that the government had granted 5,000 acres to the people there.
"Do you acknowledge it" Minister Kiriella queried from MP Devananda. "Yes I accept it," said MP Devananda. "But this is another issue." "
No information concerning gold belonging to Tamil people in refugee camps: Minister Karunathilake
The Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry yesterday, informed Parliament that it did not not possess any information on the gold belonging to Tamil people who were in refugee camps.
The Ministry made the above observation in response to a question by UPFA MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara. MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena asked the question as MP Nanayakkara was absent and the Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake tabled the answer on behalf of subject Minister D M Swaminathan.
MP Nanayakkara has asked whether a large quantity of gold belonging to the Tamil people who were living in Refugee camps after the war, was deposited anywhere in a trust and whether these deposits were enumerated, whether there were complaints that their gold had not been returned to them so far and the steps taken by the government to settle these claims. The Ministry in its reply said it does not have any such information.
UNP and UPFA had no discussions to set up unity rule at LG elections: Minister Amaraweera
The objective of the UPFA is to set up a government of its own in 2020, said UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera in Parliament yesterday.
He said that several newspapers had carried a news report that the UPFA was attempting to establish a unity rule at Local Government Institutions as well which is not true. Minister Amaraweera made this observation speaking during the Adjournment Motion.
He said the people do not need to be misled.
"The UPFA and the UNP had not discussed to set up unity rule at local institutions level or at the next election in 2020," Minister Amaraweera said.
The Minister further said that the country had imported sugar to the value of US$ 343 million last year too. Sri Lanka is one of the countries which has a high sugar consumption. He said that due to this reason, the country had to produce the sugar it needed.
"Although the Opposition says 65,000 acres of land had been given, it is incorrect," the Minister said.
"Only 40,000 acres would be given. The required reports have been already taken to assure the protection of the environment."
He also said that there were two sugar factories in the country and there was a need of another. He added that the Sevanagala and Pelwatta towns were developed with the setting up of the factories. He added that the jobs created with the setting up of this factory would come to the Uva Province.

Pogba sends grieving Man Utd to emotional Europa triumph
STOCKHOLM THursday: Paul Pogba dedicated victory to the victims of this weeks Manchester terror attack after propelling Manchester United towards a 2-0 victory over Ajax in Wednesdays Europa League final.
A night that began with a moment of silence, then applause, in memory of the 22 people who died at Manchester Arena on Monday ended with United completing their trophy collection through goals from Pogba and Henrikh Mkhitaryan.
We played for the people who died, Pogba told BT Sport.
These things are terrible all over the world, in London and in Paris. We went out focused to win and we won for Manchester and the country. Reminders of the attack were everywhere at Stockholms Friends Arena, from Uniteds black armbands to the chants of Manchester! from their fans, while Pogba, too, was grieving, following the recent death of his father.
United manager Jose Mourinho told reporters: If we could, we would obviously change the peoples lives for this cup, immediately.
We wouldnt think twice. Does this cup make the city of Manchester a little bit happier Maybe. But we just came to do our job. Victory enabled Mourinho, who said prior to the game that he and his players were struggling not to think about the tragedy, to bring his maiden Old Trafford season to a successful conclusion.
He had already guided United to glory in the League Cup and despite a sixth-place finish in the Premier League, success in the Europa League means his side will return to the Champions League next season.
United became only the fifth club -- after Juventus, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Chelsea -- to have won the Champions League, the Europa League and the now defunct European Cup Winners Cup.
Mourinho, a UEFA Cup winner with Porto in 2003 and two-time European champion, has now won all four of the major European finals he has contested. Ajax were appearing in their first continental showpiece match since the 1996 Champions League decider and fielded a team with an average age of 22 years and 282 days -- the youngest to have ever started a major European final.
