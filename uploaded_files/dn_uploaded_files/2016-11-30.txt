Rhythmic Bharata Natyam
Tamil art and culture was a very important part of my upbringing, originating in Nallur and nurtured by the Suntheralingam part of my family- Linga Satchithananda, Vatha Chelvadurai, Mani Rajarayan, S Satyalingam and of course my main guru Neela Balendra. It is kept alive in me to day by my cousins Anjalen, one of Sri Lankas leading architects who insists on dragging to me to every concert, exhibition and performance that he feels he must see and my cousin Anandavalli who has made Bharata natyam blossom in Australia.
Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam who was my mentor and N. Ram of the Hindu also gave me access to books on Tamil art and culture that widened my horizons. After Dr. Tiruchelvams death, in his memory, we invited some of the best artists to perform on his birth anniversary during the war years to remind us that life is also about creativity and beauty. Though my proficiency in the Tamil language is limited due to years of being overseas, Tamil art and culture is very much a part of my identity- though I will agree not the only part.
Bharata Natyam is the worlds oldest dance form dating back to 300 BC. Of all the dance forms available to us it is also perhaps the most expressive and most subtle with countless mudras and eye expressions. Its rhythmic qualities are equal to any of the dances of other countries with its difficult and intricate foot movements that keep audiences enthralled. This combination of facial expression and rhythm make it unique and therefore its legacy has drawn a great deal of attention from scholars all over the world.
When we look back we must acknowledge and appreciate that Bharata Natyam has its own particular history. Though it has its origins in 300BC, by the sixteenth century it became the exclusive dance form of temple courtesans who during that time, like the Nautch Kathak dancers of the North of India, became the center of music and dance. In 1892 British missionaries and British Colonial Officers, aided by socially conservative Hindus started the anti-dance movement. In 1910, Bharata Natyam, this most beautiful of dance forms was banned in the Madras Presidency.
Therefore one part of the Indian nationalist movement, especially in the South, was to revive Bharata Natyam. Rukmini Arundale, a Brahmin broke all social conventions of her time and later went onto found the dance school of Kalakshetra. The famous dancer Balasaraswathi who was herself one of the last devadasis assisted her. These two kept the dance form alive, thereby taking it out of the temples and into the mainstream. In the North this was done by Mirnalini Sarabhai, also a Brahmin, who formed Darpana. It was not easy for them. They were greeted with hostility by sociallyconservative Hindus, often booed and even stoned.
With time, not only has this Bharata Natyam gained acceptance, most middle class Tamil girls (such as myself) were expected to learn and excel in the dance form. It became an important item in a modern Tamil girls CV. So when we have these events and performances, we must not forget pioneers like Rukmini Arundale, Mirnalini Sarabhai and Balasaraswati who fought against British colonialism and ultra conservative social values that prevented men and women from artistically expressing themselves. It is they who preserved and protected this wonderful dance form.
Today, especially in India Bharata Natyam is not only alive it is pushing all the boundaries. The new Bharata Natyam superstars really leave you spellbound with their sense of discipline and perfection. They also meet dancers from other traditions on a complete basis of equality. Some argue that their impeccable technical perfection has taken away from the soul of the dance embodied by dancers like Balasaraswati and this is a debate that continues among connoisseurs. Yet Bhara Natyam in India is alive thriving and full of passion. On Thursday I leave for Chennai to see a performance by Anandavallis dance troupe- there will be traditional Bharata Natyam but also Bharata Natyam set to Japanese Taiko drumming.We are hoping that sometime in the futue Anadavalli will come to Sri Lanka and do a collaborative performance with another exceptional dance phenomenon- the Chitrasena Dance Troupe.
Sri Lanka has gone through a terrible civil war where our own Tamil leaders downplayed Tamil Art and Culture. Even today this is not a main item on their agenda. People like Vasugi tried to keep it alive despite all odds. We owe them a great debt of gratitude. Thank You Vasugi. . I saw the sad faces of Bharata Natyam dances during the war but look at what we have seen today- it has been quite magnificent. Now that peace has finally come let us double our efforts to revive Tamil expressive arts and work towards greater creativity and perfection.

Plane crash kills dream of football team that defied odds
SAO PAULO, Brazil, Tuesday  Traveling on the doomed airliner that crashed in Colombia overnight were the players and staff of a Brazilian football club about to complete a fairytale journey from unknowns to would-be South American champions.
The LAMIA charter plane went down near Medellin late Monday with 81 people aboard and so far only six are reported to have survived. At least two were said by officials to be football players.
For the Chapecoense Real team the disaster means the cruel end of a story that had been meant to climax with an unexpected chance for glory on Wednesday against Colombias Atletico Nacional in the first leg of the Copa Sudamericana final.
The pain is terrible. Just as we had made it, I will not say to the top, but to have national prominence, a tragedy like this happens. It is very difficult, a very great tragedy, club
vice-president Ivan Tozzo told SporTV. Only a few years ago Chapecoense was just another a gritty outfit in the Brazilian lower leagues, where players, unable to afford cars, took the bus to training. The stadium in Chapeco, a city of 200,000 people in the southern Santa Catarina state, didnt have a gym. The steep climb from minnow to contender started in 2009 when Chapecoense entered the fourth division. Back then, the teams top goalscorer Bruno Rangel told Brazilian newspaper Lance, even the clubs bus was was very old. But a lot has changed in the club since I arrived, he said. There are still prejudices against the club but more because were from the (countrys) interior. Thats diminishing, its true. Every day were more respected.
By 2014 the club had fought its way into the lower half of the elite table, but the side wanted more. Even at this point Chapecoense was almost ignored by its own public, with only about 7,000 people turning up to home games, according to Globoesporte website. Chapecoense entered the running for the Copa Sudamericana for the first time in 2015 and didnt disappoint.
In the clubs first ever international tournament, the one-time unknowns didnt go all the way, but they performed bravely, even defeating Argentinas famed River Plate club.
This year, things seemed to be going wrong. The coach credited with Chapecoenses miraculous rise, Guto Ferreira, walked out and his replacement Caio Junior lost his first game against the lowly Cuiaba.
But the little team that could roared back, taking down Argentinas Independiente and Junior de Barranquilla. They were going to the final to meet the reigning Copa Libertadores champions Atletico Nacional and no one would write them off anymore.
On the way to Colombia, the team stopped off in Sao Paulo to play the penultimate game of Brazils domestic league. Here they lost against Palmeiras, the team which ended the season as Brazilian champion. But there was a sense that the players had their minds on the bigger challenge awaiting them against Atletico. I see this is a group of winners. Its as if God has put us precisely here today to taste this and to appreciate even more the challenge on Wednesday, the coach said after the Sao Paulo game.
Now their dreams have met a devastating end and on Wednesday at what would have been an intriguing first leg of the Copa Sudamericana final therell be only silence.
Back in Chapeco, the stadium was opened up to greet grieving families and fans.
Were all here at the stadium to help the people connected, said Tozzo. It hasnt really sunk in yet. We have to trust in God. Out team must carry on, he said. AFP

Sex abuse scandal biggest crisis ever for FA Chairman
LONDON Tuesday: The sex abuse scandal rocking English football is the greatest crisis current Football Association chairman Greg Clarke can recall, he told Sky News on Tuesday.
Clarke was referring to the serial child molester Barry Bennell, who has been accused by at least 20 footballers of abusing them when he worked for Crewe Alexandra, Manchester City and Stoke City across three decades beginning in the 1970s, and is subject to five separate police investigations.
The FA has also launched its own internal reviewappointing leading lawyer Kate Gallafent, an expert in child protection, to head it up. The FA said the review would find out what information the FA was aware of at the relevant times around the issues that have been raised in the press, what clubs were aware of, and what action was or should have been taken.
