SL needs to implement  27 conventions for GSP+

Sri Lanka needs to ensure that there is no serious failure on its part to implement the 27 international conventions at the desired level to be qualified for the GSP plus concession, Commerce Director General Sonali Wijeratne said.
Looking at the regulations which are applicable to the European Parliament and Council, the facts of the case and the experience of others countries that have also thought of applying under various conditions, Sri Lanka has an excellent case.
According to Wijeratne, Sri Lanka has to look at a compendium of other issues as to how long Sri Lanka can actually keep GSP plus concession going on by ensuring that there is no serious failure on the part of Sri Lanka to implement the conventions at the desired level. The country has to comply with 27 international conventions, which cut across a gamut of human rights, labour, environmental, governance issues,Wijeratne said adding that there should not be any reservations in any of those conventions.
All these have to be shown up in order to be qualified for the GSP preference. Wijeratne further added that the European commission through its report on the assessment of application for the GSP plus by Sri Lanka, released in January 2017 has unequivocally concluded that there is no serious failure to effectively implement any of the conventions.

Trafficker Brit woman had helped two Sri Lankans fly to UK with false passports
A British woman, arrested with three other UK nationals in a case of alleged human trafficking, had helped two Sri Lankans fly to the UK with fake passports in January.
Police said that Julie Ann Warner (36), a tourist guide, had confessed that she became a carrier after meeting a Sri Lankan agent, Logorajan, six months ago.
Warner and three other Britishers were arrested at Sahar airport on March 15 for allegedly helping four Lankans migrate to the UK, using forged passports.
Senior inspector of Sahar Police station, BT Mukhedkar, said that the UK nationals were "not cooperating" in the probe.
The police said that agents wanted in the case had demanded Rs17 lakhs each from the Lankans to help them reach the UK with fake passports which identified them as the four arrested UK nationals.
The Lankans, on reaching the UK, planned to surrender before the authorities and claim that they had flown there due to a threat to their lives from Lankan Tigers and hoped "to get political asylum there".
Public prosecutor Neeta Masarkar said that the fake Indian passports had fake immigration stamps. Counsel for the British nationals, Prabhakar Tripathi, said that his clients were victims as the agents had duped them.

We have no antivenom for deadly snake bites
Sri Lanka does not produce antivenom so far in respect of three out of seven deadly serpents found in Sri Lanka, Senior Prof. Jayantha Rajapaksa of the Veterinary Faculty of the Peradeniya University said.
Prof. Jayantha Rajapaksa
Cobra, Common Krait (Karawala), Sri Lanka Krait (Mudu Karawala), Russell Viper (Tith Polaga), Saw Scale Viper (Weli Polaga), Hump Nose Viper (Polon Theissa), and Green Pit Viper (Pala Polaga) are the seven deadly snakes found in Sri Lanka.
Of them, antivenom was produced in respect of the Hump Nose Viper, Sri Lanka Krait and the Green Pit Viper, he said. Prof. Rajapaksa said antivenom needed to treat snake bite victims is imported from India and that country does not produce antivenom in respect of the three snakes. India produced antivenom in respect of the other four species found there country but it does not suit in respect of some species found in Sri Lanka. This is because the strength of snake venom varied from region to region and country to country.
Therefore, attention had been drawn towards producing antivenom typical to serpent species found in the country. A programme was launched to catch deadly serpent species from various parts of the country and extract their venom to produce antivenom suitable for the three serpents.
Since the antivenom production in Sri Lanka is extremely costly, the venom extracted from Sri Lanka's serpent species would be dried and sent to India to get the antivenom produced there at cheaper rates for hospitals in Sri Lanka.
Prof. Rajapaksa said the Science and Technology Ministry had extended its co-operation for this programme conducted with the approval of the Department of Wildlife.

Abe, Merkel call for open markets
GERMANY: German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japans Prime Minister Shinzo Abe issued a staunch joint defence of free trade Sunday, as the United States pushes towards greater protectionism.
We want free and open markets, Merkel said in a speech in Hanover, a day before the worlds biggest computer trade fair, CeBIT, kicks off in the central German city.
The event is partnered with Japan this year.
In these times of inter-connectedness, we want to link together our societies and work together in an equitable way. Thats what free trade is about, she said.
She made no direct reference to US President Donald Trump, elected on a protectionist America First platform promising to slash trade deficits, but noted that the European Union and Japan are negotiating a free trade deal that may be reached this year.
At a time when we are arguing a lot over free trade, open borders and democratic values, its a good sign that Japan and Germany are not arguing over trade, she said.
Abe, who is in Hanover as part of a European tour, said that Japan wants to be the champion upholding open systems alongside Germany.
He said it was through connectedness that economies would grow, and called for a swift conclusion to the EU-Japan trade deal.
But he added: We must not create conditions by which wealth becomes concentrated among only some people.
At a fraught G20 meeting in the German spa town of Baden-Baden on Saturday, the US challenged long-standing global principles surrounding free trade, refusing to renew past anti-protectionist pledges and threatening to reopen negotiations on World Trade Organization deals.
Since taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from a trans-Pacific free trade pact and attacked export giants China and Germany over their massive trade surpluses. - AFP

AIADMK call for India to oppose UNHRC extension on Sri Lanka

India must oppose a resolution in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) moved by the US, the UK and some other countries on giving two more years until 2019 for Sri Lanka to submit its report on the killing of Tamils, the AIADMK said in Indian Parliament yesterday.
AIADMK leader V Maitreyan raised the matter in Rajya Sabha during Zero Hour and urged the Centre to take the initiative to see that an independent international investigation is ordered.
Requesting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring justice to Eelam Tamils, Maitryean said: I urge the Government of India to oppose this Resolution in the UNHRC in the voting to be held on 22nd March.
He said that eight years have elapsed since the systematic genocide of Eelam Tamils in Lanka in 2009, in which over 150,000 Tamils were killed. So far, no reliable investigation has been undertaken and not a single guilty has been punished, he said.
He said a resolution was adopted in the UNHRC sponsored by the US and Sri Lanka in 2015 that called for independent investigation of the war crimes in Sri Lanka with the participation of international judges and lawyers and jurists.

Auction of Malwana land allegedly owned by Basil suspended
Pugoda Magistrate and Additional District Judge Nilupuli Lankapura yesterday suspended the auction of the 16-acre Malwana land and house said to be owned by former Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa and Thirukumar Nadesan.
The magistrate made this order after the court was informed that the Cabinet of Ministers has decided to use the land for the welfare of the people. The FCID informed the court the decision of the Attorney General to use the land bordering the Kelani river for the welfare of the people.
Considering the submissions by the FCID, the magistrate reserved the judgement for March 23.
The minimum bid was set at Rs.208 million on the Valuation Department assessment. A case was filed by the FCID under the Money Laundering Act following a complaint that former Minister Basil Rajapaksa had bought the 16-acre land at Mapitigama for Rs. 64 million and built a luxury house on it at a cost of Rs. 125 million.
It was alleged the land and the house belonged to Rajapaksa, and that it was bought using public funds.
However, lawyers for the former Economic Development Minister told Court that the land did not belong to their client.

## Title: Avoid hysteria for UNHRC

Avoid hysteria for UNHRC
The ongoing sessions of the UN Human Rights Council, has seen heightened public interest and escalating rhetoric with regard to both the state reforms and reconciliation processes. The Joint Opposition (JO), basically the political grouping supporting defeated President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been ratcheting up its anti-reform and anti-reconciliation rhetoric in to overdrive. The political heat generated though creates more confusion rather than throwing light on the relevant facts, which should be considered with due seriousness and careful consideration.
The foreign (and indeed domestic) policy approach of the National Unity Government formed in 2015, is at considerable variance with that followed by its predecessor. Indeed, it should be so, since the Rajapaksa approach, post the end of the war, failed to maintain our international friends, all of whom had supported Sri Lankas battle against the LTTE, isolated Sri Lanka, damaged our relations with trading partners and resulted in a growing self-imposed isolation from the world. Rather than building bridges and engaging the world, which is what is required for a strategically placed, island nation.
Co-sponsoring the resolution in Geneva, was and is the right thing to do, as it clearly states to the world, that Sri Lanka as a sovereign state, takes responsibility for its own actions and is ready to be accountable for compliance with its international obligations, as a free and equal member of the international community of nations.
Our robust engagement with the world, enhances and promote rather than detracts from our national interest. Our national interests, whether security, economic or socio-cultural are not served by becoming a pariah state.
Much ado about foreign judges
The Joint Opposition of the defeated Rajapaksa regime, makes much ado and seeks to create some hysteria about the sections of the resolution which talk of foreign participation in accountability processes including judges, prosecutors etc. However, it must be noted that it was the very act of the Rajapaksa regime in summarily sacking former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake and imposing an interloper at the apex of Sri Lankas judiciary, which severely eroded international and indeed domestic confidence in Sri Lankas judiciary, the Bar Association leading the opposition to the impugned removal of Chief Justice Bandaranayake.
The restoration of the independence of the judiciary, best symbolized by the restoration of Chief Justice Bandaranayake after the 2015 Presidential election, was the first step in restoring confidence in Sri Lankas judiciary.
Firstly, it was the Rajapaksa administration which introduced foreign jurists into Sri Lankas transitional justice mechanisms, when President Rajapaksas Special Presidential Commission on Grave Human Rights Abuses also comprised of the International Group of Eminent Persons (IGEP) led by former Indian Chief Justice Bhagwatti and aided by foreign legal experts in prosecutions and forensics. Moreover, the subsequent Rajapaksa administration creation of the Paranagama Commission was also assisted by a foreign judge and lawyers.
Moreover, all Sri Lankans are no doubt proud that eminent Sri Lankan judges serve on both foreign national judiciaries and international legal tribunals, late Justice Weeramantry being the best-known example. But other Sri Lankan judges have also served in Fiji, Botswana and several other countries.
Secondly, the UNHRC Resolution categorically states that the accountability process and the institutions or mechanisms created would be a domestic (Sri Lankan) process. Clearly a Sri Lankan process, would be Sri Lankan led and managed with such expertise, assistance and support as required to ensure, a credible process, whose outcome everybody can trust.
Focus on reconciliation
The real problem with the current tone, tenor and content of the political debate, especially as defined by the Joint Opposition (JO) is that it completely ignores the reality and the national need for what President Sirisena has frequently defined as Sanhindiyawa or reconciliation, which is dealing with the effects and the causes of our near three decades of civil conflict. Which Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, so aptly refers to as addressing the failures of dealing with our diversity, which has cost our nation dearly. We owe it to our future generations of Sri Lankans that we do not bequeath them a nation, which is ethnically polarized, with simmering communal tensions and a sub optimal economy, where the national past time of the young and not so young, including mothers, is to leave the country.
Sri Lanka like any other country requires reform and the National Unity Administration of President Sirisena and Prime Minster Wickramasinghe was elected on a platform of reform, economic development and reconciliation.
The quick, easy wins in that process was achieved during the one hundred (100) day programme in 2015. Much of the ground work for the harder more substantial measures on reforms, economic development and reconciliation was done last year in 2016 and the current year should be the one which sees some of the fruition of those efforts. To oppose such reforms due to focusing on mid-term Local Government and Provincial elections is extremely short sighted and definitely not in the national interest.
A political opposition in a democratic society does have a crucial role to play as a watch dog and a constructive critic, holding a government accountable. However, the current political rhetoric and the consequent social tensions generated are more polarizing and divisive than constructive. A national reform process, must indeed be inclusive and this includes not only the majority monoethnic JO but also accommodate and include the ethnic minority and other smaller parties, to ensure that the reformed institutions of the Sri Lankan state, accommodates the full diversity of our nations multi ethnic and multi religious society.

In this day and age the availability of information is no longer confined to that which is physical. The concept of a library has been changing for some time now. Now one does not need to travel physically to a destination. One does not need to stroll through the aisle and search for books. One needs to only connect to the World Wide Web and the world of information opens up to you immediately. It is an emancipation of the mind conceived by the mind and a freedom of opinion. It is an endless digital library, expanding forever while humans live.
For a long time now individuals have been blogging about opinions and facts that can be accessed by visitors of the World Wide Web. This futuristic cyber tool is now becoming a dominant source of information.
Daily News learns that the Nelum Yaya Foundation is interested in giving recognition to individual bloggers for their well- earned innovative opinions and contents.
So for the third consecutive year on March 25, The Nelum Yaya Blog Awards Festival 2016 will be held.
Nelum Yaya Blog Awards Festival has been created to recognize true viral style and creative excellence across a variety of 21 main awards including 
q Best Blog Awards (Three awards  first, second and third places for Sinhala/Tamil/ English)
q Blogs that have been operating under various topics  Education, History, Topical Discussion, short stories, political, translation, comedy, fiction, scientific fiction, science and technology, music, travel and photography, poetry and literature reviews.
The Nelum Yaya Blog Awards Festival is organized to promote and highlight the importance of blogging. The first Nelum Yaya Blog Awards Festival was launched in 2014.
When Nelum Yaya Foundation started the Blog Festival, there were no sponsors and we had to pay out of our own pockets. Now there are a few sponsors for the Blog Awards. Nelum Yaya Foundation is under Lanka News Web. It began as a charitable entity under Lanka News Web, receiving no help from any external source.
Nelum Yaya Foundation continue to conduct charitable activities. The Blog Festival is not for the sake of giving awards, it is to help the poor, said Lanka News Web, Kumudini Wijayawardhana.
Seasoned and experienced political blogger Ajith Parakum Jayasinghe a previous award winner, said that blogging has nothing to do with profit and is done not for profit. It is a social entity.
Through the World Wide Web one has the opportunity to share ones thoughts and opinions. This is the right of an individual. During the last decade in Sri Lanka blogging has been used to great effect. In that decade blogging has evolved. Information technology has changed at a rapid rate. And blogging has taken on a wider meaning. Twitter is one good example and very popular elsewhere in the world.
There are also so many bloggers that cannot be involved in this festival. Also doing a festival like this is not easy task. I come from a village background. I am a professional blogger. I feel that we have to keep up with the changing world and update ourselves. Anyone can start up a blog, it is simple.
I must say that, there are challenges that come with being a professional blogger or someone who does it out of social responsibility. Because it takes effort and there are disappointments.
So we have to encourage bloggers, said Jayasinghe Jayasinghe stressed the need for recognition in this field and that such festivals are important.
For the Nelum Yaya Blog Awards Festival 2016, blog posts that have been published during the period of January 1 to December 31, 2016, will be considered, along with the blogs and blog posts which have been shortlisted by the Sri Lanka Bloggers Association.
The shortlisted blogs and blog posts will be judged by an independent panel of judges and finalize the winners of the year under above mentioned categories.
The awards festival will be held on March 25, at Waters Edge, Baththaramulla from 3 pm to 7 pm.

The interest in Sri Lanka was evident from the lively interaction the participants had with the Sri Lankan delegation at the Question and Answer (Q&A) session.
Making the keynote address at the event, National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Niroshan Perera pledged governments continued commitment to facilitating investments and stimulating the establishment of transparent and well governed institutions.
SEC Director General Vajira Wijegunewardane said they are resolute and unwavering in insistence on better, more facilitative regulations across the board, and are committed to formulating new policies which will lay a solid foundation for the market, enabling it to grow to potential and to enter new frontiers: while concurrently working on a wide complement of developmental initiatives.
Colombo Stock Exchange, Chairman Vajira Kulatilaka spoke about the opportunities in the capital market highlighting the comparatively low PEs and the diversification opportunity the Colombo Stock market offers. He urged the participants to consider the different debt and equity options on offer including the entry to Colombo through professionally managed funds.
The CSE chairman alluded to the rise in corporate earnings in the last quarter making a case for investors to make use of the current opportunity in the market and the potential for future growth.
Central Banks Economic Research Director Dr. Yuthika Indraratne said the reforms undertaken and development strategies adopted will enable Sri Lanka to achieve the envisaged high growth trajectory.
She also expressed positive sentiments on several economic indicators, including Real GDP growth, which is expected to improve in 2017 and the overall budget balance,which is also expected to improve this year.
Fitch Ratings Lanka MD and Country Head Maninda Wickramasinghe said the development projects presently taking place in the country present a number of opportunities for foreign investors, especially in the context that such projects demand long term financing.

CIMA Sri Lanka holds first convocation for 2017
CIMA Sri Lankas first Convocation for the year celebrated the success of 301 exam completed students, 379 Associate members, 11 Fellow members and 8 prize winners.
Andrew Harding (Chief Executive  Management Accounting) of the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants (the Association) was the chief guest. This is the first Convocation held in Sri Lanka following the creation of the Association earlier in the year.
In January 2017, CIMA and their joint venture partner, the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA), combined their strengths to form the Association, which aims to be the most influential body of professional accountants in the world. The Association represents 650,000 members and students in public and management accounting and advocates for the public interest and business sustainability on current and emerging issues.
In his address to the audience, Andrew elaborated on the significance of the Association further: Our Association will enhance the recognition of your management accounting qualification, your career prospects and your employability. The quality of Sri Lankan CIMA members, students and tuition provision was highly praised by Andrew who stated that he continues to be impressed by the achievements of local CGMAs.
He added: Here in Sri Lanka the CIMA community is a strong one, with around 4,000 members holding the Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA) designation.
As CGMAs, they occupy strategic positions in businesses and organisations across different sectors. The community is strong because employers recognise the value that our qualification brings.
Andrews parting message at the Convocation was the importance of management accountants staying relevant in a world facing unprecedented socio-economic and technological changes. Management accountants are crucial at a time such as this to make better business decisions.
The Global Management Accounting Principles of relevance, value, trust and influence were introduced by CIMA and AICPA for quality decision making, to respond appropriately to risks faced by organisations and to create value.

Whats next for buses
The bus rapid transport system (BRTS) - similar to what was experimented in the Rajagiriya area last week- is reported to have been initiated in 1974 by Jaime Lerner who was an architect and the Mayor of Curitiba in Latin America. A comprehensive article written on the subject by Nicholas Hollman appears in the Development and Cooperation magazine of November-December 2016 (www.dandc.eu).
After its initiation it has spread to all parts of the world as the BRT system is expected to be fast, convenient and reliable. To quote from the article: The big advantage of the BRT systems is that they are considerably cheaper to set up than metropolitan railways, which need a track system to be laid out, or underground railways, which require expensive tunnels to be dug. Per kilometer, a BRT route generally costs no more than 10% of what an underground railway route would cost, and 30 to 60% of what a tram route would cost. BRT is particularly interesting for poorer regions provided the road space is available.
One week is too short a period to assess the success of a BRT system. It depends on many factors like feeder bus services, cooperation of the bus crews, dedicated bus lanes, support from commuters and bus companies.
The buses that ply on the dedicated lanes should keep on moving, stopping at bus halts only for not more than two minutes. (Some of the worst offenders are 168, 150, 173 and 276 if the Transport Ministry is keen to take action).
They should not stagnate along the route especially during the rush hour to overload the buses to earn more revenue, thus harassing the passengers. They should be satisfied with moderate profits.
Efficient supervision is an absolute must if the BRT system is to give the expected benefits to the commuters. The BRT system is meant to provide convenience and fast transit to the less affluent classes of our society who cannot afford their own vehicles. Once the services become efficient and effective the vehicle owners will also use those services.

Dion shares career advice from late husband
Celine Dion shared the best piece of advice she was given by her late husband Rene Angelil with hopefuls on U.S. TV talent show The Voice.
The 48-year-old singers spouse and manager of three decades Rene died in January, 2016, after losing his battle with cancer. Despite Rene no longer being with her, Celine still lives by the words of advice he shared with her over the years, and decided to impart this knowledge to singers on The Voice as they prepared for the series Battle Rounds.
In a preview for the upcoming episode, shown after Wednesday nights (15Mar17) programme, Celine, who is a mentor for Gwen Stefanis team, is seen telling the wannabe stars: My husband is always with me. He said, You cannot be good all the time. You have to be good when its time.
John Legend, Luke Bryan and DJ Khaled will also act as mentors alongside Celine, for the other judges teams. Celine explained she has always been overwhelmed by the level of talent on the programme, which is what pushed her to sign on for the role.
What I like about The Voice is I get to be stunned by amazing talents, she said. This is the new generation.
Having her team learning from Celine was a unique experience for No Doubt star Gwen as well, with the 47-year-old admitting she also considers the My Heart Will Go On singer a musical idol.
She is so unique. Every song she puts out is a world song, she speaks to the world and thats a whole other level (than), Oh I made it as a pop star in America, Gwen said during an interview on Late Night With Seth Meyers recently. Shes (been) massive since she was 13 years old, so having her on the show was incredible.

Emerging scenarios  for the Colombo bourse
The Colombo stock exchange gathered momentum in its forward march in the last three decades of the 20th century.The exchange was housed at the Mckinnon & Mackenzie building near the Colombo port and the famous Grand Oriental Hotel known earlier as Taprobane Hotel.
Prior to the dawn of the last decade of the 20th century,the activity at the Colombo bourse was dominated by a number of high net worth individuals, a few corporate entities and a relatively lower number of retailers.
The brokers had to shout at full throat to bid for the required quantities for their clients. Further, the issue of share certificates took a much more than expected times.
As a result, the investors were unable to sell their shares during market rally times in the absence of share certificates. Those days the share certificates had to be lodged with the brokers prior to the sale by an investor. Another major obstacle was that the investor was able to know the quantities purchased by their brokers on the following day only as they were not in a position to stay at the bourse itself and execute the purchase through their brokers.
Certain parties fraudulently printed share certificates and sold those shares in the market to unsuspecting purchasers. This happened in the case of high value shares. The number of stockbrokers were limited at that time and there was share price manipulations to a great extent. The turnover levels were also much lower.
With the shifting of the Colombo stock exchange to its present location at the world trade centre in the mid nineties, we witnessed a rapid growth of the market with the increase in numbers of retailers, foreign investors, local instituitional funds and others who saw opportunities and the potential of the Colombo bourse.
However, the bourse had to meet the full impact of two major bomb explosions in the vicinity of their premises, namely the Galadari Hotel car park and the major one at the central bank premises. As a result, the brokers had to function under very non conducive environments in carrying out their activities. As investor confidence was shattered with fear psychosis entering their minds both in terms of visiting their brokers and the chances of making a reasonable rate of return.
On the positive side, the stock exchange initiated a number of value addition measures to the Colombo bourse such as the commencement of the CDS (central depository system)system, the issue of monthly CDS statements to investors, permission to trade on margin trading basis, setting specific time limits for settlements, recruitment of experienced staff cadres especially investment advisors/client service managers, publication of investor education leaflets/brochures, conducting of training and awareness sessions/workshops in Colombo and outstation cities to broaden the base of investors, commencement of SIERRA accounts to facilitate investments of foreign investors.
During bearish times market attracted many institutional investors, both local and foreign to prop up turnovers. Local unit trusts and gilt edged funds started pouring into the bourse. This had a chain effect of drawing more retailers into the market.
The investors opened multiple accounts with a number of brokers some in their individual accounts and others in the name of their personal corporate business accounts. All in all the number of CDS accounts increased rapidly. The market had rallies on a number of occasions, namely, at the end of 1989 insurgency activities, sale of regional plantations in late 1991& especially during the last two years of the 17 year UNP rule as a result of the country showing steady GDP growth rates due to a number of privatisations carried out by the government. The bourse was affected by the Tsunami, political regime changes, escalation of north east hostilities,1997/8 asian financial crisis etc. . The market took a steadily upward movement path with the total ending of north/east hostilities and steadily climbed up reaching great heights. The ASPI reached 7,800 levels a few years back due to heavy profit taking by the investors. The market then headed for a correction later and is now on a consolidation stage.
The all share price was at 1,378 point level in march 1994 and has grown to its present level of 6,100 indicating the growth of the stock market from 1994 upto now. The market is now heading for higher grounds and very much will depend on the corporate results achieved by the listed companies for financial year ending 31 march 2017.The annual reports and annual general meetings are usually due from the end of may 2017 in respect of the financial year ending March 31,2017.
Credit should go to the stock exchange and securities and exchange commission authorities for propelling the market through many rough seas from time to time. Certain circumstances specifically the external ones are beyond their control and still they have managed to hold the bourse to steady and reasonable levels. Value addition measures recently decided by the CSE and SEC augurs well for the future development of the bourse.The bourse is now attracting investors from many countries.
The SEC organized many road shows and promotional activities overseas and have developed healthy relationships with overseas fund managers. Over the years. The overseas fund managers regularly visit Colombo to ascertain facts and evaluate results and progress made at our bourse before convincing the equity investors back home.
Looking into the plans and vision of the Colombo stock exchange for the next financial year due to start on 1 April 2017,the board of directors have decided on a number of initiatives to bolster the market with the following objectives in mind.
1.Improving the daily and annual turnover of the market
2.Improving the liquidity of the market
3.Enhancing of the investor confidence in the market
4.Augmentation of the levy collections for the inland revenue
5.Steady rise in market capitalisation
6.Overall value addition to the market
7.Initiation of more initial public offerings into the market
8.Direct contribution to the economic growth strategies of the government
10.Enforcement of strict compliance measures pertaining to the listed companies Some of the specific measures are enumerated below.
1.Veryshortly,the Colombo stock exchange will be holding road shows, fund manager
conferences, seminars & presentations in Australia and New Zealand targeting especially the large srilankan population in these countries in addition to country specific funds, business groups, etc.. Both countries and srilanka belong to the commonwealth and enjoy excellent bilateral ties in addition to cricketing and rugby ties.
2.The opening of the dollar board, initially for the investors of the SAARC region. The relevant memorandum of understanding has already been signed with Maldives.
3."AON" trading-This refers to All or None basis where strategic parcels are offered in respect of listed companies. This will be a very transparent mode of "real time bidding". The CSE is confident that the turnover levels and liquidity of the market will improve with this initiative.
4.roposed shifting of the Colombo stock exchange office in Hambantotato the town of Ambalantota As Ambalantota is closer to many business towns like Tangalle and Embilipitiya
5.oad shows and promotions in specific countries who are keen to invest in the Colombo bourse in liaison with srilankan diplomatic missions abroad and overseas diplomatic missions in srilanka.
Some of the core statistics pertaining to the Colombo stock exchange in recent times are highlighted below for the benefit and information of investors and the corporate sector.
1.The CSE has been contributing to the treasury by way of STL(share transaction levy). Quantums of STL remitted to the inland revenue during the past five years are shown below.
2.Foreign and local investment levels 2017 (upto 7 march) 2016
A. Daily average Turnover (Rs.Millions) 676.9 737.2
B. Contribution to Total Market Turnover
Foreign 48% 42%
Local 52% 58%
C. Break up of Foreign Turnover
Foreign companies 46.8% 41%
Foreign Induviduals 1.2% 1%
D. Break up of Local Turnover
Local companies 32.5% 30.9%
Local Individuals 19.5% 27.1%
E. Foreign Trading Activities January 2017 February 20177 days upto7 march 2017
Purchases (Rs. Million) 5,507.6 6,488.8 2,590.5
Sales (Rs. Million) 7,164.6 4,902.2 1,360.8
Net Foreign Flow (Rs.Million) (1,656.9) 1,586.6 1,239.7
On a positive note for 2017, upto March 7 the Colombo bourse recorded a net foreign inflow of
Rs.1,169.4 million.
The present market capitalization as a percentage of GDP is around 28% and the CSE is hoping to achieve a level of around 50% in around 3 to 4 years. Very recently, the FITCH ratings upgraded the "B+" CREDIT rating for Srilanka to "Stable" from "Negative". This upgrading will assist the Colombo stock exchange in their future promotions immensely in both overseas and srilanka.
From an investor point of view the following recommendations are presented below for Implementation by the brokers in a collective capacity for a clear picture of daily transaction summary.
1.Daily electronic and print media should also highlight the major contributing stocks for the daily Turnover in addition to the top gainers and top losers for the benefit of investors.
2.Some countries publish P/E ratios in daily newspapers alongside the individual stocks when presenting the price movements of individual stocks. As a result, a demand will be created for stocks with lower P/E ratios
3.Some listed companies take an unusually longer time for submission of annual audited accounts to the exchange followed by the annual general meetings. Some companies also report lower profitabilities lower than the total of figures disclosed in quarterly accounts, after the audit. Thestockbrokers should educate the investment advisors to make a concise and clear explanation to their clients explaining reasons as some clients purchase shares based on quarterly results.
4.Daily market summary should be presented under business news in all major television and radio channels in their prime time news bulletines in all languages. This measure will lure more investors to the market including households and self employed.
On the part of listed companies, they should regularly engage in fruitful CSR initiatives to win the confidence of the general public at large and also to send a strong signal to the investing community as to their good work for community development.
The stability of the stocks and the market as a whole will depend very much on the following factors as well which are beyond the control of CSE and its management.
1.Interest rates of the country
2.GDP growth
3.Strength of rupee
4.Tax policies of the ruling government
5.Level of public savings
6.International image of our economy abroad
7.Local& Foreign debt levels of the country and debt servicing requirements
8.Level of inflation
9.Trade union action in different industries of the country
10.Transaction costs
11.Level of foreign investor sales and net foreign flows to the bourse
12.Instituitional & retailer interest
13.Security situation of the country
14.Infrastructure obstacles such as power shortages in the country
15.Political instability
In a new development, stock brokers are now required to report their capital adequacy ratios to the securities & exchange commission(SEC) & Colombo stock exchange(CSE) daily compared to the past practice of reporting net capital positions at the end of each month.
Education of the investors, especially the retailers is also of paramount importance. They should realize that the bourse is not a gaming board where they can make gains as they wish.
They should firstly look for a return in excess of the prevailing bank rates. Secondly, the investors should carry out a detailed research and find out which way the shares they bought are heading with the assistance of their brokers aided by quarterly and annual results, dividend streams expected together with market sensitive news.
Based on these facts, the investors should decide on the dates of sales and prices so that they can receive a return rate exceeding the prevailing bank interest rate. Share purchases based on speculation should be discouraged as far as possible unless the investors possess sufficient holding power.
Attraction of international funds depend very much on us interest rates and the decisions of the Federal Reserve. In addition global depressions, terrorist attacks, international energy prices and IMF predictions also play their parts from time to time.

Exception to the rule: Ex-CB Governor at Market Operation Committee meeting
Former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran was present at the Market Operation Committee meeting held on February 27, 2015, Monetary Board Secretary H.A. Karunaratne said.
He said it was unusual for a Central Bank Governor to be present at a Market Operation Committee (MOC) meeting.
Asked if it was usual for former Governor Mahendran to attend such meetings, Karunaratne said it was not the case.
Karunaratne said the former Governor wanted to discuss overnight deposit interest rates and the 2tier system. He said Mahendran instructed to make changes to a circular to abolish the 2tier system and to raise the interest rates.
Mahendran said that keeping a fixed 5 percent interest rate is suppressive and that it would not draw a clear picture of the market, Karunaratne said.
MOC members include Assistant Governors in charge of Economic Policy and Market Operations, Head of the Economic Research Department and the Director of the International Operation Department.

Explosion in Thalassemia
Thalassemia surveillance estimates 200 to 300 marriages between two carriers and an incidence of 60 to 80 thalassemia patients each year in the country.
The National Thalassemia Prevalence Survey in 2011 identified 1,231 patients in 0  79 age category, Consultant Community Physician Dr. Kapila Jayaratne said.
According to Dr. Jayaratne, the current technology allows the detection of birth defects during 18 to 20 weeks of gestation.
A combination of scientific disciplines gives some understanding of how these mishaps occur; means of detecting some of them prenatally, at even earlier stages of development; and, ways to remedy or palliate few of those detected. However, ethics of fetal anomaly scans in the absence of termination as an option has generated much discussion as well as controversies.
Dr. Jayaratne pointed out that giving birth to a baby with a birth defect is devastating to parents.
It may result in long-term disability and have a major psychosocial impact not only on the individual but on all family members. The effects are felt beyond the family. They pose a burden to the society and to the healthcare system. Both WHO-multi country survey global and Sri Lanka data showed that newborn babies with birth defects had higher incidence of neonatal complications and increased risk for morbidity including low birth weight, preterm delivery, and admission to intensive care units compared to those without birth defects, he said.
They required significantly higher amount of intervention procedures (Nasal CPAP), medications (anti convulsants, phototherapy, blood products, steroids and intravenous antibiotic medication) compared to other newborns and also were at higher risk for surgical interventions, he added.

Federer beats Wawrinka for fifth Indian Wells title
INDIAN WELLS Monday: Roger Federer claimed a record-equalling fifth ATP Indian Wells Masters title on Sunday, continuing his career resurgence with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over Stan Wawrinka.
Federer, sidelined some six months after knee surgery last year, returned to win his 18th Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January.
With Sunday's triumph in the all-Swiss final, Federer joined Novak Djokovic as the only men to win five Indian Wells titles, adding to those he won in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2012.
At 35, Federer is the oldest ATP player to win one of the elite Masters titles, supplanting Andre Agassi who was 34 when he won in Cincinnati in 2004.
It's been just a fairytale week once again, said Federer, who missed Indian Wells last year because of injury.
I'm not as surprised as I was in Australia, but still this comes as a big, big surprise to me, nevertheless, to win here again and beating the players that I did and the way I did.
I couldn't be more happy. It's an absolute, huge start to the year for me. Last year I didn't win any titles. I don't think I was in any finals except maybe Brisbane last year. The change is dramatic, and it feels great. The speedy progress means 10th-ranked Federer will have to reassess his 2017 goals. Prior to the Australian Open his aim was to get his ranking to as high as eighth by the time Wimbledon was over.
The goals are clearly changing after this dream start, Federer said.
While Federer had won 19 of 22 prior meetings with Wawrinka -- including a semi-final win in Melbourne -- he noted that his compatriot would be no easy mark as he played his first tournament in America since winning the US Open in September.
But Federer claimed a tightly contested first set with a break in the 10th game, pushing Wawrinka into a forehand error to end a tense rally for a set point, on which Wawrinka sent another forehand long.
Wawrinka responded immediately with a break to open the first set -- after Federer had held all 42 of his service games in the tournament to that point.
He had saved the lone break point he faced -- in his straight-sets thumping of Rafael Nadal in the fourth round -- but sent a backhand long on break point to give Wawrinka the advantage in the set.
Wawrinka then withstood two break points to hold for a 2-0 lead, which proved short-lived as Federer won the next three games to take a 3-2 lead.
Wawrinka a Federer fan
Finally Wawrinka found himself serving to save the match. A backhand into the net gave Federer a chance, and he seized it with a volley winner.
I've lost some tough ones against you, but when you played the final in Australia, I was your biggest fan, a choked up Wawrinka told Federer at the trophy ceremony. So congratulations on your comeback and congratulations on today. Although he owns three Grand Slam titles, Wawrinka was playing in just his fourth Masters final and has won just one of the prestige events -- beating Federer in the final at Monte Carlo in 2014.
It's a tough loss, he said. In a way, I'm really happy to make the final. It's a great result on that, but you always want more. After fearing that knee trouble in the wake of the Australian Open would slow his season, Wawrinka was pleased to play at a high level. After Australia, I wasn't in a good position, he said. I was really, really struggling with my knee. I wasn't sure to be back here in that level that quick. But I still lost the final, he said. So it wasn't easy.  -AFP

FM pledges fiscal discipline, adherence to IMFs demand  to cap budget deficit
Hong Kong - The Sri Lankan government has pledged its commitment to strong fiscal discipline in line with conditions stipulated for a bailout by the IMF.
We should have a national vision to address burning issues in the economy, including fiscal-sector operations, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, told the FinanceAsia Sri Lanka Investment Summit in Hong Kong on Thursday.
He said the best way for Sri Lanka to move forward is through fiscal consolidation supported by reforms in tax policy and administration.
We set our target at 3.5% of budget deficit by 2020. And we gradually ensure the impacts of fiscal consolidation coming in, Karunanayake said, reiterating that the government is targeting a budget deficit of 4.6% this year -- 10 basis points below the IMFs projection.
Karunanayake indicated that the government could grow its revenue to 15.3% of the countrys gross domestic product from 13.8% last year, made possible by a higher rate of value-added tax and by relying more on public-private partnerships to lessen the expenditure burden.
He was confident that government expenditures would be controlled because projects would be implemented on the basis of necessity and would have to go through the national plan system, whereby market-oriented analysis would be applied regarding their feasibility.
For the first time, in 2017, the total revenue of the government [will] exceed the recurrent expenditure, said Karunanayake, adding that surpluses would be put toward debt repayments. Fitch Ratings, which revised its outlook on Sri Lanka to stable from negative last month, said the countrys exchange rate could face downward pressure in the case of a shift in investor sentiment and as authorities allow for greater exchange rate flexibility.

Footballer killed in croc attack
Maputo: A young Mozambican football player was snatched and killed by a crocodile while training along the banks of a river, his club said on Monday.
Estevao Alberto Gino, 19, who played for Mozambiques second division club Atletico Mineiro de Tete, lived near the Zambezi river in the western province of Tete. The incident happened last Thursday.
On that night, he was training and after jogging he stretched his hands into the water and that was when the crocodile caught him, coach Eduardo Carvalho told AFP.
Two neighbours who witnessed the attack estimated the crocodile to have been about five-metres (16-feet) long, and they could not do anything to save him, said Carvalho.
Crocodile attacks are common along the Zambezi river.
Local police spokesman Leonel Muchina confirmed the incident to AFP saying the footballers body has not yet been found. AFP

G20 finance ministers drop anti-protectionist pledge
Finance ministers from the world's biggest economies have dropped an anti-protectionist commitment after opposition from the US.
G20 ministers left the two-day meeting without renewing their long-standing pledge to bolster free trade.Last year, the group of the world's 20 largest economies vowed to resist all forms of protectionism.
But since then, President Donald Trump has taken office, and is aggressively pursuing an America First policy.His policies include penalties for companies which manufacture their products abroad.
Speaking after the meeting ended, US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he would not read too much into his country's desire to change the language behind the communique, as what was as in the past releases was not relevant.
Mr Mnuchin added he had been very clear that we do believe in free trade but we believe in balanced trade.The communique, which was published at the end of the meeting in Baden-Baden with the agreement of all attending delegates, also failed to include a vow on climate change.
Mr Trump has already promised to slash environmental funding.
The exclusion of the two issues in the communique was disappointing, French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said.I regret that our discussions today were unable to reach a satisfying conclusion on two absolutely essential priorities that our world and which France would have liked to see the G20 continue to take firm and concerted action on.
However, it did include pledges on a determination to fight tax avoidance, clamp down on terrorist financing and strengthen private investment in Africa.Reaching an impasse: Joe Miller, BBC News, Baden-Baden
It started so well. With the sun shining in the German spa town of Baden-Baden, the first annual meeting of the G20 got under way with a reassurance from the US Treasury secretary Steve Muchin that the White House was not interested in instigating international trade wars. The combined efforts of Germany, and nascent free-trade champions China, it was thought, would temper some of Washington's threats of imposing punishing border tariffs and renegotiating long-standing trade agreements.
But two days later, the communique approved by all the assembled finance ministers was published without a commitment to bolster free trade and dropped a pledge to resist all forms of protectionism from the previous year's document.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble said the meeting had reached an impasse when it came to the issue, and added that his counterparts could not force partners - read the United States - to go along with wording with which they don't agree.
Schauble insisted that there had been a lot of goodwill at the meeting, but whether that goodwill extends to the future trade relationship with the world's largest economy is now very much in doubt. (BBC)

Gazette minimum standards of medical education: GMOA
A letter had been sent to Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne requesting him to gazette the existing minimum standards of the medical education within two weeks. The duration ends on March 30, Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said. Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the minimum standard of the medical education in Sri Lanka existed for decades but according to the Court of Appeal ruling, it is not a law.
Therefore, the GMOA requested Minister Dr. Senaratne to issue the gazette notification making it a law. The GMOA will never let anyone or any organisation to lower the existing minimum standard of medical education. it can be updated and improved, he said.
Dr. Aluthge, said the GMOA along with all the other organisations will take stern action by the first week of next month if the Government does not take a decision on the issue.
It can be countrywide strike or something else. We appeal President Maithripala Sirisena to take action to halt so called final year examination for the third batch of `medical students from the SAITM and the intake of students.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said it is very pathetic to see how the owner of a fraudulent company act above the countrys law no matter which Government in power. Cabinet Ministers support him without supporting the state bodies.
When a low quality company comes up, the institution which safeguard the high quality is threatened by many. Attacking the SLMC and its members means attacking the rights of patients.

GMOA condemns attack on members vehicle
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) vehemently condemn the attack on a vehicle of a member of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
They do not hesitate to take countrywide trade union action if the Government continue to kill time without taking a decision on the SAITM, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said it is nothing new about attacking the SLMC Chairmen and its members. Former SLMC Chairman Dr. Nonis was brutally attacked in the past and then a bomb was thrown at Dr. Lalantha Ranasinghe. No action was taken in any of those incidents.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the vehicle of a SLMC member was entirely damaged.
The police should conduct an unbiased and transparent investigations into the incident and take the culprits into custody not acting like the way they acted in connection with the SAITM CEO shooting incident, which was overlooked without taking action against the persons who staged the `drama.
When a suspect came to the police station, he was sent back stating that there is no legal provisions to arrest him.
Dr. Zoysa said action should be taken against all who speak against the SLMC, which is a state body set up to protect the Medical Ordinance, an act passed in the Parliament to safeguard the rights of the patients.
The Government was given time until March 30 to take action against the attackers and to take a decision on the SAITM and the GMOA will take the decision thereafter, he said.

The great betrayal
A comedy of sorts is about to being enacted in Geneva, where the self appointed guardian of Sri Lankas security forces, Rt. Real Admiral Ananda Weerasekera, will unfold a dossier containing material exonerating our war heroes of any wrongdoing, while likeminded colleague from the army Rt. Major General Kamal Gunaratne has scored an own goal, giving out details, liberally, of atrocities committed by the security forces during the Eelam war, in his recently released book, titled , Road to Nandikadal. This, at a time when the government has received much needed breathing space in the form of a two year extension to fulfill its commitments made on the UNHRC joint resolution. According to an English Weekend publication, quoting Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, the Tamil diaspora has gone into overdrive, distributing copies of the book to buttress their claim of atrocities committed by the security forces against Tamil civilians and also circulated volumes in Geneva during the UNHRC sessions. Samaraweera told journalists at his ministry last week, the 741 page volume gives explicit details of atrocities committed by the forces against Tamils in the North and the tone and tenor of the commentary of the author suggests that he took a perverse pleasure in inflicting pain on the Tamil civilians.
It goes without saying that considerable damage had been done to the military by the exposures in the book by the very people who portray themselves as protectors of the countrys war heroes, holding them sacrosanct and even accusing the government of victimizing members of forces by arraigning them for various criminal acts. What is more, the carefully thought out efforts by the government to counter the allegations made against the war heroes, has, no doubt, been blown into smithereens by the contents of this book which was launched under the stewardship of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. MR apparently had not read the contents or it would have been doubtful if he would have graced the event, if one is to go by his rhetoric, disporting himself as the champion of our security forces.
It cannot be a coincidence that the Tamil National Alliance has stepped up its call for a hybrid court, inclusive of foreign judges, to try our war heroes, now that the contents of the book has become public. It also cannot be a coincidence that TNA, and Opposition Leader, R. Sampanthan has claimed that over 150,000 Tamils were killed during the war and nearly 50% of the Tamil population fled the country during the three decades conflict, addressing a function in New Delhi last week. One also recalls TNA MP P. Sumanthiran insisting on a hybrid court, on the grounds that justice will not be served to the Tamils under Sri Lankas courts, following the verdict of a Sinhala speaking jury exonerating the accused in the Raviraj murder. Now the contents of the Rtd. Major Generals book may come like manna from heaven to Sumanthiran, and the more militant Tamil politicians such as Sivajilingam, to press their claims for a hybrid court. The book may also go onto buttress their long held claim that over 40,000 Tamils civilians perished during the war at the hands of the security forces.
One also cannot help coming to the conclusion that the Rtd. Major Generals book has not served the cause of the war heroes, whom the author is so passionate about. Nay, the conclusion will be inescapable that the allegations against the so called war heroes, now being held for various criminal acts, are indeed not without foundation. Hence, Rt. Major General Kapila Gunaratne has dealt a double whammy on the security forces, while trying to garnish his book with explicit details he would have been well advised to have left out.
The Rtd. Major Generals revelations have certainly upset the apple cart for the Joint Opposition, which have been defending the record of the security forces with a vengeance and accused the Yahapalanaya Government of engaging in a witch-hunt of the countrys war heroes at the behest of the West and the Tamil Diaspora. Now, one of their own agents has handed over the necessary evidence on a platter to the enemies of the state. Besides, as a head of a military unit during the war years, in the eyes of the international community, there would be no reason to doubt the Rtd. Major General Gunaratnes claims. The damage has been done and no amount of rhetoric from the Joint Opposition could reverse the thinking planted in the minds of the interested parties that the forces had indeed committed atrocities against civilians.
The government, for its part, should take measures to scrutinize books written on the war. We are not aware if there is an appointed authority to inspect the contents of books, like the Public Performance Board for films. We are also not aware if Road to Nandikadal was subjected to vetting. More books on the war are in the pipeline. It would be prudent if these books are not released willy nilly but subject to close scrutiny, even though, it must be said, that the horse has already bolted.

HC re-issues summons on President, PM to testify in Tissa Attanayake case
The Colombo High Court yesterday re-issued summons on President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to appear before Colombo High Court on July 17 to testify in the case filed against UNP former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election for the purpose of affecting the result of then Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena.
When the matter came up before High Court Judge Wikum Kaluarachchi, the Court was informed that the President and Prime Minister, the key witnesses in the case had sent their written notifications informing Court that they would be unable to appear in Court yesterday since they have to perform several official duties. Accordingly, the case was put off for trial on a day-to-day basis commencing from July 17 to July 28. The rest of the witnesses from witness number three to fifteen were advised to appear in Court on the next trial date. Meanwhile, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim appeared in Court as the thirteenth witness in the case. Additional Solicitor General Wasantha Navaratne Bandara PC with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with counsel Kanchana Ratwatta and Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for Tissa Attanayake.
UNP former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake had been arrested and held in remand custody for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election by inciting racial or religious hatred among ethnic communities. He is currently out on bail.
The accused had been charged under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007. This is the first time in Sri Lanka an accused had been indicted in the High Court by the Attorney General over an offence that comes under the ICCPR Act.
The Attorney General alleged that Tissa Attanayake had publicly announced on December 22, 2014 that there was a secret agreement between the then Common Opposition Candidate Maithripala Sirisena and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Attorney General alleged that Tissa Attanayake committed an offence under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007 by inciting racial or religious hatred among ethnic communities.
Section 3(1) of the ICCPR cites that no person shall propagate war or advocate national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to cause discrimination, hostility or violence.
The AG further alleged that Tissa Attanayake had committed a punishable offence under Sections 454 and 459 of the Penal Code by forging a document and displaying it to the public as genuine and that the accused had also committed an offence under Section 80-C of the Presidential Election Act for displaying a fake document prior to an election, for the purpose of affecting the result of that election in relation to the personal character or conduct of any candidate.
The AG has listed 15 persons including President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim as witnesses in the case.

Human activity main cause for water scarcity: CBK
Man can survive without food for five to six days but he cannot survive without water even for a day. Our water resources are depleting day-by-day due to our own mistakes, said former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
She was addressing the ceremony to mark Water Day at the Embilipitiya D. A. Rajapaksha Centre on March 17.
Kumaratunga said 10 to 12 years ago Sri Lankas population stood at 10-12 million. But today it had increased to 22 million. But, the water resources had not correspondingly increased with the population increase.
She said there were ample water resources in the Western and Central Provinces earlier. But wells and tube wells in these areas totally dried up during the severe drought experienced about four months ago.
The former President recalled that she launched special drinking water supply projects during her tenure in office. Some young officials who met her tried out a scheme to store rain water in tanks very successfully. When they tried to implement this scheme on a large scale, certain MPs and officials objected to it as they lost the opportunity to earn commissions from water supply projects. However, she successfully implemented this scheme by providing funding from the Presidents fund.
There were 15,000 water tanks in the NCP and the programme was later extended to areas such as Halmillara where nearly 150 water tanks were built.
Kumaratunga said President Maithripala Sirisena had launched the Moragahakanda project to provide water supplies to the North since the provision of water from this project would take some time, she as chairperson of the Reconciliation Commission will be taking steps to provide water tanks for storing rain water to households in Jaffna with the assistance of the Indian government. It is also hoped to widen the Iranamadu tank to increase its capacity.
She said she would also request the Provincial Education Minister who was present on the occasion to launch a tree planting campaign on one single day in all schools in the Province with the participation of school children.
Mass Media Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranawithana said the Kalu Ganga and Walawe Ganga, the two rivers which flowed across the Ratnapura District had faced serious threat due to human activity. As such provision of water to areas such as Balangoda had become a big problem. They would launch a programme to plant one million Kumbuk trees in and around water sources in the Ratnapura area to ensure the protection of water resources in the area.
The former President also distributed prizes and certificates among winners of an inter school paintings competition held in the Embilipitiya zone.

Jaguars I-Pace concept to make European Motor  Show debut at Geneva
Jaguars electric performance SUV concept will showcase one of the production cars First Edition colours ' Photon Red ' when it appears at the Geneva Motor Show on 7 March.
The concept previews Jaguars first electric vehicle, the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be available in 2018.
With the I-Pace Concept weve torn up the rule book to create a vehicle with supercar looks, sports car performance and SUV space, in one electric package. Our design and engineering teams have taken full advantage of the opportunities presented by electrification: a cab-forward, sporting driving position, exceptional interior space and, of course, zero tailpipe emissions and instant acceleration.
The dramatic silhouette and powerful proportions are only possible because we consciously exploited every millimetre given by the state-of-the-art electric drive system. The I-PACE Concept represents the next generation of battery electric vehicle design, said Ian Callum, Director of Design, Jaguar.
The I-Pace will be a long distance sprinter that accelerates to 60 mph in around 4 seconds, with a range of more than 500km (NEDC cycle) from the 90kWh lithium-ion battery. Charging is easy and quick, with 80 per cent charge achieved in just 90 minutes using 50kW DC charging.
Compact, lightweight electric motors at the front and rear axles generate a combined output of 400PS and 700Nm of torque, with the all-weather benefits of all-wheel drive. The I-PACE will also deliver the agility, ride comfort and refinement that will set it apart from all other electric vehicles: it will be a true Jaguar and a true drivers car.

Kim and the Art of Warfare..!
Kim Jong Un, the revolutionary leader of North Korea stood in his wrestling gear in the arena facing the rest of the world. He walked up to one of his still living uncles sitting on the edge of the ring and whispered in his rear, Just watch, I will go across to where Trump sits and make a monkey face at him! Watch, and learn the art of warfare!
His uncle clapped and gave him a standing ovation as the bespectacled portly Korean walked over to the other side of the ring, as far away as he could get from the American side, then started making ludicrously ridiculous faces at the Americans.
He walked over to his uncle, How was that he asked, Did you see the American president cringe with fear
You are the greatest! said his uncle.
Greater than my father, Kim Jong Il asked Kim Jong Un staring at his uncle fixedly, while fingering a small dagger he kept within his wrestling garb.
Of course, wise leader, you are far greater than your father, or even your grandfather!
They would have not done what I am doing! said the cherubic looking North Korean dictator, making another face at the American president, and again earning the applause of his subjects sitting in the corner of the ring. I can do more! said Kim, as he jumped up and down gesticulating wildly at the American side, even doing a summersault and a cartwheel, but safely keeping a distance from the American president while doing his antics.
I just saw the American president flinch when you did that cartwheel, oh Sun of the Nationl! said his only living uncle.
Then Ill do it again, said Kim Jong Un, and did another half cartwheel, landing on his soft underbelly, Ha, ha, ha, that should keep him quiet about nuclear attacks for some time! he said to his uncle who nodded vigorously.
Kim stopped his exhibitionist acts as he heard a noise that rose in crescendo. It sounded like the moans and groans, the cries and sobs of millions. Whats that he asked, then looked around as the hall was filled with voices, Bread! cried a weak Korean voice.
We are hungry! wept another.
No food in our belly!
No clothes on our backs!
All our money paying to keep your antics going!
Shut up! shouted Kim Jong Un, the undisputed revolutionary leader of North Korea, Cant you see how much good has happened with your sacrifices Look at the American president. Look at how he cows down in front of me. Look at the rest of the world. See how scared they are of us, and you want food
Kim made a monkey face then jumped up and down again, gesticulating wildly at the American side, even doing a summersault and a cartwheel, safely keeping a distance from them while doing his antics.
His uncle clapped, his people moaned, the rest of the world went about their business as Kim taught them the art of warfare..!

Kong: Skull Island 3D : A roaring adventure
A bunch of scientists accompanied by a tracker (Tom Hiddleston), photo-journalist (Brie Larson) and army soldiers, infiltrate a mysterious, uncharted territory (Skull Island) to examine it, without realising they have entered the land of King Kong. While a few seek revenge from the mighty ape for killing their compatriots, they soon discover he is not the enemy.
You know exactly what to expect from this film before walking into it and it doesnt let you down. Given the genre, its no surprise that this monster movie is immensely formulaic but in its defence, it doesnt have one dull moment. Fast-paced and gripping, this reboot of the franchise is a taut survival drama that gives you the chills.
Sadly, no matter how talented, since Kong is the king, he renders the A-list cast redundant. His only competition is the monstrous lizards aka skull crawlers and the two giants pretty much rule the roost and hog the screen space, literally and figuratively.
Despite being clichd, you enjoy the two species slugging it out in the jungle as the humans run helter-skelter, becoming the mere spectators. The CGI-fuelled action in 3D keeps you on the edge of your seat. Watching Kong smash a fleet of helicopters to the ground as we tend to crush mosquitoes is oddly entertaining. The witty repartee between characters makes up for the lack of depth and drama in the screenplay.
While this instalment tries to match up to Peter Jacksons 2005 adventure, it lacks its epic cinematic moments, like Kong scaling the Empire State building. Though British actor Tom Hiddleston and Oscar winner Brie Larson have nothing much to do here except for gawking at the giants and running for their lives, they add credibility to this otherwise stereotypical franchise.
Leading to the big Kong vs Godzilla (2020) clash, if you dont mind some shallow, video game-esque entertainment, this one doesnt disappoint.

The new regulation explains that the construction of a new building required to obtain a safety clearance certificate from who owns or operates the overhead line (Ceylon Electricity Board or Lanka Electricity Company) through a written notice, explaining the intention to construct the building, if it cause any part of an overhead line.
However, a safety clearance certificate will not be issued and the building or structure should not be able to build if the distance from such building or structure is not in par with the spaces that has mentioned in the regulation to any part of the overhead line.
The Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry have already taken action to implement the regulation.
Accordingly, the regulation will be strictly considered when granting the permits for development purposes.
Therefore, the application for the development permit will require the information of the space clearance between the power lines and a new construction in the future.

Marsh, Handscomb help Australia draw 3rd Test
Ranchi: Skipper Steve Smith said the momentum was now firmly with Australia in their battle against India after a fine final-day rearguard action by his batsmen saw the visitors draw the third Test Monday.
Australia, who began their second innings 152 runs adrift of India, were in deep trouble after being reduced to 63-4 before Peter Handscomb (72 not out) and Shaun Marsh (53) put on 124 for the fifth wicket.
The tourists eventually reached 204 for 6 at stumps on the fifth and final day, after the hosts made a mammoth 603-9 declared in their first innings in Ranchi.
Ravindra Jadeja claimed four wickets to return overall match figures of 9-178 at Indias newest Test venue. But Smith said Australia would go into next weekends series finale in Dharamsala full of confidence.
If theres anything called momentum in cricket, its with our side at this moment, Smith told reporters after the match.
India coming today would have expected to bowl us out. Im sure theyre hurting a little bit in their change room. Having said that, its (four-match series) 1-1 and looking forward to the decider.
Cheteshwar Pujara (202) and Wriddhiman Saha (117) were the main stars of the match for India with a 199-run seventh-wicket stand on Sunday, while Smith himself scored an imperious unbeaten 178 in Australias first innings. But it was Handscomb and Marshs 232-minute resistance on the final day -- broken only late in the last session -- that proved decisive.
Jadeja dismissed Marsh and his fellow spinner Ravichandran Ashwin then claimed the wicket of first innings centurion Glenn Maxwell for two, giving India brief hope of a dramatic final twist in the tale.
But a composed Handscomb played out the remaining few overs with Wade for company as Australia avoided defeat in their 800th Test.
Im proud with the way the boys were able to stick it out today, said Smith.
The way Marsh and Handscomb batted today was fantastic. I thought they played beautifully. They didnt look like they were getting out for a while. Im really proud of them. Jadeja, who claimed the prized scalp of Smith for 21 second time round, caused problems for all the Australian batsmen after the tourists resumed the day on 23-2.
Fast bowler Ishant Sharma trapped Matt Renshaw lbw for 15 in the morning session after an altercation between the two players seemed to have affected the left-handed batsmans concentration.
But it was Smiths wicket that brought a raucous home crowd to its feet after a quiet first hour of play.
He tried to pad away a vicious turning delivery from Jadeja but it spun from outside leg to rattle the right-handers off stump.
Speaking at the post-match press-confrence, Kohli praised Jadeja and Pujara for putting India in a strong position after Australias first-innings 451.
Jadejas bowling was outstanding. He was high-class and proved why he is the joint top Test bowler along with Ashwin, said Kohli.
On man of the match Pujara, who registered his third Test double century, Kohli said: He is the most composed player in the team... someone like that is priceless to have him in the team.
Australias comeback paceman Pat Cummins claimed four wickets, including that of captain Kohli (6) who has managed just 46 runs in the series. Kohli, who injured his shoulder while fielding on the opening day, did not take the field for the rest of Australias innings but batted at his usual number four position. AFP

Mitra Innovation, a UK and Sri Lankan based company specialising in SaaS technology platform incubation, digital transformation and Cloud-to-Cloud integration, has developed Northern Irelands Kraydel, to build their innovative new healthcare technology platform and launch it onto the market.
Early March was a milestone in Kraydels history and for Mitra Innovation when the service was launched to potential buyers at DigiHealth UK, in London. Kraydel is an innovative new assisted living service that enables elderly people to live independently in their own homes.

The service also provides elderly people with peace of mind that help is just a click away, if they get into any mobility or medical difficulties.
Mitra Innovation helped Kraydel develop the cloud-based technology behind the business, and program the platform.
The DigiHealth UK event was designed to encourage and advance the best practices in digital healthcare innovation as well as promoting the very latest opportunities in the health and social care sector.

Monetary Board Secretary admits to confusion in personal notes and approved minutes
The Secretary to the Monetary Board yesterday acknowledged to certain confusions between his personal notes and the approved minutes pertaining to Monetary Board meetings.
Secretary to the Monetary Board H.A. Karunaratne answered in the affirmative when the Presidential Commission to inquire into the Treasury Bond issue asked whether he has included his own wordings and interpretations into his personal notes as he was manually recording Monetary Board meetings. The Presidential Commission pointed out to Karunaratne that he is assigned to record what goes on in the meeting and not to include his personal interpretations of what is discussed at the Monetary Board meetings.
The confusion between Karunaratnes notes and the approved minutes was laid bare when Karunaratne told the Commission that Deputy Governor P. Samarasiri requested him to make amendments to the draft minutes of the Tender Board meeting held on February 23, 2015.
At this meeting, the Governor asked if the CBSL can issue one billion dollar sovereign bonds. He also asked if it is possible to issue half a billion dollar sovereign bonds for 30 years. He also asked about thirty year Rupee Bonds in the local market. DG Ananda Silva said to the Governor that there is not enough liquidity in the market. Karunaratne explained.
So in my personal notes, I wrote down that the Governor requested to explore the possibilities of issuing 30 year bonds, Karunaratne said.
The Commission then requested Karunaratne to read out a portion from his personal notes based on which prepared the draft minute.
The Governor asked, should we have a 30 year bond auction He also mentions the previous Governor also thought of issuing 0.5 billion sovereign bonds in dollars for 30 years as well. This is to facilitate the repayments and the bunging to be sorted out, Governor also says to issue to the local market 30 year treasury bonds this week. Karunaratne read out.
Supreme Court Justice P. Jayawardane asked Karunaratne from where the wording to explore the possibilities of issuing 30 year treasury bonds came into his personal notes.
What we gather from your notes is that the Governor has given a clear order to issue limited amount of 30 year bonds within that week. Jayawardane pointed out.
Karunaratne said he wrote it down so because the DG Ananda Silva let the Governor know that there is not enough liquidity in the market to follow the instruction.
DG Samarasiri asked me to change my wording to the Monetary Board instructed the SPD to raise 30 year treasury bonds within the week. My original draft minute was given to the DGs on February 26, 2015. So when DG Samarasiri wanted me to change my wording the questioned auction was already over, Karunaratne said.
Justice Jayawardane pointed out to Karunaratne that he should not include his personal understanding of the discussions into the minutes of the Monetary Board to which Karunaratne repeated his earlier explanation.
The Commission pointed out to Karunaratne that he cannot interpret the discussions and the Commission will judge from your notes whether he has done a proper recording or not.
The Secretary to the Tender Board was requested to provide his personal notes to be analyzed comparatively with the approved Monetary Board minutes.
Karunaratne was testifying before the Presidential Commission to inquire on the Treasury Bond Issue. State Counsel Shaheeda Barrie led the evidence.

Ceylon Tobacco Company (CTC) bestowed the company's highest honour, the Chairman's Award, on Brands Manager/Planning and Insights Manager, Naveed Anjoon in recognition of his efforts in launching six consumer relevant brands across almost all consumer segments within a 12-month period.
The mastermind behind developing and executing the meticulous cycle plan that made this possible, Anjoon targeted the premium consumers segment as well as the price pressured lower segment, with just a two-man team for the task.

"It's a great feeling when everyone gives you a standing ovation.I am overwhelmed and so happy to win this award! I was under tremendous pressure throughout the year to achieve these milestones and being rewarded for it makes me happy as it shows that your hard work has been recognised - my passion was to get these done and put in 300%, which I'm really proud of," Naveed said.
"You can't achieve this on your own. It was a collective team effort, especially my team,Trade Marketing team and the Supply Chain team. I must add that the entire company supported us and had the trust in me that it was all going to happen - it wasn't only the internal colleagues but also the external stakeholders - everyone was stretched and we pulled it through."
Commenting on the award itself, Naveed observed that he feels it is required for a company as it is something people are inspired by. "It makes a big difference, I've felt it and it pushes you to reach greater heights and all organisations should have an award of this calibre."

New Zealand unchanged for 3rd South Africa Test
Wellington: New Zealands squad will remain unchanged for the third Test against South Africa in Hamilton despite the mauling the Black Caps received in Wellington, chief selector Gavin Larsen said Monday.
Larsen ruled out an overhaul after New Zealand slumped to an eight-wicket loss within three days in the second Test in Wellington, insisting the countrys best players were already in the squad.
Weve got 100 percent faith in the fact that weve got what we think is the best group of Test cricketers in the country and a Test match to win in Hamilton, he told reporters. Larsen said strike bowler Trent Boult, who missed the second Test with a sore leg, was hopeful about starting in Hamilton on Saturday.
But he said batting stalwart Ross Taylor was expected to miss another Test as he recovers from a calf tear. AFP

Oil prices entering bearish trend despite supply deal
Oil prices have entered a bearish trend despite short-term bounces, supply cuts and improved demand estimates.
The lateral range of $50-$55 a barrel was recently broken, with the new long-term support level for Brent edging closer to $45-$47 rather than $50 a barrel. With money managers' net length exposure to crude prices at the highest level in months, the risks for oil prices seem tilted to the downside. There are various reasons for this trend. The supply cut deal struck between members of the oil-producing cartel OPEC and non-members is ineffective and under question. We read everywhere that compliance is 90 percent, but Saudi Arabia is, in reality, the only member that is reducing output by a lot more than agreed according to OPEC figures (130,000 barrels per day cut above its agreed production), while Russia is at almost at a third (118,000 b/d versus the agreed 300,000 b/d). Meanwhile Emirates, Kuwait, Venezuela, Algeria and others are between 50 percent and 60 percent compliance on the agreed cuts. Only Angola is cutting more than announced.
This reliance on Saudi Arabia doing all the work is dangerous. Saudi Arabia has already announced it will increase output above 10 million barrels per day in February.

Oracle Corporations Q3 FY17 GAAP EPS up
Oracle Corporation recently announced fiscal 2017 Q3 results. Total Revenues were $9.2 billion, up 2% in US dollars and up 3% in constant currency. Non-GAAP Total Revenues were $9.3 billion, up 3% in US dollars and up 4% in constant currency.
Cloud software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) revenues were $1.0 billion, up 73% in US dollars and up 74% in constant currency. Non-GAAP SaaS and PaaS revenues were $1.1 billion, up 85% in US dollars and up 86% in constant currency.
Total Cloud Revenues, including infrastructure as a service (IaaS), were $1.2 billion, up 62% in US dollars and up 63% in constant currency. Total Cloud and On-Premise Software Revenues were $7.4 billion, up 4% in US dollars and up 5% in constant currency.
Operating Income was $3.0 billion and Operating Margin was 32%. Non-GAAP Operating Income was $3.9 billion, up 3% in US dollars and up 4% in constant currency, and non-GAAP Operating Margin was 43%.
Net Income was $2.2 billion while non-GAAP Net Income was $2.9 billion, up 6% in US dollars and up 7% in constant currency. Earnings Per Share was $0.53, while non-GAAP Earnings Per Share was $0.69, up 7% in U.S. dollars. Without the impact of the US dollar strengthening compared to foreign currencies, Oracles reported GAAP Earnings Per Share would have been 1 cent higher.
Short-term deferred revenues were $7.4 billion, up 7% in US dollars and constant currency compared with a year ago. Operating cash flow on a trailing twelve-month basis was $13.5 billion.
The hyper-growth we continue to experience in the cloud has rapidly driven both our SaaS and PaaS businesses to scale, said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz. On an annualized non-GAAP basis, our total cloud business has reached the $5 billion mark, and our SaaS and PaaS businesses grew at the astonishing rate of 85% in Q3.
Over the last year, we sold more new SaaS and PaaS than Salesforce.com, and were growing more than 3 times faster, said Oracle CEO, Mark Hurd. If these trends continue, where we are selling more SaaS and PaaS in absolute dollars AND growing dramatically faster, its just a matter of when we catch and pass Salesforce.com in total cloud revenue.
Both our SaaS and PaaS businesses are doing great, but Im even more excited about our second generation IaaS business, said Oracle Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison. Our new Gen2 IaaS is both faster and lower cost than Amazon Web Services. And now our biggest customers can run their largest and most demanding Oracle database workloads in the Oracle Cloud  something that is absolutely impossible to do in the Amazon Cloud.

Plan to curb terror, boost maritime security likely at India National Security Advisers' Summit

India will push for a joint action plan to counter terrorism, de-radicalise potential recruits, and enhance maritime security in the Bay of Bengal region when it hosts on Tuesday the first meeting of the national security advisers (NSA) to the seven BIMSTEC countries.
The BIMSTEC is a crucialregionalplatform in India's strategy for ending cross-border extremism as theSAARC, the South Asian grouping, has failed to achieve its security goals because of Pakistan's ambivalence in approving the counter-terror convention.
At their meeting in Goa last October, the seven BIMSTEC leaders had decided to hold annual NSA meets and India as lead country for BIMSTEC security matters decided to host the inaugural session, officials told ET.
NSAAjit Dovalwill be joined by his counterparts from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan: They will seek to establish a concrete action plan to contain terror in the region and emphasise on greater synergy in intelligence sharing among the seven countries, officials hinted.
The meeting of BIMSTEC senior officials in Kathmandu last month had decided to convene the NSA conference at the earliest, and this meeting will give leaders the perfect opportunity to deal holistically with security issues. A key objective behind this exercise is to create a common security space among BIMSTEC nations which face similar traditional and non-traditional security threats.
Topics on the meeting agenda include drug-trafficking and crossborder crime, besides the issue of protecting the Bay of Bengal zone.
This meet of security chiefs will provide inputs for the fourth BIMSTEC summit in the last quarter of 2017 in Nepal, coinciding with the 20th year of formation of the grouping. The security chiefs will also discuss the present status of the proposed BIMSTEC counter-terror convention as well as the BIMSTEC MutualLegal Assistance Treaty mechanism, hinted persons familiar with the development.
"There is unanimity among members of BIMSTEC that safeguarding the region is imperative for economic growth and this exercise of the NSA meet would contribute toward that objective," an official said. India has effective bilateral counter-terror cooperation with all members of BIMSTEC. An international de-radicalisation meet led by India is also in pipeline this year.
The BIMSTEC declaration in Goa last October had stressed: "We reiterate our strong commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and stress that there can be no justification for acts of terror on any grounds whatsoever."

Police arrest motorcycle snatch thief duo after high speed chase
Two motorcycle snatch and grab thieves were nabbed yesterday morning after a police high-speed chase from Chilaw to Puttalam. Police shot a suspect in the knee at Battulu-oya Bridge during the chase.
The suspects kept on riding despite being wounded. The ride ended when the motorcycle fell over at the pedestrian crossing near Keeriyankaliya garment factory in Puttalam, police said.
Two police officers from Chilaw, Sergeant Mangala and Constable Adhikari, started their chase after the suspects were fleeing on their motorcycle after they had snatched a gold necklace off a female who was about to take her child to a Montessori.
Her husband too was close by on a motorcycle at the time. The incident had taken place at about 7.25 am at Arachchikattuwa in the Chilaw police division, police said. The high-speed chase began when the two officers from the Chilaw police, on field duty on the road, came to learn about the theft from the womans husband and several residents in the area.
Closing in on the suspects during the chase, the police officers had signaled the suspects to pull their motorcycle over, but they refused to follow the police order repeatedly. As the suspects were fleeing the crime scene, the officers were forced to fire shots below the knee as the suspects were determined on getting away, Chilaw Police SP Kumarapeli said.
They did not stop even after being shot at by the police, he said. When their motorcycle crashed on the road at Keeriyankalliya, Puttalam, it had hit a woman. Fortunately, she did not suffer any serious injury, he said. The suspects were taken to the Chilaw Base Hospital. Chilaw Police HQI said they have started inquiries into multiple snatch and grab thefts in Chilaw.

Restoration of Jesus' tomb completed in time for Easter

Just in time for Easter, a Greek restoration team hascompleted a historic renovation of the Edicule, the shrine that tradition says houses the cave where Jesus was buried and rose to heaven.
Gone is the unsightly iron cage built around the shrine by British authorities in 1947 to shore up the walls. Gone is the black soot on the shrine's stone facade from decades of pilgrims lighting candles. And goneare fears about the stability of the old shrine, which hadn't been restored in more than 200 years.
"If this intervention hadn't happened now, there is a very great risk that there could have been a collapse," Bonnie Burnham of the World Monuments Fund said. "This is a complete transformation of the monument."
The fund provided an initial $1.4 million (1.1 million) for the $4 million restoration, thanks to a donation by the widow of the founder of Atlantic Records. Jordan's King Abdullah II and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also chipped in about 150,000 euros each, along with other private and church donations, Burnham said.
The limestone and marble structure stands at the center of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, one of the world's oldest churches - a 12th-century building standing on 4th-century remains. The shrine needed urgent attention after years of exposure to environmental factors like water, humidity and candle smoke.
Three main Christian denominations jealously guard separate sections of the church, but they put aside their longstanding religious rivalries to give their blessing for the restoration. In 2015, Israeli police briefly shut down the building after Israel's Antiquities Authority deemed it unsafe, and repairs began in June 2016.
Arestoration team from the National Technical University of Athens stripped the stone slabs from the shrine's faade and patched up the internal masonry of the shrine, injecting it with tubes of grout for reinforcement. Each stone slab was cleaned of candle soot and pigeon droppings, then put back in place. Titanium bolts were inserted into the structure for reinforcement, and frescos and the shrine's painted dome were given a face-lift.
The restorers also made some discoveries.
On October 26, the team entered the inner sanctum of the shrine, the burial chamber of Jesus, and temporarily slid open an old marble layer covering the bedrock where Jesus' body is said to have been placed.
Below the outer marble layer was a white rose marble slab engraved with a cross, which the team dated to the late Crusader period of the 14th century. Beneath that marble slab was an even older, grey marble slab protecting the bedrock, and mortar on the slab dates to the 4th century, when Roman Emperor Constantine ordered the Church of the Holy Sepulcher built.
The restorers have cut a small window from the shrine's marble walls for pilgrims to see - for the first time - the bare stone of the ancient burial cave.
"It seems we are in front of levels of history that are validated," said Antonia Moropoulou, who supervised the renovation.
The team is dismantling its worksite ahead of a ceremony Wednesday to mark the completion of the renovation, in the presence of two representatives of dueling Christian denominations - Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, who is the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, and a representative of Pope Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church.
Concern for the church's stability has brought Christian denominations together, and Moropoulou hopes it ushers in a "new era" of cooperation. She hopes the communities will make some changes in longstanding customs inside the church, like pilgrims smashing their lit candles onto the Edicule's stone wall, so the structure is not compromised.
Now, money is being raised for another round of restorations - consolidating drainage and sewage pipes underground, around the tomb, to stabilize its foundations - so renovations won't be needed for years to come.
"Here is a monument that has been worshipped through the centuries, and will be worshipped forever," said Moropoulou.

Rihanna to star opposite Adam Driver in music drama Annette
Rihanna has landed yet another movie project - starring opposite Adam Driver in music drama Annette.
The 29-year-old singer is expanding her film resume with a series of impressive movie roles, including the upcoming Oceans Eight opposite Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter.
Adam Driver is also busy making his cinematic mark, after rising to fame on Lena Dunhams TV drama Girls before being cast as Kylo Ren in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
Now Rihanna and Adam are joining forces for Annette - the first English-language movie from legendary French director Leos Carax.
Further details of the pairs roles in the film have yet to be revealed but Variety reports that while Rihannas involvement had been rumoured in the project, it has now been confirmed.
Rooney Mara was another name linked to the film but has pulled out due to clashing commitments. Bosses are now said to be looking for a new actress to take on the other female lead role.
The script for Annette has been written by Sparks, the rock band founded by Ron and Russell Mael in 1971, with the group also penning original songs for the movie. Shooting on the film will begin this spring in a variety of locations, including Los Angeles. Rihanna has since lent her voice to animated movie Home as well as starring in hit TV show Bates Motel.

The Outstanding Achievement Award of the Rotary District 3220 was presentedto Dr. Ajith C. S. Perera, at the annual Conference 2017 of the Rotary District 3220 in at the BMICH in Colombo.
Rtn. Barry Rassing - a trustee of the Rotary Foundation - representing the President of Rotary International Rtn. John F. Germ, was the Chief Guest at this event.
The award was made in recognition and appreciation of his contributions to bringing lasting change in the community, undeterred by his personal adversity, playing eight different roles voluntarily over 17 consecutive yearsto promote Accessibility Rights,focusing on enhancement of the quality of daily life of people of all abilities.
A large wayside tree crashed on Pereras moving car in November 1992, leaving him instantaneously a paraplegic for life.
But he turned this misfortune into a crusade for the disadvantaged, to be an outstanding achiever serving humanity with lasting impact to his best ability.
He has contributed significantly to improving many unknown human lives, in keeping with Rotary Serving Humanity.
His successful challenge to the Government in the Supreme Court achieved a landmark order in April 2011 requiring access to buildings the public needs to use in daily life.
Last year, Sri Lanka ratified the International Human Rights Treaty of the United Nations (CRPD) to protect the rights and dignity of persons with restricted ability and ensure that they enjoy full equality under the law.
Implementation of the CRPD is also necessary for Sri Lanka to win back GSP Plus.

Sarath Wimalaratne, T.D. Rajapakse Ananda heroes of yesteryear
I had the opportunity to interview two stalwarts of Ananda cricket in the early fifties namely Sarath Wimalaratne and T.D. Rajapakse.
Wimalaratne was the first to open up the interview still showing his strong personality traits although T.D. Rajapakse remained strong and silent in the background.
The famous coach late P.W.Perera spotted his talent whilst Sarath was having a net at under 16 practices, and decided that Sarath should play in the forthcoming 1st eleven match against S Thomas'. Sarath was dumbstruck, since he did not even have a pair of longs, and he had to pay a belated visit to a shop at Paranavadiya to get two pairs of white longs stitched for his big occasion. Sarath recalls that Denis Ferdinands, a Thomian pace bowler of no mean repute was the one he had to face first up when he went to bat at no 9. Ferdinands had one look at Sarath and must have felt sorry for the little guy who was barely taller than the bat he was holding, the result was a donkey drop which Sarath dispatched to the square leg fence with consummate ease. The rest of the deliveries were directed at him at red hot pace and he ducked and weaved to survive the over. This was his baptism in first eleven cricket and the guts he possessed was there for all to see. From there on Sarath blended into the team nicely and shone for four years.
It is interesting to note how Sarath became a tear away fast bowler after bowling gentle off spin. Sarath recalls that during a match between Colombo South and North, late Yatagama Amaradasa the Colombo North captain wanted to change ends of his fast bowlers, namely L.R. Gunatilake and L.C.R. Wijesinghe, (the Wesley pace duo) and Sarath was given the ball to change ends and he took two wickets bowling at brisk medium in the first over itself and from then on he bowled unchanged to bag 8 for 23.
Sarath began to open bowling and batting for Ananda and his batting partner was none other than Dharmasiri (Tikka) de Silva who was an excellent gully fielder and a quick runner between the wickets. Those days we used to call him roller skates Silva. Sarath himself was the 100 yards champion at Ananda and this combination was so quick that they hatched a plan against a Dharmaraja pace bowler, who was quick as lightning and the keeper used to stand a few yards in front of the boundary line. What they decided was to take a single before it reached the keeper and two for a fumble.I was a witness to this too watching this match at Campbell Place and it was quite hilarious.
Sarath was crowned as the Schoolboy Cricketer in 1962. He joined Medical College in 1965 and played till 1969, captaining the last two years, which according to Sarath is a record.
In a Gopalan Trophy match, Wimalaratne bagged 10 wickets and was awarded The Man of The Match. It is a pity that I have to curtail more of Wimalaratnes cricketing feats due to space confinements.
Changing lanes, and shifting my focus to our other hero, T.D. Rajapakse, who was built like a rock. His baritone voice at times was hardly audible.
T.D., after school played for Bloomfield in 1963, and they won the Sara Trophy, he subsequently joined the Army and captained for 4 years. Rajapakse and W.W. Fernando had the highest partnership in first class cricket of 478 runs, at the time. This was at a Gopalan Trophy match, which was recorded in Wisden of 1977. T.D. scored 245 and W.W. Fernando 222. This record was broken by Sanath Jayasuriya and Roshan Mahanama later at Kettarama.
In 1961 West Indians of the caliber of Sir Garfield Sobers, Rohan Kanhai, Conrad Hunte and Wesley Hall represented the Mirror eleven and three Anandians namely Amaradasa, late Sonny Yatawara and T.D. Rajapakse had the honour of playing with those greats.
When inquired about the message they could give to young cricketers, they unanimously agreed that the weakest links in our present cricketers were fielding and running between the wickets. They mentioned that they used to practice running between the wickets, and knew in their heads where all the ten fielders and what their capabilities were. Lapses in concentration in the slips were also highlighted.
I also personally feel that our cricketers have a problem; they just cannot concentrate for long periods, and they lack agility in running between the wickets and in fielding. This I feel is essential in cricket and should be drilled onto the youngsters at a young age like they do in countries who are ruling the roost at present in cricket.

Savour the flavor of the French cuisine : Bon apptit!
March 21 will be a night to remember, make no mistake! One of the similarities people around the world share is an appetite for delicious food. It is one of the many gifts of life that make life worth living. On March 21, 2000 Chefs over five continents will prepare 2000 menus inspired by French Cuisine. Daily News visited Ambassador of France to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Jean Marin Schuh residence and was briefed on the Good France event which will be held simultaneously all over the world.
Ambassador of France Jean Marin Schuh addressing the gathering
Good France is a worldwide event coordinated by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to showcase French Cuisine. With this event in Sri Lanka we want to honor French Cuisine - its excellence and its values.
The Gout de France/ Good France event unites chefs from all horizons and from around the world on the same evening, with one shared goal  Celebrating the excellence and creativity of French Gastronomy, said French Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Jean Marin Schuh.
This is actually the result of a massive operation. Restaurants were invited to propose a menu that respects French Culinary tradition. An international committee of Chefs then approved the list of participating Chefs
Following the great success of the two first events, we decided to repeat the experience in 2017 in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, stated Schuh
The momentum has really picked up! Chefs around the world are now in their elements getting ready for the big day. In the first event 100,000 guests enjoyed a French Dinner in over 1,300 restaurants (85 percent abroad) and 150 embassies around the world.
This year in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, six restaurants are participating. Three in Colombo  Galle Face Hotel, Waters Edge and Taj Samudra. Two in Kandy  Leopard d argent and OZO and one in Male  Taj Exotica Resort & Spa Maldives.
Gastronomy is part of Frances heritage and our identity, as was demonstrated by UNESCO in 2010 when it incorporated the Gastronomic meal of the French into the intangible cultural heritage of humanity. Gastronomy contributes significantly to our countrys image abroad and to our attractiveness, with almost a third of foreign tourist visitors saying that our food and wine was what most drew them to us, explained Schuh.
This will be the mother of all dinners! A global consciousness. In the first event French Embassies abroad hosted some 5000 guests.
Our Gastronomy is a pillar of our heritage and a remarkable ambassador for France, and should be therefore defended, supported and promoted. In Sri Lanka this year, restaurants and chefs showed a great interest for the event. I am proud to welcome them on board this exciting adventure, added Schuh.

In service of the people : Sri Lanka Police celebrate Heroes Day
The Sri Lanka Police held its 150th anniversary celebrations on September 3, 2016. But this year it celebrates its 153rd anniversary.
Two years after the official launching of the police service as an organisation police constable Sahan heroically laid down his life during an operation launched to arrest well known bandit Saradiel and his robber gang at Uthuwankanda in Mawanella on March 21, 1864 to a gunshot fired by Saradiel's colleague Mammale Marikkar.
Based on this incident, Police Heroes Day is observed on March 21 every year.
This year's Police Heroes Day celebrations will be held at the main heroes memorial at the Bambalapitiya Police Field Force Headquarters under the patronage of IGP Pujith Senadhibandara Jayasundara.
Commemorative ceremonies will also be held at the Constable Sahan memorial at Mawanella and the police heroes memorial erected at Rupaskulam, Ampara where a batch of 400 policemen heroically laid down their lives on June 11, 1990.
Sacrificing life in defence of the freedom and safety of fellow men is the greatest deed an individual could perform in ones lifetime.
Today we are commemorating such a great deed performed by our heroes.
From the day Constable Sahan laid down his life a total of 3,111 police men and women have laid down their lives in defence of the motherland to date.
During the war against terrorism 2,594 police men and women laid down their lives in defence of the motherland and all Sri Lankans enjoying freedom today commemorate them with great honour today.
We should also remember that another 639 police men and women have become disabled by sacrificing their future in defence of the motherland.
IGP Pujith Jayasundara had paid special attention towards the welfare of police heroes. Accordingly, the following steps are to be taken to cater to their welfare.
All allowances paid to police officers disabled during the war have been equally extended to officers disabled during normal duties involved in maintaining law and order.
* Granting pension entitlements to officers sent on retirement due to disabilities caused during normal duties even if they had not completed 10 years service.
* Construction of houses for families of police heroes at the Meerigama Walbothale Police war heroes village.
* Granting priority for dependents of police heroes at the Police Hospital.
Meanwhile, welfare activities already in operation are as follows:
* Provision of housing assistance to police heroes and their families and dependents through the Police Seva Vanitha unit.
* Granting of scholarships to children of police heroes families for school and university education.
* Medical assistance in respect of acute illness.
* Delivery of parcel of dry food rations to the dependents of dead police heroes at their door steps annually for the Sinhala and Hindu New Year.
* Issuing 'Wirusara' cards to disabled officers and dependents of departed heroes to qualify them for special privileges from 43 designated institutions.
* Granting of interest free loans to police heroes and their dependents for house building and in respect of higher education by the Police Families Welfare Society.
Throughout its 150 year long journey, the Sri Lanka Police has performed the challenge of ensuring peace and security for the people of Sri Lanka in a fearless and unremitting manner.
A grateful nation thankfully remember police heroes with honour and pride for their selfless service.

SF suspects special unit targeted Journalists
Quoting a statement made by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka on Wickrematunges killing, the CID informed the Mt. Lavinia Magistrates Court yesterday that Fonseka had harboured suspicions that a special unit carried out attacks on Wickrematunge, including on the media.
The unit allegedly operated under the former Head of the Intelligence Services, Kapila Hendawitharana. The CID informed court that it had recorded a statement from the former Army Commander Field Marshal Fonseka on the killing of the late Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge and the Field Marshal had told them that he had suspicions about a special unit operating under Hendawitharana to carry out certain attacks in the Colombo area.
Fonseka had also said he was not aware of the security situation in the Colombo area at the time as it was handled not by him but by a Major General.
Citing the latest findings in its probe on the Wickrematunge killing, CID Inspector Nishantha Silva said former Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge had died due to an assault on his head by an unidentified sharp instrument and not by shooting.
Lasantha Wickrematunge was widely thought to have died from a shooting that took place on his way to work on January 8, 2009.
Nishantha Silva also said when examining evidence of the murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge, it had identified five phones that were utilized for internal communication among members of the gang suspected of the murder.
Investigations had revealed that the phones were used near Upali Tennakoons residence in Imbulgoda and in the vicinity of the Rivira Media Corporation to which both Upali Tennakone and Keith Noyahr were attached.
According to the CID, four out of the five mobile phones had been purchased from the same location - a private business institution.
Lasantha Wickrematunge, the Chief Editor of the English weekly, The Sunday Leader, was assassinated on January 8, 2009 by unidentified assailants on Attidiya - Mt. Lavinia Road, Colombo.

Shelton considers The Voice proposal as a joke
Blake Shelton has joked about proposing to girlfriend Gwen Stefani on TV show The Voice.
The country star has dismissed rampant rumours suggesting he is planning to get down on one knee on live television, but hes still having fun with the romantic idea.
During newly released outtakes from the set of the U.S. talent show, he responded to fellow judge Alicia Keys when she casually suggested a proposal on the show would be good for ratings.
Would that make you feel weird, Gwen Shelton asked his girlfriend, to which Stefani laughs, That would be my dream come true!
The couple started dating after meeting on the show in late 2015, following their subsequent marriage splits. Blake divorced fellow country star Miranda Lambert the previous summer and Gwen was estranged from her now ex-husband Gavin Rossdale.
Meanwhile, amid all the fun and games on The Voice, Blake has been hit with some sad news - a young fan who lit up the Internet with her version of her heros Saviors Shadow has been declared brain-dead after surgery.
The singer sent prayers to little Brooke Haire after catching her performance online and learning she was heading into surgery.
Brooke you are an angel!! he wrote on Twitter on Wednesday night (15Mar17). Im honored you sang my song... We are all keeping you in our prayers.
Ironically, Brookes last wish before she went in for surgery was for Shelton to see her performance video, which was filmed earlier this month (Mar17), according to the Facebook page set up for her.

Shop till you drop laughing non-stop!
People sometimes ask me where I find the material for my satire columns. And I tell them that they dont have to look far. Because you will soon realise that there is humour everywhere. It is there in most given situations, even in the seemingly mundane.
So the best way to start is to begin observing the simple things in everyday life. It is easier to deal with the uncomplicated happenings in customary life while studying closely the foibles and idiosyncrasies of people around you. While doing so it would be a good thing to look inwards and so identify and laugh at your own quirks.
For instance I have found supermarkets and shopping emporiums some of the most creatively stimulating places stocked with goodies and fashion accessories as well as stacks of humour.
What I mean is, if you cultivate a sense of awareness, these places with their myriad colours and smells often provide you with inspiration around virtually every corner. And taking the kids along may prove costly, but would be certain to provide a double bonus in terms of adding to your humour depository.
To me they are not just humdrum retail places, they are an exciting experience, even if you are on a mission of routine grocery shopping. Most men hate any kind of shopping and do their darndest to avoid it. But I dont mind it too much unless it eats into the priceless time of my cocktail hour. Ok, so while engaged in such expeditions I call it research. I study shoppers and shop staff in the same manner that anthropologists observe their subjects in their natural habitats.
Some of the retail places both locally and overseas provide you with great data for humour writing research even if it is at your own expense. Once in Oregon I was running late to fetch some thirst-slakers for a party and as soon as I reached the counter the elderly cashier lady was on the phone.
I told her as politely as I could: "Excuse me, maam I'm in a hurry. Could you check me out, please" The gray-haired cashier turned around with a twinkle in her eye. She then looked me up and down, smiled and said: "Not bad!"
I always read out the riot act to the kids before sallying forth on a grocery mission. It goes like this: "Now here are the rules guys: Do not ask me for anything. I will decide on what treats you get because I know your preferences. Do not poke at the papayas just to see if your finger goes through them. And if it does happen accidentally don't lick your fingers. Simply have the fruit weighed and put it in our cart.
"Do not test the laws of physics and try to take out the bottom can in the pyramid shaped display of instant soups or whatever other product. Do not play catch with oranges in the produce section. And no Grand Prix racing stuff down the aisles in separate carts. Understood"
Then in Hong Kong my wife was standing in a grocery queue with our grand-daughter Dinisha, then three, riding in the baby seat of the grocery cart.
A Sikh gentleman with a turban was in front of them. Dinisha looking on in amazement blurted: Look Mum-Mum that man has forgotten to take his towel off after his shower!
Now the bogey man for generations in our family, conjured up by yours truly, is an imaginary giant called Bull McCorby. Grandson Kingsley was only four when a rude, hulking slob of a man cut in with his trolley and pushed past his aunt and his sister at the cash point. Kingsley, the feisty firebrand pulled at the queue-jumpers trouser leg.
While the offender towered over him with a menacing glare, Kingco addressed him fearlessly: I dont care if you are Bull McCorby! I think you are a big bully! His aunt tried to shush him but Kingco was sticking to his guns like a frontier lawman. He turned towards the family and said: I think he is rude. Just because he is hungry and cant wait to fill his big bundy he should not be allowed to push people. And why is everyone here coughing
It was a David and Goliath standoff and the lumbering Goliath eventually backed off. He carefully put his trolley in reverse and pushed it to the furthest checkout counter as our tiny hero called out mockingly after him: And look where you are walking. And get to the back of the line! There were appreciative chuckles all around and he was rewarded with treats from the shoppers around.
I really believe women should dress decently, at least in public that is. Just the other day, a woman with a skimpy skirt walked jauntily down the aisles of a big supermarket. Her nether garment was so scanty it was almost invisible and covered by her blouse.
A little girl trotting beside her mother exclaimed: Ammie! That lady forgot her trousers! Her mother trying hard not to laugh: Yes dear, yes she did! But not so loud.
Now I must say that the toddler seats in our local supermarket carts are hardly baby-proof. They are downright dangerous. The little ones I have placed in them are far more precocious than any trolley designer could bargain for. Time and again I have caught a toddler playing Houdini and manoeuvring his little body out of his seat in an attempt to stand up.
I am amazed that the little bounder and others of his contortionist ilk have made it to their second birthdays without suffering brain damaging head injuries. And always ask the kids to keep their observations to themselves and voice them in the car after the shopping is done. I had to shush my little grandson Kingsley when he was around four at checkout counter.
He looked into the shopping trolley of a bald-as billiard- ball old coot directly in front of us. He turned to me with twinkling eyes and muttered in a loud whisper: "What the heck is he buying shampoo for He's bald!"
I was shopping in a large London emporium once where kids were dashing around all over the place. Suddenly, everyone stood checkmated with curiosity as a tiny voice an aisle or two away started calling: Mummy, this lady doesnt have any panties on! Mummy! This lady doesnt have any paaaaanties ! Everyone followed the voice and found her as fast as they could. She was looking under the dress of a manikin. Other shoppers had stopped and turned to watch with amusement.
When grandson Rex Tharindu was three he wanted some popcorn while we walked down a crowded Brisbane mall. When he spotted the nut stall he decided to run all the way up to it shouting at the top of his little voice: C* ckporn, c*ckporn! He was obviously mixing up his letters a bit. But I stood there red faced while the laughter echoed around my burning ears.
So who says shopping is a drag

Sichuan Province trade grows  with direct flights to Chengdu
Sri Lanka Sichuan Province China trade is growing and this must be further increased Sichuan International Chamber Vice President Zhou Yichuan said in Colombo yesterday.
Speaking at the Sri Lanka Sichuan Business Matching Session 2017 he said trade volumes between Sichuan and South Asian countries reached USD 1.357 billion in 2015. For Sichuan and Sri Lanka, the total volume was USD 37.42 million.
In spite of small share of the total trade, we have cooperation in agriculture, food, tourism, infrastructure, etc. In early 2015, Chengdu opened a direct flight to Colombo, thus providing a favorable condition for business cooperation, he added.
CCPIT Sichuan Council will strengthen cooperation in infrastructure building, trade transfer and tourism with Sri Lanka by South Asia Round Table Conference and encourage more Sichuan companies to carry out investment and trade cooperation in Sri Lanka. Moreover, we will hold 2017 Chengdu International Trade Fair for the Automotive and Aftermarket Services, 2017 China (Chengdu) Smart Industry International Expo and we invite Sri Lankan chambers, associations, companies to come for this fairs and expand market in Sichuan and beyond.

## Title: Significant real estate  opportunities in Tier II cities

Significant real estate  opportunities in Tier II cities
Since the civil war ended over seven years ago, Sri Lanka has rapidly become a hotspot for investment among emerging markets.
The booming property market in the island has become popular with those looking to invest in property. Considering the economic growth prospects of the country, real estate investment opportunities have also increased over the last few years and the trend is expected to continue in the future.
Interestingly cities across the country have also witnessed strong economic growth in the past few years, primarily on account of national level economic policies, improvements in infrastructure and the level of political stability.
When it comes to classifying cities in Sri Lanka in terms of business, real estate and commercialisation, we hear a lot about Tier I and Tier II. As Tier I cities are highly commercialised metropolises, people still wonder what exactly Tier II cities are then. In the simplest perspective, Tier II cities are emerging cities which have the potential to be a Tier I city in the future.
Although Tier I cities witnesses the bulk of development, the issue with Tier I cities is that when it comes to economic boom and investment, they are inundated with growing investments in the industrial and service sectors along with the boom of large-scale investments in the real estate sector. Many developers tend to focus on these cities in order to realize ROI's faster. On the other hand, as a result of all the development and commercialization the cost of real estate also increases significantly making it unaffordable to the majority of the middle-class population.
However, Tier II cities are in the process of developing both in terms of real estate and commercial opportunities. These cities tend to be up-and-coming and many companies and people tend to invest even though they haven't yet reached their peak. Real estate is usually relatively inexpensive here; however, if growth continues, prices will no doubt rise.
Tier II cities are part of the country's growth and whose progress can help modernize suburban Sri Lanka to a Megalopolis whilst in the process contribute significantly to the overall development of the country.
The Government of Sri Lanka have initiated the creation of master plans for most of these cities and therefore, it would create a number of real estate development opportunities both in the short and long term.
Paramount Realty recognizes the present opportunity for growth and development in Tier II cities and believes that these cities provide significant opportunities for developers and investors.
Inspired by a vision to be the market leader in providing innovative real estate solutions, Paramount is focused on bringing the affordable living concept to these emerging cities whilst ensuring stakeholder returns.
The real estate market in Sri Lanka is no doubt growing rapidly and it is every person's dream to live in a comfortable and cozy home with all the modern amenities. Paramount is taking up this challenge to invest in such cities because these cities promise great potential due to the basic infrastructure, availability of land (at lower price points), emerging demographic/psychographic profiles, greener environment and overall GDP growth.

SL, Russia mark 60 years: Six decades of all-weather friendship
As Sri Lanka and Russia celebrate 60 years since establishing diplomatic relations, this year, the Daily News met with Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Dr. Saman Weerasinghe to discuss the economic and political relationship between the two countries. The relationship, which strengthened during the days of the non-alignment movement, has come a long way, and while the number of dominant players in the international stage has increased since then, Dr. Weerasinghe trusts that we could still do more to further strengthen ties with Russia, which has been an all-weather friend to Sri Lanka over the years.
Excerpts follow:
Q. In 1958, two years after Russia and Sri Lanka established diplomatic relations, the two governments signed an agreement on economic and technical cooperation. The Cabinet recently approved a proposal to sign another agreement with Russia on science, technology, and innovation during President Maithripala Sirisena's visit to Russia this month. Over the last 60 years, how has this partnership helped improve the field of technology in Sri Lanka And especially when we are trying to expand into the field of electronic exports, how can Russia assist us improve our technology
A. The Agreement on Economic and Technical Co-operation, which had existed between the two countries, was replaced by a proposal made by the Sri Lankan side on co-operation in the trade sector in the year 1998. Since then, Sri Lanka has been negotiating with the Russian Federation in the framework of the same topic, and finally, the both parties came into consensus and established the Inter-governmental Joint Commission on Trade and Economic Corporation and Science and Technology Corporation in 2015. After my appointment as the new Ambassador to the Russian Federation, the first session of this Commission was held in February, last year, in Moscow.
This is one of the most significant milestones for our country in terms of expansion of technological relations with Russia. In the framework of activities implemented by the above Commission, the Secretary of the Ministry of Science and Technology of Sri Lanka had further discussions and agreed to consider several collaborations with the Russian counterpart.
You may see that now we are signing an MoU between the ministries of both countries on co-operation in science, technology, and innovation during the official visit of the President, and it covers areas such as exchange of scientists and specialists, scientific and technological information, etc. Minister Susil Premajayantha will be a member of the official Sri Lankan delegation to sign this Memorandum on behalf of the Sri Lankan side.
In addition, a delegation from the Arthur C. Clark Institute of Modern Technologies, Katubedda, will visit Russia parallel to the visit of the President for discussions and singing of an MoU with the State Space Corporation of the Russian Federation (ROSCOSMOS) and visiting the Samara State Aerospace University for further enhancement of technological co-operation between our countries.
Plus, for the last few years, top Russian technological universities, among which is the Bauman State Technical University and St. Petersburg State Polytechnic University, have been providing education in the areas of aircraft engineering, nano technology, mechatronics, etc. to students from Sri Lanka.
I think all these activities implemented by both, Sri Lanka and Russia, clearly explain what kind of relations our countries have in the areas of science and technology, and I am absolutely certain that the near future will bring us even more positive outcomes of this co-operation.
Q. What other areas do you hope to cover during the President's visit
A. Russia is a country which we are having a strong and cordial relationship with. We wish to cover all possible areas of co-operation, including political and economic relations, trade and defence.This year, we are celebrating 60 years of diplomatic relations between our countries and, without a doubt, we have come through a long period, so obviously we have a long history to discuss. And we will.
In addition to the MoU on co-operation in science, technology, and innovation, we are in the process of finalizing policy documents and agreements on the areas covering cultural relations, tourism, and fisheries. Signing of these documents will enable us to enhance co-operation in these spheres, which for sure can bring very fruitful results.
Concerning the sector of fisheries, the document has a status of a Federal Agreement which covers the areas of technological improvement, research, and skill development, addresses marine related conservation activities and policies, etc.
Q. Russia, last year, expressed interest in further improving relations with Sri Lanka through bi-lateral ties. What are the areas you are looking at for further co-operation, and how can more Russian investments be brought into Sri Lanka The Cabinet also approved many agreements to be signed with Russia. How can this be used to expand on and build new business ties
A. Sri Lanka is currently in the process of negotiations of an agreement on the topic related to investments. Up to date, Russia has not yet signed any agreement with Sri Lanka.
However, as an initiation, we have organized a seminar with the support of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation for incoming business delegation, covering such sectors as tea, tourism, trade, construction, and logistics etc.
We expect more than 40 representatives of the Russian business and investment industries. Moreover, Chairman of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Upul Jayasuriya is expected to deliver a comprehensive presentation on Sri Lanka and its investment potentials and the benefits to the audience.
Q. There is a possibility of US ending sanctions on Russia, and thus, it is expected that the Russian economy would have a boost as a result. How will this help improve Sri Lankan exports to Russia, especially in the areas like tea, where Sri Lanka holds close to 17 percent of the market
A. To my knowledge, the US sanctions have not made significant impact on the Russian economy. In fact, the Russian economy is mainly hit by lower global oil prices, as a large portion of foreign exchange income of the country is generated by oil and gas exports.
We should not forget that not only Russia, but also the global economy is going through an economic slowdown. The repercussions of this global economic meltdown also reflect in the Russian economy.
As I know, the present on-going dialogue and relationship between the US and Russia is on the eradication of world terrorism. However, it can be anticipated that a positive movement of the US-Russia relationship would bring desirable outcomes for Russia in future.
If I talk about the Sri Lanka tea exports to Russia, the current economic situation in the Russian Federation under pressure from declining oil and gas prices and continuous depreciation of Ruble against USD is severely affecting the Sri Lanka tea export to Russia. From the 2014 to 2016, the Sri Lanka tea exports to the Russian Federation declined by 25 percent in value term. Sri Lanka is the largest tea exporter to Russia with market share of 28 percent in value term by 2016.
However, our Ceylon tea market share in the Russian tea market has declined from 38 percent in 2014 to 28 percent in 2016, under the weakening economic condition attributed to the lower global oil prices.
Given the circumstances, if the global oil prices were increased, it would boost the Russian economy, and the Russian Ruble would begin to be appreciated against US Dollar. With a stable economic condition, the Russian importers would be able to bring down the products from foreign countries at a lower cost, and Sri Lanka could also exploit the opportunity to export more Ceylon tea to the Russian market. In a sound economic condition in Russia, the purchasing power of the Russian people would increase, and the consumers would shift to high quality products such as pre-packed Ceylon tea. In addition, there is a very high chance that under such conditions, Ceylon tea will reinforce its position in the Russian market.
Q. As Ambassador, what are your own areas of focus, and where do you see potential for Sri Lanka
A. Since I have spent a lot of time in both, Sri Lanka and Russia, I have a very strong wish to enhance the relationship between these two countries. I have focused on the all areas, including defence, political, and economic relations. I have seen that the trade between two countries is not up to the expectations, and during my tenure, I have taken measures to initiate these improvements.
As a result, we have started to participate in international trade, tourism, food exhibitions, and now, are able to diversify our export basket from tea, into seafood, spices, confectionery, etc.
For the first time after a decade, we have started promoting gems and jewellery in the Russian Federation, and had a delegation of top precious stone exporters come to the Russian Federation. They also held a networking session for them to build their contacts in prospective business opportunities.
Seafood exports to the Russian Federation has surpassed USD 1.3 million for the last year. The embassy conducted a seafood demonstration programme for top seafood exporters exhibited in Russia in 2015, and had a significant impact on this increase.
Apart from this, there is a potential for apparel products to be exported to the Russian Federation, and we are looking forward to seeing signs of enhancement in this sector as well.
Q. Do you think the reputation of the Sri Lankan Embassy in Russia and its relationship with Russia has been tarnished due to the alleged actions of former Ambassador to Russia UdayangaWeeratunga
A. This is a topic under the discussion of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka. Therefore, I would rather not comment on this question.
Q. What steps have been taken to apprehend him Has Interpol reached out to the Embassy
A. No.
Q. In the last 60 years, more after the 70s, we have seen Russian influence over Sri Lankan foreign policy wane as other powers such as US, China, and India are coming into the fore. How does this impact relations between the two countries
A. Sri Lankas foreign policy is based on the principle friendly towards all enmity to the world. This is an honest open foreign policy for all the countries in the world.This is exactly what the Russian Federation and Sri Lanka have had for last several decades, and we are expecting to keep the same cordial relationship with Russia in the future, and I believe that visits like this (visit of the President of Sri Lanka to Russia) would warm up the relationships between our countries with very prospective bilateral outcomes as a result in future.
Q. With the UN Human Rights Council deliberating on Resolution 30/1 to be co-sponsored by Sri Lanka, along with the UK and USA, how can Russia help support Sri Lanka on the international stage
A. Like in the past, Sri Lanka is always grateful to Russia for the consistent support extended by the Russian Government in multilateral fora.
Q. How has Russia's foreign policy changed since Donald Trump was sworn in as President, and what role do developing countries such as ours have to play, and does it benefit us or not
A. I believe that we should positively think about political changes in the USA and hope that the conducive policies will come into effect as a result, which will be beneficial for all countries.

Sports and sportsmanship
March is when the press refers to Big Match madness every year. Match commissioners have been sent to watch over matches by the Education Ministry. The article today refers to facets of extraordinary sportsmanship, behaviour of spectators worthy of emulation and the role of technology in consolidating the integrity of decisions by match officials. This not a piece which either targets individual acts or a particular institution nor are they life threatening utterances written by an enthusiast of sports!
When are players truly free to be Sportsmen Could it be when players are not under pressure to win at all cost including physically taking out their opponents, a coach will not loose his or her job for not producing winning results, parental pressure to play their sons or daughters does not influence team selection, match officials are fair in their interpretations, spectators do not invade or disturb play, heads of schools demand nothing less, alumni nurturing sports in their old school promote such practices, Captains and seniors set the example and Sportsmanship is celebrated including by the opposition.
Masters and coaches
MIC's, TIC's and Coaches should have the following qualities: teach student-athletes the importance of integrity, honesty, reliability and loyalty, place the academic, emotional, physical and moral wellbeing of athletes above desires and pressures to win, treat contest officials with respect, treat the parents of student-sportspersons with respect; do not engage in or permit profanity or obscene gestures, use positive coaching methods to make the experience enjoyable, increase self-esteem and foster a love and appreciation for the sport, respect proper teacher-student boundaries, teach positive life skills, advocate, vigorously advocate the concept of pursuing victory with honour in all communications, be a worthy role-model, maintain a sports environment that is physically and emotionally safe, put safety and health considerations above the desire to win, Honour the spirit of the rules, promote sportsmanship.
Administrators should respect the right of others to be treated with dignity, strive to improve efficiency, create an atmosphere, which encourages fair play, display a high standard of behavior, promote a positive image to all, promote and develop the game by sharing knowledge and experience.
Coaches
Its a tough job being a coach. How many can afford to employ coaches How do coaches upgrade their skills Do they have resources to do so Our current Minister Dayasiri Jayasekare at a function spelt out his vision of standardizing a system which recognizes and grades coaches. Can sports survive without coaches at all levels A coach comes under pressure very often to produce results. There are though examples where a Head of school would explicitly inform the coach that the priority is to help children enjoy attending practices, all are afforded an opportunity to play and enhancing skill levels is important.
Celebrating sportsmanship
The recently concluding three day and the one day thereafter between Royal and S. Thomas displayed on field camaraderie of extraordinary levels. A good performance with the bat by the opponent was acknowledged by both teams on every occasion. Both captains and players seemed free to do so. Its my impression the respective heads subscribe to this ethos of play. Repition in years to follow will help turn it into an infectious habit.
I was told when the Thomian opener got out caught to a stroke which if it had carried the ball over the ropes for a six would have brought up his hundred, the fielder who caught him had held head no sooner he caught the ball for getting his opponent out at the one day match ! A truly remarkable act of sportsmanship which must be celebrated. This infectious habit was evidently seen off field with last year's cricket captains joining hands physically cheering their schools together with one on crutches!
Technology
The extent to which technology assists match officials it makes their tasks easier. In cricket, cameras are required to stay focused all the time on specific physical locations. It requires a rock steady platform which captures the movements of players against specific lines or at its best can show interpretation of sounds in relation to the position of the bat as the ball passes. The latter requires quite some technology and is expensive. While camera equipment is expensive one can search for options which make costs tolerable. The facility when afforded to match officials provides a quantum leap for tools in decision making and adds to the integrity of the sport. In tightly contested situations it becomes invaluable.
Spectators
The very name spectator means they have no business on the field of play. Sometimes spectators become tools to either disrupt contests or of a particular individual performing well. For those on the field its a huge distraction and some situations they become captives of the spectators. Crowd control in sporting events is no easy task. Its not a pure law and order matter though at times law has to be applied. Its a fine balance of maintaining public order in privately arranged public events where at times thousands maybe in attendance! Many perform thankless functions in this grey zone.
I hope this piece sheds some light on sports at schools level and the complexities involved.

Sri Lanka and Tunisia to advance economic ties
Sri Lanka has enjoyed close relations with Tunisia for years. The two countries place emphasis on developing the tourism sector, Tunisian Consul General in Colombo Mukthar Marikkar said.
The Consul General issuing a message to mark the 61st independence of Tunisia recently said Tunia is a country with more than 3000 years of history and rich cultural heritage.
The message adds: We are honoring the sacrifices by the Tunisians in the name of dignity, freedom and democracy. Sri Lanka has enjoyed a fruitful relationship with Tunisia for years.
Both countries place focus on rebuilding their tourism sectors. Tunisia enjoys free access to European Union markets with over 3,000 international organisations.
Its market is conducive to overseas entrants with investors from Sri Lanka encouraged. In 2009, Tunisia was ranked the most competitive economy in Africa and the 40th in the world by the World Economic Forum.
Tunisia emerges as the first country in the Arab world to succeed in transition to democratic rule. The leadership is determined to further enhance its relations of friendship and cooperation with Tunisias traditional partners and pledged to place Tunisias relations with emerging Asian countries among the top priorities of its foreign policy.
The past years have been marked by the participation of Sri Lankan business delegations visiting Tunis. Such visits will multiply considering the opportunities. We are confident that cooperation between our two nascent democracies has the potential to grow bigger under the new Tunisian and Sri Lankan leaderships.

Thrilled thespian
In Sri Lankan theatre, Chamika Hathlahawatta sees quite a playground. Without experiments, theatre cannot strive. That urge to experiment with theatre has posted him in some far place of the journey.
His latest try-out, Raja Man Vahala, was among the chosen productions of the 19th edition of Bharath Ranga Mahotsav, a premier national theatre festival in India. The play also bagged several awards in 2016.
We sent a DVD of the play along with an English translation of the script to the festival. But we did not hope that we would be chosen, Hathlahawatta notes.
The play was among the 32 shortlisted plays out of 600 entries.
Raja Man Vahala can offer multiple meanings in Sinhala. King, I am a slave is the surface meaning. The play is an experiment in storytelling mode, an ancient mode of entertainment long before the advent of sophisticated technology. Five storytellers appear on stage and would narrate three stories in different theatrical paths. Driven by the fascination of storytelling, Hathlahawatta went on to employ poor theatre as well as epic theatre on the local stage.
The play has drawn a good response from the audience. That was much better than we expected.
The storytellers, who make use of eight barrels on the stage, perform diverse roles including stage management, dancing, singing as well as changing costumes. This theatrical expression, though seemingly fresh to the modern audience, has been influenced by Dayananda Gunawardanas style of theatre.
Chamika Hathlahawattas interest in directing stage play originates from the research he undertook for his MPhil. His research focused on studying different styles of Sri Lankan drama. Plus, his participation in various international drama festivals has sharpened a strong sense of theatre.
We should never go on making plays in one lane. If Professor Ediriweera Sarachchandra and other notable dramatists followed only one style, our drama would not have evolved and flourished. They executed many experiments. We need to take a cue from that, Hathlahalwatta observes.
Hathlahawattas maiden stage play, Hyna, directed in 2004 was the beginning of his trial and error with Sri Lankan theatre. He had no hurry to come up with his own script. He notes that he was too nave to work on a script of his own. Hathlahawatta was a final year undergraduate at the University of Kelaniya, when he employed a script based on Akira Kurasowas One Wonderful Sunday (translated by Professor Ariya Rajakaruna).
That was meant to cinema. I needed to try out how it could be adapted to suit the stage. So I came up with a script where two lovers spend a Sunday with only Rs 171.50. On the cinema script, the lovers roam in various places. On stage we created sub stages to indicate the number of places.
In 2014, he directed Makarata based on kolam tradition.
I think we have ignored the kolam tradition. We have been taking some parts from Kolam tradition. For Makarata, I extracted the pure kolam tradition. The hero becomes the dragon, and the dragon becomes a hero.
Although the Sri Lankan thespians cannot look forward to an equally good audience like they had back in the sixties, Hathlahawatta nonetheless has immense faith in his forte. The competition is bigger with television, cinema and digital technology. On the other hand, the hilarious plays plague the industry.
There is one good thing about the common hilarious plays. They encourage us to keep fingers crossed about the industry. At least the stage managers would not leave the industry, which is good. At least we have something called theatre. So we need comedies for the sake of survival, Hathlahawatta observes.
Chamika Haththalawa teaches drama to O-L as well as A-L in addition to being a visiting lecturer at universities. He cites various professional thespians such as Vijeya Nandasiri, Sanath Wimalsiri and Jagath Chamila to indicate that theatre could serve as professionalism.
We need comedy trend very much. It was in Greece. It was in Rome. But we need to focus on quality. We need to pay attention to the script, director and performance. Most plays are directed with the sole aim of making money. That is also needed, but we need to pay attention to quantity. For that we need a proper programme to work on, Hathlahawatta opines.
Raja Man Vahala will be staged at the Lionel Wendt on April 1 at 7 pm.

Tokyo golf club lifts ban on women members
Tokyo: The private Japanese club picked to host golf at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics decided on Monday to lift its controversial ban on full female membership after pressure from the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The Kasumigaseki Country Club in Saitama prefecture, north of Tokyo, agreed to allow women members at an extraordinary board meeting on Monday, JiJi Press said.
Immediate comment from the club was not available, but the decision was welcomed by organisers of the Tokyo Games.
It came after IOC chief Thomas Bach on Friday reiterated his threat to take the golf event elsewhere, saying he was hopeful the club would opt for non-discrimination.
Tokyos female governor Yuriko Koike had also complained about the ban, saying she felt extreme discomfort to see women with no right to be full members in the 21st century.
The Japanese club has women on its roster but they are not allowed to become full members and cannot play on certain Sundays -- restrictions that do not apply to male members.
Tokyo 2020 chief Yoshiro Mori welcomed the clubs decision, saying it amended the policy in keeping with the spirit of the Olympic Charter.
I truly appreciate the numerous efforts that the clubs senior leaderships and all the club members have made so far to meet the requirements for hosting Olympic competitions, Mori said in a statement.
The clubs chairman told local media earlier this month he was flummoxed by the row, prompting further criticism.
The decision also came after Scotlands prestigious Muirfield club voted to allow women members last week, ditching a rule which had stood for 273 years. AFP

Trinity downs S. Thomas to regain title
The ruggerites from Trinity College, Kandy regained the prestigious Canon R.S. De Saram Trophy by beating SThomas College Mount Lavinia by 29 points (5 tries, 2 conversions) to 14 (2 tries, 2 conversions) in their Singer A Division inter-schools League rugby first round match played at CR & FC grounds in Longden Place yesterday. At half time the winners led 19-0.
Trinity showed better control of the ball in perfect conditions and turned the match in their favour with a rousing first half rally.
The ruggerites from Kandy were always sure of what to do, in contrast to the Thomians who only knew to run straight, often ramming into their opposite numbers their by lost the grip as they seemed hampered.
Their hopes of winning seemed thrust under a dark cloud as their play maker cum captain Naveen Heenakankanamge left the field with an injury just before half time and the score read 19 points to nil in Trinitys favour at the breather.
However the Thomians staged a spirited comeback in the second half to close the gap with the scores reading 24-14, but still Trinity in the lead.
Trinity College boys gave a superb brand of running rugby where they enjoyed the major share of possession from the set pieces and put up an unthinkable effort to topple the S Thomas College in the second half as well.
They dared to run the ball quickly into the gaps and gained advantage when ever a gap was detected in the opponents defense.
Finally Trinity College Kandy sealed the game by scoring 5 tries in the game through winger Amit Kulathunga-2, scrum half Anouk Boyagoda-1, captain and number eight Nathan Yee Chan-1 and fly half Akith Sakalasooriya-1 while the two conversions were done by Lashan Wijesuriya.

UNICEF appeals for 1 million dollar funding for Sri Lanka's drought

The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) on Tuesday appealed for 1 million US dollars in funding to support Sri Lanka during its ongoing drought.
Sri Lanka was currently in the midst of its worst drought in 40 years, with over 1.2 million people, including 365,232 children directly affected and in need of humanitarian assistance, the UNICEF said in a statement.
A report released by UNICEF on World Water Day said that 36 countries across the globe were currently facing extremely high levels of water stress, which occurs when demand for water far exceeds the renewable supply available.
The report said warmer temperatures, rising sea levels, increased floods, droughts and melting ice affect the quality and availability of water as well as sanitation systems.
UNICEF said whilst Sri Lanka was not listed among the 36 countries facing extremely high levels of water stress, Sri Lanka and its children were already experiencing the impact of climate change, with a cycle of climate related disasters resulting in dire consequences for the most vulnerable.
"We know that water emergencies not only endanger lives and limit the availability of safe water essential for health and life - but have multiple knock-on effects such as destroying crops, increasing farmer indebtedness and driving food insecurity," said Tim Sutton, UNICEF Sri Lanka Representative.
"These drastically impact children, especially the most vulnerable. We must take collective action to respond to the ongoing drought, and to ensure that Sri Lanka is ready and prepared for future water challenges, so that children's futures are not jeopardized," Sutton added.
Sutton further said UNICEF was working with the Sri Lankan government and partners to address the immediate water needs of 365,323 children affected by the drought, and to build increased resilience in water supply services, to ensure the most vulnerable are protected from the worst impacts of climate change in Sri Lanka.
"We are calling on our donors to support this vital work," the UNICEF representative said.

US to ban laptops and tablets on flights from eight countries

The US is banning electronic devices such as laptops and tablets from cabin baggage on flights from eight Middle Eastern and North African countries.
A US government source told the BBC that the measure would affect nine airlines operating out of 10 airports.
US media reported the order was sparked by intelligence gathered overseas.
It will reportedly include all large electronic devices such as laptops, tablets cameras, DVD players and electronic games.
But mobile phones and smartphones will still be allowed in carry-on luggage.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) declined to comment on the issue but is expected to make an announcement on Tuesday.
Last February an aircraft operated by the Dubai-based carrier Daallo was damaged by an explosion shortly after take-off from the Somali capital, Mogadishu.
Investigators said a passenger who was sucked out of the plane had been carrying a laptop bomb. The pilot managed to land and the alleged bomber was the only fatality. Had the device gone off at cruising altitude the plane would almost certainly have been destroyed.
The Islamic militant group al-Shabab, which is linked to al-Qaeda, claimed that it was responsible and the possibility of further such attacks is apparently what is now concerning American spies.
But, as ever with matters of intelligence, officials are reluctant to go into detail about exactly why the ban is being proposed.
That means travellers being asked to trust the US government when it says that this inconvenience is vital for their own safety and - at present - trust is a commodity which is in very short supply.
What happened in Somali plane bomb
The Transportation Security Administration, which is part of Homeland Security, also refused to comment.
It is unclear which airlines would fall under the ban and how long it will be in place.
But Royal Jordanian Airlines tweeted on Monday that it would ban passengers from carrying on most electronics to and from its North American flights,CNN first reported.
The tweet was later deleted.
The Jordan-based carrier said that starting on Tuesday, it will only allow phones and medical devices on its flights. All other electronics would be "strictly prohibited".
The airline said that laptops, tablets, DVD players and electronic games must be checked with baggage.
The new rule will affect Royal Jordanian flights to New York, Chicago, Detroit and Montreal.
Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly reportedly called congressional lawmakers over the weekend to explain the travel security issues that prompted the electronics ban, a congressional aide briefed on the discussion told the AP news agency.
The new ban has been under consideration for several weeks, according to US media.

Vidyartha Colllege, Kandy earned a good victory over St. Sylvesters College beating the latter by 55 points (6 goals , 2 tries and a penalty ) to 5 (1 try) at the Nittawela ground in their inter school rugby match and walked away with the Banda - Nillagoda Memorial Cup. At half time winners led 27-00.
The Banda - Nillagoda Memorial Cup is a six-game series between the two schools and this year Vidyartha has won all six games to bag the trophy.
This is St. Sylvesters second defeat in the season as they have been already beaten by Kingswood College two weeks ago.
Vidyartha fared well so far this season winning all three matches played against Ananda, Maliyadeva and this time arch rivals St. Sylvesters. Old Vidyarthian Rangith Weerasinghe was the chief guest at the award ceremony. In this game Vidyartha lads who are under the watchful eyes of Anil Jayasnghe displayed some superb brand of rugby to crush Sylvestrians.
This defeat will cause more misery on the embattled Sylverstains who in the past two weeks have suffered their heaviest home losses at the hands of Kingswood and Vidyartha.

What ails the health sector!
The hard working Sri Lankan doctors are being regularly exposed to criticism in the press by expatriate medical men. Although only a few returnees indulge in this exercise, their writings get prominence in the press painting a bad and unfair picture about the doctors in this country. Though an eminent cardiologist is leading among them, this article is a response to a letter of Dr. Ayesha Muthuveloe that appeared in a weekly of March 5. Unfortunately these good Samaritans have ignored the basic lesson we were taught in clinical medicine; that no proper diagnosis can be made on current clinical features alone without understanding the background to the illness.
I must stress at the outset that the majority of Sri Lankan doctors working abroad are well meaning people. They have done well bringing honour to the motherland, at times reaching the pinnacle in the health service of the respective countries. They have been instrumental in finding placements for our post graduate trainees in the best centres in their countries.
These expatriates are valuable resource persons for various educational activities for doctors here. In addition they donate entire hospitals, equip them, provide scholarships to needy students, and indulge in various charitable activities to help the countrymen back home. Our fellowship has been for mutual benefit. For this we are ever so grateful to them. They do not waste time criticizing the way the doctors work here.
Sri Lankan health service
Let me explain how I understand the background of those few who have turned part time preachers trying to rectify anomalies in the Sri Lankan health service. Most, if not all, of them have received free education here but left the country for greener pastures. At least some of them left in anger when they could not be happy with the working conditions here.
Having served those prosperous societies with all the facilities, yet often treated as second class citizens, they have accumulated enough wealth at a relatively leisurely pace. Their mistakes have been well covered by insurance. They have educated their off spring in good schools. They are now earning healthy pensions which leave them with no need to work any further. During this period when they were missing, their kith and kin at home were looked after by doctors in Sri Lanka.
They, lacking recognition after retirement in those countries, return home with their rather easily earned lucre and acquire a luxury living.
With guilt pricking their conscience, they even offer free services to poor locals. They occupy penthouses in the best parts of Colombo. From those heights, they survey their other acquisitions down below. In doing so, some of them happen to see among others, Sri Lankan doctors trying hard from dawn till late at night to make a reasonable living. This is when they feel like delivering sermons from their high pedestals.
Social problems
Having explained the background of the ones delivering sermons, let me now give the background of the patient they are trying to cure, or more aptly, to kill.
The doctor in Sri Lanka, as everyone else, starts his life after a struggle by their parents to get admitted to a school. They know that in most instances, their parents had to forge documents, go behind politicians and pay huge bribes even to school authorities to get in. In school they see some of their own teachers neglecting school work giving private tuition till late at night charging huge fees, often from their own students in the school. They are witnesses to many instances of favouritism whereby one has to please the teacher by irregular means to get good marks at exams or to get a place in a sports team.
Private practice
Having gone through a system of education with no fun, leisure or any input on ethical issues, they enter the university. Here they are exposed to all elements with social problems which I need not elaborate here. The turmoil in the university system ensures that the young doctor passing out could be quite skeptical about the values in society.
The doctor is then expected to serve in any part of the country, quite rightly, but provided with poor facilities for patient care and a decent living. He sees all around him, much less educated people including dirty politicians (yes, I mean very dirty, except for a very few) at all levels enjoying luxury living at public expense and by fraudulent means. He can see much injustice, whereby obvious wrong doers are never punished due to political patronage. He has to earn enough money to buy a reasonable dwelling, a decent car and educate his children often at great cost. Thus it is nave to expect a doctor in such circumstances to behave as a Good Samaritan doing his best for patient care, neglecting his own family responsibilities. No wonder this malady affects the rest of the public service as well.
It is really praiseworthy that the majority of Sri Lankan doctors choose to remain in Sri Lanka or return home after post graduate studies abroad despite being offered lucrative permanent jobs overseas. They do a yeoman service out of humanitarian concerns and the love for the motherland. Their services maintaining a high standard of health care with limited resources go unnoticed or are taken for granted by everyone.
I do not for a moment condone the questionable activities of a few doctors that bring disrepute to the profession. Doing private practice during hospital working hours, spending only two to three minutes for a consultation in their rush to see twenty patients in one hour, some charging exorbitant fees for their service and the alleged unholy alliance with the suppliers of pharmaceutical products and appliances, are all practices that should be condemned by all. Unfortunately the authorities who have all the powers to apprehend such wrong doers appear to be unconcerned.
It is high time those owning and operating the private hospitals understood the essential difference between providing health care to the sick and their all other business activities.
Humanitarian considerations should take priority over profit motive. It should be noted that providing healthcare is perhaps the only instance where the salesman (doctor or hospital) decides what the customer (patient) should buy! Hence there is a heavy moral responsibility on our part to ensure that our actions are not discoloured by financial considerations.
Thus it is worthwhile for the doctors who have recently returned after many years abroad, or make casual visits to avoid the miserable winters back home, to plead with the corrupt authorities to provide a better life for all citizens including the doctors.
They would do well to understand that the doctor is a product of the society that nurture them.

Wimal Weerawansa further remanded till April 3
National Freedom Front leader MP Wimal Weerawansa arrested for allegedly misusing 40 vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (SEC) while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs. 91 million to the government, was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till April 3 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne. The Magistrate yesterday refused to release Wimal Weerawansa on bail citing that no exceptional circumstance surfaced before Court to release the suspect on bail.
Weerawansa was arrested by the FCID on January 10 under Public Property Act charges.
On January 24, the Magistrate refused to enlarge the former Minister on bail observing that the evidence presented before Court have proved that former Minister Weerawansa had intentionally given these vehicles to his close relatives and his party activists while they were not holding any position at the SEC.
The Magistrate further observed that it is apparent that the former Minister has intentionally and dishonestly misappropriated these vehicles by entrusting them to his close relatives and party activists.
Wimal Weerawansa had sought bail from Colombo High Court challenging the Fort Magistrates order to refuse bail and this bail revision application is to be taken up for order today.
The FCID conducting investigations into the alleged misuse of state vehicles had informed Court that Weerawansa had given his written and verbal approval to the commission to commit these offences while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister.
These vehicles had been given to the SEC on a rental basis to carry out ministerial functions. However, the vehicles in question had been given to five relatives of the former minister, including his sister. Ten other vehicles were given to 10 officials of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna and the other vehicles were given to his staff members who were not entitled to receive them, the FCID had told Court.
The FCID alleged that Weerawansa had given these vehicles for the use of his close relatives and private staff members without Treasury approval during 2010 to 2015.
However, the defence had denied the allegations and informed Court that the FCID is conducting a politically motivated inquiry to punish the governments political opponents. The FCID had filed a B report in Court against Weerawansa alleging that he misused 40 vehicles while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs. 91 million to the state.

Women represent 36.5 percent of Sri Lankas labour force at present while 40 percent of the public service is represented by women. Women's representation in the provincial public service is 60 percent, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said.
He was addressing a ceremony at Koggala to mark the International Women's Day, recently.
According to Minister Seneviratne, 68 percent of the total number of teachers in Sri Lanka is women and 60 percent of the workforce in 12 free trade zones is represented by women. More women get through competitive examinations and join the public service, the minister said.
Minister Seneviratne said women's representation in politics in Sri Lanka is, however, low. Therefore, it has been made compulsory to appoint 25 percent of women into the Local Government bodies through next LG polls. At least one fourth of all nomination lists should include women, he added.
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said there are around 7,000 female Grama Niladharis at the moment. Women have been appointed for almost all positions in the public service. Today women are in high positions everywhere, he added.
