Ancient traders well noted Sri Lankas strategic location
Sri Lankas strategic location in the Indian Ocean was well noted by ancient traders who travelled from east to west and vice versa.
It formed an integral part of the original maritime silk route. Today a revival of the trading traditions is seen with the launch of the Colombo International Shopping Festival spanning the length and breadth of the country, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister Amaratunga said
The Festival will be held for the first time in Sri Lanka under the patronage of Minister Amaratunga from October 20-22 at the SLECC from 10 am to 10 pm each day.
The event is organised by the Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Ministry in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau and Sri Lanka Retailers Association to showcase and create the ultimate shopping experience and to promote Sri Lanka as a shopping destination for tourists. The event will be marked as an annual event in the Tourism calendar.
It offers an ideal platform to showcase our produce ranging from spices, handicraft, jewellery, clothing and food to hi-tech electrical and electronic equipment at very competitive prices. The festival is an added attraction for tourists to visit the beautiful island and benefit from the shopping bargains on offer for global brands, the Minister said.
Secretary to the Ministry Esala Weerakoon said this was a significant milestone in tourism development  one great window of opportunity for tourists attracted by the beauty and the serenity of our country.
They will now have more to look for and to take back pleasant memories. It is equally beneficial to Sri Lankans here and abroad who can learn of the strides we are making, he said.
The festival will bring a new dimension towards the shopping experience in Sri Lanka, allowing the consumers to buy renowned brands at the most costeffective manner by catering to each need by expanding services related to travel, lodging, payment, and showcasing what Sri Lanka has to offer.
The event will promote Sri Lanka as a "shopping hub" and attracting tourists to have a shopping experience in the typical Sri Lankan style.

Food items for consumers at lower prices
The government expects to provide consumers food items at a lower price throughout the year to control the short-term price fluctuations to alleviate the hardships of the people, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was delivering the Economic Policy Statement in Parliament yesterday.
We will improve the domestic supply chains and distribution networks. In the meantime, we will allow the importing of food products and other essential commodities at reasonable prices within a competitive market framework.
We have reduced taxes on food commodities substantially over the past three months. We urge domestic wholesalers and retailers to pass the benefits of these reductions to the consumers, the Prime Minister said. However, the Premier said the government will provide the space to the Central Bank to carry out its Monetary Policy independently, in order to maintain price stability on a sustainable basis.
The Central Bank is moving towards a new Monetary Policy framework targeting a flexible inflation.
The aim of this framework is to maintain a low inflation continuously, while supporting economic activities, the Prime Minister said, adding that with this change of policy,people would get the opportunity to live comfortably with the assurance of price stability.

United States GP:
Can Hamilton wrap up title
The United States Grand Prix could be the race at which Lewis Hamilton wins his fourth world title.
It's not likely - Hamilton needs to score 16 more points than Sebastian Vettel to do it - but the way things have been going for Ferrari in recent races, it cannot be ruled out.
Vettel and Ferrari's season has collapsed in spectacular fashion over the three Asian races in Singapore, Malaysia and Japan, and the team and driver have only themselves to blame.
The German triggered the start-line crash that took out himself, team-mate Kimi Raikkonen and Red Bull's Max Verstappen at the start in Singapore, and then Ferrari's reliability went south in Malaysia and Japan.
The good news for Vettel is that if he can just get through this weekend and stay in the game, the next race in Mexico could give him a chance to keep things alive for even longer.
The bad news for him is that, unlike Mexico City, the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas, is not a track Mercedes especially fear. They don't expect to dominate, but they feel they should at least be competitive - although if the weather remains as forecast at around 30C ambient, that might change.
Cota, as they call it, is a rare new track in F1 where the architects have got things absolutely right. It has a bit of everything and is a great place to watch racing, as well as a challenge for the drivers.
It is arguably the best new circuit to emerge on to the calendar in 20 years, but there is more to the success of the latest iteration of the US Grand Prix than that. As a package, the weekend is difficult to beat.
Ask anyone in F1 what are their favourite races and you can guarantee that Austin is right up there.
The track is excellent, the crowd is large, knowledgeable, warm and enthusiastic, and it is all held down the road from one of the most enjoyable cities in America.
Austin might not have the glamour and cachet of New York or Los Angeles but it is a terrific little place - and about as far from the cliched image of Texas as you can get.
Yes, just outside it there are Western stores and trailer parks, big skies and big horizons - and all that is wonderful in itself.
But the city itself is a little jewel - cosmopolitan, vibrant, atmospheric, packed full of restaurants and bars and with live music all over town.
It's not perfect, of course. The traffic can be pretty bad - but at least you can usually enjoy a glorious Texas sunset while you're sitting in it.  BBC

Education policy to recruit only trained teachers
An education policy where only trained teachers will be recruited to the government service will be introduced in the future, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday as he handed over teaching appointments to science teachers who achieved National Diplomas in Teaching.
Addressing the diploma holders at a ceremony at Temple Trees, he asked the Minister of Education to speedily submit necessary legislation to the Cabinet to turn the policy into law.Sixty percent of teachers in the national cadre do not have university degrees or diplomas in teaching, said the Prime Minister, as he spoke of the biggest problem in the countrys education system.
The Finance Secretary, Minister of Education and I recently went on a tour of Finland to study their education system.
"They have the best education system in the world, and all their teachers are graduates while principals and administrators hold postgraduate degrees, said the Premier as he noted that a Finnish teacher would spend up to four years to qualify to teach.
Thirty one years ago, when I visited Finland, I saw the emphasis on teacher training and thus we came back and established the National Institute of Education and special streams of education.
"When the 13th Amendment was presented, we included a clause which stated that all teacher training should be conducted by the central government, said Wickremesinghe.If we had continued our training programmes, our education system would have been vastly improved, he added.
The Premier explained that Sri Lanka lagged behind because politicians could not take the important decision that teacher training was a must.
When we train teachers, the education level of students improve. With untrained teachers, the education level drops, he said, adding that most trained teachers tend to be in urban centres while rural areas get poor quality teachers.The Provincial Councils have to take responsibility for this. They do not recruit trained teachers into their cadre, he added.
The Prime Minister said in future, all appointees would have to be trained and existing untrained teachers would be given training. As Sri Lanka looks to become the Education Hub of the Indian Ocean, the Prime Minister hoped that the diploma holders of today would be able to achieve that vision.
At present, we still have the highest number of school going children in South Asia but at the same time, we have the least number of trained teachers, said the Premier.
He expressed hope that the new appointees would choose to further their education during the course of their career to be the most qualified teachers in the country.

Five records that have not been broken in over 100 years
Cricket's premier format, Test match cricket, has been played for more than 140 years. The format itself has withstood the test of time. Last week, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan in a very interesting Test match. Including that game, there have been a total of 2278 Test matches played till now.
In these 2278 Test matches, feats have been recorded pertaining to almost every aspect of the game. From most runs in a career to most runs in an over, we have records for every facet of the game.
It is said that records are meant to be broken. Yet, there are few records that have lived on for over 100 years. Here are five records that have stood strong since the end of the 19th century.
#1 HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF RUNS IN A COMPLETED TEST INNINGS (1877)
This record was made in the first Test match ever played and is yet to be broken. Unbelievable as it may sound, Charles Bannerman of Australia (who is also the first batsman to face a delivery in Test cricket) scored 165 runs of the team's 245. This makes Bannerman's percentage a staggering 67.34%.
Starting on 15th March 1877 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the match ended in four days with Australia winning by 45 runs. (Official Test status to this match was bestowed later).
The closest anyone has ever come to breaking this record is another Australian batsman, Michael Slater. Also opening the innings, he scored 123 out of the team's 186 against England at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1999. Slater managed to score 66.84% of the total runs in that innings.
Even though such a feat requires a mammoth solo effort, it also requires failure on the part of the team-mates.
#2 HIGHEST SCORE BATTING AT NUMBER 10 (1884)
The records for the highest individual score at each batting position are mostly held by batsmen of the modern era - the exception being number 10!
The 16th Test match, played at The Oval between England and Australia in 1884, set the stage for this particular record. Australia put up 551 runs in the first innings, thanks to three centuries scored by middle order batsmen. England bowled 311 overs in total with all 11 players having a go.
In reply, the home team stumbled to a dismal 181/8. Walter Read then joined the opener William Scotton, who had managed to anchor himself at the crease. The duo then put up a partnership of 151 runs. Read was the last man out, having scored 117 which included 20 boundaries. Although England could not avoid the follow-on, the match was drawn.
Since then, only three other cricketers have scored centuries batting at number 10. Abul Hasan's debut Test century of 113 runs for Bangladesh, against West Indies in 2011, remains the second highest.
#3 LOWEST BOWLING AVERAGE AND STRIKE-RATE (1896)
This is one of the most phenomenal records to have survived the test of time. In the days when batting was not easy, a certain George Lohmann wreaked havoc. A medium pace bowler from Surrey with immaculate control over line and length, his variations bamboozled the batsmen.
Lohmann recorded bowling figures of 9/28 against South Africa at Johannesburg in 1896. These remained the best bowling figures in Test cricket until fellow Englishman Jim Laker took ten wickets in an innings in 1956. Lohmann retired after playing 18 Tests with a bowling average of 10.75 and a strike rate of 34.1 with 112 wickets to his name.
He holds the record for the lowest ever bowling average & strike rate in the history of Test cricket with the criterion being a minimum of 2000 balls bowled. Although a few bowlers did come close to taking a wicket every 34.1 balls, none of them are from the modern era.
#4 OLDEST TEST CAPTAIN (1899)
The first superstar of cricket holds this age-related record. In his heyday, Dr. William Gilbert Grace ruled over the hearts of English cricket fans. Stadiums were packed when he was batting and they emptied out once he was dismissed. The legendary amateur cricketer scored over 54000+ first-class runs and took more than 2800 first-class wickets in his illustrious career.
Born in 1848, WG as he was fondly known, also played an active part in the Test match that culminated with the birth of the Ashes. In the twilight of his career, the bearded hero became the captain of the England team at the age of 50, in 1899.
Grace, however, was smart enough to understand that his fitness levels would not match the requirements of the game. He soon handed over the captaincy to Archie MacLaren. Grace played the last Test match of his career in 1899 against the Australians.
At 50 years and 320 days, Grace became the oldest captain in Test cricket. With hardly any modern cricketer extending his Test career beyond the age of 40, it is likely that this record too shall never be broken.
#5 HIGHEST SCORE IN TEST DEBUT INNINGS (1903)
Reginald 'Tip' Foster was born in a sporting family in the year 1878. He, along with six of his brothers, represented Worcestershire. Hence, for some time, the county was comically referred to as 'Fostershire'.
Tip was the most talented sportsperson in his family. He even represented England in five international soccer matches.
Prior to his Test debut in 1903, Foster had already amassed a great number of runs in county cricket. He was honoured with the 'Wisden Cricketer of The Year' award in 1901.
Foster then concentrated on his profession as a stockbroker and played first-class cricket sparingly.
He, however, did enough to be chosen for the tour to Australia in 1903. Foster played well against the Australian state teams and was selected in the playing XI for the Sydney Test.
Australia scored 285 runs in their first innings. When Foster walked out to bat, England had stumbled to 73/3. He put on 245 runs with the last two batsmen and was the last man to get out. His score of 287 was higher than what Australia had scored in their first innings.
England went on to win the Test match. Foster's 287 was the highest score in Test cricket at that time. Till date, it remains the highest score in a debut Test innings. The closest someone has come to breaking this record was Jacques Rudolph, who scored 222 against Bangladesh on his debut in 2003.
With the improved run-rates at which teams bat nowadays, it is probable that someday some youngster will improve upon this record which has stood for 114 years now.
After all, records are meant to be broken.  SK

Give priority to truth
Fake news is a term that we hear often these days, especially in the context of social media such as Facebook and Twitter. But sometimes even mainstream news outlets can get the facts wrong, either deliberately or inadvertently. This has the effect of misleading the public at large, unlike the social media sites which are accessible to only a certain percentage of the population.
There are a lot of misconceptions floating around the proposed new Constitution. Among these rumours are: it is federalist in nature; it will divide the country; it will take away the foremost place granted to Buddhism. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have persistently denied these rumours and accusations and even a cursory glance at the first drafts vindicate their position.
In a vibrant democracy, it is not surprising to have a raging debate on a matter as vital as a new Constitution. However, certain opportunistic politicians have used this platform and opportunity to spread falsehoods about the new Constitution. Some politicians have been going around the country educating the Maha Sangha and other members of the clergy about the dangers posed by the new Constitution.
However, when a group of politicians led by Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena met the Most Venerable Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter, the Thera pointedly told the delegation that the President and the Prime Minister would never allow a divisive Constitution. He said the MPs should have raised their concerns during the Constitution making process itself, having participated in the deliberations over several months.
So when certain newspapers (not of the Lake House group) carried the banner headline Malwatte and Asgiriya prelates oppose new Constitution, something seemed to be out of place. It has now been revealed that the Most Ven. Nayake Thera had told the Prime Minister that some privately-owned newspapers and TV networks misled the public into believing that he had objected to a new statute being formulated. After seeing the headline news item, the Prime Minister said he contacted the Chief Priest who assured him that he had not made any comments opposing the reform process. It has transpired that the Chief Priest has not even been in the country at the time. Most Ven. Dimbulkumbure Wimaladhamma Anu Nayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter has also confirmed that their Chapter does not oppose the formulation of a new Constitution.
However, the Prime Minister said the basis for the newspaper report appeared to be a press conference given by the Diyawadana Nilame (chief lay custodian of the Temple of the Tooth), based on a Kaaraka Sabha (Ex-Co) meeting of the Asgiriya and Malwatte Chapters. The said news item has apparently been given a spin to give the impression that the Malwatte Chapter itself was against the new Constitution.
Obviously, that would have been marked departure from the Most Ven. Theras stance on the new Constitution, which the public already know about from his interactions with politicians and public pronouncements. Such an apparent turnaround is an obviously sensational piece of news for any newspaper or TV station.
This is one danger opposed by the highly competitive nature of the media industry, where sometimes the ethics of journalism and the truth itself fall by the wayside to make way for headlines that sell. Sensationalism works, but the media has to be more responsible in a country like ours, emerging from a 30-year-old conflict and seeking reconciliation among different communities. The media can build and mould opinion and also inflame communal passions, so the gatekeepers in the media, essentially the editors, must know where to draw the line.
This was also the gist of President Maithripala Sirisenas address at a separate function held in honour of the late doyen of local journalism D.B. Dhanapala. Journalisms first obligation is to tell the truth, President Maithripala Sirisena asserted, adding that journalists should use their pen to give accurate and truthful information to the public without resorting to biased or false news reporting. He noted that journalists should not pander to the whims of politicians but rather reports the facts.
Thanks to the proliferation of social media, news is not what it used to be. One has to do a double take on almost everything that appears online masquerading as news and not to be outdone, mainstream outlets also tend to perpetuate some of these untruths. One recent example was the uproar over plastic rice which turned out to be a total fabrication. Another viral social media post alleged that the Government intended to appoint teachers representing another community to leading Buddhist schools, which also turned out to be a totally false.
Unfortunately, some people tend to believe these made-up stories and share them online without realising the great danger they pose to society. It is impossible to control such online material, but Internet users must think twice about sharing possibly controversial posts that can possibly harm us all. We must consume news in the true sense of the word and not allow false news to consume us.

JRs grandson to contest forthcoming elections under SLFP
The late President J. R. Jayewardenes grandson, Pradeep Jayewardene, yesterday said he would contest the upcoming Colombo Municipal Council elections in January under the SLFP.
Jayewardene, who is SLFP organiser for the Gampaha district, held the position of Sri Lanka Consul General in Frankfurt, Germany under the former President Mahinda Rajapaksas government.
Addressing a media briefing held at the Colombo Swimming Club, Pradeep was of the opinion that his entry into politics at the local level would help him in his campaign against the new Constitution.
The country will be unmanageable if the Executive Presidency is abolished and power further devolved, Jayewardene said and added that the Government should not even talk about a new Constitution at this time.
He said constitutional making process had no consensus and the various parties were so opposed to each other that there was no way they could agree on a common document.
Jayewardene said his grandfather would have never agreed to a new Constitution and that there was no need for a new one, In 1972, we needed one to establish a republic, in 1978 to form the Executive Presidency which brought stability to the country. It helped us concentrate on economic development. There is no justifiable reasons to have a new one now, he said.
He said a new Constitution would not solve the ethnic problem in the country. He said the 13th Amendment was the best and the Government should not move away from the word unitary and use the words ekiya in Sinhala and Orumitha nadu in Tamil instead. He saw a plot to divide the country through such means.
Jayewardene said that granting land rights to the people through a new Constitution would only take away valuable state land in the North. "They must be developed and hand over to the people there," he said.
He said he would work with all parties to fight against the new Constitution though he no longer believed in the UNP, which has sought to abandon his grandfathers Constitution.

Jumbo issue tramples rural lives in Hambantota
Hambantota District Secretary W.H .Karunaratne said 400 to 500 wild elephants were invading the villages in the district in search of food as they had lost their natural habitats.
The Divisional Secretary was addressing the Hambantota District Agricultural Committee meeting held recently.
Karunaratne said deforestation for the sake of development and human activities worsen the situation.
He said two wild elephants entered Walasmulla and Weeraketiya and four invaded Ambalantota and suburbs and villagers were undergoing severe difficulties as a result.
District Secretary said wild elephants entered villages in fear of fire crackers. "Instead of firing crackers, villagers must assist Wildlife officers to tackle the issue," he said.
"An electric fence was erected covering Hambantota, Tissamaharamaya, Suriyawewa and Angunukolapelessa on the request of the people but wild elephant invade villages as the fence was not properly maintained," he said.
Hambantota Range Wildlife Office J.A.P. Wijeyakumara said people get together to get rid of the shortcomings arising from the human activities.
He said small forests near villages should be cleared to remove wild elephants. Vijayakumara said an area from Hambantota to Mattala were reserved to manage wild elephants but it was not gazetted.
Therefore, people enter the area and clear the jungle, burn it, and hunt wild animals and chase the elephants. "The elephants enter the villages and a limited number of officers at the Hambantota Wildlife Office cannot carry out their duty properly," he said.

Middlesex relegation stands after failed crossbow appeal
Middlesex have failed in their appeal against a two-point deduction in the County Championship, confirming their relegation from Division One.
The punishment came for their slow over rate during Augusts match at Surrey, which was abandoned when a crossbow bolt was fired into The Oval.
Middlesex finished one point below Somerset, who were ready to take legal action if the appeal was successful.
Middlesex, county champions in 2016, will play in Division Two next season.
The Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) ruled that the matter did not need referring to a disciplinary panel hearing as rules relating to over rates are clear and understood by all teams, coaches, players, and captains.
MIDDLESEX ACCEPT DECISION
Confirming that the county would not be taking the matter any further, chief executive Richard Goatley told Middlesexs website: Whilst we still believe the imposition of the penalty was unjust, we accept the decision of the Chairman of the CDC and will move on.
We do not believe that any further action is in the interests of Middlesex or the wider game. We will now focus on regaining a place in the 1st Division at the earliest opportunity.
Somerset counterpart Lee Cooper said in a statement that his club were always confident that the ECBs original decision would stand and were delighted with the outcome.
We are pleased that this has now been put to rest and we can concentrate on preparing for next season, he added.
HOW DID WE GET TO THIS POINT
Middlesex were deducted two points after the crossbow incident at The Oval denied them the chance to improve their over rate in the remainder of the final session of that match.
After the punishment was announced on 9 September, Middlesex CEO Goatley said there was no scope for an appeal, despite the fact he was extremely disappointed by the decision.
Middlesex went on to lose their final game of the season at Somerset, who leapfrogged the 2016 champions with victory at Taunton to seal their own survival.
A day after their relegation, managing director of cricket Angus Fraser told BBC Radio London they would raise the circumstances of the deduction with the ECB.
And Middlesex confirmed they had made submissions to the chairman of the CDC over the issue last week.
THE FINAL DECISION
Cricket Discipline Commission chairman Tim OGorman said: Middlesex have sought to argue that it was only because of the abandonment of the game that they did not make up their overs, but that cannot be entirely correct.
There was no guarantee that, if the game had run its normal course, those overs could ever have been made up.
I do not accept that Middlesex only agreed to the abandonment of the match on condition that their slow over rate in the first innings would be overlooked.
It is not within the power or gift of either the umpires or the players to make deals like that.
The match was abandoned for safety reasons. Play ended accordingly and the points earned or deducted should stand with effect from that time.

Myanmar Police clash with jade scavengers: 5 dead
MYANMAR: At least five people were killed and 20 injured after Myanmar police opened fire on an armed mob of jade seekers that tried to enter a mine in the far north, state media reported Friday, the latest deadly incident in a murky multi-billion-dollar industry.
The violence erupted after police blocked around 50 jade scavengers from accessing an industrial plot owned by 111 Company in Kachin State's Hpakant -- the hub of a lucrative trade beset by worker unrest, deadly landslides, corruption and drug abuse. An hour later, nearly 600 people returned and attacked the police, burning dump trucks and destroying a backhoe, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar reported.
As police were attacked with knives, police opened fire to drive back the attackers, the state mouthpiece said.
Five people were killed and 20 people and five police officers were injured, it added.
Two locals in Hpakant told AFP Friday the toll was higher, with at least seven killed at the scene and three more having died in hospital.
Most of the world's best quality jadeite is mined in Hpakant -- a once lush region that has been carved into a barren moonscape by industrial firms linked to Myanmar's junta-era elite.
The vast majority of the stone is shipped to neighbouring China where there is a seemingly insatiable demand for the green gemstone which is considered lucky.
In recent years poor workers from across Myanmar have poured into Hpakant to scour the rubble for any hunks of stone passed over by the mining giants.

National Innovation Centre opens in Narahenpita
The government has prioritised to develop skills of young entrepreneurs and innovators who can take the country forward.
Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Chandima Weerakkody said the government has decided to give priority to the skills sector education, which includes vocational training and technical education.
Weerakkody addressing the opening of the National Innovation Centre (NIC) set up by the National Institute of Business Management (NIBM) in collaboration with Malaysias Limkokwing University of Creative Technology in Narahenpita said "We must open our avenues for Sri Lankan youth to think to be creative; to guide them on how to be creative,"he said.
The Center was opened by President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday.
This center will create a conducive environment for empowering the future generation with the demanding entrepreneurial skills along with modern technology, innovation and creativity. We expect to sharpen creativity that is hidden in a youth by training them the proper way and giving them good exposure in the job market, Minister Weerakkody said.
He said most of the youth across the world are earning for themselves with their innovations. We must also create such a situation here, he added.
The Sri Lankan education sector needs to break away from exam-based school education and stereotypical academic education. The World can be changed based on innovations and not based on conventional thinking. Innovations are made possible by the people who get direct
ideas and act on them. Therefore, we have to outside the box when it comes to the education and give prominence for the innovations.
The government has given prominence for a comprehensive programme to provide vocational training to students who are not selected to enter local universities. Budget 2018 will make more allocations for this programme in a bid to empower youth in economically.
Skills Development and Vocational Training Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana said creativity and innovation are two of the most crucial competencies currently in demand in the job market. They play a vital role in human and economic development. "The new center will help the younger generation design their own future, help them build their own international network and pave the route for high-income careers."he added.

Pakistan, SL to redouble trade to reach US $ 1 b goal
In order to invigorate efforts to reach the target of US $ 1 billion trade by 2018, it was agreed to redouble trade promotion efforts between Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
This was discussed at the Fifth Sri Lanka-Pakistan Foreign Office Consultations held on October 17 in Colombo, after a lapse of three years. Foreign Secretaries Prasad Kariyawasam and Tehmina Janjua of Sri Lanka and Pakistan respectively, co-chaired the meeting.
With regard to redoubling trade promotion efforts, the 2nd edition of the Pakistan Single Country Exhibition held in Colombo, and Sri Lankas participation consisting of a pavilion of 20 exhibitors at Expo Pakistan in November 2017 in Karachchi, with Guest Country Status, were discussed.
A wide range of issues reflecting the multifaceted nature of cooperation between the two countries, were discussed. This included trade and investment, tourism, science and technology, education, immigration, defence, sports, and ways and means to deepen bilateral relations and overcome impediments for further strengthening collaboration. The ongoing close cooperation between the parliamentarians of the two countries was noted as a means for further enhancing bilateral cooperation and people-to-people contact.
Investment opportunities available under the PakistanSri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (PSFTA) were explored, and issues that impede its maximum potential were discussed with a view to promoting more trade and investment under the provisions of the PSFTA. It was noted that the Advisory Committee established by the Sri LankaPakistan Business Council to study trade related issues under the PSFTA, and formulate a strategy to improve exports under the agreement is an appropriate and timely initiative.
Means to utilizing credit line facilities offered by Pakistan in priority projects in areas such as housing, livestock and science and technology were discussed as well.The ongoing close defence cooperation between the two countries, in particular, training requirements of the armed forces, was reviewed, for further strengthening.
Immigration procedures between the two countries were discussed with a view to streamlining processes to avoid bottle-necks and misuse.
It was agreed that the Joint Working Group (JWG) will meet soon with a view to assessing progress, and providing impetus to the implementation of MoUs/Agreements as well as other areas of cooperation including in education, sports, and in science and technology.
Foreign Secretary Janjua called on President Maithripala Sirisena on October 17, and on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on October 18.

Licence to operate three wheelers for those over 35 years only: Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva
It is compulsory that all three wheelers should be fitted with metres, while laws would be amended stipulating that only drivers over 35 years would be permitted to operate three wheelers on hire, said Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva in Parliament yesterday.
He made this statement during the debate on Regulations Under the Motor Traffic Act.
Presenting several proposals for the regulation of three wheelers, he said the sounds of these vehicles should not cause irritation to road users. If a commuter requires a bill for the ride, three wheeler drivers should provide it to them. We have implemented a mechanism to regulate the charges. Today, the trend is for a youth to get a three wheeler the moment he turns 18 years. This would be regulated in the near future and only those above the age of 35 years, would be permitted to operate three wheelers for hire. However, for those already in service, nothing could be done. Further, some three wheelers display various types of art and pictures on their three wheelers, causing distraction to other drivers. Hence, display of such unsuitable artwork should be avoided.
There is an increase in road accidents and these accidents could be contributed to the increase in accidents. From 2007 to 2016, there had been 366,167 road accidents recorded, while 25,624 deaths had occurred as a result. More people have died of road accidents than in the war. Accidents especially at railway crossings have notably increased, mainly due to reckless driving especially at railway crossings. Therefore, I propose to increase the fines to Rs. 25,000 for reckless driving at railway crossings.
There are over a million three wheelers in this country, while the roads are not equipped to handle such numbers. Hence, three wheelers entering the market need to be regulated. Further, the excess of three wheelers have caused many disputes, especially for parking and at taxi stands. The same goes for busses as well. Therefore, we intend to promote the import of environmentally friendly vehicles such as those operated electrically.
Meanwhile, Railway workers unions launched a strike last night over salary anomalies. They demanded that their salary scales be revised as MP 1 and 2. They discussed the issue with the Prime Ministers Secretary and also with us. The PMs Secretary notified the National Wages and Workers Commission to adjust their salaries as they wanted. However, the Wages and Workers Commission refused the request. Health unions have also demanded that their salaries be revised. There are practical issues in resolving these problems and these unions should understand this. The Deputy Minister is also discussing the issue with them. However, these are issues between the unions and how are we to resolve these
Therefore, I urge the railway workers to abandon the strike and return to work without derailing the public transportation services. During the last one day strike, Rs. 17 million was lost. The Railways Department runs at a loss of around Rs. 6,000 million annually. Hence, we will have to take firm decisions in order to regulate public transport, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
Prime Minister proposes Party Leaders' meeting to clear path for LG polls
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday in Parliament, proposed to hold a Party Leaders Meeting next week to sort out the remaining legislative issues and clear the path to hold the much delayed Local Government polls.
The Premier made this proposal when MEP Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena raised concerns over the possibility for LG polls to get delayed even beyond January, due to fresh legislative issues that had cropped up.
MP Gunawardena pointing out the relevant Gazette notification to facilitate LG elections, which was due to be held this week, has been further postponed and the Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry is to bring in another Amendment Bill to the Local Authorities Ordinance to rectify language discrepancies in the previous Amendment.
MP Gunawardena suggested going for a resolution in Parliament to rectify the existing technical issues, rather than presenting another Amendment. Nobody could challenge the validity of a Parliament resolution and therefore we could proceed fast and hold the LG elections, he said.
However, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya pointed out that the Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha was not agreeable to the proposal of moving a resolution. The Minister had consulted the AG who had said that an Amendment Bill was necessary for that purpose, he said.
The Prime Minister said Minister Musthapha is to present the necessary amendments to the next Cabinet meeting on Tuesday and that a Party Leaders Meeting could be scheduled after that to come to an agreement. I will also consult the Attorney Generals opinion over the matter. The issue over the Ambagamuwa and Kalmunai are also there. However, these would not necessarily delay the LG polls any further, the Prime Minister said.
Don't derail train service, warns Transport and Civil Aviation Minister
Transort and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva urging railway personnel avoid derailing the train service, warned that stern action would be taken if they did so. He said that due to such strikes, the public could take matters into their hands, which would turn into a dangerous situation.
The minister said so in Parliament yesterday, with regard to the railway services strike which commenced last night.
Although the reason for the strike was salary anomalies, destabilising the transport services of the country was unjust, the Minister said. Therefore he urged railway employees to call off the strike and return railway servives back on track and avoid inconveniencing the general public.

Gramashakthi:
Poverty eradication through village empowerment
The consensual government launched its most ambitious programme, Gramashakthi with the goal of poverty eradication by 2030 through empowerment of village. This is a programme that mobilizes the public sector and private sector together with active participation of the people. The programme combines learning from successful elements of all key poverty reduction programmes of the country as a national effort of all concerned to reach the sustainable development goals ending hunger poverty and halving all forms of poverty by the target year.
Sri Lanka has achieved impressive progress in extreme poverty reduction and the proportion of the population in poverty is down to 6.7%. However, the regional disparities range from 3% to 29% and the share of the total household income of the poorest 20% is 4.5% and it is 52.9% for the richest 20%. The bottom segment of 40% receives only 13.7%. Those whose income is closer to the poverty line run the risk of falling back due to shocks of climate or other unforeseen changes.
Despite certain progress, most of the factors causing poverty eradication difficult still continue in Sri Lanka. Dependency mentality expecting everything from the government cripples self esteem and discourage positive attitudes for innovations. Women although comprise 50% of the population are not adequately represented in decision making in resource allocation. Plans for community development are prepared by those who are less sensitive on the realities of the suffering of the poor and such plans imposed on them from the top become less effective. Savings of the poor are taken away to the urban centres and hardly reinvested to improve livelihoods of them or the place they live in. Access to capital is inadequate. The suffering of the poor 40% having difficulties to make ends meet in providing for the basic needs such as food, clothing, healthcare and education and with less for fulfilling the growing needs of the families and their children increase social unrest in already divided in the lines of race, religion, caste and political affiliations.
Resources for development
It has been well tested with positive outcomes in Sri Lanka that if information with required policy support, capital resources and decision making power on resource allocation are provided, communities would effectively use such resources for development. Poor families face difficulties in making strong investment decisions as individual households.
When such families are organised formally in inclusive and accountable institutions giving priority to the poor, to women and youth to collectively engage in overcoming poverty would be more effective. Also, it would allow such decision making going beyond decisions by simple majority to decisions guided by prior agreed and institutionally recognized set of values and principles creating simultaneously a prosperous economic person and a responsible, accountable and rights conscious person in the same individual.
Economic growth should be inclusive to benefit those who are left out of the markets and keeping away from benefiting and participating in the production of that growth. Interventions are needed to directly and positively affect the investment behaviour and interrelationships of individuals and enterprise in the micro economy through micro level economic institutions partnering with the organised private sector. The character and strength of the community platforms of the workforce is the basis for such inclusive growth. Gramashakthi movement aims to build such platforms for inclusive growth for poverty reduction.
The vision of Gramashakti is to strengthen, empower and formally organise Sri Lankan community actively towards the path to progress overcoming poverty. It aims at providing facilitation to people living in 5,000 Grama Niladhari Divisions to fulfill the basic needs and the growing needs individually and collectively by providing information, decision making power and resources by 2020 and contributing to reach the national sustainable development goal of eradicating extreme poverty and halving all forms of poverty by 2030.
Gramashakti methodology
 Building up economic organisations as peoples companies with legal acceptance following the accepted principles and core values of good governance in 700 Grama Niladhari Divisions (GND) in divisional secretariat division of the districts that are considered poorer in 2017.
 Declare a village development fund for the 700 divisions computed as Rs 8,000 per capita investment and release funds based on achieving milestones annually.
 Update legal status of existing 2,040 Gemidiriya organisations by the end of 2017 and help them institutionally join Gramashakthi movement.
 Cover 300 selected GNDs in improved supply/value chains of growth potential crops/products/services leading to exports or reducing imports through government, private and peoples sector partnering in micro economies with divisional secretariats as the central organising and coordination institution to increase coverage over 1000 GNDs by 2020.
 Cover all GNDs progressively to contribute to the achievement of the National goal of poverty free Sri Lanka by 2030.
The strategy:
 The operations will be undertaken through a three tear organisational mechanism comprised of Divisional Grmashakthi Operational Committee (DGOC) in each Divisional Secretariat, joint district and Provincial Gramashkthi Operational Committee (PGOC) in the 9 provinces and a National Gramashakthi Operational Committee (NGOC) at the presidential secretariat at national level. The NGOC will maintain a resource pool of experienced personnel on community driven development as a network to provide required services by the other committees.
 Capacity building support will be provided at all the three levels to the relevant stakeholders adopting community driven and collaborative development methodologies.
 Community organisations will be made to become inclusive and accountable economic institutions providing strong and credible platforms for converging various programmes and resources from public and private sector institutions to communities and to where they live.
 Access to capital will be provided mobilizing community savings and investments through micro finance.
 Strong communication strategy will be adopted efficiently and effectively to communicate right messages and feedback and sharing information among the stakeholders countrywide using information technology advancements available in the country.
It has been widely recognized that the respect to rule of law needs to be combined with respect to ethical existence by all citizens for sustainable development. By definition sustainable development requires resource use by the present generation without jeopardizing opportunity for the same for the future generation. The ethical dimension of respecting the humanity is clear.
Gramashakthi will mobilize communities to express willingness to follow rules before the communities are selected to join the movement. It is a precondition and a necessary part of self selection of a demand driven process.
The five non negotiable principles to follow in decisions are:
1. Inclusiveness  All households in a community has the right to join the organisation without any discrimination on race, religion, caste, creed or political affiliation
2. Equity  Priority to the poor, to the women and to youth
3. Transparency  Disclosing information
4. Accountability  Being answerable on decisions, actions and results
5. Cost sharing  community contribution to capital cost not depending fully on others

Removal of girl from school:
Principal has acted in an irresponsible manner: Minister
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam requested the Education Ministry Secretary for an investigation report on the removal of a girl from school accused of being pregnant.
The 15-year-old girl was removed from the school she was studying at Kekirawa by the Principal accusing her of being pregnant on a pre-judgment as she had been vomitting in school. However, medical tests carried out by the Dambulla acting JMO Gamini Senanayake had proved that the said girl was a virgin and not pregnant.
The Education Minister told the Daily News, that it has been observed that the principal had acted in an irresponsible manner. The Minister had later called for a report on this inhuman issue from the Education Ministry Secretary.
Principals and teachers should clearly understand that sacking a girl from schools was not the answer to any issue. Schools are meant to guide and direct students on the correct path, the Minister told the Daily News.
On a request of the Education Secretary, the Provincial Education Director has said that the services of the Principal would be suspended in due course on charges of irresponsible behaviour. Besides, a provincial level separate investigation was also being carried out into the case.

PM in pre-Budget Economic Policy Statement says:
PRUDENT DEBT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY TO OVERCOME FISCAL FRONT CHALLENGES
Over Rs.3,489 b required for debt servicing in next two years :
New Fiscal Management Responsibility Act soon :
Current debt rate to be reduced :
More than Rs.3,489 billion is required in the next two years for debt servicing, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday, also highlighting that the Government has put in place a prudent debt management strategy to overcome the unprecedented challenges in the fiscal front.
The Prime Minister making his pre-budget Economic Policy Statement for the third consecutive year, said in plain that the country has to pay Rs.1,974 billion in 2018 and Rs.1,515 billion in 2019 for public debt serving based on the outstanding debt as at end of August 2017.
Our target is to reduce the current debt which is 79.3 percent of the GDP to 70 percent of the GDP by 2020. We expect to maintain the budget deficit below 3.5 percent by then. We will strengthen the Fiscal Management Responsibility Act affirming our commitment towards fiscal consolidation, the Prime Minister explained.
The Premier said a new Fiscal Liability Management Act that provides legal framework for a prudent debt management strategy will be introduced shortly.
Our policies will be targeted on forward-looking liability management strategies. Accordingly, the funds required by the government will be raised with transparency and predictability, the Premier stated, while highlighting that a comprehensive secondary market trading platform and a liability management fund would be introduced shortly.
With reforms such as the new Inland Revenue Act, Foreign Exchange Act, Fiscal Liability Management Act, Corporate Intents of the State Owned Enterprises and close monetary-fiscal coordination, we will steer this country towards robust and judicious management of our financial resources and fiscal framework, the Prime Minster commented.
He told the House that the proposed Free Trade Agreements with Singapore, China, and India were making great progress, adding that those agreements would give a massive boost to the economy by opening huge new markets to our entrepreneurs.
The government will be formulating a trade adjustment package, said Premier Wickremesinghe, adding that the preliminary steps in that regard have been taken by enacting the Inland Revenue Act and the Foreign Exchange Act, and moving forward with the Anti-Dumping Bill.
We are also formulating a new National Export Strategy and a new National Trade Policy. The government is also establishing a National Single Window for Trade facilitation, and creating a new development bank for development financing with an export-import window, he noted.
The Premier also emphasised the need to attract more Foreign Direct Investment and Local Private Direct Investment in high-value products for the export-led economic strategy to be a success.
The Government has initiated investment climate reforms with the aim to raise Sri Lankas Ease of Doing Business ranking from 110 in 2017 to 70 by 2020, he pointed out.
The Premier also explained that the Government plans on initiating Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) to widen investment opportunities in the education, health, electricity, roads and highways sectors. Accordingly, the government will formulate a clear PPP policy with a well-defined legal, regulatory and institutional framework to attract private players with the requisite capacities. Potential areas for expanding PPP include healthcare, leisure, tourism, education, ports and aviation, transportation, highways, information and communication technology, and energy, he told the House.
Focusing on the private sector contribution to uplift the economy, Wickremesinghe said the effort of his government is to create an economy firmly based on foreign and domestic private investment, driven by a dynamic and forward - looking private sector.
The Premier, pointing out that the Government pursues a knowledge-based, highly competitive, social market economy, underlined the need to diversify our export basket to make this vision become a reality. For decades, we have relied on the same exports products such as garments, rubber, and tea. But now, we should diversify our exports by adding value added goods and services, he remarked.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe pledged that his Government would strive for increasing and improving jobs and raising incomes and expanding the middle class. The government is planning to formulate policies to have a balance between the needs of foreign employment and the domestic labour market. As the first step,labour shortages in the market will be filled. Foreign employment will be promoted only when the earnings are high and, only when the earning opportunities are available for skilled workers, the Prime Minister noted. The Premier, pointing out that 60 percent of the employed population is in informal and illegal economic activities, said that a contributory pension scheme would be introduced for those who are employed in the informal sector. This will result in minimizing the likelihood of poverty after retirement he added.
The PM also stressed the need to increase women participation in the labour market, and proposed to improve public transport, the private sector maternity benefits and access to tertiary and vocational education facilities.
Envisaging on building a strong economy, the Premier said, We are building a well-planned Expressway system from Hambanthota to Kandy. We have obtained funds for that. We started a joint venture in the Hambanthota Port this year. Discussions are being held to start a joint venture in Mattala Airport as well. We have started working on Hambanthota economic zone. Millaniya Trade Zone has been planned already. Wayamba Industrial Zone has also been planned. The constructions of those zones will commence next year. The construction of the first stage of the port city which will be developed as a Financial City is nearing completion. We will develop the Kandy City by joining hands with the Japanese government. India and Japan are extending their assistance to construct LNG plants. Tourism Zones in the Southern have been planned. Budget 2018 which will accelerate these programmes will be presented in Parliament next month. The Budget will provide the opportunity to extend the development which was limited to the Western Province, to all other provinces including the Southern, North-Western and Central Provinces.

PURSUING JUSTICE
One Tamil intellectual said Later, when the President and the Prime Minister formed Common Governance despite their political differences  my respect for Mr. Sirisena went up. It is not easy to maintain such a partnership in the current disorder in Sri Lanka.
When I read the following passages in the news paper articles, my respect for Mr. Sirisena went up many notches: it said - President Maithripala Sirisena took his security detail by surprise after he threw caution to the wind and abruptly alighted from his official vehicle to confront a group of protesters in Jaffna yesterday. The President was in Jaffna to inaugurate the National Tamil Language Day celebrations at the Jaffna Hindu College when the incident took place. If you stage protests against me and I am weakened, the devil will get an opportunity, President Maithripala Sirisena told a gathering in Jaffna yesterday. President Sirisena was heard as saying: Come let us discuss and see how the matter can be solved. The Tamils voted for me, you must remember.
Sivajilingam replied: So how do you pay back your gratitude to the people who supported you. Sivajilingam told the President that 160 Tamil prisoners held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) are languishing in prisons without trial. - Mr. Sivajilingam was defeated by Mr. Sirisena who has endured and continues to endure pain to remain in that marriage with a party that has been for a long time, the Political Opposition in his mind. My Energies are with Mr. Sirisena in this issue.
It was impressive from both sides as Tamils weeping and angry but not even word of abuse thrown to Sirisena. However, Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene insisted recently that prisoners kept under PTA cannot be released.
Hartal campaign in North
He reiterated that the remanded LTTE suspects, who had allegedly committed serious crimes, will not be freed without a judicial process despite the Hartal campaigns in the North and elsewhere. However it is not clear whether he meant the few who are charged with some evidence or the entire 158 Tamil prisoners who are kept under PTA; because many of them have only their confessions against them. The State Minister observed that the Hartal campaign in the North is politically motivated and a group seeking political mileage is behind it. Obviously keeping prisoners, years and years without formal charges, will automatically become serious political issue in a situation of nationality discrimination is involved.
Wijewardene made these observations speaking to the media after an event at a school in Biyagama. The State Minister pointed out that several TNA members are trying to disrupt the day-to-day life of the people in the North by organising a Hartal campaign. It is true that these prisoners have become political problem not only in the north but also in the south. They are prisoners accused of fighting for liberation of Tamil home land using violence and terror.
The Minister pointed out that there are no political prisoners as claimed by the TNA, explained that the investigations have revealed that those prisoners were involved in serious crimes during the time of war. That is not true; several of them are already accused of crimes against the state while others have not been charged so far. He noted that those prisoners could not be released without a judicial inquiry. If there are delays in the judicial process, those must be rectified. However the prisoners must go through the judicial process and either be convicted or released at the end of it, he said.
However Minister Rajitha did not agree with Wijewardene. Rajitha said Apart from those who face legal issues for their criminal activities, the government should take legal steps either to charge them or release them. The issue of political prisoners should be resolved once and for all. Health Minister Senaratnes remarks have come as the families of these prisoners stepped up their protest campaigns in the north and in the south demanding for the early release of their loved ones. Rajitha indicated The delay in releasing the Tamil political prisoners will seriously hamper the efforts for national reconciliation.
As a top Cabinet Minister he insisted that the government should act fast on releasing the Tamil political prisoners who are being held for several years without proper charges. The government has to take an urgent decision in this regard. They cannot keep these political prisoners forever, Cabinet Spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne told the media. Pointing out that similar political prisoners of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) were released under general amnesty after its 1971 and 1988 insurrections in the South, he said therefore, it is incumbent on the government to take a faster decision on the release of Tamil political prisoners.
Tamil political prisoners
Meanwhile, the Leader of the Opposition R. Sambanthan raised the issue of Tamil political prisoners in Parliament recently and demanded the government to take a flexible approach to this issue. He said although the Foreign Minister has given a pledge to the UN Human Rights High Commissioner to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), the Tamil political prisoners are still being held under this draconian law.
Only 19 people have been released in the past. Many others are still being held under the PTA despite many protests. How can the government detain them under the PTA when Foreign Minister himself is highly critical of it The PTA is against the law and we cannot accept any legal action under it, Sambanthan said. An unnecessary complication has been created by the transfer of some cases from Vavuniya to Anuradhapura. If witnesses needed protection, such protection could have been provided without the cases being transferred.
He very strongly urges that these Prisoners be released without any further delay.
At the same time Sambanthan the Leader of the Opposition wrote to President Sirisena on behalf of the above category of prisoners who have been agitating for their release for a long period of time. It said
I wish to state the following: 
l These persons are held in custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Law irrespective of whether they have been convicted, have been charged, or have not yet been charged. They have been arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Law and all action taken against them has been in terms of that Law.
l It has been accepted by the Sri Lankan State both domestically and internationally that the said Prevention of Terrorism Law is draconian, obnoxious, and should therefore be regarded as obsolete. The Sri Lankan State has made several commitments
l It has been accepted by the Sri Lankan State both domestically and internationally that the said Prevention of Terrorism Law is draconian, obnoxious, and should therefore be regarded as obsolete. The Sri Lankan State has made several commitments both domestically and internationally that the said Law will be repealed, and that a new Law will be enacted in keeping with acceptable domestic and international norms.
l The Sri Lankan State is yet to fulfill this commitment, but that does not derogate from the Sri Lanka States commitment that the said Law should not remain on the Statute Book.
l The only evidence available against most of these persons are confessions extracted from them against their will under the Prevention of Terrorism Law which would be inadmissible against them in normal Court of Law. Many of the cases have been postponed because the Prosecution is not ready to proceed with the Cases.
l Almost all of them have been in custody for very long periods of time, for as long as, they would have been sentenced, if sentence was passed on them shortly after being taken into custody.
l The families of these persons in custody have suffered for very long periods of time, without the support of their bread winners. This vitally important factor has not been given due consideration.
l Quite apart from the pernicious nature of the Prevention of Terrorism Law, persons in similar situations such as persons taken into custody during the insurrections of the J.V.P have been granted an Amnesty and released. It is not understood why the same principle cannot be applied in regard to these prisoners.
l These cases cannot be considered as coming purely under the purview of the Attorney Generals Department. With due respect to the Hon. Attorney General as the Chief Legal Adviser of the state, these cases have a certain political dimension and cannot be addressed as a purely legal issue. It can be justifiably stated that if the Sri Lankas national question had been reasonably addressed in time, many of the persons in custody, would not have been in their present position and would have been useful citizens. This circumstance makes it obligatory that you address this issue politically too. The issue not being addressed politically is a strong impediment to reconciliation and the restoration of goodwill and harmony.
l An unnecessary complication has been created by the transfer of some cases from Vavuniya to Anuradhapura. If witnesses needed protection, such protection could have been provided without the cases being transferred.
I have to very strongly urge that these Prisoners be released without any further delay.
The transfer of cases from Vavuniya to Anuradhapura raises the hilarious question whether Lanka got district wise divided judiciary, at Anuradhapura Dutu Gemunu judiciary while Vavuniya is still under Elara judiciary!

Losing streak continues with 11th ODI defeat on the trot:
Shell-shocked Sri Lanka slide to another defeat
SHARJAH, Friday  Despairing Sri Lanka were looking from where they can find an answer to plug the hole that is leaking out so many defeats for them in the ODI format as they slid to their eleventh consecutive loss when Pakistan beat them by seven wickets in the fourth match to take a 4-0 lead in the five-match series at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Friday. Even a change of venue to Sharjah that holds the world record for the most number of ODIs hosted at one venue in the Guinness Book Of World Records (227 matches) could not bring Sri Lanka that change of fortune despite the shorter boundaries in comparison to Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The only thing they won was the toss for the third time in four attempts and taking first lease of a flat Sharjah track full of runs made a royal mess of it succumbing to 173 all out in 43.4 overs.
Champions trophy champs Pakistan on a role continued their brilliant form by knocking off the required runs off 39 overs making 177 for three wickets with in-form Babar Azam and Shoaib Malik hitting solid half centuries in an unbroken fourth wicket stand of 119 off 152 balls.
Both batsmen finished on identical scores 69 not out with Babar using 101 balls (5 fours) for his seventh ODI fifty and Malik 81 balls (2 fours, 3 sixes) for his 41st ODI fifty.
Sri Lanka suffered from a common syndrome of losing wickets at the top and failing to last the quota of 50 overs. They were pushed onto the back foot right from the second over when debutant left-arm bowler Usman Shinwari bowled the in-form Sri Lankan skipper Upul Tharanga through the gate for a duck.
Within a matter of 11 overs Sri Lanka were four down for 72 and there was no fight back but a complete downslide. Where Sri Lanka perhaps missed out was during the Chandimal-Thirimanne liaison which ended in an awful run out of Chandimal (who was looking good) over a misunderstanding with both batsmen finding themselves at the same end.
Once again it was a one man show as it has been right throughout the series for Sri Lanka. On this occasion it was Lahiru Thirimanne who scored a resolute half century  62 off 94 balls - his second of the series and the fourth since his return to international cricket in August. He found no support coming from any of the other batters and this has been one of the main features of Sri Lankas failures - not being able to put together partnerships.
This Sri Lankan batting line up lacks players who can work the ball between gaps for singles and twos so that the scoreboard is always kept on the move and the bowlers are made to change their lines and lengths because the runs are leaking even though they are not coming in boundaries. Masters of that art were Aravinda de Silva and Arjuna Ranatunga and Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara. Sad to say this team simply doesnt have players of that class.
Hasan Ali proved why he is ranked the no. 1 ODI bowler in the world today picking up another three wickets for 37 runs getting breakthroughs for his captain whenever he was brought on.
No doubt this Pakistan attack has variety which no other nation has in one-day cricket today  right-arm and left-arm fast bowlers, off-spinners, leg-spinners and what have you. For a struggling team like Sri Lanka their depth in the bowling is too much to counter.
Sadeera Samarawickrama given his ODI cap by former Sri Lanka captain and present batting coach Hashan Tillakaratne at the start of the match commenced his ODI career with a second ball duck failing to read a delivery from Imad Wasim and being castled.
Samarawickrama was one of three changes Sri Lanka made for this match. He was flown into Sharjah as cover for injured Chamara Kapugedera who had a rather unfortunate accident when a ball lobbed towards him by Niroshan Dickwella during the 3rd ODI hit him in the right cheek. Although there was no fracture there was swelling.
Suranga Lakmal returned to the side after being rested for the third ODI and Seekkuge Prasanna was picked for his first game of the series. Jeffrey Vandersay and Dushmantha Chameera made way for them. Pakistan affected two changes leaving out Fahim Ashraf and Ruuman Raees for Usman Shinwari (debut) and Imad Wasim.
The fifth and final ODI will be played at the same venue on Monday.

## Title: SLFP shake up and polls rivalry ahead

SLFP shake up and polls rivalry ahead
The image of carrying on the fight against corruption will also need much more speedy legal action against those accused, charged with, or publicly known for fraud and corruption under the previous government. It also calls for stronger action against the agents or forces of corruption that remain within the present ruling coalition, especially those who came over to the Sirisena camp after General Election in August 2015, several of them after their own defeat as UPFA candidates from the SLFP, under Mahinda Rajapaksas leadership
The removal of key SLFP electoral organisers who are in the Rajapaksa camp has led to the biggest shake up in the party since it was established in 1951, and shows the move to major divided party contests in the coming elections to the local authorities, whenever they take place.
Of the two major democratic political parties in the country - the UNP and SLFP  the SLFP has had several breakaways, but never a clean up by the party leadership itself, as one sees today. There were breakaways from the party first led by CP de Silva, which defeated the Sirima Bandaranaike Government, and later the departure of Chandrika Kumaratunga to join her husband Vijaya Kumaratungas Sri Lanka Mahajana Party, and the breakaway of Anura Bandaranaike to join the UNP. It did not take very long for both Chandrika and Anura Bandaranaike to return to the party, then led by their mother. The major difference in the current move is that members are being removed by the party leadership, by party leader President Maithripala Sirisena himself, bringing to an end the efforts at party unity through political reconciliation between Mahinda Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirisena.
The members being removed have been key supporters of Mahinda Rajapaksa after his defeat by Sirisena in the January 2015 Presidential Poll, and also strong movers in the Joint Opposition, who have been seen as major oppositional activists to President Sirisena. Another aspect of importance is that several of those removed in the current move have been associated with and also charged under the law, on major issues of fraud and corruption. This is certainly a move, even though belated, to show that President Sirisena, as the party leader, is now giving more thought to the pledge given to fight corruption in his presidential bid against Mahinda Rajapaksa, and thus keep the public who opposed the corruption of the Rajapaksa regime with him.
The image of carrying on the fight against corruption will also need much more speedy legal action against those accused, charged with, or publicly known for fraud and corruption under the previous government. It also calls for stronger action against the agents or forces of corruption that remain within the present ruling coalition, especially those who came over to the Sirisena camp after General Election in August 2015, several of them after their own defeat as UPFA candidates from the SLFP, under Mahinda Rajapaksas leadership.
Poll delay
The present clean up the SLFP is certainly being expedited with the expected arrival of the Local Government polls, so far unofficially expected to be held in January 2018, but with new indications it will be further delayed, due to the change of electoral districts within the Nuwara Eliya District. This delay in the Local Government polls is certainly not helpful to the government, and the official SLFP led by President Sirisena, seen as yet another expression of the governments fear to face the people at the polls. The government, and especially the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils, have very little cause to justify this further poll delay, as the changes in electoral districts now being envisaged could very well have been done months ahead.
The fact that Minister Mano Ganeshan, leader of the Democratic Peoples Front and the Tamil Progressive Alliance is making this demand now shown as the cause for this delay. But there is no reason why these demands could not have been acted on earlier. This once again leads to a major opposition to the government over delays in the polls, where the Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils stands out as the political/administrative image of delayed polls.
A rival force
Whatever the polls delay, the clean up of the SLFP of forces ranged against President Sirisenas leadership, will lead to a rival force, other than the UNP challenging the SLFP at the local government polls. This will be the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), formally led by academic and Prof. G. L. Peiris, with his poor electoral record, but in fact led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, with his excellent record of electoral strategy, in more than forty years in politics. His defeat at the last presidential poll certainly moved him away from his role of party leadership, and electoral strategies. But, his leadership capabilities will certainly be challenged by President Sirisena holding the formal leadership of the SLFP, and being in a position to extend the required official support to the now electoral organisers he is appointing. There is no doubt that politics in Sri Lanka has much to do with the capabilities of those in power to manipulate politics. This was clearly seen in the near ten years of the Mahinda Rajapaksa presidency. The SLPP as the rival force to the SLFP and President Sirisena will certainly have to face this reality.
This situation, as well as the legality of a member of parliament having membership in a different party than what the member was elected from, is why Mahinda has still not announced his leadership of the SLPP. Instead, the organisational leadership has been given to his brother Basil Rajapaksa, who has already claimed the SLPP will win 200 councils in the coming local polls. Basils leadership, even temporary, is certainly not in the best interests of the SLPP. Firstly, it displays again the family bandyism of a Rajapaksa leadership. Next, it is no secret that Basil R is not much liked by members of the Joint Opposition, especially those in the SLFP there, who have clearly blamed BR for the defeat of MR in the presidential poll; and also the corruption allegations against BR are among the major contributors to the overall corruption charges against the Rajapaksa Regime. This will not help much in building up popular support for the SLPP with BRs organisational leadership.
Another issue that would threaten the position of the SLPP is the action the government would be taking against the forces of corruption of the last regime. The indications that new action would be taken to appoint special courts to expedite the indictment of those accused of fraud and corruption, and moves bring to book those apparently protected during the time of former Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, will certainly be a threat to the public appeal the SLPP expects to gain in the current political context. President Sirisena will certainly have to move ahead with the promised action against corruption, which may even be a big challenge to the UNP, for the current political clean up of the SLFP to bear the best results.
Constitution debate
As the parliamentary debate on the Steering Committee Report on proposed constitutional reform approaches, the debate on the report is getting much heated, but with little substance on the material of the debate. There is growing opposition thinking to the very idea of any constitutional changes, with the latest comment on this coming from the Joint Council of the Malwatta and Asgiriya Chapters of the Siyam Nikaya, stating the country does not need a new constitution. They also want the Executive Presidency to be continued, and expresses concerns that a new constitution may create divisions among communities.
This is largely supportive of the propaganda against the Steering Committee proposals which make it out as a draft of a new constitution, and not a report for public and parliamentary debate before any draft of a new constitution is prepared. The parties of the Joint Opposition are also in this position, and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has also taken the position that no new constitution is needed.
This is a major reversal from the public position which led to the election of President Sirisena in January 2015, and also the continuous demands for a new constitution, with clear removal of the Executive Presidency, that was supported by the SLFP, and its allies in the UPFA through more than the past decade, and the SLFP and the Peoples Alliance, for nearly a decade before that. The opposition to a new constitution is carried with allegations that the new proposals would lead to a federal state, with the possible division of the country in the future, and also a claim that the new proposals in the Steering Committee Report threaten the present position of Buddhism in the Constitution.
As the public debate, led by the political parties in the JO, sections of the Maha Sangha, and civil society and professions groups that have a largely majoritarian point of view on constitutional issues make headway, the government is certainly faced with a major issue of winning public support for any constitutional changes that could help in building a better democracy in the country. It will certainly need a much more active publicity and organisational support by the government to bring about a new constitution that the people voted for in January and August 2015.

SLFP will gain power by 2020: Amaraweera
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amarweera said his party will come into power in 2020 and they would contest general election as the UPFA.
The Minister was addressing a meeting at Tangalle recently.
He said they asked all UPFA organisers to work for the party but some of the SLFPers did not heed the party's instructions and even enrolled members to another party.
Those who were removed from organiser posts can once again join the party if they commit to party activities whole-heartedly, he said.
"A coalition regime would not come into power again because we intend to set up a regime of our own, the Minister said. He said a government could be formed with 113 seats. Selecting of candidates for the forthcoming elections was finished by 95 percent, the Minister said.
Minister Amaraweera said the SLFP has no crisis as a party. "It is a pure party led by its leader and President Mathripala Sirisena. We have selected candidates not involved in any corruption or malpractice," the Minister said.
He said a mud slinging campaign was going on in Hambantota district against him. Those who cannot tolerate my political progress sling mud at me, the Minister said.

Sri Lanka Army participates in Mitra Shakthi Exercise
The Sri Lankan Army contingent in India, participating in the Exercise Mitra Shakthi during the past few days, was able to learn Indian infantry tactics, weapon training, strategic approaches, etc. in addition to the active participation in mock situations.
Troops participating in the Exercise were taken on a familiarization tour in and around the AUNDH Cantonment and Indias Pune city where the Indian Armys Southern Command Headquarters is located, on Sunday.
The field visit was arranged by Exercise authorities of the Indian Army and all troops were divided into groups before they were accompanied by members of the Indian Army.
On the 6th day (Monday) of the Exercise Mitra Shakthi, troops rehearsed jungle lane firing and slithering in demarcated Exercise areas. After initial briefings, troops paddled across a lake to the starting point of the jungle lane. Troops were issued with safety gear and a paintball gun each for this purpose and the lane consisted of 16 targets. Sri Lankan troops succeeded in hitting all 16 to score during the Exercise.

Sri Lanka Economic Association Annual Sessions on Oct. 27, 28
The 2017 Annual Sessions of the Sri Lanka Economic Association (SLEA) will take place on October 27 and 28 under the theme, Modernization of Agriculture and Industry: Challenges for Sri Lanka. This marks the 31st successive year of the event, which gathers policymakers, public officials, academics, and economic researchers in Colombo.
The highlights of this years sessions include an inauguration ceremony conducted under the auspices of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the launch of a new book on economics titled, The Sri Lankan Economy: Charting a New Course, published by the Asian Development Bank.
Five technical sessions will be held focusing on a range of pertinent issues, from the commercialization of agri-business and challenges facing the agricultural sector, to the industrys evolution and current composition.
According to SLEA President Dr. Upananda Vidanapathirana, this years agricultural theme was chosen because stakeholders felt that it was time to address issues in the real sector, those that feel real and urgent to a larger swath of the population who might not otherwise concern themselves with economics. The previous themes for the annual sessions have included macroeconomics, public debt, and fiscal deficit.
The inauguration ceremony of the Annual Sessions will take place on October 27 at 4 pm, followed by a reception. The technical sessions will take place on October 28 from 8 am to 5.45 pm. All programmes on both days will be held at the auditorium of the Centre for Banking Studies at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in Rajagiriya.

Sri Lanka Women shot out for 69- lose first T20I
ANTIGUA, - A fine bowling performance from West Indies, keeping Sri Lanka to a mere 69 in 20 overs, gave them a 1-0 lead in the women's T20I series that began in Antigua on Thursday.
Mohammed finished with 2 for 14 and the even their most expensive bowler only conceded runs at 4.5 to the over. A total of 140 proved plenty more than enough.
The eventual margin of victory - 71 runs - was West Indies' third largest in T20Is with Sri Lanka matching their third-lowest total in T20Is.
Only two batsmen got into double-figures - Ama Kanchana making 18 off 21 balls at No. 3 and wicketkeeper Rebeca Vandort with 10 off 23 balls at No. 7.
The innings began to flag when Selman ripped out both openers in her first two overs. Chamari Atapattu, who was a sensation in the Women's ODI World Cup, was caught behind for 1 off the fifth ball of the chase and her partner Yasoda Mendis was lbw for a duck. Mohammed took out the middle order and soon Sri Lanka were 33 for 5 in the 12th over with no way out.
They managed to play out the full 20, making one run more than West Indies' Hayley Matthews (37) and her captain Stafanie Taylor (31). Late acceleration from the recalled Britney Cooper (20 off 11 balls) to lift the total from 106 for 4 to 140 in the space of19 balls almost seemed unnecessary.

## Title: A Strategy to Shrink Sri Lankas Debt

A Strategy to Shrink Sri Lankas Debt
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe while stressing a change in traditional approach of debt management, yesterday (19) said that the government has initiated a prudent debt management strategy.
Delivering the Economic Policy Statement for 2017 in Parliament yesterday, the Premier said the government has to pay more than Rs. 3489 billion in 2018 and 2019 for debt servicing. He added that the govt has been entrusted with the responsibility of building a country free from debt for the posterity.
Following is the Premiers full statement:
I take this opportunity to clarify the current status of the economy and the way forward for our government and people.
I emphasized the need for rebuilding the Sri Lankan Economy when I delivered the Economic Policy Statements in 2015 and 2016.
The challenge faced by us today is to sustain what we have built, and strengtheningthe economy. This task has two prongs. The first is to stabilise the economy creating a country free of debt for our future generations. The second is to expand the economy giving all Sri Lankans the chance for prosperity.
Strengthening and Expanding the Economy
We inherited a plagued economy. Since 2015, our government took a number of major steps to stabilise the economy. As I mentioned in the Economic Policy Statement last year, there is no use of holding the past responsible. We should try our best to go forward getting the past faults rectified.
Despite the reasons which are beyond our control and challenging domestic and global conditions, we were able to sustain a steady GDP growth rate of 4.4%. We were able to maintain the unemployment rate at 4.2% and to reduce the budget deficit to 5.4%.
Perhaps the most important thing is the change of our focus than the statistics. We focussed on a development based on tradable goods rather than developing on non-tradable goods. For years, the growth of the Economy of Sri Lanka was heavily reliant on huge public investments in infrastructure. Only the industries such as construction industry were strengthened by such investments. Concurrently, the exports share of the GDP of Sri Lanka was decreased gradually.
Managing the National Debt
We inherited the challenge of high debt with deficits in our current account balance and the government budget. Years of low government revenue paired with rigid expenditure flows led to financing the budget deficit from domestic and foreign borrowings.
In 2015, 90.6% of the government total revenue was spent for debt servicing. This amounted to 80% in 2016.
It is an urgent need to draw our attention on spending more than the revenue. We have initiated a process of fiscal consolidation based on revenue generation by passing the Inland Revenue Act, which is already yielding returns.
Public finances have been strengthened and revenue has increased as a percentage of GDP during the past two years. The ratio of revenue to GDP in 2016 increased to 14.2% from 11.4% in 2014. For the first six months of 2017, revenue to GDP now stands at 6.7% of GDP from 6% in the corresponding period in 2016. It is expected to reduce the current debt which is 79.3% of the GDP to 70% of GDP by 2020. We expect to maintain the budget deficit below 3.5% by then. We will strengthen the Fiscal Management Responsibility Act affirming our commitment towards fiscal consolidation.
In the midst of all these, we have many other challenges in 2018 and 2019 in terms of public debt management and fiscal consolidation.
The domestic debt portfolio mainly consists of Treasury Bonds. Around 30% of the Treasury Bonds will mature by 2019. Similarly, Sri Lanka Development Bonds, which is a USD denominated domestic debt instrument, worth of over USD 2.3 billion will mature by 2018. In addition, the composition of the foreign debt portfolio was also changed considerably. This change was occurred mainly due to the increase of mobilizing commercial loans such as the issuance of International Sovereign Bonds. We have to pay USD 1.5 billion in 2019 for maturities of International Sovereign Bonds. Further we have to pay annually thereafter.
When considering the public debt service payments based on the outstanding debt as at end of August 2017, we have to pay Rs. 1,974 billion in 2018. We will have to pay Rs. 1,515 billion in 2019. It means we have to pay more than Rs. 3,489 billion in 2018 and 2019 for debt servicing.
In order to overcome these unprecedented challenges, the government has initiated a prudent debt management strategy. Our traditional approaches to debt management will have to change to cope with new risks and structural and regulatory changes.
Our policies will be targeted on forward-looking liability management strategies. Accordingly, the funds required by the government will be raised with transparency and predictability. Under the medium  term debt management strategy, the detailed strategies of government borrowings will be known in advance to the domestic and foreign debt portfolios. In addition, we will introduce a comprehensive secondary market trading platform and a liability management fund. These reforms and future reforms will come into effect under the new Fiscal Liability Management Act that provides legal framework for a prudent debt management strategy.
The changes we have made by introducing the new Inland Revenue Act have been commended by the international community as well as domestic economic actors.
With the reforms such as the new Inland Revenue Act, Foreign Exchange Act, Fiscal Liability Management Act, Corporate Intents of the State Owned Enterprises and close monetary-fiscal coordination, we will steer this country towards robust and judicious management of our financial resources and fiscal framework.
Maintaining Low Inflation
Our government is taking a two-pronged approach to address the price stability.
We expect to provide the opportunity of buying the food items at a lower price throughout the year in order to control the short-term price fluctuations resulting in hardships to the people. We will improve the domestic supply chains and distribution networks to do so. In the meantime, we will allow importing of food products and other essential commodities at reasonable costs within the competitive market framework. We have reduced taxes on food commodities substantially over the past three months. We urge domestic wholesalers and retailers to pass the benefit of these reductions to the consumers.
However, the government will provide the space to the Central Bank to carry out its monetary policy independently to maintain price stability on a sustainable basis. The Central Bank is moving towards a new monetary policy framework targeting a flexible inflation. The aim of this framework is to maintain a low inflation continuously while supporting the economic activities. With this change of policy, our people will get the opportunity to live comfortably with the security of stable prices.
Development under Vision 2025
As we emphasised in the Vision 2025 document launched in September, we want to transform Sri Lanka into the hub of the Indian Ocean, safeguarded by a knowledge-based, highly competitive, social market economy. Our ambition is to make Sri Lanka a prosperous country by 2025.
For this vision to become a reality, our activities should join hands with the external world. Sri Lanka is a small island right in the middle of a large world. For thousands of years we have benefitted from being located strategically. Unfortunately, we seem to have forgotten this competitive advantage of the location. Our vision is to reclaim that mantle of international connectivity. In here, we have to leave behind the decades of inward-looking policies that shrouded our capacity to grow.
For this vision to become a reality, we must encourage the entrepreneurs to diversify our exports. From that, our export basket will be improved with diversity. For decades, we have relied on the same exports products such as garments, rubber, and tea. These have been the giants of our exports economy. But now, we should diversify our exports by adding value added goods and services.
And also, we should integrate into the producer  driven value chains. If we enable our domestic businesses especially small and medium enterprises to create linkages with the international value chains, we will be able to see immense leaps in productivity and profits.
Further, we must provide the opportunity for the private sector to drive growth and investments. We have relied on the public sector for too long ignoring the private sector. We have scared away private investments with unclear policies and complicated procedures for too long. The effort of our government is to create an economy firmly based on foreign and domestic private investment, driven by a dynamic and forward - looking private sector.
A 3-Year Economic Delivery Programme
To kick-start this transformation, we will implement a comprehensive economic strategy over the next three years.
We intend to raise per capita income to USD 5000 per year.
We hope to create one million new jobs.
Our target is to increase foreign direct investment to USD 5 billion per year.
We plan to double the exports to USD 20 billion per year.
Enriched and Empowered People
The goal of these development strategies is improving the lives of the average Sri Lankans. Thus we will strive for two basic economic outcomes:
Increasing and improving jobs.
Raising incomes and expanding the middle class.
For this, our crucial need is to enhance education and skill development to enable all citizens to contribute to a knowledge-based economy.
Unemployment rate among the youth, those who have passed GCE A/L, and females, estimated at 18.5%, 39.9% and 6.5%, respectively. This illustrates the current structural deficiencies in the domestic labour market and the issue of skills mismatch.
Recognizing these shortcomings, the government will be initiating a number of basic educational reforms. We will guarantee 13  years of education for everyone. After the GCE Ordinary Level examination, students will be directed to higher education, vocational education, jobs and training.
Furthermore, Information and Communication Technology, which is a need of the hour will be included in the school curriculum and the intake to universities in such disciplines will be increased.
This also aligns with governments broader objectives and effort towards a digitally empowered economy. This approach will provide the opportunity for the youth to engage in better jobs while getting their skills developed.
The Government will encourage the private sector to develop the skills of the market by investing on skills development and joining hands with the public  private sector initiatives. Recent estimates show that 23% of the population will be elderly by 2042. With the rapid increase of the aged population, skill development programs will also target older workers. And also, action will be taken to tackle the drop in productivity due to outdated skills.
The government is planning to formulate policies to have a balance between the needs of foreign employment and domestic labour market. As the first step, labour shortages in the market will be filled. Foreign employment will be promoted only when the earnings are high and, only when the earning opportunities are available for skilled workers.
With better working conditions such as improved public transport and flexible working conditions, there is a chance that Sri Lankans living abroad will actively contribute to the countrys growth process. We can expect their engagement for the development of our country and overall improvement in working conditions.
Currently, 60% of the employed population is engaged in informal and illegal economic activities. 40% of the employed population is engaged in vulnerable categories of jobs. We will take steps to uplift the standards of all jobs and to secure the social recognition and safety by providing internationally accepted certifications and licenses. This will result in minimizing the informal nature of the jobs. A contributory pension scheme will be introduced for those who are employed in the informal sector. This will result in minimizing the likelihood of poverty after retirement.
Trade and Tariff Reforms for the Growth of Export Targets
We were a trading nation since the era of ancient kings. Sri Lanka was the hub for transferring goods and knowledge from East to West, and West to East. We should learn from the history on exports and private sector growth which are key elements for becoming a higher middle-income economy.
People living in developed and developing East Asian and South East Asian countries such as China and Thailand have better jobs and higher living standards than the average Sri Lankans. I remember travelling to villages in these countries in 1979. They did not have many comforts or western foods enjoyed by Sri Lankans by then.
But today, the situation is different. How Sri Lanka lost its pace of development while other countries were progressing This is a question that we should ask from ourselves. They embraced open economic policies focused on exports. Meanwhile, we looked inwards and adopted closed policies. Therefore we missed 30 years of valuable opportunities.
As I said before, Sri Lankas exports are still based on traditional plantation crops together with apparels and tourism. We still compete for apparel with lower income economies resulting in pressure to keep our wages low. Still our biggest foreign exchange earner is foreign employment sector. Yet all these foreign exchange earnings are insufficient to meet our import bills. This lack of export growth contributes to the pressure on the balance of payments. This results in the depreciation of rupee and affects the prices of goods.
On the other hand, other middle-income countries such as Thailand and Vietnam are exporting a more diversified range of high-value products such as automobile parts, machinery and electronics. They are leaving us behind. We will have to catch up to our competitors. We have to change all these things if we are to strengthen the economy and to create more jobs.
We have obtained good results from the steps we have taken to stabilise the economy. Therefore, we should now focus on adopting an export-led economical growth strategies and policies by providing high-value and diversified products and services.
A key part of this policy will be entering into Free Trade Agreements with partner countries around the world. We are making great progress towards mutually beneficial Free Trade Agreements with Singapore, China, and India. These deals will give our economy a massive boost by opening huge new markets to our entrepreneurs.
We must ensure that both local manufacturers and export manufacturers are competitive through this export-led strategy. Businesses may have to restructure focusing on which aspects make them competitive. Only then Sri Lanka will become a highly competitive economy.
To ensure a smooth transition for these companies, the government will be formulating a trade adjustment package. We have already taken steps in that regard, enacting the Inland Revenue Act and the Foreign Exchange Act, and moving forward with the Anti-Dumping Bill. We are also formulating a new National Export Strategy and a new National Trade Policy. The government is also establishing a National Single Window for Trade facilitation, and creating a new development bank for development financing with an export-import window.
Strengthening our Capacity for Growth
For our export-led economic strategy to be a success, we must target and obtain much more Foreign Direct Investment and Local Private Direct Investment in high-value products. Foreign Direct Investments have been the engine of growth for East Asia and South East Asia, and Sri Lanka can certainly attract similar or higher levels of investments.
For this, it is essential that we improve the investment climate. We should push Sri Lanka to top positions in relevant global indicators.
We will simplify the hurdles that investors currently face in dealing with the large number of government agencies. The reform agenda and an organizational setup focusing on implementation and continuous review of progress are already in place.
We launched the eight-fold action plan on Investment Climate Reforms in July 2017. It was developed following in-depth key stakeholder consultations to understand the obstacles faced by business owners and investors. This engaging and transparent approach is the key to success of the reforms. We will contribute to raising Sri Lankas Ease of Doing Business ranking from 110 in 2017 to 70 by 2020.
Additionally, steps are being taken to establish a Single Window for new business registration that brings more than 20 government agencies together.
Comprehensive Industrial Strategies
Moreover, we will implement a comprehensive industrialization strategy that connects manufacturing with other sectors. Since economic liberalization in 1978, our progress in human development aspects have been on par with advanced economies. Yet our industries have declined.
The contribution of industrial activities and the manufacturing sector to economic growth has remained stagnant during the last two decades. Industrial activities contributed 27.6% of GDP in 2000 and only 29.7% in 2016. Inability to remain competitive, lack of value addition and lack of sophisticated technology are the main reasons for this situation.
We will revitalise the manufacturing sector by introducing a clearly defined industrialisation strategy.
Promotion of Tourism
In 2016, we have attracted more than 2 million international visitors generating an estimated revenue of USD 3.5 billion. The industry provided 320,000 local jobs in 2015. In the coming years, we will strengthen the tourism sector so that we can work towards our goal of attracting five million tourists to Sri Lanka every year.
Massive resort hotels dominated our tourism sector in the past. But current research shows that 90% of Sri Lankas hotels have less than 10 rooms. This is an Airbnb economy. This is an economy where every individual with a spare room has the capacity to earn cash. We will streamline the informal sector and ensure the quality and standards.
Tourists are not just coming to Sri Lanka for the standard hotel holiday. Therefore, the government will take steps to develop tourist attractions. Sri Lanka will be made a destination where tourists should come for unique experiences. Travellers have focussed on a number of sectors such as our culture, cuisine, traditions, wildlife, Ayurveda and meditation.
The contribution of all stakeholders in the public and private sectors is required to boost the tourist attraction. 4-year tourism development strategy which was prepared consulting all relevant stakeholders will provide the base to achieve the tourism vision 2025.
China and India are our biggest and most rapidly expanding markets. We must shift our tourism strategies accordingly. We have to expand our connections with the countries from which the well-spending tourists are coming. We have to liberalise access to sea and air services. Therefore, action will be taken to develop air access domestically and internationally, while facilitating cruise services and the establishment of yacht marinas.
Improving Opportunities for Housing
With all our focus on growth, we have certainly not forgotten the fundamental needs of our people. Our goal is to provide shelter for all in 2025.
The government is drafting a new national housing policy built on three key features. First, the policy is a people centric policy. People will engage in decision-making, actions, and responsibilities. Secondly, we are going to pursue integrated and inclusive urban housing development. Thirdly, we will ensure that housing development is sustainable.
We have allocated Rs. 75 billion to the National Savings Bank to provide housing loans at concessionary rates, and we have allocated Rs. 75 billion for the urban regeneration programme and other housing programmes.
The government will not act as the sole owner. The government will act as a delegated authority. The government will play the central role in setting the framework for housing development, but a lesser role in providing investment. We will enable the people and private sector to take control of investing on housing.
Market-driven Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)
We recognise the need for sustainable investments in socio-economic infrastructure such as education, health, electricity, roads and highways. It will contribute to Sri Lankas rapid transition into a middle-income country. Our aim is to utilize PPP to gap these investment opportunities.
Accordingly, the government will formulate a clear PPP policy with a well-defined legal, regulatory and institutional framework to attract private players with the requisite capacities. Potential areas for expanding PPP include healthcare, leisure, tourism, education, ports and aviation, transportation, highways, information and communication technology, and energy. We will prioritize expanding opportunities for alternate financing to support PPP programmes.
Strengthening Public  Private Partnerships in the Agriculture sector
We hope to harness the power and energy of PPPs to improve efficiency and productivity of agriculture. The agriculture sector is saddled with major issues such as low productivity, lack of diversification, inefficiency in water management, and poor management of weather disruptions. Weaknesses in the sector contribute to food insecurity and regional poverty.
We will revitalise this sector through investments in agricultural research, extension services, water resources, and infrastructure facilities. We will facilitate the shift from traditional low value to modern high value agriculture. We will encourage scientific farming, promote agro-based industries and initiate commercial agriculture with the participation of farmer organisations and the private sector.
We will encourage the small and medium scale agri-businesses to invest in commercial agriculture and value chains through the agriculture modernization project. Further, we hope to see the modernization in the plantation sector.
The government will also promote information and technology enabled agricultural extension services to farmers by encouraging mobile phone-based services. This will turn the farmers who are depending on the subsidies into agro-businessmen.
Supporting SMEs through Swashakthi
Another key feature of our support for the small businessman is the Swashakthi loan scheme. The government launched Swashakthi with the intention of supporting small and medium scale entrepreneurs to start self-employment projects and industries to strengthen the village economy. We have seen high demand for this scheme. That means we have deep wells of entrepreneurial capacity just waiting to be tapped. We will extend this scheme further to support the entrepreneurial skills and ideas of the youth.
We are in the process of launching several new schemes to support technology based SMEs. In order to improve the efficiency of government loan schemes and refinance schemes, we will also continue efforts to consolidate such schemes. We urge financial institutions to keep intermediation costs low, so that the whole country can benefit from reasonable interest rates on loans.
Empowering Women
We aim to create an environment where all citizens have the opportunity to achieve higher incomes and better standards of living. Therefore one of our main priorities is creating safe working conditions for women.
Women participation in the labour market remains low in Sri Lanka compared with majority of advanced and emerging market economies and the region. The present Women Labour Force Participation Rate is less than half of that of males, lingering around 30% - 35% since 1990s. This participation is not enough to sustain the high growth momentum of the economy.
We should improve the public transport systems enabling women to travel comfortably to their workplaces. We are introducing the Light Rail Transit (LRT) with this purpose. This will greatly ease the current passenger congestion and provide a convenient and a safe mode of transport.
Furthermore, the National Child Day Care Centre Guidelines as already approved by the Cabinet will assist in creating more affordable and transparent childcare centres across the island. People will have the opportunity of obtaining their services at a reasonable rate.
Archaic labour laws which restrict females from effectively participating in the labour force, contribute to lower participation and lower productivity levels. Therefore, the government is committed to introduce new legislation. The present situation in the private sector on maternity benefits and access to tertiary and vocational education facilities will be improved.
We will encourage and strengthen the Small and Medium Enterprises. Women can play a major role in these enterprises.
Building a Stronger Economy
A number of projects which accelerate our journey towards a stronger economy are being implemented. We are building a well-planned expressway system from Hambanthota to Kandy. We have obtained funds for that. We started a joint venture in Hambanthota Port this year. Discussions are being held to start a joint venture in Mattala Airport as well. We have started working on Hambanthota economic zone. Millaniya Trade Zone has been planned already. Wayamba Industrial Zone has also been planned. The constructions of those zones will commence next year.
The construction of the first stage of the Port City which will be developed as a Financial City is nearing completion. We will develop the Kandy City by joining hands with the Japanese government. India and Japan are extending their assistance to construct LNG plants. Tourism Zones in the Southern have been planned. Acquisition of lands is taking place now. We will start working on tourism zones in Iranavila and the Eastern Province soon.
The Budget 2018 which will accelerate these programmes will be presented in Parliament next month. The Budget will provide the opportunity to extend the development which was limited to the Western Province, to all over including Southern, North-Western and Central Provinces.
Those who can develop with skills and effort will be encouraged by the Budget. Others will also be supported.
This is a very challenging journey towards prosperity. This is a plan to enrich the country by 2025. This is an effort to make Sri Lanka again, the economy and trade hub of the Indian Ocean. I urge all of you to join hands with me in this challenging journey towards prospering our motherland.

The Super-powered brains of F1 drivers
If you want to get ahead on the Formula Onegrid it turns out you need to be a cognitive "super performer."
Making split decisions at high speed again and again, F1 drivers' brains are working overtime to deal with the extreme demands of one of the world's most pressurized sports, according to performance scientist James Hewitt, who works at Hintsa Performance -- a company working in the area of "human high-performance."
"I'm really interested in super performers, people who exhibit particularly high levels of cognitive capabilities, maybe an ability to sustain their attention to a much greater degree than you see in the average population," Hewitt, who is head of science and innovation at Hintsa, told CNN's The Circuit.
"It's the integration of these different cognitive capabilities -- many residing in the front of the brain in the frontal cortex -- that define what I would call super performers," added Hewitt. "We see many of these in Formula One."
For drivers like Romain Grosjean of the Haas F1 Team, it's not just the stress of 20 grands prix a season his brain has to contend with.

Teacher transfers should be carried out promptly, smoothly: Minister
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that the teacher transfer programme should be carried out promptly and smoothly without any obstacle.
He made these remarks while speaking on the Education Ministrys policy decision to transfer all teachers who had completed ten years service at the same National School. According to Education Ministry sources, certain teachers have been serving at the same National School for many years refusing transfers.
The Minister said that relevant authorities have been instructed to carry out the teacher transfer policy decision without any obstacle as the decision was taken for the betterment of the students.
However, it has been reported that certain teachers are trying to hamper this transfer process by arousing students and past pupils by levelling allegations that the education of the particular school would be affected once they are transferred.
Responding to such allegations, Education Ministry sources said that the proposed transferring process would be carried out promptly and efficiently without considering such negative influencing.

Thera with two IDs arrested
Ven. Arambepola Rathanasara Thera who was sought in the case for threatening Myanmar refugees located in a UNHRC facility in Mount Lavinia was arrested by a special police team yesterday.
The suspect who was dodging the police for several weeks was taken in to custody along with two National Identity Cards in possession.
One of the two NICs was issued to Rathanasara Thera presenting him as a lay person and the other as a clergy. Accordingly, one NIC has been issued on December 9, 2011, which says Rathanasara Thera was born in 05.12.1992 and resided at 226, Purwaramaya Road, Kirulapone, Colombo 05. The other NIC says that the ID holder is Thennakoon Mudiyanselage Chamara Thennakoon, born on the same birth day, resided at Dhoowa Temple Road, Kaluthara South. This NIC has been issued in 05 July 2017.
A few days back, Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara introduced two mobile phone numbers to the public through which the IGP could be directly contacted. A passenger has called one of these numbers (0718591902) and informed that Rathanasara Thera was traveling in a bus from Kandy to Colombo.
IGP Jayasundara has immediately deployed a special Police team to take Rathanasara Thera in to custody. Following preliminary questioning, Rathanasara Thera had confessed to having two NICs. The Police is investigating on certain incidents where Rathanasara Thera may have used the fake identity card.
The Police is also looking into the possibility of Rathanasara Thera getting passports allegedly using the fake ID and any involvement in crime using the said documents.
Police Media Spokesman Superintendent of Police, Attorney at Law Ruwan Gunasekara said the Colombo Crime Division will continue questioning the Rathanasara Thera with regards to who prepared the fake documents on behalf of the Thera.
The Thera was to be produced before the Mount Lavinia Magistrate yesterday.
