GMOA to continue protest against SAITM
We will continue to protest against SAITM until our demands are met by the government. Threats are not going to stop the strike launched by GMOA, GMOA Spokesperson Dr. Navin De Soysa said.
The GMOA claimed that their strike was a success and said that the strike would end at 8 a.m. today. The progress of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) cannot be hindered by threats and suppression, GMOA Spokesperson Dr. Navin De Soysa said.
Dr. Soysa said that they have not complicated their demands with politics unlike some other trade unions and added that only the trade unions that have unbiased demands joined hands with the GMOA.

I could never bring myself to ask my mum: Why did you leave me as a kid
World Snooker champion Mark Selby:
Here is a quote from the Leicester-born philosophical writer James Allen in his book As a Man Thinketh at the outset of the 20th century that appears to sum up perfectly the harrowing ordeal that darkened the door of Leicester-born and bred snooker player Mark Selby by the end of it.
Selbys mother abandoned him at the age of eight, and his father died of cancer when he was 16 before he became a world champion at the age of 30.
During his rise to the apex of his profession at Sheffields Crucible Theatre a year ago, Selby never abandoned hope. During his bleakest hour on the cusp of the new millennium, hope never walked out on Selby. As a Man Thinketh As a Mark thinketh, in this particular case. Rather than wallowing in self-pity, drink and drugs to blot out the pain of such despairing loss, the young Selby got high on hours and hours of practice.
His resolve, fortitude and an innate willingness to never give up make his accomplishment in hoisting snookers biggest prize above his head by usurping Ronnie O'Sullivan last May one of the more astonishing sporting feats of our times.
Selby is a classic example of working class lad made good. He is an affable, well-mannered and courteous chap. He has had good breeding despite seeing his childhood and formative years vandalised by a series of unfortunate events.
Bookmaker Fred Done, owner of the World Championship title sponsor Betfred, gave Selby a fatherly tap on the arm the other day as he revealed his pride in clamping himself to a tournament that attracts over 300 million viewers worldwide.
Snooker's image is in safe hands with men like Selby promoting the sport. "My dad never forced me to become a snooker player," says Selby. He was happy if I was happy.
"He seen I was happiest playing snooker. And he said he would support me if that was my goal. Or if I decided I was fed up with it and wanted to do something else, he would have been as happy.  Selby successfully defended his title he won for the first time a year ago. John Parrott, the 1991 world champion, described Selby as granite when he recovered from 10-5 behind before rendering the games finest player OSullivan impotent in what wound up as a quite remarkable but ultimately resounding 18-14 triumph. Around the time Parrott was snagging his first title at the Crucible, Selby was forced to watch his parents split up, and his mother Shirley abandon him and the family home. He has not seen or spoken to her since.
In 1999, the year Stephen Hendry was winning his record seventh title in Sheffield, Selbys dad David, a figure he describes as his true inspiration, died of cancer. It cut a darker outlook in his world than all the lights going out at the local snooker hall. Ive not seen my mum for many years. She still lives in Leicester, but Im not really in contact with her, explains Selby.
I have one brother. He sees her more than myself. He passes on messages and stuff, but there is not any prospect of reconciliation. I dont see her as such.
"It is tough, but Im quite a stubborn person, and she left me when I was younger.
Im at the stage that unless she comes to me, I feel that I dont really owe her that much to go back to her and say to her: Why did you leave
She left me. I feel as though until she comes to me and speaks to me, that is the only way it could be rekindled. The conservative feel to the RAC club in Pall Mall in London where we are speaking, an outpost where access is denied without donning a tie even if you look like you have been dragged through a hedge, is a million miles away from the New Parks area of Leicester where Selby was brought up. His old house is more Jeremy Kyle than Jeremy Clarkson. Selby lives in a pile in the countryside with a swimming pool ("I swim depths rather than lengths," Mark joked) with wife Vikki and newly arrived baby daughter Sofia Maria, but often revisits the area where he endured the heartbreak of his mother leaving.
It reminds him never to forget his roots yet solitude in bleak house has provided Selby with a voracious appetite to prosper. He entered the Crucible as world number one having recently snared the German Masters and China Open. He became the first first-time winner to defend the world title, Hendry, OSullivan or Steve Davis never managed it, but such a feat would not better the 12 months gone past.
He became a dad for the first time in November - yet the pain of his formative years will never truly clear when snooker must have been a crying game.
It does affect me a little bit because you only have one mum, says Selby. With my father not here..but at the same time, Ive lived that long now, I would never wish any harm to her. Its your mum after all and it is all a bit strange, but I have my own family with Vikki and young Sofia. Ill just carry on with life.
Selby is stocked up with life skills on what it takes to be a good parent. He promised his dad that he would win the world title when his father made his last request on a death bed. His dad was diagnosed with cancer in the September before passing away at the end of October.
My dad introduced me to the game, and took me around the country when I was a junior to all the tournaments, says Selby. He worked day in and day out to earn as much money as possible. All he was doing was spending all the money on me to fund my career to give me the best chance in life. I respect everything he did for me.
"I promised him Id win the world title for him, and even today he is still with me. He continues to inspire me."
At eight or nine he went to practice at his dads local social club. After a year or two, the club banned him because some members were bemused about losing to a kid.
I wasnt allowed there being under 18 [due to alcohol licensing laws]," Selby explained. "The committee then said I was allowed to go in and play on a Saturday for two or three hours, but as I got better I started to beat a few of the locals.
"I was knocking them off and it was winner stays on. I think they put a complaint in, and stopped me playing there which was a bit of a sour moment as my dad had been there for many years as a member.
"It was funny because about 10 years later I won my first tournament. They got in contact to ask I would do an exhibition there. I denied it on a point of principle just because of what they had done to me at the time. That was a shame.
Malcolm Thorne, the late brother of the Leicester professional and snooker pundit Willie Thorne, saw potential in the aspiring Selby when Willie had his career mapped out as a journeyman. He offered him free practice sessions at his club, and funded his participation in tournaments.
Selby was an 8-1 shot to win back-to-back trophies simply because the snooker rules decreed that it has never occurred since the sport became a TV spectacle in the 1970s.
O'Sullivan has been partaking in pugilistic sparring sessions ahead of the showpiece tournament, but would probably rather get knocked out in a boxing ring than having to sit through another best-of-35 frame joust with Selby.
If OSullivan is snookers superman, Selby possesses the kryptonite to unseat him. There is a natural enmity and sporting tension between the two men. Coming from a player who has collected 685,866 in prize money alone over the past two seasons, Selby cannot understand OSullivans complaint that there is not enough cash to go around. The World Championship has a prize pot of 1,214,000 million and a 300,000 cheque for the winner.
Ronnie comes out with some statements that I think you have to laugh off, smiles Selby. Whether he does it to get the media talking, I don't know.
"We almost never had a snooker tour a few years ago. There is plenty of money in the game. I can't really see where Ronnie is coming from.
OSullivan somewhat churlishly compared Selby to the renowned Cliff The Grinder Thorburn after last years final, irate that he was suffocated by the sheer bloody-mindness of the bloke opposite him. But it is fairly bogus to compare Selby to the Canadian. When Thorburn picked up the old pot in 1980, there were 10 centuries recorded at the Crucible. The highest total of 83 was recorded in 2009, and 58 last year. Selby is more like a Steve Davis of the modern era.
Selby is known as the Jester because the word rhymes with Leicester, and perhaps also because of the dash of light-hearted irony when it comes to such a mild-mannered chap. It is as a misleading moniker as suggesting he is a slow player simply because he peforms at a less ferocious pace than OSullivan.
While the Rocket played on a full-size table at the family home as a kid, Selby was being tossed out of a social club for being too good. But Selby's mantra dictates that you should never give up. Never give in.
Selby continues to practise six hours a day and cites the darts champion Phil Taylor, 54, as an example of what practice can achieve. With OSullivan, 39, favourite for this event, Selby hopes he can have another decade of trying to at least double his lot at the Crucible.
Hendrys won his last world title at the age of 29. If you stay fit and focused, Id like to think I have another 10 good years left in me. This is an exciting time for the sport."Leicester-born philosophical writer Allen, no forefather of snookers Mark 'The Pistol' Allen, penned back in 1903: In all human affairs there are efforts, and there are results, and the strength of the effort is the measure of the result.
In snooker, hours of devotion to potting and plotting success produces results for men like Mark Selby.
But there is a greater wisdom at work, perhaps sent from a higher power, in Selby's commendable survival instincts that are worth noting as we all strive to discover a better place.  Eurosport

Radical proposal recommends rewriting world records
It is a proposal which has been described as cowardly by one former athlete, but as a step in a right direction by the most powerful man in athletics.
In a revolutionary new proposal, European Athletics has recommended that all track and field world and European records set before 2005 should be removed from the record books.
It would mean Mike Powells long jump world record, Florence Griffith-Joyners 100-meter and 200 -meter world records and Britains Paula Radcliffes marathon world record would be scrapped.
Usain Bolts world records, set after 2005, would still stand.
Radcliffe, who set her world record of two hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds in 2003, described the proposal in a statement as cowardly and said that it would damage her reputation and dignity.
But Seb Coe, president of the sports governing body -- the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) -- told reporters the report was a step in the right direction.
He added: If organized and structured properly we have a good chance of winning back credibility in this area.
CLOUD OF DOUBT HUNG OVER RECORDS FOR TOO LONG
European Athletics Council accepted the proposals of the taskforce set up in January to look at the credibility of world records. It is a response to the McLaren report which uncovered widespread doping in sport, with track and field particularly affected.
Svein Arne Hansen, European Athletics president, told reporters that records were meaningless if people dont really believe in them.
Under the proposals, world and European records would only be recognized if certain criteria were met:
+Records would have to have been achieved at international events where the highest standards of officiating and technical equipment could be guaranteed.
+The athlete must be subject to an agreed number of doping control tests in the months leading up to the record.
+Doping control samples taken after world-record performances would need to be stored and available for retesting for 10 years.
The IAAF has stored blood and urine samples only since 2005. Current records which do not meet the above criteria would remain on the all-time list but would not be officially recognized as records.
Its a radical solution for sure, but those of us who love athletics are tired of the cloud of doubt and innuendo that has hung over our records for too long, said Hansen. We need decisive action to restore credibility and trust.
This will now go to the IAAF Council Meeting in August and on behalf of European Athletics I will be encouraging them to adopt this proposal.  CNN

ADB provides $31.7 b assistance in 2016
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided $31.7 billion in total assistance in 2016.
The ADB approved $17.5 billion in financing in 2016 from its own resources and attracted $13.9 billion in co-financing, both new highs. It also disbursed $12.48 billion, another record.
The institution also surpassed its target for public-private partnerships, supporting 58 transactions during the 2013-2016 period and outperforming the target of 50.
ADB has thus delivered its goal to increase development finance to the Asia and Pacific region, achieving most of its development and operational targets in the 4-year period 2013-16.
The 2016 Development Effectiveness Review (DEfR) was released in Yokohama,Japan at the 50th Annual Meeting of ADBs Board of Governors. The report measures how well ADB is executing its corporate strategy, Strategy 2020, and the strategic priorities of the midterm review of the strategy across 91 results indicators.
The ADB is delivering on its commitment to helping the Asia and Pacific region reduce poverty and achieve more inclusive and sustainable growth, said the ADBs Strategy and Policy Department Director General Indu Bhushan.
The ADB will continue streamlining its operations so that it can deliver development solutions more quickly and effectively, while continuing to scale up finance for the region.
The ADB met or surpassed 62% of the targets for development results and operational and organizational effectiveness. The report is the fourth and final report under the 2013-16 results framework.
Among the reports main findings are that ADBs climate change mitigation and energy projects, including renewable energy, achieved 100% of their intended outputs in 2016.
Nearly half of all ADB projects supported climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts.
During the 2013-16 period, ADB financed the building and upgrading of 34,000 kilometres (km) of roads and 1,400 km of railways, the installation of 13 gigawatts of new power generation capacity, a third being renewable, and grid connection of 692,000 households. New or improved water supply reached 3 million households, while 5.7 million people  40% of whom are womenbenefited from improved availability of financial services. More than 2 million teachers were trained. Nearly three quarters of projects achieved ADBs targets for gender mainstreaming, a measure that assesses the extent to which projects integrate gender issues.
To address these challenges,the ADB is implementing a transitional results framework for 2017-2020 as the bank continues to prepare a new corporate results framework aligned with Strategy 2030  ADBs new long-term strategic plan which is currently being developed. The efforts are being made to boost project readiness, minimise delays, improve efficiency, and raise overall success rates through a second generation of procurement reforms. Steps are also being taken to raise womens representation among international staff and optimize human resources for a stronger, better, and faster ADB.
ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Established in 1966, ADB is celebrating 50 years of development partnership in the region. It is owned by 67 members 48 from the region.

Ajit Wadekar architect of Indian crickets renaissance
Indian soil did indeed produce a galaxy of cricketing stars from the moment they trooped on to the Test arena in 1932 - individual brilliance though, provided by such immortal willow wielders such as Merchant, Modi, Mankad, Pataudi Sr, Mustaq Ali, Amarnath and Hazare among others - yet literally they never ever produced a cohesive match winning unit, never a comprehensive series win across the vast horizon - just a couple of Test wins, so few and far between, through the thirties and well into the nineteen sixties.
Paradigm shift it took one Ajit Laxman Wadekar with his can do - gung ho Maharastrian mindset to herald the dawn of Indian crickets winnings ways. Initially thrashing Gary Sobers maroon caps off their pedestal so to speak, in the Caribbean mind you, in 1971, and then bulldozing the English, first in Old Blighty in 1971, and repeating the feat in the sub continent in 72-73 for good measure.
It was Vijay Mechant, the Indian selector-in-chief who had virtually grabbed the baton from the much fancied, aristocratic, entrenched-in-the-captaincy, Nawab of Pataudi jnr and handed it over to Ajit Wadekar in somewhat controversial circumstances.
On hindsight it was a truly worthwhile gamble was it not. That Ajit Wadekars grasp of the grass-root issues and nuances of the game deserved much wider respect, was the astute Merchants view.
With a wounded tiger licking his wounded pride in the vicinity of his principality in Haryana or thereabouts, Wadekar took it upon his slender young shoulders therein to marshall his somewhat inexperienced cricketing troops, what with his scholarly authority and quiet charm, towards winning ways, the side replete with green sprigs such as Gavaskar, Solkar, Abid Ali, Kirmani, Ashok Mankad, Govindaraj among others.
Remember his beloved Tricolor was wallowing at the bottom of Test crickets heap alongside New Zealand at that particular point of time, the whipping boys of the international game, so to speak. Bats over Books to kick of the narrative from its very conception, with Ajits scholarly dad Laxman Bhassar having every stoic intention of guiding his left handed offspring to a career in mathematics cum engineering.
Wadekar seniors hopes were dashed however when his precocious colt doggedly placed precedence on his bats and balls over his books and calculators and set his young sights on representing his beloved country in the Test arena. Ajit had his skills honed on the weed strewn Shivaji Park, that precious plot of real estate that has spawned an unprecedented assembly line of top class Test cricketers for the Yellow, White and Green colored flag and country. On his way to the top that doyen of cricketing gurus Joe Kamath had found and fixed Ajits flaws. Before all the said hype and hullabaloo, once on a bus ride Indian leg spinner Baloo Gupte who was sitting alongside the future icon had invited little Ajit to make up his tennis ball side as the 12th man. Ajit took up the offer and never looked back.
Much later the youngster came into prominence with a cracking triple century in first class cricket - 323 in 489 minutes with 40 fours, to comprehensively stamp his undoubted class. Strutting his stuff tall, fair, handsome and angular, Ajit had his left handed batting running along textbooks lines, clean and crisp as his bat ran sweetly through the cherry, proceeding to execute his left handed cover drives, square cuts and delectable clips-to-leg off his bootlaces, and then again he would sink onto his left knee and sweep ever so sweetly past square.
As a youngster I remember watching him from the boundary lines of SSC, NCC, CCC or wherever. Strutting his stuff in the slips - he was simply one of the best in that position - Ajit snapped up 46 catches in the 37 Tests and in all first class games, slammed over 15,000 runs and snapped up 271 catches for added measure. Replete with lazy elegance he notched up 2113 Test runs in 37 outings almost always striding in at the pivotal number 3 position.
Have Spin Will Win His key strategy in heralding the dawn of Indias winning ways was to pack his bowling armory with spin - the oh, so dizzying spin of the likes of Bedi, Venkat, Prasanna and Chandrasekhar, intelligently making astute use of the precious commodity that was readily available across the Indian states. Besides which Eknath Solkar fielding within pick-pocketing distance of the batter latched onto some spectacular catches to assist the spin quartet.
Laid back elegance my first brush with the iconic Indian was when my dad Leo dragged me along to the State Bank of India headquarters in Colombo where the left hander was being billeted, and being offered a piece of buttered toast and then another slice off his own plate for good measure - He was a personification of kindness. Then again the great man had the humility to spend a couple of days at our abode on the outskirts of Colombo along with his gracious wife Rekha and three precious children Prasad, Vipul and Kashmira.
Needless to say we were so honored. Mind you he was at the pinnacle of his cricketing career at that point of time. Then again whilst attending a bank symposium for Colombos Seylan Bank Plc, conducted at the Taj Lands End Hotel in Mumbai, the Indian great truly honored me with a courtesy call and even snapped a couple of selfies with me.
His loyalty towards, my dad Leo knows no bounds as they still communicate oh-so-frequently across the Palk Straits, My dad having struck up a friendship with him in the early sixties or thereabouts.
In 1974 Ajits Indians were comprehensively hammered by the English on English soil. They lost the 3 Test series 3-0 and the 2 ODIs to boot.
Following which Ajit was dealt with most tardily at best by the then BCCI. Consequently the icon virtually sank without a trace for a long while. That he was pensioned off before his punch and panache ran out is many a pundits view. Mercifully the ex left hander came back with a bang to serve his country, shoveling in tons of sweat back to the game he endorsed in the capacity of selector, coach and team manager. Ajit now spends his time ever so blissfully with gracious wife Rekha and his precious offspring, his trophy cabinet bursting at its seams, the Arjun Award and the Padma Shri Awards taking up the top shelf.

Aravinda de Silva resigns as cricket committee chairman
Sri Lanka Cricket announced the resignation of the Chairman of its Cricket Committee, Aravinda de Silva with effect from 30th June 2017.
De Silva who spearheaded the Cricket Committee of SLC in discussions with SLC President stated that he was forced to step down after chairing the Committee for over a year due to personal commitments that would hinder his availability and time investment in the Committee further.
Commenting on de Silvas resignation, SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala said, For someone like Aravinda cricket is a full time occupation. As an administrator of his calibre, he eats, drinks and sleeps cricket. Its understandable that he needs to prioritise his personal commitments - he has supported the strategic vision of this administration and been vastly instrumental in many of the developments we have made.
We intend to continue to engage Aris expertise in our key cricketing activities on a consultancy basis, he said.
The National Cricket Committee was formed in March 2016, to evaluate the existing stratagem of SLC and to make technical recommendations that would revamp the structure. The National High Performance Centre is a product of this shift.

Bash of politics to the calm of religion
The size of the May Day rallies of the main political parties remains the stuff of political discussion. The Joint Opposition (JO) certainly makes the claim of having the largest crowd, and meeting its own challenge to have a really big show at Galle Face Green. But, the comparison of crowds at May Day rallies, or at other political rallies, is certainly not the best assessment of political success. We are not too far from the time when Mahinda Rajapaksa and the UPFA led by him had truly big political rallies at the Presidential Election campaign in December 2014 to January 2015. Yet, the result was the defeat of the Rajapaksa Presidency. The history of SLFP politics is also shows that huge rallies have paved the way to defeat, rather than the much promised victory.
What stands out in the huge crowd at Galle Face Green and the park-filling crowd at the SLFPs official rally at Getambe, Kandy, is the clear division of the SLFP, which raises many questions as to how this May Day crowd performance should be properly assessed. The size of the crowd at Galle Face has already made the formal leader of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Prof. G. L. Peiris, to state that JO members will not seek SLFP nominations for elections again, but would contest from the SLPP. What does this mean for SLFP unity, which remains a strong underlying demand among the divided leadership of the SLFP
Getambe rally
The Galle Face rally and its impact on SLFP politics in the coming weeks and months will certainly have considerable influence on the question of discipline within the SLFP. There are reports the party will take disciplinary action against the members who ignored the invitation to attend the Getambe rally, which was the official SLFP event, and preferred to be present at Galle Face. How deep can these promised disciplinary actions go What could be done beyond the replacement of party organisers from various electorates What disciplinary action can or would be taken against the MPs of the SLFP in the JO, who decided to ignore the invitation to Getambe, and thought it better to show up at Galle Face Green The major question is what disciplinary action is contemplated, or is possible, against the Mahinda Rajapaksa, who gave the leadership to the Galle Face event, and sees it as one more event that paves the way for his promise to defeat the Government very soon  or at least within the next two Vesak Full Moons
President Maithripala Sirisena has cause for satisfaction about May Day, with his success in having the second successful May Day rally of the SLFP in a provincial city  in Kandy this year, after Galle last year. The crowd at Getambe, under rainy conditions too, was certainly good, and showed that the section of the SLFP that accepts his leadership has a good following, in many parts of the country, both urban and rural. The crowd there was a clear demonstration that Mahinda Rajapaksa does not remain the unquestioned leader of the SLFP, or UPFA anymore, whatever his talk of coming government changes. Yet, there is no question that the success of the rallies at Getambe and Galle Face shows a disturbing division of major proportions within the SLFP, and calls for early political action to restore unity within the party, if it to make progress in developments of the coming months, as a major political party in the country. The big issue ahead is the Local Government elections, which the Government has said will take place this year. The JO is already making loud statements that the Galle Face show is the way to its success in these polls. What is now considered the Maithripala Sirisena or MS wing of the SLFP will certainly have to take action, whether disciplinary or otherwise, to restore proper unity within the party and be capable of facing the voters with strength in the promised LG polls.
The Campbell Park message
The UNPs May Day rally at Campbell Park in Colombo effectively showed the partys strength, without the divisions that were shown the rival events at Getambe and Galle Face. The greens brought their people in large numbers to make a good show in a city that also had the JOs Galle Face rally and the JVPs rally at the BRC, as well as several other small May Day events. As May Day is now a political event, and not anymore a day of the working people in this country, the Campbell Park rally certainly gave an important political message  that of the success of unity in politics.
Although cartoons and some political commentators see the JOs Galle Face crowd as a failure or defeat of Ranil Wickremesinghe, in giving the Galle Face Green to the JO, with the challenge to possibly fill the Green. The reality is certainly not that simple. What the UNP showed at Campbell Park is a crowd that was overflowing the venue, without any political division. It was a major contrast to the SLFP-UPFA events at Getambe and Galle Face Green. The unity seen at Campbell Park, where the UNP did present some of its own policies on economics and development to the public was a clear show of strength as a single undivided party in politics today. It showed the essential weakness of large, but divided crowds, in the context of electoral politics, and certainly gave the impression that it must make a stronger call for the Local Government polls to be held soon.
The unity of the UNP as shown at Campbell Park gives a push for the efforts by President Sirisena to reduce the divisions that exist within the government of National Unity, with several SLFP members, particularly ministers, being critical of the UNP, and even calling for a breakaway from the party that was most supportive of the Common Candidate  Maithripala Sirisena - in the January 08 Presidential Election; certainly much more than most SLFP members who hold Cabinet rank today. The talks to iron out the differences that exist between the SLFP and UNP are expected to start soon, with President Sirisena showing the necessity for continued unity, especially in the context of the JOs moves to break whatever unity that exists within the UNP-SLFP coalition that forms then Government of National Unity.
The calm of religion
After the joys of the National New Year shattered by the Meethotamulla disaster, and the displays of political rivalries on May Day, the country moves on to a period of religious calm, with the forthcoming Vesak Full Moon celebrations., which will be the first time that the United Nations Vesak Day will be celebrated in Sri Lanka.
The celebrations will see leaders from countries around the world with strong associations with Buddhism. The prominent among them will be Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Nepali President Bidya Devi Bandan, the countries that saw the birth of the Prince Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, and the initial spread of his teachings of Buddhism; and remain closely associated with Sri Lanka on aspects of its modern development of Buddhism.
Sri Lankans will be able to send a good message to the world on the presence and importance of Buddhism in the culture and lives of the people here, through the Vesak celebrations, which have always been marked for the demonstrations of the values of sharing and charity, as well as the celebration of the Light of the Dhamma or Buddhist teaching, as seen in the Vesak decorations from the simple to the large pandals and other decorations.
There were signs of attempts to raise some political storms during the Vesak season with the presence of a large number of foreign dignitaries in the country. Not surprisingly Wimal Weerawansa did call for the flying of black flags to protest at the presence of the Indian Prime Minister Modi in the country. His call has not any public response, and has even been rejected by many of his own political associates.
President Sirisena has made it very clear that the UN Vesak celebrations will be confined to religion and culture of the county, with no agreements to be signed with any country, and will be a period of necessary calm amidst the joy at celebrating the Birth, Enlightenment and Passing Away of the Buddha, as has been the strong tradition in Sri Lanka.
This is certainly a calm that is very much needed in the country, and there will be expectation that such calm, may help in the government and the country face up to many problems that are lined up ahead, which includes the major issue of corruption, and the advancing situation of trade union action that has a very strong political association, built up on considerable areas of weakness of the government- especially the cost of living and other hardships faced by the people.

Bundala, the reputed place for migratory birds no more
Bundala which was a haven for migratory and resident birds is now being frequented by wild elephants and as such nature lovers and bird enthusiasts do not consider Bundala as a bird watching location, the residents of the area said. They said that they derived a sound income from the bird watchers in the past but now only a few bird watchers arrive here as such their income has decreased.
When queried about this situation the Assistant Director of Wild Life Southern region Prasanna Wimaladasa said, Bundala is a wetland that has gained wide reputation around the globe, and a haven for resident and migratory birds, but today as a result of flowing of excess water of the Malala Aaara into the Bundala lagoon. A scarcity of food for the migratory and resident birds has been created and as such the resident and migratory birds keep away from the Bundala lagoon. The Assistant Director further said that as a result of wild elephants in large numbers, the birds are scared to roam about in the Bundala bird sanctuary.

Champion Aussie Michael Diamond stripped of his gun
SYDNEY friday: The career of Australia's most decorated shooter Michael Diamond appears to have come to an end after a court found him guilty of firearms and drink-driving offences, and banned him from holding a gun licence for a decade.
Diamond, a double Olympic gold medallist, was charged in May last year after an alleged domestic incident involving his brother.
He had pleaded not guilty after police found a shotgun and 150 rounds of ammunition in his car, with the 44-year-old reportedly refusing to take a breath test.
The Raymond Terrace Local Court in Sydney late Thursday issued Diamond with a 12-month good behaviour bond, and the firearm was forfeited to the crown for 10 years, a court clerk said.
Diamond's barrister Daniel McMahon had asked the magistrate to proceed without a conviction as it would leave the six-time Olympian effectively without his professional career, the Daily Telegraph reported.
The charges dashed his hopes of competing in a seventh Olympics last year in Rio.
Diamond won trap shooting gold at the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Olympics, and finished just outside the medals in fourth at London five years ago.
He is also a five-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist.

CHEC Port City Colombo to transform Diyawanna Lake for Vesak
The 14th United Nations Day of Vesak will take place in Sri Lanka this year, giving Sri Lankans the unique opportunity of commemorating the festival on an international platform.
The Government in collaboration with the Buddha Sasana Ministry has declared a Vesak Week from May 7 to May 14. Therefore, Vesak 2017 is slated to be a special time for the country; with several international delegations comprising more than 3,000 people expected to arrive in the country during the festival week.
With the intention of making the Vesak week even more memorable for local and international visitors alike, CHEC Port City Colombo has joined hands with the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, the organizers of the Diyawanna Vesak zone. The project company has undertaken to build the Diyawanna water counter; comprising of a massive water fountain in the middle of the Diyawanna lake and a water curtain that would screen the Diyatha side of the bridge.
The fountain on the lake which would be called the Colombo Water Fountain - Sri Lanka will
reach around 30 to 35 meters in height, whilst its 16 meter diameter is expected to have an actual range of about 32 meters. Designed with stainless LED lights and artistic formations, using the latest technology, the water fountain would be an impressive sight that is set to delight the senses of the viewer.
The other eye catching creation by the Port City would be the Bridge waterfall which is a water
curtain built alongside the Diyawanna bridge. The 70 meters long water curtain which will flow on the bridge side, would be lit with full coloured stainless steel LED lights at night, giving it an almost ethereal feeling.
The Diyawanna water counter is to become a permanent feature, post Vesak. The two water features which would be the first of their kind to be built in Sri Lanka, would not only be the high point of attraction this Vesak, but is expected to become one of the most popular large-scale artificial landscapes in Colombo.

Chinas young snooker players take cues from star Ding
BEIJING: At the World Snooker College in China's capital, there are no textbooks or exams, just rows upon rows of snooker tables and an ever-growing trophy case.
Clad in T-shirts and baggy sweatpants, the lanky teenage students at the Beijing boarding school -- the first of its kind in China -- practise snooker eight hours a day in the hopes of following in the footsteps of their idol Ding Junhui.
Ding, a 30-year-old native of eastern Jiangsu province, won two ranking titles at the precocious age of 18, and became the most successful Asian player in history last year after making it to the final of the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, Britain.
Despite many expecting him to again reach the final this year, he was knocked out at the semi-final stage by England's Mark Selby, the eventual champion, in a close match on Saturday.
"Of course I'm disappointed," said student Wu Ze, 16, idly swinging his cue. "(The championships) were such a good opportunity to realise his dreams."
Ding's dreams are entwined with those of China, where he is considered a national hero among the 70 million people -- and counting -- estimated to play billiard sports. "A lot of parents want their kids to learn the sport after seeing (Ding) on TV," said Wei Chunlong, a manager of the World Snooker College.
An offshoot of the Chinese Billiards and Snooker Association (CBSA), the academy's 24 students hail from across China and are foregoing traditional schooling. Instead of school desks, their two classrooms have snooker tables and instead of regular teachers, they have four coaches. In place of exams, they have competitions.
Xu Shi, 19, will move to Sheffield at the end of May to join the four students who have gone on to play professionally since the academy opened in 2013.
"I only feel tired after I put down my cue," Xu said.
"I've never considered being anything other than a snooker player." Ding shot to snooker stardom in 2002, when he triumphed at the World Under-21 Championship. Three years later, he won his first ranking title at the China Open, delighting a burgeoning fan base in Beijing.
With his rise came the rise of snooker in China: the number of cue sport players in the country increased by 40 percent between 2005 and 2014, according to the CBSA. By 2012, half of the world's highest-level snooker competitions were being hosted in China.
"Ding's success not only spurred the rapid expansion of snooker clubs, but also drove vast numbers of young people to the sport," said CBSA Secretary-General Wang Tao. Wang said these aspirants particularly admire the dogged determination and sacrifice -- Ding's family reportedly sold their house and grocery story to launch his career -- that brought a "boy with Chinese roots" to Britain's hallowed Crucible Theatre, the perennial stage for the World Snooker Championship.
Though he spends most of his time training in Britain, Ding is well aware of his Chinese following, and even goes by the nickname "Dragon". "They will be going crazy back home for this," he said ahead of the final last year. "I know that they want me to do well, to win it and bring the trophy back home." - AFP

## Title: Dual Citizenship and politics
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial
## Date: Saturday, May 6, 2017 - 01:00
Dual Citizenship and politics
In a landmark judgement, the Appeal Court has ruled that Geetha Kumarasinghe is no longer eligible to continue as a Member of Parliament on account of her being a dual citizen  of Switzerland as well as Sri Lanka. This is a direct result of an inclusion of a clause in the 19th Amendment which expressly bars dual citizens from contesting national elections. However, this is the first time that the law has been put to the test.
While Ms. Kumarasinghe will no doubt appeal to the Supreme Court, one cannot underestimate the significance of the Appeal Court decision. The crux of the matter is that one cannot have one leg in Sri Lanka and the other in another country if the true intention is to serve the Motherland. Being an MP or minister requires total loyalty and dedication to the Motherland. Having citizenship or interests in another country may interfere with this mission.
But as several political parties have pointed out, the law in this regard should be equal to all. It is no secret that there are several MPs representing practically all the parties in Parliament who hold dual citizenship or Permanent Resident status in another country, mostly the USA. In fact, several ministers acknowledged that others having dual citizenship could face the same fate and JVP MP Vijitha Herath has also called on the authorities to take similar action against other MPs, both in the Government and the Opposition, having dual citizenship. All right thinking citizens will agree with his suggestion that Parliament should reveal the names of dual citizens in Parliament. Afterwards, they should be given a choice  either renounce the foreign citizenship to become a full-time citizen in Sri Lanka or if that citizenship sounds better than being an MP in Sri Lanka, retain it. In that case, the MP will have to bid adieu to Parliamentary politics. This should be extended to provincial councils and local bodies too.
Although the Frontline Socialist Party (Peratugami) leader Kumar Gunaratnam is not an MP, his case perfectly illustrates the need for insisting on Sri Lankan citizenship for becoming an MP. Gunaratnam who came here from Australia, where he was known as Noel Mudalige, on a visitor visa tried to engage in local politics. Since our laws clearly state that foreigners cannot engage in local politics while on a normal visa, he was taken into custody. Recently, he agreed to renounce his Australian citizenship and regain Sri Lankan citizenship. Now he is freely engaging in local politics without experiencing any problem.
Most local politicians vent their ire on the imperialist white supremacists of the West in front of appreciative local audiences, but they actually covet residential status in countries such as the UK, USA and Canada. Some of them no doubt seek citizenship in another land as an insurance policy lest the political climate in the home country take a turn for the worse from their point of view.
The sons and daughters of most MPs are also studying in Western countries. This is true even for some of the most vociferous followers of Lenin and Marx in local politics. Do they send their offspring to Russia or China Hardly. Such hypocrisy must end.
The concept of dual citizenship in itself is not a bad one. Many Sri Lankans who had lived abroad for decades are now keen to come back to repay their debt to the Motherland. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has appealed to all Lankan expatriates and Diaspora groups to contribute generously to the countrys development drive. Many have already accepted this invitation.
Becoming a Sri Lankan citizen again has many advantages, from property rights to voting rights. Some others do not want to come back on a permanent basis, but seek the convenience of unlimited stays when they come to Sri Lanka occasionally. The demand for dual citizenship is rising and each citizenship ceremony of the Department of Immigration and Emigration attracts over 1,000 Lankans living overseas. The Government has been criticized for the high fees charged for dual citizenship from the principal applicants, but the amount is perfectly reasonable in the context of funds the State had spent on them for education, health and other facilities during the years they had spent in Sri Lanka.
But politics and dual citizenship do not essentially mix, as there is a real possibility of a conflict of interest and distraction from duties. Politics is all about serving the people, every hour of the day. Once simply cannot swear allegiance to another country if there is a genuine desire to uplift the people of Sri Lanka. Only a bona fide citizen and full-time resident can feel the pulse of the people and resolve their problems. Thus the architects of the 19th Amendment, one of the most progressive pieces of legislation seen in recent times, were correct in deciding to include the clause on dual citizenship. Those representatives of the people still holding on to their citizenship in another country must now consider where their loyalties lie and act accordingly.

LOS ANGELES Friday: A bat flew from the hands of Padres hitter Hector Sanchez Thursday and struck a fan sitting behind home plate in the head, team officials said.
Sanchez had swung and missed a pitch in the ninth inning when the bat slipped out of his hands and flew over the netting designed to protect fans in the stands.
It hit two people, the Padres said, including a woman who was struck in the forehead.
We never want to see anybody injured while enjoying a game at Petco Park, the Padres said in a statement. The guests who were struck by Hector Sanchezs bat in the ninth inning have received medical attention and been transported to a local hospital. As ushers and medical personnel rushed to help the woman hit in the head, the crowd went silent.
Eventually, she walked to a wheelchair and was wheeled out as her fellow fans applauded.
Both were in good spirits and their injuries do not appear to be serious, the Padres said.
After play resumed, Sanchez popped out. The Padres eventually fell 3-2 to the Colorado Rockies in 11 innings.

French Presidential candidate Macron condemns 'massive' hacking attack as documents leaked

The campaign of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron says it has been the target of a "massive hacking attack" after a trove of documents was released online.
The campaign said that genuine files were mixed up with fake ones in order to confuse people.
It said that it was clear the hackers wanted to undermine Macron ahead of Sunday's second round vote.
The centrist will face off against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.
The documents were leaked on a file sharing website late on Friday, as the official presidential campaigning period drew to a close.
The Macron camp condemned the leak minutes before the midnight deadline (22:00 GMT).
Candidates and the media now face restrictions until the polls close on Sunday evening, meaning Macron cannot issue any more statements.
Opinion polls had indicated the former economy minister carried a lead of 20 percentage points or more over Le Pen.
What was released
About nine gigabytes of data were posted online by an anonymous user.
The details are unclear so far, but Macron's En Marche movement said internal campaign documents, including emails and financial data, had been taken in an "act of massive, co-ordinated hacking".
"The leaked files were obtained several weeks ago by hacking personal and professional email accounts of several officials of the movement," it said in a statement.
The campaign said the documents showed only legitimate campaign activities.
France's election authorities have warned media outlets against reporting on the contents of the leaked documents because of the restrictions now in place.
Who might be responsible
That too remains unclear. The Macron camp has not blamed any specific party but said the hack clearly aimed to damage it and undermine French democracy,
It compared it to the leak of Democratic Party emails in last year's US presidential election that was blamed on Russian hackers.
Wikileaks, which published those emails, posted a link to the Macron documents on Twitter but implied it was not responsible.
Last month security experts from the company Trend Micro said that Russian hackerswere targeting Macron's campaign.
Russia has denied that it is behind attacks aimed at Macron.
On Thursday, the centrist candidatefiled a lawsuitover online rumors that he had a secret bank account in the Caribbean.
Macron called the allegations "fake news and lies" and said some of the sites spreading them were "linked to Russian interests".
What else happened on the final day of campaigning
Separate security alerts in and around Parismarred Friday's final scramble by the candidates to court voters.
A suspected radical Islamist possessing weapons and a pledge of allegiance to IS was arrested north of the capital.
And Greenpeace activists scaled the Eiffel Tower to unfurl a banner, sparking an emergency police meeting.
What is at stake on Sunday
France's voters have rejected the two big political parties - the Socialists and the Republicans - that have governed for decades,
Voters will be making a decision on France's future direction and on its place at the heart of the European Union.
If they opt for liberal Emmanuel Macron, they will be backing a candidate who seeks EU reform as well as deeper European integration, in the form of a eurozone budget and eurozone finance ministers.
If instead they choose far-right Marine Le Pen she promises quite the opposite. She wants a Europe of nations to replace the EU.
"I give myself six months to negotiate with the EU the return of sovereignty. Then it will be the French who decide," she tweeted.
The assumption is that she would fail and a referendum would take place initially on France's membership of the euro.
After the Brexit vote in the UK and the election of US President Donald Trump, France is the latest country to deal a blow to politics as usual.
What are the battleground issues
One of the overriding issues facing French voters is unemployment, which stands at almost 10% and is the eighth highest among the 28 EU member states. One in four under-25s is unemployed.
The French economy has made a slow recovery from the 2008 financial crisis and all the leading candidates say deep changes are needed.
Economic challenges facing next president
Marine Le Pen wants the pension age cut to 60 and to "renationalise French debt", which she argues is largely held by foreigners.
Emmanuel Macron wants to cut 120,000 public-sector jobs, reduce public spending by 60bn (50bn; $65bn), plough billions into investment and reduce unemployment to below 7%.
What about security
The election is taking place amid a state of emergency, and the first round took place three days after a policeman was shot dead on the Champs Elyses in the heart of Paris.
More than 230 people have died in terror attacks since January 2015 and officials fear more of the hundreds of young French Muslims who travelled to Syria and Iraq may return to commit new atrocities.
Intelligence services believe attackers are deliberately pursuing a Le Pen victory, says the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris - because that could tip the country into chaos.
The former FN leader wants to suspend the EU's open-border agreement on France's frontiers and expel foreigners who are on the watch lists of intelligence services.
What happens after Sunday
Macron and Le Pen came top of the 11 candidates in total who participated in the first round of voting on 23 April.
While the outcome of Sunday's second round should be clear that evening, the results will be officially proclaimed by France's constitutional council on Thursday, 11 May.
Sunday, 14 May, marks the end of outgoing President Franois Hollande's term, and is the latest possible date for the inauguration and official transfer of power to his successor.

Doctors were present, but they did not perform their duties. However, the in-patients, urgent and serious patients were being treated.
Meanwhile, the train service stopped and the people were seeking alternative transport services.

GMOA Strike Under Fire On Social Media
As the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) strike was underway, Facebook and Twitter erupted in argument over the legitimacy of the trade union action. While some argued that trade union action was part of a healthy, functioning democracy, the majority were of the authoritarian opinion that trade union action of this kind must be forcibly stopped.
Those that observed trade union action were a function of democracy opined the trade union action was merely the downside of democracy  the right to freedom of expression, but others argued the armed forces should be deployed to carry out essential services as this was the order of the day some years back and should it not be followed now
Adding fuel to fire were reports that prominent doctors affiliated with the GMOA were in fact not on strike at private hospitals. The guise with which they played their purported double game was swiftly uncovered when Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake made an appointment with GMOA Chairman Dr. Anurudda Padeniya at the Nawaloka Hospital, proving the doctors' strike was political not practical.
Adherents of social media were quick to point out it was the poor man that was affected by the GMOA strike, not patients with means. There were those that said the GMOA ought to be punished, and that hypocrisy of the GMOA must be uncovered. Others wondered aloud why transport trade unions had joined with the GMOAs cause while still others did as Cicero did and lamented the times: O tempora o mores.
Meanwhile certain fuel stations decided to join in on the trade union action by refusing to fill up vehicles owned by doctors on strike. Displaying prominently signboards that said they would not service striking doctors, the fuel attendants turned away vehicles bearing doctors insignia, much to social media's congratulation for dealing the doctors with a taste of their own medicine.
The Government Medical Officers' Association is protesting the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM). The issue is a long-standing one, and although the government offered solution last month in the form of a private-public partnership, the GMOA remain adamant they want the private institute shut.
The token strike yesterday is a precursor to a much larger strike threatened by the GMOA. Over a 100 trade unions are reported to have joined with the GMOA's token strike yesterday, and several more have promised to join hands with the Association to conduct continued strikes until the government relents.

Heated argument interrupts Treasury bond proceedings
A heated argument interrupted the proceedings of the Presidential Commission Inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue, yesterday. The argument erupted between the Attorney General's panel and Legal Counsels Chanaka de Silva, Harsha Fernando and Nihal Fernando.
Fernando and de Silva accused the AG's panel of being biased and partial in leading evidence and summoning witnesses.
Chanaka de Silva, the Legal Counsel for former Governor Arjun Mahendran, objecting to the way in which evidence was lead, pointed out to the Commission that the AG's panel was leading evidence to which the Commissioners agreed and advised not to do so. Senior State Counsellor Shaheeda Barrie was leading evidence for the day.
The argument broke as the AG's panel was leading evidence through Central Bank Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalaal Weerasinghe. Dr. Weerasinghe was questioned on the 27 February 2015 Tender Board paper's minutes.
Objecting to the questioning, de Silva asked as to why the Board minutes were not put to Deputy Governor P. Samarasiri who was the ex-officio Chairman of the Tender Board. Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera said the reason why the AG's panel did not put the minute to DG Samarasiri is because he has not executed his professional responsibility properly. Harsha Fernando, the Legal Counsel for DG P. Samarasiri, swiftly pointed out to the Commission that this statement very clearly showed that the AG's panel was leading evidence partially. Fernando said that it was a shame the way the AG's panel was acting. He also said the AG's panel was working based on their own conclusions. It was also pointed out that the AG's panel was acting biased when summoning witnesses to testify before the Commission. It was also highlighted that the AG's panel head de Livera used the word 'gallow' in a previous occasion too at the Commission. De Livera said he could take an independent decision and that the Attorney General could accuse anyone who had done wrong.
The Commission made a special statement on its mandate. The Commission said it would not accuse or convict anyone for wrong doing and that it would operate within its mandate. The Commissioners also said they would mention in the special report the Commission was to make, that Dr. Weerasinghe's evidence were his personal opinion only.
The Commission also said the Attorney General could take legal action, if it wanted to, against any party who had done wrong in the Treasury bond issue after the Commission had submitted its report on the case.

I have received threats, says anti-doping chief McLaren
Man who lifted lid on biggest doping scandal:
He is the man who lifted the lid on one of the biggest doping scandals in sport history.
The fallout from Professor Richard McLarens two reports, which claimed there was an orchestrated program of cheating involving the Russian ministry of sport, Federal Security Service (FSB) and national sports and anti-doping bodies between 2011 and 2015, has been considerable.
Russia has arguably been embarrassed on the world stage and the majority of its track and field athletes remain excluded from international events.
Likewise McLarens conclusion that the 2012 Olympics was corrupted on an unprecedented scale, would have made for uncomfortable reading for the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
Given those ructions, perhaps it shouldnt be altogether surprising that theres also been a personal fallout for the Canadian law professor.
Ive received various threats by email sources, but I dont pay attention to those, McLaren tells CNN, speaking nearly 10 months on since the publication of his first report.
I like to be careful about my personal well being, but I dont have any concerns.
Its very common when something like this is produced and goes in the public domain to attack the messenger because by attacking the messenger you dont have to deal with the message.
Well, its time to deal with the message and forget about the messenger.
YOU EXPECT TO BE ISOLATED
The Canadian, who was appointed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in May 2016, says he had no idea he would discover what he did when he first started his investigation.
The McLaren report said that more than 1,000 Russian athletes across at least 20 sports, including football, were involved in or benefited from doping, with medalists implicated not only at London 2012 but the 2013 World Athletics Championships in Moscow and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.
His second report, published in December 2016, provided supporting evidence to his initial findings, with the Canadian claiming there was an institutionalized conspiracy in the country.
When you take on a role like Ive taken on you expect to be somewhat isolated, he said.
You expect to be not be everybodys favorite person to see or talk with. That all goes with the territory.
Alright, they may be bigger, stronger and more powerful, but I think they might find that there are lots of things that I can do as an independent person running this inquiry, which is now finished, which will require them to respond.
INVIGORATED INVOLVEMENT OF ATHLETES
McLaren has previously spoken about his frustrations with the lack of action taken by sports bodies in response to his findings and, four months after the publication of the second report, he still believes the response to his investigations continues to be very slow.
In December, just days after he published his second report, a widespread boycott of the bobsleigh and skeleton world championships saw the event pulled from Russia and moved to Germany.
Amid all the politicking, McLaren is full of praise for the athletes for taking action. One of the great benefits thats come out of my work has been the new, invigorated involvement of athletes who are current competitors pushing their own sport organization to respond and be responsive to whats going on, he said.
Theyre demanding responses from the people in charge of these organizations. I think thats a very positive, progressive step -- perhaps the most important when we look back in a couple of years time.
PROTECTING CLEAN ATHLETES
McLarens first report was met with denials from Russia and calls for more proof from the IOC.
Last August, he accused the IOC, via the Guardian, of misrepresenting his findings and said it did not speak to him or his team before deciding to let Russian athletes compete at Rio 2016, subject to certain conditions.
The IOC, choosing not to impose a blanket ban on Russian athletes at last summers Olympics, left the decision instead to individual sporting federations over whether the countrys athletes could compete.
Athletics governing body, the IAAF, extended Russias ban in December, which had covered the Olympics, from international athletics competitions and in April said Russia was making little progress cleaning up its doping culture to secure its reinstatement. In February, WADA said there were certain discrepancies in the report, while McLaren has had to defend his investigation, saying in March that comments by sports bodies -- including the IOC -- which referred to inadequate translations of Russian documents was nitpicking. However in March, Russian President Vladimir admitted that the countrys anti-doping system had failed. The main thing is that despite the shortcomings in the work of [Mclarens] independent commission, we should pay attention to what it did, to the results of its work, Putin was quoted as telling Russia Today.
On Tuesday, McLaren, the IOC and WADA put forward a united front.
McLaren, IOC president Thomas Bach and WADA president, Sir Craig Reedie, issued a joint statement following a meeting between the trio in Lausanne to discuss a strategy for a more robust and efficient anti-doping system. The statement said the IOCs Inquiry Commission would continue to investigate and address the systematic manipulation of the anti-doping system in Russia. All Russian samples were, said the statement, under investigation by the Oswald Commission.
Our common goal is to do everything possible to protect the clean athletes so that such a systematic manipulation of the anti-doping system can never happen again, read the statement.  CNN

Living wisdom
I was surprised to witness the interest payed to Gomin Dayasiris contribution to the 125 year issue of the Anandian. It is the school that produced the left leaders such as Philip and NM and leftists still claim with great pride. However those who brought up in western tradition generally had a degrading opinion of Ananda, in particular as a Yako school with poor knowledge in English.
Herbert Kodikara, who believes that Ananda was created for the children of down trodden, says One of the great products of our Yako School was Tarzie Vittachi (born on the 23rd September 1921). A pure Anandian, and of the University of Ceylon, who became the youngest Editor at the age of 32 of the oldest Newspaper in Asia (the Ceylon Observer  founded in 1832) and winner of Ramon Magsaysay award in 1959 for journalism, the second Lankan to win the this award. He finally became the UNICEF deputy executive Director of external relations. In the 50s Royalists and Thomians preparing for the School Certificate examination in English were advised to read Tarzie Vittachis editorials to improve their English!
I did not know that famous Prof WS Karunarathne is also a product of Ananda. He was born on the 24th of December 1928 at Katugastota. Son of a poor police man, With a Yako training at Ananda, WS entered Ceylon University in 1948, winning the prestigious Moulana prize by scoring the highest grade nationally by a student entering the University, beating the Great Royalist Felix Dias Bandaranaike to second place! He passed out first of the first class in 1952. Instead of joining the civil service he became an assistant lecturer at the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya.
At the age of 28 he obtained the Doctorate from the University of London, winning the prestigious F L Woodward prize of the school of the Oriental and African studies. His brilliance was such that when the department of Pali and Buddhist civilization was established, as a separate department from the department of Buddhist philosophy in 1964, he was chosen over the competing candidate Ven. Walpola Rahula and becoming the youngest Professor of the University of Ceylon.
Post-colonial society
I should not forget to mention my contemporaries Prof M P Ranaweera who was the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering at Peradeniya, Army General Rohan Daluwatta, Prof JB Dissanayake, who with the help of a Nadagam Gurannanse, in 1957 produced the brilliant Nadagamma  Rawana. JB is one of the leading authorities in Sinhala language. In the field of Journalism we cannot forget Meemana Premathillake; He was the legendary editor of the Silumina and the great Sinhala poet. As an engineer I should not forget to mention Devapura Jayasena Wimala Surendendra, born 17th September 1874 entered Ceylon Technical College in 1893 from Ananda. This Yako was to the World a Brilliant Star in the Galaxy of Engineers, becoming the Chief Engineer in the Public Works department. Hes named as the Father of Hydro-power in Sri Lanka, establishing Norton Bridge and Laxapana Hydro-power systems.
After reading the article of Gomin on Ananda, I also started re-thinking about my experience as a product of Ananda. Of course nobody a product of college primary, secondary education; but there is something common which may be recognized by the society.
When I entered Ananda in 1953, of course it had the reputation of producing a large number of students entering the different faculties of the Ceylon University. Also, Ananda was known to win the Herman Loos shield for the best platoon. I was party to the 1959 cadetting team, which won not only the Herman loose but also the Millers Cup for best shooting. It is true that Anandians were not given much space in the private sector establishments. According to Gomin, in the minds of those that mattered, Ananda did not have a pedigree that branded it as an elite public school! Perhaps this changed in our times because Karu Jayasuriya entered private sector and became a powerful CEO. So did Bandaragama Karu, Dr Neville etc.
It is true that Ananda did not fall in line with the values that were treasured by the immediate post-colonial society with its haughty old boy networks from other upper class oriented schools. May be some eminent old boys of Ananda felt inferior and loathed disclosing school identity in fear of being treated badly. Yes, I agree that in that topsy-turvy social ladder, to be a planter or tea taster brought more glory than being a banker or an accountant. Yet Anandians reached dizzy heights through higher education and often reached the hall of fame in the jewel of the crown appointments in the prestigious Ceylon Civil Service (CCS) and the learned professions.
Buddhist philosophy
Grudgingly I would agree with Gomin when he says I remember a few distinguished old boys (including Presidents of the OBA), did, in my time, sent their kids to the old school but soon transferred them to St. Thomas or Trinity in fear of foul contamination. Fortunately my father was a Trinitian and had his education abroad, loathed the colonial system and was the first civil servant to don the national dress to office and was adamant that his son is a product of a Sinhala Buddhist orientation.
My mother sobbed late into that night for the stupidity of enrolling me at a yako school and was taunted by her family of Thomians, since it lowered in their wonky esteem by having a family member from a school where the boys (mispronounced) were mocked for eating the five cent gram and travelling by tram. Yes I could remember how everybody teased us claiming that Anandians have no sense of diphthongs and vowel sounds. Then, I never thought I could write articles to an English daily paper. But today, grammar is looked after by computers and we are free to write, if one has ideas and facts to present. In the modern world often we find well written articles, good English but gives out nothing; only idiotic nonsense.
I must say clearly, that I got this fearless urge to tell truth as I understand, from the teachers at Ananda College. Somehow, we were told to believe that as we come from Sinhala Buddhist tradition we should not heed caste, race or creed; we should look at the other with meththa, karuna, muditha and upekka. We should reject loba, devesha and moha. We owe most ethical thought in life to peers at Ananda who taught us a value structure that enabled us to advance in life in a transforming, turbulent Lanka. I was able to see the close connection between Buddhist philosophy and dialectics of Marxism. Once I realized this, I became stable and free of internal contradictions. On that solid foundation I was enabled to fight for the right of self determination for all nationalities in Lanka. Support for my thinking came not necessarily from Anandians. Those old differences have now paled into insignificance.
Democratic revolution
War and cricket, both tied down by ethical considerations, are considered to be Lankas twin claims to fame during the last period of oppression and terrorism. School traditions have to give way to ethics of war. Ananda produced many commanders in the first round of the war. Most soldiers had to throw away the Buddhist vision of meththa, karuna, muditha and upekka.
What fired war time generation at Ananda, was a combination of revenge and domination. At home and school environment, Decent Sinhala Buddhist homes where culture and values were based on four humanist principles, changed by miss education propelled by hate and revenge. Earlier prime characteristics; parental care and family life were a predominant factor; education was the prime goal sought; people cared for the society they habituated. All these had to give in to the fascistic moral rules introduced from above. Gone are the inspiration received from the in-house pedagogues - Ven Kosgama Vachissara, mascot of Ananda in our times where his word was almost the sacred gospel. However so many Anandians contributed to the democratic revolution started two years back and that will influence the future generations of Ananda.

Molinari leads Wells Fargo, Johnson in hunt
WASHINGTON friday: Francesco Molinari birdied his final hole to grab the early lead at the Wells Fargo Championship as world number one Dustin Johnson had a solid round in his return from a back injury.
Italy's Molinari chipped in from the rough on No. 18 for his eighth birdie of the day to open with a six-under 66 at the Eagle Point Golf Club in Wilmington, North Carolina.
Sweden's Alex Noren, and Americans JB Holmes, Grayson Murray and Brian Campbell were tied for second after shooting 67s.
Ken Duke, Ben Martin and Northern Ireland's Seamus Power fired four-under 68s and are two strokes back of Molinari.
The 34-year-old Molinari is seeking his first victory on the US PGA Tour. This is his 99th start since turning pro in 2004.
He has won four times on the European Tour including the Italian Open in 2006 and 2016. He also captured the 2010 WGC-HSBC Champions event in 2010 by beating Lee Westwood by one stroke.
Johnson shot a two-under 70 Thursday in a round that included four birdies, 12 pars and two bogeys.
His best stretch was back-to-back birdies on his front nine which comprised the par-three 15th and the par-four 16th holes.
On number 15, his 200-yard tee shot rolled down a slope towards the hole leaving him with a nine-foot putt for birdie.
This is Johnson's first tournament since withdrawing from the Masters after injuring his back on the eve of the first major of the season.
He slipped and fell down a flight of stairs at a rental house in Augusta on the night before the tournament.
The 32-year-old American, who defends his first major title at next month's US Open, is aiming to stretch a winning streak that has seen him capture his past three PGA starts.
I thought I drove it nicely, Johnson said. Hit a lot of good iron shots. I'm happy with the way I played, for sure.
As far as physically, no issues, he added. That's a good thing. I just need to get some rounds in, get some more reps, but I feel like the golf swing's in good shape.
If I hit it like I did today the next few days, then I'll be right there on Sunday.

Padeniya barred from scandalising court
Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya was yesterday noticed to appear before the Court of Appeal on May 22 for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgment dated January 31, 2017 which was delivered compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register the MBBS graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) provisionally as medical practitioners in terms of the Medical Ordinance.
Meanwhile, the two-Judge-Bench comprising Court of Appeal (President) Justice Vijith Malalgoda and Justice S. Thurai Rajah issued an Interim Order(IO) preventing GMOA President from making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalising the Court of Appeal until the next date.
Two civil society activists Prof.Sarath Wijesuriya, the Convener of National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) and Gamini Viyangoda, the co-convener of Puravesi Balaya Social Movement had filed this contempt of Court action naming GMOA President Dr.Anuruddha Padeniya as the respondent.
Presidents Counsel Upul Jayasuriya with counsel Chithrananda Liyanage appearing for the petitioners stated that upon the delivery of the said judgment by Court of Appeal, the GMOA has condemned and openly criticized the said judgment demanding to annulment or setting aside of the said judgment.
Jayasuriya further stated that in this backdrop the GMOA headed by Dr. Padeniya has called for a national front and trade union action against SAITM following Court decision in ordering SAITM medical graduates to be registered with the SLMC.
The petitioners stated that on or about April 7, 2017 the GMOA had organised islandwide trade union action against SAITM halting all health services including private practice and private health services to stress on the Government to abolish SAITM.
The petitioners stated that the contemptuous statements and comments demonstrate the blatant hatred of the respondent and publication of the same in the said speech indubitably disturbs the Court process and hampers and undermines the authority of the Court of Appeal in respect of the administration of justice especially in view of the fact that the said speech was published and telecast on several medias and has been uttered by the respondent in a public meeting held under topic of Abolish the SAITM on April 4, 2017.
The petitioners are pleading that Dr. Padeniya be charged on the offence of Contempt of Court of Appeal under Article 105 (3) of the constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka. They are further seeking an Interim Order restraining and preventing GMOA President from committing, making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalizing the Court of Appeal until the conclusion of this case. They further urge to impose sentence on the respondent as provided for in Article 105(3) of the Constitution.

Ending in unparliamentary language
FM's statement creates uproar in House
Joint Opposition members and Government side members locked horns in Parliament yesterday, when Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera brought to the notice of the House that MP Wimal Weerawansa accompanied by his son a delegate to the 7th Session of the World Urban Forum in Columbia in South America in 2014 during the previous regime.
The heated situation created soon after MP Weerawansa rose to deny the minister's statement stating he accompanied his son on his own expense.
The tense situation was created while the Foreign Affairs Minister was moving the order under the Diplomatic Privileges Act.
"When I see former Minister Weerawansa, I remember facts that I could point out the difference between the two eras of this government and the past," Minister Samaraweera said. "He accompanied his 11-year-old child to Columbia."
"I accompanied my son on my own expense," Weerawansa said. "You make false allegations as you don't have children." He adding that his son did not attend the session.
The minister went on to explain the incident and used a word that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya ordered to be expunged, as it was unparliamentary. The minister again said that he thought it was a proper Sinhala term used to identify persons of undisciplined features and added however, that there was no other fitting word to address some of the members of the joint opposition.
Later there was strong reaction from the opposition side and the use unparliamentary language, which was expunged by the Speaker. However many members shouted while Joint Opposition Member Tharaka Balasooriya and UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha expressed their views.
Order under Diplomatic Privileges Act moved by FM approved
Parliament yesterday, approved an Order under the Diplomatic Privileges Act moved by Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera to grant special privileges and immunities to several key international organizations.
Accordingly, International Water Management Institute, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees, Colombo Plan Bureau, International Labour Organization, International Committee of the Red Cross, World Conservation Union, Commission of the European Communities, Economic Development Co-operation Fund Representatives have been given a number of privileges and immunities, including certain customs and import duty waivers.
As of the Order approved by the House, the IWMI had been accepted as an autonomous, international, non-profit, research, educational and training organization. The Institute, its properties, premises, Director General, and staff, would be bound and protected by diplomatic immunity as per the law passed yesterday in Parliament.
Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva winding up the debate, said his Ministry was keen in promoting economic diplomacy to attract more Foreign Direct Investments to the country. We have 68 embassies around the world and we are annually spending about Rs 9,000 million to provide all facilities to the diplomatic missions working in them.
They should take every effort to bring in investments to the country. With this aim in mind, we are now providing a special training at Harvard University to 44 high ranking officials of the Foreign Service, he said.
Hoisting of black flags on sacred and historic day
JO members' politicalbankruptcy reflected: FM
The political bankruptcy of those Joint Opposition members is reflected by their intention of hoisting black flags on the sacred and historic day that commences the United Nations International Vesak Day Celebration in Sri Lanka on May 12, said Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday.
He made this observation, while moving the order under the Diplomatic Privileges Act when Parliamentarian Sydney Jayaratne questioned of the Joint Oppositions attempt to hoist black flags.
He added the government would not allow anybody to hoist black flags on Vesak Day, Christmas Day nor on the birthday of Prophet Muhammad.
"If they attempted to do so, they would only have to fill the Galle Face ground as they did last week for more than another ten years," Minister Samaraweera said.
Former First Lady's trip to Paris had cost Rs. 25 M
A sum of Rs 25 million had been spent for former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa to attend the United Nations International Vesak Day Celebration in 2014, said Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera in Parliament yesterday.
"Some people say that the United Nations Vesak Day Celebration was celebrated for the first time," Minister Samaraweera said. "It is not true. United Nation had celebrated Vesak Day in early years too. Former First Lady had travelled to Paris to participate in it in 2014."
Foreign Affairs Minister made these observations yesterday, moving the order under the Diplomatic Privileges Act.
He also said that she resided at the George the Fifth Hotel of which the charges were very high. He added that Queen Elizabeth too refused to reside there as the rates were too high.
"The cost of a single room was Euro 20,000," the Foreign Affairs Minister said. "We could question the school children to calculate and see how much was Euro 20,000 in Sri Lankan rupees. We can ask them as to how many halls and playgrounds could be built for them with that money."
He said that Grand Mother Daisy had also accompanied the First Lady on the same trip. "According to statistics of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the mini bar in the same room had been filled thrice the very night they stayed there.

Record-breaking Sydney FC put all on the line in decider
SYDNEY Friday: Sydney FC, coming off a record-breaking season with just one defeat, will put it all on the line against Melbourne Victory in Sundays Australian A-League grand final in Sydney.
The Sky Blues have been hailed the A-Leagues greatest team after finishing the regular season with a record 66 points from 20 wins in 27 games and 17 points ahead of the nearest rivals Victory.
Yet under the unique nature of Australian finals football, Sydney FC will have to beat Melbourne Victory for a fourth time this season to lift their third A-League championship.
Sydney FC dominated the Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) A-League team of the season with six players headed by the John Warren Medal winner and Serbian midfielder Milos Ninkovic as the leagues best player.
Graham Arnold, also named coach of the season by the PFA, is chasing his second A-League championship after winning with his former club Central Coast Mariners in 2012-13.
I dont think were bullish, Arnold said. I just think were confident and expect to win.
Its what we do every week. You couldnt imagine me standing here saying we expect to lose. Sydneys forward line, led by skipper Alex Brosque, Brazilian Bobo and Slovak Filip Holosko, have scored 34 goals between them, with playmaker Ninkovic chipping in with nine goals and 11 assists.
But it is Sydneys defence that has been the hallmark of their outstanding season with just 12 goals conceded in 28 league games.
Against all this, Victory are talking up their chances of upsetting Sydney on their own ground in the season decider.
If you look at all our games (against Sydney this season), weve had quite a lot of opportunities, we just couldnt take them, Socceroo midfielder James Troisi said.
I dont think its near impenetrable. They are vulnerable. Victorys hopes rest on their two strikers Besart Berisha and Marco Rojas to break Sydneys defensive shackles.
Kosovo striker Berisha, the A-Leagues all-time leading scorer with 101 goals, scored the only goal of their semi-final win over Brisbane Roar last week with his 20th strike of the season.
New Zealander Rojas, dubbed the Kiwi Messi for his trickery and attacking skills, has chimed in with 12 goals.
Melbourne Victory, coached by Kevin Muscat, will be bidding to become the A-Leagues all-time winners with their fourth championship if they surprise Sydney.

Reduction of MRs security detail not politically motivated: Sagala
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been provided a security contingent of 187 Police and STF personnel, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said.
The Minister, making a clarification on the matter raised by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament on Wednesday over the security of former President Rajapaksa, said 26 STF personnel trained on VIP security have been attached to the security contingent of Rajapaksa. He said the former President was given a security contingent of 229 Police and STF personnel, but this number was reduced by 42 following a threat assessment on VIPs. Threat assessments are conducted at regular intervals of six months. The reduction of numbers in the security detail of former President Rajapaksa was not politically motivated.
It was done by the IGP after a careful analysis. MP Dinesh Gunawardena spoke to me over this matter. If former President Rajapaksa wants additional security at any special event, we can make arrangements in that regard and deploy more security officers from the Ministerial Security Division (MSD) Minister Ratnayaka explained.
The minister said former President Chandrika Kumaratunga is given a security contingent of 59, adding that the security of MPs Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne and M.A. Sumanthiran have also been enhanced due to security risks.
NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa asked if the security of MP Sumanthiran was tightened due to LTTE threats, how the Government can claim that the security threat on former President Rajapaksa has lessened.
Was the IGP standing from his head when he conducted the threat analysis This is certainly a ploy to put former President Rajapaksas life in danger by gradually lessening his security, he accused.
Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera replying to this claim pointed out the Tamil extremists groups are protecting the Joint Opposition leaders with all their might as of the information received. Tamil separatists who want to disrupt the reconciliation process want the JO to fulfill their goals.
"Thus, they protect the JO with all their might, Minister Ratnayaka added.

Remembering great sons of Ananda
When Benjamin Franklin one of the foremost founding fathers of the American nation and also one of the leading signatories to the original constitution of the United States of America signed on the 17th September, 1987 returned to the USA from France where he had gone to discuss and strengthen the relationship between the two countries as Britain was opposed to the creation of the new nation, Benjamin Franklin was keen to known and ascertain whether there was any sign or symbol which would herald the success and prosperity of the new country which has just been established.
It was to Franklins great delight and happiness when he was told by his colleagues that at the time of the constitutional convention a wooden plaque depicting the picture of the rising Sun was attached to the Parchment paper on which the Constitution was inscribed which fact being indicative of the rise and prosperity of the new nation.
A hundred years later, on 01st November, 1986 when the Pettah Buddhist, English School was inaugurated at Maliban Street the roll of the original thirty seven students included C A Hewavitharana, a member of the illustrious Hewavitharana family which in itself was an auspicious beginning for the new school which needed such circumstances for its forward march. The schoolboy C A Hewavitharana later grew to be Dr C A Hewavitharana one of the countrys early patriots. The school was later renamed Ananda College to honour the memory of the Buddhas great and learned disciple Ven Ananda Thera.
When the school was shifted to Maradana in 1895 the original school that began with the blessings and support of the countrys learned and erudite monks also had the support of a few courageous and influential Buddhist leaders and always had the backing and encouragement of the Buddhist/Theosophists such as Colonel H S Olcott from New York in USA and Madam Blavatsky of Russia.
Leading Buddhist Educational Institution
The school that began with such goodwill and backing has to develop and progress and reach its goal to be not only a leading Buddhist Educational Institution but more importantly to be a National Institution which level it undoubtedly reached at least from the post independence period. The writer of this short piece had the good fortune and privilege to be a student from the time of the principalship of A B Perera (1944) and L H Mettananda 1945/1946 onwards till he entered the University of Ceylon in 1952.
During the middle of the 20th Century 1949/1950 some senior school teachers particularly V Keerthisinghe  Science and C M Weeraratne  Maths for some good reason were keen on obtaining a consensus of opinion as to who were the five most distinguished old Anandians and there was that consensus of opinion in respect of E A L Wijeswardena (Edwin Arthur Lewis) later being the Knighted as Sir Arthur Wijewardena as the most distinguished Old Anandians.
Sir Arthur Wijewardena was Attorney General of Ceylon 1937 and appointed as a Supreme Court Judge in January, 1938 and thus became the first Buddhist to be appointed a Supreme Court Judge and while the first Sinhalese to be appointed a Supreme Court Justice was Sir Harry Dias in the 1980s and Wijewardena who was appointed as Chief Justice in January, 1949 became the 1st Ceylonese to hold that much coveted office when Sir John Howard (a Britisher) who retired in December, 1948.
It is to the credit of Ananda College that Wijewardena of its star products created an unbeatable record when he was called upon to act for the Governor General, Lord Soulbury when he was on leave and thereby Wijewardena became the only Ceylonese to be the officer administering the Government.
It was left to G K W Perera who was a contemporary of Wijewardena at Ananda College and both of whom were pupils of the then Principal D B Jayathilake (1898 to 1909) later Sir Baron Jayatillake to be the first Anandian to win the Government scholarship which was annually granted by the Government to the two best students in Arts and Science which enable them to study abroad in England on a Government scholarship.
G K W Perera after he completed his studies in England was considered to be one of the most erudite and intelligent scholars produced by Ceylon.
British Colonial Government
In the 1930s in view of his overall standing and intellectual abilities he was elected to the Ceylon State Council. And as there was no diplomatic and/or foreign service for talented and able Ceylonese either to aspire to or be appointed as Ambassadors as Ceylon being only a crown colony of the British Empire at the time G K W Pereras great talents were recognized and was chosen as the first Trade Commissioner of Ceylon to Britain which was the highest appointment available to represent the country abroad in the same way D B Jayatillake (Sir Baron) the Minister of Home Affairs, Leader of the State Council and the Chairman of the Board of Ministers was appointed in 1943 as Ceylons first Trade Commissioner in India.
If G K W Perera is to be considered (and that there was the necessary consensus among the teachers and the senior students) as the second most distinguished old Anandian next to Sir Arthur Wijewardena the third place in the list of most distinguished old Anandians by general agreement was reserved for D J Wimalasurendra the father of Hydro Electricity in Ceylon and who by his own inventive genius studied how to meet the future needs of electric power long before even the British Colonial Government or the politicians in power or wanting to be in power had any concrete plans on the subject. Creative Engineer Wimalasurendra had made great plans including the future possibility to harness the natural resources in Luxapana and Norton Bridge area. Wimalasurendra championed the great cause to develop the need to obtain the maximum power supply by harnessing the available resources and he carried on his campaign even in the State Council as the member for Ratnapura.
It was not merely Ceylon/Sri Lanka but Ananda College itself had a great affinity toward Burma so much so that in the 1930s about half the players in the College Football team were students to who had come from Burma apart from many other students studying in the school and at one time two members of the Burmese Cabinet were old Anandians. It is in this context that one of Anandas most distinguished old boys happened to be U Chan Toon who became the Attorney General of Burma and later elevated to the rank of Chief Justice of Burma and subsequently ending up his carrier as Burmas permanent representative to the United Nations.
It is matter of great significance that in 1949 Chan Toon visited the school and in his short address at the invitation of the Principal Mettananda he recalled his days as a student and said that he had come to pay his debt to his old school and the distinguished at Jurist added that he was discharging his debt by admitting his own son to the school.
All concerned were unanimous that Chan Toon be named as the fourth most distinguished product of Ananda and as there was no consensus among those who mattered at the relevant time it is neither proper nor fair to mention who figured for the fifth place.
When the schools Diamond Jubilee (60 years) Prize Giving was held on 01st November, 1946 in the then College Hall, Dutugemunu Building, the school honoured its distinguished product Wijewardena who was then the senior puisne judge by inviting him to be the Chief Guest on which occasion the writer had the opportunity to attend to the prize giving not as a prize winner but as one of the half a dozen middle school boys selected to help in the days proceedings and the Jubilee Carnival held on 1st to 4th November, the elaborate arrangements for the success of which were in the capable hands of the two senior organisers  Senior Civil Servant M Chandrasoma who retired as the principal Collector of Customs and Ranjit Hewagama Senior Product of Colombo every loyal old Anandian. Wijewardena in his prize day speech recalled with gratitude the great benefits he has got by being an Anandian together with G K W Perera who competed for honours with him.
Government scholarship
Another significant fact in the life of Wijewardena was that after completing his studies on the basis of the government scholarship which he himself had won he sat the written examination for the recruitment of the candidates for the Ceylon Civil Service and at which written examination he topped the list by scoring a record number of marks and at the final Oral Interview for the selection the board of selectors wished Wijewardena Good Luck and advised him to look for another avenue for employment as his application was rejected on medical grounds and years later when the Ceylon press announced the appointment of Wijewardena in January 1949 as the first Ceylonese to be Chief Justice the press did not fail to mention how he fared at the oral examination and added further that what happened at the oral interview was a blessing in disguise.
The writer wishes to mention that the aforementioned four distinguished old Anandians were selected in that order on the basis of a criteria decided upon by some senior school teachers over sixty years ago taking into consideration (a) their learning and high academic and professional attainments; (b) the great honour and fame brought by them to the old school, (c) finally the contributions made by them to the social and national development of the country.
It is not unlikely that different persons may have different views as to what should be the criteria to be adopted in the first quarter of the 21st century when remarkable achievements in sports  cricket, athletics, swimming etc, even heroism in military activity very often take the centre stage.
What has been said in this article has been made with malice to none and is based on facts as transpired in the mid 19th century. Therefore there is no need for anyone to feel injured.

Antonian-Kingswood rugby clash

The Kingwoodians who went down to their rivals Dharmaraja in their last outing have effected key changes in their starting line for this clash, which has the ingredients of turning out to being a thriller. The Antonians are well in form after their last win and should play out their open brand of rugby. Kingswood too will be addressing themselves to the game with equal determination.
Rajans have edge over Vidyartha
The confrontation between the high riding Dharmaraja and Vidyartha ruggerites at Nittawela on Sunday points out to be a battle between the Rajans three-quarters and Vidyartha forwards. Rajans who are playing well, will depend heavily on their backs to deliver the goods, they are the ones who have paved the way for their last win against Kingswood.
Vidyartha are with a very young side, and in most of the matches they have done their best in the first four minutes, but in the second forty minutes have failed to keep it going. In this game their forwards will have a big say in their play.

Royal will go all out to down depleted Zahira
Royal college Colombo will go out with all guns blazing to down depleted Zahira college when they take on the Maradana school in their Singer ADivision inter-schools league rugby second round encounter at Zahira grounds in Maradana. Kick off will be at 4:30pm.
Reid Avenue boys, one of the strongest contenders this year for the Singer league title will be out for a bonus point win when they meet the wounded Zahira college who will miss the services of their play maker cum fly half Said Sinhawansa, hospitalised due to Dengue and will not play in this match. Incidentally he is the highest points scorer thus far in this years league rugby tournament.
Royal college coached by Isipathana old boy Sanath Martis, should have things their own way in this encounter. Fly half Ovin Askey will lead the Royal college outfit.
Isipathana goes out firm favourites to beat SThomas
High riding Isipathana College will go out as the firm favourites againstSThomas College Mount Lavinia in their Singer A Division inter schoolleague rugby tournament second round match to be played at Havelock Parktoday at 4:30pm.
The Pathana lads have a sensational record in this years ongoing league rugby tournament where they won six and only had a surprise loss to the unpredictable Peterites in the first round.
Their cause has been severely bolstered by the presence of their ever reliable forwards along with their speedy three quarter line who are scoring tries at will against all opponents through their famous three quarter moves. On the other hand S Thomas College possesses a good team with play maker and skipper Naveen Henakankanamge can play an outstanding game to bring victory to their school but has been blowing hot and cold and is feeling the sting of the last week defeat they had against arch rivals Royal College, hence this game will be a do or die battle for them aganst the formidable Pathana side.
Can Peterites turn table on Wesley
A close battle for supremacy can be expected today between third placed Wesley College and the giant killers St. Peters college, Bambalapitiya in the Singer A Division league rugby tournament second round match at Longden Place, kick off will be at 4:30 pm.
A mammoth crowd is expected at Longden Place to witness this grand game of the 2017 league rugby tournament. Wesley have to force a win to have any chance of clinching the A Division League rugby title for the first time as it has eluded them right through out their rugby history.
Todays match should turn out to be a battle between St. Peters power-packed forwards and Wesleys speedy three quarters. Peterite forwards have given a terrific display in the loose against unbeaten Trinity last week, where they pulled of a stunning win against all odds to beat the Kandy school by 15-13 and should maintain their supremacy in this game as well to pull off a stunner against the double blues.

Stop coal financing or jeopardise Asia's future
Friends of Earth warn ADB:
Friends of the Earth Asia Pacific released a report calling on the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to cease all funding of coal projects, saying that its current climate and energy policies are incompatible and hypocritical.
This year, the ADB turns 50. In the last decade alone, it has financed over US $3 billion in coal projects across the Asia Pacific region and was one of the largest international public financiers of coal. Friends of the Earth Asia Pacific, a network of environmental and social justice groups across the region said this must be stopped now if we are to avert dangerous climate change.
The Friends of the Earth report outlines the ADBs previous funding of coal projects, its current policy to financially support coal infrastructure and its incompatibility with climate commitments, including the 2015 Paris Agreement.
The ADBs claims to fully recognise the impact climate change will have on people in poverty in Asia are hypocritical. Their 2020 strategy points out that climate change is a fundamental threat to alleviating poverty in the Asian region, and will put the lives of millions of people in Asia at risk. Its energy policy disregards this, said Friends of the Earth Asia Pacific spokesperson Hemantha Withanage.
Coal is one of the greatest drivers of dangerous climate change, yet the ADB refuses to rule out financing new coal projects. Instead, it supports new coal fired power stations, coal infrastructure projects and prolong the life of old power stations by investing in retrofitting projects. None of this indicates a commitment to action to stop climate change.
The ADB is 50 years old, we are in the 21st century. We need a 21st century
energy policy. Renewable energy technologies are available to meet the energy needs of 21st century Asia. We need to put communities, and especially poor and marginalised communities first, by investing in community-led renewable energy projects that meet peoples needs while addressing our climate commitments.

Striking doctors available for private practice
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara brought to the attention of Parliament that the doctors who led the islandwide strike yesterday, had been continuing private practice at leading private hospitals.
The minister said GMOA President Dr. Anurudda Padeniya, who led the islandwide Trade Union action against the SAITM, had been available for private channelling yesterday.
Many innocent patients were inconvenienced due to the strike and the OPDs have been closed.
However, the same doctors who led the strike were available to obtain treatment after paying Rs. 1,925 as channelling fees. How ethical is this MP Ranjan Ramanayake has got an appointment from Dr.Padeniya at 4 p.m. at the Navaloka hospital. I have the documents to prove it, he said.
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake raising objections at that time questioned from the chair under which Standing Order that the minister was allowed to make such a statement. That statement should have come from either the subject minister or the Prime Minister. Anybody and everybody cannot be allowed to speak their minds out in the House in this manner, he said.
Intervening at this point, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the matter raised by Jayasekara was of national importance. Kiriella also said the strike was completely unsuccessful.
NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa claiming that the Government was making baseless allegations against the doctors involved in the strike asked the Government to prove the charge with evidence.
MP Dissanayake pointed out that doctors engaging in private practice while leaving the patients coming to state hospitals in the lurch is no difference to lecturers at the Sri Jayewardenapura Medical Faculty teaching at the SAITM while leaving the students in state universities in the lurch.

St. Josephs dished out a superb brand of attacking rugby and gave a torrid time to Trinity throughout the entire game but a quick try by Trinitys burly centre Warren Weerakoon and a penalty just before the final whistle cost Joes the match.
Trinity actually came from behind 15-20 midway into the second half to snatch victory beating St.Josephs by 30 points (5 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) to 25 (3 tries, 2 conversions, 2 penalties) in their Singer A Division inter-schools league rugby second round match played at Havelock Park yesterday.

Veteran Coates in bitter battle to stay AOC chief
Sydney Friday : Australian Olympic Committee chief John Coates faces an unprecedented challenge to his decades-long presidency from newcomer Danni Roche Saturday after a bitter campaign marred by bullying claims goes to a vote.
Coates, whose International Olympic Committee vice-presidency is attached to being AOC president, has held the powerful office for 27 years.
But in an acrimonious lead-up to the AOC annual general meeting in Sydney there have been allegations of a culture of bullying and intimidation inside the lavishly resourced body.
Australias 40 Olympic sports, 11 AOC executive members and two delegates from the AOC athletes commission will decide whether to entrust the future of the countrys Olympic movement to Roche or keep it in the hands of long-serving incumbent Coates.
Roche, 46, a former Atlanta Olympic field hockey gold medallist and board member of the federal government-backed Australian Sports Commission (ASC), has campaigned for change in the AOC, saying the administration is dictatorial and bloated
Roche has also said she plans to cut costs and redirect money to athletes and underfunded sports in a shake-up of AOC culture.
One bone of contention is the more than Aus$700,000 (US$526,000) annual salary for Coates, who is also chairman of the co-ordination committee of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
I am deeply concerned about the culture at the Australian Olympic Committee, Roche said.
On the day I announced I was standing for the role, I made a commitment to reset the philosophy and culture of the AOC.
The need for change at the AOC is now clear. It needs to change, and it needs to change now.
Coates, 66, points to his achievements as the AOC president.
He secured the 2000 Olympics Games for Sydney and helped build an Australian Olympic Fund which is now worth more than Aus$140 million and keeps the AOC financially secure and independent from federal government interference.
I have a history of having a go, Coates said. Someone has to go out there and fight for the sports.
A backdrop to the acrimonious square-off between Coates and Roche is the breakdown of the relationship between the AOC and the ASC, that funds the preparation of Australias Olympic teams.
They are appointed by ministers to the ASC. Im not. The AOC is independent, Coates said.
Allegations of bullying have been splashed across Australias front pages, mostly linked to Coates right-hand man and media chief Mike Tancred as the AOC faces increased public scrutiny.
Former AOC chief executive Fiona de Jong brought one claim, alleging Tancred issued a highly detailed and personal threat against her.
Tancred has denied any wrongdoing but stepped aside while an independent commission rules on de Jongs bullying complaint, which dragged Coates operating style into the spotlight.
Roche said she expects a close result in Saturdays poll.
I think the vote will be very, very close, I think it will come down to the wire, Roche told reporters Friday.
It has been a very big six weeks but a special six weeks. I have had the opportunity to speak to all of the sports about their challenges and opportunities.

Windies level series as Pakistan fall under Gabriels spell
Bridgetown: Shannon Gabriel produced an outstanding effort of consistently fast bowling to lead the West Indies to a 106-run victory over Pakistan 80 minutes after lunch on the final day of the second Test at Kensington Oval in Barbados on Thursday.
Set a target of 188 after leg-spinner Yasir Shah's seven for 94 wrapped up the home side's second innings at 268 at the start of the day, the tourists were never in contention after the pace barrage on a deteriorating pitch led by Gabriel, whose innings figures of five for 11 contributed to Pakistan's demise for just 81 off 34.4 overs.
It equalled the lowest total ever in a Test innings at the venue set by India, also in a losing effort chasing 120, against the West Indies in 1997 and leaves the series at 1-1 going into the final Test in Dominica starting next Wednesday.
Troubled by injuries and no-balls throughout his comparatively brief career, the burly fast bowler earned the Man of the Match award with overall figures of nine for 92, the third-best by a West Indian against Pakistan.
Only wicketkeeper-batsman Sarfraz Ahmed and fast bowler Mohammad Amir, who contributed 23 each, offered any resistance to Gabriel, Alzarri Joseph (two for 42) and Jason Holder (three for 23), the West Indies captain having the satisfaction of taking the final wicket when Ahmed was caught by Roston Chase on the long-on boundary to trigger the Caribbean sides celebrations.
"We knew we had a chance once we got a lead over 150," said Gabriel as he savoured the success.
"I just concentrated on bowling the right areas at pace and everything worked out for me and the team. This was a total team effort."
Gabriel started the rout with the wicket of first innings century-maker Azhar Ali as the opening batsman miscued an attempted pull for Shimron Hetmyer to take a diving catch at midwicket.
Joseph, sharing the new ball with Gabriel, struck in the very next over when Babar Azam flicked at a leg-side delivery for wicketkeeper Shane Dowrich to snare the chance and consign Pakistans brightest batting talent to the indignity of a pair.
Joseph should have also accounted for Ahmed Shehzad but the opening batsman, who enjoyed generous slices of luck in scoring 70 in the first innings, was missed at first slip edging an attempted drive.
That disappointment was replaced by even more jubilation in the West Indies camp though, as Holder replaced Gabriel and immediately earned the prized scalp of Younis Khan. Adjudged LBW by on-field umpire Richard Kettleborough, Younis challenged the decision only to have it confirmed by the television replays.
With Joseph tiring, Gabriel was recalled into action to replace the gangling Antiguan and the burly Trinidad and Tobago tearaway responded with two critical wickets in the space of three deliveries.
Captain Misbah ul Haq was first ruled not out to vociferous appeals but replays following a challenge showed an inside-edge that lobbed to Shai Hope at gully and sent the Pakistan captain back to the pavilion without scoring.
He was joined just a few minutes later by Asad Shafiq when the new batsman edged his second delivery for Powell to take the catch at first slip at the third attempt.
"West Indies deserve all the credit for the way their bowlers performed today but I felt we let the match get away from us by letting them get so many runs in the second innings," said Misbah.
"Our intention was to bat normally and put away the scoring opportunities but they never really came early enough for us to get going."
Pakistan were in danger of their lowest-ever total when Shehzad and Shadab Khan fell shortly after lunch at 36 for seven. However Ahmed and Amir took them past the ignominious low of 49 in a 42-run stand that only delayed the inevitable. Gabriel was brought back into the attack to the break the partnership with the wicket of Amir and completed a five-wicket innings haul when he bowled Shah for the fourth duck of the innings.
It was then left to Holder to finish off the match with the wicket of Ahmed even if it meant denying Gabriel a first ten-wicket match haul in Test cricket. AFP
