Asia Cup debacle: Lanka slumps from hero to zero in T20 rankings

Not so long ago Sri Lanka were enjoying top Twenty20 status as the world champions in that format and being number one in the ICC Twenty20 rankings.
But over the last three months series defeats against New Zealand (0-2) and India (1-2) and following the Asia Cup debacle in Bangladesh where they won only one match (against UAE) out of four has seen Sri Lanka slump from number one slot in the ICC T20 rankings to a staggering eighth place days before the start of the ICC World Twenty20 in India where they are supposed to defend the title they won in 2014.
This is an unbelievable slump for a national team in the rankings and mind you being the current world T20 champs.
It shows the current form they are in and gives little in confidence to anyone following Sri Lanka cricket.
The countries below Sri Lanka are apart from Bangladesh and Zimbabwe all associated nations. Afghanistan are the nearest to Sri Lanka in ninth position.
India who won the Asia Cup on Sunday beating Bangladesh in the final confirmed their status as the number one ranked team going into the World Twenty20 tournament where they will be the hosts.
India is on 127 points, nine points clear of 2012 winner West Indies and South Africa, who are on equal points (118). New Zealand is fourth on 116, followed by 2010 winner England in fifth, 2010 losing finalist Australia in sixth, 2009 champion Pakistan in seventh and defending champion Sri Lanka in eighth.
These eight sides qualified directly for the second round after finishing inside the top eight of the ICC T20I Rankings as on 30 April 2015.
Since the ICC World Twenty20 Bangladesh 2014, India has played 16 matches and has won 11, including 10 out of 11 T20Is this year. This is in stark contrast to Sri Lanka who since winning the World T20 title in 2014 has won only four of the 14 matches played since then  and lost 10. ST

Chaos at SLC over selection policy

On the eve of the Sri Lanka cricket team's departure to the ICC World Twenty20 in India tonight mayhem and confusion over selection differences has arisen between Sri Lanka Cricket administrators and the current national selectors.
There was further speculation that the Sports Minister has changed the current set of selectors and a new selection committee has been appointed yesterday night to make whatever changes that needs to be done to the already picked squad of 15.
As to how a new selection committee can make changes or pick a squad for a T20 World Cup without any sort of knowledge and in-depth study on the players' performance is questionable.
However we do not have confirmation to the effect that the current selection committee has been removed to give way to a new selection committee. We could not verify this from the chairman of selectors Kapila Wijegunawardene who could not be contacted yesterday.
Nevertheless we reliably understand that approaches have been made to high profile past cricketers like Sanath Jayasuriya and Roshan Mahanama who for reasons best known to them have turned down the offer and the names put forward subsequently for the Minister's approval are Aravinda de Silva (chairman), Lalith Kaluperuma, Romesh Kaluwitharana and Ranjith Madurasinghe. This committee is expected to function for 40 days.
The whole issue came up when Sri Lanka T20 captain appointed for the World Cup Lasith Malinga informed SLC on his return from Bangladesh that he was stepping down from the captaincy to undergo treatment to his injured left knee and that he would not be able join the team till March 15. Sri Lanka's opening match of the World T20 is on March 17 at Kolkata. The idea was to retain Malinga in the squad of 15 so that he would be able to join them later.
However the Daily News reliably learns that the national selectors had acted on a report from team physio Steven Mount on Malinga's fitness and dropped him from the squad and replaced him with Kasun Rajitha. Further it is learnt that the selectors had appointed Dinesh Chandimal to captain the team to the World T20.
These decisions have not gone down well with the SLC hierarchy who feel that the national selectors have ignored repeated requests to follow certain guidelines laid down by them and they have subsequently sought a change of the national selection committee even though their appointed term does not cease until the end of March.
We do not know whether this tantamount to interference by the administrators on national selections as the national selectors are answerable only to the Minister of Sport who appoints them based on the recommendations given to them by SLC.
This new selection committee following the approval of the Minister of Sport was to sit last night and pick the team for the World T20 in concurrence with the coach and captain.
It is learnt that Malinga will be retained in the 15-member squad and Angelo Mathews asked to lead Sri Lanka in the World T20 tournament.
Initially the current selectors picked a 15-member squad for both the Asia Cup and the World T20 however it is learnt that changes can be made to the World T20 team as the deadline for teams playing in the second round of the tournament is March 8 (today).
Sri Lanka underwent a disastrous Asia Cup in Bangladesh where they managed a solitary win over associate member country UAE out of four matches and failed to defend the title they won in 2014 by not qualifying for the final.
It is sad to note that an underperforming World Cup squad has been put into further confusion by what is happing within the current set of administrators. It has certainly caused a certain amount of anxiety and uncertainty amongst the players who are unaware of whether they are selected or not. How this team is expected to perform is a further mystery as they have a tough task in having to defend the trophy they won two years ago.

Dharshani - a hockey player with tremendous potential

Twenty five year old Dharshani Herath from the quiet village of Kudugala off Ambatenna along the Kandy - Matale highway is a hockey player with tremendous potential who made it to the Sri Lanka women's hockey team through perseverance, dedication and hard work.
Speaking to this writer Dharshani Herath said that there is hardly any sport in her village except a little softball cricket in the paddy fields after harvest and also the villagers play a little volleyball. Amazingly she was quite fluent in English - a language she had picked in school and later developed it on her own. She has the talent to give impromptu speeches in English to suit the occasion. She is the classic example of Ned Miller's immortal hit "Do what you do, do well boy" Her command of the Queen's language is good - a language she could hardly use in her village or at home. But she has mastered it on her own.
She has represented the country as a right half in many international matches and now plays for the champion Sri Lanka navy team.
She said that she attended Seetha Devi Balika Vidyalaya in Kandy and often had to travel in three buses to reach her school. From Kudugala she had to walk a few kilometres to Ambatenna if the bus from village to Kandy is not available or she had missed it due to it being full to capacity. From Kandy to her school at Mulgampola she had to take another bus. All this is time consuming and often she had to leave home before the first streaks of sunlight fall. The same hassle is there when returning home after hockey practices. Fortunately her good friend Geethani Abeyratne was with her and they struck up a bond of friendship which is growing strong every day.
She said one day while playing in the school compound during the short interval her hockey coach M A M Ashroff spotted her and wanted to know whether she would like to play hockey. Since this opportunity had been offered to her, she grabbed it with both hands. "I was just around ten years and being a girl brought up in a village environment or sylvan surroundings I had to get the approval of my parents which I did as I was able to convince them".
She played for the schools under 13 team for three years and captained it for one year in which they did well winning the Kandy District championship title and also performed well at the all island championship. Next she represented her school in the under 15 and under 17 tournaments and for two years the under 19 team. She played for the under 19 team for two years.
She said that getting a place in the Seetha Devi Balika vidyalaya's hockey team was a tough task as it was oozing with talent and when they were winning trophies after trophies it was difficult to displace the regulars as they had established themselves. But still she played for the Central Province schools in 2011 she represented the Sri Lanka Schools at the Junior Asiad held in Thailand. Her play came in for much praise. Her next international representation was Women's Asiad held in Singapore. She represented Seetha Devi Sports Club at the Singapore Sixes held in Kuala Lumpur in 2009 and they finished runner up and two years later they won the championship.
She has also represented the Kandy District at women's nationals and has been a regular member of Seetha Devi Sports Club which fielded a full complement of national players.
Since 2009 she has been representing the Sri Lanka Navy and the Defence Services. In fact last year she was in the Navy women's team which won the womens nationals for the first time. She has also represented the country at the Asian Challengers Trophy and the World League championships in the recent years. She paid a glowing tribute to her hockey coach M A M Ashroff who identified her talent chiselled her skills and made her play in the right berth as right half where goal scoring opportunities are few. But she said the halves make the ground work for the flankers and the forwards to do the scoring. They have an important role to play in both attack and defence. She hopes to continue her hockey for many more years. Her employers Sri Lanka Navy give her all the encouragement and guidance and here too her coach is Ashroff.

Enchanting 'Ella'

Do fairies, wicked witches, ogres, tree monsters, dungeons and dragons really dwell in this world or in the universe for that matter Do giants really roam on clouds as told in fairytales Are fairytales mere works of imagination or do they shed light on an unknown past and an unpredictable future
Fairytales apart, how are we going to explain the monster-like phenomenon recently witnessed by an airplane passenger on clouds Let us find answers to these topics later and now focus our attention on a magically woven story unfolded on stage recently at the BMICH.
'Ella Disenchanted' the drama restaged by the students of Devi Balika Vidyalaya as a public show after eight years surely caught the attention of all who were present. Confident and versatile young Devians of the school's English Literary Association presented the drama.
One would have wondered whether he or she is witnessing a live stage drama or one of the latest Hollywood films. Precision in acting, choreography and direction with mesmerizing backdrops, costumes and digital music all rolled into one has brought to the fore an enchanting piece of art. Devi Balika's newest version has elevated Ella's story to a level that is on par with world standards or broadway.
Chief Guest of the event veteran playwright Namel Weeramuni said, "These girls did a marvelous job. They have immense talent in abundance. I was mesmerized by their act".
Ella's story originally appeared in a novel written by Gail Carson Levine. In 2004 the big screen version of Ella's story as 'Ella Enchanted' was released. This was a fantasy romantic comedy that cast Anne Hathaway as Ella and Hugh Dancy as Prince Charmont.
Devi Balika's version of Ella's story however comes with the name, 'Ella Disenchanted'. Ella's story has similarities to Cinderella. Cursed at birth by Lucinda the mislead fairy, Ella becomes a child who must obey everyone's commands. To add more misery to this gift of obedience, Ella's mother dies giving birth to Ella leaving little Ella totally insecure in a cruel world. On her deathbed Ella's mother warns her child to keep Lucinda's curse a secret. Eventually her stepmother and stepsisters bring more misery to Ella's life. Having had enough, young Ella now grown to become a beautiful damsel decides to take matters into her own hands. A runaway Ella encounters in the outside world more cruelty. But also finds friends, romance and many more privileges.
Amaya Senarathne who portrays Ella's character does a wonderful job on stage. Her acting talents are superb. With her facial expressions she sheds light on the raw talent that is in abundance with youngsters in this country that if polished could be kept on par with international level.
Amaya's peers in the play too perform exceptionally well. Each and every actor does her task with utmost sincerity. Thus the drama seemed flawless.
A special appreciation should be given to Vishan Gunawardena the young director of 'Ella Disenchanted'. Vishan with his direction has taken Sri Lankan drama to the next level. He is supported well by Shala Amarasuriya as the choreographer. Music makers, sound editors and backstage crew have added immense value to the play.
'Ella Disenchanted' is produced by Javin Thomas. All these resourceful youngsters with the young thespians of Devi Balika Vidyalaya have teamed up to do a wonderful job. Bravo!

Tests your power of endurance

Ever since Marvel launched its 'Avenger' series superhero movies seem to be in the newest success formula for Hollywood movies. Now after productions like 'Ironman', 'Captain America', 'Wolverine', 'Spiderman', 'The Incredible Hulk' etc comes the latest addition to the fad, 'Deadpool'.
We have encountered the being with regenerative powers before in 'Wolverine'. However the protagonist of the newest superhero movie is poles apart from the one we met in the previous production.
Based on a script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, the non-linear comic book film recounts the life and times of Wade Wilson, a mouthy ex-Special Forces operative turned sociopathic mercenary who finds his world forever changed when he meets the beautiful Vanessa, a prostitute whose entire life has been the same level of dark and awful as Wade's. The couple draw close but then tragedy strikes!
Talkative and quick-witted, Wilson opens the movie by choosing a name for himself and in costume. Then a series of flashbacks takes us on a horror ride to show him in pre-disfiguring mutation. Once he discovers that he is riddled with cancer, Wilson does not give up life without a fight. He submits himself to an experimental, off-the-books treatment which grants him powers but also severe disfigurement. He swears revenge on Ajax and all sorts of merry mayhem follows.
No big names
Tim Miller, who did the title sequence for 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' makes a directorial debut with Deadpool. What Deadpool is up to is less important than the quips he makes as he's doing it. He is a perfect example of a character who doesn't need world-threatening danger to foil. This is where the movie fails because some of the best moments are restricted to incidents like Deadpool wondering whether it'll be James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart in charge at the X-Mansion.
In Marvel movies, 'Deadpool' has one of the smallest budgets, with no big name stars. The filmmakers try to use humor to turn this into a positive production. However the jokes are a huge let down and hardly bring o the laughs. On paper, it sounds like a lot of fun. Though the film starts out strong with a cheeky self-awareness, this starts to wear thin very quickly. If you're into raunchy and over the top humor, this film is for you.
The violence is carried out with such smirking glee that it becomes a bit uncomfortable to watch. This makes the entire experience a trying one, especially for the uninitiated who are not familiar with the character's unique take on superheroes, and who might be blindly expecting another 'Avengers' or 'X-Men'.
Refreshing in genre
The background is pretty much the same as what we found in the 'X-Men' franchise. However 'Deadpool' is at least refreshing in its willingness to try something new. It is unlike anything we've really seen before in the genre. No heroes are born. No worlds are ending. No cities are destroyed.
Ryan Reynolds is good though as he portrays Wilson, fulfilling all that's required of him in a role where he must surpass at everything, whether standing up, horizontal in air or lying down. Morena Baccarin is tolerable as Vanessa.
Deadpool's script has spent about five years on the shelf waiting to get made. Now that it is finally out the move is going to endure a whole new audience to the vivid and weird character. However, whether it is worth the wait, only the box office figures will tell.
