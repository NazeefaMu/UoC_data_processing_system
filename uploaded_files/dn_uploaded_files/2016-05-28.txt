Sangakkara hails impact of England coaches Bayliss and Farbrace
Kumar Sangakkara has lauded the impact Trevor Bayliss and Paul Farbrace have had on the England team over the past year, suggesting their contrasting coaching styles have made them an ideal combination to take the side forward.
Legendary wicketkeeper-batsman Sangakkara, 38, captained Sri Lanka in all formats during Bayliss and Farbraces time as head and assistant coach respectively.
It was a tenure which saw them complete Test series victories over England, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and New Zealand, and finish runners-up in two World Cups and the World Twenty20.
The 134-Test veteran, who averages 61 for newly-promoted Surrey in the County Championship this season after retiring from international cricket last year, has been impressed with Englands upturn in form with Bayliss and Farbrace at the helm and points to their complementary coaching methods as a contributing factor.
They were an outstanding combination for Sri Lanka, and have been an outstanding combination for England, Sangakkara told Sportsmail.
They are different and complement each other. Trevor is very to the point, very direct. Hes very honest and communicates very well with players, and stays in the background and only steps in when its absolutely necessary. Whereas Farby is all about being organised and covering all bases, making sure that every little detail is taken care of.
England appear to have a relatively straightforward summer schedule, with a three-match Test series against Sri Lanka preceding four home Tests against Pakistan in July and August.
Winning five of these matches would see them leapfrog Pakistan and India to second in the ICC Test rankings  narrowly behind world No 1 Australia.
England were a lowly fifth when Peter Moores was sacked in May 2015, and an ascent to second place over a year would be some achievement for the Bayliss-Farbrace administration. But this would come as no surprise to Sangakkara.
Theyre an ideal combination and theyre both wonderful people, which makes them even better coaches  it is no shock to see them doing so well now, the Sri Lankan continued.
Theyve done an amazing job for England so far and, believe me, its only going to get better. DAILY MAIL

Bjorn Borg: Tennis is one of the cleanest sports
It's been a trying start to the year for tennis, with match-fixing allegations and Maria Sharapova's failed drugs test putting the sport into the headlines for all the wrong reasons.
Despite these controversies, in a rare interview with CNN Open Court, Swedish tennis great Bjorn Borg said the game still shapes up to be one of the cleanest sports.
Sooner or later [this] would come up in tennis too, the 11-time grand slam winner told CNN's Pat Cash on Tuesday. I think tennis has been very protected for many years.
Slowly it's been coming ... [there have been] illegal things in other sports. I'm not surprised that this happened in tennis, he said.
One sport mired in doping allegations is athletics. Last week it emerged the FBI and federal prosecutors are investigating allegations of widespread doping by Russian athletes.
When it comes up it's always a big question mark. But I think it's good; I know that they check the players regularly, added Borg, referring to tennis anti-doping program.
All these question marks, they have to solve those, but I think tennis is one of the cleanest sports anyway.
Widely considered to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time, Borg said these issues offered the sport an opportunity to look at its regulatory policies.
We want to protect our sport, he said. We love our sport, so we want it to be clean. In one way it's good it came up so they can solve the problems [that] are in the sport right now.
Borg dominated tennis during the 1970s, winning five consecutive Wimbledon championships and six French Opens before retiring at the age of 26. Now 59, he spoke to fellow Wimbledon champion Pat Cash in Stockholm for CNN Open Court, due to air in June.

Royal College Colombo and St.Peters College Bambalapitiya will feature in their Singer Inter-school Division 1 League Rugby Tournament second round match for the B.C.Anghie trophy, at Royal Sports Complex in Reid Avenue today at 4.30 pm.
The Royalists have brought in former centre Lennox Calyaneratne to play in the pivotal position of fly half at the expense of this seasons vice captain Ashok Wijekumar who is shifted to play in his pet position as scrum half.
In the pack Royal skipper Nikila Gunadheera will play as number eight. Ayesh Maduranga and Mohamed Nabeel will bind in the front row with hooker Azmir Fajudeen.

In the set scrums the experienced Peterite hooker Ravin Yapa should get the better of his vis-a-vis Fajudeen while the line outs should be shared between the Royal duo of Lokugamage and Madumewan and Peterites Delpachithra and Gurusinghe.
Royals new halves combination comprising Wijekumar and Calyaneratne have been playing together. All will depend on how they will click as a pair in this crucial match. Peterites will hope that their vice captain cum scrum half Avishka Heenpella will pair off well with his new fly half Steven Sivaraj.

This is in addition to the experienced centre Theekshana Dasanayake who has stood out with his powerful runs down the flank as full back cum captain Sandesh Jayawickrama is there to join the line and form the overlap.

Saracens Hodgson eyeing dream double in Exeter finale
LONDON, FRIDAY: Charlie Hodgson will aim to pull down the curtain on his illustrious rugby career in his typical ultra professional way at Twickenham on Saturday.
That will be by making sure his own personal farewell party is just a side show to Saracens attempt to complete the dream club double.
Having already secured the European crown with a resolute victory over Dan Carter and Racing 92 in Lyon, Mark McCall's North Londoners go hunting domestic glory in the Aviva Premiership Final against Exeter Chiefs.
The current holders are red hot favourites to prove the best of English once more with Chiefs arriving from their Devon-base for their first Play-off shoot-out appearance in front of a full Twickenham house.
And Hodgson, a true Premiership great and fly-half who played the role of frustrated international understudy to Jonny Wilkinson for so long, is determined to bow out in the manner which has brought him so much respect and admiration within the game as an impressive No10 figure all these years.
Hodgson would have won many more than his 38 England caps had Wilkinson not been around in the same era plus added to that a fair share of injury problems. The 35-year-old, who joined from Sale Sharks in 2011, admits: It would be incredible to sign off with the double. .

Last-gasp Savea gives Canes win over Highlanders
WELLINGTON, FRIDAY: Ardie Savea returned from suspension to score a crucial, last-gasp try as the Wellington Hurricanes beat the Otago Highlanders 27-20 to boost their Super Rugby play-off hopes on Friday.
Savea, one of five players dropped last week for missing a team curfew, scored twice, his second in the final minute, as the Hurricanes ran in three tries to two in a rematch of last year's final.
The win puts the Hurricanes two points ahead of the Highlanders in the ultra-competitive New Zealand conference, where the battle for finals spots is set to go down to the wire.
It also gives the Hurricanes some revenge after their heartbreaking loss to the Highlanders in the 2015 final, the last time they hosted Otago at Westpac Stadium.
Skipper Dane Coles said the Hurricanes were finally finding last year's red-hot form and it was a shame Super Rugby was heading into an international break after this round. It's unfortunate we have a break but we'll take a lot of confidence from this, he said, after the high-tempo contest despite wet conditions in Wellington. Once we come back we've got a big challenge and every game's a must-win for us.
The Hurricanes were bolstered by the return of the five suspended players, who included Julian Savea and his uncapped brother Ardie. Both appear set to be named Sunday in the All Blacks squad for the upcoming three-Test series against Wales.
Cory Jane, another returnee from the naughty corner, also excelled, playing a part in the Hurricanes first two tries. The 53-Test winger, who last played for the All Blacks in November 2014, is tipped to head to Japan at the end of the season if he is omitted from the squad to face Wales.
He sparked the opening try in the 13th minute when his break on the wing started an attack that culminated in Ardie Savea racing past his markers to dot down between the posts.
Jane was involved again when TJ Perenara burst from the back of a scrum and the winger flicked the ball on to Brad Shields for the Hurricanes second five-pointer.
Lima Sopoaga clawed one back for the Highlanders, powering through Victor Vito's tackle after Malakai Fekitoa's run set him up.
Sopoaga almost created another with an audacious backwards chip kick but the Highlanders lost possession and went into the break trailing 17-7.They caught the Hurricanes napping early in the second half, with Dan Lienert-Brown scoring a try two minutes after the restart.
With the scores locked at 20-20 in the final minutes, a wayward Beauden Barrett penalty kick appeared to have squandered the Hurricanes chance of victory. AFP

Defending champs Kandy SC aim for Sevens heaven
Every year inter club Sevens Rugby is one of the sports biggest tournaments to Sri Lanka which the city of Colombo conducts and enjoys. Eight of the best clubs in the country will face off on this day with some clubs fielding two teams , which will be invaded by fans from every corner of Kandy and Colombo. Once again the SLRFU should plan a good days rugby.
Kandy Sports Club who are the defending champions, who won the inter club League and the knockout title this season are gearing up for the inter club Sevens tournament , which is expected to be held in August, They will all be up against competitive seasoned Sevens players who will don rival jerseys for their respective sides at an event that has gathered momentum over the years.
The inter club sevens tournament was first held in 1976 in Colombo , where Havelock SC who beat CH and FC 30-0 were the very first champions with Trinity College taking the schools title. . Since then the tournament has been held every year (except once or twice) and held at various venues and also at one time in Kandy.
Kandy Sports Club first won the sevens championship in 1999 under Harris Omar and thereafter on many occasions. So this time some of the key players like Nigel Ratwatte, , Shehan Pathirane, Gyan Weerarthne, Aunuruda Willwera, Lavanga Perera are recovering from injuries. Any way they have some good sevens players like Roshan Weerarthne, Srinath Sooriyabandara, Vishvamithra Jayasinghe, Soyuru Anthony, Arshad Jamaldeen, Anushka Gyan, Buwaneke Udaagamuwa to name a few. So, it will be ideal if they can invite Fazil Marija who is now involved with the national sides coaching to take over the Sevens team together with Saliya Kumara. Last time it was Saliya Kumar who coached the sevens team and they beat Havelock SC in the final under the captaincy of Fazil Marija. Today Sevens rugby is very popular in the country and Sri Lanka has a long history in the sevens field. It was in 1931 that the first sevens rugby game was played, that was in Ratnapura. The man who did everything possible to see to the kick off was K.F. Jenkins a Welshman. That game was between the Policemen and planters of the area. In 1941 the first ever major sevens tournament was held for Layard Cup.
Then in 1947 to mark the 25th year of CR & FC, Sydney de Zoysa and Winne Searasinghe came out with a tournament. It was CH & FC the first club to win a international sevens tournament that was the All India Sevens tournament in 1968. The side was led by John Burrows and together with Omar Sheriff made things easy for the winners. Kandy Sports Club under Lasantha Wijayasuriya won the 1997 All Pakistan Sevens.
Suri Rajan 10th life member of Kandy Club
Century old Kandy Clubs live wire BDR Suri Rajan was proposed as the 10th honorary life member by another senior member Srilal Wickremarthne. Suri as he is popularly known is a top class sports promoter and gives a big hand for sports in Kandy and in the club. His late father P.T. Rajan is the one who introduced hockey to Kandy.
Rauff Hakeem is keen to give Kandy Football a fillip
Former Royal College and Law College sportsman Rauff Hakeem who is now a minister, after reading my last Saturdays article in the Daily News, Does anybody care for Kandys Football says that football is one of the most popular games and played by most of our countrymen, and he is willing to come forward to give a helping hand to promote the game in the Hill Capital.While thanking the Minister for showing concern he should see that the game is promoted in the correct way, Though there is no football played at club level, coaches and referees are having seminars.
Kandys sports lovers to start Health and fitness programmes
Staying fit is a great bonus in life and can lead you to be a happy and healthier person. By staying fit and healthy you not only look and feel better but you decrease your chance of medical problems such as diabetes, heart attacks, high cholesterol and hypertension. There are many helpful strategies to keep fit and stay healthy that, with dedication and ambition, can be done if proper guidance is given. So Kandys sports lovers are going to start a keep fit programme which is badly needed.
What I feel is to keep fit, one must Start walking or jogging . No matter what your speed is, walking, jogging and also cycling are important parts of a healthy lifestyle as they activate to keep your muscles active and your blood flowing. If you need to keep your knees strong or have body aches and pains then this sort of sport is the best. Come up with a daily walking, and jogging routine that fits with your schedule (i.e. go for a jog everyday). After a while you can increase your distance, speed and eventually time. For example, walk to work, school, marketing and sporting events. If you live close enough to work or school a good solution would be to start walking .
Sportsmen to meet Sports Minister
Kandy's football, cricket and hockey orgaizers have declined recently at club level to meet the sports minister. All these sports are in total disarray. A great effort is needed to bring back these sports to the standard where they were.
Minister Lakshman Kiriella is keen to give a helping hand. Looking back these three sports flourished earlier but now, sad to say, no one knows what is happening. Holding office alone is not sufficient, but those in office should promote the sport, nowadays they are more keen in coaching, umpiring and involved sports equipment.
Now, there are handful of sports promoters who have decided to meet the Sports Minister through Kandys sporting Minister Lakshman Kiriella to bring back the sports to the position where it was. It is important that those holding office at club level in the three sports get going to promote their respective sport, particularly because, unlike in the past where funding was a problem, now there are a number of corporate entities who are prepared to support any sport that is managed by clubs whose committees are comprised of those who have the knowledge of the subject they handle and could be trusted to work in the best interest of the sport.
Jayasinghes Badminton Academy doing well
Former national badminton player Thilini Jayasinghe who was the first Sri Lankan woman to qualify from the sport for Olympic Games, a product of Mahamaya Girls College Kandy. Gives a big hand to keep the sport alive over here in Kandy.
Thilini was selected on performances at 10 international meets where she was ranked 45th from a total of 48 contestants at the Beijing Games. She is a South Asian games medalist and also took part in Asian games and Commonwealth games .
Her main aim is to bring up the sport and produce good talented players both in boys and girls events. Like many other sports badminton was introduced to our country by the advent of British well over 100 years ago. Its on record that the first Badminton Club was formed in 1909 in Radella at Dimbulla ACC where rugby and circlet was the most popular . It was in 1950 that Badminton Association of Ceylon was formed and first Senior National Men & Women Championships were conducted in the year 1953. Today, the Badminton could boast over 5000 taking part at the school level.
Over here in Kandy, at present Thilini Jayaisnghe gives a big hand to promote the game with limited facilities. She has nearly one hundred students from under 1 5 to 19 in her academy which is being coincided at Peradeniya University Gymnasium for both boys and girls. This is the biggest in the hills. She is being assisted by former Dhamraraja College player Harsha Perera. What she needs today is a good backing from the Sports Ministry, to keep the game alive and active.
Two good rugby games today
As the 2016 inter school cricket season enters the second round with two interesting games are on the card for today Saturday over here in the hills. At Pallekelle Trinity will entertain the enterprising Science College in the Cup game while the Vidyartha side will clash with Lumbini in the Bowl at Pallekelle.

Davids hat-trick bid carries her into last four of World Series finals
DUBAI, THURSDAY: Nicol David, the most successful female squash player of the professional era, kept alive her hopes of winning yet another major title by beating Nouran Gohar, the world junior champion, 11-7, 11-9 to qualify for the last four of the PSA World Series finals.
The eight-time world champion from Malaysia made light of any difficulties she may experience with the two-inch lower tin which has altered the tactical emphases of the womens game, moving the ball around well, usually picking good moments to play the ball in short, and coping with the hectic helter-skelter into which the rallies sometimes developed.
David also resisted a dangerous-looking fight-back which took the hard-hitting Egyptian to a 9-8 lead in the second game, and won the match with a penalty point after a Gohar drive lurched into the middle allowing David no room in which to play the ball.
This format really makes you stay in the moment, David said of the best-of-three-game group matches, in which her two wins and one loss carried her to second place in group A.
It means you have to make everything count, she said, with what sounded like a hint of relief that matches now revert to the customary five-game encounters.
Nouran is a feisty player and definitely one for the future, and I am so pleased to come out with a win.
David will complete a hat-trick of World Series finals titles after the womens events three-year hiatus if she triumphs in Saturdays final, something which may feel especially welcome to her after an almost barren 17 months.
First though she must cope tomorrow (Friday) with Raneem El Welily, the former world number one from Egypt against whom she saved a match point to win the memorable 2014 world final in Cairo. Welily finished top of group B, unbeaten with three wins, after beating her friend Omneya Abdel Kawy 15-13, 11-9.
The other semi-final is between Laura Massaro, the top-seeded former world champion from England and Nour El Sherbini, the 20-year-old current world champion from Egypt.
Massaro notched her third win by overcoming Amanda Sobhy, the first American ever to make the worlds top eight,13-11, 11-9 in a tense, tight, and occasionally contentious match with a trickle of difficult refereeing decisions.
Sherbini, by contrast, rescued herself from a first day defeat with a calm and authoritative 11-4, 11-6 success against Camille Serme, last years British Open champion from France. This second victory kept alive her chances of a climactic finish to by far the finest season of her career.
The other world champion, Greg Gaultier, was rewarded for his three wins with a semi-final against Miguel Angel Rodriguez, the dynamic fifth-seeded Colombian. The Frenchman had already been sure of qualifying worked hard and pulled out some extra tricks to prevail 7-11, 11-8, 11-1 against Omar Mosaad, yet another high level Egyptian.
What was effectively a dead match contained surprising drive and tension, emanating from its being a repeat of the World Open final six months ago in Seattle.
Gaultier could go on to a final with the favourite Mohamed Elshorbagy, whose semi-final is against Cameron Pilley, the first Australian since Anthony Ricketts a decade ago to reach the semi-finals.
Pilley beat Simon Rosner, the sixth-seeded German, 11-2, 11-7 and finished second in his group with two wins, attributing his improvement to a couple of changes with technical things and training methods, which have freshened him.
Later Nick Matthew, the three-times world champion, ended speculation that at the age of almost 36 he is about to retire after a decade and at the top level. The Englishman gained a good-looking result in an exhibition-style dead encounter with a 12-10, 12-10 win against the Bristol-based Elshorbagy, afterwards explaining why he hoped still to remain a leading contender.
I aim for a good summers training which Ive not had for a couple of years (because of injuries), Matthew said. And if I do - I believe I have another good season left in me.

LC, ACF condemn appointments of Palpita and Ranawaka
The Left Circle (LC) along with the Anti Corruption Front (ACF) activists strongly deplored the appointment of Anusha Palpita and R.A.A.K. Ranawaka as additional secretaries to ministries by the government.
Former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission Director General Anusha Palpita has been allegedly appointed an additional secretary to the Home Affairs Ministry, when he was facing charges of allegedly misappropriating over Rs. 600 million for the distribution of Sil Redi on the eve of the last Presidential election.
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena on May 26 rejected the so called appointment of former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission Director General Anusha Palpita as an Additional Secretary of the Home Affairs Ministry calling it a media appointment.
But the LC and the ACF pointed out that the appointment had been made with the sole intention of providing a shield for Palpita against the law. They said, through the appointment, the ministry and the minister had not only displayed their shamelessness, but also their disregard for Administrative
and Financial Regulations to rescue the thieves.
We are aware that there is a group operating inside the UNP to protect corrupters and Vajira Abeywardena seems to be the pioneer of the group. It is degrading to witness a responsible minister pretending to be unaware of what is taking place, he said.
They pointed out that there are nearly 2,500 government servants who have faced interdiction due to alleged corruptions, but the same law was not applied on top government officials.
Abeywardena said government appointments are initiated through the Public Service Commission(PSC) and that he had not received any appointment letter pertaining to Palpitas appointment, during a press conference held on May 26.
However, the LC and ACF challenged the minister that they are ready to produce the appointment letter handed over to Palpita.
We wish to inform the minister that we are ready to produce the appointment letter and we also wish to ask the minister whether he is ready to take up the challenge.
We strongly ask the minister to resign from his post with immediate effect, the LC said.
Putting an end to bribery and corruption and punishing those engaged in serious financial crimes during the previous regime, were the top election promises of the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) government.
The civil society that ensured the UNFGG victory, was keen on implementing a proper mechanism to prevent corruption as an election victory and a change of regime were not adequate to end the culture of corruption in Sri Lanka.
However, the present government has appointed several people to top government positions, including some cabinet ministers who were also accused of financial corruptions during the previous regime.
This would only result in the public turning against the government, Ulapane Sumangala Thero said.

Outstanding catching compensates for innocuous bowling
DURHAM: Brilliant Sri Lankan catching in cold conditions was the feature of the first day of the second Test at Chester-le-Street here on Friday where England winning the toss and batting first finished on 310 for six wickets.
Of the six wickets Sri Lanka took during the day four were due to outstanding catches.
Skipper Angelo Mathews blinder of a catch at slip to send back Alex Hales for 83 was the top of the lot. The England opener offered a full blooded cut off left-arm spinner Milinda Siriwardana and as the ball flew off the edge Mathews dived to his right and held the ball one-handed.
Sri Lankas brilliant catching compensated for the Lankan bowling which was too friendly on the slow pitch where the odd ball kept low.
Dimuth Karunaratne picked up a fine catch at slip to send back Alastair Cook for 15, denying the England captain his milestone of becoming the first Englishman to reach 10,000 Test runs. Cook started the day requiring 20 to reach the landmark but fell short by five when he was dismissed for 15.
Unless Sri Lanka put up a good first innings total, and make England to bat again in the second innings Cook may well have to wait until the start of the third and final Test at Lords on June 9 to get to the milestone. At Leeds, England batted only once and won the Test by an innings to go one-up in the three match series. Suranga Lakmal who replaced the injured Dushmantha Chameera pulled off a stunning catch at deep square leg when Nick Compton offered a full blooded pull with his score on nine.
The fourth catch of the day was held by Lahiru Thirimanne at short cover when James Vince drove at Siriwardana and the fielder diving to his right pulled off a ripper.
Sri Lankan bowling in these conditions looked harmless but their persistency paid rich dividends as they managed to prize out six England wickets.
Joe Root was the other England batsman to miss out on a hundred when he popped up a simple catch to Kaushal Silva at cover with his score on 80.
Hales and Root added 96 and Root also shared another half century stand with Vince. But each time England looked like running away with the game Sri Lanka managed to pull back and pluck a wicket.
Nuwan Pradeep was the pick of the Lankan bowlers finishing with three wickets for 69 including that of Jonny Bairstow the man of the match at Leeds with a career best 140. Bairstow fell to the second new ball attempting to slash at Pradeep and giving Dinesh Chandimal a straight forward catch after scoring 48 off 57 balls.
With Moeen Ali who was unbeaten on 28 at the close, Bairstow added 70 for the sixth wicket. Chris Woakes who replaced the injured Ben Stokes was not out eight.
Like Cook, left-arm spinner Rangana Herath was also left seeking his 300th Test wicket. Herath created some problems for the batsmen with his guile and flight but England managed to overcame it and deprive him of the milestone. Herath is shy of one wicket from becoming the third Sri Lankan bowler to get to the mark.
Siriwardana considered to be the man with the golden arm justified his selection ahead of Dasun Shanaka with two wickets  both to excellent catches by Mathews and Thirimanne.
In the gloomy morning it looked as if Sri Lanka had got it all wrong when they left out Shanaka for the left-arm spin of Siriwardana, but later as the day progressed and the wicket started to get slow and keep low it seemed a good choice.
It seems the Lankans whose fielding had dropped drastically in recent times have worked hard in this area and the results are showing on the field.
The overcast skies gave away to bright sunshine during the final session of play. The forecast for the next two days is for good weather.

Manchester United name Mourinho as new manager
MANCHESTER, FRIDAY: Manchester United on Friday officially named Jose Mourinho as their new manager in place of the sacked Louis van Gaal.
The club said in a statement that the 53-year-old Portuguese coach had signed a three year contract with an option to stay until at least 2020.
To become Manchester United manager is a special honour in the game, Mourinho said. It is a club known and admired throughout the world. There is a mystique and a romance about it which no other club can match.
I have always felt an affinity with Old Trafford; it has hosted some important memories for me in my career and I have always enjoyed a rapport with the United fans. Im looking forward to being their manager and enjoying their magnificent support in the coming years.
Media reports said Mourinho will earn up to 15 million pounds ($21 million/19.6 million euros) a year and will have a 200 million pound fund to buy players for United who failed to qualify for the Champions League with their fifth place finish in the Premier League. Jose is quite simply the best manager in the game today, said Uniteds executive vice chairman Ed Woodward.
He has won trophies and inspired players in countries across Europe and, of course, he knows the Premier League very well, having won three titles here. AFP

Zimbabwes Streak quits Bangladesh
DHAKA, FRIDAY: Former Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak said he will quit as Bangladeshs fast bowling coach at the end of the month after deciding not to renew his contract.
The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said Streak, who has been linked with a coaching post at Indias national academy, informed them of his decision via email.
