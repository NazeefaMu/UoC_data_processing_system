Spider Boy breaks world contortion record
A 13-year-old Palestinian boy has twisted his way into the record books. Mohammed Alsheikh of Gaza broke the world record for most full body revolutions maintaining a chest stand in one minute, according to Guinness World Records.
Alsheikh, aka Spider Boy, managed to run around his seemingly elastic body 38 times during his record attempt in Amman, Jordan.
This is one time where a GIF really is worth a thousand words. Alsheikh smashed the previous record of 29, set earlier this month by circus performer Leilani Franco. Hopefully, Franco wont get bent out of shape - Wait! Thats her job. She still holds a world record for the fastest time to travel 20 meters in a contortion roll (17.47 seconds) and the fastest human backbend walk (20 meters in 10.05 seconds).
Alsheikh is proud to have the record but still looks to Franco as an inspiration.
Im very excited that I have achieved a Guinness World Records title and I managed to exceed the previous record holder who was a lot older than me, he told Guinness.

[APPRECIATIONS - (27-02-2017)]
Albert Clarence Fernando
Live wire of Moratuwa St. Sebastians
It's 20 years since Albert Clarence Fernando entered eternal glory to be with his maker. February 11, 2017 was his 20th death anniversary. He was the chief of the clerical staff of St. Sebastian's College, Moratuwa, which was also my alma mater.
He was a very loyal old boy of the college, a very active member of the college OBA, as well as a live wire of the college Teachers Guide for many years. During his period of tenure, he served the college administration without any fear or favour.
Albert was the energetic Treasurer of the OBA for over 15 years continuously, Vice President of the OBA, President and Treasurer of the Teachers Guild, member of the Welfare Society during very difficult days of the college, and also served in almost all committees in various capacities, holding responsible positions in serving his alma mater. In all projects organized by the OBA to raise funds for the college, he was the one and only person who was entrusted with the responsibility of handling large sums of money collected from the public. I well remember that at the several carnivals organized to raise funds, he was there in the office till the early hours of the morning. In whatever capacity he worked, he gave his very best in performing his duties.
Albert, who was always smartly dressed in immaculate white, was also one of the members of the college staff. At the same time, he was one of the earliest to arrive and commence work for the day, patiently and silently.
Likewise, he was the last to return home after work, often after 5 pm. His integrity and dedication to work entrusted to him was unique.
He never looked for positions or other perks, but discharged his duties without leaving any loopholes, for the betterment of the college. He gave his whole-hearted co-operation to all the Rev. Directors under whom he worked.
Albert Fernando was one who always stood by the La Sallian Brothers. My association with him began from my school days, and I would say very proudly that he never uttered a word to hurt the feelings of others and was extremely courteous and kind to all those who came to seek his assistance.
May his soul rest in peace in the presence of his maker!

Dr. Quintus Corea
Treasured doctor
Quintus Corea was born to Edith and Dominic Corea on the September 26, 1925. As his name implies, he was the fifth in a family of sixfive boys and a girl.
Being of a service-oriented disposition, he decided to study medicine. Having qualified as a doctor, he married Margie Alles in 1959 and had two childrenChris and Rochelle. Quintus and Margie celebrated over 50 years of marriage until Margie passed away in 2010.
Although he had only two children and four grandchildren, many in his extended family and in the community looked up to him as a father-figure. So much that he served as the Patron of the Colombo Chetty Community in Sri Lanka for many years until his death.
He was a source of great comfort when it came to medical matters and all sorts of other matters. Many confided in him, secure in the knowledge that their secrets were very safe in his confidence.
As a doctor, he was an exponent of the healing art. He treated not only the bodies but also the minds and hearts of his patients. This made him very much in demand in the social circle. When someone was ill, the first question would be Has Quintus seen him yet. Many patients would say Quintus came and now I feel much better. His bedside manner and diagnostic skills were legendary, and he epitomized the concept that the practice of medicine was not just a science, but also an art.
Many visited our home to seek his advice and he would also visit family members, friends, and neighbors at all hours of the day or night to sort out medical problems.
His earnings came only from his meager salary as a Government and Local Government doctor. Although he did not earn anything else from the practice of medicine he acquired immeasurable goodwill in the community in return for his selfless service.
His passion for pets was also legendary. He had all manner of bird and beast as pets, including deer, sambur, donkeys, ponies, porcupines, rock squirrels, and his favourite which survives himhis African grey parrot Chico. This passion for pets was prevalent amongst all his brothers and periodically there was much excitement in the family when one of them had a new addition to their menagerie.
He loved the outdoors and took great pleasure in visiting his coconut estate where he would show us some large and prolific fruit trees and proudly sayall these trees were planted by me. The estate was also invaluable in housing the larger members of his menagerie.
Tennis was another passion. He would be out on the tennis court at the Otters almost every day with his many friendssome of whom are present here today. This was usually followed by a quick beer. He continued playing tennis until Margies passing in 2010a period of over 60 years. Although he tried to get back into the game again, this was not to be as age had taken its toll.
Afterwards, his source of entertainment was playing cards with Margies sisters and their friends. I am sure that the presence of her sisters reminded him of her, and he enjoyed their company immensely.
It is very hard for us to manage without his constant, caring, steadfast presence.
I used to visit him in his room in the evenings and share a drink with him. He was a man of few words, and although we enjoyed much fellowship and exchange of news most of this took place with a minimum of actual conversation. This interaction had a therapeutic effect on both of us and I will be facing the vacuum created by his absence for the rest of my days. Although he was absolutely alert mentally, I realized that at 91, I would not have the privilege of his company, love, and guidance forever. So, I tried to make the most of it at the time.
A few days before he passed away, he must have had some premonition because he asked me to stay with him while the rest of the family went on a small trip.
I should have guessed that there was something significant in this as he is usually undemanding to a fault. His medical skills may have led him to realize that his own life was nearing its end. His heart which had beaten for him and for his vast extended family for 91 years was reaching the end of its life. Even the strongest oak must ultimately fall.
Always a meticulously religious person, he would attend mass dutifully on Sundays. When he became less mobile, he witnessed mass on TV conducted in Latin.
He greatly appreciated the Latin mass as it brought back to him memories of his childhood. A few days before he passed away, Rev. Sr. Barbara who is known to the family for over 50 years, administered holy communion to him whilst he enthusiastically uttered the appropriate responses in Latin. We entrust Daddy to the caring hands of his creator and thank God for giving him to us for so long.
He joined the company of Mummy once again, and this may account for the flicker of a smile that lit up his face in the end. Our Father, who art now in heaven Hallowed be thy name.

William Henry Samaranayake
A great educationist
The passing of William Henry Samaranayake, retired principal of St. Bernadettes College, Polgahawela, in 1969, removed a great educationist and social worker of this country.
His activities were directed to the welfare of students, many of whom rose to power and distinction. When he took over St. Bernadettes College, it had but two cadjan huts to house its students. Through his perseverance, the college grew in land and magnificent buildings.
He was calm and collected, and a gentleman par excellence; he belonged to an age fast-sliding into history. He successfully accomplished tasks, reaching eminence in diverse fields.
His philanthropic genius enabled many unfortunates to bask in the sunshine of his warm hearted munificence and generous acts. Educationists of Samaranayakes stamp, mettle, and genius are rare as sandalwood trees which adorn the jungles of Sri Lanka.
He will long be remembered as the great educationist who disciplined and moulded the characters of the students to be respectful towards parents, elders, and the state. Those students who now occupy occupations of dignity owe a great deal to Samaranayake.
He was also a prolific writer to the press, and his articles were directed towards creating public opinion. Three great ambitions are to be the ruler of a city, the principal of a great school, or the author of a great book. He was not only the principal of that great school, St. Bernadettes College, but also the author of four great books: English with a Smile 1, 2, 3, and Practical English, which is almost a vade mecum and a sine qua non of students of English in Sri Lanka.
Although he has gone to eternal rest, he will live on forever in his books, which as textbooks in Sri Lankan schools, have proved, and will prove to be, invaluable guides to generations of teachers and students for years. The world lost a great educationist who was distinguished for his simplicity, integrity, and sense of duty.
His 47th death anniversary fell on August 26, 2016, and his 110th birth anniversary fell on November 26, 2016.
We hold you close within
Our hearts and there you
Will remain to walk
With us throughout
Our lives until we meet
On that beautiful shore

Rev Bro Michael Robert
Another legend lost
It is five years since Rev Bro Michael Robert entered eternal glory to be with his maker. March 8 will be his fifth death anniversary. He was my class teacher at St Sebastians College in Moratuwa which is my alma mater. Bro Michael Robert was born on February 23, 1936 and his parents were late Bastian Santiago and late Magilin Fernando. He was admitted to the juniorate from St Marys College, Chilaw in 1949 and received the Holy Habit in Penang on June 24, 1952.
He taught and worked at St Sebastians College, Moratuwa, De Mazenod College, Kandana, St Benedicts College, Kotahena and St Marys College, Chilaw. He served in different communities and held different positions as teacher, assistant Prefect of Games, Book Depot Manager, APC in-charge, class teacher, boarding prefect formator, assistant director, supervisor, vice principal and acting principal.
He was the former Director of the De Mezenod community and was in charge of the district archives. He was 76 years and had served for 60 years as a De La Selle Brother at the time of his death.
Many were the God-given qualities in his life. Looking back, in short, I could say that he was a man of prayer, a kind and a cheerful person and an authentic religious person.
Rev Bro Michael Robert was a voracious reader, an educationist, a historian, a good teacher, a leader and a strict disciplinarian. He was an example of discipline, regularity, and orderliness. He was a knowledgeable, experienced and wise person. He was a historian with a good memory and could relate to any person on any topic in a positive and inspiring way. He was courageous and hard-working, and had a preserving character.
In fact, he published some valuable books during his period of retirement. The three-volume History of the De La Salle Brothers in Sri Lanka, Deceased Brothers of the District of Colombo, Community Prayer Service  La Saccean Saints, Praying  the Rule and 75 Reflections are some of his publications. He shared his spiritual wealth where he experienced God in his life, with us. He was an evangelizer of the young and made them feel that they are loved and cared for, by making them at home.
Even during the time he was ailing, he made it a point to thank and appreciate all those who visited him.
With his passing away, the De La Salle brothers in Sri Lanka lost another legend, a devoted brother. We thank Rev Bro Michael for the inspiring leadership he gave us wherever he worked in the formation of houses, schools and religious communities. We thank him very much for touching our hearts.
May He Rest in Peace

Daisy David
Unforgettable teacher
It is with great grief, I pay this tribute to my beloved sister, Daisy. She was born on October 29, 1924 and was called to her eternal rest on February 28, 1983. At the time of her demise, she was teaching at Dematagoda M.V. She took a keen interest in teaching English and carried out all the duties trusted to her.
She was a member of St. Peters Church, Mutwal. She took part in all church activities, and enjoyed herself. Birthdays were always looked forward to by her relatives and friends. She would prepare many dishes. Her nieces and nephews were well cared for by her.
She was the one who looked after me, my sister, Ruby; and my brother, David. She made many sacrifices for the family.
She was kind, loving, and generous. She was very smartly dressed, and had a charming smile.
Life was not always easy for her, but she took on challenges with great courage and fortitude, and she had unfailing faith in the Lord. I miss her guidance and assistance and Im comforted by the though that she is at peace in the presence of Lord Jesus Christ.
Asleep in Gods beautiful garden,
Away from pain.
Some day when our lifes journey ends,
We shall be together again.

Lucian Emmanuel Fernando
Excellent Administrative Officer
It is with sadness that I write these few lines on Lucian Emmanuel Fernando who was an Assistant Regional Manager of the Peoples Bank from 1953 to 1983, and father of my good friend Terrence.
Born on January 7, 1929, Lucian Emmanuel passed away peacefully on February 26, 2003 at the age of 74 years. He hailed from a very respectable Catholic family of Katukurunda, Moratuwa, and had his entire education in one of the leading Catholic schools, namely, St Sebastians College, Moratuwa.
After completing his studies as a dedicated and brilliant student, Lucian brought immense credit to his school in the spheres of sports and other extra-curricular activities. He excelled as an all-round sportsman, representing the college in cricket and athletics during his time. He found employment firstly at the Bank of Ceylon, where he worked as a clerk for five years, and subsequently, at the Peoples Bank, in the same capacity.
He served the bank for 30 years continuously until he retired from the banking service. At the time of relinquishing office, he had been elevated to the post of Assistant Regional Manager. He thereafter joined the private sector, as Director of Zellers Holdings and Alpex Engineering Ltd in Colombo. He was a very efficient and highly intelligent Administrative Officer, and also a kind-hearted person.
He was a faithful husband to his wife, Felicia, a loving and caring father to his nine children, and an adoring grandfather to his grandchildren. Felicias father, who was from Beruwala, was a very close relative of mine. However, after Felicias aunts death, we lost close contact with that family.
My association with his five sons, Laktran, Anton, Terrence, Linzy, and Sharvan began in early 1972 while at St Sebastians College, Moratuwa, when I was in grade seven. Laktran represented the Sebastians invincible 1971 and 1972 cricket team led by the legendary Sunil Wickramanayake. Another of Lucians sons, my best friend Terrence, worked for a short period at the Food and Beverages Department of a leading hotel in Colombo and Galle in 1978. During his last days, Lucian lived with his son, Terrence.
Lucian Fernando was the eldest in a family of three, the others being Norbert and Bernadette. His brother, Norbert, was a former all-round cricketer who played for St Sebastians, Catamarans Sports Club, Air Force, and Ceylon Intercontinental (now Kingsbury) during a span of 22 years.
Norberts wife Norma, was a retired teacher of St Sebastians College, Moratuwa. She was my tutor in the primary section. Her father, Lawrence Sir, also served as an English Master in the same school.
All family members are past pupils of my alma mater, St Sebastians College, Moratuwa. Lucian and my father, Mervyn, were more friends than relations. He left behind three daughters and six sons. I have seen from my young days that annually, all members of Lucians family get-together and offer prayers soon after the St Sebastians Church feast. This proves the unity of their family.
Lucian had many friends, and one of them was the auxiliary Bishop of Colombo, Dr Marius Peiris, also a past pupil of St Sebastians College, Moratuwa. I extend my deepest sympathies to the bereaved family.
May the soul of Lucian Fernando Rest in Peace and rise in glory!

Rev. Bro. Stephen Modestus
First old boy Director of St. Sebastians
It is with profound sorrow that I write this appreciation of Rev. Bro. Modestus FSC who passed away peacefully on February 7, 2003. Bro. Modestus was the first old boy Director of St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa which was my alma mater, and in addition, he became a Director of St. Benedicts College, Kotahena as well. Bro. Modestus served for a long period at his alma mater, St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa.
He hailed from Katukurunda in Moratuwa and was the son of Joseph Peiris and Inez Bastiana Fernando. He was the second Moratuwite to join the La Sallian Institute, the first being Rev. Bro. Cassim Charles. He joined the juniorate in September 1930 and after a brief period there, went to the novitiate in Penang.
In August, 1932, Bro. Stephen entered the scholasticate at Mutwal and took his vows as a Christian Brother. In January, 1934, he joined De Mazenod College, Kandana, as a teacher, and at the end of the year, he joined St. Marys School in the Pettah. In 1939, he was transferred to the De La Salle school to be in charge of the Kindergarten Department and was involved in various activities relating to the primary school.
He took over the St. Benedicts College branch at Veyangoda as Principal and was also in charge of its boarding house. In 1945, he was re-transferred to St. Benedicts College, Kotahena, as the Prefect of boarders and the junior classes.
From 1947 to 1954 he served as the Principal of the primary school, Prefect of boarders, and Prefect of Games at De Mazenod College. Subsequently, he was appointed the Principal of St. Andrews College, Puttalam.
In 1956, he came back to St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa, as the Principal of the Primary Department and Sub-Director of the College. In 1959, he became the Director, and thereby created history of a past pupil becoming a director of the school for the first time. Due to his efforts, the number of students on the roll rose to 1500 with 99% being Catholics. It was he who formed the scout troop which brought many a glory to the school.
During this period, Bro. Modestus winning ways earned himself the invaluable assistance from the then Parish Priest of Moratuwa, Rt. Rev. Dr. Edmund Fernando, the Bishop of Badulla. He found many ways to raise funds for the college.
In 1964, he went back to St. Benedicts College as Head of the Primary Department and Prefect of boarders and ultimately became the acting Director.
In 1977, he went into retirement yet in 1978, returned to St. Sebastians College. The government too recognized the services of Bro. Stephen Modestus in the sphere of education and appointed him an All-Island Justice of Peace.
May his soul Rest in Peace. PP
C.G.Weeramantry
Luminary judge
C.G. Weeramantry was a lawyer, Supreme Court Judge, lecturer, legal consultant, and served in high office in local and international legal and academic fields. He wrote many books on important legal and religious aspects, and key topics reflecting on our societys past, present, and future.
Ive observed his great vision, looking at his publications and speeches delivered.
He will remain in the hearts of all whove loved him as a religious-minded, soft-spoken, simple person. Im very happy and fortunate to have met and worked with him during my life, and I believe that it was a God-given privilege.
Ive gained knowledge and important guidelines for my personal life from him.
First and foremost, my thanks goes to Dr. Rohan Perera (PC), Former Chief Legal Advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Colombo, and the present Sri Lanka permanent representative to the UN, who recommended me to serve late Justice Weeramantrys office.
I had heard the name of Justice C.G. Weeramantry while I was working as a staff member at the Law Chambers (Law library) at Hultsdorf, Colombo, and was blessed to meet and work with him many years later (more than 30 years later). I had opportunities to handle numerous valuable publications and preparations for his visits abroad on invitations received from internationally recognized academic and other organizations for orations, seminars, and workshops.
It was nice to see and read the values involved with his speeches and lectures, mostly on climate change and its effects on the world, multi-religious values, and inter-faith dialogues. Justice Weeramantry also paid a memorable visit to Theological College, Pilimatalawa, as Chief Guest for their Annual College Day, and graduation ceremony held in 2011 on an invitation from the Principal of the college. He made a fruitful speech for the graduating students.
I was happy thinking how Judge Weeramanatry was so simple although he had been a highly-recognized personality in Sri Lanka and abroad.
Madam Weeramantry was a kind-hearted lady who always supported his work as a shadow partner. Although we may not able to hear Justice Weeramantrys voice, his name, publications, and speeches keep us alive and remind us his valuable academic life offered to all of us in Sri Lanka an abroad.
Considering his spiritual vision, one of the latest publication of his Our LadyA Fount of Inspiration has been recognized by the general public and the Catholic Church of Sri Lanka.
Lord Jesus has called him to rest in peace from his faithful and confident life as we mourn his passing.

ATG Ceylon celebrates  25 years in Sri Lanka
ATG Ceylon (Pvt) Limited of the ATG Group, celebrates its silverjubileeon 27thFebruary this year. The Company was founded in 1992 by 3 visionaries, Sri Lankan born Fazal Abdeen along with British nationals John Taylor and the late Howard Goth, who saw great potential in their investment.
To date the Group has created over 5,000 job opportunities for Sri Lankans through their various subsidiaries which they plan to increase to 7,500 by 2020. ATG plans on maintaining this momentum by further developing their technology, engineering and human resources in order to equip themselves to face all future challenges. ATG whose offices and factories are based in Katunayake, Wathupitiwala and Koggala export promotion zones has now expanded their operations with 5 factories under their name. They have become a strong global player exporting their products to over 35 countries.
Earlier known as John Ward Ceylon (Pvt) Limited, they started out as a small PVC glove manufacturing plant located in the Katunayake Free Trade Zone,manufacturing their first glove brands Vysol, Vysol Plus, Vygen and Vygen Plus. They went on to establish a Nitrileglove plantin 1993.
2009 marked a significant change for this Sri Lankan, British partnership when they rebranded the Company as ATG which stands for Advanced Technology Gloves. Incidentally, ATG is also a combination of the first initials of the 3 partners surnames.The rebranding spelt positive change for the company as their focus changed to expanding their global presence as well as their local operations.
The Companys success in the global market can be attributed to the value they place on innovation and quality. They design and manufacture to enhance the performance of the most sophisticated work tool - the hand; and delivers quality products and services, through core teams who regularly track markets, observes products in use and has discussions with end-users, forming the basis to continually improve the needs of varied customer segments.
Their Factories are outfitted withfully automated plantsand employed with highly skilled staff who produce a world class product manufactured to the highest international standards.ATG Gloves Knitting (Pvt) Ltd., established in the Wathupitiwala Export Promotion Zonein 2007 was another major step by the Group. ATGs Managing Director, Fazal Abdeen says that the Company does not outsource anything, We are now a fully integrated manufacturer and can control all elements within our manufacturing facilities. From the covering and twisting of yarns to knitting glove liners, coating, finishing and packing, we have the facility to do it all.
He says that apart from enabling them to deliver high-quality gloves, the fully integrated approach assists the company in transitioning products from their state of the art Research &Development laboratories to full production. Unlike other R&D departments, ATG facilities focus on developing technology platforms as opposed to one-off individual gloves.

Backhoe operator crushed to death
A backhoe machine operator was crushed to death and three other workers were injured when a heavy mound of earth with rock boulders collapsed on a group of workers engaged in construction work connected with the Kalu Ganga reservoir project in the Laggala area around 9 am yesterday.This project is handled by a Chinese company.
The large mound of earth had collapsed because it had got loosened due to rock blasting work done on the hillock above the previous day.
Another worker who was repairing a backhoe machine after creeping under it had also got caught in the landslide and it had been difficult to extricate him since the entire backhoe machine is covered by debris including rock parts. The trapped employee had given a call from his mobile phone to fellow workers at the site requesting them to rescue him. The people engaged in rescue operations had bored a hole through the debris to the place he is trapped to pump oxygen for his survival until he is taken out. Two others engaged in loading earth to a truck who were injured have been hospitalized.
The Army and Police STF personnel are engaged in the operation to rescue the trapped worker.

Bangladeshs Rahim relishes chances against Sri Lanka
Dhaka: Bangladesh Test captain Mushfiqur Rahim believes his team has "a good chance" of an upset victory against Sri Lanka given the island nation's current dearth of heavyweight players.
A 16-member squad will leave Monday to play two Tests against the Sri Lankans -- one in Galle on March 7-11 and another in Colombo, which starts on March 15 and will be Bangladesh's 100th Test.
The teams are also scheduled to play three 50-over One-Day Internationals (ODIs) before facing off for two Twenty20 Internationals at the tail-end of the tour, which wraps up on April 6.
Sri Lanka have a good record at home, beating Australia 3-0 in the last series they hosted in August 2016. But the team will be without some of its star players during the Bangladesh tour following the retirements of Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Tillakaratne Dilshan and Muttiah Muralitharan.
Sangakkara, Jayawardene and Dilshan are the only players to have scored more than 1,000 Test runs against Bangladesh while off-spinner Muralitharan claimed 89 wickets in 11 Tests.
They (Sri Lanka) are going to miss some players who have been part of their team for many days. Regular captain Angelo Mathews is also absent," Rahim said in Dhaka ahead of the team's departure.
Skipper Angelo Mathews was Saturday ruled out of the Tests, even as selectors said they were preparing to field a "formidable team". The Sri Lankan cricket board did not say why Mathews was dropped, but he returned home last month halfway through the South African tour after twisting his ankle.
Rahim also pointed to his side's bowling variety.
We have three different types of bowlers in Shakib (Al Hasan), Mustafiz (Mustafizur Rahman) and Miraj (Mehedi Hasan). When they bowl together it would create pressure on any opponent," he said.
He added that Bangladesh's recent performance in Tests would also help.
They will remain under a little pressure because they know Bangladesh are also playing well for a long period. Considering all these factors, I would say we have a good chance, he said.
Bangladesh drew their Test series against England in October at home. Although they lost their last two series in New Zealand and India, the Tigers were able to stretch the matches to the fifth day.
Everything will actually depend on how we can give our best. If we can give our best, I am sure the result will come to our favour, Rahim said.
I think in Test, one-day international or Twenty20 international -- whatever the format is -- people now expect us to win," he added.
Bangladesh have played 16 Tests against Sri Lanka, the highest for the Test minnows against any opponent. But they could manage only two draws against the islanders in their previous two series. AFP

BASL Secretary Amal Randeniya told the Daily News yesterday that it has been revealed that the appointment was made subsequent to a letter written by BASL President Geoffrey Alagaratnam. However, the Executive Committee members as well as Bar Council members were unaware of this letter. It came up during the Executive Committee meeting on Saturday that this letter was sent by the BASL President without the consent of the Bar Council or Executive Committee. This is an internal issue that we must first be resolved. It was pointed out at the meeting that the BASL President had violated the BASL Constitution by sending the recommendation letter without the approval of the Bar Council or Executive Committee he said.
We would write to the JSC explaining the entire episode surrounding the controversial appointment he said.
It has also been decided to hold the BASL election on March 15 after amending its Constitution.

Bayern destroy Hamburg 8-0 with Lewandowski hat-trick
MUNICH, Saturday -Bayern Munich forward Robert Lewandowski scored a hat-trick as the Bundesliga leaders mercilessly obliterated Hamburg SV 8-0 on Saturday as coach Carlo Ancelotti celebrated his 1,000th game as manager.
The win kept Bayern five points clear at the top as they again inflicted on their opponents their heaviest league defeat.
The Pole, who has netted 19 times in the Bundesliga this season, struck twice in the first half and slotted in his third goal in the 54th minute after Arturo Vidal had put the hosts ahead in the 17th.
Strugglers Hamburg had been confident they would not be the punch bags of past matches between the sides, having also lost 8-0 in Munich two years ago, and they had been unbeaten in their last three games.
But they looked shell-shocked as they conceded another goal by David Alaba in the 56th and substitute Kingsley Coman scored twice more within five minutes a little later.
Arjen Robben struck on the break as Hamburg again capitulated to the Bundesliga champions and current leaders.
A perfect day, a perfect game, said Ancelotti. The team played an outstanding game and I could not be happier.
I told my players before the game that I wanted a good match for my anniversary. I never thought it would be that good. I hope we show the same attitude in our next game.
Bayern never gave Hamburg a chance, making amends for their last-gasp 1-1 draw at Hertha Berlin last week.
They had 75 percent possession in the first half alone and could have added to their tally with Lewandowski also hitting the woodwork.
I think we did not win a single one-on-one throughout the entire first half, Hamburg keeper Rene Adler said. It's just intolerable.
Second-placed RB Leipzig stayed five points off the pace after beating Cologne 3-1 to climb up to 48 points.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ended his goal drought after 471 minutes to score twice as Borussia Dortmund tightened their hold on third place with a 3-0 victory at Freiburg.
Dortmund are on 40 points, three ahead of Hoffenheim who play Schalke 04 on Sunday.
Hertha Berlin beat 10-man Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0 with goals from Vedad Ibisevic and Vladimir Darida in the second half to leapfrog their opponents into fifth place.
Eintracht, two points behind in sixth, had Haris Seferovic sent off for elbowing an opponent.  Agencies

Behind One of the Most Famous Faces in Art Laurie Lico Albanese
I write historical fiction based on the lives of real people and put women at the center of those stories. These are women who have been marginalized by history or whose triumphs and tragedies have been forgotten by todays readers. In my work, Im inspired as much by Lily King and Paula McClain as by Nathaniel Hawthorne and William Shakespeare, who also wrote fiction based on history and the people who lived it.
My new novel Stolen Beauty gives voice to one of the most recognized women in art: Adele Bloch-Bauer. Like Helen, the face that launched a thousand ships, Adeles beauty is associated with war, love, and envy. The story encompasses the height of Jewish Vienna, the depths of Hitlers depravity, the beginning of modern Expressionism, the struggle of an elderly woman to reclaim her rightful legacy, and a 2004 US Supreme Court case that made headlines on both sides of the Atlantic. Adeles taleinterwoven with that of her niece Mariais as much about creativity and self-discovery as it is about the search for identity and the preservation of a history that might otherwise have been destroyed, forgotten, and lost.
Adele Bloch-Bauer was a wealthy Jewish patron of the arts in turn-of-the-century Viennaand the only woman to have her portrait painted twice by Klimt. Like other feminist heroines featured in historical fiction, Adele was a brilliant young woman who struggled against the limitations put upon her by societal restrictions and gender roles.
Thwarted in her desire to attend university, she married young and became a salon leader, muse, and eventually, a socialist activist. Imagining her private struggles gave me ample opportunity to wonder what I would have done had I been born in similar times, faced with similar challenges.
My great-grandmother, in fact, was. Creative, energetic and self-determined, Regina was born seven years after Adele, under the same emperor: Adele in Vienna in 1881, Regina in Budapest in 1888.
Regina was a small woman, but she was fierce and never at rest. Shes smart as a whip, my mother told me when I was a girl. Nothing gets by her, nobody takes advantage of her.
When I was young, I understood this to be a product of Reginas refugee status and her immigrant background. I understood that the qualities of intelligence, industriousness, and financial intelligence were Reginas defining characteristics.
Adele was the spirited daughter of a banker who had been honored by Emperor Franz Josef, the monarch who led the Hapsburg Empire for more than 50 years. Regina was the spirited daughter of jewelers who served the Hapsburgs royal city in Hungary. Her brothers, also jewelers, brought her to America around 1904, about the same time that Adele was getting to know Gustav Klimt as a friend, muse, and, most likely, as a lover.
Reginas brothers made her a nanny to their children. They told her to change her name to Alice, presumably to Americanize her. They assumed she would obey the men in her family, marry within her religion, repress her personal desires, and stay in her place. Adeles father expected her to marry and take her rightful place as a daughter, wife, and mother in his distinguished lineage. Adele did not cooperate. Neither did Regina.
With her pale red hair and bright blue eyes, Regina walked proudly through her Long Island sea town, where the Italian barber who would become her husband spotted her. My great grandfather, Genarro, was short, handsome, and Catholic. He watched her walk by his family barbershop and was smitten.
Reginas Hungarian Jewish family disowned her when the young couple married. She set up her own home and seamstress business, planted a garden, and started a family. Although my great-grandparents were poor, somehow Regina had her portrait painted as a young woman dressed in a corseted, dark blue jacket.
I spent my childhood looking at Reginas portrait hanging over her living room couch, just as Maria Altmann must have spent her childhood looking at the portrait of her wealthy aunt Adele.

More than 5,700 children received gifts of stationery, other school requisites and a school bag each for the new school year under a new employee welfare initiative launched by Brandix, Sri Lankas top ranked exporter.
The Ran Daru Thilina programme benefitted children from the nursery age to grade 5, with each child receiving a pack containing items needed for his or her academic year.
A recipient of stationery and a school bag under the Brandix Ran Daru Thilina initiative with the HR Manager of a Brandix factory.
The generous gesture encompassed the children of 4,969 Brandix associates employed at 24 manufacturing locations in Sri Lanka.
Brandix also has a scholarship scheme titled Ran Daru Scholarships under which financial assistance is extended to Grade 5 children of associates.
Our associates are the life blood of the enterprise, and the well-being of their families is a fundamental consideration in all employee-related engagements at Brandix, said Anusha Alles, Head of CSR and Corporate Communications of the Brandix Group.
The cost of buying stationery and other supplies for school-going children can be a burden on many families. We are happy to be able to help alleviate that burden for a significant number.
Among the items in each pack were exercise books, drawing books, colouring pencils, standard pencils, pencil sharpeners, erasers, bottles of glue and rulers. The packs of younger children also included modelling clay, scissors and crayons.
The beneficiary families are scattered across the country, in areas as far flung as Batticaloa, Giritale, Polonnaruwa, Nivithigala, Koggala, Rambukkana, Kahawatte and Pannala to name a few.
A similar programme has also been implemented by Brandix Apparel India, which is located within the Brandix India Apparel City in Andhra Pradesh.

It was constructed by the government at a cost of about Rs. 50 million several months ago.
The villagers of Dombepola, the Florence Colony and Hathlaha say that the new bridge replacing the old suspension bridge was constructed by the government but they are inconvenienced due to the lack of an access road.

Brighton back on top after Newcastle slip up
LONDON, Saturday - Brighton and Hove Albion eased back to the top of the Championship on Saturday after their 3-0 victory over Reading took them back ahead in their season-long, see-saw battle with Newcastle United at the summit of England's second-tier league.
After Newcastle had been held to a surprise 2-2 draw at home by Bristol City, Brighton cashed in on the slip-up with goals from Sam Baldock, Jamie Murphy and Anthony Knockaert to earn a decisive win over fellow promotion chasers Reading.
Newcastle had appeared to be on course for a shock defeat at their St James Park fortress when struggling Bristol City went two up in just 21 minutes, 37-year-old Aaron Wilbraham heading home and then David Cotterill cashing in on sloppy defending.
Yet Korey Smith's own goal just before the hour and Ciaran Clark's close-range header, his third goal of the season, with eight minutes left, enabled the Magpies to stretch their unbeaten league run to seven matches. It extended their lead to two points before Chris Hughton's Brighton won the late game to move up to 71 points - one clear of Rafa Benitez's men - and set up perfectly Tuesday's eagerly-awaited clash between the top two at the Seagulls Amex Stadium.
Brighton's win also saw them move six points clear of third-placed Huddersfield Town, who were held 1-1 at Barnsley and deprived of a seventh straight league win largely by brilliant goalkeeping from the home side's Adam Davies.
In the day's early match at Elland Road, Chris Wood's 23rd goal of the season in all competitions sealed a 1-0 win for Leeds United over Yorkshire promotion rivals Sheffield Wednesday. As crucial for Leeds as Wood's goal, which made him joint-top scorer in the Championship with Newcastle's Dwight Gayle, was Robert Green's second-half penalty save from Jordan Rhodes as Leeds moved ahead of Reading into fourth place.

IMF Managing Director Lagarde is expected in the country early March and the Sri Lankan Government will present her a proposal for economic development. The Cabinet reshuffle will take place after her visit, sources said.
Meanwhile, Finance Ministry Secretary Dr R H S Samaratunga told the Daily News yesterday that Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake along with senior officials of the Treasury held a discussion with the visiting IMF delegation on Friday. The IMF facilitated an Extended Fund Facility of USD 1.5 billion for Sri Lanka mid last year to support the depleting balance of payment. The country received its first tranche last year.
This is a three year programme and IMF is conducting periodic reviews. We, on the part of the Treasury, briefed them on the fiscal sector of the country as to how we are going to manage the budget deficit and related matters. The ongoing computerization programme of the Inland Revenue Department and the current status of Value Added Tax (VAT) were also explained. How to improve the performances of state owned institutions such as the Sri Lankan Airlines, National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Ceylon Electricity Board and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation were also discussed. The requirement is to get them at least to the break-even level of performance he said.
He said the visiting IMF delegation would hold several rounds of discussions with various stakeholders including the Central Bank in the coming days.

Chelsea surge 11 points clear, Leicester into bottom three
LONDON, Saturday - Chelsea's processional march towards the Premier League title continued at Swansea City's expense on Saturday as reigning champions Leicester City dropped into the bottom three.
Antonio Conte's side were not firing on all cylinders against a resolute Swansea side managed by their former assistant coach Paul Clement but second-half goals by Pedro and Diego Costa made sure of a 3-1 victory.
They are 11 points ahead of Manchester City who have 13 games left and while Italian Conte is too cagey to start preparing the Prosecco yet, only a monumental loss of form looks like denying him the title in his first season in charge.
Tottenham Hotspur, the only other top-four side in league action this weekend, could trim Chelsea's lead to 10 points if they win at home to Stoke City.
It's important to continue this way. We need 29 points to be sure of winning the league, Conte told reporters.
Chelsea's victory made it mathematically impossible for Leicester to catch them as they are 42 points behind the leaders going into their home clash with Liverpool on Monday - their first fixture since the sacking of manager Claudio Ranieri.
Leicester will start that game third-bottom after Crystal Palace's 1-0 victory over Middlesbrough at Selhurst Park on Saturday took them out of the relegation zone.
Patrick van Aanholt's 34th-minute goal was enough to lift Palace to 17th place with 22 points, one ahead of Leicester and Hull City, who drew 1-1 at home with Burnley.
The three points are important as it puts us in amongst the pack, out of the bottom three and a bit closer to Bournemouth, Palace manager Sam Allardyce said.
Boro also have 22 points but are sliding towards the drop zone after nine league games without a win.
Bournemouth, too, are being sucked into the relegation battle after a 2-1 defeat at West Bromwich Albion despite taking a fourth-minute lead through Josh King's penalty. Craig Dawson and Gareth McAuley replied for West Brom, who are eighth.
In-form Everton continue to harbour hopes of catching the top four and beat bottom club Sunderland 2-0 to move within six points of fourth-placed Arsenal.
Romelu Lukaku made the points safe for Everton with 10 minutes remaining, taking his tally for the season to 17, level at the top of the scoring charts with Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez. Sunderland's fourth defeat in six left them on 19 points.
There is a gap between us and the teams above us but there are still 12 games to go, Everton manager Ronald Koeman said.
You need to continue and get the momentum.
Chelsea were made to work hard to dispatch a much-improved Swansea side despite taking a 19th-minute lead when Cesc Fabregas scored on his 300th Premier League appearance.
Fernando Llorente scored from Swansea's first real chance on the cusp of halftime, heading in after Gylfi Sigurdsson found him with a quickly-taken free kick. Swansea were denied a penalty midway through the second half when Cesar Azpilicueta got away with a clear handball.
That was a big moment. Who knows what would have happened Swansea boss Paul Clement, returning to the club where he was assistant coach, said as he reflected on the defeat.
Shortly afterwards Pedro's shot squirmed past keeper Lukasz Fabianski before Diego Costa, the fourth Spaniard of the day to hit the target, made the points safe with a volley for his 16th league goal of the season.

Much ado about standards
Any educationist would undoubtedly agree that the Sri Lankan education system is heavily flawed. These flaws are mostly observed in private education institutes, though some state education institutes are no better.
What the private education institutes lack mostly is the required standards in par with government regulations. These private institutes come up with fresh courses. Their intention is clear: to rake in money by hook or by crook. There is nothing wrong in any money-making venture. However, standards should be respected as well as adhered to at the same time. Standards are equally important as profits.
On the other hand most of the fresh courses are quite alien to the students. The plain show-off of a range of courses, both short term and long term, tempt a large crowd. This crowd includes pupils fresh out of school as well as their parents who want their children to better in education.
However they are blissfully unaware about the inferior standards of the education they are going to bestow their children with. Private institutes mushroom only to attract and fascinate a large crowd of innocent ignorant pupils.
Worse still, the private institutions lack discipline. They are aiming at the rich students for the sake of raking in more monies.

Through this new method we have been able unite these institutions together to develop the Colombo Port while protecting their unique identity.
Thereby all the stakeholders have been contributed to develop the Colombo Port a one team. In addition to that a project is being implemented for the sake of infrastructure development in the Colombo Port.

Connecting classrooms
The British Council hosted media and guests at an event to celebrate UK-Sri Lanka Partnership Dialogue under the theme of Responsible Education for the 21st Century. The event was held at the Mahaweli Reach Hotel in Kandy recently.
This initiative is linked to British Councils Schools Programme, which aims to connect the UK and Sri Lankan school sectors to enrich education, promote global citizenship and build international trust and understanding.
The programme helps teachers bring awareness and understanding of global issues to young people by linking classrooms and schools, between the UK, Sri Lanka and other overseas countries. Since 2012 the programme has supported over 300 links, delivered courses and online training to over 1000 Sri Lankan teachers and enhanced the leadership skills of 150+ other head teachers across Sri Lanka.
The focus of the 21st century skills training is embedding 21st century learning skills into local classroom practices.
This was initiated in June 2015. The training offered professional development opportunities for Sri Lankan teachers and head teachers on six 21st century skills through classroom based educational action research.
These skills are; student leadership and personal development, citizenship, communication and collaboration, critical thinking and problem solving, creativity and imagination, and digital literacy.
After completing classroom action research, teachers were eligible to apply for professional partnership and with a partner school in the UK. Over an 18 month period the British Council has trained 800 teachers and 250 head teachers via this course.
The Central Province in particular was a keen partner, with 5 out of 11 successful partnerships. 190 teachers and head teachers received the above training from the central province.
Commenting on the initiative, British Council Country Director Keith Davies said, We strongly believe that there is no substitute for a determined and accomplished teacher in the classroom. At a time when everything can be found on the internet, equipping our teachers with the right skills to communicate with the 21st century student is vital. Our training has produced a strong cohort of teachers to take charge of the classroom with new learnings and vision.
11 UK schools and 22 delegates participated in the event alongside their local counterparts, along with a group of selected head teachers, trainers and British Council School Ambassadors, from the Central Province who had successfully completed the training programme.- St. Joseph's Academy.

Did not hunt for Lankan asylum seekers in Hong Kong
The Sri Lankan Police yesterday rejected foreign media reports that its investigators were in Hong Kong looking for the Lankan asylum seekers who sheltered American whistle-blower Edward Snowden.A recent foreign news report quoting a Lawyer said to be representing the refugees in Hong Kong said Sri Lankan refugees who sheltered fugitive whistle-blower Edward Snowden in Hong Kong have been targeted by law enforcement officers from their home country.
The Media Spokesman for Police, Deputy Inspector General Priyantha Jayakody in a statement said on behalf of the criminal investigation department, he was denying the involvement of any investigations or surveillance conducted against the Sri Lankan families or their relatives living in Sri Lanka who are said to have sheltered Edward Snowden in Hong Kong.
Further we confirm these allegations are frivolous unfounded and baseless. Also Sri Lanka Police would like to inform that except for a Police officer in the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police who attended the cyber crime investigation training for Eurasian region organized by the Interpol held from 28th November to 2 nd December 2016 in Hong Kong, no other Police officer attached to criminal investigation department visited Hong Kong in an official capacity Jayakody in the statement said.
He went on to say that in some instances the Police have come across lawyers representing asylum seekers who are in the habit of propagating false allegations against officers involved maintaining law and order with the ulterior motive of supporting the claim of their clients.

Environmental issues raised
Construction will commence in March on the Indola Dusit Thani complex in Balapitiya, a 20-storey mega-development project that will sit directly on the coastline.
The development, costing Rs. 3 billion, includes two residential towers, eight pools, 15 restaurants, and an art convention and exhibition centre. One-bedroom units will sell for just under $250,000 and three-bedroom apartments will cost around $750,000.A promotional video for the project notes that the buildings are the one and only beachfront development available to foreign investors, and that they will sit on 450 metres of pristine, absolute beach front. This is in violation of a law that states hotels must be built a minimum 300 metres from the sea.
However, the Coastal Conservation Department has approved the project.
When queried about the projects environmental impact, Coastal Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Acting Director General B. K. Prabath Chandrakeerthi said: I do not want to answer that. All I will say is that the development was approved by relevant authorities.He also did not respond to queries regarding the future of Sri Lankas coastline, as high-rise buildings such as the Dusit Thani and 11-storey Weligama Marriot set the precedence for further coastal development.
There are high-risers on the coast already. Just have a look at Colombo, Chandrakeerthi added.
An environmental engineer expressed his concern regarding the project on the condition of anonymity.
This project is a clear violation of the countrys environmental laws and will negatively impact coastal ecosystems, the engineer said.

Etiquette: The prime guideline for manners
What is the difference between etiquette and manners The two words are closely related but have faintly different meanings. While both these concepts go hand in hand and involve rules of behaviour, they are slightly different and involve different types of skills. Etiquette is a code of behaviour, while manners refer to the behaviour itself. In terms of usage, one who understands etiquette and puts it into practice has good manners.
To be more precise, etiquette is a set of rules dealing with exterior form. Manners are an expression of inner character. Manners are specific actions such as saying please and thank you, holding the door open for someone, chewing with your mouth closed among other behaviour. Having good manners basically means being polite.
Using proper etiquette
A child writing
Etiquette is more like the rules or guidelines for when and where you use those manners. It answers questions such as: When is it appropriate to write a thank you note Is it okay to ask for cash as a gift Do I need to invite my ex-mother-in-law to my bachelorette party Using proper etiquette basically means doing what is expected or acceptable in a certain situation.
Etiquette and manners are both critical to functioning in society. They also vary from culture to culture, as standards of conduct are heavily based on cultural tradition and heritage. The primary distinction between etiquette and manners is that the first includes specific rules of conduct, while the other is more generalized. Manners involve general behavioural guidelines, such as treating the elderly with respect and courtesy. Etiquette is a specific code of behaviour, with an example of etiquette being knowledge of the proper mode of address for a queen, which is, incidentally: "Your Majesty." In some societies, people regard etiquette as elitist and unnecessarily refined, but this is actually not the case.
Many of the rules of etiquette are already practiced by people with good manners, and a demonstration of familiarity with etiquette and manners will mark someone as cultured, polite company. People are typically taught manners from a very young age so that they grow up accustomed to the basic rules of conduct about appropriate behaviour in social situations.
Children learn, for example, that it is not polite to stare, to point their fingers at people, to make personal comments, or to cast aspersions upon the selection of food at a dinner. In childhood, people usually absorb lessons about how to treat others and how to behave in a variety of situations. Manners often become second nature when they are taught at a young age. The lessons children learn early will stay with them and become life skills just like reading, writing, and arithmetic. We are not born with these skills. In order for these skills to become part of us, they need to be put into practice regularly.
Etiquette trainers
In order to learn etiquette people must take specific lessons, as opposed to learning by example or through gentle correction. Rather than learning general rules about how to behave at a dinner, someone would learn specifically about which cutlery to use when how the table of precedence works, and how to politely dispose of undesirable food items. Etiquette training also involves how to deal with introductions, and how to behave in numerous environments from funerals to all types of functions.
Extending a handshake with a smile
The field has also expanded beyond society manners. Today, many big businesses employ etiquette trainers whose job it is to teach good manners to executives. Etiquette trainers not only show business people how to dress and act  how to eat and converse in proper company, but they also train them how to become more successful in their companies and in the business world by providing lessons on such peripheral items as writing good business letters. With global society becoming much closer, executives having a background in societal and cultural differences have a much better chance not to offend as well as a greater success rate if they can demonstrate good etiquette skills. Hundreds of etiquette coaches exist in business today.
Both etiquette and manners rely on basic underlying principles which include treating people with respect, being sensitive to social situations, and making other people feel comfortable. People cannot learn etiquette without being schooled in manners, which lays the underlying groundwork for the rules of etiquette. Formal training in etiquette can be obtained through finishing schools, in which an instructor takes people through the rules of etiquette, or by reading texts which deal with etiquette and manners in particular societies.
Knowledge of etiquette and manners is never wasted. Someone with an awareness of manners and formal etiquette will be remembered, and this may come to his or her advantage in the future. Manners are empowering and are an integral part of success.
Good manners
Having good manners helps an individual build confidence, increase self esteem, and improve communication skills. Good manners and etiquette help people make friends more easily and create positive impressions on others. We only have one chance to make a first impression! Manners provide an extra edge that will make the difference between you and the other person.
Far too often we are preoccupied with how life affects us. Putting the needs of others before self is not only liberating, it has far-reaching benefits for the individual and the betterment of society as a whole. Giving a helping hand with a heavy package will lighten a burden. Holding the door for a stranger can be contagious. Looking a person in the eye and extending a handshake with a smile can brighten the day.
If we stop to think how our behaviour affects others, we can make better choices. In turn, a well-mannered individual will be considered gracious and stand out in the crowd, not to mention serve as a model example to others. Research shows people cannot be truly successful in relationships without civility.
When we dont have successful relationships, it is unlikely that we will find happiness in life. Did you know that giving a compliment is like giving a gift to someone that doesnt cost you anything Good manners are not about doing everything perfectly right, they are about being thoughtful and using common sense, about choosing civility over rudeness.
Additionally, etiquette and protocol provide the guidelines for individuals to manage social and business environments effectively. Equally important, manners create civility which helps people resolve conflict and confrontation without aggression. Practicing good manners earns respect. When we feel confident in social situations, we are able to relax, put our best foot forward and enjoy ourselves.

Extra land for public use
The new agreement between the Sri Lankan government and China for the Colombo Port City and Financial City has renegotiated extra land for public use, the Daily News reliably learns.
According to the new Port City agreement, the new park area will be eight times larger than the Galle Face Green. Apart from this, the project will also create a 3 km-long beach area (13 hectares) for public use.Only 35 percent of the reclaimed land will be occupied by buildings.
According to official sources, all infrastructure within the reclaimed area will be built by the Project Company, without placing that burden on the Government.
As per the agreement signed by the previous regime, infrastructure and utility connections to the periphery of the site will remain the responsibility of the Government. However, under the new 2016 agreement, the Government has the right to request the Project Company to enter into a Public-Private-Partnership for the provision of such infrastructure.
Another change is the maintenance of the reclaimed area and associated infrastructure which was previously assigned to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
Now, a new JV company between the Project Company and a party to be nominated by the Government will undertake the Estate Management responsibility, working in cooperation with relevant local authorities such as the Colombo Municipal Council.
Apart from this, the land used for public purposes such as roads, parks, pedestrian walkways etc. would be increased by 44 percent, which was the main reason for the expansion of the reclaimed area from 233 to 269 hectares.
This would provide the general public with an overall area of 91 hectares for their use and another 62 hectares to the Government for development purposes.
The marketable land is estimated to be over Rs. 200 Billion going on todays value. According to the new agreement, 57 percent of the total 269 hectares of reclaimed land would be for the benefit of the Government and the people of Sri Lanka.

FCID earns its spurs
The Police Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) has come in for heavy flak by the Joint Opposition from the very day it was established exactly two years ago, and not surprisingly. The special police unit had not just caused huge embarrassment to many among the JO but also nightmares to the top echelons of the former regime faced with allegations of financial crimes. But the FCID had soldiered along, undaunted, going by the highly complicated cases it has cracked, revealing the sordid details of financial skulduggery. It could justly be proud of itself, not just for the good work done, but also the contribution it is making to the state coffers.
According to our weekend publication, the Sunday Observer, the FCID which completed two years yesterday (26) had raised nearly Rs.1 billion through the detection of misappropriated state and unduly earned assets by politicians through its investigations. It goes on to give out a list of VIP politicians and those near and dear to them under probe. Prominent in this list is Basil Rajapaksa, the super minister in the former regime. Among the major assets in illegal possession of BR, recovered, are the house and land in Orutota, valued at over Rs. 50 million, and the land and house seized at Brown Hill Matara, also worth over Rs. 50 million. There is also the house in Malwana, which is much in the news these days, jointly owned by BR and Thirukumar Nadesan, a wheeler dealer businessman and close Rajapaksa relative, said to be worth over Rs. 200 million. The property is slated to be auctioned in the coming days and the proceeds remitted to the Treasury.
The senior Rajapaksa apart, the FCID has also tightened the noose around the other members of the Rajapaksa family. It has taken over the building and equipment of the CSN TV channel and another Rs. 163 million recovered following investigations into CSN operations. According to the Observer report, the FCID, during the two year period had investigated 74 out of the 322 cases referred to it and says that a stream of arrests are imminent as it had completed investigations into many cases and awaiting the response of the Attorney General.
The FCID should be commended for rising to the challenge and going to great lengths to unravel the corrupt acts under the former regime. Its officers were doing their job at risk to themselves with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa himself issuing direct threats at this special police unit at public rallies, investigating the doings of his siblings and progeny. The FCID is also being called names by JO politicians and certain media with some cantankerous elements threatening to shut down the Unit when it came to power and taking to task the officers involved in the investigations. One newspaper, partial to the Rajapaksas, continues to call it the Gestapo of the government, overlooking the fact that it is just another unit of the police, employing men of special skills, to carry out complicated investigations where the trail of the ill got wealth had been cleverly concealed.
Be that as it may, the public are yet skeptical if the big fish will be nabbed. This is because those who committed day light robbery are still walking freely and, what is more, are even going places. This naturally has brought about a sense of frustration among the public who believed those who plundered the national wealth would be brought to justice no sooner the Yahapalanaya government took office. They will not appreciate the fact that the justice system is a long drawn out process and, what is more, successful prosecution is not a certainty, given the law as it stands. The talk everywhere is ko elluwa Instead what they see everyday on television is those, against whom serious allegations were made, beaming from ear to ear and making public statements with a panache.
The government, therefore, should take steps to speed up the process of justice in this connection and even appoint a special tribunal as suggested by Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama on the lines of the Criminal Justice Commission of yore. Wrong doers are getting emboldened with each passing day, with nothing happening. On the contrary, they have now trained their guns on the government and are seen trooping to the Bribery Commission with a so called Top Ten list of Ministers. Certainly, wrong doers in the present government too should be probed. Even the President is on record saying there are rogues in government, both, then and now. But this should not detract from the main mission of the government to go after the big names of the former regime who are said to have stashed their loot in overseas accounts.
The Yahapalanaya mandate was to nab these rogues, plunderers and fraudsters and return the billions to the country. The FCID has managed to recover only Rs. 1 billion worth of stolen assets so far. This, as many would agree, is just a drop in the bucket. More so, considering the nature of the allegations made during the hustings.

The Garden of your choice !
We instinctively love to be surrounded by the beauty of nature. Because it soothes the mind and it benefits us in so many ways. It gives us our food and in today's urban environment - in a world of concrete jungles - it preserves our sanity. Today Garden Talk speaks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture, District Agriculture Instructor Ratmalana K.N.K Jayathilake on Edible Landscaping - creating gardens that benefits the mind and body.
"The creation of gardens is a scientific process as well as a form of art. It is about planning your garden and beautifying it by growing a variety of plants. This gives you great satisfaction. Most people in Sri Lanka are engaged in this activity and receive great pleasure from it. It stimulates the mind and helps one live in harmony with the natural environment," said Jayathilake
Planting flowers
When beautifying one's garden one can grow many flowers, bushes and trees that provide shading and one can maintain ones lawn. In addition to this you can even include waterfalls.
"When it comes to Sri Lanka, the beautification of gardens has been practised throughout the centuries and we have had a history of beautifying our gardens from the time of our kings. One good example is the Water Gardens of Sigiriya. Another example is Anuradhapura Mahameuna Uyana. The designing and planning our home gardens is our Sri Lankan Pride," stated Jayathilake
Bio Diversity has been a feature of our home gardens. While living in harmony with nature, the gardens have been an economic strength, serving the needs of the family.
"These home gardens reduce the tension in the mind. They also create a pleasurable and refreshing coolness. When beautifying your home gardens, why not even grow some vegetables In addition to making the garden attractive you can also use these plants for consumption. Flower can only project beauty but if you grow vegetables it will serve you economically providing a healthy food intake," added9 Jayathilake
K.N.K Jayathilake
Take the Anuradhapura Era, Sigiriya Era, Pollonnaruwa Era and Mahanuwara Era, beautification of gardens was practised right throughout.
"When beautifying gardens we must follow certain principles. If we can follow those principles we can achieve our goal."
There has to be unity.
When growing plants there needs to be uniformity. Similar flowers have to be collected together. There need to be borders. Plants of similar height and type need to be put together. Similar plants in pots should be put together. It has to match well with each other.
There needs to be balance
If you split the garden by one line, varieties of vegetables and flowers on one side should match with the vegetables and flowers on the other side. That makes it look more attractive.
Scale
The garden must be in proportion with the building. If the building is tall and the plants are small, then there is less attraction. If the buildings are small and the plants are large, then the building is covered. The roads, beds, lawns have to be in proportion. Features need to be in proportion.
There needs to be diversity
There needs to be a variety. There should be flowers, fruits, bushes, vegetables, ornamental plants, medicinal plants. There needs to be a diversity and variety. That is what makes a great garden.
Important factors
The soil is important. How fertile it is. So depending on that you administer organic manure. This is for the development of the plant.
There needs to be a good drainage system. If with the rainfall the garden gets flooded, it will be difficult to maintain it. There needs to be a good drainage system for the water to go out.
Sunlight is important for the growth of plants. You have to see where the sunlight falls in your home garden and use those places to grow plants.
Plants need sunlight in varying degrees. Some plants need a lot of it and shade loving plants need a less amount. So you need to identify in your gardens where the sunlight falls and its amounts.
If you are mindful of these factors then your productivity will go up.
"We need to also consider the environmental problems we face. If your house is near a road, there may be a lot of noise pollution. Then there is also the dust. So you need to have a plan as to what you can do to prevent these things. Also the sunlight that falls may be too intense. The wind may be too strong. For this you need to grow appropriate plants. So you need to identify the location. We can organize our garden to shield us from these problems by growing plants," explained Jayathilake
Concealing imperfection
Sometimes there could be an imperfection in the view. We can use the trees to conceal this.
"It may be an old dilapidated building. We can grow the trees to hide the view. Sometimes the garden can have natural benefits. The Garden may have ponds. So we must make use of these natural attributes to make our garden beautiful," pointed out Jayathilake
We can also use colors to our benefit. Various plants have flowers with various colors. Even fruits and vegetables have their own colors. You need to use these various colors to your advantage when designing your garden.
"Primary colors are Red, Blue and Yellow. Secondary colors are Purple, Orange and Green. Tertiary colors Yellow Orange, Red Orange, Red Violet, Blue Violet, Blue Green and Yellow Green. So we need to think of these color combinations and grow our plants. We can grow fruits, flowers and Vegetables with these different colors. We can grow fruit trees that produce flowers with these different colors. With these you can create a contrast in the garden. You can create so many color combinations," noted Jayathilake

Gatecrashes top 10 after Dubai title
DUBAI, Saturday - Seventh seed Elina Svitolina overpowered former world number one Caroline Wozniacki 6-4 6-2 to claim the Dubai Open on Saturday, the sixth, and biggest, title of her career.
Ukrainian Svitolina, who stopped Angelique Kerber from returning to the top of the rankings by beating the German in Friday's semi-finals, triumphed in one hour 28 minutes.
Svitolina converted one of her four break points against the Dane, winner in 2011, in the opening set to move ahead and dominated thereafter.
The 22-year-old, who dropped only one set throughout the week, will move into the WTA's top 10 for the first time after starting the week ranked 13th.
I dreamed all my life to be in the top 10, so it's an amazing feeling to enter the top 10 by winning the tournament, she said in a court-side interview. I am very excited for the season.
I played some amazing tennis this week. It's a first trophy for me in such a big tournament.
Tenth seed Wozniacki had been hoping to become only the third player to win multiple titles in Dubai, joining Justine Henin and Venus Williams who won the title four and three times respectively.
Instead, for the second week running she fell at the final hurdle, having lost to Karolina Pliskova in Doha last week, as she continues her comeback after an injury-hit 2016.
It has been a good two weeks -- two finals, lots of matches. I'm already excited to be back, said Wozniacki.

Gazzette No.1895/19 unique example of fraudulent management of public debt
The Finance Ministry is set to investigate the controversial Extraordinary Gazette notification on the issuance of bonds by the Central Bank, dated January 01, 2015.
Referring to Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 1895/19 dated January 1, 2015 issued by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Minister of Finance and Planning at the time, the Ministry of Finance yesterday said the gazette is a unique example of fraudulent management of public debt by Rajapaksa, Ajith Nivard Cabraal and his colleagues in the Central Bank in violation of laws ,in the past.
Issuing a media statement the ministry said, the Minister of Finance is in receipt of Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 1895/19 dated 01 January 2015 issued by Mahinda Rajapaksa, Minister of Finance and Planning at that time.
This Gazette was revealed during evidence given by the Secretary to Ministry of Finance on 23 February 2017 to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Treasury bond issuances.
The ministry in the statement made several interim clarifications while awaiting a full scale investigation. The interim clarifications made by the ministry are as follows;
The gazette contains authorization given under section 4 of the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance to raise loans during the year 2015 through issuance of 31 Treasury bonds of different redemption periods at different interest rates at auctions as notified by the Registrar of Public Debt through newspapers.
The bonds stipulated in the gazette include many bonds issued in the past at various interest rates since 2011 as well as new bonds. There is no indication as to how bonds already issued in the past are issued again in 2015. It appears that the Gazette authorizes the past bonds also.
As per the gazette, loans will be raised through those bonds within the sum of Rupees one thousand seven hundred and eighty billion authorized in the Appropriation Act, No. 41 of 2014.
The practice that has been followed in the past by the Central Bank is to issue this gazette back-dated as January 1 each year after issuing all bonds during the year in a hidden attempt to comply with the requirement of the Section 4 of the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance while mismanaging bond issuances.
When issuing this gazette, the required protocol has not been followed. With regard to issuance of a gazette by any Minister, the relevant institution should send the draft to the Secretary of the line Ministry. The Secretary then obtains the legal and technical clearance from the relevant officials in the Ministry and submits the gazette for the signature of the Minister. Only after the Ministers signature, the gazette is sent to the Government Printer to publish. The Central Bank has not followed this procedure on this gazette in the recent past. Instead, the Superintendent of the Public Debt Department has directly sent it to the Government Printer after getting the legal clearance from the Central Bank lawyers.
Information is available that the gazette dated 1 January 2016 to be published in the name of Ravi Karunanayake, Minister of Finance, for the year 2016 also has already been sent to the Government Printer the same way in 2017. The publication of this gazette was immediately withheld.
As such, all Treasury bonds have been issued in violation of the provisions of the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance. This is how the Central Bank officers, so called experts and professionals, mismanaged public debt to facilitate Mahinda Rajapaksa Government and Ajith Nivaard Cabral through questionable private placements of bonds. In such gazettes issued in the past, all private placements were also legalized as issuance at auctions announced by the Registrar of Pubic Debt.
A full report will be issued to the media after investigations and corrective actions will be taken immediately. Appropriate legal actions will be taken against those errant officers under the provisions of the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance.

Giving Voice !
Art has no limits. It is not confined to a few. It has no barriers. It inspires and influences expressionism. There is something finely detailed and cultivated about art. It is its beauty of balance which unites all and links us with other cultures across the world.
ABRSM Representative for Sri Lanka and Colombo Cultural Hub Trust Chairman Mano Chanmugam
We are all born with an innate desire to express ourselves and art encompasses a wider range of activities than you may have ever imagined. Moreover art also has a therapeutic quality which soothes the mind and horns skills. More and more spaces need to come up to make it comfortable for people from all walks of life to see and enjoy art. This is where the Colombo Cultural Hub Trust (CCHT) comes into the picture. Their mission is to make Colombo the cultural centre for South Asia.
No bed of roses
The project was proposed more than a year ago. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe beckoned Neomal De Alwis and myself to him and stated his wish to open Colombo for international art and cultural performances. He wished to divulge our culture to the rest of the world and bring in the cultures of other countries so that the future generation will have the opportunity of experiencing international cultural and art forms on local soil, ABRSM Representative for Sri Lanka and Colombo Cultural Hub Trust Chairman Mano Chanmugam said. On embarking on this mission, one of the major issues we have noted is that the performing and visual arts theaters in Colombo are not acoustically friendly. For example the Nelum Pokuna needs a lot of improvement for natural sounds. The new John De Silva Memorial Theatre, the renewed Elphinstone theatre and Navarangahala too fall under this category. We brought down an acoustics expert from England to look into this matter and he has given us basic instructions to improve Nelum Pokuna. We have been given three years to bring up the standards of these venues so that we will be the best in Asia, Chanmugam added.
However he notes that it will take time to achieve this target. The path is no bed of roses and with limited funds in hand the mission is quite a challenge for the team. However considering the plus points that the project will reap for the country they are determined to overcome the hurdles and venture towards their goal.
The thirst for the arts is a magnet for foreigners to come and be a part in the activities. Therefore art related activities have always been a tremendous boost for cultural tourism in Sri Lanka.
The CCHTs first step is to hold the Asia Pacific Choir Games in Sri Lanka. The event, a brainchild of INTERKULTUR, an international top address for major musical events in the choral community, will take place in Colombo from October 21 to 28. This will be the first time that an INTERKULTUR event will be held in South Asia. Thousands of competitors from different competing nations will perform in a variety of venues turning the city into a hub for Asia-Pacific choral music.
ABRSM Assistant Representative for Sri Lanka andColombo Cultural Hub Trust Directorof Operations
Neomal De Alwis
The public would get the opportunity to watch the choirs performing during the competition free of charge. There will be free entrance to the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the workshops. Though some of the special performances might be ticketed, students will be issued free passes or tickets at a concession rate.
Non professional choirs from across the world will take part in the event in the Open Competition, Asia Pacific Champions Competition and Grand Prix of Nations. Childrens choirs, youth choirs, adult choirs (mixed, male, female choirs), Musica Sacra a cappella, Musica Sacra with accompaniment, Gospel, Spiritual, music of spirit and faith, jazz, pop, show, folklore a cappella and folklore with accompaniment are the categories on offer. Evaluation performances (non-competing), individual coaching, singing together, friendship and celebration concerts in and around Colombo and the festival stage choir project are some of the other events that go along with the Asia Pacific Choir Games.
A learning experience
INTERKULTUR has been organizing such events for around two decades. The principal event is the World Choir Games which is modeled upon the Olympics. It is held every two years. It took place in Russia in 2016 and the next one will be in South Africa in 2018. The Asia Pacific Choir Games is an event which leads up to the World Choir Games. It is almost like the Common Wealth Games or the SAARC Games which paves way for the Olympics, said Colombo Cultural Hub Trust Director of Programs Soundarie David Rodrigo.
She noted that the international choir competition winners get world rankings and this makes them eligible to compete at a global competition of a bigger scale. More than 100 choirs have shown interest to fly to Sri Lanka to take part in the Asia Pacific Choir Games. However the team is expecting more than 4000 participants to join in. Local choirs too will be given a chance to take part as long as they meet the criteria of having taken part in an international choir competition or winning a national event or having gotten a recommendation from a council member.
The Asia Pacific Choir Games will not only be a centre of entertainment and competition but it will be a learning experience for many as well. A large number of renowned musical experts will be taking part in the event. They will be conducting workshops for schools and choirs. The CCHT team also hopes to get groups from all over the island including the North and East to take part in the event.
When competitions of such international repute are being held abroad our local choirs cannot afford to venture to that country to take part in the event. It is a costly process where air tickets have to be bought and accommodation matters solved. They also have to pay registration fees. Since this event will be held in Sri Lanka local choirs are welcome to take part in the event without any hassle, Chanmugam noted adding that other art forms too will be inculcated into the Asia Pacific Choir Games. They have already decided to include a street art parade to run parallel to the event.

The CCHT was set up as a public-private partnership and an outreach program which will reach out to every corner in the island. The trustees are Tower Hall Foundation Director General Lionel Fernando, University of Visual and Performing Arts Vice Chancellor Prof Sarath Amunugama, Central Cultural Fund Director General Prof Prishanta Gunawardena, and Arts Council Director Prof Chandraguptha Thenuwara.
Chanmugam noted that to get down the best artistes in the world is costly. The Prime Minister wishes to host a combined music festival where Bollywood meets Pakistan music. They have also spoken to the Russian Cultural Centre hoping to bring down a renowned ballet troupe.
We wish to bring down the stars who are reigning in their fields today. It is not the stars from the past that we have in mind here. Since they are in demand it is very expensive to bring them down to Sri Lanka. We have brought down Danielle de Niese and Shani Diluka too will be coming to perform soon. These are artistes of Sri Lankan origin, ABRSM Assistant Representative for Sri Lanka and Colombo Cultural Hub Trust Director of Operations Neomal De Alwis said.
Sri Lankans diverse
Another vision of the Prime Minister is to set up a professional state orchestra and a combined band orchestra using the armed forces. He has also entrusted the CCHT with the task of holding a national Baila Festival. He knew how popular Baila is in the country and it will also appeal to countries like Portugal, Spain, Brizil, Russia etc. It will captivate masses and showcase Sri Lankans diverse talents to the world, De Alwis noted adding that the CCHT is a platform which will take Sri Lankan aesthetic talents to the world.
They hope to promote women artists by linking them with Marie Alles. A film festival too is in talks for the future.
All the great hits are currently being digitized at the National Film Corporation. Once that process is done we hope to screen these to the public. We hope to branch out to areas where we would form links with other countries and hold international film festivals in the coming years, De Alwis explained.
Speaking about the enthusiasm towards choir music in Sri Lanka Rodrigo said that she feels that the musical genre has really caught up in the past few years. I took the Holy Family Convent Senior Choir to an international competition in Wales for the first time in 2004. They were placed first runners up in the youth choir category. Then Soul Sounds was born, setting a trend so that other choirs too were motivated to compete at international competitions. The choristers get to interact with each other at such events and gain an array of experiences. Singing together really brings people together, she opined.

Government must stick to their election promises
Election promises must be kept by the government if they wish to safeguard the validity of the current political system, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to the minister, the common declaration with President Maithripala Sirisena was signed to form the Government two years ago at the Viharamahadevi Park in Colombo and he had to come back to the same place after two years to hear the grievances of the staff in the education sector.
The minister was addressing the gathering after attending politically victimised employees' meeting in the education sector.
Minister Senaratne said relief should be given for those subjected to political victimisation since 1994.
The Government had prepared a list of 10,000 employees and 4,000 were selected to offer relief.
But it was questionable whether the relief was offered properly.
It is the Government responsibility to offer relief to all politically victimised public servants equally. Otherwise, they would be disappointed. It was they who brought this Government into power. But their problems have not been solved.
Arrangements will be made to solve the issues after having discussion with the Cabinet.

The chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket Medical Board Professor Arjuna de Silva said that Mathews is gradually recovering from his hamstring injury and is already doing some exercises. He is doing workouts in the gymnasium and from next week he will be batting at the nets. If everything goes right he will be able to play in the One-Day Internationals against the visitors by end of March.
Veteran Rangana Herath who led Sri Lanka to a 2-0 win in the Test Series against Zimbabwe is tipped to take over the captaincy from Mathews for the Bangladesh series.

Have your own kitchen garden!
From growing pesticide-free vegetables to developing a new hobby, having your own kitchen garden has quite a lot of benefits. While most people shy away from gardening thinking that it needs a lot of space in the house, it's a myth. The only requirements are a lot of patience and perseverance. Here's a checklist for creating your own kitchen garden.
The space
While an open terrace is a good option when it comes to deciding a suitable space for growing your own veggies at home, any place with abundant sunlight like a windowsill is also apt. The idea is to choose a spot which is shady but also gets direct sunlight for four to five hours a day. Try covering the plants to prevent them from the scorching heat.
The containers
Other than earthen pots, you can also opt for old plastic bottles, buckets and bathtubs as containers to grow your veggies. They aren't only cost effective but promote re-cycling and reusing too. A medium-sized bathtub is ideal for growing plants like cabbages, cauliflowers, capsicums, radish and onions.
The soil
Getting the right mix of soil is an important step as the nutrients in the soil determine how healthy the plants would grow. Get some regular soil from a nursery, add compost coir peat and natural mannure to it. You can also add cow dung or goat dung to keep the soil all organic. Also, add vegetable peels and other wastes to the soil to create your own compost.
The seeds
Seeds can be easily bought from your local nursery. However one should go for open pollinated seeds than the hybrid ones. Once the seeds are sowed, it's ideal to cover the pot with a net till they grow into a sapling, to keep the birds and squirrels from eating them.
Tip for first timers
If you are a first time gardener, then go for a small pot and a single vegetable initially. Tomatoes, tulsi and chillies are easy to grow-- they can be placed near the window or in the living room and require less care.
Watering the plants
While regular watering is a key factor is growing plants, excess water can cause damage and also wash away nutrients from the soil. While you might require to water the plants twice during summers, watering them on alternate days is completely fine for winters. To make sure your plants get optimum water, check the moisture of the soil by pressing it with your fingers and then water the plant as per requirement. Remember to add manure to the soil after a heavy rainfall as excess rains can wash away nutrients from the soil.
Maintain your kitchen garden
Check your plants regularly and prevent insects from breeding. In case there are bugs on the plant, spraying Neem water might help in keeping the insects at bay.

On his timely intervention
Title: ESSAYS OF A LIFETIME CARLO FONSEKA
Author: Prof. Carlo Fonseka
There was a time when science was just one endeavour among many for the great scientists of the world. For example, Isaac Newton was a true polymath  a celebrated master of astronomy, chemistry, mathematics, physics and theology. Another polymath was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, more popularly known by his pen name Lewis Carroll. He was an Oxford mathematician, Anglican theologian, musician, author, publisher and political scientist to whom is attributed the electoral system of proportional representation which is presently the subject of raging debates in Sri Lanka and a matter of personal interest to me as I labour at the Election Commission in Sri Lanka.
Science now, however, is so specialized with small incremental advances that there are few polymaths today. Carlo Fonseka (MBBS (First Class), University of Ceylon; Ph D, University of Edinburgh; Emeritus Professor of Physiology at the University of Ceylon (now Colombo)) is exception  engaging in medicine, management of public bodies, theology, music, left-wing politics and many other things, and bringing these to the public through op-ed pieces, and radio and television talk shows.
The book under review consists of a collected volume of Fonsekas selected writings and speeches over a lifetime on diverse topics such as medicine, science, philosophy and ethics, religion, economics, politics, education, the arts, the biographies he has written and his travel experiences. The selection has 34 essays written between 1971 and 2014. Of particular note is the first chapter, appropriately titled To err was fatal1, wherein his honesty Fonseka details the five deaths he attributes to his erroneous interventions, where it is clear that he is being too hard on himself. Recent studies in the US showing that iatrogentic damage (defined as a state of ill-health or adverse effect resulting from medical treatment) is the third leading cause of death in the US, after heart disease and cancer prove Fonseka to be the incorrigible iconoclast he is for speaking of truths that other doctors are not comfortable with.
Much-loved public personality
The book has been positively reviewed before as is natural for one from a much-loved public personality. I do not wish to detail the book and take away the thrills of reading it. What I will focus on is Fonseka the man. For that is relevant to understanding what he writes and benefit from the lessons his life offers to us.
Fonseka graduated in medicine from the University of Ceylon and earned his doctorate from the University of Edinburgh. His doctoral work on how the pituitary gland puts out growth hormones has become the stuff of textbooks. Two of his papers have each been cited over 100 times.
Greatness in life involves the ability to communicate. Almost all great men evince this truth. Most successful men in Sri Lanka are products of the church and her schools which gave them their skills. To cite one striking example, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike was a product of Anglican education. Likewise, Fonseka is a complete product of the Roman Catholic Church and her St Josephs College, Colombo. His versatility with the English language is such that I have met a doctor who a generation later preserves his handwritten notes on physiology that he took down as Fonseka lectured, as a monumental work of literature.
Around the year 2004, we shared the same office while being members of the University Grants Commission of Sri Lanka and, in the absence of his secretary, I had the pleasure as his friend of typing his articles as he dictated. They were always perfect on the first go. (Unfortunately, the privileges of high-up government service had then prevented him from learning the computer. It now appears that he has become computerate, though not to the degree that he is literate.)
Fonseka is a man who is seen reading a different book each time one meets him, and can recite passages from books he read long ago. I rate him Sri Lankas best prose writer today. His literary skills brought him the editorship of the Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science in the late 1960s. He was also elected the President of the Section on Medical Sciences of the Association in 1986. His Presidential Address on the subject of human violence attracted the attention of the Head of State, who procured and perused the script.
Communication skills
However, communication skills alone are not enough for greatness. The absence of taboos is another dimension of greatness. For example, in his stark honesty, Fonseka once confessed to me of how his conjugal engagements early into marriage in his house officers quarters inordinately delayed him from visiting a patient in the ward. In his linguistic dexterity with command of the English language, he put it so elegantly whereas from another man it might have seemed crude vulgarity. It is that attitude and skill of his that gave the world the privilege of reading how medical negligence does lead to deaths even from caring, ethical doctors.
The medical school could not keep Fonseka engaged in the pedestrian activities of a university where today we:
i. Split what can be meaningful papers into small inane bits to play the numbers game (where administrators count papers because in the specialized world of science they cannot judge quality and depth through actually reading the papers and therefore just count papers for assessment).
ii. Have journals which will publish anything for a fee, and clever academics have created so many citation indexes that make a mockery of journal evaluations.
iii. See university administrations claiming that grant money is important as research because, in reality, overheads give them the best offices in a university.
iv. Recognize even university ranking is subject to gaming.
v. Every metric to measure quality is countered by clever academics by another metric they invent to cheat the system.
I am sure Fonseka saw this deterioration of the university ethos early and left behind his high-powered research in physiology to work on more important things like superstitions, politics and religion. By far his most successful endeavour is his world-famous demolition of the myths behind fire-walking. Drawing from my upcoming textbook: Carlo Fonseka became most famous for his scientific elucidation and personal demonstration of how fire-walking is done by Buddhist and Hindu devotees who walk across embers without burning themselves. He starred in a British documentary where he fire-walked, an area where others feared to tread and had come a cropper by fire-walking to show that it can be done by anyone. In the process they had burnt their soles badly.
To demonstrate that there is nothing religious, Fonseka and his team deliberately downed arrack (the local brew) and pork (which devotees abstain from to acquire spiritual power to do the magical walk) before successfully fire-walking in front of British TV cameras with British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clark watching (https://metavideos.com/video/ 1391344/fire-walk-by-prof-carlo-fonseka).
He came out with the rules of how it is done  walking fast without allowing the soles to heat enough to reach ignition point to burn the flesh, and making the rectangular fire bed wide to make it seem big while the length one walks across is narrow, thereby giving the impression of walking across a large bed of embers, etc. He showed that the thick soles of the fire walkers who never use footwear also helped.
Fonsekas forays into politics, however, were a disaster because, although he acted with integrity, his associates did not. As a member of the Trotskyite Lanka Sama Samasamaja Party (LSSP), Fonseka and his LSSP friends under the late N. M. Perera, did Tamils proud by standing up for Tamil rights and parity of status for the Tamil language with the Sinhalese language. However, as the LSSP realized that the policy was not winning them votes, they abandoned their noble ideals. Fonseka had to lapse into silence.
As the political culture in Sri Lanka deteriorated, he withdrew into religion and music, and cultivated a new public persona to match. Whether for better or worse I am unable to decide. He completed an M A degree in Buddhism. Initiated into Sinhalese music at St Josephs College, he has made a name for himself as a popular musician and one of his lyrics is now sung at Sinhalese weddings as the bride goes away. A dirge he composed was included in an award-winning Sinhalese movie.
Foreign travels
In 2005, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, widow of the slain leader Vijaya Kumaratunga (whose mother was Fonsekas first cousin) was rooting for her brother Anura Bandaranaike to succeed her as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party leader, while Mahinda Rajapaksa staked his own claim. Fonseka inclined towards Rajapaksa. In 2004, he wrote a newspaper piece on the Rajapaksas of Ruhuna, which is among the essays re-printed in this book.
Again later as the LSSP alliance with the Rajapaksa regime continued while the Government soured with the people, and was summarily voted out in presidential and general elections in the year 2015, his loyalty to the LSSP kept him silent as many unsavoury things happened. His foreign travels were limited because of his membership in a Communist Party. The US Embassy refused him a visa, but later relented because the visit was sponsored by WHO. This period saw Fonseka working quietly in administration. The best testament to his value as a person is that when the Government changed in 2015, he handed in his resignation from the posts of President of Sri Lanka Medical Council and Chairman of the Vijaya Kumaratunga Memorial Hospital at Seeduwa. However, his letter of resignation was promptly returned by the new President. Such is the perception of him as being politically conscious and yet above politics.
In conclusion we may say of Fonseka what Newtons tomb at Westminster Abbey says in Latin: Mortals rejoice that there has existed such and so great an ornament of the human race!
Thankfully, it is much too early for a real eulogy for Fonseka. God bless him and give us many more years of his insightful mind.

HNB crowned winners at The Bankers Debate 2016
Determined performances and decisive arguments across four hotly contested match ups helped HNB to clinch victory at the finals of The Bankers Debate 2016 held at Galadari Hotel recently.
Organised by the Association of Professional Bankers - Sri Lanka with a view to enhancing communication and presentation skills among professional bankers, the competition was based on the Cross Examination Debate Association rules requiring two-man teams from each bank to construct winning arguments in support or opposition to the topic: Banks should invest more in digital technology than in people to succeed in future.
We are certainly very proud of our performance at the Bankers Debate and I would firstly like to express my sincere gratitude to my team-mate, Nalindra Ferdinando and to the extended debate team which supported us every step of the way. We were also given vital advice and encouragement from our corporate and senior management teams and it was really through this combined team effort that HNB was able to achieve victory, HNB Senior Manager  Card Centre and Debate Team Captain, Roshantha Jayatunge stated. In that regard, he also expressed his thanks on behalf of HNB to the opposing teams including this years finalists from Sampath Bank for a highly competitive and well-contested debate series.
This competition has been an invaluable learning experience for myself and for HNB. The experience of debating on a challenging topic helped us to not only sharpen our debate skills but to actually gain a much deeper understanding of the value of both technological innovation and human resources. Coming at a time when HNB itself launched its New World Banking, focusing on Digital transformation, our Management has never lost sight of the importance of people and the power of what they can contribute. Being able to argue on both sides of this topic allowed the tension between these two concepts to come out more organically and as result, we were able to see new perspectives emerge which was very illuminating, Ferdinando added.
Given the many benefits that the competition gave rise to, Jayatunge urged Sri Lankas banking industry members to participate in future such events and thanked the Organizing committee for introducing the debate to its members.
This was a very challenging competition but through it, we were definitely able to hone our communications skills while improving our ability to think on our feet and act decisively under pressure and we feel these are qualities which should be cultivated both amongst bankers and Sri Lankans in general, Jayatunge concluded.
Commenting on the teams performance, Mrs Chiranthi Cooray, Chief Human Resource Officer of HNB had this to say, the Bank is very proud to see versatile and multi faceted stars in its fold. We encourage talent development initiatives in our quest for customer service excellence and the happiest workforce.

India to be fastest growing economy among G-20 nations: Moodys
India will be the fastest growing economy among G-20 countries clocking a 7.1 per cent growth in 2017, Moodys Investors Service said.
The Indian economy had slowed in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the withdrawal of 86 per cent of the currency in circulation, without an immediate replacement.
India is forecast to have the fastest growing economy among all G-20 countries with growth put at 7.1 per cent for 2017, down from a previous expectation of 7.5 per cent because of the effects of demonetisation, Moodys said.
With regard to global growth, Moodys said continuing cyclical recovery in global economic activity with growth in G-20 countries picking up modestly to 3 per cent in 2017 and 2018 from 2.6 per cent in 2016, but potential shifts in US policy add uncertainty to this forecast.
We note unusually high uncertainty around our global forecasts due to the wide range of outcomes that could arise from significant shifts in US policy on a number of domestic and international issues, including trade and immigration, Moodys VP and Senior Analyst Madhavi Bokil said.
The systemic risks to this forecast may stem from shifts in US trade policies, risks to global financial markets and emerging market economies if US interest rates were to rise faster than anticipated and/or the US dollar were to appreciate sharply.
Also there could be risks of a sudden and sharp deceleration in China and political and fragmentation risks in the EU and the euro area, Moodys said.
In the report titled Modest Acceleration in the Global Economy, but Shifting US Policies Inject Uncertainty, Moodys said there is a high risk of a significant protectionist shift in US trade policy and could inflict lasting damage to the global economy.
Regarding Asia, Moodys said Chinas economy stabilised around the official growth target of 6.7 per cent in 2016, but will likely continue to decelerate to 6.3 per cent and 6 per cent in 2017 and 2018.
Moodys expects that the US economy will get additional lift from a stimulative fiscal policy stance pushing growth above potential.
Accordingly, Moodys has revised its real GDP growth forecast to 2.4 per cent in 2017 and 2.5 per cent in 2018, from 2.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent, respectively.

India destroyer O'Keefe hailed as superhero
SYDNEY, Sunday  Steve O'Keefe gave a superhero performance in Australia's stunning three-day first Test win to change the landscape of their series in India, Australia's media said Sunday.
Left-arm spinner O'Keefe, known as SOK, captured the identical figures of six for 35 in both innings to spin Australia to a massive 333-run win over Test cricket's top-ranked team on a viciously turning track in Pune on Saturday.
It was Australia's first Test win in India since 2004 and ended the hosts unbeaten streak of 19 Tests in the opening match of the four-Test series.
O'Keefe was hailed a hero along with skipper Steve Smith's fighting first century in India and his 10th as Australia's captain.
Steve O'Keefe led Australia to one of its greatest Test victories on Indian soil with a superhero performance that rewrote the record books and humiliated the shellshocked hosts inside three days, the Sun-Herald said.
Australia will head to Bangalore for the second Test with genuine belief they can pull off what only a few days ago seemed like mission impossible and win just their second series on these shores since 1969.
The newspaper said such was the crushing nature of Australia's victory that it has changed the landscape of this series.
The Australian newspaper said it was a triumph India's billion-plus people didnt see coming.
History has been made. Australia has won its first game in India in almost 13 years. Steve OKeefe has put his name on an honour board among the very best the game has ever seen and India is in shock, Peter Lalor said.
A billion plus people didnt see this coming. A good 20 million plus Australians were of the same mind.
Nobody outside the camp gave Steve Smiths men a chance, but they romped it in. The best bit They beat the Indians at their own game.
The Sunday Telegraph said O'Keefe shattered 84 years of Test history on the sub-continent to pilot Australia to one of their most famous victories.
Written off as the worst Australian team to ever tour crickets most imposing fortress, a great sporting upset is now firmly on the cards, it said.
OKeefe's extraordinary match haul of 12-70 now stands alone as the best individual figures by an overseas spinner ever in the sub-continent since the first match India played way back in 1933.
Former Australia Test fast bowler Mitchell Johnson tweeted: And the coach of India says Steve O'Keefe is Steady. Well done Steady O'Keefe, keep it up.  AFP

INSEE Cement recognized with Green Platinum Award
At HarithaSihinaya 2017 for commitment to sustainability
As a strong advocate and practitioner of sustainable initiatives within the construction industry in Sri Lanka, INSEE Cement was lauded with the Green Platinum Award at HarithaSihinaya 2017, an educational and environmental exhibition organized by the North Western Provincial Council during February 12  14, 2017.
The award was presented by President Maithripala Sirisena, during the opening ceremony of the exhibition.
The North Western Provincial Council, the only provincial administrative body that has won at the National Energy Efficiency Awards, has focused heavily on energy savings and environmental best practices during the past few years.
With the North Western Provincial Energy Plan implemented in 2016, the provincial council then focused on reducing the carbon footprint across the geographical area under eight sectors, including construction, industrial, domestic and transportation.
The Exhibition was aimed at creating general public awareness and interest in sustainable initiatives and green energy under these eight sectors.
As one of the leading cement producers in the country contributing the construction sector, INSEE Cement invests in technology and expertise to reduce emission levels that result from different facets of the companys operation, recording the lowest emissions in cement production in Sri Lanka.
These efforts also resulted in the production of Sri Lankas first cement brand to be awarded the Green Labeling Certification by the Green Building Council; Sanstha, produced with 7kg less CO2 emissions per bag.
The INSEE Innovation & Application (I&A) Center too, collaborates with all stakeholders including architects, engineers, contractors and researchers, introducing green concepts, sustainable concrete solutions, products and technologies.
In doing so, the INSEE I&A Center identifies better ways to build superior, high performance and sustainable living structures and infrastructure in Sri Lanka, realizing the countrys vision of transforming into a sustainable ecosystem.
The company operated a stall at the exhibition, showcasing their brands as well as sustainable practices and applications.
INSEE Cements contribution to sustainable construction is twofold, said Janaka Weerakoon, Director Commercial at INSEE. One is to minimize environmental damage through optimization of process and product, and the second is through the dissemination of knowledge and information to a wider audience.
HarithaSihinaya 2017 proved to be one such platform where we could promote our brand, and reach out to a progressive demographic. We are proud to have been part of this exhibition as a Green Platinum Sponsor of the event.
The exhibition ended on a hugely successful note, attracting large crowds, including students from across the province. Having reached out to the general public during this edition of the exhibition,The North Western Provincial Council hopes to attract the participation of the commercial sector for the next exhibition, proposed for 2018.

Japan seeks balance with China in seas around Sri Lanka
COLOMBO -- Japan and Sri Lanka are celebrating 65 years of diplomatic relations this year, but their bilateral ties have rarely seemed more important -- especially in relation to maritime security in the Indian Ocean.
The two countries launched a dialogue on maritime security and other oceanic issues in January, following a 1.83 billion yen ($16.3 million) aid package from Japan in June 2016 designed to boost Sri Lanka's maritime security and crime-fighting capacity.
The Japanese embassy in Colombo said the dialogue was aimed at ensuring that the Indian Ocean remains open, stable and governed by the rule of law. The dialogue has become a wonderful step for developing such cooperation, the embassy told the Nikkei Asian Review.
But analysts say that Japanese strategy in the region is also spurred by worries about the expansive reach of China, which has become increasingly belligerent in maritime affairs. Abhijit Singh, head of maritime policy at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation, said Tokyo is certainly concerned about Beijing's growing investment in Sri Lanka and its influence over the government in Colombo.
The last thing Japan would like to see is a Chinese vassal state in the eastern Indian Ocean -- and that, too, so close to the critical sea-lanes, Singh said. It is gradually beginning to take greater interest in hard military security as well, [although] the military aid is presently rudimentary and not on a scale meant to attract undue attention.
For Sri Lanka, foreign assistance is welcome. Defense Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi said the island state's surrounding seas are 27 times larger than the country itself, so it needs whatever aid it can get to police the area. We require international support from countries such as Japan to secure and strengthen our maritime boundary, as well as strengthen our capabilities in search and rescue, he said in an interview.
People trafficking and drug smuggling are major problems for Sri Lanka, with many undocumented migrants traveling illegally by sea from the island to destination countries such as Australia. Since 2009, Sri Lankan police and the Australian authorities have intercepted 89 vessels transporting more than 4,500 migrants without visas, according to the Sri Lanka police.
Narcotics are also smuggled from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Latin America. In March 2016, drug dealers used fishing trawlers to transport a 101kg consignment of drugs into the country. Later in the year, purported "sugar" containers were seized with huge loads of cocaine from Brazil, according to the Police Narcotics Bureau.
Biggest donor
Apart from marine security, Japan has also been involved in socioeconomic projects in Sri Lanka, including infrastructure improvements and providing access to electricity and clean water. From 2013 to 2015, Japan granted a total of $143.5 million to Colombo for development-related projects. But China remains the biggest donor to Sri Lanka by far.
From 2005 to 2015, China provided $15 billion in official development assistance and foreign direct investment. Beijing also played a major role in providing military equipment to help Colombo fight the militant group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, bringing a quarter-century war to an end in 2009 with the killing of LTTE leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran.
After building a new port, airport and convention center in the city of Hambantota, China is now constructing the $1.4 billion Colombo International Financial City project, the largest foreign-funded investment in Sri Lanka. The offshore project is being built in an area larger than Monaco, and aims to attract more than $13 billion in FDI.
By comparison, $338.4 million in loans promised by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe when Sri Lanka's President Maithripala Sirisena visited Nagoya in 2015 is relatively small. The loans are expected to help finance the construction of transmission lines and water facilities in the North Central and Eastern provinces.
However, analysts say that a close relationship with Sri Lanka is essential to Japan. R. Hariharan, a retired military intelligence specialist who also served as the head of intelligence for an Indian peace-keeping force in Sri Lanka from 1987 to 1990, said the country's strategic location makes it an important element in Tokyo's efforts to protect maritime communication routes.
There is an increasing Chinese angle to Sri Lanka-Japan relations, and the maritime security and cooperation [element] has also become an important component of this relationship. Colombo is becoming a frequent destination for the goodwill visits of Japanese self-defense forces and this is also likely to grow in the coming years, Hariharan said.
Since 2009, more than 55 port calls in Colombo have been made by Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force and Japan Coast Guard ships.
The Japanese embassy said the Sri Lanka Coast Guard does not have sufficient patrol boats capable of open sea navigation. Those that do exist are deployed off the island's northern coasts, leaving southern and western regions exposed. Japan's 2016 aid package included two patrol vessels and financing for the construction of other vessels and training for coast guard crews.
These measures are expected to contribute to an improved capacity to provide prompt and appropriate marine rescues, prevent smuggling and other marine crimes, and to respond to oil spills from ships, the embassy said.
China is likely to remain Sri Lanka's principal donor, however. Rohan Samarajiva, founding chair of LIRNEasia, a Colombo-based Asian infrastructure policy and regulation think tank, said Colombo would take opportunities offered by China as part of its Belt and Road Initiative to consolidate its trading relationships and channels.
It is important for Sri Lanka to position itself to benefit from Chinese investments and loans, while balancing its traditional good relations with India and Japan, he said. If Sri Lanka does not welcome Chinese investments, they will flow to other locations.

Jumbo menace in East
Damage due to wild elephants' is on the rise in the Eastern Province. They are invading interior villages in search of food and water.
Earlier, elephants were entering the villages only during the night, but now, they are entering these villages even during the day. Officials have noticed that wild elephants have found their way into interior villages of the Ampara, Batticaloa, and Trincomalee districts.
Residents are in a state of fear. Last week, a house in the Iqbal Nagar 30 housing scheme at Thoppur, in the Trincomalee district, was destroyed by an elephant. Some villagers leave their villages to spend the night elsewhere.
People light and throw crackers to chase the wild elephants. Elephants had entered the premises of a farmer and caused damages to paddy bags stocked in his veranda, household goods, the parapet wall, etc.
Wild elephants also damaged standing paddy crops in fields, home gardens and other arable crops (highland crops). As a result, the daily income of the rural community has also been considerably reduced.
In order to chase these wild elephants out of the residential areas, villagers have resorted to setting fire to various parts of the village. Males stay on watch during the night whilst females stay on watch during the day.
As a result, the livelihood of the people is affected. These activities of wild elephants have considerably increased in the recent past, and parents complain that the education of their children are badly affected due to it.

Long-buried, yet unforgotten
Monerawila Keppetipola Disawa's name, fame and skull remain etched to this day. The skull in the memorial was erected to his memory in the outer courtyard of the Kandy esplanade on November 26, 1954.
On November 26, 1818, the people of Kandy witnessed the saddest scene, the execution of this great hero at Kandy Bogambara grounds. This punishment was the gift he was blessed with, for the first liberation he took part against the British which was held in 1818. This episode is known as the Uva Rebellion.
In 1818 Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe the last king of Sinhalay broke faith with the people and chieftains. This was the opportune time for the British, who had been waging an unsuccessful war to capture this land. Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe was arrested and sent to India where he passed off in 1832.
The Kandyan Convention was enacted on March 2, 1825, in the Magul Maduwa, Kandy. In terms of this convention, King Sri Wickrama Rajasinha was disposed of and the Sinhala Kingdom was entrusted to the King of England. Most signed the treaty in English and Tamil. Monarawila Keppetipola Disawa signed in Sinhala in a bid to prove that he was a good Sinhalese though he knew English. Like it or not, we were compelled to accept the King of England as our king.
Sri Wickrama Rajasinha was accompanied by William Granville to India. The Kandyan treaty was signed by Ehelapola Maha Adikaram, Molligoda Adikaram, Pilimatalawa Adikaram, Pilimatalawa Hathkorale Disawa, Monerawille  Uva Disawa, Ratwatta Disawa, Molligoda Thun Korale Disawa, Dullewa Walapane Disawa, Millewa Saman Kaduwe Disawa, Gallagama Disawa and Gallagoda Nuwakolaviya Disawa.
Kandyan Kingdom (Uva Wellassa)
Monarawila Keppetipola in 1818 was under the British service. During this time, the Kandyan Kingdom (Uva Wellassa) was supposed to be underdeveloped with full of fines on them. Discontent with this setup, they had requested to the Governor General Brownrigg to appoint one of their own people to look after their interests. The governor had responded to this request by appointing Haj Marrika as Muhandiram of Wellassa. This provocative and obnoxious new appointment was regarded as an act of insult to the Uda Rata people and chieftains. Discontentment and unrest began to brew within the Uva people.
At this stage in walked a Doraisamy a so called decent of the King Wickrama Rajasinha who did not lie low. He too began to form an incautious rebellion against the law of the British government. The Government then sent Haji Marrikkar of Wellassa to suppress the rebellion and more groups of rebels had pushed up, like mushrooms with the firm determination We will fight and make our country a free Sri Lanka once more.
Omnipotent Monarawila Keppetipola Disawa was sent by the British from Kandy to Uva to crush the rebels with a false picture that it was only a civil riot. Many houses had been burnt. Cattle houses and grain belonging to the Sinhala farmers had been forcibly burnt and destroyed. A reward had been offered for the arrest of Doraisamy. Kokumbare Rate Raja, a brainy leader of the rebellion, used his intelligence and brainwashed Monarawila Keppetipola Disawa and made clear that the latter had been enticed to handle an evil mission to crush his own Sinhala people. The Disawa was enlightened to truth and changed his mind. He returned the British arms. He felt it was nobler not to fight with their arms.
He was then taken to the place of execution to the bank of the Bogambara. Just before he was beheaded, he chanted a verse from the Dhammapada. The participants heard the last word, Thathagatha. Two blows severed his head. He instructed Eriyagama Kankanam where to strike the second blow.
After the beheading, his skull was sent to the London Medical University of Edinburgh for experiments. Different tests had been done in order to find out as to how he had got that inexplicable strength and willpower and fearlessness for death. We all fear death. But Monarawila Keppetipola Disawa did not fear death at all. It was the Duke of Gloucester who brought the skull to Kandy. Up to date we would have never been able to get it down to Ceylon had it not been for the tough fight given by Loku Banda Monarawila Keppetipola, his brother William Monarawila Keppetipola (fourth generation) and Upali M Keppitipola.
The Memorial Pillar is a reminder to us all of this. His skull was entombed on November 26, 1954. It is really a pity, instead of placing the skull at the museum, for the benefit of the public that it was buried deep in the rough sand. Really this should have been placed alongside with his other items, head dress, jacket, flag, which had been donated by one of his nephew Edman M Keppetipola of Unambuwa Wallawa of Gampola.
British camp
Monerawila, a beautiful village at Pallepola inside Matale, is situated just before reaching Wahakotte. This name Monerawille  Monera  (Peacock) Villa  (Water hole) had been named as peacocks had come to bathe, near a large bush where there had been this waterhole. Thus this village name Keppetipola was give to him by his mother along with Monerawila.
Monarawila Keppetipola had donated a land with a temple. Even today this temple stands well maintained with the deteriorated dingy shrine room where most paintings are invisible. The best is the old large attic on the verge of falling down at any moment leaving behind only its stone stands.
Matale has been a glossy historical name in Ceylon. Aluvihare, Keppetipola, Amunugama, Etipola, Galagoda Tibbatuwawa, Yattawatta, Hulangamuwa, Halangoda Weeragama, Giragama, Pussella, Wegodapola Tenne Maningamuwa are all based in Matale. All these families are connected. The most famous of these families was Monarawila Keppetipola.
After the Uwa Rebellion, the British had been after Monarawila Keppetipola and Madugalle. As Madugalle was ill, he had proceeded to Monarawila to Keppetipolas sister Kiriulla Kumarihamys cadjan-thatched house at Parahagama for a holiday. To go to this village you have to go to Kekirawa and proceed across Kalawewa along Galewala road and turn off from Adiyagala and then proceed about three kilometres and then you come to the destination which is Parahagama. Here stands a monument of the Disawa as it was from here that he was captured. As Madugalla was ill, he both spent a few days with Kiriulla Kumarihamy.
As there had been no signs of Madugallas recovery, Kiriulla Kumarihamy had arranged a Devil dancing performance by way of a healing ritual. During this period, Muslim traders used to come to dispose their goods and take away items that they do not possess. The traders detected Monarawila Keppetipola and Madugalla and reached the nearest British camp to betray them. Anyone who exposes Keppetipola and Madugalla was to be gifted with 2000 coins. The British camp was close to Kirulla Kumarihamys house. News was given to the chief commander Onil who immediately had gone to the place where ritual was held.
Monarawila Keppetipola introduced himself to Onil. He was taken to Bogambara on a dark, cloudy day of November 4, 1818. Here he was at the remand prison till the day of execution.

McDonnell falls short in world title twin ambition
KINGSTON UPON HULL, UK,| Sunday  Britain's Gavin McDonnell missed out on joining twin brother Jamie as a world champion after losing on points to Mexico's Rey Vargas for the vacant World Boxing Council super-bantamweight belt.
Had the previously undefeated McDonnell, 30, won he and Jamie, the World Boxing Association bantamweight champion, would have become the first British twins to both hold world titles simultaneously.
But although Saturday's fight took place in Hull, not far from McDonnell's base in Doncaster, northern England, there was no denying Vargas was a worthy winner after landing the better punches. McDonnell, however, was adamant he would bounce back from losing his maiden world title bout after going the distance with Vargas.
My feet were a little bit slow and I just couldn't pin him. I was a little bit too eager at times and credit to Rey, he beat me fair and square, McDonnell told Sky Sports.
I gave it everything and I just hope everyone enjoyed it. I feel as though I've let everybody down. The support's been fantastic, my first time topping the bill and I just fell short this time.
I've gone the distance there with a great fighter and I've shown I belong at the level, I just need to start tweaking things.
No doubt I'll be a world champion, it's just a few more fights to get another crack. AFP

The three RO plants were opened at Kusum Pokuna Pushparama Viharaya in Medirigiriya, Bodhirukkaramaya in Diyasenpura and Abhayawardhanaramaya in Abhayapuragama on Saturday by Justice and Buddasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.
Speaking on the occasion the minister commended the efforts of the Sri Lanka Navy and its initiative to open RO plants in areas where there is a high prevalence of the Kidney disease.The RO plant facility installed at Kusum Pokuna Pushparama Viharaya is capable of producing safe drinking water for 400 families in the area and 10 Buddhist monks at the temple.
The system at Bodhirukkaramaya can facilitate 420 families and eight monks in the temple with safe drinking water. Over 350 families in the area and six monks of Abhayawardhanaramaya too could get safe drinking water as a result of the latest installation of an RO plant at the temple premises.
The financial contribution for these RO systems was made by the Ministry whereas the compartments the systems are installed were constructed by the Navys Research and Development Unit.

New regional corporation to regulate southern development: Ranil
A special regional corporation to regulate and safeguard the development schemes of Southern Province should be established, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremsinghe said at Akmeemana, Galle on Saturday.
The Prime Minister was addressing the UNP Akmeemana Electorcal Central Organisation members meeting after opening the electoral office of Parliamentarian and UNP Chief Organiser Wijepala Hettiarachchi.
He said there was a regional development authority in the province and it was abolished. However, once again such an authority should be established to deal with development activities of the South. Chinese investors have already opted to initiate 100 new ventures in the South. Local investors will also get similar opportunities to set up their new industries in the province.
The Prime Minister added that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had trapped the country into a Rs. 482,940 million foreign debt burden which has to be settled before 2016.
Wickremesinghe said he was well aware that the former President could not manage the country anymore because he had steered the country into a serious debt trap by taking unending foreign and local credit. Therefore, they teamed up and ousted the Rajapaksa regime which had ruined the future of the country and that of the youth mortgaging the country to foreign lending agencies. Although they inherited a country which was a virtual hellhole with an unbearable debt burden, they knew how the country could be extricated from this plight, Prime Minister said
That was one reason why the government devoted 2016 to create financial stability in the country so that we could settle all those debts, the Prime Minister said.
He said the government also looked into the immediate peoples needs to ensure them a decent living. Therefore, the government provided economic relief by reducing the prices of essential goods. The price of petroleum and liquid petroleum gas was reduced. Salaries were increased all round. Despite difficulties, funds were also alleviated for village development.
The Hambantota port will be run as a joint partnership between the China Merchant Company and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. This will offset 80 percent of the debt owed to China on the Hambantota Port project. Arrangements should also be made to run the Mattala Airport as a joint venture. This would help develop the Mattala Airport and bring in one million tourists within the next five years, the Prime Minister said.
He said factories should be set up in the south to supplement this development programme. Now the government was identifying land from Hambantota, Moneragala, and Matara to set up the industrial zone. A southern corporation would be set up to provide regional land to investors. It is to get Chinese investors to open up at least 300 factories in the region, the Prime Minister said.
There would be an oil refinery a cement factory, a dockyard, power plant and a steel factory, he said.
Another plan was being mooted to develop the area from Deduwa in Akurala upto Koggala with foreign investment. If people desired to convert their old-fashioned houses into small tourist guest houses, arrangements would be made to provide instructions on the preparation of Western and Eastern cuisines to cater to tourists. For instance there was a chain of small tourist guest houses today around the Sinharaja forest. The government was now taking steps to introduce and develop information technology. A tourist zone would be set up in Wayamba, Industries in Kalutara and development plan was also envisaged for Kandy and Trincomalee. Polonnaruwa would be developed under the Pibidemu Polonnaruwa programme. Foreign investment on a massive scale is needed for these development schemes to take place, the Prime Minister said.
Although opponents were hell bent on trying to break up the consensus national government, it would continue nonchalantly till 2020 under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Paying a tribute to Akmeemana UNP organiser, Parliamentarian Wijepala Hettirachchi, the Prime Minister said he is a very active and energetic parliamentarian who worked round the clock to cater to the needs of his people and the progress of the party.
Ministers Vajira Abeywardena, and Gayantha Karunatilleke, Parliamentarians Wijepala Hettiarachchci, and Bandulal Bandaragoda spoke. Southern Provincial Council Opposition Leader Tennakoon Nilame was present.

Pacquiao to fight Britain's Khan in April
MANILA AFP Feb26, 2017:Philippine boxing hero Manny Pacquiao and British fighter Amir Khan confirmed separately on Sunday that they would face each other on April 23 after weeks of conflicting reports.
Pacquiao tweeted: Negotiations between team Pacquiao and team Khan have come to terms for the April 23 bout.
Khan, 30, a few minutes later posted on his official Twitter feed: My team and I have agreed terms with Manny Pacquiao and his team for a super fight.
Neither of them gave a venue for the match but a source in Pacquiao's office said the bout would be in the United Arab Emirates.
Pacquiao's American promoter, Bob Arum, has previously been quoted as saying on the ESPN that Manny is trying to get a fight done in the United Arab Emirates, and the people there favour him fighting Amir Khan.
Spokesmen for the World Boxing Organization welterweight champion Pacquiao could not immediately be contacted for comment.
Pacquiao, 38, previously confirmed on Twitter that he was in negotiations to face Khan despite Arum's own efforts to arrange a fight with Australian Jeff Horn in April.
Pacquiao tweeted on February 11: See you in UAE for my next fight.
He also posted a poll on his official Twitter feed asking his 110,000-plus followers to choose either Horn, Khan, American Terence Crawford or Briton Kell Brook as his next opponent.
Khan had been leading the poll when it was taken down. Pacquiao announced a brief retirement last year but made a successful comeback against Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas in November, saying he still felt like a youngster.
Pacquiao had said he was retiring to focus on his new role as Philippine senator, after winning elections last year on the back of his sporting fame. - AFP

## Title: For Patrick Modiano, the Past Is a Vexed Question
## Supertitle:

For Patrick Modiano, the Past Is a Vexed Question
Patrick Modianos novels gaze through the glass wall of our consciousness of history.
In a French TV show from 1990, the forty-five-year-old Patrick Modiano wanders around a supermarket on the rue de Svres in Paris. He speaks to himself and to the cameraman as he moves through the aisles of food, then pauses in front of a dairy case. Hes looking for traces of the Pax movie theater that once stood in the same spot, trying to recall where the screen was. But nothing he remembers is quite right, and his sentences break up in midcourse, leaving only verbal gestures at a past no longer visible. His attempt to locate the screen amounts to a fools errand.
Like the writer in this video, the characters in Modianos fiction fail in their search for a lost past. His heroes are elusive, disappearing into the crowd, more comfortable listening than speaking their mind, and always aware of the futility of the hunt: their prey is forever receding. In The Black Notebook, translated with perfect pitch by Mark Polizzotti, a writer named Jean tries to fathom the life of a former girlfriend, Dannie, a woman with multiple pseudonyms and a mysterious bond with gangsters who lived in the Unic Htel, in the shadows of the Montparnasse train station. During their affair, the police question him about the criminal activities of the group, but he has no information to give them. In a quintessential scene, Jean stands on the sidewalk of his imagination and stares at the men through the glass window of their hotel lobby.
One-way mirror
He gazes into an impenetrable story, not for its decor or its nostalgic atmosphere, but for the pull history exerts on the present: Perhaps the glass was opaque from inside, like a one-way mirror. Or else, very simply, dozens and dozens of years stood between us; they remained frozen in the past, in the middle of that hotel lobby, and we no longer lived, they and I, in the same space and time. Modianos books are full of moments like this; they transmit something deep and essential were forced to reckon with, the glass wall of our consciousness of history.
Modiano, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2014, likes to say that because he was born in 1945, he is a child of the war: Faced with the silence of our parents we worked it all out as if we had lived it ourselves. His father, Albert Modiano, was a man whose life was shrouded in moral ambiguities. Born in 1912 to a Sephardic family who came to France by way of Italy, Greece, and Egypt, he spent the war years hiding in Paris under a pseudonym and trading on the black market with unsavory colleagues.
Film-production
Despite several close calls and one arrest, Albert escaped the roundups of Jews that resulted in seventy-six thousand deportations. His son has spent a lifetime trying to fathom the combination of wit and accommodation that allowed his father to emerge from those years unscathed.
Modianos mother, Luisa Colpeyn, arrived in Paris during the occupation to work in the Nazi-administered Continental film-production company. After her children were born, she was often absent, on tour with a theater company or on a movie shoot. At first, Patrick and his brother Rudy were left in the care of their Flemish-speaking maternal grandmother. Later, they were sent from one unofficial foster home to another, in Biarritz, then in a suburb of Paris. They spent little time with either parent. Rudy died at age ten of leukemia, in 1957, leaving Patrick without a companion to face a lonely existence. By the sixties, his parents had divorced. When he wasnt at boarding school, home became his fathers place on the Quai de Conti, looking out over the Seinean apartment where, in his fictions, night-lit tourist boats cast shadows on the bedroom wall. At this address, one of the most glamorous in Paris, his estranged parents lived on separate floors, incommunicado. In Pedigree, his memoir, he explains that he grew up in splendid poverty. The settings were always luxurious, but there was never any money.
Of his two parents, Modianos mother may have done more for his literary career. We know from Pedigree that the novelist Jean Cau, Sartres one-time secretary, was an intimate friend of Luisa Colpeyn and brought Modianos eccentric first novel, La Place de lEtoile, to the attention of its publisher, ditions Gallimard.
The novelist and poet Raymond Queneau, another friend of his mother, tutored him in geometry. Queneau and Andr Malraux were witnesses at his wedding. Modianos success as a novelist was immediate and steady, a new novel every year or two and a series of prestigious prizes: the Roger Nimier Prize for his first novel in 1968; the Prix de lAcadmie Franaise in 1972; the Goncourt in 1978. He also composed songs for the pop-music star Franoise Hardy and coauthored the screenplay for Louis Malles classic film Lacombe, Lucien. He even wrote his mother a role in an episode of a TV series starring Simone Signoret. His mother seems to have shown him the way to a world of literature and entertainment, while his father introduced him to gangsters and shysters, an army of characters ready for fiction. In a cruel way, it was the perfect childhood for a writer.
For the French, the romance with Modiano has been a long, slow ride, unfolding over the course of some thirty novels. From the beginning, he has worked his own beat, obsessed with the mysterious world of his parents and indifferent to the experimental New Novels that were in fashion when he began his career.
Abandoned garages
His fiction portrays a very specific time, the thirty glorious years that marked the rapid French modernization and affluence, beginning with the Liberation in 1946 and continuing through 1968, the year Modiano entered the literary scene. Yet theres nothing obviously sociological about Modianos fiction. The detritus of prosperityabandoned garages, shuttered windows, condemned buildingsfills his stories. Each novel explores a different Paris neighborhood, granting individual streets their specific affect. In Dora Bruder, the poorest Jewish neighborhoods of the eighteenth district define the life of a girl about to be deported; in A Trace of Malice, a man who has lost his French identity wanders with the tourists around the Louvre and the rue de Rivoli; in La Place de lEtoile, Suspended Sentences, and Pedigree, the mere evocation of the rue Lauriston, once the headquarters of the French gestapo, is enough to signal Frances collaborationist past. Every shameful act, every unresolved event, better forgotten, finds its embodiment in a unique space.
Former colonies
The Black Notebook, too, is branded by environment. Dannie and her friends, much too old to be students, live first in the Moroccan and American pavilions at the Cit Universitaire.
These grand dormitories housed foreign students, including many who arrived in Paris from the former colonies. Later, Dannie decamps to the Unic Htel, another real place whose c instead of que marks its shabby modernity. When he tries to recall his walks with Dannie, Jean remembers streets with ghoulish names, like La Tombe Issoire where characters go to hide in the shadow of a railway station and a graveyard, and where, in his dreams, it is always raining.
On the surface, The Black Notebook resembles a police procedural, but its relationship to the past is more complex, since Jean is a literary dreamer whose time is never linear. The novel telescopes back to the mid-nineteenth century, settles temporarily in the 1960s, and flashes forward to Jean at his writing desk in contemporary Paris. Jean imagines he can escort one of the characters from the Unic Htel into the present, and wants to lend him a cell phone to help him out of a jam.
Dannie is at the center of the story, but he cant help wondering if his adventures with her were only a dream. The only proof is a black notebook he kept during their love affair, full of names, addresses, and phone numbers.

Paws everything for the Kattarshians
Some may say theres nothing good on the tube anymore. Thankfully, the good people of Iceland love cute and cuddly cats as much as we do.
An Icelandic news website has released a live, reality-style YouTube show featuring four, nine-week-old kittens living in a dollhouse stocked with bunk beds, toys and of course cameras.
The name of the show: Keeping Up With The Kattarshians.
Though the program is often a total snooze fest - its no secret that cats love to sleep - it should be heartening to know that its all for a good cause.
According to Iceland Magazine, the kittens - named Guni, Stubbur, Briet and Ronja - were moved into the house after they were found in an industrial park in Reykjavik with their mother. They were checked out by vets and Stubbur was found with an injured tail that required amputation.
Before moving into the house, the entire project, including the cat house, was reportedly reviewed and approved by the Icelandic Humane Society, as well as other animal welfare groups.
Now clean, healthy and well-pampered, the cats are using their good looks and charm not to push lip kits or emojis, but the adoption of other strays like them through Icelandic animal shelter, Kattavinaflagi - which roughly translates to the cat friendship society, according to Mashable. The kittens are also up for adoption themselves.

People-friendly global exposer
The combination of Sri Lankas geographical proximity and multifaceted ties with the Peoples Republic of China which spans over six decades of diplomatic relationship creates an unprecedented development opportunity. Sino-Lanka economic ties were given a major boost during President Xis visit to Colombo in July 2016 and the Chinese leader has become the first President to visit Sri Lanka since former leader Li Xiannian in 1986.
His visit assumes significance in the context of strengthening ties between the two countries, with China investing heavily in the island nation. This will inevitably generate new opportunities for Sri Lanka as well.
Very recently Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianling expressed the importance of the investment in Sri Lanka industrial Focused on Hambantota zone on the topic One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative. I already persuaded 10 CEOs of big companies to invest USD 3-5 billion in the next two to three years. Most of them belong to the 500 Fortune companies. I am confident that the corporation between Sri Lanka and China will be a success in the future, he said.
This poses the question as to what would be the most conducive framework for maximizing the benefits from the China. In this connection, it is very much in Sri Lankas interests to develop its economic relations with China with a Free trade Agreement. Sri Lanka  China FTA: The Jewel in the Crown, the FTAs with the two countries provide a useful framework for pursuing the maximization of the commercial benefits of bilateral relations with these two countries. These agreements should cover trade in goods and services; investment; trade facilitation; trade remedies; technological cooperation; tourism; and human resources.
One Belt One Road Initiative
There is enormous potential to increase tourism from China. The latter is already the largest source of tourists into Sri Lanka and Chinese arrivals are growing very rapidly. As tourism is the sixth pillar of the governments hub-based strategy, tourism promotion should be an important component of the partnership agreements with China. Human resources are likely to be the binding constraint holding back an ambitious vision based on the partnership agreements. In the long-term, education, training, and skills development should be better aligned with the countrys dynamic international comparative advantage.
China and its neighbouring countries are of the developing world and share geographical vicinity and common interests, and Chinese people and peoples from neighbouring countries have been enjoying a long-standing traditional friendship and fruitful cooperation. As I mention before the One Belt One Road Initiative offers a great opportunity for China and countries along the OBOR including Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Sri Lanka to deepen economic trade and cooperation, cultural and personnel communication and connectivity. However, the security risks could impact the implementation of the Initiative, and even the regional peace and stability at large. Meanwhile, the Chinese leadership and leaderships of all above-mentioned countries interacted frequently, which injected new impetus into the friendly bilateral relations. Importantly, people-to-people exchanges could serve as a cornerstone for bilateral relations between China and these countries. Therefore we need to strength contact, relationship and human interest of every citizens. The path is open. With the social media technology and lot of tourism activity speedily filling the gap. Government, Media, NGOs and peoples association could be the organise activity and develop the understanding of peoples capacity.
The Pathfinder Foundation in Colombo carried out a productive business and people friendly promotion mission to China with establishment the Eminent Persons Advisory Council comprising senior personalities from the both countries. This mission was organised at the invitation of the Chinese Peoples Association of Peace and Disarmament, a Beijing based think-tank with signing the Memorandum of Understanding in October 2013.
The council is set up technical sub-committees to realize the spirit of the MoU in such areas as strengthening economic, political, strategic and cultural relations. Given such a favourable background, the CPAPD is to be sponsor a NGO exchange programme first week of March this year.
International security
Pathfinder foundation, Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies and Institute of National Security studies will be participate this valuable forum with representative including Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Philippines for promoting exchanges, friendship and cooperation between Chinese people and peoples, thus making contributions to bilateral relations, regional peace, stability and common development. The theme of the programme is how to promote people-to-people bond within the OBOR and suggestions for Chinese NGOs to conduct more activities in foreign countries.
The joint delegation consists of various leaders of research institutes, think tanks, media and other social organisations, which is conducive to provide a comprehensive overview over the people-to-people exchanges and cooperation between China and its neighbours.
With the exchange event all six country represent the session call Wanshou Forum is an open platform for think tanks, NGOs and other relevant organisations to discuss hot topics of common concern. In this forum open Theme is to be: Current International Security Situation and Its Features. Shall the discussion cover the following aspects including the current international security situation and China should do for stabilizing or improving the international security situation In addition forum will focus whats the role for NGOs in this regard, Solutions or suggestions for international community to improve security situation.

## Title: In praise of readability

In praise of readability
To the writer who cannot suppress the ignoble sensation that it is not altogether unpleasant to have readers, Ben Roths entertaining little polemic against readability is something of a puzzle. In short, Roth fulminates against the term readable as a term of critical praise. It is (he says) now the pre-eminent adjective in the reviewers lexicon. He goes on to castigate readable books as commonplace, if not downright clichd; absent of abstraction, innovation or style; and altogether sans anything to stimulate the mind. Zadie Smith, Jonathan Franzen and Dave Eggers are among those thus chastised, for even a poor aim can take pot shots, if the pots are large enough. Readable books are (he says) false trophies, a statement sufficiently revealing as to require no further examination.
It would not, I think, be edifying to address any further the article itself. Rather, I write in praise of readability: of the skill such a quality demands, of its variance and of its benign and galvanizing effects.
First, prose which is readable may attain something of that quality famously praised by Orwell: that it is transparent, like a windowpane. The reader, spared the dense frost-fronds on the glass of triple-claused sentences and baroque obfuscations, peers instead directly at the objects beyond the window. Exemplars abound, not least of course in the works of Orwell himself; I have encountered it most recently and most deliciously in John Bergers A Country Doctor, the opening of which is spare to the point of emaciation:
One of them shouted down a warning, but it was too late. The leaves brushed him down almost delicately. The small branches encaged him. And then the tree and the whole hill crushed him together.
What is the effect of this Prose so readable as to almost vanish, leaving only a crushed man, a tree, a hill.
Second, fiction which is readable often promises, early on, thrills to which the reader is eager to return. Consider, for example, the opening of John Bunyans Pilgrims Progress (which also displays that first quality of a self-effacing simplicity of style):
As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain place where was a Den, and I laid me down in that place to sleep: and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream . . . I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back. I looked, and saw him open the book, and read therein; and, as he read, he wept, and trembled; and, not being able longer to contain, he brake out with a lamentable cry, saying, What shall I do
Third, prose which is readable is prose which is skilled. It is quite useless to argue that there is no objective standard for good and bad where writing is concerned; one need read hardly more than a dozen books before discovering that a bar is set. Readable prose is, generally speaking, diligent in its sentence construction, erring from received rules of grammar only deliberately and to a clear effect. Its figurative language functions so that the reader is not left puzzling over a metaphor which creaks like a well-oiled door (you see, I hope, what I did there); its characterization bears some resemblance to people as you and I know them; it is what one might call ontologically sound, creating a world entire from which it does not wilfully depart. Yet all these principles the skilful, readable book may wickedly flout, and still remain skilful and readable. Fourth, prose which is readable has little truck, if any, with the notion that the best works of literature lie beyond the ken of the general populace; and that this is indeed the measure of true quality. Rather, it is often benevolent, generous and humane; suspects that readers are creatures of intellect and query, and proceeds on that basis. William Tyndale, embarking on the translation of the Bible into English, famously retorted that he would see to it that even the ploughboy knew his Scripture better than any priest. 500 years on the King James Bible remains readable; for there, within the genealogies and archaisms, are great tracts of memorable cadences which convey  plainly and simply  complex and sublime ideas in a manner designed for the widest of readerships (Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil).
It is this fourth quality which is perhaps of greatest importance, for it is readable prose that changes the world. Foxes Book of Martyrs is readable  a riveting, gruesome, illustrated compendium of human courage and suffering  and it was central to the formation of the English consciousness. The Communist Manifesto is unabashedly readable, with its ringing declarations (All that is solid melts into air! All that is holy is profaned!), and series of robust, repetitive sentences. It might well be argued that Platos Socratic dialogues are an exercise in readability: abstractions as amiable conversation are rather more appealing than unbroken polemics.
Since the quality of readability is so varied, and so rich, works which may defy the standard on the one hand may fulfil it on the other. Bergers A Country Doctor is readable in the sense that it is elegantly plain; but it is also allusive and profound, requiring careful contemplation. Jane Eyre is readable in that it contains an orphan, a mystery, a fire, a madwoman; but the prose is in places trippingly dense and strange.
Maggie Nelson is readable, for her radiant intelligence and warmth are as irresistible as an open fire; but you could burn yourself on her sentences.
There is a line in The Republic which I think is the sum of all the above: that the quality of readability is not only not to be despised, but it is to be pursued. Socrates says, Come then, and let us pass a leisure hour in storytelling, and our story shall be the education of our heroes. Storytelling as leisure, as education and as a galvanizing force These are features of the readable, and I will never despise them.

Private sector has to open wallets, take risks and invest locally - CB Governor
Sri Lanka has put in place a framework for both fiscal and monitory management and it has now come to the implementations stage of these plans, said Governor Central Bank Indrajit Coomaraswamy.
Speaking at the 23rd annual awards ceremony of the Institute of Charted Ship Brokers, on Friday he said that there were very good plans ahead and the jury is very much out there to decide if they do it right or not. The big questions is can we deliver So in the next two to three years its going to be implementation and implementation.
Governor IndrajitCoomaraswamy
The Governor said that the private sector too has to play a major role in this process and they have to open their wallets, take risks and invest locally. Local investors has to recalibrate their risk appetite and take advantage of positive opportunities from the country.
The foreign investors too would look at the local investment patterns before they invest, the governor opined.
He said that for the country to go forward FDIs and also increase of exports were needed. Sri Lanka has failed very badly in the exports segment. Entrepreneurs must remember in the future companies cannot only manufacture for the local market and be content but must look at exports too. This applies to the service sector too, Dr Coomaraswamy asserted.
With several trade agreements to be inked this year with India, China, Singapore and also with the GSP Plus facility once again Sri Lankan exporters would have a market in the excess of 3 billion people.
He said that due to these agreements Sri Lanka would introduce and strictly implement anti-dumping laws to safe guard local industries. Commenting on the shipping sector he said that it too has a major role to play. Sri Lanka is located just 20 km of the worlds fastest growing economy, India and also in a prime location in the China Silk route.
The investment zone in the US 500 million plus investments at Hambantota Port by the Chinese too would open out opportunities to the shipping community.
He said that steps were taken to address the exchange rate problem and gradually it would be brought down. He said that the inflation too has been at a satisfactory single digit.
We will also introduce a flexible inflation target soon which would be very proactive. There will also be several other similar measures that would further improve the macro economic conditions, he added.

Raonic downs del Potro to book title clash with Sock
MIAMI AFP Feb26 :Top-seeded Canadian Milos Raonic held off Juan Martin del Potro 6-3, 7-6 (8/6) on Saturday to book a title clash with Jack Sock at the ATP Delray Beach Open.
Despite some shaky moments, Raonic fought off a set point in the second-set tiebreaker and closed out the match with his 17th ace of the night to advance to the meeting with Sock, a 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) winner over fellow American Donald Young. You know it's going to be close, so it's about keeping disciplined and a positive attitude on the court, Raonic said.
World number four Raonic, forced out of the Davis Cup this month with a thigh injury he suffered during the Australian Open, broke del Potro in the 11th game of the second set to serve for the match.
But the big-serving 26-year-old was broken back, firing a forehand wide to give del Potro a break point which the 2009 US Open winner converted with a backhand winner.
Raonic was close again with a 5-4 lead in the tiebreaker and two service points to come.
But he double-faulted and sent a forehand wide to give del Potro a set point that the seventh seed couldn't convert.
Another forehand long from del Potro gave Raonic a 7-6 lead and the Canadian won a third straight point to reach his first final of 2017.
He was coming so fast to my game and slice that I couldn't manage my backhands, del Potro said. I tried my best, but he was too good. Sock will be seeking to add a second title of the year to the one he lifted in Auckland in January.
He saved the only break point he faced in the match and won the last seven points of the second-set tiebreaker to seize the victory.
Sock said his storming finish belied the challenge posed by Young.
It definitely could have gone either way in the first set, Sock said.
He's a tricky player in that he makes you play a lot of balls and can wear you down, but also has great hands at the net when he comes forward. - AFP

Rationalism towards the solution
In the 1980s, the North Colombo Medical College (NCMC) caused a firestorm of controversy when they pushed to set up the first private medical college in Sri Lanka. Its founder, Dr. G M Heennilame, had been advocating for the idea since 1975 but in the 80s, with the support of the late President, J. R. Jayewardena, and the College of General Practitioners of Sri Lanka, he was finally able to make it a reality.
The concept of free education has always been a sacred cow in the Sri Lankan polity and while it has worked for the betterment of many in the country, at times it has also been used as a political tool to arouse the sentiments of the masses.
The NCMC after just eight years of operation and producing 800 graduates was finally taken over by the State in a bid to quell rising opposition to it and transformed it into the Medical Faculty of the University of Kelaniya. Today what we witnessed at that time pro and against NCMC is repeated in the issue of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) - the story is the same though the actors have aged.
The crux of the question here is whether it is a priority of the state alone to provide medical education. If not, can private institutes of higher education be allowed to step in If the answer to the latter is yes, the question is, under what conditions should they be allowed to function
Government Medical Officers Association Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soysa
It is not a must that the government should privatise medical education. But they need to conduct a survey and study whether we truly have a shortage of doctors and if so, what is the best possible way to provide medical education. The government must have proper policy in this regard.
It would be better for the government to provide medical education as their capacity is much better than the private sector. When many speak of students being deprived of an education, they are talking of students who get three simple passes at their A/Ls. Do we really need them to be doing medicine For a solution to the district quota problem, we can change the ratio between the district quota to merit quota to 50:50 from the current 60:40. The government can decide whether private medical institutes should come in but minimum standards of them should be maintained.

University Grants Commission Chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva
According to the minister, the governments policy is to engage in public-private partnerships to guarantee the quality of public and private education. As UGC Chairman, I concentrate only on state higher education.
After having analysed the quality of both state and private higher education for many years, the UGC felt that there is a need for an independent quality assurance mechanism for higher education. The State Minister with Higher Education Minister started a process to initiate quality assurance in higher education. We have developed a comprehensive policy document on this subject after having met with a legal draftsman at least seven times. We will soon submit our findings and policy document to the Cabinet.We are training a set of quality assurance officers, and we have more than 160 so far.But when it comes to obtaining professional degrees, like those in medicine or engineering, Sri Lanka should make sure that the universities, whether public or private, have proper quality assurance accreditation when granting degrees. Furthermore, the universities must have a certificate of compliance from professional organisations dealing with these matters. In future, if new medical faculties come to Sri Lanka, we must provide new systems that determine degree-granting status. An independent committee should recommend the degree granting status to the Higher Education Minister, and the faculties should also acquire a certificate of compliance.
Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella
As a policy, the United National Party (UNP) accepts private education. We will not destroy the free education system that we commenced. But today you find private universities around the world working hand in hand along with state universities. This is because the state cannot keep opening universities to meet the requirements of every student who qualifies to enter higher education. In Sri Lanka, less than 20 percent enter university, 80 percent is left out - so what is the solution
Due to the quota system, those with lower marks can enter high education while those with higher marks are left out. If we have an island-wide merit system, it will be different. These people are asking the government to help them. Those who can afford, can go abroad; the rest are stuck here. The students at the SAITM informed me that they are willing to sit for a final licensing exam set by the Medical Council.
I agree, however, the standards of education should be maintained even if private institutes are allowed to function. We will table a bill in Parliament called the Quality Assurance Bill very soon - its an effort to guarantee and uplift the quality of university education not only in state universities but also in private higher education institutes. The effort has been supported by the World Bank. The state alone cannot provide higher education; if that was possible, it would have done it long ago. Our annual income is just sufficient to cover debts.
Our election manifesto clearly stated that we will encourage private universities. Now the GMOA also has come to the middle ground and said they are not against private institutes as long as standards are maintained - we also agree with that stand. When it comes to private medical colleges, if investors come, it can be done. They can also link up to government hospitals to provide adequate clinical training and even help improve those hospitals.*
Professor of Urology, Department of Urology and Renal transplantation, National Teaching Hospital, Neville Perera
The state cannot provide medical education for all qualified students. Many students receive the required A/L scores; but state universities can afford only about 1000 leading to a shortage of doctors, and the country is in need of 4,000 more to achieve the recommended doctor to patient ratio.
We are below many developing countries in this measurement. Many talented go to other countries for their medical training; and some of them stay and practise overseas. Having private medical schools will make more people stay and study here. I think private medical universities should have admissions criteria on par with those of state schools. Currently, state medical faculties have higher admissions standards.
Also, an independent institution or group run by the UGC or the Higher Education Ministry should be set up to monitor both public and private medical faculties. Even state medical faculties sometimes do not meet the required standards. We should work on to bring everyone up to the same standards.
Joint Opposition Higher Education Shadow Minister Shehan Semasinghe
Providing medical education is one of the priorities of the government. With any field of education, the government should take the main role and the system should be built around that. If the government cannot cope with the demand, the private sector can be brought in to fill the gap; but they have to be properly standardised.
Just because we are hungry, we are not going to eat any rubbish. Just because we need private education, we cannot allow everyone to set up. We are not against private universities, but they all need to be standardised.
The independent regulating bodies that standardise them should not be disabled. The government cannot override them to establish private universities. If these authorities approve private institutes, then problems will not arise.
It does not matter what the previous government did; this government should not repeat them.
National Dangerous Drug Control Board Chairman Dr. Ravindra Fernando
At present, many private institutions provide higher education in Law, Biomedical Sciences, Business and Management among others. No one protests against them. All political parties have accepted them. I do not see why only the state should provide medical education. Proper standards should be maintained by private institutions when they provide any higher education, including medical education. The Sri Lanka Medical Council should have the authority like in all other countries to monitor medical education.
Department of Medicine Head, University of Kelaniya Prof. Arjuna Silva
The solution is what the Deans have proposed. One way forward is to have a private-government partnership providing fee levying medical education, so that the standards are protected. This will save a lot of money going overseas. The profit can then be used to help improve hostel facilities in state medical institutions. This is a hybrid model.
South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Founder and Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando
At present, medical education seems the priority of the state. A private medical institute has to obtain degree awarding status by submitting an application to the Higher Education Ministry in this regard, according to the University Act No. 16 of 1978. The Ministry appoints several review committees to evaluate the entire procedure. In our case, we got a Program Review Committee, Institutional Review Committee, and a Subject Review Committee to evaluate our standards before granting us the degree awarding status. Private degree awarding institutes are under the purview of "Specified Authority". In this case, it is the Secretary to the Higher Education Ministry.

The Bourse ended on a mixed note this week as the ASPI decreased by 21.73 points (or 0.35%) to close at 6,138.14 points, while the S&P SL20 Index increased by 9.48 points (or 0.27%) to close at 3,553.11 points.
Turnover & market capitalization
Dunamis Capital was the highest contributor to the weeks turnover value, contributing LKR 0.26Bn or 14.14% of total turnover value.
Commercial Bank followed suit, accounting for 10.75% of turnover (value of LKR 0.20Bn) while Cargills contributed LKR 0.18Bn to account for 9.74% of the weeks turnover.
Total turnover value amounted to LKR 1.87Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR 3.17Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR 0.47Bn (-26.39% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 0.63Bn.
Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased by 0.57% W-o-W (or LKR 15.61Bn) to LKR 2,700.05Bn cf. LKR 2,715.66Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Diversified Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 27.29% (or LKR 0.51Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by Dunamis Capital, JKH & Hemas Holdings which accounted for 93.44% of the sectors total turnover.
The Banking, Finance & Insurance Sector meanwhile accounted for 25.82% (or LKR 0.48Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by Commercial Bank, HNB & Seylan Bank[NV] which accounted for 63.86% sector turnover.
The Beverage, Food & Tobacco Sector was also amongst the top sectoral contributors, contributing 17.51% (or LKR 0.32Bn) to the market.
The sector turnover was driven by Cargills which accounted for 56.77% of the sector turnover.
Liquidity (in volume terms)
The Diversified Sector dominated the market in terms of share volume too, accounting for 23.82% (or 18.08Mn shares) of total volume, with a value contribution of LKR 0.51Bn.
The Banking, Finance & Insurance sector followed suit, adding 17.21% to total turnover volume as 12.99Mn shares were exchanged.
The sectors volume accounted for LKR 0.48Bn of total market turnover value. The Plantations Sector meanwhile, contributed 9.47Mn shares (or 12.47%), amounting to LKR 0.10Bn.
Top gainers & losers
Harischandra Mills was the weeks highest price gainer; increasing 20.67% W-o-W from LKR 2,400.20 to LKR 2,896.40.
Kelsey Development gained 18.25% W-o-W to close at LKR 49.90 while Lucky Lanka gained 11.54% W-o-W to close at LKR 2.90. Pan Asia Bank (+11.11% W-o-W) and Horana Plantations (+11.11% W-o-W) were also amongst the gainers.
SMB Leasing[NV] was the weeks highest price loser, declining 33.33% W-o-W to close at LKR 0.20. Shalimar (-24.87% W-o-W), Ceylon Printers (-22.72% W-o-W) and Blue Diamonds[NV] (-20.00% W-o-W) were also amongst the top losers over the week.
Foreign investors closed the week in a net buying position with total net inflows amounting to LKR 0.10Bn relative to last weeks total net inflow of LKR 0.47Bn (-78.03% W-o-W).

In terms of volume, Asia Asset and Sierra Cables led foreign purchases while Cargills & Renuka Agri led foreign sales.
In terms of value, Hemas Holdings & JKH led foreign purchases while Cargills & HNB led foreign sales.
Point of view
Equities reversed last weeks uptrend, with the benchmark ASPI hitting a 7-day low on Tuesday before recovering slightly to close the week ~ 22 points lower than last week.
The ASPI which hit 6127.49 on Tuesday was able to pare-down some of its losses on Wednesday and Thursday as it recovered by ~11 points largely due to positive earnings reported by financial institutions.
Average turnover levels meanwhile, hovered around LKR 0.47Bn during the holiday shortened week (26% decline W-o-W) as retail activity in particular, remained muted with investors remaining on the sidelines.
Large parcels in Dunamis Capital (32% of the total crossings), Commercial Bank (18% of the total crossings), Cargills (11% of the total crossings) helped extend the HNI and Institutional contribution to turnover, and total crossings for the week accounted for ~44% of total market turnover.
Foreign investors meanwhile, continued to remain net buyers for the 4th consecutive week, although net inflows declined by 78% W-o-W to LKR 0.11Bn.
The continuous net buying since the start of February has helped ease-off net outflows from equities in January; the YTD net foreign position was consequently an outflow of LKR 0.14Bn (cf. an outflow of LKR 1.66Bn recorded in Jan17).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current momentum.
Fitch outlook change positive for potential ISB
Fitch Ratings Revision in its outlook for Sri Lanka (to Stable from Negative) is positive in light of the fact that the country hopes to tap international markets with a $1.5Bn sovereign bond later this year.
The revised outlook should help restrain some of the risk premia attached to the proposed sovereign debt.
Despite Fitchs rating s downgrade (to B+ from BB-) and negative outlook on Sri Lanka last February, the country successfully raised a $1.5Bn Dual-tranche ISB in July 2016 within the price guidance of 6.125% and 7.125%, as global financial markets recovered from the high volatility (and EM capital outflows) immediately following BREXIT.
Continued net inflows to EM assets since the US presidential elections coupled with the revised ratings outlook for Sri Lanka could therefore, aid the country in raising the new ISB at potentially lower risk premiums.
However, some upside to the risk premium attached to the sovereign debt is possible in light of the fact that risk appetite for EM assets may wane (due to the USs trade and monetary policies) along with Sri Lankas continued weak external liquidity position. If the GoSL can successfully raise the sovereign bond though, the fund inflows should help bolster the countrys declining FX reserves ($5.5Bn in Jan17 vs. $6.0Bn in Dec16) and ease some near-term pressure on the LKR and domestic interest rates.

Rs. 80 billion spent annually on imported agro chemicals: Rajitha
Sri Lanka spends Rs. 80 billion annually to import agro chemicals, The country can minimise this by cultivating organic fruits and vegetables and exporting them to Europe, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne added that some political parties brought farmers to the streets demanding artificial agro chemicals, but today farmers do not ask for them.
According to the minister, 5,000 acres are being cultivated now without using poisonous agro chemicals.
The previous Government imported cheap, agro chemicals and distributed them.
It destroyed fertile farming lands. The minister was addressing the gathering after the harvesting ceremony at the Bopitiya village, Yatadolawatta, Kalutara recently.
Now they cultivate organic fruits and vegetables without using poisonous agro chemicals imported from foreign countries. "When the tax on tobacco increased up to 90 percent, the tobacco company said 35,000 farmers will lose their livelihood, but it did not happen," the minister said.
"The WHO informed me that Sri Lanka can join the five countries with the best health services if we continue with the current projects and programmes. The queue for eye surgeries has grown long due to the availability of free eye lenses and this queue will be reduced within the next six months," the minister said.

Scotland and Ireland stay alive
DUBLIN, Saturday  Scotland ended a decade of Welsh hurt and an Ireland side inspired by Johnny Sexton beat France as they each kept their Six Nations title hopes alive on Saturday.
The Scots 29-13 success at Murrayfield saw them come from 13-9 down at half-time and end a run of nine successive defeats by Wales, with Vern Cotter's men scoring 20 unanswered points after the break.
Second-half tries from wings Tommy Seymour and Tim Visser saw Scotland pull clear, with fly-half Finn Russell landing all seven of his goal-kicks for a 19-point haul in place of injured first-choice kicker and captain Greig Laidlaw.
Table-toppers Ireland's 19-9 win over France may have been less spectacular, featuring just the one try from scrum-half Conor Murray, but the match saw fit-again Ireland fly-half Sexton mark his return from injury with an 11-point salvo.
With reigning champions England the only side to have won their opening two fixtures and hosting a fragile Italy at Twickenham on Sunday, the other four sides in the tournament knew they had to win on Saturday to stay alive, in the words of Ireland coach Joe Schmidt.

SL-Pakistan bonds strengthen
Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Major General (R) Jayanath Lokuketagodage highlighted the cordial and warm relations between Sri Lanka and Pakistan during Sri Lankas 69th Independence celebrations in Islamabad, Pakistan, recently.
He said the unity government is working hard to ensure good governance, transparency, accountability and the promotion of pluralism.
He said the political, trade and economic relations between Pakistan and Sri Lanka are solid and longstanding. Pakistan is the second largest trading partner of Sri Lanka in the SAARC region. Sri Lanka was the first country to sign a Free Trade Agreement with Pakistan. A substantial growth is seen in bilateral trade, particularly after the implementation of the PakistanSri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (PSFTA) in 2005.
The value of total trade between the two countries has increased from US $ 158 million in 2005 to over US $ 337 million (up to November) in 2016. The balance of trade (BOT) has always been in favor of Pakistan and the trade gap has increased at a considerable rate over the years. Pakistan and Sri Lanka are determined to boost the bilateral trade to reach at US$ 1 billion mark. Therefore, authorities of both the countries are regularly monitoring, reviewing and addressing issues that are being encountered by the business community in order to further strengthen the existing trade and economic relations between Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
The celebration began with the hoisting of the National Flag by the High Commissioner. Following the lightning of the oil lamp by the dignitaries, two minutes silence was observed for the National War Heroes as a mark of respect for their sacrifices for peace, independence and sovereignty of the motherland. This was followed by religious observances performed by members of the clergy representing Buddhist, Hindu, Christianity and Islam religions. The special messages of the President, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister were read out on the occasion.
Visitors were served with Sri Lankan tea and traditional kavum, kiribath and other Lankan sweetmeats.On the evening of February 6, a formal reception was held with a special cultural show presented by a group of 14 members from the Sri Lanka Navy dance troupe. A gathering of 500 people comprising over 200 diplomats, ministers and dignitaries of Pakistan, and Sri Lankans living in Pakistan participated.

Sri Lanka slams lawyers over Snowden refugee claims
COLOMBO: Sri Lankan police Sunday formally denied hunting nationals who sheltered fugitive whistleblower Edward Snowden in Hong Kong and said their claims to the contrary could have been made to bolster asylum applications.
Police said they had no interest in the two Sri Lankan men, both asylum-seekers, who in 2013 had helped the former US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor evade authorities in Hong Kong.
Snowdens Sri Lankan former hosts, Supun Thilina Kellapatha and ex-soldier Ajith Pushpakumara, told reporters in Hong Kong on Thursday that they were scared and nervous about Sri Lankan police agents activities allegedly targeting them in Hong Kong.
We confirm these allegations are frivolous, unfounded and baseless, Sri Lankan police said in a statement. It said only one Sri Lankan police officer had traveled to Hong Kong last year, between November and December for five days to attend Interpol training on cybercrime.
The statement did not name the attorneys for the two Sri Lankan asylum-seekers, but said it had come across instances of lawyers making false allegations against law enforcement to strengthen their clients asylum claims.
We have come across lawyers representing asylum seekers who are in the habit of making utter false allegations against officers... with the ulterior motive of supporting (asylum) claims of their clients, the statement said.
Accompanying the asylum-seekers on Thursday, their lawyer Robert Tibbo and pro-democracy lawmakers James To and Charles Mok said they believed Sri Lankan police agents had targeted the pair.

Sri Lankan doctor charged with manslaughter of abusive husband freed
A Sri Lankan-born doctor convicted of the manslaughter of her abusive husband last year has been granted parole and will be released from prison this week.
Chamari Liyanage was jailed for four years in February last year over the fatal bashing of her manipulative and merciless husband Dinendra Athukorala in Geraldton in 2014.
She has been eligible for parole since June but was facing deportation upon release after her permanent residency visa was automatically cancelled on character grounds.
Liyanages visa was reinstated after her friends in the Geraldton community campaigned to convince the Immigration Department to review the mandatory cancellation.
Her parole was approved by the Prisoners Review Board this afternoon and she is set to be released from Greenough Regional Prison on Wednesday.
Liyanages lawyer George Giudice said she was elated with the result and could not wait to be released into the Geraldton community.
I am looking forward to seeing her walk through the front door of my office on Wednesday, he said.
She has been a model prisoner and has been helping other women in jail.
She is very well regarded out there in Greenough prison. She has been pursuing her art and has been a great confidant to other women.
During Liyanages murder trial, the jury was told Dr. Athukorala engaged in unusual sexual practices, forced his wife to take part in threesomes and controlled her movements and finances.
After years of physical, sexual and emotional abuse, Liyanage bashed her husband over the head with a 1.79kg mallet as he lay in bed at their Geraldton home.
Liyanage has been studying and writing a book in prison in the hope of using her experience to help other victims of domestic violence.
Giudice said she wanted to raise awareness about women who were stuck in situations where they were controlled.
Liyanage was acquitted of murder after a three-week trial but was found guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter.
She is waiting on the result of an appeal against her manslaughter conviction.

Sri Lankan student at Bangor University faces deportation
A Bangor University student could be deported to Sri Lanka just three months before completing her Electrical Engineering degree.
Shiromini Satgunaraja, who is predicted to graduate with a First Class Honours, has been refused asylum. NUS Wales explained that Shiromini first arrived in the United Kingdom in 2011.
She and her mother were granted discretionary leave to remain while she completed her GCSEs after her father passed away.
Further leave to remain was then granted on appeal which enabled Shiromini to complete her A/Levels and start a university course. When that expired, further grants of leave to remain and of asylum were denied, but Shiromini has been allowed to remain in the United Kingdom to continue her university course while appealing.
A member of the family explained that the mother and daughter were arrested shortly after their visa applications were rejected.
They got arrested on February 21 because their visas were rejected, the family member explained.They were at the police station until roughly 6pm on Thursday. They then got taken to Yarlswood Detention Centre.
We dont know how what will happen next, but I know flights have been booked for them to go back to Sri Lanka at 9pm on February 28. But their family are concerned they will not settle in Sri Lanka. She was studying her third year at university and she was progressing well, the family member added.
She achieved 82 percent last semester and was expected to achieve a first in her degree. She doesnt really know anything about Sri Lanka. They could at least let her stay to finish her degree, otherwise her two years of studying will go wasted. Her dad was a maths teacher so shes always been very interested in learning. NUS Wales Deputy President, Carmen Smith, and Undeb Bangor Students Union Vice President Education and Welfare Helen Marchant have written to the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd MP, to request that she use her discretionary power to stop the deportation. in their letter," he said.
Smith and Marchant said: We remind you, Home Secretary, that Shiromini has lived in and contributed to the United Kingdom since 2011, yet she is still only 20 years old. It is our belief that it would be particularly callous to remove her to a country where she has no social or cultural ties, at an age where it is generally accepted that if she were a British national, she would still be able to live at home with her mother.
We also remind you of the value that Shiromini can bring to her local community and to the United Kingdom. We know that the United Kingdom is experiencing a concerning skills gap in STEM subjects. As Home Secretary, you have the power to intervene. We request that you act urgently over the weekend to stop the deportation of Shiromini and her mother.
Hywel Williams MP added that Sri Lanka is still a very dangerous place and Shiromini has had no real ties with the country since she was a child. Her imminent deportation is not only unjust and unfair but will deprive Wales and indeed the UK economy of the contribution she will make. She would be an asset to this country at a time when we may be facing severe shortages of highly-skilled and educated specialists. This makes no humanitarian sense and no sense at all in terms of the business needs of our country.
A Home Office spokesman said it does not routinely comment on individual cases, but he also said the UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who genuinely need it.
The Home Office assured that every case is carefully considered on its individual merits, and refuge is granted where people establish a genuine need for protection or a well founded fear of persecution.
Shirominis family have now set up a campaign on social media to fight for her right to stay in the UK.

Suspicious fund transfer from Prabhas account to a womans account here
The mystery surrounding the murder of Prabha Arun Kumar, a software engineer from Bengaluru stabbed to death in Sydney in March 2015, has deepened, with Australian investigators revealing a suspicious transfer of funds to a womans account in Sri Lanka from Prabhas compensation amount.
The murder is being investigated by a special detective squad, Strike Force Marcoala of New South Wales, Australia.
After Prabhas death, Rs 1 crore, which included the Australian governments compensation and benefits from life insurance, was deposited into her account.<U+2008>The husband is the legal nominee to receive compensation, CID sources said. The money was transferred to a womans account in Sri Lanka in 2015-16. NWS detectives visited Bengaluru in January and verified details of the accounts of Prabha, her husband Arun Kumar and family members. The suspicious transfer of funds to Sri Lanka came to light during the verification.
The detectives interrogated Prabhas relatives and Kumar over the transfer of funds.
The sleuths were told that the woman, a teacher from Bengaluru, was Prabhas family friend and was undergoing a financial crisis. Hence, the funds were transferred to her account from Prabhas account. The woman was in Sri Lanka on an official assignment in 2015-16 and had opened an account there. She was a close friend of the man who transferred the funds.
The woman made a statement to Australian investigators that she received the funds as loan to overcome a financial crisis.
The investigators did not find any convincing evidence to establish a link between the suspicious transfer of funds and Prabhas murder, sources said. An unidentified man had followed her and slit her throat on March 7, 2015, while she was passing through a Sydney park about 300 metres away from her house, minutes after she got down from a tram.
The CCTV in the park had captured the image of the assailant. The sleuths had detained over 30 men involved in crimes in Sydney who resembled the assailant. However, it later emerged that they didnt have any role in that murder. The sleuths had also interrogated a 27-year-old man who had stabbed two women in the park earlier. However, the investigation established that he was not involved in Prabhas case.
A native of Nandagokula in Amtoor near Kalladka in Bantwal taluk, Prabha had moved to Bengaluru in 1998. She was sent to Australia for a project for a year by her employer Mindtree in 2012. (Deccan Herald)

The capacity expansion ongoing in India is the largest the group as ever undertaken, and with GSP round the corner, we are gearing for the next wave of growth. Chairman of CSE, Vajira Kulatilaka congratulated Teejay on the companys rise and stated that both the exchange and investors alike have benefited by the presence of an emerging player in the manufacturing sector in the market.

Truck plows into Mardi Gras parade, 28 injured
US: A suspected drunk driver plowed a pickup truck into a Mardi Gras parade Saturday in New Orleans, leaving 28 people injured, including children, officials said.
At this time it appears that its a subject who was highly intoxicated, who struck a number of vehicles and then veered off hitting a whole bunch of innocent people, New Orleans Police Chief Michael Harrison told reporters.
Seven of those injured declined to go to the hospital, an official at the press conference said. The age of the victims ranged from an approximately three- to four-year old child who was in stable condition, to people in their 30s or 40s, he added.
According to Harrison the vehicle driver is under investigation for drunk driving and of course hitting all the people who were injured. The driver plowed into the crowd just before 7:00 pm (0100 GMT Sunday) as spectators watched the Krewe of Endymion parade, which is part of the citys famous Mardi Gras celebrations. New Orleans Krewes are the private organizations that lead parades and throw balls during the citys Carnival season.
Its very hard to protect against somebody thats very intoxicated that runs through a crowd, Mayor Mitch Landrieu told reporters, adding that barricades had been put in place. People have to be responsible and they have to be thoughtful about what they do, he said.
Earlier in the day a man was wounded after a gun went off near the Krewe of Tucks parade elsewhere in town. Police believe the weapon was accidentally discharged inside a portable toilet, according to The Times-Picayune newspaper. In both instances our officers were on the scene within seconds if not minutes, Landrieu said.- AFP

One group was in favour of the dog care centre while the other, whose demonstration was bigger in numbers that included the Maha Sangha, was against the centre.
The bone of contention was the seizing of a collection of chains and bracelets with symbols depicting the head of the Buddha from the dog care centre at Metaramba, Unawatuna by the Habaraduwa Police recently. The dog care centre is maintained by a German expatriate.
Those participating in the two demonstrations dispersed after the Maha Sangha addressed them and pledged to get the dog care centre removed from the area before the next full moon Poya Day.

Umavi Pathirana presents research at second APCCR forum in KL
Umavi Pathirana recently presented a research paper on Simplifying Legal Statements using Natural Language Processing at the second Asia Pacific Conference on Contemporary Research (APCCR) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Pathirana, a recent graduate of the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology, is employed at the London Stock Exchange Groups new facility at Trace Expert City, where she works with some of Sri Lankas best and brightest technology professionals in providing support to the Groups worldwide network.
Utilising a computational approach to reduce the complexity of a legal statement, Pathiranas research delved into information extraction, information retrieval, question analysis and answer generation techniques as methods to derive better meanings for legal statements. Positing that, if legal statements are analysed as questions, more information could be retrieved from the WordNet and LawNet networks via a process that mostly functions like a search engine. Research results showed an accuracy level of 80% on average, for a 1,500-item data-set.
Held under the theme, Breakthrough to Excellence, the second Asia Pacific Conference on Contemporary Research highlighted up-to-date academic research being carried out in the disciplines of Business, Social Sciences, Education, and Information and Communications Technology (ICT).
It featured internationally recognised scholars presenting their latest research and best practices.

Unstoppable Kandy wins Clifford Cup for record 21st time
Unstoppable Kandy Sports Club proved why they are the top Sri Lankan rugby club when they overwhelmed Havelock Sports Club by 32 points (3 goals, 1 try, 1 drop goal, 1 penalty) to 20 (1 goal. 2 tries. 1 penalty) in the final to retain the Clifford Cup and win it for a record 21st time at the Nittawela yesterday. At half time Kandy led 24-3.
This win follows their victory in the Dialog league championship which gives them the double for the season.
The final was played under wet conditions as suddenly at 3 pm the rain came down heavily and the ground was made soggy. However with the kick-off the rain ceased.
The final was all about attitude and Kandy knew how to work through it. The team was in superb physical condition and they were a level above the opponents. Kandy showed better teamwork than the losers and their defence was really difficult for the Park Club to make any progress.
Kandy was brilliant yesterday. Be it a forward loose maul or three-quarter move, they were there on the ball like a cat pouncing on a mouse. Whenever or wherever the ball was they were swiftly onto it. They stuck to their guns and certainly stamped their class.
The Park club players not to be outdone played the game of their lives. They played like a pack of tigers. Their forwards deserve a big bouquet but their threes had little chance against the fleet-footed Kandy backs.
The attitude of the Havelock's players was good and they fought it out for the entire game.
Havelock's were determined to stage a better performance and with the kick-off for the first 10 minutes or so they piled enormous pressure on Kandy SC. Sean Wijesinghe had told the players not to give away penalties and concentrate on the set scrums and line outs to give back a 90-95% performance. In the first half Kandy gave away far too many penalties but fortunately Havelock's couldn't capitalize on that.
For Kandy SC Gayan Weeraratne (2), Fazil Marija (1) and Richard Dharmapala (1) scored the tries.
Thilina Wijesinghe scored a brilliant drop goal and also made four conversions that included a penalty. For Havelock SC Nishon Perera (2) and skipper Dushmantha Priyadarshana (1) touched down. Hirantha Perera converted one of them and also put over a penalty.
Referee: Julien Casaingnede (France).

## Title: What the tongue tells
## Supertitle:

What the tongue tells
Maintaining a healthy tongue is just as important as maintaining strong teeth and gums. The build-up on the tongue is an indication of bacteria that causes bad breath, tooth decay and gum diseases.
A healthy tongue is free of any discomfort such as pain, stinging, burning, swelling or numbness. It is moist, with a rough surface and has an evenly coloured pink surface overlaying pale red.
A careful observation of the tongue, its colour and shape often gives an insight into the health conditions of the individual explains Dr Prathyusha M, consultant dental and cosmetic surgeon. Often when a patient visits a doctor, they are asked to show their tongue. What is the indication that a doctor gets of diseases by seeing the tongue
Inspection of a patients tongue is an important starting point in the clinical examination to understand the health and state of underlying diseases. The different colours of the tongue give an insight into what the patient is suffering from and also helps to evaluate their condition properly.
What do the various colours of the tongue depict
A healthy tongue should be pink and covered with small nodules (papillae). Any deviation from your tongues normal appearance, or any pain is a cause of concern. The different colours are:
* A white tongue, or white spots on your tongue indicates oral thrush  a yeast infection that develops inside the mouth. It appears as white patches that are often the consistency of cottage cheese. It is seen in infants, elderly and also people with diabetes and lung diseases. Oral thrush occurs after taking antibiotics.
* A red tongue is a sign of vitamin deficiency like folic acid and vitamin B-12 deficiencies. When a patient suffers from scarlet fever, the tongue has strawberry like red and bumpy appearance.
* A black tongue is usually harmless and is caused due to medication, smoking, poor oral hygiene, soft diet or dry mouth.
Why must tongue care be an important part of oral hygiene
Tongue care is an important part of oral hygiene as mouth is the gateway to the body and bacteria from the teeth and gums can affect overall health in more ways than one. Bacteria that originate in the tongue can travel throughout the body and cause a host of health problems.
* Heart disease/Stroke risk
Bacteria and plague enter the bloodstream through the gums. The bacteria contains clot-promoting protein that clog arteries leading to an increased risk of heart attack.
* Diabetes
Those who have diabetes have a higher risk of gum disease and it becomes a two-way street for contracting infections as the blood sugar levels are also difficult to control and excess sugars attack the tooth and lead to its loss too.
* Respiratory problems
Bacteria from the mouth can travel through the bloodstream to the lungs where it can aggravate respiratory systems, especially in patients who already have respiratory problems or chronic lung disorders.
How must tongue care be taken
For a thorough cleaning, use a tongue scraper. This tool is usually made of soft, flexible plastic and gently peels the thin mucus-based layer of debris from the tongue. Rinse the scraper under warm water after each swipe of the tongue. If your tongue feels sore or begins to bleed, you are using the tongue scraper with too much force. Work slowly and with light pressure. Concentrate on the center of the tongue where the bulk of odor-causing bacteria lies.
How often must the tongue be cleaned
Each time you brush and floss your teeth, finish your dental care routine with a tongue cleaning. At a minimum, clean your tongue once in the morning and once in the evening before bedtime. PTI
