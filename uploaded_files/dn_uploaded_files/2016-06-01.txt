Gee Ranga Soba to aid undergraduates with financial difficulties
The University of Kelaniya has produced a number of brilliant scholars. Yet, higher education is no comfort at all for some university students in Sri Lanka. For instance, you will find many students with financial difficulties at the University of Kelaniya too. The recently formed Alumni association of the University launched a welfare programme to sustain the current students with financial constraints.
The initial step of the programme was held at Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre in August, 2014. It was a musical concert titled as Vidulakara Gee Ambara which garnered funds to the tune of Rs 50 lakhs, which was converted into a fixed deposit in Peoples Bank. Students with financial difficulties will obtain a sum of Rs 2000 a month throughout the year.
And now the funds are dwindling. But not the students with financial difficulties. They keep on growing in number. The alumni funds 100 students with financial difficulties at the moment. Another musical concert will be held to generate more funds for the benefit of the growing number of students.
The second phase of Vidulakara Gee Ambara will be held at Sri Dharmaloka Convocation Hall, Kelaniya University, on June 3 at 6 pm with Dr Jayalath Manoratne, Nissanka Diddeniya and a host of artistes performing at the concert.

## Title: Sri Lankas utility cricketer

Sri Lankas utility cricketer
Ever since the great Muthiah Muralitharan retired from international cricket Rangana Herath is the man the captain had to turn to, especially for his left-arm bowling skills to win matches. But Herath has not confined himself to contributing to his team only by taking wickets but has also proved to be a useful tailend batsman who could be a thorn to any opposition.
England found that out at Durham on Monday, when they were racing towards a series clinching win. They had picked up the sixth wicket with Sri Lanka still trailing behind by 83 runs from avoiding an innings defeat and were looking to clean up the long tail swiftly when they faced unexpected confrontation from Herath.
For the next two hours or so England tried every trick in the book to dislodge him but he was equal to the task sweeping, reverse sweeping and blocking balls to add to the oppositions frustration.
In the time he spent in the middle with Dinesh Chandimal, Herath raised the total by 116 runs for the seventh wicket and by the time he was dismissed he had made sure that England will have to bat again to achieve victory. Heraths contribution was a gutsy 61 off 99 balls.
Rangana has become a proper no. 8 for us over the past one-and-a-half years, said captain Angelo Mathews complimenting his champion spinner. Hes been scoring and hanging in there. If I recall a couple of years ago at Headingley he batted with me and got 49. Hes been giving his best with the bat and ball for us over the last couple of years. Every day hes been trying to get better. Hopefully he can continue that.
Unfortunately for Herath his plucky effort did not bring the result that his previous two century partnerships had produced, as Sri Lanka ended on the losing side.
On the previous two occasions Herath was involved in rearguard fightbacks he had finished on the winning side  against India at Galle in 2010 and at Headingley in 2014.
The Durham Test also gave Herath his 300th Test wicket, making him only the second bowler in Sri Lankas cricket history to attain that figure after Muthiah Muralitharan and Chaminda Vaas.
In conditions that were less conducive to spin bowling Herath had to labour for 29 overs before finally reaching that landmark. Steve Finn the England number 10 became Heraths victim when he top edged a sweep to him.
Although team members gathered around him to congratulate Herath on his achievement, the circumstances should have been in far better environment than Sri Lanka were placed in. England had by then piled up over 450 runs and the Test seemed as good as gone from Sri Lankas grasp. Sri Lanka had to either win or draw to stay alive in the series, but they were neither anywhere close to achieving that.
When Chaminda Vaas took his 300th Test wicket playing in his 90th Test against India at Delhi trapping Gautam Gambhir lbw in 2005, Sri Lanka finished on the losing side by 188 runs.
Muralitharan completed his 300th Test wicket in 58 Tests, the second fastest to the mark after Dennis Lillee who got there in 55. Muralitharans 300th victim was Shaun Pollock whom he tempted to drive too early and was caught by Tillakaratne Dilshan for 11. Sri Lanka escaped that rain-hit Test played at Durban with a draw.
Herath is the 30th bowler in Test history to cross the 300-wicket mark.
When I made my debut in 2009, I hadnt dreamt of getting to 300 wickets, said Herath. Before 2009, I was in and out of the team. But for six or seven years now, Ive been consistently in the side, and have been the first-choice spinner.
Ive just tried to think about what I need to do for the team. I hadnt thought about the number of wickets, really.
With his fitness being an issue Herath was uncertain how long he could carry on as his countrys number one spinner. He took a wise decision to quit from one-day cricket (50 overs and 20-20) to concentrate on Test matches only to prolong his international career.
When I took 250 wickets, I knew that we had quite a few Tests coming up. With my fitness, I thought that, yes, I should be able to get to 300. But that wasnt a focus for me. I have to thank my teammates for helping me along the way.
Reflecting back on the high moments of his career Herath said, Every bowler will remember his first Test wicket (Ricky Ponting), and thats the same for me. In addition to that I remember taking nine wickets in an innings against Pakistan.
Also when we won a Test in Durban I took nine wickets that was special. Those are the major memories.
At 38 Herath is one of the oldest cricketers around in the international circuit today and Sri Lanka will be hoping this utility cricketer would continue to serve them for a longer period of time.

Anderson, Smith on top of ICC Test rankings
Englands James Anderson has topped the MRF Tyres ICC Player Rankings for Test Bowlers for the first time in his career after bowling his side to a nine-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in the second Test at Chester-le-Street on Monday.
Anderson took three for 36 and five for 58, and, in doing so, has leapfrogged team-mate Stuart Broad and Indias Ravichandran Ashwin into the coveted number-one position. He now leads Broad by 15 points and Ashwin by 13 points.
For his efforts that also fetched him the man of the match award, Anderson has earned 30 points. This means in the two Tests against Sri Lanka, the 33-year-old Lancastrian has collected 79 points and has gained four spots in the rankings.
Anderson is the fourth England bowler to top the bowlers table since Ian Botham first achieved this feat in 1980.
Steve Harmison stormed up the chart in 2004, while Broad vaulted to the number-one position earlier this year following the Johannesburg Test against South Africa.
Broad, who took five wickets in the Test, has slipped behind Ashwin to third place after conceding three points.
Other bowlers to improve their rankings post the Chester-le-Street Test are Nuwan Pradeep (43rd, up by five places), Milinda Siriwardana (50th, up by 13 places) and Chris Woakes (73rd, up by 16 places).
In the batting table, Englands Moeen Ali has achieved a career-high ranking.
The left-handed batsman scored 155 not out, his career-best score in 25 Tests, which helped England to declare its first innings at 498 for nine.
For this achievement, Ali has earned 82 points that has lifted him 12 places to a career-high 35th position in the MRF Tyres ICC Player Rankings for Test Batsmen.
Opener Alex Hales has also continued to head in the right direction. After scoring 83 and 11, the 27-year-old batsman has moved up nine places to 70th. In the past two Tests, Hales has claimed 47 places and looks strong to gain further spots as he is still in the qualification period.
A batsman qualifies for a full rating after he has played 40 Test innings, while Hales has so far batted in only 11 Test innings.
Sri Lankas Dinesh Chandimal, who scored 126 in the second innings, has moved up one place to 19th, while Nick Compton is now in 67th spot after rising one place.
Alastair Cook, who became the first England batsman to complete 10,000 Test runs while scoring 47 not out in the second innings, has retained his 15th position.
Australia captain Steve Smith is the number-one ranked Test batsman, followed by Joe Root of England and New Zealands Kane Williamson.
In the all-rounders list, Ali has gained one place and is now sixth, just one point behind team-mate Ben Stokes. Ashwin is the number-one ranked all-rounder.
The Test player rankings will now be updated after the Lords Test. ICC

SLC's Cricket Aid flood assistance gets underway
Consequent to the recent flood crisis in Sri Lanka, it is estimated that over 500,000 have been displaced. Over a 100 have lost their lives, with as many as 100 still missing and now presumed dead. Many of the displaced are from the Greater Colombo area, where the un-paralleled flooding caused by the Kalani River spilling its banks has led to close to 200,000 persons being severely affected.
Sri Lanka Cricket's Cricket Aid, which is due to launch officially on the June 4 at Lords in London, began immediate relief efforts in the aftermath of this catastrophe and to date have collected several millions of Rupees in aid.
As a primary phase, over 300 volunteers of Cricket Aid comprised of staff, coaches, cricketers and well-wishers spent the day on last Saturday (28) at a Shramadhana to assist the flood affected with resettlement.
Cricket Aid distributed over 3000 aid packages that contained dry rations, bedding, clothing and toiletries and 10,000 Litres of potable water whilst volunteers cleaned and helped in resettlement of over 500 houses.
The campaign is set to continue in the coming week with School books and uniforms being distributed as a second phase.
