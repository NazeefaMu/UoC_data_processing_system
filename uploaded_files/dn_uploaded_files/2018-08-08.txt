447 Luna Tower luxury condominium to be completed in 2020
Colombo has seen a dramatic increase in activity and development. Much of the development has been credited to the real estate sector, which has experienced significant growth in the past five years.
As infrastructure continues to advance in the form of highways and large-scale projects like the Colombo Port City, Colombo as a destination is set to draw further investment appeal. The capacity to invest in premium real estate is increasing as the city transforms into one of the gateway cities in the South Asian region. Commented Eraj S Rajapakse, Senior Manager Projects, Asia Capital PLC.
The Developer ofluxury condominium -447 Luna Tower - occupies a central location on Union Place, in a neighbourhood that offers any and all conveniences from designer shops and upscale restaurants to supermarkets, banks, hospitals and more.
The apartments are priced in Sri Lankan rupees (LKR), while a majority of the other noteworthy residential developments in central Colombo are priced in US dollars (USD). Investors will benefit from the greater capital appreciation of fixed LKR pricing as the US dollar appreciates and the cost of competing developments increase in LKR terms.
447 Luna Tower has been strategically positioned in the upper mid-range segment with 70% of the inventory priced below Rs. 56 Million, which places it within reach of a wide market segment.
The project, which is scheduled to be completed in 2020, is poised to be the only condominium in the heart of the city to strike a perfect balance of elegant design, luxury living and convenience of location at a competitive price.
Upon completion, 447 Luna Tower will offer the optimal combination of luxury and convenience to both home-owners and tenants.
The project has partnered with renowned architect Philip Weeraratne and his firm PWA Architects. The project consultants include Ong & Ong, Singapore an international industry leader providing unrivalled technical expertise, Arup a global giant, headquartered in Hong Kong, a company in structural engineering who has partnered with the projects structural engineers NCD Consultants.

Global warming has affected people in many countries today. Temperature in Japan has increased up to 43 C and many European countries including Spain and France have temperature over 50 C with sudden heatwaves. Heatwaves, water scarcity, rise in sea level, melting glaciers and polar ice caps, and bush fires cause more damage than that of the terrorism.
Air pollution in Kolkata, Mumbai and Dhilli is 70 times higher than the stipulated level. Air pollution in Sri Lanka is minimal because of the air emission programme we began in 2008, he said.

ADB approves $357mn  for development of two  Bangladesh power lines
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved an assistance package totalling more than $357 million for a project to develop two power lines in support of Bangladeshs national target of electricity for all by 2021.
The investments comprise a $350 million ADB loan, a $7 million grant from the Japan Fund for the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JFJCM) to partially finance new high-technology energy efficient conductors, and a $500,000 grant from the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund (EAKPF) to promote socially inclusive growth with gender equality.
Bangladesh has been experiencing impressive economic growth over the last decade, but to maintain and even accelerate this, more investments are needed for the power transmission network to meet growing electricity demand, said ADB Senior Energy Specialist Aiming Zhou.
In support of this, the ADB project will make the power transmission system more efficient, reliable and environmentally friendly.
Despite its recent economic success, Bangladesh continues to face major challenges, said an ADB statement on Tuesday.
A top priority of the government is to address infrastructure deficiencies, including modern and affordable energy services, which face recurring shortages and ever-rising demand. About 35 million people in the country, according to ADB, are without access to electricity.
Inadequate transmission lines and substation transformer capacities in the southern and western regions are the main contributors to transmission bottlenecks.
At the same time, construction of new transmission lines has become more challenging because of the high population density and limited rights-of-way.
The Southwest Transmission Grid Expansion Project builds on ADBs previous work in Bangladesh power sector, including the recently approved Rupsha 800 megawatt Combines Cycle Power Plant in the southwest region, to address continuing deficiencies in the transmission system through providing more efficient power transfer to the load centers of the southern and western zones. The project will develop a 126-km-long 230-kV transmission line from Barishal to Faridpur; and a 104 km-long 400-kV transmission line from Bogra to Rohanpur, along with substations, transformers, and associated extensions and connections.
The new transmission lines will introduce to Bangladesh a new type of high temperature conductor to allow more power transfer at lower energy losses.
These have less resistance to power flow, higher power transferring capacity, and operate more reliably in tropical weather. Besides, the use of these conductors also helps minimise right-of-way requirements.
The project is also contributing to climate change mitigation, since the new conductors reduce carbon dioxide emissions compared to conventional transmission conductors that are used in Bangladesh.
This climate change mitigation accounts for $93 million of the investment, comprising $86 million from the ADB loan and $7 million from the JFJCM grant.
Under the EAKPF grant, the project will fund a scholarship programme that will support womens access to higher education and boost their job opportunities in the electricity industry.
The government will contribute $174.5 million toward the $532 million total cost of the project, which is due for completion at the end of June 2023.
ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 67 members48 from the region.
In 2017, ADB operations totalled $32.2 billion, including $11.9 billion in co financing. (www.daily-sun.com)

Chandra de Silva
Legacy in human values
Chandra de Silvas birth anniversary fell on August 7, yesterday.
On May 26, 1999, a valuable initiative took shape as Chandra de Silva, working then as a consultant to the Open University of Nawala Nursing Programme, wrote the outlines of a plan on a course on Human Values to be included in the BSc Nursing degree. Already in February 1999, she had written to all Heads of Department of the Faculty of Health Sciences, referring to a Faculty Board meeting where the development of such a course had been discussed.
She wrote that This aspect has been highlighted by the U.N. as an essential component in Educationincluding spiritual well-being as an inherent factor in the definition of health as of 1988. In her inimitable way, she requested all the Heads and their staff to record least one quality they would want people to possess as human beings to assist her and her team develop this unit, instantly making them stakeholders in the project.
She added in an encouraging tone that more than one value maybe submitted, which would be most welcome and appreciated. The willing suggestions recorded in response included honesty, kindness, generosity, tolerance, politeness, loyalty, selflessness, courtesy, humility, determination, integrity, patience, thoughtfulness and responsibility, among others.
In the meantime, other universities elsewhere in the world had already included this aspect into their courses. Chandra was already coordinating with them to get her own project off the ground. On February 10, 1999, she had received a letter from Bimla Kapoor of the Indira Gandhi National Open University, New Delhi, who sent her a paper she had written on the Significance of Human Relations in Nursing for the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. She also suggested to Chandra, the idea of developing the MSc Nursing programme jointly between the two universities. Since her own BSc Honors degree was from the University of Delhi in the early 1950s, Chandra worked closely with Indian experts in curriculum development together with those from the Athabasca University of Canada, to develop the first degree programmes for nurses she had been attempting to establish since the 1960s.
Attached to all this correspondence was also a paper written by Professor Afroditi Raya of the Department of Nursing, University of Athens, titled Can knowledge be promoted and values ignored Implications for nursing education in which she concludes that University is a cradle which nurtures intellectuals, professionals and scientists as whole human beings. Paced by the spirit of and the ideals of Padeia, it cannot be limited merely to developing the students mind. It should also inspire the student with a belief in the higher values of life, as a compass in his profession.
A committee had been formed by March 10, 1999 to assist Chandra to develop this course which included several lecturers from the University of Kelaniya, a doctor and specialist teachers. Other distinguished personalities in this field of Human Values had been contacted for contributions, such as Father Mervyn Fernando of Subhodhi, Piliyandala, on the Social Teachings of the Catholic Church, Father Henry Victor of the Eastern University, and Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole. The file of paperwork included extracts from the teachings of the Buddha (including the discourse on Loving Kindness), Hinduism (including the Bhagavat Gita), Jesus: His Life and Teachings, Socrates and Plato among others. These were included as part of the Historical Development of Human Values through philosophers and religious leaders.
The summary of the first meeting as written by Sunanda Degamboda of Kelaniya University shows that the committee agreed to assist in designing a course unit on Human Values for Level 5 (Bachelors degree level) students in the Faculty of Science, Open University of Sri Lanka. Chandra had informed them that there were about 500 students in the Faculty. They decided to include all 26,000 (at the time) students of the whole university at a later date.
I wasn't surprised to find all this and much more, including handwritten notes running into many pages, as she delved enthusiastically into this particular project, crammed into a file titled Human Values, among her papers after she passed away 12 years ago in January 2006. My mother Chandra embodied the best of these values she was attempting impart in the course.
In charge of Nursing Education at the Health Ministry for many years after returning from Boston University with an MSc in Education and Administration in the mid-1960s, facing stiff opposition from the then administration, she would have been delighted at the support that University Education for Nurses has received recently. Chandra tried as hard as she could to make that happen since she returned from Boston (having forgone, at her husbands insistence, the scholarship offered to complete her PhD), and finally established a degree course in1992 at the Open University with sponsorship from the Athabasca University of Canada.
As I celebrate the exceptional human being that Chandra was, on her birthday, August 7, the most remarkable quality about her that I recall is that she placed those human values above all else while she was a dedicated professional, determined and unfazed by the irrational opposition to every innovative suggestion, finding ways of working around all obstacles without ever losing her poise and grace.
My mother was soft spoken, always a refined, gracious lady. Unfailingly polite, gentle with people, she avoided hurting peoplethough she couldnt avoid being hurt by them, emotionally and physically. She persuaded kindly and more often than not, successfully. When she couldnt, she moved on and didnt hold it against them. I was blessed to have such a human being as a mother.
One of the most wonderful things about Chandra was her ability to make you feel better, when tired or ill. Just a hand on your head, a gentle stroking or a kind look and a smile and soft reassurance did more than any medicine. Many just wanted her presence to feel secure when ill. She radiated a healing kindness and empathy. She shared in the pain and took some of it away from you.

Ashore is not greener either
Akkaraihal Pachchai Illai is the name of a book in Tamil by a Lankan writer named Arul Subramaniam who hails from Thiru Koana Malai (Trincomalee). The title of the novel is a maxim well known to everybody. It means Foreign Borders are not green anymore.
It is a gripping fiction written in the 1970s.
But its not a mere thriller as it tries to convey a relevant message, though not in implicit terms: the youth, particularly those who venture to be seamen in foreign cargo vessels, return ultimately home disillusioned. But more than that, this novel introduces to the Tamil reader for the first time, the kind of life the crew in such vessels lead and also the brutality with which they are treated by the hierarchy (foreigners) of the ships.
Realistically and at certain times even in a naturalistic manner the day to day activities in a sailing vessel is fictionally described. An almost microscopic survey of the inside of the vessel is brought before the reader.
Apart from this naturalistic description, the novel tries to present a realistic picture of the harbor workers in our eastern port of Thiru Koana Mlai (Trincomalee), described as the seat of one of the finest natural harbours of the world. We have heard and seen the lives of the Port workers in Colombo but the Trinco Port workers had almost been an almost exclusive Tamil working class (a generation of post generation of the British Naval employees) and as such their social context is a little dissimilar to their counterparts in Colombo and perhaps Gaala (Galle).
The polemics in which some of the workers (a few Sinhalas and a lot more Tamilians) engage themselves, in fact, to bring out these little differences. Another point that emerges from the novel is the solidarity despite differences in attitudes and behaviours of the workers in the Port. This aspect is brought out well in placing the characters in a realistic framework with contradictions and paradoxical situations.
At the same time the novelist has not been able to tighten these episodes to give the novel an artistic finish. Artistically the novel fails to give a satisfying experience, but considering its milieu, the sensitive redder might not quarrel much.
As we observed earlier this novel is a thriller suspense, shock and melodrama, but as a story in itself it is a very interesting novel.
The plot line is this: Four Lankans- three Tamilians and one Sinhala work encounter their experiences in Greek cargo vessel plying between Sri Lanka and the West Asia (Middle East). Their experience had been so terrifying that they place a time-bomb in the vessel so that the cargo ship could be blasted after it reaches the Trinco harbour.
The boys from Trinco and Galle had informed their relatives beforehand of their plans so that the locked-up four Lankans in the boat could be released before the bomb blasts.
It is a rescue operation, chilling like a description in an English novel. But the implied international scandal of destroying a foreign cargo ship and worse still the harbor raises a moral question. This provides the dramatic element in the novel.
The whole story takes place within fifteen hours and the location is the ship itself and the harbor.
In a way this is also a regional novel from Thiru Koana Malai. Arul Subramaniam who hails from Trinco always has settings in his place of birth. The cultural context of this multi-lingual city therefore finds its place appropriately in this novel too. In his first novel he described a Sinhala-Tamil love relationship with the liberalization of the attitudes of the Tamilians in the Trinco district. We must remember that this novel was written in the 1970s.
Arul Subramaniams style of writing is elastic and original as to literally evoke images which are uncommon in local Tamil fiction.

This is what has been instilled in them by their school. Perfect Prefects features Fonseka and Fernando who are bold enough to do what is expected of them.
When Head Girl of Loyola Fernando, speaks up, she does so with conviction. Steadfastly believing that one needs to do the right thing at all times, she presents her ideas with little inhibition.
We need leaders who are honest and committed. They must be unafraid to speak out when they are required to. One must rise to the challenge. Being able to think and act independently I feel is a pre-requisite to leadership, said Fernando.
Taking decisions
Fernando points out to the power of prayer when seeking guidance and also relies on the help of her well-wishers when taking decisions.
We are human and we have all made mistakes in our past. This may be through poor judgment. We have to do the best we can, in the present, and do it to the best of our efforts, and do the right things at the right moment. Basically, do the right thing in life, stated Fernando.
Fernando pointed out that at Loyola, religion is honoured. The education at Loyola builds up the spiritual side of a child while educating him/her about the world. Fernandos ambition in life is to become an accountant and is now making her way through step by step.
Our School focuses on the spiritual aspect of a students personality. A lot of leadership programs are being offered in my school. These leadership programs are available to all students and inclusive of all students, pointed out Fernando.
Fernando explains that God is her refuge, rock and strength and that God has a plan for everyone.
Fellow human beings
I admire Nelson Mandela because he did his utmost for other people. He stood for the rights of others, his fellow human beings. He did so without resorting to violence. Fernando feels that the memory of gaining independence and winning the Civil War can unite us as a country, added Fernando.
Fernando points out that the leaders should be self-sacrificing doing their best for society. They should not run after personal benefits. There is no point going around in cars with tinted windows in a long procession. You need to be in touch with what is going on in your own country.
There are so many people in this world who are suffering. Leaders should listen to them. Leaders should open their eyes. People are struggling with their lives. There are people who have so many different problems. They need help. They need attention, explained Fernando.
Fernando is optimistic. She says that young people can do many things if they put their mind to it. They need to believe in themselves and know that if they work hard they can make a change, said Fernando.
Powerful way
If there is one thing Fernando believes in, it is the power of motivation. She believes that motivation can change lives in a powerful way. Motivation is the name of the game.
I feel that one of the biggest problems in the world is poverty. We need to think about others. There are people out there who are starving. Very few people spare a thought for them. We need to examine our priorities, stated Fernando.
Fernando also expressed her undying gratitude for the Rev. Fr. Rector, the sisters, the teachers of Loyola and her parents for where she is in life and what they have done for her.
Last September we had our investiture 2017. In February we went on a three-day camp. On June 30, we had our prefects day, inviting many schools from Colombo and Negombo. We also did a charity project to help some people blind from birth. The roof of their home needed repairs and we were glad to help, stated Fernando.
Head Boy of Loyola Fonseka feels that the three pillars of leadership are Responsibility, Punctuality and Honesty. To be a leader you need to be in order. You need to be able to handle responsibility. In order to execute the plan, you need to be punctual. You need to be honest if people want to work with you.
Self-assurance
I usually arrive at the best solution after spending time with God in prayer. There is help for those who ask for help. I confidently face my challenges with self- assurance, said Fonseka.
Fonseka feels that his strength is above and next to him. He points out that the reason for his success is God Almighty.
What I have been able to do is because of Gods touch in my life. Also, I cannot forget my parents who have supported me right throughout. My prefects guild has also done a wonderful job in supporting me. I want to become a doctor, that is my goal in life, and I am trying my level best to achieve this. I think it is very important for having dreams and goals in life and you need to achieve them. You need that kind of determination. That commitment stated Fonseka.
Fonseka feels that the teachers cooperation and their dedication has been crucial to forming his personality.
Valued discipline
There is support at all times of the day and the teachers are always ready for counselling. I know how to behave in society because of the values and discipline instilled in me by my school. They have taught me how to be virtuous and how to live in the proper way. I believe life is a gift from God and it is a relationship with him, explained Fonseka.
Fonsekas role model and God is Jesus Christ. Fonseka points out that this is because Jesus had so much influence yet he never misled the masses. He admonished what was wrong and taught what was good.
Again I must point out that being a responsible person is important for society to function well. You cannot pass the buck. You need to shoulder your responsibilities efficiently. Selfishness is a major problem in society because unfortunately people simply do not think about others, explained Fonseka.
Fonseka feels sacrifice is a must if one is to see results. There can be no compromises. As much as the effort matters the results also matter.
Leaders need to manage their time and need to properly manage their lives. You cannot and must not procrastinate. You have to work according to a plan. Lastly, I wish to thank Rev. Fr. Rector for all his guidance, support and motivation. I wish to thank my prefect body because without them this badge is useless, said Fonseka.

Ball tampering threatens crickets DNA says ICC boss
London, Tuesday: Global cricket boss David Richardson declared that ball tampering and bad behaviour threatened crickets DNA and would not be tolerated by fans in the wake of the Australia cheating scandal.
The International Cricket Council chief executive said the public has spoken on bad behaviour in the game as he delivered the annual MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture at Lords on Monday night.
Richardson referred to events during the ill-tempered South Africa-Australia Test series earlier this year when Australia captain Steve Smith, vice-captain David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft were slapped with lengthy bans for their roles in a plan to change the condition of the ball using sandpaper.
Crickets DNA is based on integrity, but we have seen too much behaviour of late that puts that in jeopardy and this has to stop, Richardson said.
Sledging that amounts to no more than personal abuse, fielders giving send-offs to batsmen who have been dismissed, unnecessary physical contact, players threatening not to play in protest against an umpires decision and ball tampering.
This isnt the version of our sport that we want to project to the world.
During that notorious series, South Africa fast bowler Kagiso Rabada was suspended for making contact with Smith, though his ban was overturned on appeal, and there was an ugly off-field scuffle between Warner and South Africa wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock.
As a result the ICC toughened its code of conduct, last month increasing bans for ball-tampering and bringing in new sanctions for verbal intimidation with Richardson saying the ICC was determined to punish ugly and personal abuse.
The public reaction around the world to the incidents in the recent Australia-South Africa series was an eye-opener, said Richardson.
The message was loud and clear, cheating is cheating and its not what we signed up for.
Richardson said he found it a little disingenuous for players to say that rules were unclear about how the condition of the ball could be altered legally.
Over the last few months I have read comments from players requesting guidance what is allowed in relation to the ball, Richardson added.
They have asked if they can chew gum, wear sunscreen or drink a sugary drink.
To be brutally honest I find this a little disingenuous. The laws are simple and straightforward: do not change the condition of the ball using an artificial substance.
If you are wearing sunscreen, sucking a mint or chewing gum with the intent of using the cream or the sugary saliva on the ball you are ball-tampering.
You may not always get caught -- and we are not going to stop players from chewing gum or wearing sunscreen -- but if you are, then dont complain.
Taking the attitude that its always been there to some extent is a mistake. The public have spoken. AFP

For better or verse
Engineering and penning poetry, prose and other creative works may not go hand in hand but young scribe and engineer Tharindu Weerasinghe manages to include both in his life. The 34-year-old past pupil of Maliyadeva College, Kurunegala, and Peradeniya University has produced a collection of articles in two books: one in Sinhala and one in English titled Mata Penena Hati and Life, As I See It!
Speaking about what inspired him to write the collections Thartindu says, I look at life from different perspectives and I identify the aspects of living in black, white and grey shades. I believe and follow the teachings in Buddhism. This motivated me to write about life from my perspective. It includes tips to improve the quality of laymen life.
He says that no sooner had he written the articles, he felt the need to share them with others through print. He contacted local newspapers and sent his work to be published. His writings have been carried in many Sinhala and English newspapers.
It was satisfying seeing my ideas in print and read by many. That kind of lease cannot be purchased through money. After 15 years I went through my work once again and thought of bringing them forth in two books, he said.
Tharindu is the Head of Operations at Seebo Networks Lanka. He says that he thinks of himself as a time-waster. Therefore he tries to make the maximum use of it by engaging in meaningful deeds.
There is a saying that "if you want something to get done - then give it to a busy person". That means an occupied, organised person can always find some time for everything. I am not very good in that sense but I think I have done some worthwhile things apart from my professional work, Tharindu expressed. He has touched topics like human behaviour, cultural degradation, technical development, emotional development etc in his writing.
Speaking about another pet project of his  writing poetry  Tharindu says that he can dub himself as a small-scale lyricist.
I am still a beginner. I have written a few songs during my university days and when I moved to Colombo. Whenever I get an idea and am in a creative mood, I let my pen flow. Writing poetry has never been for monetary gains. It is a passion I enjoy indulging in, Tharindu explained adding that his lyrics are available on http://www.tharinduweerasinghe.com/the-lyricist and see my songs for anyone to read.
we cannot influence to make people good overnight. But the least we can do is share our experience and let them shine better than us. This gives a sense of satisfaction to me. I am not saying that I am a perfect person. But I believe that if I could influence someone through my writing then it will be less suffering for mother Lanka, he said adding that he had gotten positive feedback to his articles and some have even requested to read more of his work.
Speaking about his vision for the future Tharindu says that Sri Lanka has a great potential to become a knowledge hub because Sri Lankans are smart.
National policies need to be implemented. Moving forward should not boil down to government policies. A country should move forward even though governments change. We need to protect our identity and culture as well as our environment and develop. As professionals, we need to give our maximum in building up the nation. You need to have the correct mindset first to make a big change, he opined.
Tharindu has two Masters Degrees, a Charter in Engineering, Bachelors in Engineering. He has penned five books up to now. His latest books Mata Penena Hati and Life, As I See It! are dedicated to his six-year-old daughter. They are available at Sarasavi Bookshop.

Branding opportunity for Colombo
Following the success of the first edition of IRONMAN 70.3 Colombo 2018 which took place in the country early this year and which had managed to attract over 880 participants and over 2300 friends and families from 63 Countries, and foreign exchange contributions close to USD 3 Million into Sri Lankas economic benefit, the organizers have once again joined hands to hold the triathlon for the second consecutive year.
The first triathlon succeeded in drawing participants from around the world to take part in this challenge. The upcoming triathlon is to be held on February 24, 2019, conducted by Pro Am Serendib (Pvt) Ltd. in collaboration with private and public sector organisations such as Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau and the Ministry of Tourism.
The IRONMAN 70.3, which is also dubbed as Half IRONMAN, is part of a series of long distance triathlon races held globally, which was initiated by the World Triathlon Corporation (WTC). The 70.3 in this segment denotes the total distance (113.0 km) covered in the race and consists of a 1.2-mile (1.9 km) swim, a 56-mile (90 km) bike ride, and a 13.1-mile (21.1 km) run. So, each of these distances, comprising of the swim, bike, and run segments is half the distance of that segment in an IRONMAN triathlon.
OVER 14,000 Room Nights in One week!
The event made a significant impact to the travel and tourism sector by attracting 2,300 foreign travellers to Colombo filling rooms and increasing star class, budget hotels and homestay occupancy in the process. Families who travelled from abroad to witness the triathlon unfold were recorded to have stayed over 6 days and spent over USD 400 per day and this in turn helped create significant opportunities for business segments such as Food & Beverage, retail and many others.
Over 70% First Time Visitors to Sri Lanka
The inaugural triathlon attracted over 70% first time visitors from abroad and 92% of them were known to have stayed over in the country for at least three days, simply proving how much Sri Lankas reputation as an ideal tourist destination was elevated from an event of this calibre. From this statistic, at least 40% of the athletes decided to extend their visit or plan a future visit to Sri Lanka to explore the island a bit more.
According to 2016 statistics, Sports tourism makes up less than 1% of the current tourism and hospitality segment and this makes IRONMAN Colombo 70.3 an ideal icebreaker of sorts in Sri Lankas quest to uplift the sports tourism sector in the country. Amongst the total participants, 78% were male and 22% were female athletes.
However, the triathlon also garnered immense interest from 68% of female supporters who turned up to witness the event unfold. A majority of the athletes were between the ages of 25 and 50, though there were some participants who also covered the age groups of below 25 and over 50.
A majority of the participants were recorded from Europe with 40% having had taken part in the first triathlon. Other participants hailed from countries such as the USA, Canada, from the Middle East, Australia and participants from African countries and countries from North East and South East Asia.
Many of the athletes had conducted their own research about Sri Lanka in order to familiarize themselves with what they were about to witness during the event. Those within the 25-35 age group, gathered information from sites such as Trip Advisor and Facebook.

California faces wildfires the size of Los Angeles
US: Multiple wildfires that together grew Monday to nearly the size of Los Angeles could become the worst in fire-prone Californias history, authorities warned.
The River and Ranch fires, which together are called the Mendocino Complex, blackened an area of 273,660 acres (110,750 hectares).
Authorities from state fire agency CalFire reported before midday that it already had mushroomed into the second worst blaze in state history in terms of area burned.
I expect to see it to be number one, unfortunately, this evening, CalFire spokesman Scott McLean said on Facebook.
The largest ever until Monday had been the Thomas Fire in December 2017. It was 440 square miles (1,140 square kilometers) -- almost the size of Los Angeles.
Further north in the state, the Carr Fire has scorched 154,524 acres of land since July 23, when authorities say it was triggered by the mechanical failure of a vehicle that caused sparks to fly in tinderbox-dry conditions. The fire has razed more than 1,600 buildings, including some 1,000 homes, state officials say.
More than 14,000 firefighters were battling the blazes across the state, which has lost another 918 square miles already this year.
The wildfires are extremely fast, extremely aggressive, extremely dangerous, said Scott McLean, a deputy chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Look how big it got, just in a matter of days... Look how fast this Mendocino Complex went up in ranking. That doesnt happen. That just doesnt happen. President Donald Trump raised eyebrows by tweeting about the wildfires inaccurately, claiming there was not enough water to fight them.
California wildfires are being magnified and made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which arent allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized, Trump said. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire from spreading! In fact, we have plenty of water to fight these wildfires, but lets be clear: Its our changing climate that is leading to more severe and destructive fires, Daniel Berlant, CalFire assistant deputy director, told The New York Times. In an unrelated long-running dispute, farmers have demanded more water to irrigate crops for years, while environmentalists say diverting more water to crops would kill off fish stock and hurt rivers. - AFP

Chip & PIN  Credit Cards from COMBANK
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has launched internationally-valid NFC-enabled Chip & PIN CreditCards in collaboration with Mastercard.
The new NFC-enabled Chip & PIN Credit Card offers maximum protection against the skimming or cloning of a card and against counterfeit transactions.It also minimises the possibility of fraudulent transactions at Point-of-Sale(POS) due to the PIN requirement,the Bank said.
This card has both online and offline PIN technology. The online PIN is verified after transmitting the data to the Bank for validations while the offline PIN is validated locally at the POS terminal itself. This card could be used at ATMs to withdraw cash locally and internationally, by entering the PIN, and will function similar to any other Credit Card.
This technology renders the new Mastercard CreditCards smart.Cardholders can receive their Personal Identification Numberseither via SMS to registered mobile numbers or through a physical PIN mailer.Cardholders simply enter their PINs at POS machines to authorise transactions.
Commercial Bank was the first to launch Debit Cards with Chip & PIN technology in the country; the launch of Credit Cards with the same technology, offersa fast-growing customer segment the enhanced security that is an imperative today, Commercial Banks Deputy General Manager Marketing Hasrath Munasinghe said.
The Mastercard CreditCard with Chip & PIN technology is deemed risk averse since it requires the card holder to authenticate each EMV contact transaction using a PIN, or use an OTP (One Time Password) for e-commerce transactions.
Headquartered in New York, Mastercard is a leading global payments and technology company that connects consumers, businesses, merchants, issuers and governments around the world; enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and cheques.
Commercial Bank cards are the fastest growing cards in Sri Lanka and enjoy market leadership in Credit and Debit Card cumulative point-of-sale usage.
The Bank offers a variety of Credit Cards in the Silver, Gold and Platinum tiers of both Visa and Mastercard as well as Visa Signature, World Mastercard and Visa Infinite cards in the premium segment.
The cards are equipped with Tap & Go NFC technology and are backed by a strong NFC Point-of-Sale (POS) network. Commercial Bank Max Loyalty Rewards scheme is the only loyalty scheme that offers loyalty rewards points on both Credit and Debit cards.

Why not levy a Kunu tax
Now almost all of us pay a nominal santhosam to the garbage collector to facilitate easy disposal of our garbage. I suggest that by imposing a tax for garbage collection, the Municipality can pay an extra allowance to these workers as incentives thus discouraging them from accepting bribes.
Isnt it better that we pay the government or rather the Municipal Council, a payment (which is acceptable and legal) than pay a bribe (which is despicable, illegal and a punishable offence), to the garbage collector. This is the way forward to eliminate bribery, that is, by increasing the payments made to the garbage handlers.
Over to Inland Revenue Department to consider the above proposal to convert the bribe to kunu tax! This will also solve to some extent the garbage issue for Mayoress Rosy Senanayake.
It is also possible that the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) could be disbanded if we could eliminate bribery completely or if it can be at least reduced drastically. This will strengthen good governance in Sri Lanka and make our country a model for other countries.

Filing an affidavit before the Court of Appeal, B.Denishwaran alleged that Northern Province Chief Minister C.V Wigneswaran and several others have willfully acted in contempt of the Court of Appeal order since they prevented him from acting as a Minister of the Northern Province.
The Court of Appeal had issued an Interim Order, preventing the decision of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V Wigneswaran to remove B. Denishwaran from functioning as the Minister of Fisheries and Transport in the province.
Denishwaran stated in his affidavit that the first Respondent, Justice Wigneswaran has, by his conduct and statements, acted in contumacious and willful disobedience of the order of Court of Appeal and thus committed an act of contempt against the authority and dignity of the Court of Appeal.
The petitioner further alleged that Chief Minister Wigneswaran willfully intended to act in defiance of the order of Court of Appeal notwithstanding the fact that no Order has been issued by the Supreme Court staying the operation of the said Order of Court of Appeal.
The petitioner cited Chief Minister Wigneswaran, K.Sarveswaran and K.Sivanesan as respondents.
The Court of Appeal on June 29 issued an Interim Order preventing the decision of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran to expel B. Denishwaran from functioning as the Fisheries and Transport Minister in the province.

Wigneswaran in the Court of Appeal, complaining that the Chief Minister had no power to appoint or remove any Provincial Council minister. The petitioner cited Chief Minister Wigneswaran, K.Sarveswaran, Ananthi Sasitharan, G. Gunaseelan, K.Sivanesan and P. Sathyalingam as well as Governor Reginald Cooray as respondents.
The petitioner claims he was one of the members of the Northern Province Board of Ministers. He states that in October 2016, a dispute arose with respect to the conduct of ministers, following which the Chief Minister appointed an inquiry panel.

Currans example inspires England new boy Pope
LONDON:Ollie Pope hopes to follow in the footsteps of fellow 20-year-old Surrey rising star Sam Curran during England's Test series with India.
Top-order batsman Pope is set to make his England debut at Lord's later this week after being called into the squad for the second Test in place of the dropped Dawid Malan.
County colleague Curran starred with both bat and ball as England beat India by 31 runs in the first Test at Edgbaston last week to go 1-0 up in the five-match series.
Now Pope, who has played just 15 first-class matches, would love the chance to prove, as Curran did in Birmingham, the old adage that 'if you're good enough you're old enough' right.
The way he (Curran) played last week can give me confidence to know I can do it, Pope told reporters at Lord's on Tuesday.
I've played with him since we were 14 or 15 -- as soon as he came over from Zimbabwe -- and we've gone through the same path.
I've had a good season so far. I have confidence in my own game to take the next step. AFP

Dividends not paid for EPF funds invested in SriLankan - Company Secretary
Although unauthorised EPF funds had been invested to purchase shares in Emirates owned Sri Lankan Airlines in 2010, what happened to its dividends owed to 13.3 million EPF members still remain a mystery.
The manner in which dollars were credited to the EPF maintained in a Sri Lankan rupee account is also a dilemma, SriLankan Airlines Company Secretary Dalrene Thirukumar said.
She gave evidence before the Presidential Commission Investigating into alleged Fraud, Corruption and Misuse of State Funds and Property in Sri Lankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering Services and Mihin Lanka.
Thirukumar disclosed this when Additional Solicitor General Neil Unamboowe PC asked her to produce before the commission any document or note made relating to the dividends owned to the EPF from such unauthorised investments.
ASG Unamboowe submitted that Section 5 of the EPF Act stated the strategies to be adopted in investing EPF Funds. But according to evidence given by witness Thirukumar, neither those strategies had been adopted or Monetary Board approval obtained to invest EPF funds in the Airline.
Thirukumar said more than one million shares worth over 4 million US dollars had been issued to the EPF. She said the Cabinet and Monetary Board approval had been taken to buy these shares.
The shares had been purchased on the strength of a letter then Bank of Ceylon Chairman Gamini Wickremesinghe had sent to then Treasury Secretary Dr. P. B. Jayasundera. She produced the relevant letter before the Commission. Although SriLankan shares given to Banks by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in his capacity as Finance Minister had been reclaimed by Banks, EPF shares had not been reclaimed by it, she added.

Do they care
The chairman of the four-member committee appointed to conduct a comprehensive investigation into Mondays train accident at Pannaliya, off Polgahawela, Operating Superintendent of Railways, V.S Polwattage yesterday told the Daily News that investigations of the site have been completed and the next step of recording statements from relevant officials will begin today.
We will be able to submit the final report in the next two or three weeks, Polwattage said.
The Rambukkana-bound train struck the Colombo  Kandy train which had halted at Pannaliya near Polgahawela due to a technical fault, on Monday evening. Several passengers were criticaly injured.
Polwattage, along with other committee members - Deputy Chief Engineer (Way and Works), Deputy Chief Engineer (Motive Power) and Deputy Chief Engineer (Signal and Communication), is tasked with producing a comprehensive report on the collision between two trains in Panaliya, between Rambukkana and Polgahawela, on the Upcountry Railway Line.
A spokesman for the Civil Aviation and Transport Ministry said that four railway workers, including the engine driver, assistant driver, guard and assistant guard of the Rambukkana-bound train involved in Mondays accident have been interdicted, pending investigations.
Civil Aviation and Transport Minister Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva has directed the Railways General Manager (GM) to interdict the officials, pending an inquiry.
The minister has instructed the GM to take disciplinary action against the responsible persons, irrespective of their positions.
It is unfortunate that public confidence in the train services is lost due to the actions of irresponsible train drivers of this sort, he added.
Sri Lanka Railways Additional General Manager (Operations) Wijaya Samarasinghe said that at least 36 passengers were injured due to the accident and 29 had been admitted to Polgahawela Hospital, Kegalle Hospital, Rambukkana Hospital and Kurunegala Teaching Hospital.
Eight of the injured have been warded at Kurunegala Teaching Hospital and one person is receiving treatment at Polgahawela Hospital, while 16 others have been warded at Kegalle Hospital. Four other are receiving treatment at Rambukkana Hospital.
The accident also disrupted train services on the Upcountry Railway Line. Some trains including the night mail train which was to travel from Colombo to Badulla last night were cancelled.
Polwattage said that as of now, train services can operate along one track on the Upcountry Railway Line and immediate measures have been taken to restore upcountry train services to their usual schedule.
Railways General Manager (GMR) S.M. Abeywickrama said that this is the first train accident reported with a number of injured persons, after he assumed duties as the GMR.
The Railway service has been in the news in the recent past over a number of derailments, accidents and commuter deaths.
An eyewitness who wishes to remain anonymous said that as a person who has travelled daily to Colombo by train for the last 15 years, he has experienced several train accidents. These types of accidents should not happen in the modern world. The safety of passengers should be the number one priority of the Railways, he said.
How can a train running on the same track approach another train Why is there no signal to stop the train behind, when the train in front has been stalled If there is no such signal, the question is whether the Railway operations centre has informed the driver of the train that follows about the stalled train in front. Who is looking after the safety of passengers the eye witness asked.
Another eyewitness, Anjali Ramanayake, who was on board the Kandy-bound train which had stalled at Panaliya in Polgahawela due to a technical fault, said that several passengers who were on the footboard were thrown out and passengers in the last two compartments of the Kandy train and the two front compartments of the Ranbukkana-bound train were injured.
My head and leg are still paining and my father who travelled with me cannot even stand as he struck his leg badly, she said.

Epic Jurassic  Park themed wedding
A couple who bonded over Jurassic Park brought their obsession to life by making the movie the theme of their wedding.
28-year-old Courtney McMillion has loved Jurassic Park since she was a kid, and was over the moon when she found out her now-husband Billy McMillion, 26, was also a fan, when they began dating in 2013.
Event manager Courtney and Billy, an engineer, always joked they would have a Jurassic Park themed big day.
Then, when they got engaged last February, the couple decided to make it a reality. Courtney spent 18 months organizing the $25,000 wedding, which was complete with dinosaur decorations and saw her arrive in a Jeep Wrangler.
Their venue, The Landings 1841, in Burlington, Wisconsin, was decked out in forest greenery and their 170 guests were issued VIP passes for the prehistoric ceremony.
The bride walked down the aisle to the movies theme tune and groom Billy even crafted a doughnut wall to look like the front gates of the fictional park.
Courtney said she had a blast planning her dream day but said there was a fine like when it came to keeping it elegant.
She said, It was more so me who always loved Jurassic Park. I remember watching it when I was small and thats when I first fell in love with it. When the original first came out in IMAX, I was so excited but no one would go with me. At the time me and Billy were just good friends and he offered to go. We started dating in October 2013 and we just loved staying in and watching movies together. We would regularly watch Jurassic Park or it would coincidentally be on TV. It sort of become our thing. We would go to dinosaur museums and exhibits on dates. I used to joke that our wedding should be Jurassic Park themed and after we got engaged, I started to think, why not I work at my wedding venue, where I see weddings three times a week. Theyre all hydrangeas and babys breath. Theyre beautiful but I wanted something different.
Billy said that when Courtney first suggested the dinosaur themed wedding he was a little sceptical.
He explained, I wanted a country wedding but the more we talked about the more interesting the idea became. Everyone loved it I was scared people were going to think it was childish but Courtney being as crafty as she is, it was super pretty and held the theme really well.
One of the highlights of the day for Courtney was arriving to the ceremony in a Jeep, supplied by a fellow fan in Iowa.
Courtney said, Ive always wanted a Jeep Wrangler like in Jurassic Park so a couple of years ago I joined this group on Facebook called Jurassic Park Motors, where fans renovate jeeps to look like those in the movie. I really wanted to feature one of these jeeps in the wedding and I just asked in the group if anyone wanted to come. One man, JurassicPark09, whose real name is Adam, drove all the way from Iowa to help us. He was so dedicated and it really made our day.
Billy added, My favorite part of the day was seeing Courtney in her wedding dress and being in awe of how beautiful she was.
The bride said although she was really dedicated to the theme she did not consider decking out her bridal party in dino-themed attire.
Courtney said, I never considered wearing Jurassic Park costumes. I think that would have crossed the fine line. I didnt want it to be too much of a spectacle. It was fun, but it was still a wedding after all.
Cassandra Spiegelhoff, who photographed the couple on their big day, said it was exciting to work on a wedding that was so different from the rest.
The wedding photographer even photoshopped some dinosaurs into the final prints for the happy couple.
Cassandra said, We shoot 50 weddings every year and theres always the same poses, the same readings, the same speeches. This wedding was so different. The Jurassic Park theme could have been so lame but it wasnt tacky or cheap. It was so elegant. She really nailed it. It was amazing. You could tell it was the best day of their life.

Erode organic  farmers set to take sugarcane plunge
Going organic seems to be yielding rich dividends for the Erode Uyir Iyyarkai Vivasaigal Sangam (Erode Uyir Natural Farmers Society). So much so that its members are raring to go a step further and bring into their fold about 1,000 acres of land in Tamil Nadu for organic sugarcane cultivation.
The 64 members of the society have already undertaken organic farming on about 400 acres in the State.
Formed two years ago, the agricultural society has secured group organic certification for most of its members and also runs a retail outlet in Erode to sell their organic produce including pulses, vegetables, turmeric, sugarcane jaggery powder and processed food items. Most of the value-added products are made by the farmers with the resources available with them.
In its latest effort, Uyir is trying to bring together about 1,000 acres of land under organic sugarcane cultivation across the State.
This year, the rains have been good. So, if not 1,000, we can have at least 500 acres of organic sugarcane with us in another three to four months, said R. Ravichandran, the president of the society. At least 25% of the farmers with Uyir are into sugar cultivation.
Asked about the scope of bringing in such a vast extent of land under organic sugarcane cultivation at a time when large sugarmills in the State are hit by low cane production due to drought over the last four years, Mr. Ravichandran said the number of farmers going organic was on the rise because of better awareness. Further, organic sugarcane jaggery powder has high demand.
Better returns
Even I was supplying cane to a sugarmill before I switched to organic farming. Now, I get better returns, he said. Under the initiative, Uyir plans to pay farmers 3,600 for a tonne of sugarcane. We sell about two tonnes of sugarcane jaggery powder at our outlet for about 65 a kg. We plan to buy cane from farmers who register with us and start making sugarcane jaggery powder, he said.
There are small scale units that make the powder. If the demand is good, the society will explore setting up a common unit. Otherwise, it will use the existing facilities. (The Hindu)

Feminine touch of dance
In almost all the Indian classical and folk dances females play an important role in the cultural life of the people. In any country, culture reveals the pattern of lifestyle, customs and traditions relating to regional and religious practices and historical background of the society.
Earlier practically females were the dominating figures in the fields of fine arts, especially in the fields of dance, music, sculpture and paintings. From the very beginning, female temple dancers and female court dancers enjoyed a prestigious position in society. Earlier temple dancers were called Devar Adiyarkal, Devadasis, Sathirkaaris or Pathiyeayalar.
Architectural sculptures
In Vaishnava temples, the dancers were called Sri Vaishnava Manikam. The females made their contribution to the dance in different forms. Their contribution is mainly depicted in temple mandapa sculptures, temple pillar sculptures and temple gopura sculptures. Even dancing female figures were depicted in the general architectural sculptures. Similarly, even in the paintings, we could see the female contribution to the dance, mainly in temple walls and roof paintings, temple pillar paintings, dancehall curtain paintings, in stage decoration and cut-out paintings.
In some dances in the past males dominated the scene but now females play an important role. It could be seen in Indian classical dances such as Odissi and Kuchipudi. Meanwhile, Mohini Attam is practised by females alone and Kathakali is still practised by males only.
Stone plate inscriptions
Even the names of the female dancers could be seen in several inscriptions. This could be seen in the copper and stone plate inscriptions. These inscriptions give the names of numerous female dancers and their awards. The titles conferred on them and the details of the awards. The titles were well defined. Even earlier, as well as today, in the field of classical and folk dances, the most attractive and the most outstanding performing artistes are females.
Even the decorations adopted by female dancers such as hairdressing and facial makeup are more elaborate than those of the male counterparts. The female dancers wore differently designed costumes than their male counterparts.
Certain classical items such as Meenakshi Talaadu, Andal Thirukalyanam and Kurathi are only performed by female dancers. They adopt the costumes, makeup and hairdressing, according to the role of the selective dances. Female folk dancers are generally called Koothukaris or Koothier in Tamil and by different names in diverse states.
The colourful and glittering costumes are selected by the females. Simple beautiful makeup was always adopted by female folk dancers and the majority of them wore colourful shawls over the heads. Most of the dancers danced with decorated sticks or pots or holding decorated shawls or lamps in the hands. The folk dances are mainly performed by groups with a variety of colourful costumes. Some folk dances are only performed by female dancers and some are performed by females and males together and some are performed by males alone. In both classical and folk dances, beautiful, graceful movements, stands, curving and bending positions could be seen more among female dancers than male dancers.
The contribution and the role of female dancers in the practical dance field, as well as in the dance research field, are much better than those of the male dancers.

## Title: Gibran and his creative wisdom

Gibran and his creative wisdom
A medical doctor living in England once told me that since reading the Lebanese-American writer, poet, playwright and painter, Kahlil Gibran (1883  1931), he had changed his scientific profession to more of a spiritual healing process. I was so inquisitive that raised some questions to help build a better climate of opinion on Gibran and his healing process.
Its a matter of reading Gibran that matters. Start reading the work or the book titled The Prophet. Then proceed on to A Tear and A Smile. You come across short creative parables, observations, human experiences on matters such as birth, growing up, love, greed, hunger, sickness and death. But most of the creative sketches help you to understand who you are.
I managed to purchase a copy of the complete works of Kahlil Gibran, a compilation of twelve books in one volume sans the name of the compiler and other details perhaps wanted by students.
Different titles
The volume I possess is published in India by Indiana publishing House in 2008. Out of those twelve books some have appeared perhaps earlier and the titles given differ. The order of the arrangements too differs. Prior to the publication of the complete works, there had been random isolated single books translated from the Lebanese Arabic language to English by various hands. Then later on when Gibran spent his last 25 years in America, he began to write some of his works in English with the help of a few others. The work titled Kahlil Gibran, The Voice of Kahlil Gibran, an anthology as edited by Robin Waterfield (Arkana, Penguin Books 1993) is one such example.
In this volume, quite a number of creative pieces are culled from works of Gibran such as The Prophet (1923), The Broken Wings (1912), A Tear and a Smile (1914), Spiritual Sayings (1962); Gibran commences his creative writing mixed in philosophy via the work titled The Madman (1918). This contained a series of parables and poems that disseminate knowledge and wisdom on day to day matters. The title looks rather ironic, as they are not narrated by mere insanity but via a penetrative vision.
At the outset the narrator seems to say:
You ask me how I became a madman. It happened thus: one day long before many gods were born, I woke from a deep sleep and found all my masks were stolen  the seven masks I have fashioned and worn in seven lives  I ran maskless through the crowded streets shouting, thieves, thieves and cursed thieves (135pp). When everybody ran to rescue from the madman, a youth standing on a house top had said: He is a madman. Then the following line appears: I looked up to behold him, the sun kissed my own naked face and my soul was inflamed with the love for the sun and I wanted my masks no more. (135pp)
From here onwards, the madman becomes a saint who says quite a lot of wise sayings that entice the attention. Thus the question of who is a god is answered. The sketch on My friend explaining who a good friend is reminding one of the concept of Kalyana Mitra in Buddhist literature. Quite a number of parables appear. One quite a short parable as uttered by the madman goes as follows:
Once there lived a man who had a valley full of needles. One day the mother of Jesus came to him and said:
Friend my sons garment is torn and I must need to mend it before he goeth to the temple. Would thou not give me a needle And he gave her not a needle, but he gave her a learned discourse on giving and taking to carry to her son before he should go to the temple. (140pp)
Much discussed aphorism
From the sensitive and penetrative episodes of the madman, the reader could proceed to the much discussed aphorism and prophesies of Gibran. Most of them appear in his work A Tear and a Smile. Once translated from the original Arabic and later written afresh by Gibran himself. I wish to present a few that I prefer.
God has made many doors opening into truth which He opens to all who knock them with hands of faith.
It is the mind that yields to the laws made by us, but never the spirit in us.
Beauty is that which attracts your soul and that which loves to give and not to receive.
Poetry is not an opinion expressed. It is a song that rises from a bleeding wound or a smiling mouth.
A poet is a dethroned king, sitting among the ashes of his palace, trying to fashion an image out of the ashes.
A singer cannot delight you with his singing unless he himself delights to sing.
Scholars believe that Gibran who was born near Mount Lebanon had the advantage of perceiving the knowledge the oral folk and religious knowledge transmitted over the years. The millions of Arabic-speaking people were familiar with his original writings and considered him a sort of a poet cum saint and a genius. Gibran for many years happened to be the leader of a Lebanese literary circle in New York prior to his demise in 1931. Works of Gibran are translated from time to time into more than 20 world languages, inclusive of Sinhala and Tamil. A well known scholar Claude Bragden once said:
His (Gibrans) power came from some great reservoir of spiritual life, else it could not have been so universal and so potent, but the majesty and beauty of the language with which he clothed were all his own.

GL slams Amaraweera over post of Opposition Leader
UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera had not consulted other UPFA constituent parties before handing over a letter on the partys stance regarding the appointment of a UPFA MP for the post of Opposition Leader, to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Prof. G.L. Peiris said yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing organised by the Joint Opposition in Colombo yesterday, he said that the UPFA General Secretary had acted in an arbitrary manner by forwarding an opinion to the Speaker without consulting the other parties of the UPFA.
He said the Speaker should look into this matter and inquire whether Amaraweera has acted fairly and with responsibility.
Peiris said that if Amaraweera had consulted other UPFA constituent partners, they may have differed with his opinion on the Opposition Leaders post.
Peiris charged that Amaraweera, by not consulting other UPFA partners, was trying to deny a JO member from becoming the Leader of the Opposition.
On July 30, a letter signed by eight UPFA Parliamentarians requesting that the post of Leader of the Opposition in Parliament to be given to the UPFA, was submitted by MP Dinesh Gunawardena to the Speaker.
The Speaker, in return, referred the matter to the UPFA, since all those who signed the request were UPFA members.
The Leader of the Opposition, according to the Constitution, should be given to the party with the highest number of seats in the Opposition and not to a party which is a coalition partner in the government.

Injured du Plessis out of Sri Lanka tour
South Africa captain Faf du Plessis will miss the remaining two ODIs and the lone T20I against Sri Lanka after sustaining an injury to his right shoulder.
Du Plessis fell awkwardly while attempting a catch in the 10th over of the Sri Lankan innings during the third ODI on Sunday and immediately left the field for treatment. He was not able to return and will need up to six weeks to make a full recovery.
"Faf sustained an injury to one of the rotator cuff tendons in his right shoulder and will unfortunately be unavailable for the rest of the tour.
He will need a rehabilitation period of up to six weeks to make a full recovery. His return date back to South Africa will be confirmed in due course," Mohammed Moosajee, South Africa's team manager, who is also a medical doctor, said.
South Africa will name a replacement captain from within the squad, with no additional players to be added for the three matches. Quinton de Kock took over the leadership on Sunday and may be given the opportunity to captain again.

Post of Opp. Leader: Speaker to announce final decision within this week
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament that he would come to a final decision and announce the post of Opposition Leader within this week.
The Speaker at the same time agreed to allocate more time and grant more space in Parliamentary Committees for the Joint Opposition to be fair with the numbers it is representing.
The Joint Opposition members were all-out in Parliament yesterday to win the post of Opposition Leader to their group, stating that they had the support of 70 MPs. However, both the JVP and the TNA were against JOs request, stating that the UPFA could not represent the Government and the Opposition at the same time.
Following a lengthy argument in the House, the Speaker said that he has to consult the Party Leaders and legal advisers before making a final decision on the post of Opposition Leader. He added that he still had to sort out two pertinent issues, but did not elaborate what they were.
The JO MPs continuously argued that the mantle of the Opposition Leaders post was given to UPFA MP Nimal Siripala de Silva during the interim period of the government after January 8, 2015 and the Government could follow the same precedent now.
However, this argument was countered by the JVP, stating that the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was not in force during the interim period and therefore the Constitution then lacked a specific definition as to what a recognized political party is.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella commented that Parliament only accepts recognized political parties and that the JO was only a clique.
TNA MP M A Sumanthiran, expressing TNAs position on the issue in the absence of TNA Leader R Sampanthan, said if the JO wished to be the real Opposition, its members should leave the UPFA. The Leader of the Opposition post could not be held by a person who belonged to a party that had members in the Cabinet. The UPFA Chairman, its General Secretary and over 20 members are members of the Cabinet and are part of the Executive. It would be a mockery to have yet another UPFA MP sitting as the Opposition Leader as well, he stressed.
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake demanded that the entire Cabinet should first resign if the UPFA is to get the post of Opposition Leader, because there could no longer be a national government after that. The number of ministers was increased under the pretext of forming a national government. If the UPFA is given the Opposition Leader post, then the number of ministers should be limited to 30 under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, he argued.
He also pointed out that giving the mantle of the Opposition Leader to the UPFA could set a bad precedent that the future rulers may exploit to retain the control of both the Government as well as the Opposition. At the same time, he reminded the House that JOs de facto leader former President Mahinda Rajapsaka had not voted against the Government at any crucial vote in Parliament.
Former President Rajapaska, his brother Chamal Rajapaksa and his son Namal Rajapsaka were all not present in the House even yesterday, when the House took up the matter of Opposition Leader.
JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena, rising to a point of order at the commencement of the business of the House, requested for a fresh determination of the Speaker on the post of Opposition Leader, considering the latest changes in the number of heads in the Government and the Opposition benches.
MP Gunawardena in his speech, raged against UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera, stating that the Speaker could not be dictated by an incompetent, ignorant and inefficient General Secretary of a party. He made this comment with reference to a reply letter of Amaraweera to the Speaker in which he had informed that the UPFA did not wish any change in the post of Opposition Leader.
This is an issue that distorts Parliament democracy. You admitted that the ground situation had changed when we met you in person, MP Gunawardena told the Speaker. He argued that the JO group led by former President Mahinda Rajapaka, was the largest group in the Opposition.
MP Dullas Allahapperuma noted that 70 MPs of the JO represent 31 percent of the total 225 MPs in Parliament, while 16 TNA MPs represent only 7 percent.
However, Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara countered this argument by stating that some MPs who claim to represent the Opposition were seen with the President when inaugurating various projects in Polonnaruwa recently. Your faith is questionable. Before you demand your stake in Parliament, clearly identify which side you belong to, he told the UPFA MPs.
UNP MP Mujibar Rahuman pointed out that the entire issue of Opposition Leader was a result of an internal rift of the UPFA and there was no point in wasting Parliaments time over it. If you wish to claim the Opposition Leader post, the best thing to do is to press the President and your General Secretary to sit in the Opposition, he commented.
UNP MP Thushara Indunil said the UNP back benchers would also cross over to the Opposition and demand the rights and privileges given to an opposition group if this trend continued.
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake suggested that the JO could rightfully claim the Opposition Leader post if they, who claim to have 70 MPs, grab power of the UPFA Executive Committee defeating the 23 members aligned with the Government.
UPFA MPs Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Chandima Weerakkody, Udaya Gammanpila, Bandula Gunawardena, Nimal Lansa, Sisira Jayakody, Arundika Fernando, Tharaka Balasuriya, Susil Premajayantha and John Seneviratne also joined in bolstering MP Gunawardenas call to give them the Opposition Leader post.
UPFA MP Kumara Welgama however, admitted plainly that there was no party called the Joint Opposition and that he was speaking as an SLFP MP. After August 17 polls, my name was proposed as the Opposition Leader and my friend MP Mahindananda Aluthgamages name was proposed as the Chief Opposition Whip, but this was not accepted then, he commented.

Proposal to offer Rs. 200,000 allowance to monitoringMPs not approved: Kiriella
A proposal to offer Rs 200,000 allowance to Government MPs who are monitoring development projects, was not approved at the Cabinet yesterday, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He made this comment in reply to NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa who charged that the Government had presented Cabinet papers to offer Rs 200,000 special allowance to monitoring MPs of the Government.
The Minister replied that the said Cabinet paper was not approved yesterday. The minister further said the UNP Group yesterday, unanimously decided to reject any salary increments to MPs and Ministers.
However, he claimed the issue over the MPs salaries came up due to a Parliamentary Resolution adopted on November 23, 2006, which linked them to the Judges salaries. When the issue was discussed on July 17, all party leaders had been in agreement with the point that the MPs salaries must be increased on par with those of the judges, he stated.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said that matters pertaining to salaries, health insurance and pensions of MPs were discussed at the Party Leaders Meeting, but a final decision was not reached. It is the Governments prerogative to take a final decision. We in the Opposition cannot force anything on the Government, he commented.

Highest standards followedby foreign countries to combat corruption will be endorsed
The highest standards followed by foreign countries to combat corruption would be endorsed by Sri Lankan jurisdiction as well, State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P. Perera said yesterday.
Joining the Second Reading of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Amendments) Bill, State Minister Perera observed that whoever objects or is intimidated by passing of the Bill, would be involved in rackets, bribery and corruption.
State Minister Perera also observed that legislation operating in Sri Lanka must be upgraded to the standards of international laws, to which the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (MAICM) Act would contribute immensely.
Perera pointed out that the amendments would provide Sri Lanka a strong international cooperation, mutual assistance for investigations concerning criminal offenses relating to computer systems and data, evidence collection in electronic forms of criminal offenses.
He pointed out that the Asia/Pacific Organization on Money Laundering too had recommended that Sri Lanka upgrade its laws in keeping with the international law.
Speaking further, Perera said that the Yahapalana Government had proven that it was dedicated to bring in anti-corruption laws by presenting amendments to the MAICM Act of 2002. He pointed out that the Act provided for significant provisions. He also pointed out that passing of the Bill would facilitate the accelerated process of combating bribery and corruption, taken up by the Yahapalana Government.
This Act terrifies persons who are involved in crime and corruption. Suspects would no longer be able to find refuge in other countries, dodging investigations carried out locally. This Act is extremely progressive, Perera further observed.
MAICM Act facilitates cooperation between Sri Lanka and other selected jurisdictions in the exchange of suspects and witnesses. It provides for the services of documents on such persons, the examination of witnesses, obtaining of evidence, executing requests for search and seizure, temporarily transferring a person in custody to appear as a witness and the location of the proceeds of crime among others.

Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri, who was in the Chair, asked for the consent of the House to continue after 6.30pm till the days business was over, but the JO group led by NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa asked for a division to extend the time and resorted to shout and disrupt Government business.

The National Sustainability Discourse is in operation efficiently to obtain the ideas of all. This would be implemented in all provinces. Through this process, the public will get an opportunity to identify issues and engage in dialogue.

S. Thomas College, Mt. Lavinia OBA launches Alumni Web Portal
The Old Boys' Association (OBA) of S. Thomas' College, Mt. Lavinia re-launched their website, along with a new Alumni Portal, on August 3.
The new Alumni Portal facilitates collaboration between the membership and the OBA in student development and other OBA projects.
The Alumni Portal is rich in features, such as Newsrooms, Facebook-like Discussion forums, Job Portals, Event Management capabilities, Mentorship programmes for students or young old boys, and will have an online store for STC souvenirs and memorabilia.
The Alumni Portal will enable members to maintain rich member profiles, which will facilitate targeted communications and fast search for the OBA, while providing state-of-the art security in order to maintain strict privacy of personal information. Members can also self-determine the level of visibility for (each attribute of) their personal information, to their batch mates and the broader membership.
The Alumni portal also has separate sections for Class Groups, Overseas Chapters and Special Interest Groups, providing a unified platform for alumni from different vintages, geographies and interests to come together, while maintaining their unique identities and interests.
Warden Rev. Marc Billimoria said the Alumni Portal would be an ideal platform to enable the OBA to live up to the original objectives of Warden Miller, who first established the OBA "with a view to the strengthening of the ties, which should bind a man to the place where, it is to be hoped, he has learned some of the most valuable lessons of life. Such a society in connection with S. Thomas' College would, I think, promote this desirable result, but it would have a further very beneficial effect. It would be a means of giving lads (old boys) a sort of rallying point. They would be more likely to come under good influence. They would be less liable to get lost sight of".
The Alumni Portal is one of many projects undertaken by the OBA to strengthen ties between the school and its alumni. The Old Boys' Association of S.Thomas' College, Mt. Lavinia was established in 1886 and is one of the oldest Alumni associations in Sri Lanka.

Death of Artygalle
Secret of a conspiracy
Death of Dixon Artygalle and birth of Uncle-Nephew Politics: Sensational Trial 112 years Ago is the true story of emergence of Senanayakes, Kotelawalas and Jayewardenes in Sri Lankan Politics, the source that financed their activities, and also the concealed hostility, enmity and rivalry for preeminence among the three families that formed the upper crust of the United National Party hierarchy for many decades that commenced during the time of this saga and reached its peak in 1952, enduring up to the end of last century.
After the not so harmonious wedding ceremony of the eldest daughter, the Artygalles concern for the future of the other two girls became greater than before, prompting them to find two educated grooms from affluent families-a few years after Mudaliar passed away leaving two unmarried girls and the only son, for widow Mrs Peternella Artigalle, nee Abeykoon to accept proposals brought in by the marriage brokers for her two younger daughters.
Second in the family Leena married Col. T.G. Jayewardene an engineer, who had four lawyer siblings; including Supreme Court Judge E.W (JR Jayewardenes father); the third sister Ellen to Barrister F R Senanayake, MMC, Diplomat and older brother of D S Senanayake. Kumari Jayawardena-2007
Each of the second and third daughters, Leena and Ellen received 2861 and 3027 acres respectively of cultivated land, out of tea, rubber and coconut estates, plus a share of graphite mines, and Rs 200,000 in cash, [more than a century ago] as dowry[Ref.-Nobodies to Somebodies: KJ-2007- pp 288] much more than the eldest girl Alice who married Kotelawala; an inequitable and unpardonable discrimination that brew hatred and jealousy in the mind of John. The youngest in the family Francis Dixon was yet a minor attending school at Wesley College, Pettah, who won the accolades of its Head-master P C Dias.
Singhoni Perera, the loyal Police sergeant who served under John Kotelawala (Snr) in the police, resigned from the department along with his superior officer at the latters request who promised a job with the enormous Attygalle Estate which he was managing since the father-in-law, Mudaliar Geromis Artygalles untimely death.
Kahatagaha mines
Mrs Petronella Artygalle, the mother-in-law filed a case in the District Court, Kurunegala to expel John Kotelawala [Snr] from the management of properties belonging to other three children, as she considered him to be disloyal to the rest of the heir to the estate; her three other children, and also was suspicious that he was planning to take over the management in full from young brother-in-law Francis Dixon after Johns retirement from Police.
Francis left Wesley College at the age of 16, but he was too immature and inexperienced apart from being a legal minor to take over the management from the veteran police officer brother-in-law. The mother of Artygalles made a special representation through her lawyers to the colonial Governor requesting the use of Governors powers to grant his son Francis Dixon, a minor at the time, conferred with, Letters of Venia Aetatis, [entitling the minor to the rights and liabilities of a person of full age under Roman Civil Law] making him a major; which the Governor obliged.
Kotelawala on his own decided to assist the management of Kahatagaha mines owned by Artygalles including his wife Alice, and managed by Francis his brother-in-law, by visiting the mines with Singhoni and few other loyalists on a regular basis. On one such occasion, as designed by Francis, when Kotelawela and his men were within the perimeters, a large gathering of workers and people from the area all supporters of young man came to attack them; they heckled, jeered and finally detained Kotelawala and Sergeant Singoney in a nearby house. Singhoni, particularly and singularly was victimized as he resisted the move.
At the intervention of a friend of both parties they were subsequently released from detention after being in captivity for one full day. Kotelawela who did not have a strong or unreasoning desire for revenge did not take this humiliation seriously though with disgrace and fury, he openly declared that Artygalle would be done away with soon in the presence of the gathering but did not retaliate immediately.
Income of enormous family estate
The second marriage of Artygalles Colamunne walawwa took place when Leena married civil engineer Theodore G Jayewardene. Theodore a member of the most prominent in professional class of Politico-Legal family of Jayewardenes based in the city. TG later became the first Ceylonese commanding officer of the Ceylon Light Infantry [CLI] and reached the rank of Colonel. TG was an elected member of the State Council from 1933 to 1936. Theodore had four brothers, all practicing lawyers including JR Jayewardenes father Eugene Wilfred Jayewardene [EW], the Kings Counsel and Judge of the Supreme Court who played a leading role in the review and comparison of the new Criminal Procedure Code. Kotelawala became suspicious of Artygalles after their association with Jayewardenes of Colombo a family of too many lawyers meant an obvious threat to his position and activities and the questionable way he handled the income of enormous family estate. His anger and bitterness of the union was exposed when he viciously decided to insult the grooms party at the wedding held at Colummune Artigalle Walawwa itself by making some highly disparaging remarks against the grooms party, the Jayewardenes. He also referred to them as Thambis. [TGs grandfather and JR Jayewardenes great-grandfather, Don Adrian Jayewardene served the Dutch rulers in the latter part of 18th Century as Tombi, meaning intelligence agent: and later under British as Tombi Mudaliar in charge of a group of Agents: the term Tombi was corrupted or misinterpreted as Thambi, a derogatory remark coined by racist elements to identify Moors or Muslims] Johns behaviour on this auspicious occasion angered Brides brother young Francis Dixon.
He was furious, quite natural for a youngster of his age, he could not control his temper and annoyance-Francis landed a thundering slap on Johns face in the presence of the gathering, which sealed his own fate and destiny.
Kotelawala warned the brother of his wife in his own inimitable manner saying, Remember, this is not the first time, mind you , you have dug your own grave, a threat to which most invitees present at the wedding bore witness to; but did not intend in proceeding beyond that. He decided to move away from interfering with Artygalle family fortunes and he launched a new company under the title, Ceylon-Japan Trading Co., for the purpose of engaging in import export trade with Japan. John Kotelawala then sailed to Japan in search of Plumbago importers in that country.
Singhoni Perera, the former Police sergeant now in retirement had a cousin named Baron Perera, with whom he related the story of John Kotelawala and his brother-in-law Francis Artygalle and the roles both of them, that is JK and Singhoni played in the management of Kahatagaha Mines. The saga about mocking, jeering and holding Singhoni and Kotelawala in custody overnight too was related to cousin Baron. Sergeant Singoney appeared to be very much disturbed, he did not take this humiliation trivially, and a desire for revenge was brewing in him. Baron was asked to search for a trustworthy assassin.
The name of the eldest daughter of Mudaliar Gemoris Artygalle, Alice, who married John Kotelawale [snr] was erroneously stated in a previous article. We regret the error.

Selections in a state of flux  does not augur well for World Cup
Not only is the administration of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) in total disarray but the disease has even spread to cricket selections where it has come to a stage where from the body language of the players it can be easily said that they have absolutely no faith in the system. It simply boils down to poor selection. Every player is playing to safeguard his place and as a result not playing as a team. It is very clear to see for any ordinary layman.
The crux of the problem lies with the head coach being inducted into the selection committee which is against the law of the country. The Sports Law clearly says that the selection committee across all sports should be an independent body where you only consult the coach and the captain and ask them to leave the room and then you pick the team. But here when that authority is given to the coach it is a matter of the dog doing the asss work.
What the authorities who run the game dont understand is that today the game has evolved to a level where each staff member and each official has clearly defined roles to play. The coachs job is to look after the technical side of the game, the batting coach should be getting our batsmen to score runs instead of talking about selections and the bowling coach, the fielding coach so on and so forth.
Chandika Hathurusingha and Thilan Samaraweera maybe good coaches but they are in a right royal pickle now. By taking the responsibility of selection on their heads they have messed it up totally. Samaraweera who is also the acting head coach due to the suspension on Hathurusingha said at the end of the third ODI: We have about 20 games for the World Cup. We have no idea who is going to bat where. We dont know who are going to be our top three batsmen. That statement alone sums up how clueless they are.
We seem to have all these fancy theories in the country that if you were a talented player you are an equally talented administrator. First, you need to identify the players, then identify in which position in the batting order they are best suited for but these people havent got the foggiest idea of how to get about this.
Take the third ODI at Pallekele. We win the toss and hand over that advantage to the opposition. South Africa got 363/7 and when we lost three wickets for 63 in the ninth over, Thisara Perera is sent up before Angelo Mathews. Now who is taking all these decisions When you are losing wickets you dont send a pinch hitter, but you try to consolidate.
In spite of losing early wickets we got up to 285. All we needed was two of our top order batsmen to score runs and we would have even chased the target down. You take Rabada out of this South African bowling the rest are all pedestrian bowlers, whom our batsmen could have taken to the cleaners. Dhananjaya de Silva who came to bat at no. 7 showed how easy it is to score runs off them.
What we are failing to identify is that South Africa has come here without their main strike bowler in leg-spinner Imran Thahir. Just imagine if he was in the line-up we would have not got close to the totals we have made. The third ODI was a classic example of our support staff not being competent at this level. The sole purpose of a support staff is to support the team. Is that happening
Where they have got themselves in a pickle is having Hathurusingha in the selection committee where he is hijacking the selections. What will happen is he will get into confrontation with the players and the moment that happens the plot is lost. As humans we are emotional. The moment the player is left out, the natural human reaction is to take offence. Once you take offence on the coach in one instance, it clouds the whole picture and the coach will never be the same thereafter.
Therefore the support staff should be protected from interfering with selections because as support staff their job is to support the team, selections should be done by an independent committee and all the anger and frustrations of the players can be directed at them instead of creating tension within the team environment where unlike the selectors the support staff are together.
You cannot have a coach involved in selection because it is against the law of the land. We are flouting the law of the land despite having a Presidents Counsel sitting as Sports Minister.
There is no desire to bring in an interim committee and clean the place up because they are playing politics. It seems that Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapha is there with a sole mandate to protect Thilanga Sumathipala. So until this government changes nothing is going to happen - this caravan will go on until the World Cup.
How can you go to the World Cup with players like Upul Tharanga and Prabath Jayasuriya Anyone can see how ridiculous it is from outside. Who are picking these guys One gets the impression that Sumathipala is manipulating everything from behind the scene. All the selections as it appears he is dictating. In this kind of scenario there will never be integrity in the selections. The moment you degrade the integrity of selections everything is lost. As you see the disaster is unfolding before our very eyes.
Unless there is integrity in the selections you will never get the best out of players, they will always be doubtful about the system and they will always play to safeguard their positions. And when the players start doing that the team will never prosper.

Wildlife & Nature Protection Society Public Lecture
SHELTERING  UNDER THE  LEOPARDS UMBRELLA
In a time of increasing human  animal conflict, mainly due to unplanned development, we are now faced with the unthinkable, the possible extermination of species that have lived on this island for thousands of years. Until the last few decades, they have lived in co-existence with humans, thanks to the culture of tolerance and respect for life that underpinned the philosophy and values of this Nation. Alas, no more. They are being driven to the very edge of extinctionthat is unless something is done about it, and soon. If these species are to be preserved for posterity, then science must lead the way to show how this can best be achieved, in present-day Sri Lanka.
One such creature is the Leopard. In addition to its ecological importance as the islands apex predator, it fulfils two important conservation roles:
1. High profile and charismatic, it is a Flagship Species which can be used to rally support for conservation, and
2. Wide-ranging across multiple habitat types it is a useful Umbrella species with the potential to shelter a much wider array of more spatially-restricted species.
For these reasons leopard conservation is of major importance.
A large scale analysis of leopard habitat suitability in Sri Lanka has indicated that the dominant factors influencing continued leopard persistence across the landscape are protection level and forest patch size, complexity and connectivity. Increasing habitat fragmentation in Sri Lanka, in the context of post-war development, means that identifying and maintaining connections between known leopard populations is imperative. This can be accomplished by improving our understanding of leopard range use and extent as well as resource utilization patterns which will enable targeting specific areas for more focused conservation action. This is a necessity for an islandwith awidespread, high density human population experiencingrapid development and yet retaining a sizable area of mixed habitat wilderness. This approach will also enable a wider suite of biodiversity to gain protection under the leopards ecological umbrella. A case study of such a proposal from the highly fragmented landscapes of the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka will be showcased at this talk.
This understanding has been developed by Dr. Andrew Kittle and Anjali Watson who have, in recent times, been foremost in field research on wild leopards in Sri Lanka.
Their observations, and analysis of them, have contributed much in understanding what is required now, to preserve the leopard in the wilds of Sri Lanka for future generations to marvel at.
Dr. Andrew Kittle is a Zoologist who, in addition to conducting research on the Sri Lankan leopard, has studied the behaviour and spatial ecology of large carnivores across systems and continents including wolves in North America, and lions and hyenas in Eastern Africa.
Anjali Watson is an ecologist whose work includes examining the factors that underlie the island-wide distribution and mortality of the Sri Lankan leopard. She has also worked with primates in South America and Sri Lanka, and worked alongside Andrew on his other carnivore research.
Both Andrew and Anjali have been members of the IUCNs international Cat Specialist Group since 2002 and are the assessors for the Sri Lankan leopard subspecies, as well contributing assessors for the fishing cat and rusty spotted cat. Their research has been published internationally and their Sri Lankan leopard study is what informs the IUCNs Global Red List of threatened species status for Pantheraparduskotiya. Their work was recently recognized via a Whitley Award, a high profile conservation award for their research on leopards in the unprotected Central Highlands of Sri Lanka.

SL on course for US$ 17.5 bn export target for 2018
Sri Lanka is on course to reach the 2018 export target of US$ 17.5 billion set up by the government, said Chairperson, Export Development Board, Indira Malwatte.
Speaking at the Messe Frankfurt Exhibition of Germany event held in Colombo she said that Sri Lanka has already achieved 60% of that target by end of July 2018.
She said the government has set up an export target of US$ 20 billion revenue for 2019 and 23 billion for 2020 end. The export target set for 2020 is US$ 28 billion and these targets are now falling in line and are achievable. She also said that unlike some other countries, Sri Lanka does not include and add revenue generated from tourism to export revenue.
Malwatte also said that today Sri Lankan export trends are shifting from merchandise to service oriented exporters. I am sure service exporters would overrun the Merchandise exporters in two years.
She said that the service sector is being dominated by BPO services, ICT and logistics sectors.
This is why the Singapore and Sri Lanka FTA would be very advantageous for Sri Lanka as it would help to promote the servicer sector even higher. She said that like everybody united to defeat terrorism today people must rally round the exporters and give maximum assistance to them as exports and FDI are the key to economic growth.
Malwatte added that the proposed China Sri Lanka FTA too would help to woo more Chinese investors to Sri Lanka as it would be easier for them to manufacture in Sri Lanka and export back to Chine avoiding the taxes that are imposed on local manufacturing. Secondly Chinese manufactures can also take advantage of the Indo Lanka FTA and export to India and then to Pakistan.
Commending Messe Frankfurt organized global exhibitions she said that four Sri Lanka apparel manufactures participated at the 2017 Ambiente event in Paris along with four fashion designers and this year more would participate.
Messe Frankfurt CEO of Sri Lanka, Omer Salahuddin said that they are happy with the participants of Sri Lanka for the last years event and they are also hoping attract more form the 2018 event which would be held in Paris in September and their other events.
With 800-year experience, Messe Frankfurt is today one of the global leaders in the fair industry while generating sales of about  661 million and more than  271 million sales was generated outside Germany.
Sri Lankan companies participate in Paperworld in Frankfurt and Dubai; Ambiente (Frankfurt), Intersec in Dubai and Automechanika fairs in Dubai, Frankfurt and Istanbul. We are now planning to open a regional office in Colombo next December.

Smart Crop Protection System to keep off wild animals
A new invention called the Smart Crop Protection System (SCPS) has been introduced to protect cultivations from wild animals.
The invention, introduced by Dr. Sarath Wimalasooriya and electronic engineer Achala Uthsuka, is an electric fencing system.
The Agriculture Ministry has distributed 25 SCPSs to farmers in the first model agricultural village in Haputale, Kahattewela.
Farmers in Kahattewela had appreciated the attempt and according to them, the system was highly successful. The country loses around 30 - 40 percent of the agricultural harvest annually due to wild animals, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Agriculture Ministry had received several requests from farmers to find a solution to the issue of crops being destroyed by wild animals such as elephants, monkeys, wild boar, porcupines and peacocks, said the minister.
However, the government cannot kill any animal but alternative solutions are needed to address this problem, he said.

Sri Lanka to host IronMan70.3 Colombo in February 2019
The most iconic high profile international triathlon event IronMan 70.3 Colombo will be staged for the second consecutive year in Sri Lanka on February 24, 2019. The official licencee of the World Triathlon Corporation and owner of the IronMan global triathlon brand in Sri Lanka, ProAm Serendib will conduct the event in collaboration with Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau and the Ministry of Tourism.
The first edition of IronMan 70.3 Colombo was a success and took place in the country early this year attracting over 880 participants and around 2,300 friends and families from 63 countries.
This challenging event will start with a 1.9 km open water swim off Galle Face Green, followed by a 3-lap flat 90 km bike leg through the Colombo Port and ending with a 21.1 km run passing through some of Colombos landmarks and finishing at Galle Face Green.
Athletes enjoyed the races where they were exposed to flawless tropical weather conditions whilst enjoying some of the islands most spectacular views en route.
A majority of the participants were recorded from Europe with 40 percent having taken part in the first edition while other participants hailed from countries such as the USA, Canada, Middle East, Australia, African countries and North East and South East Asian countries.
Pro-Am Serendib is geared to hold this prestigious international sporting event in Sri Lanka and it happens to be the only IronMan event in the South Asian region. It provides an opportunity to build local capability and capacity to host international multisport endurance sporting events in Sri Lanka.
IronMan triathlon is a global phenomenon with a 40-year history going back to Hawaii. During an awards banquet, a few athletes debated which athletes were the fittest: Swimmers, Bikers or Runners. Later, US Naval Commander John Collins and his wife Judy decided to combine the 3 toughest endurance races in Hawaiithe 2.4 mile (3.8 km) Waikiki Rough water Swim, 112 miles (180 km) Around-Oahu Cycle Race and the 26.2mile (42.2 km) Honolulu Marathoninto one event.
On Feb.18, 1978, 15 competitors, including Collins, came to the shores of Waikiki to take on the first-ever IronMan challenge. Since the first ever race, the IronMan World Championship race is held in Hawaii in October each year. It is the number one user-based sports brand in the world, with 15 billion media impressions for the IronMan World Championship, a global audience of over 6,000,000 spectators, over 250,000 athletes representing 200 countries, participating at over 250 IronMan branded events globally, which include IronMan and the IronMan 70.3 series.

Yellow eye makeup has created quite a storm on the runways ever since it debuted.
This trend is based on the fact that variations of yellow have appeared in many eye shadow palettes over the past few months. Yellow eye makeup has created quite a storm on the runways ever since it debuted. Heres how you can create a beautiful look using just a few eye-shadows.
How to get the look
Use a primer over your eyelids and let it set.
Add a soft brown shade to the socket using a blending brush. Blend well to create a light shadow.
Using the same brush, add an orange shade over the brown and blend it into the socket and the outer third of the eyes.
Apply a highlight shade on the brow bone to make the look seamless
Using a flat brush, apply yellow shadow all over the lids, and into the inner corner blending it well into the orange and brown shades.
Make sure to blend it all together for that beautiful, transitioned and halo effect on the eyes.
Apply a brown/black liner on the water line and on the lash line. This will make the colours on the eyes stand out.
Curl your lashes and apply two coats of mascara.
Keep the rest of the face simple. Apply a highlighter for that added glow. For lips, apply a neutral shade and a shimmery gloss.

Super-politicised underworld
Until and unless political parties stop patronizing both the underworld and powerful economic elite in sponsoring elections, law enforcement is only wishful thinking. This whole process consequently makes Legislative power ineffective in the countrys governance.
The legislative membership becomes subservient to these two corrupt institutional agencies for propping them up in high office and in turn politicians remain eternally obliged to them to the extent to which, should those in these two corrupt mechanisms violate the law, legislative power becomes non-operational not only to end up a lame duck but also a dead one as well where peoples sovereignty is undermined. This is nothing new to this country alone but has become an international malaise.
That the massive American cartels propel US governments into hot seats is not only public knowledge but infants as well. One look at whats happening in the US tells it all. The moral leadership in the US as elsewhere is no more. History repeats they say, but the repetition of moral governance in the like of Woodrow Wilson, Eisenhower, Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln is unlikely - none of whom Sri Lanka has ever produced nor ever will. If ever there was such a single Sinhala Buddhist only Dr. E.W. Adikaram could lay claim to such but unfortunately he hiccupped at the thought of making headway in Sri Lankas political scene. It was not his favourite past-time to keep embracing the jatiya aagama cry for in such reference Dr. Adikaram saw the wrenching of his soul as he detested tunnel vision having connected himself with a nobler objective. The parallel of him we see in Speaker Karu Jayasuriya but the Malaysian populace still endorse Mahathir Mohammed at 92 and do not distance age and integrity. It was not to be that Speaker Jayasuriya be amidst an enlightened citizenry as the Malaysians where integrity over age is much sought after. Perhaps we lack the third eye that is Malaysias irresistible fortune.
Todays urgency, therefore, warrants the need to identify moral leadership over chronological years and the total alienation of corrupt politicians. That it took a biracial Black African girl carrying slavery in her genes like Meghan Markle to ostracize this set of international political hooligans at her nuptials needs to be reiterated and the symbolic message it carries internationally but this writer sees no endeavour by even world-renowned journalists to highlight this much overlooked but unceasingly significant point.
Englands constitutional monarchy
Even the much respected British journalist Piers Morgan looks the other way when he could even deliver reason this subject. Maintaining political goodwill apparently has come to stay and whats intolerable is when the media resorts to such.
What better way to isolate corruption and moral meandering than this, the moral shot that came off the latest addition to the Windsor membership Meghan not only set many corrupt international power elite thinking, but she also led the British monarch into remaking the moral wrong of that infamous nod that the queen would give acknowledging their presence at the many celebrations in Buckingham Palace let alone inviting them there. Meghans decision to even throw overboard the wishes and aspirations of Englands constitutional monarchy is a display of her moral spunk against worldwide political debauchery.
Democratic theories of government remain so and practice in limbo state as the underworld progressively gains control of the world  Sri Lanka no exception. This is no recent development. For decades, the citizenry has gone through moral decadence but never so intense as in recent times. Political theories such as democracy and sovereignty of the people are only made use of to license the irregularities and continue to be a faade.
Likewise, immorality reigns under the cover of law. For instance, COPE that was appointed to investigate corruption comprised some members who were themselves corrupt. Former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake was presented before a committee of Rajapaksa henchmen. Resonant is the Sinhala expression: naduth hamuduruwange baduth hamuduruwange. If at all honest men like STF commandant Latiff are appointed, it will be with the curtailment of power. He has to hand over the miscreant to the police and thereafter the political thug bribes the relevant police officer. Latiffs integrity ends there! This is moral licensing of the underworld.
The legislative power is viewed as a money-spinning reservoir. The "rata jatiya" cry has become the canard to achieving a political clout. Even the judiciary is not spared of political influence to cover up political expedience. Sarath Silva, the former judicial head, is on record for proclaiming publicly his judgmental delivery in favour of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Thavarapperuma conducts lessons to STF officers on the need to come in uniform when on a raid and that the confiscation of phones was an intrusion of privacy choosing to ignore STFs rights to do so. The underworld attempts to even make new laws in addition to using existing ones to suit them! Debunking the independence of the three arms of government and the politicization that followed in 1972 by the constitutional architect, Dr. Colvin R de Silva undermined the peoples sovereignty, an essential component of democratic government.
Key factors contributed to making Democracy and peoples sovereignty redundant elements worldwide and particularly so in Sri Lanka. The progressive rise of the underworld and powerful economic elite backing political power and the politicized 1972 Constitution did not favour a moral government. The noble ideals embedded in a democratic government has lost colour. Elections only change governments and have become a swap into corruption as one bunch of deceitful self-serving individuals are replaced by another. A mismatch between the peoples wants and what a corrupt legislature has to offer exists. Yet the danger element is in the steady increase in the social acceptance of fraud.
Army and judiciary in Pakistan
Contrastingly, in Pakistan, the army and judiciary intervene to take care of democracy. Elected leaders, when corrupt, have been removed by the judiciary and the army gains control, establishes democracy, upholds the peoples sovereignty and reverts to its earlier position. The press, they say, are the nations watchdogs. This ought to be the reverse in Pakistan where both army and judiciary have taken on that role. Running to perfection in Pakistan is the theory of checks and balances. Its Chief Justice Nizar is believed to be like a king rendering such stately judgements. His inspection tours of hospitals are noteworthy and a fillip to this theory when judicial concern is more weighted in the peoples interests with a hawks eye on the executives functioning.
The only way out to fight corrupt politicians is a strong judiciary, a vibrant press and an effective civil society. It could be argued that the army overthrow of governments is illegitimate -the frequent occurrence of which we see in Pakistan. However, as defamation is permitted in public interest Pakistans military leadership intervenes by way of moral coups to fight corrupt political leadership in the absence of a third force, upholds democracy and peoples sovereignty and retreats no sooner elections are held.
Constitutional enactments that violate peoples sovereignty are often pronounced. Isnt corruption a stab in the back of the very people that elect governments into power whereby the peoples sovereignty is undermined Diametrically opposed to corruption are the attempts made by some who fervently walk the moral path to reconciliation. Yet very little is heard of such. For example, Sri Lanka Armys star-studded Colonel Priyath Bandus reach out to the Tamil people in the north is a shining example. The reservoir of goodwill he invited from the Tamil people would suffice to teach the politicians what it means to be sincere when all what they know is to use the underworld and the potbellied rich business fraternity to work towards consolidating the future of even unborn generations! Regretfully, no scribes fist was sufficiently focused into colonel Bandus unique endeavour.

Switzerland, Sri Lanka ties strengthened
Swiss Justice Minister, Simonetta Sommaruga has agreed an extended migration partnership accord with Sri Lanka.
On Monday, Sommaruga signed a Memorandum of Understanding in Colombo with Interior Minister Seneviratne Bandara Nawinne reaffirming cooperation, according to the Justice Ministry.
Sommaruga said Switzerland will increase its support to Sri Lanka to promote democratic reform, a ministry statement said.She said the migration partnership set conditions to strengthen human rights and create better prospects for young people in Sri Lanka through vocational training projects. Sommaruga met President Maithripala Sirisena and ministers and representatives of the National Human Rights Commission and several civil society organisations including members of the strongest political party, the Tamil National Alliance.
During her four-day trip to Sri Lanka, she will look into labour migration programme led by the Swiss Agency to develop external link.
The visit will gain first-hand information on the reconciliation process following the end of the 30-year civil war in 2009 and the rule of law in the country, notably the labour migration to Gulf States and Asian countries.
In 2016, Switzerland and Sri Lanka signed a bilateral immigration treaty covering the repatriation of Sri Lankans who no longer fulfill the conditions for continued residence in Switzerland.
The non-governmental Swiss Refugee Council external link and the Swiss branch of Amnesty International external link have criticised the planned cooperation accord with Sri Lanka.
They said the reconciliation process in Sri Lanka was not sufficiently advansed and the human rights situation in the country was too problematic for closer cooperation.Switzerland offered shelter to thousands of refugees. About 51,000 Sri Lankans are in Switzerland. Half of them have acquired Swiss citizenship, according to the Jjustice Ministry.- Swissinfo

Tennis star Serena Williams struggling with postpartum emotions
Los Angeles, Tuesday: Serena Williams says she is suffering from "postpartum emotions" as the 23-time Grand Slam winner struggles to deal with juggling family life and tennis.
The 36-year-old American is seeking to regain her top form after missing most of the 2017 WTA season due to a pregnancy.
"I read several articles that said postpartum emotions can last up to three years if not dealt with," Williams said on Monday.
Williams' disclosure comes a week after she suffered the worst loss of her career in San Jose, losing the final 12 games in a shocking 6-1, 6-0 first-round upset to unseeded Johanna Konta.
On Monday, she described her mindset at the time as being in a "funk".
"Last week was not easy for me. Not only was I accepting some tough personal stuff, but I just was in a funk. Mostly, I felt like I was not a good mom," Williams wrote on her social media Instagram account. Williams said she is trying to work through her despair by sharing her feelings with family and friends.
"Talking things through with my mom, my sisters, my friends let me know that my feelings are totally normal. It's totally normal to feel like I'm not doing enough for my baby .... Whether stay-at-home or working, finding that balance with kids is a true art," she said.
Organizers announced on Saturday that Williams was withdrawing from this week's WTA Montreal tournament citing "personal reasons".
Williams battled back from life-saving surgery after giving birth to daughter Olympia in September, reaching the final at Wimbledon, where she was beaten by Germany's Angelique Kerber.
Williams had a tough draw in Montreal. Her opening match would have been against Frenchwoman Alize Cornet who has defeated Williams four out of the six times they have faced each other. If she advanced past Cornet, her next opponent would have been Kerber.
Meanwhile, in first round matches on Monday, Serena's older sister Venus rallied from an early break down to ease into the second round by defeating world number 124 Caroline Dolehide 7-5, 6-1.
"I think maybe she had more of an advantage because she's probably seen me play more than I've played her. It was pretty close in the first set," the 38-year-old Venus said.
Venus used her experience to wrestle control of the match as she hit 12 winners and made 16 unforced errors. Dolehide tried to make the most of her baseline game but she racked up 25 unforced errors to 11 winners, and lost her serve four times.
Venus next faces the winner of an all-Romanian encounter between qualifier Monica Niculescu and 2013 tournament runner-up Sorana Cirstea.
Maria Sharapova and Sesil Karatantcheva, of Bulgaria, renewed their teenage rivalry but were only able to complete the first five games before the rains hit.
Russia's Sharapova has a 4-1 lead in the match which will resume on Tuesday.
The pair played their first three career matches as teenagers, including a fiery affair on the outer courts at the 2004 Indian Wells tournament when Karatantcheva was 15. Tuesday's contest under the Court Central lights will be their first in over eight years. Because of the rain, their match was one of several that will be added to an already busy Tuesday calendar.

Thamba Villas Thalpe to open by 2020
Tamba Villas set in a private coconut estate which is set back 300 meters from Thalpe beach Galle, estimated to be around late 2020.
Eduard Hempel and Trevor Morgan Director and Co-Project Principals for Tamba Villas said that they expect to commence construction of this niche development project in early 2019.
The 37 villas, has been designed by an award-winning Singaporean Architectural team, to create a coastal lifestyle design with high-end amenities for living, working or early retiring in a much sought-after area in the south of Sri Lanka. The total investment would be US$ 15 million.
Tamba Villas is a collaboration between Shakticola and Award-winning A D Lab, a Singaporean Architectural firm focused on cutting edge residential projects, while STIX, another award-winning landscape designer designed the lush tropical gardens.
The Tamba team wanted to build a development that did not overwhelm the landscape, instead ensuring that each Villa blends in sensitively around all the greenery, preserving the natural surrounding beauty, said Hempel.
Plans are also in place for a Business Centre, a visiting licensed doctor and a visiting beautician, while many other amenities will be added accordingly.
He said that Sri Lankan Parliament ratified an amendment to the laws so that foreigners can buy Freehold in a condominium development. This is Great news for foreign investors, says Hempel.
Previously, foreigners could only buy Freehold from the fourth floor up and consequently Sri Lankans were wary of buying the lower floors since they couldnt sell them to foreigners. This was having the effect of bending new buildings out of shape all over Colombo, as developers dedicated the first four floors to car parking.
We are incredibly excited, as we are just going into market our Condominium/Villa development in Thalpe, and it is the first of its kind in the Country. Our timing couldnt be better! Foreigners can now own their Free-hold, which opens up the doors globally.

Three output canals and gates of the Beira Lake located near the Court Complex, McCallum Gate and the Presidential Secretariat which were temporally closed will be reconstructed and opened to contain the stench which pervades the air in Colombo city, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The Minister addressing a media briefing yesterday said a new project has commenced to dredge the mud and sewerage which have been blocking the Beira Lake for the past five to six decades.
Although the Beira Lake is legally owned by the Ports Authority,permission to maintain and clean its water body has been given to the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation & Development Corporation.
Colombos sewerage system was built during the British Colonial period,but,it has not been developed in parallel with the increase in population and other development activities in Colombo city. The sewerage system is obsolete and we hope to transform the Beira Lake from its present state to a worthy centerpiece in a revitalised city, once the project is complete, Minister Ranawaka added.

TWO REPARATIONS BILL CLAUSES INCONSISTENT: SC
The Supreme Court has determined that two Clauses of the Office for Reparations Bill are inconsistent with the Constitution, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament yesterday.
The Speaker, making an announcement at the commencement of the sittings, said that the SC in its determination sent to Parliament after concluding the hearing of two petitions challenging the Bill has stated that Clause 27(a) and 27 (a) iii are inconsistent with the Constitution.
The SC has ruled that the Bill has either to be passed with two thirds majority in Parliament and a referendum or be amended as per the SCs recommendations to make it consistent with the Constitution.
The Bill provides for the provision of individual and collective reparations for aggrieved persons. The Clause 27 (a) deals with the interpretation of aggrieved persons. The Clause 27 (a) says aggrieved persons mean persons who have suffered a violation of human rights or humanitarian law, their relatives and missing persons. The Clause 27 (a) iii interprets that aggrieved persons also include the individuals, groups or communities of people of Sri Lanka who had faced systematic gross violations of the rights.
If the above two clauses are amended as per the SCs recommendations those will cease to be inconsistent with the Constitution. The SC has determined that the rest of the provisions in the Bill are in accordance with the Constitution.
The Bill was presented in Parliament for the first reading on July 17.
The scope of legislation applies to the conflict in the North and the East, as well as any political unrest or civil disturbance, systematic gross violations of the rights of individuals, groups or communities of people of Sri Lanka, and enforced disappearances.
Under the individual reparations, the bill facilitates any monetary payment or material benefit provided to an aggrieved person, micro-finance and concessionary loans, educational programmes, training, and skills development programmes, administrative assistance, and welfare services including psycho-social support provided to an aggrieved person, measures of restitution, including the provision of land and housing, and other appropriate measures identified by the Office for Reparations.
Under the Collective reparations, the bills facilitates remembrance of deceased persons, including memorials, development of infrastructure, educational programmes, training, and skills development programmes, community development programmes or services, and other appropriate programmes as identified by the Office of Reparations in consultation with affected communities.
The Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority Act, No. 29 of 1987 will be repealed by the new Bill.

## Title: Uniqueness of judges

Uniqueness of judges
The other day we made the point in these spaces that the judges of the higher courts may take exception to their lot being treated on par with members of parliament, anent increasing the salaries of MPs to the level of judicial officers. This is, given that, over one third of our legislators were found to have not passed their GCE (O/L)s. Yesterday, our argument was endorsed by the Finance Ministry in that there could be no comparison drawn between judges and other officials of the public sector.
Issuing a statement, the ministry states that on January 9 this year a decision was taken by the Cabinet to treat judicial officers as a unique category when determining their salaries and other facilities. Ditto for the Attorney General's Department and Legal Draftsman's Department. It was also pointed out that the officers working in these three services (Judiciary, AG's Department and Legal Draftsman's Department) have wide open opportunities to earn in ample measure were they not tied down to these departments and work in their private capacities. Hence, in order to attract them and retain them in these departments the judicial officers were placed on a unique salary scale which cannot be claimed by other officials in the public sector. For this reason the Cabinet decision made on January 9 nullified the resolution of 2006 that brought MPs salaries on par with judges of the higher courts.
No right thinking person can find fault with this reasoning. Like doctors, who start at Medical College and go through internships over a long period of time, it takes a long process for a judge to arrive at where he/she is, beginning with Law College, acting as juniors in the chambers of leading lawyers, practicing in the lower courts, becoming magistrates and eventually graduating to the higher courts.
In contrast, a MP has quite an easy passage, not requiring any educational qualifications or other special aptitudes other than having the talent to ingratiate themselves to their party leaders, and, above all, the ability to display muscle power to bring the votes for their respective parties and the expertise to bellow the kind of rhetoric that will appeal to the baser instincts of the uneducated masses, particularly if they are of the patriotic variety.
Judges are also unique in other ways. A judge has not only to suffer himself the laborious process of presiding over long drawn out cases but also has to write copious judgements which would put to test his integrity. An MP, on the other hand, is not burdened with such onerous responsibilities and does not have to worry about his/her integrity, going by the political somersaults effected with gay abandon by our people's representatives.
Members of the judiciary also come from vastly different backgrounds to that of some of our politicians. Many of them take up the profession following in the family tradition and thus are heirs to a long line of legal luminaries within the family. Hence, it is out of the question to treat them on par with chain snatchers, cattle thieves, rapists and murderers as some of our parliamentarians have come to be described today.
Whomsoever hit on the bright idea of treating MPs on par with judges is not clear, though the resolution was brought when Mahinda Rajapaksa was President. Perhaps, it may have had its genesis on the devaluing of the role of the judiciary during this time and the powers that be seeing no reason why a judge should be any different to a run of the mill MP. This was also the time that the Attorney General's Department was under the Executive and was made to comply with orders to terminate the cases of government MPs arraigned on rape charges.
It was also during this period that the country's first lady Chief Justice was hounded out of office after being humiliated. It was also the time that the sitting President of the Court of Appeal was overlooked for promotion to the Supreme Court for making a ruling holding the ouster of the lady CJ illegal.
Hence, this contempt for members of the judiciary could well have had a co-relation in treating them on par with members of parliament.
Flogging a dead horse
One would have thought that the matter of the Leader of the Opposition had been thrashed out and done with many moons ago. However, the same argument proffered in the past that the JO has more numbers than the TNA in parliament and thus is entitled to appoint the Leader of the Opposition from among its own is put forward once again. The JO claims that with the exit of the 16 SLFP MPs from the government it now has 70 MPs and continues to insist that one of their members be made Opposition Leader. How can the advent of 16 SLFP MPs into the JO fold change the status quo It was a mere addition. Hence, the original ruling by the Speaker that the JO is part of the UPFA which is in government, still holds.

Waking up for the GOAL
Things are not easy for the new coach. He has to work hard to ignite the spirit of the children destined to tilling the earth in this distant hamlet. With an uncooperative principal and a bunch of uncompromising kids in tow, the new teacher almost throws in the towel. But the fate has other plans.
Goal is Maharaja Entertainments latest effort in the widescreen. Their recent series of films indicate how experimental they have been in the commercial film industry. With Dharmayuddhaya, things were quite much smooth sailing, as the film was a remake of a well-favoured murder thriller.
Its plot is full of suspense, hence absorbing. No entertainment freak would have missed the opportunity for a second-time watch. When it comes to A Level, the next movie produced by Susara Dinal for Maharaja Entertainment, the phenomenon changed.
In Sri Lanka, the commercial filmmakers cannot afford to perform feats that the Hollywood commercial filmmakers are privileged with.
The Hollywood filmmaker can fuse artistic elements into their commercial ventures, whereas in Sri Lanka the filmmaker is strictly required to switch to the populist elements.
A Level deals with a social issue which does not seem the right technique if you need to prosper in the Sri Lankan commercial film industry.
The recent trend has proved that the commercial success is very much reliant on a limited range of themes: religion, history and juvenile are three specific genres.
Universal timeline
With Goal, the producers experiment on the third genre. To achieve that end, the producers employ already used techniques and tactics in addition to their own innovative characterisation methodology.
The movie narrates the rags-to-riches tale of a bunch of village kids who rise to stardom with football. The subject seems most appropriate and timely. But what lies underneath is more interesting than the primary theme. The film questions the role of the modern teacher on a universal timeline through three major characters: Mr Samarasekara, his principal and his wife. The characterisation introduces the audience to many forms of the teacher's role split between the traditional and the modern conventions.
Mr Samarasekara (Jayalath Manoratne) has immense faith in extracurricular activities. That is the only way out for an impoverished community where illiteracy reigns to a cancerous proportion. On the other hand, the principal (Kaushalya Fernando) is a practical woman with a coarse attitude towards Mr Samarasekaras ideals. She is all too well familiar with the ground reality. The land is dry and parched to an extent where it is almost unrealistic to pour some water. In between (though not sandwiched) is Mr Samarasekaras wife (Chandani Seneviratne). Where Mr Samarasekara adopts a harsh approach to the village brats, Mrs Samarasekara reaches out to them with a soft feminine touch. Where Mr Samarasekara loses, Mrs Samarasekara gains.
Mr Samarasekara is often harassed by the harshness and callousness of the villagers (including the principal). The principal is affected by her own rough surroundings.
Mrs Samarasekara observes the race paced between her husband and the village. She is unperturbed to work out a soft, yet yielding, strategy to win over the hard-hitting villagers to her fold. The film could well be acclaimed as a work that offers motivation to the younger generation, but in fact, it offers an incredible lesson on how to win the toughness.
Demanding portrayal
Dr Jayalath Manoratne takes the lead in a well-performed cast. In both A Level and Goal, he is delegated with a demanding character portrayal. In A Level he had to play a paedophile masquerading as a gentleman, whereas Goal offers him the dare of breathing a true-to-life interpretation to a teacher cum football coach. When this writer posed him the blunt question as to how he managed to portray the role quite well, the actor offered an equally blunt response: YouTube. He claims to have observed the movements of football coaches on a number of YouTube posts and tried to copy them downright.
As usual, Rohan Perera demonstrates the mastery of storytelling. At first, the film rings a bit of a bell of the award-winning Ho Gana Pokuna. But halfway through we take in that the scriptwriter does not have to stoop that low with his imagination power.
Perera's mastery of storytelling is not new to the audience. He has already proved his mettle with A Level movie.
Like we have stressed a few paragraphs ago, Perera takes pains to portray the conventional teachers role from a different angle. While questioning the teachers role, Perera syringes a fresh lease of life to Mr and Mrs Samarasekara which the local filmgoer has not experienced so far in the local cinema.
They are both affectionate towards the village. They both need to change the village for the better, though the modus operandi varies.

They say Lanka has failed to implement the resolution and brazenly repudiated its commitments to the UNHRC and victims of the war, so far without consequence.
They further insist, in March 2018 UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein has also explicitly expressed his frustration, having lost faith in Lankas willingness to engineer transitional justice and has called on member states to explore other avenues, including the application of universal jurisdiction, that could foster accountability. The UN Deputy for Human Rights, Kate Gilmore called for the establishment of a Special Court So they are serious. However the government is also shown it wish to implement its commitments to the international community by appointing committed powerful people to relevant committees and commissions. In addition certain socio economic programmes are to be implemented specifically meant for oppressed women.
Non-consumption loans
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera has announced that the government would write off the non-consumption loans granted to women by all registered finance companies up to Rs. 100,000. He said the government had also decided to introduce an interest rate cap of 30 per cent per annum on all future loans given by microfinance companies.
The decision was taken by the Cabinet of Ministers, on the recommendation of the Minister Samaraweera. This scheme will initially be limited to women who have obtained microfinance loans for non-consumption purposes in the drought-affected districts of Trincomalee, Ampara, Batticaloa, Jaffna, Mulathivu, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Mannar, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa where cultivations were affected consecutively for five seasons, the minister said. This is laudable indeed. But, this is not a total wipe off of debt that is obvious.
It is a restructure. There will be a moratorium on some cases and the payback will be at lesser interest rates. And that is capped at 30 per cent! Also it is for non consumption loans.
It is very likely the Tamils in homeland area will not be able to repay loans at 30% until the democratic struggles in the north expand further.
It is true that struggle for land, demilitarization, finding the disappeared, release of political prisoners and justice for war crimes took a new turn with the new appointments who came under the fire of fascistic Mahinda camp. But still, inspite of strong words of new radical officials, unless HR activities under the OMP are won with political autonomy to mind their own business, poor people will be helpless. On the other hand, according to the minister, women who had obtained loans amounting to Rs 100,000 and below can apply for a complete write-off of the loan.
The General Treasury will reimburse the loss incurred by the microfinance companies for having written off the capital component of the loans. The government has allocated Rs 500 million for this year to initiate the reimbursement programme. The microfinance companies will have to absorb the interest component of the loans written off, he said.
Economic relief for women
The persons who are benefited by this debt relief programme will be included on a priority basis to provide new loan facilities launched under the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme with a maximum of a two-year grace period. Microfinance institutions are currently providing micro loans without collateral via a door-to-door strategy quoting high-interest rates starting from 40 per cent to 220 per cent per annum for women seeking economic relief and income generation sources.
When multiple loans are obtained under the microfinance scheme, people have to pay a much higher interest than the initial loan amount due to the higher interest premium. So the government has intervened in a timely manner to protect rural women from falling into a debt trap by imposing an interest rate cap of 30 per cent on future loans.
Contrary to what is often claimed, microcredits are not a way out of poverty; on the contrary they most often result in a greater deprivation and humiliation of their victims. On the Indian sub-continent 65 million people have taken on a microcredit, 90% are women. Worldwide, women count for 81% of microcredit users (112 million). After an enquiry among microcredit victims and militants acting in their defence, we present here some emblematic cases. We point out that we have been unable to meet any advocates of microcredits.
Contrary to the usual claim, (affirmation) that a small loan will permit the development of successful enterprising activities, in most cases the users have used microcredit to cover more imperative and immediate necessities such as rents, loans, costs of schooling or medical treatment. Microcredits in Sri Lanka have most often been granted to women without any income, say Eric Toussaint the famous social worker and his group who were active in Lanka recently.

WILD(E)  AT THE  WENDT
The night belonged to Oscar Wilde as he haunted the stage of Lionel Wendt when his presence was felt by most of us. Led by the impeccable dapper Danu Innaasithamby as the imploring Loro Goring in the IDEAL HUSBAND, every character was brilliantly portrayed, crisp, curt and knowledgeable that it was hard to pinpoint as to who stood out. Each and every character lived up professionally with mighty body language surpassing dialogue at certain points for sheer elaboration. Their interrelating to each other was smooth with a sense of understanding that I found no flow.
Expressions superseded veteran players of the past when this bunch of novices by adding youthful freshness. I have to be honest and say that Danu overshadowed all with his clear of his voice and dignified acting.
Naturally, the whole cast picked by Jith Pieris rose to the occasion. In the past I have seen a couple of plays and operas abroad like for instance, Phantom of the Opera and pondered how on earth Oscar Wilde be boarded on local theatre, was sceptical of the outcome, especially from novices.
Youthful brilliance
Lo and behind; what appeared before my eyes, sent shock waves. Never bargained for such sweet youthful brilliance. In Jith Pieris's hands, he had moulded, shaped from fresh clay to surface likes of Christopher Plummer, Rex Harrison, Maurice Chevalier and Audrey Hepburn etc.
Both plays were boarded in 1895. The Ideal Husband in January and The Importance of Being Earnest in February to a packed house at Haymarket Theatre and St. James Theatre in London and followed at the Lyceum in New York. Needless to say that the already shamed Oscar Wilde whose spirits were flagging, got the much-needed boost to his spirit after homosexual scandal.
Born in Dublin, Ireland on 16 October 1854 and died in Paris France on 30 November 1900, he was forty-six years old.
With his Victorian upbringing, Oscar rose fast and furious to become one of England iconic poets author playwright etc. Had his primary education at Portora Royal School, he majored at Trinity College (Dublin) and Magdalene College, Oxford.
Lifelong interest
Stood out brilliantly and ahead of his colleagues in journalism and dialogue. With Anglo- Irish intellectual parents, Oscar studied Greek literature, aesthetics, philosophy and the history of the Renaissance. Oscar though Protestant, retained a lifelong interest in Catholic theology and liturgy.
Unfortunately, his short life weighed him down with misery, unhappiness, litigation and finally shamed for homosexuality which he called upon himself by dragging the Marquess of Queensbury for prosecution for criminal libel. Marquess was the father of Oscar's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. The trial unearthed evidence that caused Oscar to drop his charges and led to his own arrest. He was found guilty and was jailed for two years. He died a broken man shamed in his own country that held him on a pedestal-
Oscar Wilde's finest literary contribution among many was The Picture of Dorian Gray, Salome (in French), The Ideal Husband, The Importance of Being Earnest, De Profund (written while in prison) and his last work before he died The Ballad of Reading Goad'.
JITH PEIRIS
How an emotional English classic was turned into a hilarious play full of wit and humour is commendable. Very few will dare take the risk or for that matter, the challenge. He is our own brilliant impresario who has done it. Scripted surreptitiously as not to lose the essences of the two plays, he whipped courage to use body language and cheeky dialogue and sent the audience wild with laughter
Harmony and amity to everything around him, a gentleman par excellence, genial and winsome, bright and cheerful in everything he is involved in. He is much more an individual than many masters of their art. A man of humble character who makes his presence feel.
The effort he went through on the not-so-big stage, made to look impressively double its size with Victorian dressings and authentic furniture, each and every detail however minute as some were, gave the feeling of walking into a Victorian chamber. The characters stood out with ease in the surrounding blending in natural mannerisms.
Outside, the street lights dimly lit caught my imagination. I am sure many felt that way.
The Spirit of English autumn had gathered and rose towards the heavens.

This will put a spring in your step
Guinness World Records announced the world's largest inflatable obstacle course which measures 1,625.72 feet long and is dubbed The Beast.
The record-keeping organization said The Beast, designed by Hold My Shoes and V-Formation, was officially measured after making its debut in Belgium last year.
The course, which features 60 challenge sections and five wipe-out obstacles at the end, is due to visit Britain for a three-day stay May 26 to 28 in Betteshanger Country Park near Deal, England. The obstacle course is also slated to visit Australia, Japan, Brazil and several other countries.
"We started off by making our first parts years ago based on a simple connector idea so we could easily attach new pieces.
After doing that, we just wanted to make new themes, so we decided to make each track unique, one of a kind," Hold My Shoes founder Benedikt De Vreese said. UPI

Bad weather could ruin Lankas attempt to salvage something out of series
Winning last two ODIs vital for Asia Cup preparations - Mathews
PALLEKELE, Tuesday: With the five-match ODI series already lost Sri Lanka will try to salvage something from the wreck when they take on the high riding South Africans in the fourth match at the Pallekele International Stadium today.
However apart from the South Africans who have been dominant so far in the series there is now the threat of rain around that could foil Sri Lankas chances of turning it around. Both teams were confined to practice in the indoor nets yesterday as there was intermittent rain from morning that kept the ground staff busy throughout the day as they tried to prepare the pitch for todays contest.
Quinton de Kock who will lead South Africa in the last two ODIs batting at the indoor nets at Pallekele International Stadium yesterday.  
South Africa certainly will be without their captain Faf du Plessis who has been ruled out of the rest of the tour with a shoulder injury and they are likely to give some of the players who have not had a game so far in the series by resting some of their seniors.
Under the circumstances Sri Lanka will be looking to seize the opportunity to squeeze out a much needed win which is long overdue having lost 11 ODI matches on the trot to South Africa since July 2014 at Hambantota.
Sri Lanka are not looking to make any big changes to their side as they want to give continuity to the players and as skipper Angelo Mathews pointed out they want to continue with a process they have began by preparing good batting tracks.
We started off something from the last game and we need to move forward day in day out. We will learn when we play on good wickets the bowlers and the batters will get exposed that is something that we have to deal with. It is something that we have to get better at, said Mathews at the pre-match press conference. We will continue to do what we have planned not shoving it away after one or two games this is a process and the guys will definitely learn going forward.
Sri Lanka are not looking at making too many changes to the team as they want continuity.
We have an opportunity to try a few combinations but at the same time continuity is also something that we are looking forward to with the same player playing going forward as we need to understand their roles and strengths, said Mathews who will be playing in his 200th ODI today. He will be the 14th Sri Lankan cricketer to achieve this milestone.
We will try to give opportunities to whoever who has not played so far but unfortunately I dont think we will be able to give everyone the opportunity. This is a learning process and we need to keep the same player as much as we can. We believe that playing on these wickets will certainly improve our cricket.
Now the team is beginning to understanding what is expected of them playing on good wickets. Its important to win games as well. We will try our very best to win the next two games its important before the Asia Cup and the England series, he said.
DE KOCK TO LEAD SA
Wicket-keeper/batsman Quinton de Kock has been entrusted with the captaincy to lead South Africa in the last two ODIs against Sri Lanka with JP Duminy to captain them in the one-off T20 International.
Coach Ottis Gibson confirmed that South Africa would be doing changes to their team now that they have secured the series.
The intention from the outset was to take a look at other players we have two games and we have that opportunity.
Obviously we have won the series and now we have the opportunity to look at a few more guys. We have not finalized who we are going to look at in the fourth ODI, but I am pretty sure we will make some changes, said Gibson.
Clearly we played better in ODIs than we did in the Tests.
We didnt bring too much baggage from the Test series to the ODIs. We came here with a clear understanding what we want to achieve as a team. We brought here a pretty inexperienced bowling attack and they have stood up very well to the task. Good to see some seniors getting into runs again, Gibson continued.
We have played pretty much the way we wanted to play. We were very clear to achieve what we wanted to achieve.
The last ten ODIs have been about getting ourselves ready for the World Cup. Faf (du Plessis) has gone from three to four and Reeza Hendricks has come and done very well at number three. We have left at home Imran Tahir in order to look at another spinner and Shamzi who has done well.
We still have to look at Keshav Maharaj who is our number one Test spinner. We have answered a lot of questions but theres lot more we could do, he said.
Gibson said winning the series 5-0 was no big deal for South Africa because their priorities are a lot higher than that.
We want to keep improving as a team. We brought a young and inexperienced team. I suppose we didnt expect to win 5-0. But we have the opportunity and I can assure you that we will be trying to. We still have our priorities a lot higher than winning 5-0. Our priorities are giving other players an opportunity, Gibson said.

Worlds first  melt-proof  popsicle
Everyone loves ice-cream to beat the heat but the only trouble with them is that they can melt quickly when temperatures soar. Everyone who craves ice-candies in summer must have wished at some point that they could enjoy it them for a long time without melting.
Now culinary specialists Bompas and Parr have come up with an ice-lolly that can last for hours more than conventional popsicles in the same temperature. The inspiration behind this is a frozen material made with sawdust and wood pulp in ice that was meant to build an iceberg for a floating runway during World War Two.
The duo replaced sawdust and wood pulp with edible fruit fibres and the result can be called a dream come true for ice-lolly lovers. They are currently working on developing a product for supermarkets and it may be available soon.
The delightful invention will be showcased as part of a food exhibition to be held in London in September. ANI
