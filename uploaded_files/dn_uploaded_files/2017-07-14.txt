A TALL TALE: Former BoI Chairman Upul Jayasuriya responds.....
The following is former Board of Investment Chairman Upul Jayasuriya's response to the Daily News article on July 11, 2017 about the agreement between the BOI and Al Aman World Capital Centre.
The Daily News is withholding comment because Mr. Jayasuriya has since resigned.
"Application was received by the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI).
The summary of the proposed project as stated in the Application is as follows:-
World Capital Centre will stand the tallest among other infrastructural marvels in Sri Lanka gracing a height of 625 meters and consisting of 117 floors as major mixed development project.
Proposed project will be located within the commercial capital of Sri Lanka.
The building will house a hotel, business center, luxury residential and service apartments, leisure and recreational areas.
Based on the Board paper submitted by the Executive Director (Investment Promotion) through the Director General of the BOI, the Board approved in principle, the investment proposal by the name "World Capital Centre" funded by the TU - E Capital Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., valued at US $ 2.4 Billion to be invested over a period of six years, which will in its entirety consist of Foreign Investment.
The Investor having deposited an initial sum of US $ 2 million in a State Bank designated for the proposed investment project, the BOI entered into a preliminary Agreement incorporating and imposing a number of conditions was executed with Al-Aman World Capital Centre Limited.
The said conditions included in the said agreement are as follows:

1. " Para 6; The agreement is subject to the condition inter alia that the Enterprise shall acquire good title to / good leasehold interest in the land / site and submit a copy of the title deed / instrument of lease as the case may be, to the Board within three (03) months from the date hereof.
2. .....The enterprise shall enter into a supplementary agreement having obtained the necessary approval and / clearances referred to in Clause (13) of this Agreement and until such time the Enterprise shall not be entitled to duty free imports referred to in sub clause (iv) of Clause (11) hereof, under this agreement.

3. .....Failure to comply with the above shall invalidate the Agreement and this agreement shall thereupon absolutely be determined and the Enterprise shall forfeit all amounts paid to the Board.

4. " para 7(11); ......... Presales advances collected from the buyers shall not be considered as a part of the investment in the determination of concessions granted by the Board.

5. ...... 7(111) in order to assure the commitment towards implementing the project, the enterprise shall require to remit United States Dollars Two Hundred Million (US$ 200 Million) to Sri Lanka on or before the 31st December 2017. However, in the event that such remittance is not made as stipulated herein, the project shall stand terminated ipso facto."

6. This project will not be entitled for any Tax concession as at date and the provisions of the Inland Revenue Law shall be applicable to the enterprise in respect of the profits and the income generated through the approved activities.
The investor in order to proceed with the proposed investment project is required to fulfill all of the above conditions.
Failure to comply with the said conditions will in effect render the said Agreement null and void.
There was no commitment on the part of the BOI in the procurement of the land.
The BOI is the principle agency mandated to promote and facilitate FDI as empowered under the BOI Act of 1978.
We as a country and the BOI have to be positive.
We are not a regulatory authority. It is the role of the BOI to attract and facilitate investments as empowered by the BOI Law.
There are however other regulatory bodies in the system of governance that have been established to play such a regulatory role. In an instance where the prospective investor expresses an interest to invest in Sri Lanka, it is the duty of the BOI to do its utmost to facilitate such an investment.
We cannot afford to take a negative attitude. Given the challenging global environment where we are place 110 out of 190 countries as per the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, it is a challenge to attract investment, particularly when no tax concessions are offered while all the countries competing for the FDI in this region continue to offer such incentives.
By the execution of this agreement, neither the BOI not the country has been disadvantaged by any means.The company is not placed in an advantageous position either.
However skepticism that has been created would not only jeopardise this investment, but also have a negative impact on other prospective investments."

Democracy hinges upon majority opinion sans injustice of minority
Democracy means the use of the majority opinion in a manner that does not cause injustice to the minority. The vision of the Elections Commission is to ensure a nation which safeguards universal suffrage, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said.
Deshapriya made these observations speaking at a seminar on universal suffrage, democracy and peoples sovereignty at the Matara District Secretariat on Tuesday. The seminar was organised by the University Teachers' Association.
Deshapriya said laws relating to free and fair elections should be stern and strong. If people voted for policies rather than election promises, it could be described as democracy. There should be a level playing field if people's sovereignty is to be safeguarded. The basis of administrative power is public opinion expressed through periodical elections held on schedule, he said.
"Nowhere in the world have election commissions been empowered to hold elections according to a schedule. It is decided by Parliaments. Legislative power is entrusted to Parliament," Deshapriya said.
"If it is to be interpreted in cricket parlance even if the two teams and the pitch is ready, the match cannot be played without the ICC approval. Our ICC as regards elections is Parliament," the Election Commission Chairman said.
Ruhuna University Science Faculty Dean Prof. Jayantha Pasdunkorale spoke.

Wadey seller robbed by two men in three-wheeler
A woman selling wadey on the roadside for a living in the Ibbagamuwa area was robbed of her daily wage when two men in a three-wheeler snatched the tin in which she put her daily collection to. The victim of the incident happened to 57-year-old H. M. Hemathilaka, a resident of Gokarella, Godgama. She made a living through the selling of wadey in a makeshift hut on the Kurunegala-Dambulla main road, on the outskirts of Ibbagamuwa town.
In addition to selling wadey, she also earned a meagre living through the sale of rubber slippers.
At around 12.30 in the afternoon, two men in a three-wheeler, stopped before my shop. They asked me if I could give them wadey for Rs 100.
But I told them that I didnt have so many wadey to sell at the moment but if they could wait a bit, I could make them some more. One of them agreed to it and he got off the three-wheeler and came and sat inside the shop. The other man turned the three-wheel around and went away.
As the oil heated up, I came to the front to check on how many wadeys I had prepared to make and as I was counting the wadey, my back towards the road, I heard the sound of loose coins being dropped from within the shop.
When I raised my head to look, I saw the man inside the shop, near the cash tin.
When I came running inside, the man ran away with the money in hand, at the same time, the three-wheel that left came speeding by and those two escaped with the money. I ran, screaming after them but I could not catch them.
That tin had around Rs.15,000 in cash- that was money I had collected for the past few days, through the sale of wadey and slippers, Hemathilaka said relating her tale of woe.
Hemathilaka further lamented that the money in her tin had been to repay her loans to the businessman from whom she was getting her slipper for sale and that she now faced a great problem in repaying her loan to him.
Area residents state that a large number of youth in the Ibbagamuwa area have been addicted to drugs and drug related crimes have been on the rise in the area.
They suspect that this crime too might have been committed by drug addicts in the area.
The robbery had been recorded in a CCTV camera in a shop nearby and the police hope to apprehend the suspects through investigations into the footage.

AMW showcases at SLAITO
Following the recent launch of the 2017 Nissan Civilian, AMW recently showcased the new Nissan Civilian at the SLAITO exhibition giving visitors a firsthand look at why the new Nissan Civilian is a segment leader.
Marketed as a segment leader in fuel economy and power, the Nissan also has a plush interior making each journey a memorable one for its passengers.
AMW also showcased their passenger and dual purpose versions of the Nissan Urvan which gives customers the option of choosing custom seating arrangements according to their requirement, samples of which were on display at the exhibition.
Similarly the dual purpose Nissan Urvan is P registered where the driver does not require a heavy vehicle license, another reason why the Nissan Urvan is a more suitable option for new buyers. Exhibition visitors were also given the chance to test drive the 2017 Nissan Urvan and experience its segment leading features. AMW Capital Leasing together with Nissan made SLAITO even more exciting by giving Nissan Urvan customers the chance to purchase the Urvan with no monthly payments for the entire first year while Nissan Civilian customers were lucky enough to be able to lease the Nissan Civilian only at 7.99% interest for the first year, making the Nissan Urvan and Nissan Civilian attractive buying options in its segment.

Angelo, and his parting remarks
Sri Lankas outgoing cricket captain Angelo Mathews may not be the toast of many a Lankan cricket fan for leading Sri Lanka to defeat against bottom ranked Zimbabwe. His parting words, though, on relinquishing leadership of the national cricket team, no doubt, will have resonance with a majority of the general public.
Mathews said it was time to pass on the baton and the loss alone was not the reason. He had contemplated giving up the captaincy even before, but stayed on for the sake of the team. However, he could not turn a blind eye to the failures of the team during the last several months. He would not like to cling onto power and would like to quit when it was time to go. Yes, there have been some poor performances and I am humble enough to accept it, Mathews said.
While earning the appreciating of the public for his humble exit, Mathews, though, would certainly not endear himself to our politicians who would cling onto power come what may, nay, overstay their welcome. They never resign but only resign themselves to their fate, when one day they get booted out of power. Mathews was only stepping down from the helm of a cricket team which underwent reversals in recent times. He was not accused for match fixing or any such misdemeanour that tarnished the image of his team and the country at large. This could hardly be said of our politicians, who had not only done enough damage to the country and the economy by fixing DEALS, but also inflicted misery and hardship on the population by their policies and decisions.
There have been Sri Lankan politicians, far too many to enumerate, who had dug in their heels and refused to quit for far worse crimes than leading Sri Lanka to defeat against some cricketing minnow. In India, where the political culture resembles that of Sri Lanka in many ways, government ministers are known to resign, owning up for lapses in their particular ministries. There were instances where Indias Minister in charge of railways stepped down following a horrible rail tragedy that claimed dozens of lives. One also recalls a Minister of Aviation quitting his post following a plane crash, accepting responsibility for the loss of lives, though the minister concerned could not have had a direct hand in the said tragedy.
But here, in sunny Sri Lanka, no one resigns even if there are public outcries for their exit. One recalls the shameful incident during Black July when over 50 prison inmates in Welikada were brutally done to death by fellow inmates in one of the blackest episodes of the July riots. No one came forward to take responsibility, least of all, the minister in charge of prisons. That worthy, though, resigned many years later at the height of the second JVP uprising when UNP ministers were being gunned down with regular monotony. There were no takers, either, for the prison massacre of 2012, where, let alone resigning, evidence has now come to light to indicate the hand of a powerful figure of the then government being behind the whole episode.
Mathews may have stepped down, since, in his own mind, the time was appropriate to leave the stage and hand over the captaincy to a successor. But Sri Lanka had a captain of the political variety, who, let alone stepping down after serving two full terms as skipper went onto bend the rules to be captain for life, which, fortunately, failed to come to pass, with the spectators, who themselves elected the captain, saying enough was enough. It was clear to all that this captain was keen to keep the captaincy within the family and they would have none of it.
Of course, one could say that it would not make a difference for Mathews, who by now, would have earned enough to put him on easy street for the rest of his life. But for some captains in politics, whose loot have been stashed away in overseas banks, the clock cannot stop and the sky is the limit. Hence, the desperate attempt by this particular captain to play another innings even after completing the regulated two innings. This captain, it appears, wont be stopped and will take no for an answer even though the laws were changed recently allowing all captains, hereafter, to play only one inning. This restriction, though, has not dampened the spirits of the former political captain who would not even mind being given the post of vice captain, the love he has for the game being that much.
Be that as it may, the exit of Angelo Mathews from the captaincy for failing to deliver in that role should also serve to remind those at the helm of affairs of Sri Lanka Cricket to get their act together.

Beyonce has shared the first picture of herself with her twins to celebrate them turning one month old.
The US singer also confirmed they are called Sir Carter and Rumi -which had been rumouredafter she and husband Jay-Z filed a trademark for the names.
The pictureshowed the 35-year-old mother-of-three and the twins draped in a purple floral sheet, while she wore a blue veil.
It clocked up more than two million likes on Instagram in an hour.

As well as the twins, a boy and a girl, Beyonce and rapper Jay-Z are also parents to five-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy.
The style of the image, in which Beyonce stands in a garden barefoot in front of a floral archway,echoes the photoshootshe used to announce her pregnancy on the network. That post, in February, became the most-liked in the history of Instagram.
The world had been eagerly awaiting the first glimpse of the babies ever sinceAmerican media reportedthe Lemonade singer had given birth last month.
But neither she nor Jay-Z had confirmed any details of the twins until now.
Her father Mathew Knowles had tweetedon 18 June, saying: "They're here!" and "Happy birthday to the twins" - but the timing of Beyonce's post suggest they were actually born on 14 June.
It's no surprise that fans were quick to share their thoughts on the picture.

Board of Investment (BOI) Chairman Upul Jayasuriya resigned on Thursday. He said the reasons for his resignation were personal. It was my own decision. I would like to thank the State Minister, the Prime Minister, and the president for having supported me in discharging my duties these past two years. I stand by my decisions, taken honestly and in keeping with the dignity of the post, though some were difficult.
Mr.Jayasuriyas resignation comes in the wake of a Daily News expos on questions surrounding the controversial agreement between the BOI and Al Aman World Capital Centre. In it, the Daily News revealed that Al Aman had either been dishonest or presented conflicting narratives about its supposed height, supposed amenities, supposed location, and supposed architect, among other things.
When questioned by the Daily News following the tendering of his resignation to President Maithripala Sirisena as to whether or not the story published had impacted his decision to step down, Mr. Jayasuriya replied in the negative.
If the media is going to run things like this on potential investors, that will deter them. Many of them have called me and told me this. It has impacted them, not me, he said.
Upul Jayasuriya is a Presidents Counsel and former Chairman of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka. He was appointed Chairman of the BOI in February 2015.

Busy Fingers..!
You seem to be so busy yet you are so quiet! I asked my friend as I called him on his landline.
Im messaging you, with my cell phone! he said, sounding exasperated.
What I shouted, You dont have to text me, Im talking to you!
But I find it easier to text! he said on the phone, then went quiet. I heard the loud ping on my cell phone and realized he had actually messaged me.
I also heard him hanging up. Hed even forgotten to say bye.
And thats the state of the world today. As I pass hoardings all over the city I see a price war taking place between different mobile phone companies. Chat free!, says one. Just chat, just chat, just chat, say a thousand other boards and banners fixed all across every bus stop and store, all over town, country and the whole world.
Talk is out, chat is in!
I know friends of mine working for multinationals and other corporate firms, who sitting in little cubicles, with half a wall of plywood between them, typing messages to one another, instead of pushing back their chair and conversing.
You walk into these offices and find their fingers set over cell phone. You think they are busy at work, till you see a smile, or hear a laugh and you know a word, a letter, a sentence, not something you said, has brought out a laugh! I know that soon, the laugh from their throat, or smile on their face will be converted into an expression, a smiley, an emoji on their phone monitors.
Laughter and tears, you have been replaced by symbols! I shout, but no one hears me.
Its the next stage in evolution, said a doctor to me. Just as man evolved away from his tail, when he stopped swinging from trees, so will we evolve out of voice!
What about singing I asked my doctor friend, as he switched on his phone and I listened to some garish sounds coming from it, Thats the music of today! he said, maybe silence is better huh Bob
What did you say I asked.
WordsI he said, Looks like youve forgotten how to use your ears! and we both burst into laughter.
Texting, said my doctor friend, is becoming more addictive than talking, and there are less hassles involved.
Hassles I asked.
Yes, said my friend, imagine in talking youve got to meet physically at a place and be aware of the other persons body language. No such problems when you chat. You are free!
Free I asked.
Yes, free to type something and to mean something else. Chat is a true actor acting a role on stage, your phone screen!
Chat is an act: No gestures. No voice. Just a performance of words on your phone which is actually meant for speaking!
A silent world with busy fingers is happening..!

Central Committee to decide
SLFP's involvement in Govt:
The SLFP Central Committee towards the end of year will decide whether to continue in the Unity Government or not, State Minister Dilan Perera said.
Addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, the State Minister said all 41 SLFP members in the Government would take a united decision after evaluating achievements and setbacks during the past two years.
There were times, SLFP Ministers and Deputy Ministers met step motherly treatment in the Government. The clash of opinions was not rare. We were disappointed too," Perera said.
"However, our presence in the Government also helped to gain achievements to the country. President Maithripala Sirisena did not become isolated in the Government due to our presence. The SLFP could hold back the UNP in implementing certain decisions that could have been detrimental to the country, he said.
Asked whether the SLFP would have to continue to support the Government to make sure President Sirisena would not be isolated, Perera replied, Sirisena is a personality who did highly unpredictable acts. He, who puts the signal lights to left and turned the vehicle to right, may even turn the vehicle left again by putting the signal light to right. He will make sure that he will not be isolated.
Perera, commenting on SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayakes statement that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would not be given nomination from the SLFP again, said it was an unwarranted statement by the SLFP General Secretary.
Compared to Mahinda Rajapaksa who is Duminda Dissanayake Dissanayake is still a baby compared to him. Rajapaksa did not even bother to respond Dissanayake. Dissanayake will not come up with such statements as he acquires more experience as the General Secretary, he said.
Perera was of the opinion that there is no point in continuing the anti-corruption secretariat, adding that a political hand was behind its operations.

Long live Carlo, a benevolent public servant!
As an ordinary citizen I never hesitate to say the doctors belonging to the GMOA are acting like idiots because some of its members recently have made a statement that they would stage another strike paralyzing the hospitals if the service of retiring Professor Carlo Fonseka was not extended.
It was reported in the national news papers that the delegation of the GMOA led by its President Anura Padeniya and Secretary Haritha Aluthge met Prof. Carlo Fonseka at his residence and requested him to remain in the post and the GMOA would resort a country-wide strike if he was removed by the Government.
In response the professor pleaded with the GMOA not to strike on behalf of him putting the innocent patients in peril. I admire what a fine benevolent, good hearted personality was the outgoing SLMC President.
Really the persons like him should remain in the public service. Forever! Be happy and long live Prof Carlo.

Counter terrorism legislature, a challenging prospect: Sagala
Developing counter terrorism legislature anywhere in the world is challenging and it is a fine balance to ensure that it meets counter terrorism measures while not giving rise to human rights abuses, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said yesterday.
The Minister was addressing the opening ceremony of the eighth SAARC Ministers of Law and Order (Interior/Home Affairs) meeting at Galle Face Hotel.
In April of this year, Cabinet approved a framework for a new Counter Terrorism Act to replace the existing Prevention of Terrorism Act and despite the challenges, the Minister said the new Act would help deal with the latest challenges of global terrorism.
It is unlikely that a pluralistic community like Sri Lanka with a history it has gone through will ever agree to a uniform definition of terrorism, the Minister said but explained that they had sought consultations with a wide variety of members of both the security establishment and human rights lawyers to strike a good balance.
We have also invited United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-terrorism Ben Emmerson to visit Sri Lanka from July 10-14 to gather first hand information on the initiatives taken to deal with counter terrorism while promoting and protecting human rights, he added.
As the region enveloped by terrorism and drug trafficking looks to work together to curb its spread, Sri Lanka, the minister said had been successful in steering the conversation towards dealing with the spread of narcotics and psychotropic substances within SAARC.
Within Sri Lanka however, we have been unsuccessful in curbing the menace and we need to tackle the scourge at home. The governments goal is to reduce the drug menace to minimum
levels by 2020 through a strategy of supply control and demand reduction,he said.
All efforts make by all parties to make SAITM a public property will be taken without any interruption and the proposed summit organised by Anti SAITM Peoples Barricade will be held in Colombo on July 20 as planned without any change, he added.

Dambulla Temple needs urgent conservation: Akila
Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said the government need not intervene unnecessarily with Dambulla Cave Temple but there is an urgent need to protect its frescoes, declared as a World Heritage by UNESCO.
The minister said the frescoes of the ancient Dambulla Temple are in a dilapidated condition, which needs urgent attention. He said so when he was questioned by a representation of youth Bhikkus at Temple Trees whether there is any truth that the government is planning to have control of temples.
The Minister said the condition of frescoes of Dambulla Temple cannot be accepted and there is an urgent need to restore it.
At the same time, the temple receives a huge amount of money from foreign visitors. But there is no proper management. The money can be utilised for the development of thousands of less developed temples, he said.
When asked whether the tills are sealed by the government, the minister said it is not a new practise as it is carried out by the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs since 1930. The money in tills are not utilised for any other activity other than utilising for the promotion of Buddhism.
Dambulla Temple is at risk of being removed from the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites if the temple does not abide by UNESCO regulations and recommendations, the minister added.

Development Vs power politics
Uma Oya debacle has once again focused attention on the much talked about contradiction between development and environmental preservation. Politicians who vie for mega projects for reasons other than national interest often challenge environmentalists whether they want to sacrifice development for the sake of environmental preservation. In their opinion certain destruction of the environment is inevitable in development. Yet what is hidden is a more sinister factor power politics of politicians. Uma Oya project is a classic example of the destruction caused by the neglect of environmental feasibility and public interest. Suffice to say that opposition by the people of the area affected by the project was even considered as acts of treachery.
The large-scale destruction of houses numbering seven thousand or so, the dislocation of the population and the drying of water resources have caused an immense humanitarian crisis. It has been now revealed that the project has technical faults, especially in the construction of the tunnel which was hailed as an engineering marvel. Moreover, since about 70 percent of the work has been completed it cannot be abandoned without colossal economic loss. Thus it has become a fait accompli.
It is said that the objective was to divert waters to the Hambantota district. Obviously the former government would have thought it politically advantageous and expeditious. However, there were other viable solutions to improve the water supply to that district. For example, the comprehensive development of the Gin ganga and Nilwala ganga projects, for which foreign expert advice was already at hand and the integrated development of a series of reservoirs connecting and channeling the waters of the Kalu ganga, Gin ganga and Nilwala ganga to the Hambantota area would have solved the water scarcity there.
Humanitarian problems
Power politics has always been a bane of development. For example, the original proposal of the Soviet Union to divert waters of the Mahaweli to the North was abandoned due to the short-sighted and communal politics of those who were in power. Besides the Mahaweli project telescoped to be completed in 30 years on an express schedule had ignored the damage to the water table in the hill country. Concerns of experts on the possibility of land slide dangers were brushed aside with contempt. In this respect one should mention the life-time contribution of Dr. S A Wickremasinghe, former MP and Communist Party leader.
The hurried and partly completed Nilwala ganga project resulted in massive flooding in the Matara district. Both local and foreign expert opinion was ignored. Patch-work remedies that are applied even today are giving rise to more humanitarian problems.
What is most striking is the piece-meal approach to the development of water resources. There should be a holistic approach taking into concern the totality of water resources, development needs and the humanitarian factors.
The contradiction between environmental preservation and power politics is not confined only to such mega projects. Even smaller projects suffer from the same ailment. Take for example, garbage disposal. The dumping of Colombo garbage in Meetotamulla without concern for environmental degradation and the attendant health and other humanitarian issues ultimately caused a huge disaster when dozens perished and hundreds were displaced. Keeping Colombo clean at the expense of suburbs can be politically favourable but on the whole disastrous.
Election times
The same is true of highway projects. Sometimes original proposals are truncated to suit political interests of the ruling dispensation with a view to gain electoral advantages. That is why deadlines for project completion often coincide with possible election times.
It is tragic that even at present when disasters of immense magnitude have occurred politicians still engage in competing with each other to prove who is guiltier and who is more responsible for them.
The opposition of the Joint Opposition on the Uma Oya issue is a comedy since it was they who originally initiated and carried out the project and hence responsible for its faults. That does not however, exclude the present rulers who also blindly followed the original plan without heeding public warnings.
Actually all post-independence governments up to now are responsible for the errors and omissions in development activities.
Uma Oya disaster once again shows the necessity of consulting all stakeholders including the vulnerable population in designing development projects instead of imposing them from above in a bureaucratic manner.

Doctors, beware!
SAITM issue is showing its monstrous head again under the pretext of Professor Carlo Fonseka. The GMOA Secretary has announced indefinite strike if the Health Minister fails to extend Prof. Carlo Fonsekas period as the President of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
The SAITM crisis has now become the talk of the town over the last few months because the GMOA is threatening every now and then to stage another countrywide strike against the SAITM issue without considering the hundreds of thousands of poor and innocent patients all over the country who have become the scapegoat in the tug of war between the government and the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA).
It is crystal clear that appointing a suitable person to the SLMC Presidents position is an absolute prerogative of the Health Minister. Besides, it is beyond the purview of GMOA to recommend someone or unnecessarily poke their nose into the SLMC appointments.
In this pathetic situation, anyone obviously tends to think that these doctors have the authority to make recommendations to the government and also demand anything from the government by this strike weapon. This is an unhealthy situation which will grow bitterness between the GMOA and the general public because this is the fifth time they have declared the strike this year.
Humanitarian and noble profession
Let me ask them a polite question from the strikers. Are these strikes against the government or general public Why are you trying to take revenge on the innocent and underprivileged people who are always waiting at the doors of the hospitals to get medicine As we all know the patients from throughout the country underwent untold hardships and much inconvenience during these recent strikes.
Why are these GMOA so adamant in this SAITM issue Is this the strike to bring benefits to people or the doctors themselves No, its quite clear neither the strikers nor the government will obtain benefits but apparently, this will bring huge benefits to the subversive, unscrupulous conspirators who are expecting to fulfil their narrow, mean and selfish agenda.
The doctors maintain that the SAITM falls short in fulfilling the required standard to be a medical faculty and students lack eligibility to be enrolled as medical faculty students. If so there are so many alternative ways and means to seek a sustainable solution for this issue. Why this strike The SAITM case has a pending decision from the court as well. Moreover, the people world over believe that the medical profession is a humanitarian and noble profession.
Doctors are given their due respect because the people tend to think that they are superior people who can save lives of patients. But in reality, the doctors deviate from their basic concept and have forgotten their Hippocrates Oath that they made promises to saves lives of people. I kindly appeal to the GMOA to consider the plight of poor and helpless patients when you declare strikes. First and foremost the OPD patients are affected.
They come to the hospital from various places for consultation, clinical purposes and treatments with a great difficulty. Then the inmate patients who are already being treated. They are just stranded because of the meaningless strike. At the same time, these poor and innocent patients have no access to the private medical facilities due to their poverty.
Thus they highly depend on the governments free medical services. So it is highly unjustifiable that the doctors, having obtained free education. To my knowledge, doctors strike is profoundly unacceptable.
Demand for private universities
As Sri Lanka is a developing country there is still a scarcity of doctors. Taking this fact into consideration we have to produce more and more doctors according to the demands. Further, there is a considerable amount of doctors who serve overseas. There is no harm in producing more doctors from both the state and private universities. Since we have only eight state medical faculties out of 16 national universities in our country, there is a great demand for private universities to produce more doctors who can be employable in our country or overseas. This is the modern trend in the world.
We must look at the issue in a broader, effective and efficient manner that will bring a lot of benefits to the country and people as well. I have my own experience in Oman where our Sri Lankan doctors work for Defence Ministry of Oman and draw a very attractive salary. Some of them have migrated to Australia. So be broad minded and think about our future generation too who will dominate the world market and bring in foreign currency to our country.
Hence I kindly request the GMOA to give up the ideas of strikes over and over again. Doctors know more than us. Suppose if a patient loses his or her life due to your strike, who can resuscitate him or who will compensate for their precious life So think twice before you leap into the strike.

Rural development activities are expedited in the Divisional Secretariat Division of Eastern Province. The physical resource development activities of schools have been given priority, Eastern Province Health, Indigenous Medicine, Social Services, Probation Child Care and Rural Electrification Minister A.L.M.Naseer said.
School Principals should take utmost care regarding the development of schools and curricular activities, he said.
The Provincial Minister was addressing a meeting of the development of Addalaichenai Al  Muneera Ladies High School at the school premises, recently.
The Addalaichenai Jummah Grand Mosque donated a plot of land to the Addalaichenai Al-Muneera Girls High School for its extension and development.
The land deed was handed over to the school principal M.H.M.Razmy and SDC Secretary A.B.Abdul Gaffoor by the Mosque President and Senior Lecturer of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka A.L.Hanees and Trustee Board Senior Member A.B.M.A.Cader on the occasion.
The meeting was presided by school principal M.H.M.Razmy. Eastern Provincial Council Opposition Leader M.S.Udumalebbe, Akkaraipattu Zonal Education Director A.L.M.Cassim, Addalaichenai Divisional Education Officer M.A.C.Gassaly, Coordinating Secretary to the EP Chief Minister S.L.M.Faleel, Senior Lawyer S.M.A.Gaffoor, School Development Committee Secretary A.B.Abdul Gaffoor, School Management Board officials and Members of Board of Trustee participated.
Naseer said the principal and teaching staff of the schools may belong to different political parties, but they should not show any difference to their students. Otherwise, it will bring about the break  down of schools particularly in administration and academic activities, he said.
We are allocating sufficient funds for the development of schools considering the urgent needs.
They include the reconstruction of old buildings, putting up school name boards, access gates, protective fences, construction of childrens activity rooms, childrens playground, doors and windows repairing, painting, pavement reconstruction and landscaping.
We are politicians and we are not against educational programmes and development of schools, he added.
He said the Akkaraipattu Zonal Education office is contributing largely towards the education development of the division which should be appreciated by everyone in this village.

There are currently 30 women who sell traditional foods using locally produced agro-based products.
The purpose of the support has been to increase the living standards of women as well as to create more work opportunities and better income for the poor and marginalized communities, particularly women.

Also during the visit to Batticaloa, 90 graduates who have successfully completed training on heavy equipment operation and modern dressmaking were awarded certificates at the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka (VTASL).
This initiative, in collaboration with Sri Lanka Institute of Textiles and Apparels (SLITA) and Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka, has been implemented by the ILO with EU-SDDP support.
Libuse Soukupova together with Nina Brandstrup who is the Representative of the FAO also attended the ceremonial opening of the Multi-Species Marine Finfish Hatchery in Tharmapuram, supported through the EU-SDDP.
The Hatchery was inaugurated by the Minister of Fisheries Mahinda Amaraweera. The project has been implemented by FAO with the aim to fulfill the national requirement for the development of marine finfish farming in the country.
The Hatchery has a capacity to produce four million fingerlings annually and is the largest marine finfish hatchery in Sri Lanka.
The establishment of the hatchery will facilitate the development of marine aquaculture in the Eastern Province and islandwide, where fingerlings can be provided to fishers to further embark on marine pen, cage or pond culture.

Every Princess Dream
Three years ago she crossed the Atlantic with a broken heart. Her relationship with ex-fianc and boyfriend of eight years had come to an end amidst claims that he had cheated on her. Needing time to get herself back together she flew to New York in search of 'peace and quiet.' And promptly fell into the arms of the man who would, in the months to come, completely heal her broken heart.
As the old saying goes, you have to kiss a few frogs before you find Prince Charming. This was so for Princess Madeleine, the younger daughter of King Carl and Queen Silvia of Sweden. After some hard knocks on the path to true love, she found her dream husband in Chris O'Neill, a 36-year-old millionaire who makes a living dishing out financial advice to super-wealthy clients and who bears more than a passing resemblance to her former finance.
Chris is the son of socialite Eva O'Neill who reportedly once dated Prince Charles and made a splash in 2003 when she invited the future King to a celebration of Mozart's music, and greeted him with a kiss  a gesture which was captured by the British press and witnessed by Camilla, who also attended the event.
How does he fit into the Royal Family Perfectly, it seems. According to Madeleine's mother, Queen Silvia Chris is "every mother-in-law's dream". This glowing review from the Queen comes courtesy of his gallant behaviour  and his glittering society credentials. And his kindness and his sensitive ways.
He was overcome with emotion and struggled to hold back tears as he waited at the altar, at the Chapel of the Royal Palace of Stockholm, on 8th June 2013, watching his beautiful bride glide towards him accompanied by her proud father King Carl XVI Gustaf.
Princess Madeleine looked breathtakingly beautiful in a pleated organza gown with ivory-coloured Chantilly lace detailing by Valentino. The bridal bouquet that Madeleine carried consisted of classic white garden roses: Austin roses, Winchester Cathedral and Alabaster, as well as lilies of the valley. All the flowers were white, and the bouquet was tied into a round shape. Her dazzling tiara was softened with sprigs of orange blossom, in harmony with the ceremony's summer meadow theme, which was evident in the chapel's beautiful floral decorations as well. Adorning the chapel were beech leaves, cow parsley, pink and white peonies, white lilacs, foxgloves, and lilies of the valley, all in keeping with the pale pink, green and white colour scheme, inspired by the natural beauty of the early summer in Sweden.
Seen as Sweden's answer to William and Kate's royal romance, many European royals were present at the wedding to witness the couple's vows with the minister addressing Madeleine by her full name, Madeleine Thrse Amelie Josephine, and Chris as Christopher Paul O'Neill. The couple looked intently into one another's eyes and exchanged smiles as they made history in becoming man and wife.
While his efforts to learn Swedish lead us to understand why the queen would call him "every mother-in-law's dream" after he placed a stunning diamond ring on Madeleine's finger, that accolade no doubt, extended to include every princess' dream.
As Jenny Alexandersson, the royal reporter at Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, said, the breakup with her boyfriend had been 'really, really hard' for Madeleine. She was really sad...this time I hope it's a big love. They look really, really happy together so I'm crossing my fingers for them.'
Let's cross ours too. - Aditha

Expo Lanka to tap North American trade lanes
Expo Lanka Holdings (EFL) is looking at deepening the penetration in both the North American and Intra-Asia trade lanes, with an equal emphasis on growing air and ocean freight volumes.
At the same time, EFL would look to make inroads into untapped territory, mainly the transpacific trade lane where ocean freight traffic has been on the rise in recent years, said Group CEO Hanif Yusoof.
In the logistics sector, the main priority would be to position EFL as the first global logistics brand originating from the sub-continent. To drive this, we expect to pursue a two-pronged approach; grow the freight business and expand the logistics operations globall.
Growing ocean freight volumes amidst the current overcapacity scenario however calls for some caution and requires EFL to hone its procurement programme and further refine pricing strategies to secure a competitive advantage
At the same time, sharpening EFLs profile as an end-to-end logistics service provider calls for renewed efforts to expand the warehouse and distribution management model globally.

Govt taking revenge from poor farmers by cutting their water supply:Vitharana
A conspiracy is going on to postpone both Local Government Polls and Provincial Council Elections. A `Protest Day' and a Hartal similar to August 12 in 1953 should be declared against this conspiracy, Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said.
Addressing a press conference held at the LSSP Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that presenting amendments in connection with LG Polls to Parliament is delaying and efforts are being made to delay the PC polls by stating that women representatives should be given 30 percent of representation which would take a long time. Meanwhile the UNP, JVP, SLMC and some other political parties demand that percentage selected through the ward system should be reduced to 60 percent from the current 70 percent. The delimitation should be done again if this happens, which would take a long time.
According to Prof. Vitharana, both the Prime Minister and his Government should be chased away because both are against the people's wishes and protect the rich through tax policy and torturing the poor through the same. The Government has reduced direct taxes to 15 percent in order to assist and protect the rich, while increased indirect taxes to 85 percent which torture the poor people.
The Government is taking revenge from poor farmers by cutting down the water they use for farming. This happened at Welioya in Mullaitivu. The Government has stopped the Kivul Oya Irrigation scheme in order to supply no water farmers who are suffering due to the long drought, he added.

Govt urged to ban man power agencies
The Inter-Company Employees' Union yesterday urged the government to ban the recruitment of workers through man power agencies.
Addressing the media at the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR), Maradana, yesterday, Inter-Company Employees' Union General Secretary Janaka Adikari said the union will not hesitate to take stern trade union action and use the full power to solve the issue if the Government does not solve it soon.
He said they are ready to take measures within the democratic framework to put an end to this menace. He said the illegal man power slavery system has become a threat to the basic trade union rights of the employees.
Adikari said the rights to form and join trade unions, to collectively bargain and to strike are universal human rights.
The man power agencies violate the basic labour rights of the workers.
He said man power workers are afraid to voice their opinion as it would put their employment in danger since any protest could lead to a transfer or losing the opportunity to work.
The system has created a safe environment for the employers to get the maximum use of man power workers without protecting their basic labour rights. Man power agencies sell people to the companies and earn money, he said.
Union General Secretary Adikari said profit making is the only purpose of hiring workers from man power agencies.
The employer of the company become free from the responsibility of labour rights under the system. Workers have limited access to social protection, receive low wages and have obstacles in joining a trade union or bargaining collectively, he said.
Adikari said hiring workers from man power agencies has been common practice in the private sector.
Companies prefer hiring manpower workers since it is convenient for them as there are no responsibilities towards the workers, he said.
He said the Government is promoting this. Some state institutions such as Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), State banks, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the Water Board and the Central Bank have begun recruiting manpower workers.
Adikari said though there is an Act called a Fee-Charging Employment Act, no regulations have been gazetted to make it effective.

The Government has no need to frame a new Constitution by going against the people. It will present a new Constitution that would enhance the country's security, national unity and religious accord, said Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.
He was addressing a meeting after laying the foundation stone for the Gampola new Courts Complex costing Rs. 458 million recently.
He said that certain newspapers carried banner headlines alleging that Buddhism would lose its rightful place and the country's unitary status would be jeopardised under the proposed new Constitution. But in fact, the Government had not even made a formal draft of the proposed Constitution.
The Government would formulate a new constitution with an open mind, giving due consideration to public views and suggestions. As such, the new constitution would be a people's constitution which would be acceptable to all the people.
Minister Rajapakshe said his Ministry had taken several steps to overcome the problem concerning the laws delays. This was not a problem confronting only Sri Lanka, but common to many other countries such as the USA, India and UK.
Facilities given to Courts countrywide during the last two years was unprecedented during the previous 20 year period. There were 31,000 files held up in the Attorney General's Department for the last 20 years and 6,000 of them had now been cleared, while the balance was being attended to improve the facilities, have now been provided to the Attorney General's Department. Earlier not a single legal enactment had been translated in to Tamil.
Now five very important legal enactments have been translated into Tamil. Steps had been taken to translate several other legal enactments into Tamil, Minister Rajapakshe said. He said steps had been taken to amend the Mediation Boards Act. The Financial limit of cases to be head by the Mediation Boards have been increased from Rs 250,000 to Rs. 500,000. Mediation Boards receive nearly 200,000 complaints annually, while almost half of it is being settled. This was a good trend.
He said the BASL had been requested to educate lawyers concerning the amendments made to the Civil Procedure Code. Former Prime Minister D. M. Jayaratne, Deputy Ministers Dushmanthe Mithrapala and Anuradha Jayaratne were also present on the occasion.

Punyasiri Dassanayake, a resident of the area said agricultural lands in Mananwatte, Ebawala, Kirioruwa, Demade Oya and Walmoruwa villages have been devastated due to the heavy growth of the invasive plant.
About 300 acres in the Nalanda reservoir is covered by the plant.
A campaign launched to destroy the plant growth in the region five years ago failed.
D. M. Herath Banda said the plant had affected the living standards of nearly 2,000 families in the area.
This thorny bush grows to a height of 5 to 6 feet.
People earning a living through inland fishing cannot use nets in the reservoir as they get entangled in the thorny bushes.
Nearly 100 fisher families had been affected by this.
Attempts made by some NGOs to destroy the plant growth had proved a failure, Banda said.

Jayasuriya confident team will turn the corner soon
Chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya was confident that the young and inexperienced Sri Lanka team will turn the corner very soon.
As a former captain and as the chairman of selectors I am disappointed that we lost the one-day series to Zimbabwe, said Jayasuriya.
We need to give them the strength and the confidence to come out of this situation. We need to fine tune some of the areas batsmen and bowlers. When you get a 100 you need try and get to 150 these are little things we need to fine tune. These are young players and they will learn and correct themselves. They should take on the responsibility. After the last ODI defeat they are under a lot of pressure.
"We need to give them the confidence and have a very close relationship with this young side. Asanka (Gurusinha) and the supporting staff will need to do it and they will come out of this situation, he said.
Jayasuriya pointed out that if Sri Lanka had lost to a side like Australia none of the questions would have been asked because Australia was a far better team.
We beat Australia 3-0, we are a capable team theres no doubt the talent is there. Give them a little bit of time. As senior cricketers we also went through such times and when the media is after you its very difficult but when you have the experience you can soak the pressure. Jayasuriya said. - ST

From Lanka, to Law, to Downunder fighting for the aborgines
Maithri Panagoda who was born and raised in Gampaha is today a successful lawyer who is fighting for the rights of the Australian Aboriginal Community. He has fought many a case to reunite children of the Stolen Generations with their families. Quite a few aboriginals have said that what they wish for more than anything is an apology and while compensation would be helpful, a sincere apology is worth more than dollars, said Panagoda in an interview with the Daily News.
Excerpts of the interview:
Q: What was your childhood like growing up in Gampaha
A: I grew up in the village and moved to Colombo when I was 15 years old. My mother was a teacher at the local school here, so we all studied in that school. I spent a bit of time in the local village school, but later I went to Colombo and joined Ananda College. From Ananda College, I entered university. I didnt live in the village after that. But my childhood in Gampaha was fantastic.
This is what I feel sad about that my children missed out on the childhood I had. One was born in England, while the other two were born in Australia. They didnt get a taste of this life here which were a lot of happy memories. When I see older people here, I realize that they were the ones I played cricket with as boys. Everyone knew my family because my father was a doctor and we lived a carefree life.
We never even wore slippers, we just walked around bare footed. We didnt have electricity, running water; the water was from the well. We studied using the kerosene oil lamp. It was a very simple life, and for a period of time, I travelled from here to Colombo every day for school. So all in all, it was a very simple, carefree, happy life. Uncomplicated.
Q: You said you left Sri Lanka for the first time at the age of 25. What was that like
A: I qualified as a lawyer here, took my oaths at the Supreme Court and went to England to be a journalist. Actually, I joined the London School of Journalism for a one year course and then planned to come back and join Lake House. But then things took a different turn.
Q: What inspired you to pursue law instead of journalism
A: I think law opened up more doors to journalism. At the same time, there were some trouble taking place in Sri Lanka at the time and my father discouraged me from returning. It was 1975. The JVP was coming up and as a young person it would have been easy for me to get involved in it. So I postponed coming back. I kept saying Ill come back next year, every year, but then I did my law exams in London and I met this girl from Sri Lanka who was also a lawyer in London and we were married. We had our first child in London and by that time, I really enjoyed working in law and decided to migrate to Australia to live and practice there.
Q: Did you know about the strong Sri Lankan community in Australia at that point
A: No, I didnt know anyone. It was a very risky journey and I did not have a job lined up. Apart from my self-confidence, I didnt have anything else. I didnt have a lot of money and thats how I joined the Aboriginal Legal Services. It was the first job I got. For four months in Sydney, I went to lots of interviews, but couldnt get a job.
Q: Were you originally looking for more socially conscious legal work
A: Not necessarily at first. I just wanted an income. I had a one year old baby and I needed to feed him. I would have taken any job. And I did take some menial types of work temporarily, just to buy milk and butter. In Sydney, I went for a number of interviews. But they all said, Without local experience we are unable to hire you, even though you possess the needed qualifications. Then I was called for an interview in Dubbo, five hours from Sydney. I had no idea where it was. Its a bit of a funny story, actually. Fresh from England, I wore a three piece suit and went for the interview only to see there were twelve aboriginal elders in their shorts and thongs to interview me. I felt out of place, but they offered me the job straight away.
Q: What was like working there [Western Aboriginal Legal Services] like
A: Very, very interesting work and hard work too. We had to travel hundreds of kilometres around the country. There was a fair bit of racism at the time and aboriginal people were facing much suffering. Our plan was to come back to Sydney in six months, but we stayed in Dubbo for ten years. I was at that job for seven years and then I setup my own practice. We liked the country, it was a bit like Sri Lanka. Quiet, not many people. It really reminded me of where I grew up. So we were very comfortable. We had two more children there and it was only when my eldest son got into high school that we thought we should move to Sydney, where there were better opportunities educational opportunities.
Q: I read that you were very involved in the Sri Lankan diaspora community in Australia. Was that specifically in Sydney 
A: Yes, in Sydney. I could speak Sinhalese quite well and I knew the Sri Lankan scenario, so I felt I could do a lot for them. Initially the people who migrated to Australia (from Sri Lanka) were English-speaking people who had studied in Colombo schools. But then there were different generations who migrated to Australia who lacked the language skills, mostly during the war and I was able to help them out. That was a great feeling, because I had always had a pitiful feeling that I had left Sri Lanka too early and didnt do enough here. So I was able to serve some Sri Lankans in that way and I got involved in a few social activities too, such as the Sri Lankan Society and the OBA (Old Boys Association) of Ananda College.
Q: Can you tell me more about your work for the aboriginal Stolen Children and the Stolen Generation Project
A: I was connected very quickly to the aboriginal people when I went to Dubbo. They liked me, I liked the work, while we had many similarities. When I came to Sydney and joined a different law firm, Carroll & ODea, the issue of Stolen Generations came up, because for many, many years, aboriginal kids were taken from their families, mostly in an attempt to erase the black race.
They thought by mixing with white people, the aboriginal race would die out, while they did so under the pretence of safety. So these kids are now in their seventies and eighties and they have suffered a lot within the white families and in other situations, physically, sexually, psychologically and mentally.
They really have suffered. So I thought we should help them out and I initiated action against the government. It had never been done before successfully, but I negotiated with the government, who ultimately agreed that politically something needed to be done. Later we set up a mediation scheme and before I left Sydney a few weeks ago, we had just finished what I think was our 185th claim.
As an aboriginal, you would get a great apology from the government and some monetary compensation, around AU$ $200,000 - 300,000, so its all very satisfying work, and the aboriginal community really appreciated it, because these people were dying. They are a dying breed now, while the problem had been perpetuated unfortunately generation after generation.
Q: What are some examples of the traumas that members of the Stolen Generation have been through
A: These were aboriginal boys and girls taken as children or as babies. The boys were taken to one home while the girls were taken to another home. In both places, the idea was to train the boys to be farmhands and labourers and the girls to be domestic servants. Some were very intelligent, of course, but they never got to pursue their studies. When they turned sixteen or seventeen, they were just sent to various places to work.
It was a very sad life. Of individual cases, I have plenty of stories. There were aboriginal girls who were sexually assaulted by the people who were supposed to care for them. And generally, they were not treated as human beings. They were punished for minor faults.
One girl, when she was about six, wet her bed once and as punishment she was thrown into the freezing swimming pool during winter and then forced to go back inside and clean the bed sheets.
With the boys, if they did something naughty, even mildly, there was a process called lining up, which is when all the other boys would line up in two rows and the offender would have to walk through the middle and the others have to punish him by punching him.
So by the time the offender got to the end, hed be all bruised. And if any boy didnt participate in the punching, hed have to go through the line-up too. It was a very cruel and inhuman way to treat them.
Q: How long on average were children from the Stolen Generation in these homes Were they ever reunited with their families
A: They were never reunited with their families until they were about eighteen. When they asked for their parents, they were told all sorts of stories such as their parents were dead or didnt want them. And if the parents tried to visit them, similar lies were told.
They were not allowed to visit. Most of the children grew up with the misapprehension that their parents didnt love them, whereas the parents were trying to reach them.
Some parents wrote letters that were never given to the kids and vice versa. So it was a very sad period in Australia.
Q: And how does your work relate to this
A: With the cases Im handling, a top government official comes to the mediation and once the aboriginal persons story is told, the official makes a really, really heartfelt apology on behalf of the Australian Government. And by this time, all the tough lawyers in the room are in tears. Its a very emotional experience. I have a young lawyer working with me and she very often breaks down. Quite a few aboriginals have said that what they want more than anything is an apology, and that while compensation would be helpful, a sincere apology was worth more than dollars.
Q: Do you think that your identity as a Sri Lankan and as an immigrant in Australia influenced the way you looked at the law and the way you interacted with Aboriginal people
A: I do think so, because I think I could easily identify the problems they had because of my own background, while the Aboriginal people gets closer to me very easily.
They suspect white people, but they accepted me straight away. They used to call me the brother and say you are one of us. So it wasnt difficult to build up a relationship. Meeting me was the first time they saw a non-white lawyer, trying to defend them and it worked out very well. I am still in touch with many of them.

New wing for fever patients at Teldeniya hospital
Teldeniya District Base Hospital will open a new wing for fever patients from next week at Outpatient Department, employing a nurse and two Medical Health Officers to identify dengue affected patients to provide proper medical treatment without delay, said Medical Superintendent Officer at Teldeniya District Base Hospital Dr Chaminda Weerakoon. The purpose of opening this new wing is to distinguish patients who should be treated outdoor or indoor.
He said most of the dengue patients come to the hospital for admission directly after undergoing NS 1 test whereas most of those cases can be treated at OPD level.
Dr. Chaminda said the new wing will help patients undergo full blood tests and the report will be provided to them within one hour. If the patients platelets count is between 150,000 and 130,000, the patient can be treated at OPD level. If not, it is advised to undergo indoor treatment, he said. Most dengue patients were reported at Teldeniya District Base Hospital from Teldeniya a few months ago.
At present, many come from Kundasale and a few come from Udadumbara.

Not another brick in the wall...
Juliet Coombe was invited to the LEGOLAND Castle Hotel grand opening and found herself lost in a world of Merlin potions, talking frogs, knights in shining armour and real life size talking dragons.
Lowering its drawbridge for the first time this week LEGOLAND Windsor Resort in the UK has made this right regal experience from no less than around 2.1 million bricks and in the process brings to life an enchanted world of brave knights, magical wizards and mischievous court jesters. Colourful LEGO touches and models large and small feature throughout with a staggering 657 LEGO statues in the new castle hotel for guests to discover - from the astonishing lobby dominated by a giant floor to ceiling LEGO brick Merlin Wizard unleashing LEGO magic from his staff in the form of twinkly stars - to the tiny adorable 7cm high LEGO dragonfly models that seem life like and other creatures that talk.
With separate sleeping areas for adults and up to three children, the 61 magical Wizard and Knight bedrooms are brimming with LEGO surprises too. From the bright LEGO wall graphics to the magical LEGO models, children (and adults alike just loved it all) and will delight as we did in solving the special clues hidden in the carpet and walls to unlock the LEGO surprises that wait in the safe. Bunting, flags, LEGO shields and an illuminated stained glass window bring the majestic Knight themed rooms to life with illuminated lights behind, whilst the spellbinding Wizard rooms are bursting with LEGO magic from potion bottles, spell books and mystical LEGO creatures. In the bathrooms you have your own LEGOLAND hair wash and knightly creams and potions.
Knights and Wizards
The LEGOLAND Castle Hotel is now officially part of the park and the sculptures that have been created used a staggering 80 million pieces of LEGO.
Guests are greeted in the entrance lobby by a spectacular, floor to ceiling, 35,000 LEGO brick wizard unleashing magic from his staff, which comes to life in colour, light and sound at the press of button. Each model is individually made by hand and takes weeks to create and lots of smaller statues can be found in every one of the 61 themed bedrooms features a range of them  from owls and swords to dragons and frogs.
Each Knight room is home to a 17kg LEGO dragon, which took 60 hours to build. Each Wizard room is home to a family of three owls, which took 90 hours to build. The rooms have been created around two themes  Knights and Wizards.
Every room contains a safe and children are invited to crack the code by solving hidden clues; then break it open for their exclusive hidden LEGO surprises, which my Sri Lankan children were rather good at. Each bedroom has a separate sleeping area with uber cool bunk beds for children packed full of fun stuff to keep them amused  including, of course, lots of LEGO to fuel their imaginations and if they create something really amazing they might even one of the LEGO competitions that result in all sorts of exciting LEGO give aways.
For all of us the green LEGO dragon in the Tournament Tavern restaurant was beyond amazing as the home to an 80,500 LEGO brick snoozing dragon guarding her LEGO eggs in the glowing hearth below. Lit by flickering LEGO torches, you will spot the 8 LEGO mice playing the chandeliers and find between courses of delicious food the dragon noises will make even the naughtiest child quiet as one hardly expects ones LEGO to talk back.
Absolutely stunning
Nothing has been stinted on the amazing range of food or the 900 LEDs light up the stained glass window in the Tournament Tavern restaurant. Guests can have fun in The Jesters Play Den complete mischievous Jester in the Kings Treasure Chest made up of over 70,000 LEGO bricks and weighing 100kg. The biggest individual model is a 162,000 LEGO brick knight on horseback standing at 8.5ft tall, designed by 11-year-old competition winner, James Waine from Darlington, UK. The model was officially unveiled on July 1 in front of all the media and Breakfast time TV and us. An exciting day to be in the park as we were able to try and pull the sword out of the castle grounds, and even have a go at opening the castle gate with a giant yellow bricked key that even the big friendly giant might have found tricky to use.
Amzar and Samad loved all the roller coaster rides, pirate ships, laser battles in the Egyptian part of the park and yet it was the smallest individual model, a tiny 7cm high dragonfly and magic frog that they talked about for days afterwards. The book 50 Shades of Grey has nothing on several million pieces of LEGO grey bricks, which makes up the brand new castle LEGO hotel and resort and must be on everyones travel list when going to the UK this Summer. Just make sure between all the fun rides, water experiences and world in miniature bricks you need to take time out as you arrive or leave the park to admire the views from the top of the hill of the Queens residence Windsor Castle and London with all its iconic buildings. The views are absolutely stunning.
Both my sons amused me in the LEGO shop as they tried to work out how many boxes of LEGO they would need to buy to build their own dream home back in Sri Lanka. The idea of a LEGO villa complete with a LEGO pool on the Sri Lankan South coast with elephants amused me, as it would be quite a thing to recreate all the islands exotic birds from endless boxes full of tiny little bricks. Who knows though with all their energy and enthusiasm they might even inspire LEGO to do it for them, as it would take us a lifetime of trips to the UK taking boxes back to do it.
But what better place to have LEGOLAND than an exotic location with great weather all the year round with plenty of wild animals to get inspiration from, and be truly fun to make out of LEGO bricks. Unlike grey old England Amzar my son said it will need be in every shade of the rainbow as nothing in Sri Lanka is dull grey like Englands regal castles, which are I explained the perfect camouflage for a country that has made grey a selling point.

Orient Finance records highest ever total income
Orient Finance PLC, which is a licensed finance company, has recorded a remarkable achievement at a time it celebrated 35 years in operation.
The company was able to record the highest ever total income of Rs.3.3 billion during the financial year ended March 31, 2017, achieving 40% growth over the last financial year.
This is a remarkable achievement amidst tough macroeconomic factors. This was supported by the increase of net lending portfolio by 18.6% to record as Rs. 16.4 billion by the year end.
Net interest income also grew by 14% recording Rs. 1.29 billion.
Growth of the net interest income is less than the total income growth rate due to the narrowed margin owing to the increase of market interest rates during the year.
The company has recorded profit before tax of Rs. 301 million although the borrowing rates were higher than the previous year.
Commenting on the overall results of the company, Chairman Dr. Dayanath Jayasuriya P.C. went on to say that the strategic initiatives taken by the company have resulted in the commendable growth of its revenue surpassing Rs. 3 billion and marketing strategies have led to an increase in its lending portfolio and fixed deposit base despite unfavorable macroeconomic factors.
CEO Mayura Fernando stated that the company plans to further expand its business operations over the next few years whilst increasing customer focus and adding more value to its customer base in terms of product features and service excellence.

Panel to recommend measures to minimize natural disaster impacts
Cabinet this week established a panel of intellectuals to look into the management of impacts of natural disasters, as ministers discussed plans of action to deal with reconstruction, compensation and disaster risk preparedness in the wake of landslides and floods which wreaked havoc in the country recently.
The panel, proposed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, is to recommend short and long term measures through which the impact of natural disasters in the country can be minimized.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa had also proposed that Cabinet adopt as a national policy to empower District Secretariats to act independently and take immediate and necessary action in relief operations and to bear necessary expenses in times of disaster.
The government estimates that rehabilitation and rebuilding of properties damaged due to natural disasters would cost Rs 50-60 billion- close to 0.5 percent of GDP.
Thus, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera has proposed that the projects proposed in the 2017 Budget be reviewed and to identify their relevant priorities so that funds from less important projects can be utilized for reconstruction work. In addition, the Treasury is also to divert part of the allocations for Supplementary Assistant Services and Emergency Requirements to rebuilding work.
The Education Ministry in the meantime has decided to rebuild or relocate 472 schools (Southern Province- 182, Western Province- 177, Sabaragamuwa- 112 and Nuwara Eliya -1). The Ministry would rehabilitate necessary facilities including furniture, library, laboratories and sports items. In addition, they are expected to give three sets of uniforms and a pair of shoes for each student affected by the recent landslides and floods.
Compensation for Meethotamulla victims were also discussed in Cabinet this week with compensation granted to the deceased victims approved for Rs 1 million. Close to 393 families and 1,670 people were affected due to the collapse of the garbage dump with 60 houses completely damaged and 27 partially damaged.

Pavidi Handa says it will fight governments anti-social programmes
The Pavidi Handa Organisation said yesterday that the massive Sangha Conference would be organised shortly to protest against the harmful and anti-people social and economic programmes of the national unity government.
We are in the midst of a comprehensive political and economic crisis created by this Government, Pavidi Handa Convener Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, Thera said the Yahapalana Government had assured drastic changes when it came into power and pledged a number of benefits and relief to the people.
But when we look at what is currently taking place in the country, it is doubtful as to whether any real change had taken place. What has actually happened to this country is leading to destruction and lots of people are pushed into poverty.
The tremendous work undertaken and completed by the previous government is visible witnesses even though former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been accused of corruption by the Yahapalana members.
It is evident from what is left for us to see that the previous government had done for the benefit of the country and the people.
But, this government has not started a single development project.
Leaders of this government are still opening only the projects that former government commenced. Bribery and corruption are pervasive within the last two and half years.
We are ready to reveal all information related to these corruptions in the near future, the Thera said.
The Yahapalana government is today engaged in arresting Bhikkus who have raised their voices for the protection of Buddhism and our own self-identification.
Even though the government promised to give foremost place to Buddhism, it is now engaged in sealing the charity boxes of temples. Is this the way their protect Buddhism
He further said the government is trying to hide the figures of dengue death cases and has directed the hospitals not to divulge details.
But, we have actual details of hospital admissions and deaths occurred by Dengue and they will be revealed to the country soon. The government has also failed to provide a solution for garbage problems yet.
It is necessary to provide permanent solutions to problems of the people instead of formulating a new Constitution, the Thera added.

Pepper cultivators protest, block road
The Ratnapura-Embilipitiya road was blocked from 9.45 am onwards yesterday due to a protest staged by close to 100 pepper cultivators who demanded that the government stop the import of pepper into the country.
They blamed the fall in the local pepper prices on the governments policy of excessive importation.
Soon after the current government came into power in 2015, they started to import a lot of pepper into the country. A kilo of pepper which used to fetch Rs 1,500 now can only be sold at a price less than Rs 500, a protester said. They have thus demanded that all pepper imports be stopped. The pepper we harvest once a year, brought in enough money to allow us to be not dependent on anyone, but today we have fallen from the frying pan and into the fire, former Kolonna Pradeshiya Sabha UNP member D.R. Ariyaratne who was the main organiser of the protest said.
Residents of Godakawela, Pallebedda and Kolonna participated in the protest.

The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya commended the Government's decision to ban polythene shopping bags and food wrappers yesterday.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader and Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila said he respects the decision to ban polythene shopping bags and food wrappers, but the Government had worked in a manner that creates issues.
He was addressing the media at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya political Office at Pitakotte yesterday.
"The Government has given only three months to find an alternative solution. It is not enough to import an environment friendly substitute for polythene shopping bags and food wrappers," Gammanpila said.
He said making polythene shopping bags and food wrappers is a mass scale industry.
"A large number of people are affected by the decision to band it within a short period of time," Gammanpila said.
"The Government should take measures to find an alternative product to polythene shopping bags and food wrappers as well as a solution to those who were in the industry. However, I appreciate this decision," he said.

President, Health Minister should apologise to Cuban Government: Prof. Vitharana
President Maithripala Sirisena and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne should apologise to the Cuban Government for telling lies to the Sri Lankan people about Cuban anti-dengue drive, Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said.
Addressing the media at the LSSP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the Cuban Government did not use force to implement the anti-dengue drive in Cuba. Cuban people voluntarily took part in it with understanding, he said. Cuba does not have even a single confirmed dengue patient. There are only 270 unconfirmed dengue patients reported from Cuba during the past six months, Prof. Vitharana said.
Cuba had only 1,836 dengue patients in last year. Cuba used BTI bacteria only for unreachable places. People voluntarily cleaned up potential mosquito breeding places by organising themselves as groups in each street. They prevented water getting collected where the dengue mosquitoes can breed, he said.
"I witnessed the process myself as a member of the WHO Dengue Control task Force," he said.
"Cuba presented a report to the WHO on the dengue control programme. Two US experts, one Brazilian expert and myself went to Cuba and inspected the programme. No force was used on people," Prof. Vitharana said.
He said in Sri Lanka, the number of dengue deaths has reached to the level of 250. The number of dengue patients has reached 100,000. Out of this number, 10 to 20 percent are in a serious condition called Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), he said.

## Title: RIGHT APPROACH TO TAXING
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, July 14, 2017 - 01:00
RIGHT APPROACH TO TAXING
Proposed New Inland Revenue Act:
The government has proposed to introduce a new Inland Revenue Act with the objectives of simplifying and modernising our Income Tax Law. It is a welcome move to change the tax laws in keeping with time. However, the tax laws have to be country specific and suit the needs and circumstances of the country.
Each Revenue Authority faces a varied environment within which they administer their taxation system. Jurisdictions differ in respect of their policy, legislative environment, their administrative practices and culture. As such, a standard approach to tax administration may be neither practical nor desirable in a particular instance.
Our current Inland Revenue Act has evolved over many decades coupled with the establishment of related judicial precedence with the progress of the country. Changes to current Inland Revenue Act have been done with much care and diligence by successive governments.
Tax collection and administration
However, some of the provisions of the Act were not fully enforced to achieve the desired results. In this context, introducing an altogether new Act based on a new model presumably a model followed by an African country require much discussions and debate with civil society, stakeholders and professionals. Since we are a sovereign country, any other country or agency cannot force enactment of any laws. Instead, we have to draft our own laws to suit the needs of our country and the community which pay the taxes. While commending the inclusion of many good features in the draft bill, it would be highly desirable to reconsider some of the provisions contained in the draft bill to achieve an efficient tax collection and administration and to stimulate the economy while maintaining fairness with taxpayers.
1. Under the existing Inland Revenue Act (IRA) reasons must be given by the assessor before making an assessment. This has been removed in the draft bill. Any taxpayer would not be able to make a proper appeal in the absence of reasons for assessment jeopardising the appeal process to the detriment of the taxpayer.
2. In the current Act time bar for assessment is one year and six months if the return is filed on or before November 30 following the year of assessment. Under the new bill, this has been extended up to four years. The processing time of tax returns could actually be reduced rationally with the digitalization (automation) of operational activities in the Department of Inland Revenue. Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka, most business entities spend significant time and effort on tax compliance matters. Why should this processing be delayed for four years when it could be done within one or one and a half years. Even in India, a large country, time bar for assessment is one year.
3. Under existing IRA if a taxpayer fails to make a valid appeal before the due date for some valid reasons he can make an objection to the assessment. This relief has not been included in the new IRA bill.
4. Under the new IRA bill, the consultant- lawyer or accountant assisting in preparing the return also has to sign the return in addition to the taxpayer. The taxpayer knows the full information of his income and other particulars. Consultants assist the taxpayer in completing the return only with the information provided to them.
5. Penalties for failure to furnish returns has been increased up to Rs. 400,000/-. Under current Act it is Rs. 50,000/-. This penalty provision was in most of the cases not enforced.
6. The penalty for failure to furnish any information required by the Department has been increased up to Rs. 1 Million. Surprisingly, a taxpayer who pays the tax of Rs. 10,000/- annually may be called upon to pay a penalty of Rs. 1 Million for not furnishing a small piece of information. Thus, this provision, if arbitrarily enforced, may result in an unreasonably high penalties for a genuine small taxpayer on account of a minor lapse on his part.
7. If an entity fails to pay tax on time, every person who is or has been a manager of the entity at any time since the relevant time is jointly and severally liable with the entity and every other such person for payment of the tax. This expands tax liability over different parties beyond the actual defaulter of tax.
8. Withholding tax on rent and partners income from the partnership is not subject to any minimum limit of rental income or partnership income. Even small boutiques will have to deduct and pay this tax.
Unless reasonable minimum limits are stipulated it would be administratively difficult to implement these taxes.
9. The capital gain tax has been introduced in the new bill. This is long overdue and a welcome move. In fact, this is required in line with the concept of equity in taxation due to growing investments in capital assets. Capital gain is calculated as the difference between the consideration received and the cost of the investment asset at the time of realisation. The bill provides for the ascertainment of a deemed gain in circumstances other than death where a transfer has taken place for no tangible consideration. The capital gain will be taxed at the rate of 10%. According to the bill even if an asset is transferred by way of gift it would attract capital gain tax. In Sri Lankan culture elderly parents tend to transfer full or part of their immovable properties to their children. Since there wouldnt be any money considerations passing in such transactions people may be called up to pay taxes beyond their ability to pay such taxes. In addition, the capital gain amounts can be considerable since the cost of acquisitions could be very low in many cases assets having been acquired very long time ago. Therefore, apparently, there is a need to redefine the scope of this tax.
10. The bill does not apparently provide for any tax concessions for foreign direct investment (FDI) other than enhanced depreciation allowances. Foreign Direct investment is crucial for future growth, development and macroeconomic stability of the country. For instance, Malaysia offers tax incentives ranging from partial taxation to 10 year tax holiday for strategic projects, high technology investment etc. India grants many concessions on the regional basis for FDI and agricultural income is totally exempt from income tax making it a lucrative investment destination for investors. The policymakers should recognise how important strategic tax planning is from investors point of view. We have to consider the reality in the region and international context in formulating tax policies.
Tax evasion
The taxation policies should not be imposed as punishments to taxpayers. However, policies and procedures can be expanded to deal with tax evasion while focusing on tax content and tax base at the same time.
In this direction, integration or interconnection of Inland Revenue Department with the banking system and other vital institutions would be a reliable source of information about taxpayers and potential tax payers. Policymakers should consider socio-economic consequences and the effectiveness when implementing tax framework as a developing nation.

## Title: On the road to Jaffna

On the road to Jaffna
I was fortunate to visit Jaffna for a few days with the pleasant company of Jay Perera, an Aerospace Engineer from Melbourne. He is the son of a good friend of mine who also lives in Melbourne.
Early Morning we left Colombo on the a/c train, and reached Jaffna in six hours. I must confess that this particular train was pure luxury to me in comparison to the clap trap trains our office workers and school children have to contend with day in day out. This feeling of having been inside a plane was short lived because as the train started to jingle jangle away, my body which was calm and my mind composed was jittery but I mastered my mind saying to myself that the railway way lines around Maradana and Fort resembled a plate of spaghetti hence the wheels had to deal with not a smooth flow of straight lines but criss-crossing through the slight gaps and the curves which were a far cry from the ones you get in the female of the species.
Warakapola onwards the greenery of our lush surroundings was in evidence. Thank God this was before the heavens opened with all its fury and the devastation it caused was a direct body blow to all and sundry. They say the Weather Gods are not kind. I wonder why they are called Gods in the first place!
Maho to Anuradhapura and beyond, scrub land was evident and few inhabitants were seen in the surroundings with mud huts and thatched roofs dotted here and there. This I thought was real third world, this in comparison to the Colombo crowd with their Pajerros and cute town houses or what have you Are we living in a balanced world Not by a country mile. Even from a distance the hard ships they had to undergo to eke out a living was stamped in their innocent faces, in comparison to the boorish arrogance of the new rich lot in Colombo, it was a breath of fresh air. My toothache is why should these innocent people cow down to the dark brown Shahibs some of whom even try to bargain with them to save a few measly rupees, this I put down to lack of basic education which leads to bring out the animal instinct in the man, which at times leads to going beyond the boundaries which can have devastating effects on young lives.
Coming back to sanity, the ride has become incredibly smooth, due to the relaying of the railway lines, after the havoc created by the war. I felt as if we were in a foreign country, by now we have passed Vavunia. The train was going hell for leather past Omanthai, Mankulam, Kilinochchi, Elephant Pass, Chava and then to Jaffna, which was a dainty little station in comparison to The humongous ones in Maradana and Fort. We managed to fend our way by foot to our guest house.
Prior arrangements for the guest house and the tour guide were already pre-arranged by Jay, which was convenient. After grabbing a quick lunch, our tour guide Mohan was there to pick us up at 2 pm.
We visited the Jaffna Town as per the schedule of Mohan, the tour guide. According to the tour guide, after the independence from Britain in 1948, Jaffna town was ranked as the second largest town next to Colombo. Due to the three decades old civil war, the town was torn apart and now in the process of emerging as phoenix. The total destruction of the Jaffna GAS office, we saw with our very own eyes. Jaffna is the cultural capital of Tamils in Sri Lanka and the unique features are needed to be witnessed.
Dutch fort
Even though its called as the Dutch fort, it has more than, 2,000 years old history as archeologists recently have unearthed 2,000 years old Chinese clay pots and 1,500 years old Romanian coins in order to prove the ancient history. Despite the fact that this 22 acres fort was badly affected by bombing, for a certain extent it has been renovated.
Famous Library
Its a pity this world famous library was burnt in the early eighties with more than 97,000 books and manuscripts but in spite of all the draw backs still tries to provide the esteemed services once again to the needy in the region after it had been reconstructed.
Fishing hubs
Jaffnas sea food is very delicious as 99 percent of the catch is pure natural. Mouthwatering crabs, scrumptious prawns, and luscious cuttlefish, delectable lobsters etc are exported to many western countries due to the renowned trade mark. The splendid Christian tradition and local cultural touch can be witnessed in the construction of the Catholic and other branches of churches which can be seen in the close vicinity.
Old park
Once used by the British in the past for several administrative purpose and recreation needs now serving as one of the relaxing area for the Jaffna populace.
Nallur Temple
Its almost impossible to explain the art and culture of Jaffna without mentioning the sculpture and beauty of Nallur temple that has more than 500 years history. The most spectacular cultural and religious place in Jaffna is Nallur temple and this is a must visit destination for a traveler in north and still attractsthousands of locals daily.
15th century relics
The last Tamil ruler, King Sankilian cant be forgotten by the locals for his adventurous battle against Portuguese, and the latter finally became the first western colonial master in north. Still we could see the relics of buildings which had been built by King Sankilian and maintained by the successive rulers of Jaffna.
Museum
A small museum in the heart of Jaffna encloses sufficient relics, used utensils, manuscripts, unearthed archeological pieces etc, to illustrate the rich culture of Jaffna in spite of limited modern resources.
Keermalai Well
This well is mostly visited by Hindus who believe in its healing powers. It is a nice oblong shaped ancient construction, well maintained with very clear water. Strangely enough although it is situated just near the sea, the sea water is salty and the well water is not salty or hot. It comes from an underneath well, that seems to connect this Keerimalai Hot Springs with the Nilavarai bottomless well that is situated 10 km. away from this one.
Buddhist monuments
According to our tour guide, there were many Buddhist priests who committed suicide at once, and these monuments were built by an entrepreneur in that era in honor of them.
Direction arrows
The above direction board, shows the distance from the sea to several countries including Australia, etc.
Before I rap up this article up, I would like to pen a few words about the Jaffna people I came across during my brief stay there. They were extremely polite and each time when we asked for directions, they went out of their way to direct us to where we wanted to go. I saw no animosity towards the Sinhala people which was heartening indeed. It really is a pity that most of their counterparts in Colombo laugh at you when you show politeness to them. This frog in the well attitude of our people should be changed and sooner the better. We are all patriots and would like to see our rich culture to be reflected on the faces of people in Colombo, people up above will surely look into it, step by step.

SAARC countries need new bilateral relations: Prime Minister
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday called for the need to develop new bilateral relations among SAARC member countries while working within the SAARC framework. The Prime Minister stressing on the need to address cross border terrorism asked, All be committed to not allow any acts of terrorism and to condemn and take effective action in the case of terrorism in our region.
Addressing the eighth SAARC Ministers of Law and Order (Interior/Home Affairs) meeting at Galle Face Hotel yesterday, the Prime Minister noted that the countries needed to have different perspectives on how each interacts with the other in the region.
While all countries within the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) have been plagued with the scourge of terrorism, the Prime Minister noted that the realities of SAARC meant that they also needed to look to have bilateral agreements within SAARC to resolve specific issues relating to member countries, Have the regional framework, but it is also necessary for us to have different bilateral agreements within members, which was not contemplated when SAARC when it was started, said Wickremesinghe.
When you take drugs, our relationship with India and Maldives where small amounts of drugs come from are different to that of Afghanistan and Pakistan where large amounts come from. So our agreements when it comes to drugs with these countries have to be different, he added.
As the Secretary General of SAARC said, SAARC is a people centric organisation and thus we need to increase people to people contact.
And whilst we have free trade agreements with many, we are also looking at deepening ties with India as it is our closest neighbour and most trade is done with them. On the other hand, there is also emphasis with our agreements with Bangladesh, Pakistan and Maldives, the Prime Minister added.
The Premier further stressed that bilateral relations should be formed without straining relationships within SAARC.
All bilateral relations should be open and transparent, the Prime Minister said while keeping the SAARC framework in place and slowly trying to improve the environment within SAARC, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said. As the SAARC Immigration Authorities are also scheduled to hold their meeting to discuss easing visa regulations between SAARC countries to promote bilateral trade, the Prime Minister stressed that they needed to come up with ways to allow genuine migration while curbing terrorism, the Premier said.
Premier Wickremesinghe has been continually pushing for collaboration within SAARC, especially when it comes to counter-terrorism activities,but,with the collapse of the SAARC Summit in 2016 due to a terrorist attack on an Indian Army base in Uri by an Islamic terror outfit allegedly linked to Pakistan, the Prime Minister at the time was found to remark that Sri Lanka would have to look at other viable options if SAARC did not deliver acceptable results for all.

Serendib Flour Mills delivers first tanker silo to Diana Biscuits
Serendib Flour Mills (SFML) recently delivered its first tanker silo to Diana Biscuits and is set to offer this efficient and environmentally-friendly storage option to other customers as well.
Having consulted with Control Union Environmental Services in 2016, SFML embarked on a long-term carbon footprint reduction programme, as part of its commitment to embrace sustainable and eco-friendly practices at every juncture of its operation. The introduction of the tanker silo operation has given rise to an array of environmental, logistical, commercial, as well as health and hygiene benefits, and it serves as a prime example of the sustainable approach that SFML strives to incorporate into its overall business strategy.
The tanker silo is an innovative storage system that enables customers that buy flour in bulk to drastically reduce their logistical expenses, labour costs, energy consumption, reduction of landfill use and their overall impact on the environment.
The storage option is significantly more hygienic and allows bakeries and factories to store a minimum of 20 tonnes of flour onsite.
This eliminates the need to constantly transport large volumes of flour between the milling facility and customer factories, thereby cutting down additional transport costs, labour and fuel consumption.
Moreover, the fact that the flour stored in the tanker silo is subjected to zero human contact makes it is a much more hygienic and safer alternative.
While the tanker silo storage option promotes environmental sustainability and helps businesses to significantly reduce their impact on the planet, it also reaps an array of commercial and business benefits.
Kalinga Wijesekera, Head of Marketing and Communications, Serendib Flour Mills (Pvt) Ltd, said: We are pleased to have delivered our very first tanker silo to Diana Biscuits, this collaboration has further strengthened our business partnership, and we look forward to providing more of our customers with this innovative transport and storage option.
Serendib team working on the first flour transfer.
The tanker silo not only enables customers to save a great deal of money and energy, it also offers a more hygienic approach to storage and production.
Prasanna De Silva, CEO, Diana Trading Company (Pvt) Ltd,said: We are delighted to be the first customer to benefit from Serendib Flour Mills ground-breaking storage solution and we believe that this investment will enable us to drastically cut down operational costs, save time and resources, and run a highly efficient operation.
SFML has developed a wide range of wheat flour products that cater to diverse dietary preferences and needs, and are available in a variety of volumes and packaging formats.
The companys flagship brand, 7 Star Flour has become a household name that is a much-loved staple in homes across the island.

Responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at the SLFP headquarters in Colombo yesterday, the State Minister said the SLFP members in the Government would not allow the Bill to be passed in Parliament in its present form.
The existing Inland Revenue Act we have is a very strong one which evolved with the time.
The new draft Bill is a copy of the same the IMF prepared for Ghana. Ghana at that time had no Inland Revenue Act. We request Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera to hold the Bill for some time and allow more discussion on it, he said.
Perera also said the content in the new Bill give rise to doubts whether the Government plans to hand over tax collection to private sector.
He pointed out changes to the current system at a time the newly installed the Revenue Administration and Management Information System (RAMIS) has shown an increase in tax collection would be imprudent.
We can and discuss and bring in Amendments to the current Act he said.

Softlogic Life is insurance brand  of choice, among young
The insurance industry has been viewed as an industry which is complex and extremely traditional. Considering the public attitude towards insurance and the lukewarm reception that many have towards an insurance proposition, it is an industry that is deserving of a higher position - both as a service and a career option. Millennials, who are digital natives and enterprise thinkers especially, are looking at tech companies, multinationals and lifestyle brands to cater to their needs.
Softlogic Life has been transforming the way people have been looking at insurance both as customers and employees. What is striking about the company is its ability to attract key talent from most unlikely of industries such as FMCG, fashion, tech, and banking and even from some of the multinational giants in the world.
Softlogic Life's Head of Marketing Nuwan Widyapthige speaks about how Softlogic Life has transformed to become a lifestyle brand and a valuable employer brand in an industry that is perceived by many as challenging and demanding to work in.
Q: Softlogic Life has been able to attract key talent from different industries and companies to work for the company. Apart from that, employee morale and enthusiasm seems very high. What is the simple strategy behind this success
A: For many years, our strategy has been very simple - the way our employees feel is the way our customers will feel. This can be only achieved through our workforce who play an integral part in our success.
Our constant endeavour is to attract, invest in, develop and retain the best talent in the country. We have challenged the status quo by going after talent from diverse industry spaces which has enabled to add fresh perspective to the way we do business.
We have developed policies and guidelines for talent management, recruitment, remuneration, training, skills development, and employment equity. We have always offered best-in-class facilities to our people.
One such example is the entire top management team undergoing a leadership development programme conducted by renowned US based leadership coach Doug Adams.
Our philosophy and culture of knowledge and learning has transformed the company from a traditional insurance company to a company which operates like an innovative tech startup.
We have built a great employee engagement model with the ultimate objective of creating productive and innovative workforce by caring for their wellness and live employee life to the fullest.
We have made good progress in fostering a dynamic work culture that encourages our employees to rise to their true potential and one that attracts the best talent in the country.
Also, being part of Softlogic Group, one of the most dynamic conglomerates in the country, helps us to bring more value to our brand name.
Q: For the second consecutive year, Softlogic Life has been chosen as one of the Top 25 great places to work in Sri Lanka by the Great Place to Work Institute. What have been some of the key points on becoming a differentiator in the life insurance sector - a tough industry to attract and retain employees
A: At Softlogic Life, we believe in harnessing the full potential of our employees as a critical driver of our business success in delivering a superior client experience while sustaining happiness and wellness of our employees. Our vision and values guide our efforts to create a supportive work environment to live life to the fullest'.
We are committed to driving a culture where our people feel valued, have a clear sense of belonging, know what is expected of them and are recognized and rewarded for their contribution towards achieving our ambition to place our clients at the centre of everything we do.
Current and future trends, ranging from digitalization to working with a multigenerational workforce, are influencing how we shape our people, leadership and engagement strategies.
Q: As the fastest-growing insurance company in Sri Lanka, Softlogic Life adds more colour to the lives of Sri Lankans through the strategic campaign of Choose your Life, which complements Softlogic Life's overall strategic directive of an enabler of wellbeing'. How has this shaped up the company to become a great place to work
A: Like it encourages our customers to enjoy their life by opting for a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle, Choose your Life reminds all of our employees that it treads a path for them, ensuring their health and wellbeing at all times. This thinking has enabled our employees to further drive our success.
We always strive to ensure the safety and health of all who work for us and a simple choice made by an employee to choose their life choices wisely will make a drastic change to the way they think. That makes Softlogic Life a more people-centric organization in Sri Lanka.
Our understanding of the importance of building diverse talent and striving to create an environment where our employees have successful work, life integration, resources to achieve their goals and a culture of opportunity, has paid off again with this special recognition.

South Asia must cooperate to eradicate drug menace: President Sirisena
President Maithripala Sirisena called on South Asian leaders to cooperate in collective programmes to eradicate drug menace. He said that the spread of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances is the most dangerous threat to the youths in the region. It requires constant attention and utmost vigilance to prevent smuggling and distribution of drugs, he said.
Speaking to the delegates attending the 8th Meeting of the SAARC Ministers of Law and Order (Interior / Home Affairs), who called on him at his official residence in Colombo on Wednesday, the President said the drug menace has caused irreparable damage to the society.
He said he met the family of a child who was killed in crossfire when a group of drug smugglers fired at officers of the Narcotic Bureau recently. He said one officer and a 12-year-old child were killed and another child was injured in the firing.
The injured child showed me his gunshot wound. It was indeed a sensitive moment for me, President Sirisena said.
He said that when inquired as to what was the damage to the shop owned by the parents of the dead child, the father replied it was about Rs. 150,000.
And immediately I made a compensation payment of Rs 1.5 million to them as they have lost their daughter too. They deserve a better compensation, though money will not bring back the child, the President said. He told the SAARC delegation leaders that he narrated this story to emphasise the danger of drugs to society and children and urged them to take effective action to eradicate drugs.
SAARC Secretary General Amjad Hussain B. Sial explained to the President about the progress of first two days of official meetings and said the Ministerial Meeting will endorse the decisions.
He said that in addition to the decision on exchange of information on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances smuggling, the officials, during the discussions of immigration and emigration issues in the region, agreed to issue an electronic stamp on the passport of selected people for visa-free travel among SAARC countries.
Minister Sagala Ratnayake, Secretary Jagath P Wijeweera and Heads of Delegates from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal and Pakistan were present.
The SAARC Meeting is organised by the Law, Order and Southern Development Ministry in collaboration with the Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Ministry.
Terrorism, liberalisation of visas, illegal trafficking in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and small arms and how to make coordinated and concerted efforts to combat such menaces were the issues to be covered at the meeting.

Sri Lanka looks for turnaround in fortunes
Take on Zimbabwe in one-off Test today:
Sri Lanka cricket which has been on the wane since the current administration was elected to office 19 months ago will be looking for some sort of salvation with the change of the national captaincy.
With Angelo Mathews stepping down from the hot seat after 4 years following the stunning 3-2 defeat his team suffered at the hands of Zimbabwe in the one-day international series, the onus is now on the shoulders of 27-year-old Dinesh Chandimal to resurrect the fortunes of Sri Lanka cricket in the Test circuit.
Chandimal whos had his ups and downs as a cricketer in his short international career will make his debut as Sri Lankas 15th Test captain when he leads the country in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe at the R Premadasa Stadium today.
Sri Lanka wont settle for anything less than a win to at least compensate for the loss in the one-day series and to give them the much needed fillip to face tougher opposition later this month when they front up to India in a three-match Test series.
The last Test played by Sri Lanka in March ended in a loss to Bangladesh by four wickets at the P Sara Oval. Now with a new captain in place Sri Lanka will be hoping for a change of fortunes.
As a player and a captain I will sacrifice my time and my effort to make sure Sri Lanka reclaims a good place. I need a little time for that, said Chandimal at his first pre-match press conference at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday. I am hopeful that with the players I have, I can take Sri Lankan cricket to where it used to be.
My final goal is to take the team to no. 1 in the world. We cant do that in one day or one year. We have to work hard with our cricket to get there. We have young players, and we have to give them experience along the way. We have to take it step by step  go to no. 6 first, then 5 and so on, he said.
Unlike in the ODIs, Sri Lanka have two quality and experienced spinners in their line up to worry the Zimbabwe batsmen in left-armer Rangana Herath and off-spinner Dilruwan Perera. Herath is the key to Sri Lankas chances of winning. It was he who destroyed the Zimbabwe batting when he led his country in the last Test series played between the two countries in Zimbabwe.
Herath scalped 19 wickets including 13 in one Test that gave his team a 2-0 clean sweep in the short series.
The Zimbabwe batsmen played very well particular during the five ODIs. We cant underestimate them. But we do have Rangana Herath in our Test team, who is an extremely experienced player, said Chandimal.
We also have Dilruwan Perera. I dont think we will let Zimbabwe get into rhythm too easily. We have plans against them, and we have good spinners. So Im hoping we can bowl well and restrict them.
With Test cricket returning to the R Premadasa Stadium after four years, Chandimal said, Sometimes it can be tough to identify the nature of a pitch completely. We think it will spin, but it wont spin as early as we think, or sometimes it will spin even before we have predicted. As a captain you have to be prepared to make those decisions. Thats a decision you make depending on the conditions.
In that context Chandimal said, When you look at the pitch, I think we will have to play seven batsmen and four bowlers. We also looked at the previous Tests here. Im not sure if well play two spinners and two quicks, or whether well go with three quicks and one spinner. Thats something for deciding tomorrow, after we get to the ground. But there is a big chance well go with two spinners and two quicks.
Chandimal confirmed that Upul Tharanga will open the batting with Dimuth Karunaratne and added, Probably we will have Asela Gunaratne among the seven batsmen as well, because he can bowl also, if we need him.
That could mean 26-year-old Danushka Gunathilaka who has played in 26 ODIs for his country will have to wait for his Test debut.

The Lankan line-up is expected to read like: Karunaratne, Tharanga, Mendis, Chandimal, Mathews, Gunaratne, Dickwella (wk), Herath, Perera, Lakmal, Chameera/Kumara.

SriLankan Airlines hosts Rumble in the Jungle mountain biking race
SriLankan Airlines held Sri Lankas premier mountain bike stage race, Rumble in the Jungle successfully for a third time in a row recently. The race takes riders from hot and humid jungles, through mountain hugging tea plantations and across the islands highest plateau.
Rumble in the Jungle not only succeeds in showcasing the vivid landscape of Sri Lanka but also promotes a carbon neutral sport to further cement the airlines commitment to become a carbon neutral airline in time to come.
This years race attracted over 35 riders from 15 different countries. It has become one of the most highly regarded races amongst the international mountain biking community.
Rumble in the Jungle is an annual cycling event that stretches out over four days. This race is not only competitive, but also offers a thrilling experience to international riders as they get an authentic local experience riding through the country.
Along the race, riders need to wade across rivers, ride through dense jungle, which is home to wild elephants, leopards and snakes, tackle over 1,000 metre climbs and negotiate bone clattering rocky descents.
Intense humidity, leeches, baking sun, torrential rain, mud, sand, rock and over 7000m of ascent combine to make this race the adventure of a lifetime, on one of the worlds most idyllic islands.
The first phase of race was from scenic Kuda Oya to Haputale, starting on the flat southern plains of the island, just 100m above sea level, entering virgin jungle where riders battled prickly and dense vegetation and tackled numerous river crossings.
Upon leaving the jungle, the route climbed rapidly for close to 30km before reaching the highest point of the day at 1650m, finally descending through working tea plantations to Haputale.
The next stage was centred around Haputale and Lipton's Loop and was characterized by a 1,200 metre descent over 16 km, mostly over super rough terrain, at the bottom of which was a verdant jungle. A brutal 700 metre climb, followed later by another 500 metre climb took riders back up to 1,850 metre above sea level for a final descent back into Haputale through working tea plantations.
The next stage stretched from Kalupahana to Nuwara Eliya, taking in Sri Lanka's highest waterfall, Bambarakanda; crossing the highest plateau, Horton Plains; and finishing in the highest town, Nuwara Eliya. This stage started with a 17 km, 1,300 metre climb, the majority of which is on rocky trail. At 2, 100 metres, once on the plateau, the temperature dropped dramatically and the area was shrouded in mist.The plains are host to a large Sambar deer population and home to one of the world's most endangered primates, the Slender Loris. A scintillating descent down from the plateau and another 17km ascent through the New Zealand farm brought riders into Nuwara Eliya.
The final leg of the race, the Ramdoda to Kandy stretch was Down Time, with over 2600m of descent. After a 20km, 900 metre descent group ride on the main road out of Nuwara Eliya, the race commenced from the Bluefield Tea plantation with a tough 8km, 500m ascent. After this it was practically all downhill for the next 48km, dropping 1100 metre through remote villages back into the lowlands. The race finished in Kandy.
At the end of the race in Kandy, the riders took the train to Colombo, where they gathered at the Galadari Hotel for the closing ceremony, during which the winners were announced by SriLankan Airlines.

Three-member committee to probe misuse of govt funds
A special three-member investigation committee was appointed by the North Western Provincial Council to investigate into the alleged misuse of government funds from the special fund set up for the eradication of Thalassemia from the NWP by 2020.
It is alleged that Rs. 10 million had been misused.
This fund was set up in 2009. Opposition Leader of the NWP-PC Shyamal Senerath requested the new NW Provincial Minister of Health Lakshman Wedaruwa to explain as to what has happened to the investigation report prepared on the misuse of funds allocated for this special fund.
Senerath asked the Provincial Minister of Health to table that investigation report before the NWP-PC meeting in due course.
Parents of children who suffer from Thalassemia in both Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts complain that the report has been hidden by authorities due to political influence.

Top experts share insights at LKI's foreign policy conference
A landmark dialogue on the theme 'Sri Lanka's Foreign Policy: Choices in a Changing World' was recently held at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies (LKI).
The two-day event drew established experts and new voices to examine Sri Lanka's foreign policy and present ideas and recommendations for its future.
The event began with a seminar on Emerging Issues in the Indian Ocean, supported by Hemas Holdings PLC, which presented the regional context of Sri Lanka's foreign policy.
It was followed by the Sri Lanka Foreign Policy Forum, where experts examined frameworks of Sri Lanka's foreign policy and the roles of key actors, including the Foreign Ministry, international organisations, media, and the private sector.
The panels of speakers also offered their insights on issues of energy security, trade and investment, geo-economics, maritime security, human rights, and international law.
Foreign Affairs Minister and Chairman of LKI Ravi Karunanayake delivered the opening address, presenting his vision for the future of Sri Lanka's foreign policy.
He said, Sri Lankan foreign policy must prioritise commercial diplomacy, take a clear stand for values that are in its long-term interest and embrace - not fear - digitalisation and the millennial generation.
The conference featured experts from Sri Lanka and overseas, including Dr. Radhika Coomaraswamy, former UN Under-Secretary General, Prof. Kanishka Jayasuriya from Murdoch University, Admiral Jayanath Colombage, former Commander, Sri Lankan Navy, Prof. Lailufar Yasmin from the University of Dhaka, Dr. Naazima Kamardeen of the University of Colombo, Prof. Natalie Klein from Macquarie University, Dr. Harsha Cabral, P.C., Member of the International Court of Arbitration, M. M. Jaffeer, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Daneshan Casie Chetty, former Ambassador, A.L.A. Azeez, Senior Director-General, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Nishan de Mel from Verite Research, Dr. Kadira Pethiyagoda, former Visiting Fellow at the Brookings Doha Centre, Dr. Sithara Fernando from the Sir John Kotelawala Defence University, Prof. Antony Anghie from the University of Utah and National University of Singapore, Dr. Farzana Haniffa from the University of Colombo, Dr. Rohan Samarajiva from LIRNEasia, Dr. Ram Manikkalingam from the Dialogue Advisory Group, Dinesha de Silva from the Asia Foundation, Deshal de Mel from Hayleys PLC, Namini Wijedasa from the Sunday Times, Daniel Alphonsus, former Media Secretary, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Dr. Lakshman Guruswamy from the University of Colorado.
Speaking at the seminar on Emerging Issues in the Indian Ocean, Mahdev Mohan, Assistant Professor at Singapore Management University and Nominated Member of Parliament in Singapore, observed that Sri Lanka's attempt to craft a dual identity as the centre of the Indian Ocean and a gateway to India would give it a competitive advantage - since it was a space that nobody had had the chance to exploit just yet.
Prof. Chin Leng Lim, Choh Ming-Li Professor-elect at the Chinese University of Hong Kong kicked off Sri Lanka's foreign policy forum with a keynote address on commercial diplomacy.
He cautioned against seeing Singapore's model of economic diplomacy as easily transposable to other states and recommended that states like Sri Lanka could opt for the Hong Kong solution in such circumstances - which was to distinguish itself from what's around - as Hong Kong and Dubai have both done.
During his presentation on Traditional Security and Great Power Interests in the Indian Ocean, Dr. David Brewster, Senior Research Fellow at the Australian National University, argued that China faced strong imperatives to promote freedom of navigation and a rules-based order in the Indian Ocean, and that countries in the region should think of ways to leverage those imperatives to their advantage.
Presenting on a panel on Emerging Security Issues Sashikala Premawardhane, Director General (Actg.), Ocean Affairs, Strategic Security and Policy Planning, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that there appeared to be resistance towards the idea of one country strategically dominating the Indian Ocean, due to the region's historically multipolar nature as well as the tendency of regional countries to avoid joining power blocs.
Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, Founding Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives, also shared his thoughts and was emphatic that Sri Lanka's goal to become the centre of the Indian Ocean could not succeed as long as Sri Lanka continues to have a schizoid relationship as far as India is concerned.
Commenting on Sri Lanka's export performance, Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja, Chair-Elect of the Global Economy Programme at LKI, stated that Sri Lanka's performance had actually been bucking the regional trend of a slowdown in exports, and that the restructuring of the Chinese economy could create new economic opportunities for Sri Lanka.
The high-profile event drew a diverse group of participants, including policymakers, scholars from universities and think tanks, the media, representatives from the private sector and civil society and students.
In explaining the aims of the event, LKI's Executive Director, Dr. Dinusha Panditaratne, stated that a primary objective was to consider how Sri Lanka's foreign policy might synthesize the new international order on the one hand, with the context of its domestic order - post 2009, and post 2015 - on the other.
LKI will be publishing a summary of the proceedings, along with an edited volume of papers from the foreign policy forum.
LKI is a think tank that analyses Sri Lanka's international relations and strategic interests, to provide insights and recommendations that advance justice, peace, prosperity, and sustainability. The Institute reflects the vision of the late Lakshman Kadirgamar by promoting the country's intellectual profile in foreign policy research and engagement.

Unique in every way!
At Trinity College ethics are taken very seriously. Indeed inculcating moral values is considered as one of the goals of practising drama at Trinity College. Dramatic Moves features the thespians of Trinity College, who value wit and proper conduct.
The Trinity College Literary Association, founded on March 19, 1875 by Andrew Loos, is the oldest society in school. The Drama Society is a segment of the TCLA. So to this date the TCLA is more than 140 years.
Master in Charge of Drama, Aslam Marika, highlighted how drama contributes to intellect.
Drama is everything about soft skills. I think when it comes to drama the boys have acquired good moral values. That is what we try to inculcate in the students doing drama. Our Principal Andrew Fowler Watt is a drama enthusiast. He did drama while he was in England. He is very conscious of getting more students involved in theater. We had a wonderful inter-house drama competition. The students passionately practicsd with wonderful props and costumes, said Marika.
Marika believes that the drama circuit as a whole is very challenging.
A lot of schools put in a lot of hard work to stage their productions. It is a good festive experience when you go to Colombo. We do enjoy ourselves. We have good memories of going down to Colombo. That is one of the plus sides to theater and traveling down to Colombo. It is a wonderful experience.
One aspect of drama is that there is a collision between good and bad. It is an opinion of good and bad always colliding. By doing different dramas, the boys are open to different aspects of how people perceive good and bad. It expands your intellect. It is easy to get things done with these boys because they are passionate and enthusiastic with what they want to do, stated Marika.
Meeting new people
President of the Trinity College Literary Association  2016, Shalitha Seneviratne feels Trinity have a pool of young talent which is very encouraging.
At the moment one of our strengths is our juniors. They are a young batch of actors who are being molded in the Middle School. We have seniors, even though they have left school they are still strength to us. Prior to the competition they help us with the directing and choreography. There are even seniors doing their A/Ls, who take their time to participate in competitions, said Seneviratne.
Seeing as to what is happening at the moment with the juniors stepping in, he feels drama at Trinity will continue to flourish.
Because like what Mr. Marikar said, the Principal is also focused on drama and we are having more competitions within school and we have identified new talent and we definitely have the potential to move forwards.
Doing drama is a wonderful experience. For me it was an experience that holds lot memories. Coming to the end of my school career I have done seven dramas and all seven dramas have stood out. When it comes to doing dramas you meet new people and you get this whole new experience and exposure. When you do drama you learn to go beyond what you can do. You improve the talent you have within you. When you do drama it unlocks a lot more than what you think you can do, so I would definitely encourage anyone to do drama. You will find a lot of friends. That experience will last a lifetime, so if you want that experience I would say do drama, explained Seneviratne.
Brotherhood
Treasurer of the Trinity College Literary Association - 2016, Manula Dissanayake spoke of the bond created between the boys.
When we get together to do drama and when we get to know each other, a special bond is created between us. Like a brotherhood. We start to understand each other. I think that is one of the main strengths we have. We do a lot of comedies and tragedies. But we are more understanding of the tragedies. We do much better in tragedies. Comedies is a bit hard when it comes to making a person laugh. When it comes to tragedies we tend to understand more of the play. So we do well in tragedies, said Dissanayake.
Drama teaches you moral ethics.
Through drama we find different characters. While acting we explore them. We debate on their actions. In that way we gain a greater understanding of society. It also give us discipline. To do drama you need a great deal of discipline. It also challenges our memory power, because when we memorize lines we need to do it in a short time. In an overall way it builds the character of a person. And this is vital when we go out into the society. It teaches us to work together, explained Dissanayake.
When it comes to playing a female character, we are not women! But what we can do is, get to know about the character and that can be the foundation and then you need to get in touch with your feminine side. If you are in touch with that, you can develop your character. Then you can go a long way, pointed out Dissanayake.
A challenge
Secretary of the Trinity College Literary Association  2017, Bilaal Marikar, felt that by doing drama you will not be disappointed and there is so much to be gained.
There are many juniors and seniors who are quite enthusiastic and they also work to develop their specific talents in drama. Recently we had the inter-school drama competition. We saw a huge pool of students come every day for practices, and they keep developing themselves. They are a very enthusiastic bunch of young people, said Marikar.
Definitely drama has prepared these boys to go out into the world.
As Mr. Marikar said it instills many moral values in yourself which prepares you to go out into the world. Because when you do drama it is not just going out there and acting on stage. It gives you much more than that.
I think when it comes to challenges one of the challenges might be going for competitions in the middle of examinations. Because sometimes the students find it hard to balance both activities. For me that has been quite a challenge but I manage to do both properly, stated Marikar.
Being able to perceive behavior traits in people can be gained by portraying characters.
Whenever I play a character I do a thorough background check, so I can actually get into his skin. For example the reasons behind his actions and why he is taking them What has affected him in the past to do what he is doing So that way it is easier for me to get into the character because I understand the character more. You also need to explore the society around him as well.
By exploring the minds of people, it prepares you for society, because you get a better understanding of why people behave the way they do and what challenges people might be facing. The values you have gained doing drama will never leave you and you can take it with you when you leave school, elucidated Marikar.
Having fun
Coordinator of the Trinity College Literary Association  2016, Tishan Kularatne felt that every play has been equally special.
Considering the plays that we have performed over the years, I cant specifically point out a most memorable one, because actually the whole point of drama is having fun and getting that exposure and experience. It is basically the festivity of it. It is an all-round molding of ones character.
When you think of all the Shakespeare Dramas that we have performed, each one has been quite memorable and every play has had its uniqueness. In my point of view there is no specific unforgettable drama. Everything has been really good.
Every drama that we have performed is a challenge. We try our best to always analyze the character and get into character. We try to get the maximum out of ourselves so the play can take place in a proper manner. Every play poses a new challenge. There is a huge difference between a tragedy and a comedy. So I will not be able to point out a specific hard play because every play has its own challenges, explained Kularatne.
He feels that his personal favorite from the Shakespearean plays he has done is that of Sir Toby from Twelfth Night. The specific scene where he is intoxicated having consumed alcohol is challenging, because to portray someone when you are not drunk and intoxicated is a challenge.
When it comes to chemistry between the boys, starting is the hard part. We know some people and we dont know some people. As the play goes on, we get to know people on a personal basis. We get to know their personalities. And we connect through the play. By the end of the drama we are one big family. There is a unique bond of brotherhood, added Kularatne.

Welikada Prison murders: Death threat to lawyer and witness
Magistrate orders obtaining phone records:
CID commences probe 4 years after in the wake of COA hearing:
The Attanagalla Magistrate yesterday issued an order to obtain the telephone records of Attorney at- Law Senaka Perera and eyewitness Sudesh Nandimal Silva, after they received death threats on Tuesday July 11.
Perera filed a writ petition before the Court of Appeal on April 4th seeking the courts intervention to order authorities to investigate the alleged massacre at the Welikada prison on November 9, 2012.
Speaking to the Daily News Police Spokesperson SP Ruwan Gunasekara said the Nittambuwa Police and the Thissamaharama Police had received complaints regarding the threat.
Lawyer Perera had filed a Police complaint CI 54/187 at the Nittambuwa Police after he received a call threatening him to desist from appearing in the case.
 I got a call between 7.30 and 7.45 p.m. and was told that my life would be in danger if I appear in this case. They wanted me to stop appearing.
Perera said his client also received a call from the same number on Tuesday night.
He is a key witness to the alleged massacre. They had also told him to stop following this he said. Nandimal Silva was an inmate on the date of the alleged massacre.
Twenty seven people were allegedly routinely killed on the night after the Special Task Force stormed into the Welikada prison premises. The inmates had initially resisted the intervention of the Police who had entered the prisons on the afternoon of November 9.
Thereafter, the STF was deployed and the massacre was said to have happened late in the night.
The Writ Petition filed, said that on the night inmates were dragged and shot by officers.
The petitioner saw Thushara being dragged to the floor and being shot near the gate. The petitioner had personally seen the body of Thushara next morning and the body had gunshot injuries in the neck. At about 6.00 am the petitioner and other prisoners saw Amila Malik Perera alias Konda Amila being taken in hand cuff and subsequently the petitioner got to know that Amila too had been killed the petition said.
Speaking to the Daily News, Attorney-at-Law Senaka Perera said he suspects the hearing at the Court of Appeal scheduled for July 28, may have been a reason for the threats.
What we have asked is for the CID to commence investigations because throughout this time they had done nothing.
Then suddenly they wake up and investigations are commenced because of the Writ petition. There has to be some connection between all of this he said.
The Petition alleged that the STF/TID/ Prison Intelligence and Army were involved in the murders.
Succesive commissions appointed to look into the alleged massacre have not been made public.
When questioned, Minister Justice Wijeydasa Rajapakshe said that action on the reports do not come under his purview.
You have to ask the Minister of Prisons. It does not come under my purview.
However, earlier, a second committee headed by retired High Court Judge Nimal Nambuwasam, was appointed by Minister Wijeydasa Rajapakshe on January 22, 2015. They handed over to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Justice Minister Rajapaksa June 9 2015, which is yet to be made public.
Attempts to contact Minister of Prison Refroms D.M. Swaminathan proved futile. However, in July last year Minister Swaminathan said that he was not aware of the incident (riot) and said that it came under the purview of the Justice Minister Rajapakshe.

Womens Collective wants Enforced Disappearance Bill enacted
A collective of women from the North and East have called for the government to enforce domestic legislation to criminalise enforced disappearances regardless of various attempts by extremists to stall the passing of such legislature.
We, as conflict affected women and victims, have searched for disappeared loved ones and witnessed thousands of others searching for their loved ones.
Many have gone before numerous state initiatives including several commissions of inquiry appointed by successive governments with no answers given or effective steps taken to prevent future disappearances. We were heartened by the Government of Sri Lankas ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance in May 2016 and looked forward to domestic legislation being introduced to criminalize enforced disappearances in Sri Lanka and make it meaningful locally, read the statement released by the women yesterday.
In February 2017, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill was gazetted and we waited for Parliament to debate and thereby criminalise disappearances. On 5th July, we were disappointed to hear of the indefinite postponement of the debate without any reasons given.We believe the Bill is essential for reconciliation as it will prevent future disappearances, end impunity and ensure that no loved ones will have to experience the pain many have experienced for decades, noted further the statement signed by 396 women.
We are also aware that several actors are spreading false information of the proposed law and attempting to prevent the Bill being taken up for debate. Such persons through their actions are effectively sending the message that no action should be taken on enforced and involuntary disappearances and thereby promoting the culture of impunity.
We are indeed saddened by such irresponsible statements and action, as it shows that many are unaware of the pain and suffering caused by disappearances to families and communities and are encouraging a crime that has a devastating impact and perpetuates the suffering faced by thousands across Sri Lanka, in the north, south, east and west, it added. We believe criminalizing disappearances in Sri Lanka is a critical step in this process. Therefore, we call on the Government of Sri Lanka and political leaders to take a firm stand on a crime that has been unaddressed for too many years and to take immediate steps to debate and enact the Bill into Sri Lankan law.
Such a measure will provide confidence to us and the many affected persons in all communities that genuine steps are finally being taken to stop future disappearances and ensure non-recurrence, read the statement.

The last time Zimbabwe won a Test match was four years ago at Harare when they defeated Pakistan by 24 runs. The architects of that victory were Hamilton Masakadza (75 and 44) and fast bowler Tendai Chatara who took 5 for 61 and ran through the Pakistan batting in the second innings.
Masakadza and Chatara are both members of the current Zimbabwe side taking on Sri Lanka in the one-off Test at the R Premadasa Stadium today.
Captain Graeme Cremer will expect these two players to play a similar role if Zimbabwe are to compete with Sri Lanka. Mazakadza with 32 Test caps is the most experienced cricketer in the Zimbabwe line up and he comes into the Test match fresh from being named Man of the Series after his countrys historic 3-2 triumph over Sri Lanka in the one-day series.
Confidence more than anything and self belief is what we are taking from the ODI series into the Test match most, said Cremer. That we can actually push Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka is big for us. We have the potential to score the runs as well as take wickets.
Definitely Test cricket is a different format and we havent played Test cricket for a little while but we have the quality in our team to adapt. Obviously theres a lot more time spent in the Test match especially with the batting, well still keep our scoring options open.
Its just about being a bit smarter when we are out there and assess the conditions, the pitch we are not quite sure about well have another look today. If we can assess conditions quicker we should be okay, he said.
Cremer said that his team is aware of the threat posed by left-arm spinner Rangana Herath who has been their nemesis.
We know he is a quality bowler he is someone that Sri Lanka really rely on to pick up wickets, said Cremer. Weve just spoken about how he tries to get people out both left-handers and right-handers. The guys have all come up with their own individual plans on how to play him. We definitely know he is a threat and he will be someone we need to keep out if we are to do well in the Test match.
Zimbabwes strong point has been spin and it is with that they hope to take a lot of Sri Lankan wickets.
We rely a lot on our spinners which have always been our wicket-taking option. We have had a few injuries Carl Mumba is struggling still with a knee which is a setback for us. Weve still got guys who can step up and do it because we are spin heavy in our team, said Cremer.
Zimbabwe spinners (Waller, Raza, Cremer and Williams) took 15 of the 24 wickets to fall in the ODI series.
With Zimbabwe getting to play Tests few and far between Cremer said it was not easy to adjust to the five-day game when you dont play it consistently.
You can see that when we play a lot of cricket we are a different team. We sometimes struggle when we go three, four, five months without a series which can be tough. Its not easy just to walk up there and play well against top teams. If we can get a lot more cricket against good opposition it will help our cricket, Cremer said.
In the last six years since returning to Test cricket in 2011 after a six year hiatus, Zimbabwe has played only 18 Tests. They have played so little Test cricket that they lie at the bottom of the rankings with no points.
