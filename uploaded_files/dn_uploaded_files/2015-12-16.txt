Arrest of intelligence officers wont harm national security
The arrest of 11 retired intelligence officers in connection with the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda will not affect national security, Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena told Parliament yesterday. He assured that no classified information pertaining to national security would be leaked or disclosed as a result of the investigation.
State Minister Wijewardena made these observations in response to a question raised by UPFA Parliamentarian Jayantha Samaraweera.
The 11 Army personnel and intelligence operatives were arrested in connection with the disappearance of Prageeth Ekneligoda. Out of the 11, four were serving officers (one officer released), four retired officer (two retired officers released) and three intelligence operatives (all three released), the minister said.
When MP Samaraweera compared the situation to the Millennium City incident, Minister said this situation could not be compared to the Millennium City incident as this was an incident involving a crime. He said he discussed the matter with intelligence officers.
They assured that this investigation has no negative effect on national security, Wijewardena said.
Marshy lands help lower Colombo temperature - Patali
The temperature in the Colombo city is five degree lower than it should have been, thanks to the network of low lying marshy
lands around Colombo, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said in Parliament yesterday.
The minister said this in response to a special statement made by DNA MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake who questioned whether steps were taken to compensate more than 2000 families affected as their lands were acquired for the Weras Ganga drain water collection project.
He said around 30 percent of lands in the Colombo district are low lying areas. Due to the haphazard reclamation of the low lying lands and unplanned urbanization, even minor rain can cause floods in Colombo. The Weras ganga project was designed to solve this, minister Ranawaka said.
Twenty acres of fallow paddy lands in Papiliyana and 30 acres paddy lands in Pillawa not cultivated for several years were again cultivated due to this project, he said.
Governmentdemocratises budget - Eran
The government democratised the budget which had been privatized by the previous regime, Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne told in Parliament yesterday.
This is the difference between the previous regime and the present government. Now, anybody can criticise the budget and make proposals as there is a government sensitive to the thoughts of the public. Being more democratic doesnt mean that the government is weak. That is why the second reading of the budget was passed with the 2/3 majority, he said.
Wickramaratne said the Budget 2016 will be passed with a large majority on Saturday.
Sri Lankan Air Lines has recorded a loss of Rs.128 billion which is 15 times higher than the amount allocated to Samurdhi beneficiaries. The people have to pay for the loss making institutions. Mihin Lanka has recorded a loss of Rs. 16 billion, he said.
Protecting the capital and the depositor is the main responsibility of bankers. International rules and regulations are applied to the banks. If the term, bank, is used with Divi Neguma, it should be under the supervision of the Central Bank. The banking system should not be politicised, he said.
Some Bankers engaged in a strike. But the trade unions of the UNP, SLFP or the JVP were not involved in the strike. Only one trade union was engaged in the strike. I condemned the decision taken by bank officers to hold a strike when the budget has not been passed, Wickramaratne said.
More graduates to be recruited to govt. service
The government will recruit 5,500 graduate development officers within the next two months, Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara told Parliament yesterday.
The minister was joining the committee stage debate of the budget under the Public Administration and Management Ministry financial head.
Steps will be taken to assign specified task to public servants from next year. The public service capacity building is key to improve the efficiency of the public service, the minister said.
Public servants were provided with massive benefits this year. Salaries were increased by Rs.10,000 while pension scheme anomalies were rectified. Four hundred graduates were recruited as management trainees. Rs. 2,000 of Rs. 10,000 allowance given to the
public sector employees will be added to their basic salaries from the beginning of the next year, he said.
There will be no reduction in the pension payment. For those who join the public service from 2016, there will be a contributory pension scheme, Madduma Bandara said.
Programme to nab jail breakers
A special programme is being implemented to nab prison escapees and bring them back to prisons, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan told Parliament yesterday
He made this observation in Parliament in response to a question for oral answers raised by UNP Parliamentarian Buddhika Pathirana.
He said,67 prisoners have fled the custody of prison officers by July 31. We have arrested 23 of them. Search operations are underway to nab the rest.
Meanwhile, steps have been taken to prevent the entry of narcotics to prisons. Sniffer dogs have been deployed to prevent smuggling drugs into prisons, Swaminathan said.
PM warns Marikkar
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday warned S.M. Marikkar to be disciplined in the House.
The Prime Minister warned Marikkar when the latter started to make remarks while the Prime Minister was responding to a point of order raised by Opposition member Vasudeva Nanayakkara querying as to when the No Confidence Motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake be taken up in Parliament.
When Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was saying there was no point of moving the No Confidence Motion as the second reading stage of budget was passed with a two thirds majority, S.M. Marikkar was making remarks looking at Opposition members.
At this stage, the Prime Minister told MP Marikkar to be silent and listen.
Deputy Speaker and Sujeewa Senasinghe in verbal battle
A heated argument broke out in Parliament yesterday between presiding Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala and International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe.
The incident happened while State Minister Senasinghe was speaking at the committee stage debate of the budget proposals under the financial heads of the Industry and Commerce Ministry and Public Enterprise Development Ministry.
State Minister Senasinghe said during the previous regime, Rohitha Abeygunawardena could not make appointments to the Ports Authority without Namals approval to which Abeygunawardena responded and said it was untrue.
At this stage, opposition members, including Abeygunawardena and Mahindananda Alutgamage, shouted at Senasinghe. However Senasinghe said he would show a letter written by Abeygunawardena seeking the approval of Namal to make an appointment.
However, Abeygunawardena challenged Minister Senasinghe to table the copy.
Minister Senasinghe said he didnt have the copy of the letter but could procure some other day.
However, Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala told the State Minister if he continued to mention the names of members often, they had to be given the chance to respond.
You should not tell me what to speak, State Minister Senasinghe said.
You maintain the order of Parliament. Ill decide what to speak, the Deputy Speaker said.
At this stage, Deputy Speaker Sumathipala asked him to sit.
I am on my feet why should I sit, the State Minister said.
I order you for the second time to sit. If you dont do so, I will order for the third time and will force you to sit, the Deputy Speaker said.
State Minister Senasinghe was silent. He was allowed to continue the speech.
I request to allow me to speak. I am on my feet. I challenge the opposition in accordance with the standing orders and regulations, State Minister Senasinghe said.
I dont object opposition members being permitted to respond, he said.
Deputy Speaker Sumathipala mentioned that State Minister Senasinghe had only two more minutes to speak and a member from the opposition side was heard saying he was ready give two minutes out of his time.
Errant traders to be rounded up
Traders who continue to sell essential commodities at prices higher than those specified in the budget 2016, will be raided from this week, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said yesterday.
We have received information that certain traders are trying to create an artificial shortage of essential items without passing the benefits from the budget to consumers targeting the forthcoming festive season, the minister said.
Addressing the media-briefing held at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday, the minister said that there is no room to create an artificial scarcity of essential items by resorting to hoarding and other malpractices due to the price decrease in essential commodities through the budget.
He said measures are in place to ensure enough essential food items in the market.
Rural Economic Development Minister P. Harrison said the Yahapalana government provided reliefs to the people by reducing the
prices of 12 essential commodities through the budget. But the people said they have not received benefits.
That is why we want to conduct raids and nab traders who do not pass the benefit of the concessions to consumers. We have called tenders for the sale of excess rice stored at the Paddy Marketing Board for Rs. 40 a kilo. However, the rice mafia created by a few companies tried to sabotage the move. We will sell rice at Rs.42 a kilo to a foreign company and send money to the Treasury. The Cost Of Living Committee headed by Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama will meet once a week to provide more relief to the people, minister Harrison said.
Some clauses of Prevention of Terrorism Act in Penal Code - Vijitha Herath
Measures have been taken to include some clauses of the Prevention of Terrorism Act in the Penal Code, which is ordinary law. This situation is more dangerous than the previous one, said JVP MP Vijitha Herath told in Parliament yesterday.
There was a long process to take a person into custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. By including these clauses in the common law, any person could be arrested easily under the ordinary law, he said.
He was joining the committee stage debate of the budget proposals 2016 for the 11th allotted day held under the financial heads of Public Administration, Industry and Commerce and Public Enterprise Development.
He proposed the government to continue paying Rs.6,000 as a monthly payment to July strikers without paying Rs.250,000 as was proposed in the Budget proposals 2016. He said the government has not provided suitable jobs for newly recruited degree holders. Though a circular with regard to this has been issued, the government failed to implement it, he said.
He said a service constitution should be in place to enable public servants to get promotion through examinations and service experience.
Tamil speakers must be recruited to upcountry areas - Radhakrishnan
Tamil speaking officers must be recruited to upcountry areas as a solution to the problems faced by them due to the language barrier, Education State Minister V. Radhakrishnan told in Parliament yesterday.
He was joining the committee stage debate of the budget proposals 2016 for the 11th allotted day held under the financial heads of Public Administration, Industry and Commerce and Public Enterprise Development.
He said up-country people have confident on the government and the Budget 2016.
He said Divisional Secretariat Divisions should be properly administrated. The lack of Grama Niladaris has become a barrier to find
solutions for people issues, he said.
TNA MP Thurairethnasingam said some government officers dont understand the grievances of the people. They have to face hardships due to the language issue, he said.
Responsibilities and the work load of Grama Niladharis are increasing. The government should take measures to recruit Grama Niladharis to the areas where there are many families attached to one Grama Niladari, he said.
Radhakrishnan said Tamil speaking registrars should be recruited to avoid incorrect registrations of Births, Deaths and Marriages.
People have no confidence in budget - Mahindananda
People have no confidence in the Budget 2016. The government has presented five budgets within a month, UPFA MP Mahindananda Alutgamage told in Parliament yesterday.
He was joining the committee stage debate of the budget proposals held for the 11th allotted day under the financial heads of the Public Administration and Management Ministry, Industry and Commerce Ministry and Enterprise Development Ministry.
The trade union action scheduled to be held on 17th had been called off by two trade union activists who support the government. The Prime Minister is trying to dilute the public service which is essential to a poor country like ours, he said.
Alutgamage said around 44 state institutions had been privatised by the UNP from 2001 to 2004. They have laid the foundation for the second phase of the privatisation of state institutions, he said.
Strengthen public service - Prasanna Ranatunga
Measures should be taken to strengthen the public service. Privileges enjoyed by the public servants should be provided for them, UPFA MP Prasanna Ranatunga told in Parliament yesterday.
Joining the committee stage debate of the budget proposals 2016 for the 11th allotted day held under the financial heads of Public Administration, Industry and Commerce and Public Enterprise Development, Ranatunga said the people expected cost of living reduction, but it has gone up.
Public servants lost their privileges. I urge the government to fulfill the promises made prior to the election, he said.
He said the Judges of the courts and university academics do not get anything other than the salary. The government should reconsider these issues, he said.
UNP governments gave priority to privatisation. People are reluctant to join the public sector due to the fear of losing privileges, he said.
He urged the government to treat the workers of the central government and provincial government equally.

A 21st-century Ellis Island emerges in Greece
GREECE: With its aqua-blue waters, olive-tree-studded hills and well-preserved ancient ruins, this jewel in the Aegean Sea can hardly be compared to an island built of landfill in the mouth of New York Harbor.
Yet in a year of unparalleled migration to Europe, Lesbos has been transformed from a quietly sublime slice of paradise to a modern-day Ellis Island. It's the first port of call for a multiethnic, multinational tide of humanity seeking relief from war, persecution and poverty - the funnel through which thousands pass daily in search of a better life.
In recent months, the extraordinary pace of landings here has rivaled the historic peaks on the island that for decades formed the main gateway to the United States and that is still known worldwide as a byword for immigration.
But unlike Ellis Island, which was developed by the U.S. government specifically to process new arrivals, Lesbos's role has emerged largely by happenstance. The solutions to the crisis are a patchwork thrown together by aid organizations, volunteers and local authorities, with comparatively little evidence of help from the Greek government or the European Union.
"Who's in charge" said Lani Fortier, who leads the International Rescue Committee's efforts in Lesbos. "There's no answer."
Despite recent improvements that have calmed a situation once defined by chaos and squalor, the infrastructure here for welcoming, screening and registering people on their way into Europe remains inadequate given expectations of another surge in numbers come spring.
Lesbos's emergence as a global migration centre, officials here say, was no short-term anomaly.
"This will continue for another two or three years - at least," said Marios Andriotios, spokesman for a beleaguered municipal government that has been crying out for help for much of this year. "We didn't choose to be a hot spot in this crisis. The smugglers chose Lesbos." Of the nearly 1 million refugees and migrants who have arrived in Europe by sea this year, 800,000 have come through the Greek islands. More than half of those have landed on Lesbos. That compares with just over 1 million arrivals during Ellis Island's busiest year, 1907.

Amendments to the budget effect govt. revenue by Rs 7 billion
The amendments proposed to the Budget 2016 by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will result in a Rs. 7 billion impact on the Government revenue, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake informed Parliament.

The minister added he would brief the House as to how this income would be recovered when the Budget concludes on December 19. The minister was responding to a supplementary question by UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena.

The minister noted the allocations for development purposes or relief measures would not be curtailed to facilitate additional allocations required for the proposed amendments.

The Budget is not something ingrained on stone. What the Prime Minister was flexible enough to incorporate the proposals of various segments in the society. Various proposals come in the Committee Stage of the Budget and we need to consider them. Even if you make constructive proposals that benefit the country which are not extreme, we are ready to accommodate them as well he replied.

The minister said the Prime Minister had made 4 proposals while President Maithripala Sirisena made a proposal with regard to excise tax. The Presidents proposal actually increases the revenue by Rs 250 million. If the GMOA insists on the car permit, what we will have to be provided through the allocation made to the Health Ministry he said.

MP Gunawardena asked the minister to submit a report to Parliament clarifying how the Government is going to revise the budgetary allocations to accommodate the amendments proposed by the Prime Minister.

Meanwhile the Finance Minister replying to another supplementary question by MP Gunawardena stated the Government is not dictated by the IMF policy, but it follows what it thinks best for the people of the country.

At the same time we must be sensitive to external threats as ISIS too. I am confident that dollars will flow in to the country after the Budget. There is no issue with the balance of payment. The issue is with the trade deficit. To control it we need to take effective steps to reduce the imports and increase the exports he added.

The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) charges that the proposed amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code will cause communal and ethnic harmony. BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera said said the BBS would not allow the Bill to be passed in Parliament.
Speaking to the media Gnanasara Thera said in all probability, the Bill had been prepared at the request of an NGO, to harm the ethnic and religious harmony of the country. He said the Bill will be used against the media and political freedom of the country. He said the bill would destroy the Sinhala Buddhist leadership.
The three Chief Incumbents said they were not aware of the Bill. Legal experts know nothing about the Bill," he said, accusing the Bill of being drafted and tabled in the parliament secretly.
Convener Dr. Dilantha Withana said there was no difference between the Bill and Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). The BBS said it would conduct countrywide awareness campaigns to protest the Bill.

Dhoni, McCullum fetch million dollar deals in IPL draft
Delhi, Tuesday : Indian and New Zealand skippers Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Brendon McCullum were drafted for more than one million dollars into new cricket teams on Tuesday for the Indian Premier League following a graft scandal.
A new team from the western city of Pune paid 125 million rupees (US $ 1.8 million) for limited overs captain Dhoni for the next edition of the lucrative Twenty20 tournament.
Dhoni joins Australian captain Steven Smith who was sold for 55 million rupees ($820,000) and South African Twenty20 captain Faf du Plessis who went for 40 million rupees ($597,000) on the same team.
The other franchise from the western city of Rajkot chose McCullum for 75 million rupees ($1.1 million), James Faulkner for 55 million rupees ($820,000) and West Indian Dwayne Bravo for 40 million rupees ($597,000).
The franchises have replaced Chennai Super Kings and the Rajasthan Royals -- teams banned from the glitzy tournament for two years on the recommendation of a Supreme Court-appointed panel, after a corruption scandal.

They were allowed to choose five stars from each of the banned teams, while the rest were released into a pool for auction.
Australia's Shane Watson and Mike Hussey, South Africa's Chris Morris and the West Indies' Dwayne Smith remain unsold and will now be auctioned in Bangalore in February.
The 2013 IPL season was mired in controversy after police launched legal proceedings against several officials from the teams and three Rajasthan Royals' players for illegal betting and spot-fixing.
Suresh Raina, who played for the Chennai Super Kings alongside Dhoni, fetched 125 million rupees from Rajkot which also chose all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja.
"Excited to play for the beautiful vibrant city- Rajkot in @IPL. Looking forward to have new teammates and support from the people of Gujarat," Raina tweeted.
Indian batsman Ajinkya Rahane and spinner R Ashwin were picked by Pune for 95 million and 75 million rupees.
Both Chennai and Rajasthan are expected to return to the IPL after their bans end following the 2017 edition.

Kalutara National Freedom Front (NFF) MP Jayantha Samaraweera accused the amendments to the Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code of being divisive, and said that his party would strongly oppose it. He said the amendments would cause conflict between ethno-religious groups, and added that 2016 Budget was a strange one.
Speaking to the media in Colombo yesterday, he urged people oppose the proposed amendments for the love of their country. He said that if the amendments went ahead, teachers would soon not be able to teach history lessons in school. The poems of Tibetan monks and Christmas carols would soon be banned because they would be deemed racial, he said.
He said that right now, a person could walk from Dondra Head to Point Pedro chanting Buddhist prayers and walk back from Point Pedro to Dondra Head chanting Hindu prayers, and not be disturbed: With the changes to the Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code, there would no longer be the freedom to do this, he charged.
Speaking on the 2016 Budget, he said it would destroy the economy of Sri Lanka, and that the people's aspirations would not be realised.

Fear of sickness leads to 'Angelina Jolie' syndrome
RUSSIA: Highly commercialised standards of health and beauty can lead to the 'Angelina Jolie' syndrome - taking preventive action, such as surgery on a healthy body, for a hypothetical disease, researchers have claimed.
The politicisation and commercialisation of health issues in today's Western culture have led to growing healthism - a peremptory idea of self-preserving behaviour.
This approach criticises everything that fails to fit into the glamorous standards of a beautiful, young and slim body, researchers said.
In extreme forms, healthism is close to eugenics, which selects a 'correct' heredity.
However, even simple concerns about the 'standards' of physical condition may provoke hypercorrection, such as surgery on a healthy body, said Evgenia Golman, from the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) in Russia.
Angelina Jolie syndrome has been frequently mentioned in the media recently, implying increased attention to the probability of dangerous diseases, researchers said.
The famous case of the Hollywood actress, who underwent a preventive mastectomy, is symptomatic of this obsession and fits into the healthism concept.
However, Jolie's story is an extreme manifestation of the 'new understanding of health'. More widespread displays of healthism include the boom in diets, fitness, plastic surgery and organic food, as well as the popularity of mobile apps for health monitoring.
Such 'body worship' is extensively supported by beauty salons, manufacturers of 'superhealthy' food, fitness and yoga centres, and even healthcare officials in many countries.
Popular healthcare policy today often shifts the responsibility for health from healthcare institutions to individuals themselves, and shifts the focus from treatment to prevention, including prevention of even purely hypothetical pathologies, Golman said. Preventive medicine undoubtedly helps prevent many diseases and can saves a lot of resources for families.

Final voting confirms winner in New Zealand flag referendum
NEW ZEALAND: A flag with a silver fern on a black-and-blue background was confirmed Tuesday as New Zealand's preferred option if the country decides to replace its current standard that features Britain's Union Jack.
The counting of late and overseas votes from a recent referendum on the New Zealand flag confirmed the preliminary results released last week, electoral commission officials said.
There were five options to choose from and an identical design flag in a slightly different colour scheme was actually the most popular first choice.
But under New Zealand's preferential voting system, where people ranked the five designs in order of favouritism, the silver fern flag with a black, white and blue background was the most popular overall. The winning design will go head-to-head with the existing flag in a second referendum in March 2016 to determine if New Zealand changes its national banner. "This is a historically significant choice we have in front of us," deputy Prime Minister Bill English said. "We now have some time to consider the two flags side by side and have a good think about which one of them best represents us as a nation now and into the future." Prime Minister John Key has led the push for reform, saying the existing ensign is a colonial relic that is too easily confused with Australia's flag.

'Hibaku' rice grown to recall horror of atomic bombing
JAPAN: Hibaku rice tasseled again this year in various parts of Japan as a "living witness" to the horror of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki 70 years ago.
The rice is derived from seeds collected in October 1945 by Kyushu University researchers in areas close to the hypocenter of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki just before the end of World War II in August of that year.
Hibaku (exposure to radiation) rice looks healthy, though greener than normal. But its husks are "almost empty," Kikuo Sakai, 81, said in early October, pointing to the rice grown in a 100-sq.-meter plot in his rice paddy in Motomiya, Fukushima Prefecture.
"The taste isn't good," added his wife, Ko, 76.
Sakai learned about the hibaku rice seeds from a farming magazine and began growing it, not for sale but to remember relatives who went to war and never returned, and the acute food shortages experienced in Japan during and after WWII.

KARACHI: Many of the Pakistani players who went to Bangladesh to appear in the Bangladesh Premier League return home with bitter memories and unhappy at being sidelined by the team owners and management.
Foremost among them is Pakistan's test captain Misbah-ul-Haq who was sidelined by the Rangpur Riders management for his team's last seven matches while preference was given to other foreign signings including Afghanistan's little known Muhammad Nabi.
"I can't say much on this but I guess the team owners and coaches know what is required. But it is not easy sitting on the bench for so long," Misbah said just before his team's knockout game on Sunday night.
Misbah clearly looked upset at his continued exclusion even for the knockout match against Barissal Bulls. His omission has surprised many in the Pakistan cricket circles while others like Kamran Akmal, Saeed Ajmal, Umar Akmal and Wahab Riaz have also returned home not happy at being given the cold shoulder treatment.
"I had made it clear to my franchise owners and management that I wanted to open in the BPL but after just two matches I didn't get any proper response," Kamran said.
"I didn't go there only for the money I went there as I thought the BPL would allow me to further remind the selectors I am doing well," he said.
Pakistan's fast bowler Wahab also decided it was better to return home midway through the BPL and walk the ramp in Lahore than sit and waste his time in Dhaka.
"Obviously it is not easy to be ignored like this for majority matches. It has been tough on Misbah but he has handled himself well," Wahab who also appeared for Rangpur said.
Wahab had joined the BPL on December 1st after the Pakistan and England series along with Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik, Ahmed Shehzad, Umar Akmal, Sohail Tanvir and Muhammad Hafeez.
Fast bowler Sohail Khan also got just one match for Dhaka Gladiators during his three week stay in Bangladesh while Pakistan's spin stalwart Saeed Ajmal was also played in just two matches and then dumped on the sidelines.
A total of around 17 players from Pakistan were signed by the BPL franchises but only left arm pacer Muhammad Aamir enjoyed himself playing in all their matches for Chittagong PTI

Putin and other ex-KGB have 'gunslinger's gait,' says study
RUSSIA: Russian President Vladimir Putin walks with a curious "gunslinger's gait" -- a reduced swing in his right arm which he may have acquired through KGB weapons training, an unusual study published Monday said.
The research, published in the British medical journal The BMJ, was written by a team of neurologists in Portugal, Italy and the Netherlands.
Specialists in analysing postures and movements that are potential signs of health disorders, they say they were struck by Putin's "distinct" way of walking.
Video footage shows that when Putin walks, his left arm swings normally but his right arm barely moves.
Asymmetrical movement like this is often a telltale sign of Parkinson's disease.
But the doctors found no other symptoms of this disease in Putin, such as tremor, rigidity or poor coordination.
Quite the opposite, in fact: they found he had "excellent motor skills," as a judo black belt, weight lifter and swimmer, and his handwriting is fast and signature tremble-free.
But their investigations turned up an intriguing alternative explanation in the form of a training manual used by the former Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
The manual, which they had translated into Dutch, instructs operatives to keep their weapon in their right hand close to their chest and move forward with one side -- usually the left -- "turned somewhat in the direction of movement."
The idea behind this approach is to let the agent draw a gun as quickly as possible when confronted with a foe.
Wondering whether prolonged and intensive training in this method could explain Putin's gait, as he was a KGB operative in the Cold War, the team carried out a trawl on YouTube for videos of other Russian officials.
The researchers were "stunned" by what they saw, said Bastiaan Bloem, a professor of movement disorder neurology at Radboud University Medical Centre in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, who led the study.
They also found the characteristic walk in Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, in two former defence ministers -- Anatoly Serdyukov and Sergei Ivanov -- and in Anatoly Sidorov, a senior military commander.
Putin and Ivanov are both former KGB officials, while Serdyukov and Sidorov received military training, the study notes.
Medvedev, in contrast, does not have clear links to either the military or the KGB.
Why, then, would he walk like Putin The possible answer, says the study: he wants to imitate the boss.
"Substantial evidence suggests that Medvedev is being coached to sound, look, and importantly, walk like the president," it says.

Self-reliant, stable system for electricity
Our objective is to provide an efficient and uninterrupted supply of electricity to the people, by creating a self-reliant and stable electricity generation system, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitya said. He said this while on tour to inspect the mini 40 kw hydro-electricity scheme in Induruwa, Ruwanwella on December 14.
The minister said the Induruwa hydroelectricity scheme would be a model for those interested in learning about renewable energy generation.
He said that under the previous regime permits for energy generation had been sold for a quick buck by middlemen. He said the new government had introduced a proposal in the 2016 budget to cancel the permits of those who had obtained permits before January 1 2015, but failed to show progress by December 31 this year.
He said this was to clean up and eliminate foul play in the sector, the result of which would be the availability of electricity to all without hassle.

TNA wants new 'hate speech' legislation withdrawn
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) issuing a press statement yesterday, urged the government to withdraw the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill placed on the Order Paper of Parliament.
The communique stated that the TNA strongly opposes the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill on the grounds that it is inconsistent with Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, which guarantees to every citizen the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression including publication.
The Bill was placed on the Order Paper by Justice Minister Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapakshe on December 11, 2015.
The statement added: "The TNA is deeply concerned about the proposed Bill. The Bill seeks to introduce a new provision (Section 291C) to the Penal Code, No. 11 of 1887. A further Bill seeking to amend the Criminal Procedure Code Act, No. 15 of 1979 was also placed on the Order Paper.
"We observe that the proposed Section 291C is nearly identical to Section 2(1)(h) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act No. 48 of 1979 (PTA). The previous government used this very provision to target persons from the Tamil and Muslim communities and to deprive them of their freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution."
It also observed that the government's move to amend Section 291C of the Penal Code directly contravenes its commitment made at the previous UNHRC session 'to review and repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act, and to replace it with anti-terrorism legislation in accordance with contemporary international best practices'.
"We note that Sri Lanka is already compliant with international standards with respect to hate speech. Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act, No. 56 of 2007 provides: 'No person shall propagate war or advocate national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence.' Section 3(1) of the ICCPR Act reproduces Article 20 of the ICCPR, and is therefore compliant with international standards. The High Court is vested with jurisdiction to try offenders under this Act. We also recall that the Sri Lankan Supreme Court, in its Advisory Opinion in S.C. Reference No. 1 of 2008, referred to Section 3 of the ICCPR Act in the context of 'legislative compliance' with Article 20 of ICCPR. Therefore, there is absolutely no need to introduce new legislation on hate speech," the communique stated.
