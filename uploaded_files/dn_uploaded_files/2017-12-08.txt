Army Chief has a point
Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senananayake, it is reported, had advised his officers not to take to politics, after retirement. Addressing troops, at the Kilinochchi Military Headquarters, on Thursday, Lt. Gen Senanayake had said that bearing in mind the war, and, incidents, they should not get involved in politics, under any circumstances, after retirement. The Army Chief, of course, may have justifiable grounds for this important advice proffered to his officers and men.
To begin with, unlike in its ceremonial days, the Army, today, had acquired a huge reputation, and, its men are lionized, and, revered for their role in defeating an enemy, which was described as the most ruthless terrorist outfit in the world, and, decidedly unbeatable. Ditto for the men of the other two arms of the security forces! On the other hand, politics has today become a dirty word to the majority of the populace, and, politicians, of all varieties, held in utmost contempt. By throwing in their lot with politicians, the members of the armed forces can only erode their reputation, and, standing, among the public, to put it mildly, which may have been the thought process governing the thinking, of the Army Commander.
Of course, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka has already taken the plunge. But this could well be under exceptional circumstances, in the wake of the hostility, and, maltreatment he was subjected to, by the Rajapaksas, soon after the war victory, under his leadership, and, his plunge into politics may have been as a result of the urge to strike back.
On the whole, though, most would agree with the Army Commander's thinking against retired officers entering politics of the type that is practiced today. It is difficult to picture a former decorated military officer sitting in parliament in the company of types that are commonly been accused of corruption, or, to be identified with a breed who have been described as bootleggers, murderers, chain snatchers, cattle thieves et al., or, a bunch of uneducated louts, a good majority of whom had failed their GCE O/L exams.
Of course, there were military officers aplenty, who took to politics, after retirement. The names of Sir Richard Udugama, Major Montague Jayawickrema, Captain C.P.J. Seneviratne, and, last, but not least, Sir John Kotelawala, come to mind. However there was a difference. Politics, during that era was not the cesspit that it is today, and, sullied by sleaze. Parliament was adorned by intellectuals, philanthropists, landed proprietors, retired civil servants and men with titles. If ever the term gentlemanly politics came to be applied, it was, without doubt, in that bygone era. Hence, retired members of the armed forces stepping into politics would not have been an issue at the time.
However, given the huge transformation that has taken place, both, in the political, and, social landscape, values and attitudes, too, have undergone a sea change. Things that were once considered commonplace are viewed with a different perspective, in the present day.
A retired member of the security forces entering politics today will not only lose for him the respect of the vast majority of the general public, but also aspersions cast on the army as a whole. Politics, which was once a honourable calling that had at its core, service to the public, had become so repugnant to the vast majority, that, professionals, intellectual, or, individuals with social standing, have shunned it like the plague. Why then should retired military officers, who fought for the country, decorated for valour, and, have their honour to protect, sully their selves, and, the military they served, by throwing in their lot with a set of morons, reviled by the public
The government, for its part, too should not encourage retired military personnel, or, ex-police officers, to join politics. Today, most political parties nominate former military officers, as candidates, at elections, as a vote catching device. But, more often than not, these candidates fail to get elected. The case of Sarath Fonseka is a good example. Before him, Brigadier Sarath Munasinghe, who was once military spokesman, failed to get elected, at the 2001 general election. Such reversals, while not doing the individual any good, is also bound to reflect negatively on the army.
Not just direct politics, the practice of making political appointments from among retired military personnel, too, should be limited, or, stopped altogether.
The practice today is to post former military officers, as Ambassadors, or, envoys abroad. This could be viewed as reward for having supported a particular political party, or, worse, committed unlawful acts, at the behest of political leaders. Under CBK, a retired police chief was made chairman of a state bank. Worse, under Rajapaksa, a retired Chief Justice was made a presidential advisor, while, another was sent as Ambassador to the Court of St.James. This, while smacking of impropriety, is, also unfair on the tax payer, who is being called upon to foot the bill of these pensioners, even after retirement.

Battle of coexistence
Apropos Rev. Fr. Augustine Fernandos opinion on Daily News of November 28 on Political resources for reconciliation, he reports of a recent gathering in Colombo of The District Inter-Religious Committees of Sri Lanka where there has been sharing of the experiences in all parts of the country.
I admire the unrelenting effort and enthusiasm of Rev. Fr. Augustine Fernando in his attempt to re-establish the harmonious living that existed in the good old days. He also expresses disappointment in the results of actions by the Minister and the National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Ministry to unite all people living in the island under the Sri Lankan identity due to attitude problems and, of political division existing in the country. No amount of high powered Committees consisting of different ethnicities or religions will succeed unless ALL of the people are made partners in the reconciliation process.
It is most unlikely that we will ever be without political divisions, but in spite of such, we should develop strategies to forge ahead with the much desired reconciliatory effort. For this, the entire population should be partners in the reconciliatory process. Reverend Father concludes, It has fallen to the present generation living in the North and South, East and West of Sri Lanka to usher a new political culture and redeem her good name as befitting those who live in the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. To achieve this end, I, a voice from the wilderness, would like to suggest a restructuring of our National Holidays, whereby there would be the opportunity for EVERYONE to respect each others religions and cultures.
I humbly present my recipe, which is likely to help achieve the cherished goal and in addition boost our economy as well.
We Sri Lankans enjoy too many holidays. In fact, we have the largest number of holidays when compared with the rest of the world. This affects adversely the smooth and efficient functioning of statecraft and economy of the country. Successive governments have made attempts to rectify this situation, without success.
Genuine unity and reconciliation
The declared Public Holidays amount to 25. Since we have a five-day working week, we will be holidaying for almost another five weeks, in addition to all the Saturdays and Sundays. Can we, a developing nation, afford such a large number of holidays, together with the holiday mood (preparation for the holiday and its aftermath) that spreads beyond the actual holiday, further eroding into the working hours and days
Further, can the declaration of a National Holiday, in commemoration of an event, where the majority of the people will do nothing connected with the event, be justified
A closer look at the list of public holidays shows that 23 out of the 25 have ethnoreligious commemorative significance, affording an ideal opportunity, only if used appropriately, to promote cross-faith interactions. There are only two days that are common to all sections of the society, i.e. Independence Day and the May Day. These two days and another eight days which are considered to be of the highest importance to the respective ethnic or religious group, namely Thai Pongal, Sinhala and Tamil New Year (two days), Vesak (two days), Poson, Ramazan and Christmas  a group of 10 need to be considered separately. During these 10 days, there are large-scale religious observances, social events and/or family reunions. This group of 10 could constitute our Commemorative Holidays.
Different religions and cultures
The remaining 15 commemorative events consisting of ten Poyas, Hadji, Prophet Mohammeds birthday, Mahasivarathri, Deepavali and Good Friday could be made full working days, with the exception that the first two hours i.e. 8 to 10 be spent in an activity devoted to the significance of that particular days event.
For example, on a Poya Day there could be a Bana preaching/meditation session; on Hadji and Prophet Mohammeds birthday, a programme on some aspect of Islam and the life of the Holy Prophet; on Deepavali and Maha Sivarathri Day a Hindu religious/cultural programme, and on Good Friday a Prayer Service, talk and discussion on the life of Jesus Christ. This will ensure that everyone will at least spend some time meaningfully, in observance of the particular event commemorated.
It will also promote understanding of the different religions and cultures, and integration and harmony amongst the different religious and ethnic groups, as all separate groups will together be involved in making arrangements and participating in each others function, and getting back to work after partaking in fellowship and refreshments.
One should not forget the fact that comparatively a small number of Buddhists observe Ata Sil on most of the Poya days. As Ata-Sil observance need not necessarily be on the Poya day, arrangements could be made to hold such observances on the Sunday following or preceding the Poya. In fact, most schools arrange their Ata-Sil observances on the school day preceding the Poya.
Since over the years we have been used to the idea of enjoying long weekends, consideration could be given to declaring one Monday or Friday in each quarter of the year, simply as an additional holiday, to encourage people to take a longer break and engage in an activity of their choice, which is a healthy concept. This would make a total of 14 National Holidays.
Thus it will be seen that this proposed scheme, will curtail the number of holidays and increase the number of working days, thereby helping the countrys smooth administration and economy; with a little give and take, it will also promote better understanding and appreciation of each others cultures, build bridges, facilitate cross-faith interactions and regain inter-community trust which is essential for ensuring harmony and oneness - particularly important in the coming days of a rejuvenated effort at nation rebuilding.

Calling  all word  players
As the excitement builds for the nineth year of the 2018 Fairway Galle Literary Festival from January 24 to 28, Juliet Coombe learns in the second announcement of authors just how rich and exciting this years event is going to be.
There is already a fantastic buzz in the air from the incredible line up of great writers and personalities coming to the 2018 Fairway Galle Literary Festival, including adventurous writers like Louis De Berniers and world famous actresses Dame Maggie Smith who will be talking about comedy, Sri Lankan fiction writer Ashok Ferry with The Ceaseless Chatter of Demons and wonderful memoirs to listen to and talk about. At this years festival you will be entertained by eminent lawyers like Lord De Silva, journalists on a mission, exceptional editors, performance poets, curators, architects, historians and economists.
Prolific fictional writing
The incredibly exciting line up, full of ideas and unique experiences to discuss and learn from is what makes this a must go to five-day festival that is the ultimate word on The Word. Find out for example about: project Austenistan, the parallels between Jane Austen and Pakistani society from Laaleen Sukhera, a Pakistani journalist; the end of the jury system in India with Bachi Karkaria, an Indian-Parsi journalist and former Editor of the Times of India; mystical Islamic writings with Bruce Wannell; or the streets of Calcutta from Kaushanava Choudhury, an Indian American reporter and writer. Also find out what it is like to be nudged by Kiryl Rudy, economically speaking; talk to Rachel who knows some of her brother the Uks Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnsons oldest secrets and a bit about hell; rest a little while listening to the piano duet of Ivana Alkovic and Maarten den Hengst or maybe dance to the celebrated contemporary Bangladeshi band, Chirkutt.
Be challenged to man up by Carlos Andrs Goms or even gaze out across the ocean thinking to yourself, water, water everywhere, nor any drop to drink, then go and see Malcolm Guite; learn about Coco Chanel from Justine Picardie; be horrified about the terrible legacy after the partitioning of India, written about by Nisid Hajari; learn from former Sri Lankan High Commissioner, Nirupama Menon Rao, about the relationship between the two most populous countries on earth; test your hearing skills on three murder trials with Justice Shiranee Tilakawardane; explore the redemptive possibilities of previously oppressive spaces with Calvyn Gilfellan; find out what Kafkaesque really means with Michael Kumpfmller and his paradoxical sounding new book about Kafkas final year, the Glory of Life and the ordinariness of true beauty; ponder about the seemingly impossible literature without words with Udeni Samarasekara; draw the line of Lanka with Sunela Jayewardene; or speak a few words with Laurence Boissier.
The richness of this festival is summed up by DBC Pierre: Watching the Indian Ocean from Galle, its easy to feel a 2,000 year-old silk route tying East to West underfoot. Now the Fairway Galle Literary Festival ties them again - and its silk is rich ideas.
If you want to learn about prolific fictional writing in diverse fields and his latest blockbusting detective series, see Alexander McCall Smith, Emeritus Professor of Medical Ethics at the University of Edinburgh. He writes some 2,000 to 3,000 words per day and some of his books have been translated into 46 languages. Who knows if you turn up to his talks, he might just use you as a character for his next book.
An immersive cultural experience
Children and adults alike will love to meet Francesca Simon, who has done the impossible by making history accessible and funny to very young people and parents desperately trying to get them interested in such important lessons to be learned.
The curator of this years exciting festival, Jill Macdonald, asks the question, Can words really mean so many things An event that since 2007 has celebrated the astonishing power of the human spirit to persevere and be true to itself  the resilience of individuals whose lives bear testimony to the distinctive creative potential of humanity and added to it is a stunning art trail of exhibitions full of messages and photography that will make you think. For her a must see of this years Festival will include presentations by The Lord Puttnam, whose Chariots of Fire remains an unparalleled testimony to the power of the human spirit and a striking piece of cinematography and by Shrabani Basu, whose groundbreaking novel Victoria and Abdul has just been made into a major motion picture with Dame Judi Dench.
The Fairway Galle Literary Festivals Sri Lankan setting is aptly represented by a number of brilliant Sri Lankan writers and these include Charulatha Abeysekera, this years winner of the Gratiaen Award, Nayomi Munaweera, winner of a State Literary Award and Shankari Chandran, who has been short listed for the Fairway National Literary Awards (FNLA). The winners of the FNLA Awards, which recognize literary achievement and excellence in Sinhala, Tamil and English, will be announced at an event that is an important fixture of the Festival.
Fairway Galle Literary Festival for all ages
In whatever language, the questioning of preconceptions is a crucial part of this festivals spirit - political correctness has established such a stranglehold on freedom of thinking - let alone speech - this kind of questioning has become rarer and therefore, like all rare things, more valuable. So bring your note books and an open mind and be part of a page turning event in the UNESCO World heritage site of Galle Fort, where many pages have been penned about its beauty and mystery as Asias largest living sea port, where the heart of the festival takes place in a myriad of historical landmark locations, boutique hotels and private properties, along with many other locations along the southern coast of Sri Lanka, making this festival truly an immersive cultural experience that celebrates literature, the arts and spirit of this wonderful island in the middle of the world.
A big thank you for the generous third year of sponsorship to the title sponsor Fairway Holdings. It is a company that is setting a great example of corporate leadership by promoting the Arts. The Tourist Board of Sri Lanka is the Official Destination Partner, Jetwing Hotels is the Official Hospitality Partner, Sri Lanka Telecom is the Official Telecom Partner and the DFCC Bank is the Official Banking Partner  many thanks to all of them for making such an important festival across all three languages possible.

China says Indian drone invaded its airspace
CHINA: An Indian drone has invaded Chinas airspace and crashed, Chinas defence ministry said Thursday, months after the neighbours ended one of their worst border standoffs in decades.
The Indian move violated Chinas territorial sovereignty. We strongly express our dissatisfaction and opposition, deputy director of the armys western theatre combat bureau, Zhang Shuili, said in a statement.
Zhang did not give details about when or where the incident happened.
Chinese border troops took a professional and responsible attitude and carried out identification verification of the device, Zhang said.
We will earnestly fulfil our mission of duty and firmly defend the sovereignty and security of our country, he added.
The Indian embassy in Beijing declined to comment.
In August, the two nations pulled back their troops to resolve a tense deadlock over part of a Himalayan plateau claimed by both China and Bhutan, an ally of India.
The standoff began in mid-June after Chinese troops started building a road on the remote Doklam plateau.
India has an army base nearby and moved soldiers into the flashpoint zone to halt the work, prompting Beijing to accuse it of trespassing on Chinese soil.
After both sides withdrew, Indias army chief said in September that his country could not afford to be complacent and must be prepared for war.
As far as our northern adversary is concerned, flexing of muscles has started, General Bipin Rawat said at a think tank event in New Delhi, in reference to China.
The salami slicing, taking over territory in a very gradual manner... testing our limits of threshold is something we have to be wary about and remain prepared for situations which could gradually emerge into conflict, the army chief said.
Rawat said India also has concerns that its arch rival Pakistan -- an ally of China -- could take advantage of the tensions.
India and China went to war in 1962 over the state of Arunachal Pradesh.
The latest episode has fed into a broader competition for regional influence between the two Asian powers.
The two emerging economies both have large populations and a growing middle class.
China has invited India to join President Xi Jinpings new Silk Road project to revive ancient trade routes from Asia to Europe and Africa.
But the proposed economic corridor has alarmed India, partly because one of the links cut through Pakistan-administered Kashmir, disputed territory that New Delhi claims is illegally occupied. - AFP

Fire crackers
Fire crackers are paper made money changed into fire. The practice prevails all over the world, to exhibit thrill on festivals and celebrations. The more the sound, the more response and welcome it receives. A spontaneous pleasure, and instantly, all over.
On a fireworks display in open spaces, it makes people happy. They like to see features to stay, to see it instantly disappear like a dream, pity! In other words, their hopes end like a dream come untrue.
This practice is a continuity, of a grand old practice. Money is burnt, billions of money is wasted for nothing but for explosion with a loud noise.
Those who refrain from this practice, save vast amounts of money. For them, calm peaceful celebrations on festivals take place.
So, lets shift from this fire cracking tradition, save and spend for beneficial and gainful purposes thereby, help ourselves and the nation. It is a risk taking experience to crack fire. Why play with fire.
The state media and the private sector media should counsel people to keep away from this age old practice, and save billions worth of money. This old habit should be discouraged. Billions going to the hands and coffers of just a few manufacturers and companies could be turned around to common, public interest welfare. This should be encouraged.

The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) has launched an operation in cracking down on factories that manufacture various types of prohibited polythene countrywide.
CEA Chairman Prof. Lal Mervin Dharmasiri told Daily News in Kurunegala recently that investigation officers of the CEA have been deployed for this by now and after conducting raids of such errant factories, further steps would be taken to nab those who sell such illegal polythene that has posed a grave environmental threat to human life by now.
He said that those who are found guilty of this national crime will have to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000 or they have to undergo a jail term of two years or both sentences according to the newly introduced rules and regulations.
Kurunegala senior Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake confirmed these views and said today (07) in Kurunegala that about 43 officials have been deployed to nab errant polythene manufacturers and sellers in both Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the North Western Province.

Real MadridforwardCristiano Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or award as soccer's best player of the year for a record-equaling fifth time, moving him level with Barcelona star Lionel Messi.
Ronaldo won the trophy awarded by France Football magazine at a ceremony held at the Eiffel Tower on Thursday.
He finished ahead of contenders Messi and Neymar, who left Barcelona in the offseason to joinParis Saint-Germainfor a world record transfer fee of 222 million Euros ($262 million).
Ronaldo was shown on television receiving the award while making the sign of five with his left hand as held the trophy in his right. Messi was runner-up behind him and Neymar was third.
"Of course, I feel happy, it's a big moment in my career," Ronaldo said. "It's something I hope to win every year."
The 32-year-old Portugal forward also took home the Ballon d'Or prize in 2013 and 2014, and in 2008 when playing for Manchester United.
Messi won it from 2009-12 and again in 2015.
Ronaldo claimed it back last year after helping Portugal win the European Championship and starring for Madrid as it won the Champions League.
Last season he won the Champions League once again and played a key role as Madrid won the Spanish league title for the first time since 2012.
"If he can score 10 times in training he will, that's what impresses me," Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said. "His ambition impresses me. I'm proud to be his coach."
Ronaldo is the all-time leading scorer in the history of the Champions League with 115 goals.
He set another competition record on Wednesday, scoring in Real Madrid's 3-2 win over Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday to become the first player to find the net in all six group-stage matches.
It took his tally to nine so far, but in La Liga it has been a very different story during this campaign.
In August, he was banned for five games after shoving referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea in the back following his red card during a 3-1 victory over Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup. He missed the return leg of the Spanish Super Cup in Madrid plus the first four matches of the Spanish league season.
Since then, he has managed only a meager two in 10 games and Madrid is fourth- already eight points behind leader Barcelona after 14 matches.
Veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon was fourth on France Football's list. The 39-year-old Italian helped Juventus reach the Champions League final and win the Italian title for the sixth straight season.
Croatia midfielder Luka Modric and Spain defender Sergio Ramos- both Ronaldo's teammates- were fifth and sixth respectively.
Teenage star Kylian Mbappe finished seventh after helping Monaco win the French title and reach the Champions League semifinals. He joined Neymar at PSG this season in a deal worth 180 million Euros ($216 million) _ the second-most expensive ever.
Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante, Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski and Tottenham striker Harry Kane completed the top 10.
PSG striker Edinson Cavani was surprisingly 11th despite scoring a career-high 49 goals in all competitions last term.

Electric car plant, lithium battery factory in Lanka soon - Dr Yaddehige
Richard Pieris & Company PLC plans to invest between Rs 15 to 20 billion in several unique projects in the next three years that will see electric cars, lithium batteries and Oud perfume manufactured in Sri Lanka.
Dr. Sena Yaddehige, Chairman of Richard Pieris & Company PLC, said the group profit that stood at Rs 180 million in 2002, today, before even finishing the year has increased to Rs 4,100 million, a 28 times increase. He further said the business that commenced manufacturing rubber erasers has developed to such a extent that there was not a single house that had no Arpico product in Sri Lanka today.
Dr. Yaddehige owns 10 patents has over 20 million cars all over the world running with his chips.
The Chairman said he would embark on enormous important projects and one of them is building a lithium battery factory. This was required to complement his other major project which is to build electric cars in Sri Lanka.
For this, an 80 acre plot of land has already been purchased for Rs 730 million, he said addressing a gathering in Colombo on Wednesday. Dr Yaddehige said he plans to introduce the four-door electric car for a very competitive price of Rs 1.5 million.
He said his next project is to manufacture the worlds most expensive Oud perfume in Sri Lanka which is made from the resin of the wallapatta tree. He said they would convert 68% of their plantation to grow wallapatta. The wood of a 9 to 10 year wallapatta tree has a value of Rs 225,000. If 400,000 such trees are grown, the value of those trees would be in excess of Rs 100 billion in 8 to 10 years time, he said. But the trick is we have to inoculate a certain fungus into it and we are working on it.
Richard Pieris & Company has another project involving tea, to extract its flavour and essence and market it as green tea. Last year it was launched in Las Vegas, he said. An extract of the plant will be set up in Maskeliya for this purpose.
Dr Yaddehige said they have also decided to replace the soil of their plantations and a team of five top scientists of the country was on the job. He said they plan to take 180 tons of special kind of enriched and enhanced compost every three months to the plantations to enhance the quality of soil in the plantations.
He said they plan to set up an electronic division with a target of Rs 25 billion turnover in the next five years and a retail sector with a target of Rs 40 billion turnover in the next five years.
The asset base of their finance company has grown to Rs 11 billion with Rs 4 billion in deposits within five years. The Groups plantation sector is expected to record a Rs 1.5 billion turnover.
He said they own the fastest growing life insurance company with a hundred percent growth. The Group employs 32,000 and in addition provides indirect employment to a further 200,000.
The 25th Arpico Supercentre has been also opened at Talawatugada and the three storeyed, 60,000 sqft biggest Supercentre will be opened in Kegalle in February and the Kandy Supercentre is being expanded at the moment with the addition of another 25,000 sqft and will be opened by the end of this month. Arpico Supercentres will also be opened in Katugastota, Kundasale, Moratuwa and Wattala.

England have left scars on Australia - Bayliss
ADELAIDE: England coach Trevor Bayliss says his team left a few scars on Australia in the Adelaide Test, suggesting the home sides second innings batting performance will have some players feeling nervous.
The fighting talk came after England slumped to a crushing 120-run defeat in the second Ashes Test at Adelaide, leaving the tourists trailing 2-0 and on the verge of losing the five-Test series.
Despite succumbing again, Bayliss was upbeat about his bowlers skittling Australia for 138 in the second innings, leaving England with a chance of chasing down a record 354-run victory target.
We have got a few scars there with the Australian team, he told the BBC.
There will be a few who have missed out and a few who will be nervous.
Theyve got four good bowlers and weve shown we can compete with them for a period of time. Weve just got to do it for longer. Captain Joe Root was also positive after the game, saying England were still massively in the Ashes series.
This is despite England not beating Australia at Perths WACA Ground since 1978, where the third Test starts next week.
Weve shown throughout the two Tests in periods we can out-perform Australia, but just not over five days, said Root, who scored 67 in the second innings run chase but failed to stay at the crease long enough to give his side a realistic shot at winning.
If we can perform to our ability for longer periods of time well win games. The belief in dressing room is definitely there. Bayliss said the team played well in final days of the Adelaide day-night Test, but they needed to make more than 220 runs in an innings to stand a chance in Perth.
If we do that well we can put more pressure on Australia than we did on this match, he said.
Australia head into the third Test with allrounder Mitch Marsh recalled to the squad, with the home side conscious of protecting star fast bowlers Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins with the series still alive and three Tests remaining.
Marsh, brother of Adelaide Test centurion Shaun Marsh, last played a Test on Australias tour of India in March and required a full shoulder reconstruction after an injury in the Bangalore Test.
But he is confident he can contribute if selected, with middle-order batsman Peter Handscomb likely to be dropped if Australia opt for Marsh.
As an allrounder in the Australian team with our attack Im obviously not going to be bowling 30 to 40 overs a game, he said.
But Ive worked hard over the last eight months to get my body into a position where Im now playing again as an allrounder so thats really exciting.

Food is thy medicine
In one of my Notebooks, this one devoted to the medicinal value of herbs, I have noted the counsel of Hippocrates who lived in the Island of Cos, Greece, in 460 BC  Let thy food be thy medicine".
Recently, a friend from the days we were in the boarding at the school on Darley Road and later read Greats at Peradeniya, gave me a call to confirm that he has found a paper cutting of one of my articles written decades ago on medicinal herbs, in an old escritoire (pettagama) and re-reading it. Very adept at the piano he had the ability to play masterpieces to the delight of his friends. He recently discovered that his left hand is afflicted with a touch of Parkinson, due to the gradual depletion of dopamine in the brain.
The 20 amino acids involved in protein biosynthesis are divided into two broad groups, essential and non-essential. For good health 8 of these amino acids are essential and must be taken either in the form of pill or capsule, in addition to the minuscule amounts found in the food we eat. The remaining 12 non-essential amino acids, the body can synthesize from the diet. For example, Betamine is a non-essential amino acid. It is found in beetroot. When the tuber is included in the diet the body uses the Betamine in it for the production of Dopamine. People suffering from Parkinson and those who are not, are advised to include beetroot frequently in the diet.
Medicinal herbs
Remember western medicine has no cure for the involuntary tremors in the fingers, the hallmark of Parkinson because the disease is unique. What is good for one unfortunate patient may not be good for the other. To form an Association to discuss each ones experiences is, therefore, a dead end and appropriate for singing nothing more than a few off-key songs. Western medicine goes on voyages of discovery and experiment with different drugs, treatments and therapies to find what is best for each patient by which time the patient is penniless and worse knocking at the doors of Kanatte.
When you exploit the bounty of Nature found in medicinal herbs (a) You escape the monstrous side effects of conventional drugs (b) You can laugh all the way to the bank by short-circuiting the charges like hospital fees, consultation fees that burn holes in your pocket. (c) Avoid the burden of waiting in a crowded waiting room filled with obnoxious gases and elements not even a chemist will find in Mendeleev's Periodic Table.
Take the plight of a patient suffering from Parkinson and white coat syndrome. If the appointment is at 7 pm, the mere waiting from 7 pm until he is called say at 9 pm is likely to send his blood pressure through the roof. A cynic may ask why not avoid the fees by visiting a Free State hospital. If you do you will find only the benches because the white coats are catching straws, dancing on Main Street.
Carl Sagan the celebrated American Astronomer whose name is somewhere in a plaque on the moon, whilst lying in the Sloan Kettering Institute dying of terminal prostate cancer, praised the Institute for its enlightened policy of allowing patients to adjust the pain-killing morphine drip.
The misbehaviour of the prostate gland and the eyes due to cataract and glaucoma can be avoided by taking say 50 mg of Zinc since the prostate and the eye depends on Zinc for good behaviour. Whole grain products like chickpeas, green gram are good sources of Zinc.
The simple herb Neeramuliya is ideal for treating prostate problems. If a male nearing the Biblical age of three scores and ten finds some tightening whilst urinating take a handful of Neeramuliya in 8 cups of water boil and reduce to one cup, strain and drink, twice a day until the tightness disappears. Avoid the dried herb found in most outlets. The fresh herb is available in wayside markets.
Exploit hidden secrets
Another example is the medicinal herb Athavariya for joint pains due to arthritis, as an alternative to the highly toxic, anti-inflammatory drugs or surgery. It is a creeper which I used decades ago when I was careless with my food. Prepare the way like Neeramulliya and use with an essential oil applied externally on the joints. I sadly see patients waddling about with an awkward gait after knee surgery. Another useful tip is the simple habit of wearing a copper bangle. Studies show copper levels in the blood of those suffering from joint pains are low. Although I am not suffering from joint pains, for the sake of protection, I use one.
Phlegm is the brutal enemy of the lungs. Thibbatu safely handles the problem. It is a super expectorant. Nurture a plant. It will provide all you need and more. A bare hand full from a street market will stun with its cost.
Why the state does not establish modest facilities in the provinces each to run by an RMP or a trained nurse to exploit the hidden secrets in medicinal plants and for things ancient like acupuncture rattles the mind.
Their secrets help the underclass to lead useful lives without being a burden on others. In our mad rush to build edifices, we are forgetting the blind, the lame and the halt. After imbibing in western thought we seem to lose our roots. A good example is Arthur Dias, a patriarch of the family from Panadura. He tirelessly campaigned for the planting of Jak trees and ridiculed for his efforts with the nickname kos mama by the western educated gentry.

Freshwater Fisher Information System established
The first-ever Freshwater Fisher Information System - Infish for Sri Lanka and Asia was officially established on Wednesday. The National Aquaculture Development Authority (NAQDA) began operations.
According to the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry sources, the main objective of establishing this system is to uplift the living standards of the freshwater fisher community.
All information related to the freshwater fisheries industry in Sri Lanka including the number of freshwater fishermen, their daily fish harvest and income, and savings will be included in this system.
The system was ceremonially opened by Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
Currently, around 10,000 inland reservoirs are available in the country and around 45 inland reservoirs will be regulated under the first phase of the project. The NAQDA plans to include all other reservoirs into the system by the end of 2018.
He said the government is planning to develop the inland fisheries industry as it remains unaffected by the issues the saltwater fisheries industry is currently confronting.
A special app has been created for this purpose and a tablet computer and other equipment valued at Rs. 195,000 will also be provided to each freshwater fishermens unions. The government has allocated Rs. 8 million for this project.
NAQDA Chairman Upali Mohotti and Director General Nimal Chandraratne also participated.

Good governance in practical terms
On January 8, 2015 people voted for change. The quintessence of their aspiration was expressed in a single term - yahapalanaya or good governance. Now almost three years later, people still wonder whether yahapalanaya is in place or not.
It is not that they do not acknowledge the few positive developments such as the reduction of the powers of the executive presidency, the appointment of some independent commissions, the abolition of the fear psychosis and the disappearance of the ubiquitous White Van, a symbol of State terror, relative independence of the judiciary albeit with its perceived and from recent times emphatic class bias in favour of the rich and the mighty.
What the popular reaction indicates is their discontent with the progress of yahapalanaya or its pace of development. However objective one tries to be, it is still impossible for a political columnist not to leave a streak of subjectivity in his assessment. Hence, we would today refrain from comment and only reproduce below certain observations of the Auditor-General in his Report for the Year 2016, a period falling entirely within the ambit of the Yahapalana Government.
With a view to promoting tourism, the T1 515 Rail Car of the Department with a capacity of facilitating 32 passengers had been given on lease to a limited company in order to providing luxury services to foreign tourists. As the said company had not taken action in compliance with the agreement, the Department had spent a sum of Rs.2.32 million for the improvement and renovation of the Rail Car by the end of the year 2015. Nevertheless, that expenses had not been recovered.
In order to maintain an office in the name of Rail Tours at the Port Railway Station for the dissemination of information relating to tourism, building space facilities of 565 square feet had been made available to a limited company from the year 1987. The lease rent that remained receivable as at August 30, 2011 had been Rs.1.32 million. Without taking action to recover the above lease rent in arrears, it had been leased out to the same company again under a new agreement for a period of five years from September 01, 2011 to August 31, 2016 on a monthly rental of Rs.40,000 determined at the discretion of the General Manager of Railways.
Laws, rules and regulations
Yet nothing has been done to recover the losses or those responsible were not brought to book.
Again, reporting on the Coal Procurements made by the Lanka Coal Company (Pvt) Limited during the period from the year 2009 to June 2016 for the Lakvijaya Power Plant at Norochchole of the Ceylon Electricity Board The overall situation is that Ministry Power and Renewable Energy, the Lanka Coal Company (Pvt) Limited, the Ceylon Electricity Board, Ceylon Shipping Corporation, the Technical Evaluation Committee and the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee had not exercised professional due care in the performance of their duties, that is, failed to follow laws, rules, regulations and best practices in the procurement process thus resulting in an estimated loss/ additional cost/loss of income amounting to Rs.4,145.43 million.
Once more no follow-up action has been taken.
In another instance, out of 257,559 metric tons of rice costing Rs.15,996 million had been imported in the years 2014 and 2015 from India and Bangladesh by Lanka Sathosa (Ltd.) only 75,002 metric tons had been imported with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers and 152,255 metric tons of rice valued at Rs.9,735 million had been imported on the concurrence of the General Treasury without the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers. Moreover, the approval of the Board of Directors had not been obtained for the stocks of 30,302 metric tons of rice valued at Rs.1,914 million imported directly by the Lanka Sathosa and purchases had been made on the instructions of the Chairman.
Again, the same situation with no action taken.
In year 2016 provision of Rs.121 billion had been made under the Object 126-2-4-1-1407 Cost of Maintenance of the Public Investments (Lands and Buildings) of the Ministry of Education. However, no expenditure whatsoever had been incurred from that provision in the year 2016 that represented 88 per cent of the total.
Yet the authorities talk of record expenses for school maintenance at public meetings to dupe the public.
Instead of the promises to relieve the poor of the tax burden by changing the ratio of direct to indirect taxes (such as custom duties, BTT, VAT etc.) from 80:20 to 60:40, in the year 2016 the ratio has gone further up reaching 82.31:17.69 per cent. Katawa dolawen, gamana payin. (Boasts of luxurious travelling while walking barefoot.)
Department of Excise has total arrears of revenue inclusive of the penalties amounting to Rs.2,545 million. Out of that  57 per cent represented arrears existing over periods exceeding 5 years.
Lethargy, inefficiency and indifference
The contract relating to the printing of the number plates of the motor vehicles registered in the Department had been awarded to a private contractor Company for the period May 01, 2010 to April 30, 2015. Even though quotations should have been invited and a contractor for the period after April 30, 2015 should have been selected, the contract period had been extended at the old price from time to time from May 01, 2015 to October 31, 2017.
These examples were taken at random. Yet it throws light on the bigger picture. Nothing has changed. It is the status quo ante that prevails. This shows not only the lethargy, inefficiency and indifference of the public servants but also the camaraderie of laws, rules, regulations with the errant officialdom. Something more than platform preaching and warnings is required.
Problems are known.
Malaise is identified. Yet, no one is interested in a cure. For example, those in authority know that much of the food in the market, including agricultural products are unhealthy due to the use of various toxic substances in their preparation. Even the highest in the land acknowledges it. Yet nothing is done about it. They wish to let people suffer slow death, instead of punishing the culprits. They could at least ensue that more frequent raids are conducted and stricter rules be observed. At least the enthusiasm in taking people to court on account of breeding mosquitos is not replicated in this instance. There is an acute shortage of Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) and some local bodies have only one or two. At a time when elected representatives have begun to multiply like amoeba, it would not be out of tune to increase the number of PHIs.

IMF approves USD 251.4 million to Sri Lanka

International Monetary Fund (IMF) Executive Board completed the third review of Sri Lankas Extended Fund Facility arrangement, which enables the disbursement of about USD 251.4 million.
While the authorities met fiscal targets and legislated the income tax reform, further consolidation is necessary, given Sri Lankas high debt burden and large gross financing needs.
Further build-up of international reserves under greater exchange rate flexibility will help reduce Sri Lankas external vulnerability.
The Executive Board of the IMF completed the third review of Sri Lankas economic performance under the program supported by a three-year extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement last Wednesday.
Completion of the review enables the disbursement of the equivalent of SDR 177.774 million (about USD 251.4 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to the equivalent of SDR 537.456 million (about USD 759.9 million).
Sri Lankas three-year extended arrangement was approved on June 3, 2016, in the amount of about SDR 1.1 billion (USD1.45 billion, or 185 percent of quota in the IMF at that time of approval of the arrangement. The governments reform program, supported by the IMF, aims to reduce the fiscal deficit, rebuild foreign exchange reserves, and introduce a simpler, more equitable tax system to restore macroeconomic stability and promote inclusive growth.
Following the Executive Boards discussion of the review, Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Acting Chair and Deputy Managing Director, said:
Sri Lankas performance under the Fund-supported program has remained broadly on track since the second review. Macroeconomic and financial conditions have been stable, despite a series of weather-related supply shocks. The authorities remain committed to the economic reforms under the program and have undertaken measures to improve government revenue and accumulate international reserves. Going forward, it is important to build on the progress made and accelerate reforms to further reduce fiscal and external vulnerabilities.
Fiscal performance has been satisfactory and all targets until September were met. The new Inland Revenue Act will make the tax system more efficient and equitable, and generate resources for social and development programs. Nevertheless, Sri Lankas high debt burden, large gross financing needs, and weak financial performance of state-owned enterprises increases the importance of further fiscal consolidation. Timely progress in structural reforms, including tax administration and energy pricing, will support fiscal consolidation.
Inflation and credit growth remain on the high side. Maintaining a tightening bias for monetary policy is recommended until clear signs emerge that inflation pressures and credit expansion have subsided. Macro prudential tools should also be used to help rein in credit growth and head off systemic risks. While financial soundness indicators remain stable, financial sector supervision and the AML/CFT regime should be further strengthened.
Along with efforts to deepen the foreign exchange market, it is important to further accumulate reserves and enhance exchange rate flexibility to reduce Sri Lankas external vulnerability.
Structural reforms are also needed to enhance competitiveness and promote inclusive growth, including measures to improve trade and investment regimes.

An innovation in fish  smoking improves lives
The traditional method of fish smoking in Unnichchai, a small fishing community in the Batticaloa district sees women spending many hours tending to fish laid out on mesh over smoking coals.
Health hazards from smoke inhalation are high, while the output from such intensive labour is often low. That is now changing with the introduction of new smoking ovens pioneered by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) under a programme funded by the European Union (EU).
The first thing I noticed was that the new technology helps me save time, said Kopalapillai Theivarmallar who makes her living from fish-smoking to provide for her three daughters. Before, I spent a total of 12 hours on two consecutive days drying and smoking the fish, and I used the old method of iron mesh. Now, 6 to 7 hours are enough to finish one smoking. It gives me plenty of time to take care of my children and do household chores, she said.
Since 2008 FAO has worked on developing the FTT-Thiaroye, an improved fish smoking and drying oven technology. The oven can be purpose built, or the smoke-capturing chimney, oil-catching trays and other elements can be added to an existing oven. It is designed to improve fuel-efficiency in fish-smoking by encapsulating heat and smoke. It also addresses health hazards suffered by small-scale fish dryers  the vast majority of whom are women.
In the Batticaloa district, around 150 families are engaged in fish-smoking activities. The traditional smoking method is done in the open, making the fish prone to spoilage from rain and external contamination. Strong winds can lengthen the process and often results in lesser-quality fish that sell at lower prices.
With the method of iron mesh, our smoked fish is of poor quality, they are sold at 600 to 750 rupees per kilo. This is a very low price. The money we earn is not even enough to send our children to school, said Fransis Devamalar, a fish smoker who heads her family of four children.
The FAO technology was first introduced in Africa, where 12 countries have now adopted it. Women using old methods of fish-smoking over an open fire often suffer eye and skin irritations and respiratory disease from the smoke. However, African women who have adopted the new method have improved their health, significantly increased their income, reduced their costs, cut down on losses, improved the quality and safety of their smoked fish, and were able to improve their familys food security and nutrition.
In June this year, FAO with the European Union Support to District Development Programme (EU-SDDP) introduced the new smoking technology to Asia for the first time, starting with Sri Lanka where fish is a major source of livelihoods and nutrition.
Introducing the new ovens will help to make the fish value chain in Sri Lanka more productive and profitable for the poorest families, said FAOs Representative in Sri Lanka Nina Brandstrup. We are planning to support the introduction of the new technology in other parts of the country, she said. This requires guidelines to be prepared in local languages and disseminated, and extension workers trained to advise communities on the construction and use of the ovens.
Constructing the first oven with a shed for processing space in Unnichchai cost around Rs. 227,000  relatively expensive for small-scale fishing communities. However, the oven is shared among many families and expanding it to other communities will likely rely on micro-finance support from the government, development institutions, NGOs or the private sector.
For Kopalapillai Theivamalar, she is already seeing the benefits. Before, I could only process 16 to 40 kilos of fish per day, but with the new ovens I can smoke 100 kilos per day. Also, the firewood needed is cheaper. Theivamalar is now able to sell the smoked fish at 1100 rupees per kilo due to the improved product quality.
An additional eight ovens are in the process of being constructed under the EU-SDDP project in Sri Lanka. This is a good entry point to the Asian continent which produces close to half the worlds smoked fish, explained Yvette Diei Ouadi, the FAO Fishery Officer who coordinates the programme.
The FTT pilot unit established in June 2017 in Batticaloa has demonstrated the potential for improving product quality, reducing post-harvest losses, and environmental issues. FAO Sri Lanka jointly with the Government of Sri Lanka foresees a wider scale initiative that mainstreams the FTT for improved livelihood and food security.
Jointly implemented by five agencies of the United Nations namely FAO, UNDP, UNICEF, UNOPS, and ILO, and IFC from the World Bank Group, the EU-SDDP is a European Union-funded development cooperation programme with a total financial grant support of EUR 60 million. Its objective is to contribute to poverty reduction and livelihood development in seven districts in the North and East to bridge the socio-economic gap with the rest of the country. The programme supports the conflict-affected districts of Batticaloa, Mannar, Vavuniya, Ampara, Monaragala, Anuradhapura and Puttalam impacting half a million people.

Judge orders police to speed up Dehiwala orphanage abuse case
The Gangodawila Magistrate ordered the Boralesgamuwa Police to expedite the investigation into the alleged sexual harassment and abuse of 18 young women at an orphanage in Dehiwala.
The order comes as lawyers representing the women and victims advocates accuse the police of dragging their feet on the case.
Officers initially arrested Mohamed Sarippuge Mohar, 62, who they say was a driver for the orphanage, on charges of sexual harassment in July. According to the victims statements, he touched them inappropriately in the vehicle he drove them in, as well as in the orphanage, where he also lived.
Police filed separate charges after one of the girls testimony revealed that she potentially suffered grave sexual abuse from Mohar.
National Child Protection Authority Chairperson Marini de Livera said that her officers, as well as local police, have met resistance from the organisation in their investigation.
Activists gathered outside the Gangodawila Magistrates Court yesterday, holding signs in Sinhala, English, and Tamil urging authorities to increase their oversight of the case.
Its been a long time this case has been going on, but still, the affected victims havent received any justice, said Maureen Ernest, an anti-domestic abuse activist. So the court should be able to proceed the case more quickly than they have.
The activists presented a written statement signed by over 40 civil society organizations, which said they were concerned that despite the occurrence of the alleged incident, the children have been returned to the orphanage which is still under the old management.
We request the National Child Protection Authority to take official control of the management of the Darun Nusra Orphanage until suitable alternative arrangements can be made in terms of appointing a new management, they wrote.
Dr. Mareena Reffai, the founder of the Almuslimaath foundation which runs the orphanage, denied that any harassment occurred, saying theres no medical evidence of sexual abuse.

Dr. Mareena Reffai, the founder of the Almuslimaath foundation which runs the orphanage, denied that any harassment occurred, saying theres no medical evidence of sexual abuse.
Former Almuslimaath President Shana Mohinudeen, however, accused Reffai in a July letter of knowing about the abuse and doing nothing about it. She quit her post in protest the same day.
Counsel for the young women on Thursday also produced documents in court alleging that the girls had reported the abuse both to the mans wife and Dr. Reffai, and that they did not take action.
Responding to the allegations in a recent written statement, Dr. Reffai said none of the children were raped. But she also distanced herself from Mohar, saying I never helped (him) in any way whatsoever after he was arrested.
Speaking after Mohars criminal hearing Thursday, lawyers for the young women said they were happy with the Magistrates order to fast-track the investigation. Justice delayed is justice denied, said Shiraz Noordeen, the lawyer who is representing the victims.
NCPA Chairperson de Livera said she had sent a team of investigators to the orphanage after the court hearing to further interview the victims.
The Magistrate said that the earliest the case could be called again is January 25.

Lightning railway strike: commuters stranded
Thousands of commuters were left stranded yesterday, following an unanounced strike by the Railway Locomotive Engine Drivers Union who are demanding a revision of the existing recruitment policies.
Commuters left in the lurch had to find alternate ways to reach their places of work.
A special meeting between Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry Secretary G.S Withanage and trade union representatives proved futile since they could not reach a consensus yesterday. The Unions wowed to continue their strike until their demands were met.
The Union launched the train strike at midnight on December 6 urging authorities to revise existing recruitment policies for assistant train drivers.
A case is to be filed at Magistrates Court to abolish this act which is used to recruit Assistant Engine Drivers at a higher salary scales, as it goes against the existing Railway recruitment procedure, the Ministry Secretary said.
He added that government employees should respect Court orders and added that he would take measures to solve their problems quickly.He requested the union members to consider the inconvenience caused to students sitting for the upcoming GCE Ordinary Examination and appealed to them to solve their issues through dialogue.
However,he said the Sri Lanka Transport Board and National Transport Commission have deployed additional buses to minimise any inconvenience caused to students and the public.
Train Station Masters and train Regulatory Officers too decided to join the strike from midnight yesterday (7) as the Cabinet Paper calling on an increase in salaries pertaining to their grades had not been approved, Station Masters Association Chairman Janaka Fernando said.
According to the Railway Main Control room, 150 daily journeys,including 50 office journeys were cancelled as a result of the strike.
They added that office hour trains from Matara, Galle, Chilaw and Rambukkana operated as usual despite the strike.
We had to cancel several train journeys with the current situation.I strongly believe that we can solve matters and recommence train services as normal soon, Sri Lanka Railways General Manager S.M.Abeywickrama told the Daily News.

Mini investment clubs  to attract French  funds to Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka is to launch mini investment clubs in France for the first time in a bid to promote investments to the island. Through these clubs, French investors can be offered investment projects that are available in Sri Lanka.
This novel concept is the brainchild of the newly appointed Sri Lanka Ambassador to France, Buddhi Athauda.
Speaking to Daily News Business, he stated that the change of the political culture in Sri Lanka has opened many opportunities for doing business with the Western world in the context where democracy, accountability and transparency have been strengthened which has led to improved social indicators. These are the reasons for the lifting of the fishing ban and restitution of the GSP+ by the EU.
Sri Lankas strategic geographical location has been of vital importance in conducting trade and investment from ancient times. Ambassador Athauda is of the view that this key factor for attracting foreign investors should be further consolidated in order to develop a competitive edge over the neighboring countries of the region.
He also highlighted that the proposed FTAs with a number of countries and the opportunities for development under the Western Megapolis and Port City projects are also steps taken in the right direction to boost investment and trade.
With the investment friendly climate and with Sri Lanka becoming a middle income country, I think the time is ripe for us to source multiple investments from Europe and the West. It was with this in mind that I decided to launch mini investment clubs in France for strategic sectors which are of high interest to Sri Lanka. At the same time the Sri Lankan diaspora is also being encouraged to invest in other regions of the country in addition to the North and East.
Ambassador Athauda who is a high-end and cutting edge technology startup expert, is keen on the idea of putting a total package on the table for possible investors. While he intends to promote investment through the mini investment clubs, he will work with the relevant stakeholders in Sri Lanka obtain the necessary approvals and documentation.
The Embassy will play the role of matchmaker and be a one stop shop for French investors to identify opportunities and to complete necessary regulatory steps as required by Sri Lankan authorities as it was my experience that many investors from Europe do not want to waste a lot of time on approvals.
The Embassy will also work with development banks to promote public private partnerships as well as opportunities for collaboration with the SME sector.
Ambassador Athauda identified shipping, transport, (light railways), megalopolis development, renewable energy, real estate, investment banking and leisure as the main sectors of interest for French investors.
Athauda holds a Masters Degree in International Finance from the USA where he has lived for many years. He was one of the pioneering leaders in the development of the worlds first satellite mobile phone Iridium from USA.

Monthly exports top US$ 1 bn 3 times this year
As Sri Lankas pro-growth reforms gather pace, amid an improving external economic environment, exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) have shown substantial increases this year compared to last year.
According to the latest data released by the Export Development Board, merchandise exports have grown by 10.3% during January to October 2017, compared to the same period last year.
Merchandise export earnings recorded US$ 9.5 billion for the eight months to October this year, compared to US$ 8.6 billion last year. Estimates in the services exports sector suggest an overall growth of 5.9% during the first eight months of the year, bringing total exports to US$ 12.5 billion.
Most notably, monthly export revenues breached US$ 1 billion on three occasions this year, a trend not seen in recent years. The EDB expects export earnings for the full year (Jan-Dec) to total US$ 15 billion.
Within merchandise exports, fisheries exports have grown by a substantial 42%, agricultural exports by 18.5%, and industrial exports by 5.9%. Strong performance is seen in several of the priority sectors identified under the new National Export Strategy; notably, electronics and electrical exports growing by 17.8%, spices growing by 34%, and boat building growing by over 370%.
By export destination, earnings from exports to the European Union have increased by 4.1%, and exports to USA have increased by 1.5% during January to October this year, compared to the same period last year. Exports to the ASEAN region have grown substantially, by 45%, to US$ 400 million (compared to US$ 276 mn last year). Exports to India have performed strongly, growing at 24%, from US$ 456 million to US$ 566 million during the period in review.
Meanwhile, exports to the UK have declined by 1.8%, largely on account of the depreciation of the GBP and the consumer market uncertainty due to Brexit.
Data from the Board of Investment indicates a substantial uptick in FDI inflows to the country of US$ 795.5 million during January to September this year; 80% higher than the same period last year and already exceeding the full year 2016. The BOI expects FDI for the full year 2017 to total US$ 1.36 billion.
The manufacturing and services sectors have seen the larger share of FDI inflows of US$ 397 mn, while the infrastructure and utilities sectors received US$ 352.5 mn. FDI from China (including Hong Kong) is around 35% of FDI to date, while India is 16.4%, and Singapore is 9.3%.
Others in the top 10 countries for FDI into Sri Lanka are Netherlands, United Kingdom, Japan, Malaysia, Sweden, and Australia.

If a popularity poll is held, not only in Sri Lanka but all over the cricket world to select the best ever off spin bowler in the history of the game, it will be a one horse race with Sri Lankas MUTTIAH MURALITHARAN winning that contest with no votes for a second best.
MURALITHARAN from the time he began to spin a ball at St. Anthonys College, Kandy in junior cricket showed magic even at that level. All former Antonian greats who watched him, juggle the ball like a magician, predicted that the sky was the limit for him. And MURALITHARAN did not disappoint.
When he graduated to the first team at SACK he had shed his fondness to bowl fast and his coach Sunil Fernando saw the potential in him as an off spin bowler and urged him to concentrate on off spin bowling.

In his new role he simply mesmerised all opposing school boy batsmen. They who did not have a clue and bags full of wickets came like an avalanche every season. MURALI proved that he was too good for school cricket as he toyed with batsmen.
He joined the Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club and began to prosper with his wizardry with the ball, leading the club to honours. It was not long before when the call came to serve his country.
His entry was not startling probably due to nerves which every cricketer suffers when playing in the big or the elite league. Once he got the feel of performing on the big stage, he shed his shyness and nerve. And with every outing he began to stun batsmen and the world of cricket.
Phenomenal rise
MURALITHARANS phenomenal rise, brought in its wake the green eyed who could not bear to watch this stunning phenomenon. They began to question his action that was magic hitherto unseen. He got the ball to talk as it were and opponents began to prepare wickets that would not respond to his unplayable variety of spin.
But whatever wicket, even if they had rolled out a concrete wicket, he had the rare ability to turn the ball prodigiously on any surface. It is said that he could make the ball spin even on ice. Such was his rare talent that made all other spinners in world cricket envy him.
His wickets that he captured came like the Mahaweli River in spate. He did not have much success with his off spinners. But once he learnt to bowl the doosra which is delivered with the off spin action but when it pitches goes the other way like a leg break. This mesmerising delivery was taught to him by Saqlain Mushtaq the Pakistani off spinning champion and once MURALITHARAN mastered it he used it like a nuclear missile to destroy opposing batsmen.
Mind boggling
Success in Test and one-day cricket is mind boggling and to enumerate his achievements would need reams and reams of newsprint and instead of going on to detail them, it is being reproduced below so that readers could amaze themselves on the web he spun as the greatest off spinner sensation that the world of cricket will never see again.
MURALITHARANS success in T20 cricket is nothing much to caw about because he could play in only 12 matches. Had he played in more games another record would have been his.
MURALITHARAN'S phenomenal rise did not go down well especially with the Australians who wanted their own leg spinning sensation Shane Warne to be top of the pops in world cricket.
Hurdles cleared
They endeavored and did everything possible to steel his success. But the hurdles the Aussies placed before him he hurdled like the famous and stylish Edwin Moses of the USA and breasted the tape first much to the irritation and annoyance of the baggy green caps.
MURALITHARAN was called on two occasions by Australian umpires Darrel Hair and Ross Emerson as delivering unfair deliveries which they termed chucking. Hair called him in 1995 in the Melbourne Boxing Day Test and Emerson followed Hair calling the bowler in 1999 in Adelaide.
Hair calling MURALITHARAN had all Sri Lankans fuming which prompted a Sri Lanka domiciled in Australia Basil Chitty to coin a verse in jest that read: HAIR OR NO HAIR, MURALIS BALLS ARE FAIR, much to the joy of the Sri Lankans and irritation of all Aussies.
Acrimonious tour
I was there covering this acrimonious tour for the DAILY NEWS and SUNDAY OBSERVER when Emerson called MURALITHARAN and that incident evokes memories that nearly ended the tour and had Captain Cool Arjuna Ranatungas career on the line.
I have written about this incident many a time, but to repeat the incident would be to refresh memories. Ranatunga stood by his bowler and had a finger wagging incident with Emerson, threatening to even take the team off the field.
Manager and my team mate at SBC Ranjit Fernando immediately got on the line to the then President of SLC Thilanga Sumathipala who is also the current President of the SLC who asked Fernando to tell Ranatunga to get on with the game and that he would deal with the incident.
Fernando the diplomat
Ranatunga dodged the after match press conference and Fernando who deputized took all the bouncers thrown at him by the fuming Aussie media and like a diplomat did not lose his cool but answered all questions with great aplomb.
Sumathipala in consultation with cricket representative in Australia Dr. Quintus de Zilwa a famed Cardiologist and cricket enthusiast and Fernando ordered that the best lawyers be got to defend Ranatunga who match referee former South African Captain Peter Van der Merwe was going to ask for a life ban on Ranatunga from the game.
The lawyers managed to get Captain Cool a six match suspended sentence and when Fernando broke the news exclusively to me and I broke it in return to the horde of Aussie media men that Ranatunga had got off with a suspended sentence they were livid. Along with cheer leader 'LIONEL the Legend,' Saddhatissa and some Sri Lankans in Adelaide where the inquiry was held I managed to get a few placards done one of which read: ARJUNA HERO, EMERSON ZERO and shouted slogans in front of the Adelaide Oval where a crowd had gathered to watch the England- Australia game.
Stood to a man
When MURALITHARAN was called every Sri Lankan stood to a man to support and defend him. Names that need to be mentioned are the then Sports Minister, S.B. Dissanayake and SLC President in 1995 Ana Punchihewa. He went through every testing possible in Australia and they found nothing wrong in his action, but a deformity in his wrist and that he was extending it beyond the limit.
MURALITHARAN being cleared was sweet music and joy to the Lankans and he continued to bemuse and baffle batsmen and in process earned the wrath of the Australians especially because he put to second best their leg spinning maestro Warne to a far second best.
Recently Sri Lanka Cricket named the stadium at Pallekelle MURALITHARAN INTERNATIONAL CRICKET STADIUM which was a fitting tribute to this off spinning sensation whose bowling figures in Tests and one-dayers that no bowler could even come within sniffing distance to equal or surpass.

Bedrock of Sri Lankas batting:
My best is yet to come, says Chandimal
Thursday - Handed the Test captaincy of the country at the age of 27 following Angelo Mathews resignation in July, Dinesh Chandimal has in that short space of time improved greatly not only as a captain who believes in leading his team from the front but has also improved his batting in leaps and bounds with the added responsibility.
Chandimal began his reign as captain with a stutter when he was ruled out with pneumonia in his first Test. He actually took over from the second Test of the home series against India but could not make much headway as India proved too strong making a clean sweep of the Test series 3-0.
However, unperturbed by the losses Chandimal motivated his team to a stunning 2-0 win against Pakistan in the UAE inflicting on the hosts their first-ever series loss at the venue they have now made their home.
The brilliant right-hander led the way with a match-winning century  an unbeaten 155 not out in nine hours at Abu Dhabi against a varied Pakistan bowling attack that comprised Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Abbas, Yasir Shah and Hasan Ali. He followed it up with a half century in the second Test which Sri Lanka also won and finished the series with an aggregate of 224 and an average of 74.67.
On the current tour to India, Chandimal has again been in the forefront again leading his side to prevent another whitewash at the hands of India who had to be satisfied with only a 1-0 win in the three-match series.
Chandimals batting grew during the series so that he finished with an average of 61 aggregating 366 runs. Following twin fifties in the second Test at Nagpur which Sri Lanka lost by their biggest margin in Test cricket (innings and 239 runs), he scored a monumental 164 in eight minutes under eight hours in the third and final Test at Delhi overcoming the threat of air pollution to help his team draw the Test. It was the time that Chandimal spent in the middle that denied India of a chance of victory. He has in recent times become the bedrock of the Lankan batting.
Ive never played in conditions like this before, a huge challenge. I was feeling exhausted after day three, said Chandimal. But if you love the sport, you have to do the job for your team. I have worked extremely hard on my game. When you lead your country you have to be proud. You are representing 20 million Sri Lankans and our people take a lot of pride in our cricket. That brings the best out of me. It is a good knock, but I am not satisfied. I will produce my best knock soon.
Asked if captaincy has changed his approach to the game Chandimal replied, The problem is whenever I go out to bat in recent times we are 30 for three or something. That has forced me to put my head down and play the anchor role. I try to play as straight as possible, at least for the first 30 runs. But then if the situation demands, I will make a call and go for it.
I played one sweep in Delhi actually.
It fetched me a single. This was a good wicket. On a good wicket, you have so many other scoring options. On a wicket that is turning, perhaps you can bring out the sweep and stuff like that.
The sweep is a high risk shot, said Chandimal. Then also, remember, I had got out in Nagpur in the first innings playing a reverse sweep. I felt like kicking myself after that. So I was determined to play as straight as possible here.
It was Chandimals partnership of 181 with former captain Angelo Mathews that gave Sri Lanka a first innings total of 373 and helped them avoid the follow-on.
Angelo is one hell of a player. He can change games in a couple of sessions. We depend a lot on Angelo and Rangana Herath. They are our main match winners. He is also the senior most batsmen in the side. He has played some unbelievable knocks over the years. All the youngsters look up to him, how he trains, how he plays and how he goes about things, said Chandimal.
Theres a lot to learn from that knock for the young players. How he absorbed pressure and how he makes it look all too easy when he is on song. Even I learn a lot from the way he bats. He is very good at reading situations.
He gives you some smart tips, a very clever bloke and good a student of the game.
It is no secret that after former Sri Lanka cricketer Thilan Samaraweera took over as batting coach, there has been a vast improvement in the Lankan batting which had become a sore point with the constant collapses occurring.
Personally for me, Thilan has been of immense strength as he also used to bat at number five throughout his career. He gives the team confidence.
He tells us what to do in situations, said Chandimal. His practice sessions are extremely useful. For example, when the openers are batting in the nets, he would bring up an off-spinner and a left-arm spinner, then give them two new balls and tells the openers to imagine that Ashwin and Jadeja are bowling with the new ball and to play accordingly. He tries to replicate match situations at training. Hes a great asset to us.
Being dropped from the ODI team has hurt Chandimal, but being the determined cricketer he is prepared to take it on the chin and fight back.
I am not disappointed as such. I think I had got a decent outing in UAE in ODIs, but I failed to make an impact. But I will fight my way back.
I love ODI cricket. It is a challenge for me now. I do have a few flaws. I will sort them out. I will work even harder and I will be back playing ODIs, Chandimal stated determinedly.

New generation of  Brazilians aim at  world surf glory
Saquarema: Slightly built and aged just 10, Rickson Falcao looks no match for the waves crashing onto Brazils Atlantic coast, but within seconds of launching his board, the kid surfer is transformed.
Waves rise and curl and foam and in the middle of them the tiny figure of Falcao on his shortboard swoops about like a dolphin.
He has no fear. Hell surf anything, says lifeguard Flavio Souza, 23, watching Falcao cross himself, then paddle through the booming water off the beach in Saquarema, east of Rio de Janeiro.
Brazilians have been surfing for decades. In the last few years, though, theyve got scarily good.
The sudden influx of talent even has its own name -- the Brazilian storm.
Its a storm led by superstar Gabriel Medina who blew down the doors of the sports elite club dominated by US, Hawaiian and Australian athletes when he became World Surf League champion in 2014.
The next year it was the turn of another Brazilian, Adriano de Souza, and today, 12 out of the top 44 in the rankings are from Brazil, something unimaginable just a short time ago.
Medina will get another shot at the crown when he tries to dethrone Hawaiian John John Florence at the Billabong Pipe Masters starting in Hawaii this Friday -- the last event in the 2017 championship.
And if anyone in the traditional surfing bastions still hopes that the Brazilian storm will dissipate, theyd be advised to check the forecast coming out of Saquarema. Falcao, who lives and goes to school next to the water, and spends half of every day surfing, began when he was two. Hes now racking up age-group trophies, as are several of his beach buddies -- and is remarkably focused.

## Title: New liability Mgmt. bill  to raise money above  borrowing limit: CB Chief

New liability Mgmt. bill  to raise money above  borrowing limit: CB Chief
(LBO)  Sri Lankas Central Bank Chief says the proposed liability management bill will enable the government to exceed the borrowing limit approved by the appropriation bill.
Speaking at a conference, Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said the new bill, expected to be presented in Parliament this month, will enable the government to exceed the borrowing cap for specific purposes like liability management.
Again, there would be another cap, so its not a kind of opening the door out completely; but to create some space to borrow some extra money which can be used for liability management, he said.
An appropriation bill does not enable the government to raise any money more than what is required for a particular years deficit.
So that would be used to raise some additional resources in 2018 to help us to do some switching for the money due from 2019 onwards.
Coomaraswamy said the government has decided to use the proceeds of all divestitures of public assets for debt repayments.
So, the 1.1 billion dollars which is going to come in starting from the 9th of December on the Hambantota Port lease will go into a special account for liability management,
Foreign proceeds of all divestitures will go into one account and rupee proceeds into another for liability management of foreign and rupee debt.
Central Bank Governor said Sri Lanka now has a buffer of around 100 to 110 billion to be used for the management of debt repayment peak next year.
Fortuitously for us, the last five months of this year, there were no debt maturities; so weve used that space to raise money,
Though there were no maturities, we raised 20 to 25 billion each month since August.
He said there are seven large issuance days next year and even between those there will be 4 or 5 months where Sri Lanka can raise money to boost the buffer to manage the peak.
External debt side again as you know theres a bunching from 2019 onwards, Coomaraswamy said.
Though we have something like 600 million US dollars worth of interest payments next year there is no sovereign bond maturity. So that gives us a bit of space.
Foreign liability management becomes an immediate priority as the economy is facing the largest ever foreign debt servicing requirements, clustered during 2019-2022.
Finance Minister recently said the next 3 years will be crucial with debt repayments amounting to almost 7,000 billion rupees.
This includes the repayment of international sovereign bonds which will mature every year amounting to almost 600 billion rupees.
Finance Minister added that in 2018 alone, the debt repayment amounts to 1,970 billion rupees.

No Cabinet approval for Rajapaksa Museum - FCID
The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) has informed the Colombo Magistrates Court that Cabinet approval has not been obtained for the D.A.Rajapaksa Memorial Museum in Weerakatiya, Medamulana. The project does not have the approval of the Weerakatiya Pradeshiya Sabha also, the FCID informed court, filing a report yesterday.
It was revealed that the Navy had provided manpower for the construction on the verbal instructions of former Defence Secretary, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and on the written instructions of then Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (LRDC) Chairman, Harshana de Silva.
The FCID informed court that no legal agreement had been entered into by the LRDC and project officials. The Weerakatiya Pradeshiya Sabha development officer had informed FCID that approval had not been obtained for this Museum.
The LRDC told FCID that Cabinet approval had not been obtained and the Corporation has violated financial regulations in payments made for the project. Chairman Harshana de Silva had inspected the premises with engineer Eshana Ranawake and former Speaker Chamal Rajapakse, who had come to inspect construction work. The BOQ was done on September 13, 2013 on the instructions of LRDC Chairman Harshan de Silva. LRDC legal officers acknowledged the fact that they had not monitored the project properly, since no one responsible from the project came for supervision.

Lanka ODI squad arrives in Delhi early to avoid Colombo weather
One win can turn things for us says skipper Thisara
Thursday Sri Lankas new one-day international captain all-rounder Thisara Perera is confident that his team needs only one win in the upcoming three-match ODI series against India to come out of their losing streak in this format.
Sri Lanka has not won an ODI since beating Zimbabwe by eight wickets at Hambantota in July. They have gone through their last 12 ODIs without a win which includes two 5-0 series whitewashes against Pakistan and India.
Any team can go through this its like a cycle. Theres a period that you do well, another period that you dont do so well. We cant be bringing players from other countries and play to come out of this. We have to work with the players we have, said Perera.
With the talent we have, I am satisfied that moving forward we will be alright. We lack a bit of confidence. One game if we win, everything will be fine I feel. If we do our basics right, we can win games. Dont forget that we were ranked number two or three not long ago and we should be fine moving forward.
We lacked confidence against India. If you come and see the things the boys do at training and if we can replicate that on the field, it will be totally different. My personal feeling is that when we lose regularly we lack confidence, he said.
Perera welcomed the return of Kusal Perera and Asela Gunaratne into the one-day squad after injuries.
When we were doing well, we depended a hell of a lot on them. They helped us to balance the side. I am really pleased with their arrival as it helps us to balance the side, said Perera who arrived in Delhi in the early hours of Tuesday with eight other ODI players.
Only a few guys are in the ODI outfit from the Test squad. Due to rain, we couldnt train much in Colombo so thats the reason why we tried to get to India early. We had a practice session already and have two more. We have nothing to lose, we have everything to gain. If we produce our best game, any team can be beaten, he said. Perera said that the absence of Indian captain Virat Kohli who has been rested for the series wouldnt make the Indian team weak.
Kohli is their leading batsman. However, although he is not there, they have some very good batsmen. We dont think about that too much. We think of playing our best cricket and thats what we are focused on.
Perera who replaced Upul Tharanga as the ODI captain said his new appointment gave him a lot of confidence.
They (the selectors) were impressed the way I captained the team against Pakistan. Its a huge strength for me. The confidence that they have given me I see as a big opportunity. I want to make this team a winning unit, he said. The ODI series commences at Dharmasala on December 10 and moves to Mohali on December 13 and Visakhapatnam on December 17.

Pacquiao launches bid  to unearth  Chinese  boxing  stars
BEIJING: Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao hopes to unearth the next Chinese world champion and help grow the sport with an academy in the largely untapped country.
The 38-year-old, who controversially lost his World Boxing Organization (WBO) welterweight title to Australian Jeff Horn in July, was in Beijing this week.
He and Chinese sports-development firm Dancing Sports held a signing ceremony that included plans to build a Manny Pacquiao International Boxing Academy in the capital, the company said.
Zhou Wenxin, chairman of Dancing Sports, said their tie-up would deepen Chinese-Philippine relations in boxing and beyond.
The academy will draft in coaches from abroad to help develop Chinese boxing, which has never had a truly world-class fighter. There is no public timeline for when it will be built.
Chinas most famous boxer, Zou Shiming, lost his WBO flyweight belt when he was knocked out by Japans unfancied Sho Kimura in his first defence in July.
When Pacquiaos plans for China were first announced in 2014, he said that he believed the partnership could help thaw frosty ties between the Philippines and China, who were engaged in a territorial maritime dispute in the South China Sea.
Relations have since improved considerably under current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
At the time, Pacquiao defended the decision to open a boxing academy in China instead of his own country.
In the Philippines we dont have a problem (producing good boxers), said Pacquiao, a hero in his home country and also a senator.

Palestinian Solidarity Committee condemns US Presidents move
The Sri Lanka Committee for Solidarity with Palestinian People has condemned the decision by US President Donald Trump to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of the state of Israel.
The US President has also expressed his decision to relocate the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Sri Lanka Committee for Solidarity with Palestinian People co-chairman Imtiaz Bakeer Markar said that by this announcement, the US President has killed the peace process. Besides, the U.S. now lacks moral standing to play the role of an honest broker in the Middle East peace initiative.
We strongly believe that a two-state solution is possible only within the framework of justice, with East Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Palestine, Markar said in a statement.
The committee has called on the US President to to withdraw his announcement and redouble efforts to bring freedom, justice and peace to the holy land so that the Palestinians, both the Muslims and Christians, and the Israelis could live in peace and harmony.

Palestinians Clash With Israeli Troops to Protest Trumps Jerusalem Declaration

Palestinians clashed with Israeli forces in the West Bank and along the border with Gaza on Thursday, as widespread predictions of unrest were realized a day after President Trump took the high-risk move of recognizing Jerusalem as Israels capital. Hundreds of youths clashed with Israeli forces at checkpoints.
In Gaza, youths protested along the border fence, rallied in a central Gaza City park and burned tires in a refugee camp. Dozens were injured, at least one seriously. After nightfall, two rockets were fired at Israel from Gaza. The Israeli military said they had fallen short and landed inside the Palestinian coastal territory.
The Israeli military said it was sending additional battalions to the West Bank in response to the protests. Trumps decision ignited other protests across the region, from the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon to Tunisia. Hundreds of Jordanians protested outside the United States Embassy in Amman and called for its closing, chanting, America is the head of the snake. At a news conference in Baghdad, Moqtada al-Sadr, an influential Iraqi Shiite cleric, called for a unified Arab Spring against Israel.
Jihadist groups from Somalia to Syria and from Yemen to Afghanistan issued venomous statements about Trumps decision. In Palestinian areas, schools were closed, stores were shuttered and the public largely observed a general strike.
The mood in the streets of downtown East Jerusalem, where there was a heavy Israeli police presence, was tense and sullen. In Gaza, Ismail Haniya, the leader of Hamas, the Islamic militant group, called for a new intifada, or uprising, saying, Trump will regret this decision.
The Palestinians have undertaken two major uprisings since the late 1990s, leading to hundreds of deaths on both sides, but many Palestinians say they ultimately did little to advance their cause.
Trumps recognition of Jerusalem, which upended longstanding American policy and broke with international consensus, continued to draw condemnation from Arab and European leaders.
Critics have argued that unilaterally recognizing Israels claim to the city prejudged the outcome of any negotiations for a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Palestinian aspire for an independent state with East Jerusalem, which has holy sites sacred to Christians, Jews and Muslims, as its capital.
Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, and other officials in the West Bank said the United States had disqualified itself from any mediating role. Abbas has repeatedly stated that he does not want a third intifada on his watch.
His Fatah party has called for nonviolent protests in the West Bank. Federica Mogherini, the European Unions top foreign policy official, warned that the decision would be damaging to the peace effort. President Trumps announcement on Jerusalem has a very worrying potential impact, she said.
It has a very fragile context and the announcement has the potential to send us backwards to even darker times than the ones we are already living in. In Beirut, Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanese militant organization Hezbollah, called for governments to withdraw their ambassadors from Tel Aviv and take other steps that go beyond making statements.
The American secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, said in Vienna that the United States was still committed to the peace process and that a two-state solution to resolve the conflict was still viable.

Mirijjawila-Sooriyawewa Road Construction : Previous regime forcibly acquired land: Kiriella
The previous government had acquired lands worth Rs. 1,992 million forcefully to construct the Mirijjawila-Sooriyawewa Road, Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said in Parliament yesterday.
The Minister was responding to a query posed by JVP Parliamentarian Nihal Galappaththi by way of an adjournment motion on November 28.
He said the previous regime was acquiring the lands to construct the questionable 100-feet road since 2009 but had not paid a penny to the owners. The good governance government has provided payments for them, the Minister said. Minister Kiriella said his Ministry had paid Rs. 370.2 million since 2015 to the owners of 281 lands and another set of vouchers worth Rs. 101.1 million were forwarded to the Ministry as payment for 128 plots.
He said the previous government had acquired 1,958 plots in the Hambantota and Sooriyawewa Divisional Secretariats and 1,534 of them were private. "These owners have to be paid," Minister Kiriella said.
"Rights of the deeds of 1,125 lands are investigated at the Hambantota and Sooriyawewa Divisional Secretariats and when the investigations are completed, compensation will be paid," the Minister said.
He said the 23.5 km long road was constructed with six lanes whereas four tracks would have been sufficient.
Govt. will establish integration friendly schools: Fowzie
The Government will establish integration friendly schools by bringing children of all ethnicities and religions together to bring reconciliation to the country, National Integration State Minister A. H. M. Fowzie said in Parliament yesterday.
He made these observations yesterday in Parliament, while the House was considering the report of the select committee on the Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Ministry, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry, Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Ministry and National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry during the Committee Stage debate on the budget proposal for financial year 2018.
The State Minister said that introducing such schools was initiated on a concept of President Maithripala Sirisena, who holds the National integration Ministerial portfolio.
"The Integration friendly schools would help the child be aware of diverse cultures and respect them," the State Minister said.
"The policy of the government is to eliminate hate speech. The government has plans to establish district reconciliation committees to resolve ethnic and religious tension at district level. Religious dignitaries would head these committees," he said.
The State Minister said the week from January 8 to January 14 would be declared as the national reconciliation week. He said many programmes were planned for the week.
Reconciliation reflects in Parliament
Signs of reconciliation were seen in Parliament when Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister Palani Digambaram responded in Sinhala to Joint Opposition member Mahindananda Aluthgamage, who spoke in Tamil.
The conversation took place when MP Aluthgamage was speaking on the report of the select committee on the Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Ministry, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry, National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Ministry and National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry during the Committee Stage debate on the budget proposal for financial year 2018 in Parliament yesterday.
Minister Dingabaram emphasised the commendable services rendered to the hill country people when MP Aluthgamage criticised the government for its failure to fulfil the need of the upcountry people.
This government failed to fulfil the aspirations of the Tamil people in the upcountry, MP Aluthgamage said. They elected the government with high hopes. We had worked for them very much when we were in power, Aluthgamage said.
Minister Digambaram said the government has served the hill country Tamil people more than any other previous government. This government has given deeds to those people who never had a plot, Digambaram said. The previous government promised only 50,000 houses to those people. I appreciate MP Aluthgamage though. He gave a playground to people there when he was minister, he said.
I developed the Westhall Estate Hospital for your people, MP Aluthgamage said. Your government took it. Your name would be written in history if you constructed houses, he said.
Failure in reconciliation and national integration : Bimal calls for ministers resignation
The ministers dealing with reconciliation and national integration should resign from their positions since they were not able to use the funds allocated through last year's budget for the purpose, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake said in Parliament yesterday.
He spoke, while the house was considering the report of the select committee on the Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Ministry; Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry; National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Ministry and National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry during the committee stage debate on the budget proposal for financial year 2018.
He said the Resettlement Ministry had spent only 44 percent of its allocations as at September 30 and the National Integration Ministry had not used 91 percent of the allocation it received.
"The funds were allocated to bring solutions for the burning issues of the people. But the ministries had failed in their tasks," the JVP MP said.
The MP stated that the Ministers failed to fulfil the people's needs, but they enjoy all the perks and privileges. He said the ministries had a great responsibility to prevent a conflict from recurring such as the one that plagued the country for three decades.
He said 3,000 persons were in 39 welfare centres and the government was attempting to lease 11 fisheries harbours crucial for the country's defence. "Around 28,500 Sri Lankan asylum seekers in India who were granted citizenship in that country want to return to Sri Lanka, but they have no facilities to return,"the MP said.

We provide a safe space for them to play, and be children again. This Christmas we are thrilled to be partnering with The Body Shop. Every gift you buy from their seasonal gift collections will help bring a smile to a Syrian childs face. What a great way to share the spirit of Christmas.

Sarasavi Rangamadala comes to life!
Drama performed on stage is the earliest form of Drama. However drama heard on radio certainly has its own unique appeal. It has its own fascination. Here all depends on the magnetic quality of the voice. Until the arrival of television, radio was the medium of news and entertainment. And still radio is a favourite amongst all ages.
Sarasavi Rangamadala is a radio drama series which is a collaborative effort of the Faculty of Mass Media of the Sri Palee Campusof the Colombo University and the SLBC Commercial Service. This radio drama series features short stories of the past and modern day. The works of Ediriweera Sarathchandra and Martin Wickramasinghe comes to life on radio.
The opening ceremony of Sarasavi Rangamadala will be held on December 9 at the SLBC premises Kumaratunga auditorium at 6.30pm. It will be aired on every Wednesday at 8pm. It is a 30 min radio drama that will carry on for one year.
Dramatic moves speaks to Colombo University, Sri Palee Campus, Mass Media Department, Lecturer, Dilan Dharshana and his students on this exciting event.
Sri Palee Campus of the Colombo University has two Faculties and they are the Faculty of Performing Arts and the Faculty of Mass Media. Under the Faculty of Performing Arts, Music, Dancing, Art, Drama and Theatre, Screen Studies and Art and Design are taught as main subjects. Under the Faculty of Mass Media, Radio, Print, Television and Media Studies are the main subjects taught.
The biggest problem that we see in the Mass Media industry is that the students only know theory. But they do not understand and do not know how to handle the practical side of it. One purpose of the Faculty of Mass Media at Sri Palee Campus is to create a human being with theoretical and practical knowledge, along with creativity. I feel this is essential. A student must know how to apply himself or herself in practical way. This radio drama series is our answer to this, said Dharshana.
By doing this radio drama series, the student is taught how to write a drama script, how to enhance his or her powers of audibility, how to think creatively and how to put together a production.
I also feel that students should be encouraged to read. They need to read extensively on many subjects. With this drama series they will be encouraged to read because this drama series will feature short stories. So this is the ideal opportunity to get them to read such stories by Ediriweera Sarathchandra and Martin Wickremasinghe and also modern day short stories, stated Dharshana.
Getting the right people involved was difficult initially. It took some time for this concept to get ingrained in the students. They did not realize that they could do something like this in the first place. They did not realize what was inside of them. They did not realize their potential.
Then we had to create a media society. That took some time as well. But once the students got familiarized with the concept the numbers started to grow. Having been a student at Sri Palee Campus of the Colombo University I have plenty of knowledge when it comes to the practical side of matters. Right now we have around 30 to 35 students.
This will have a ripple effect where subsequent generations will also be trained in this manner, pointed out Dharshana.
These are extremely interesting and captivating short stories that are very relevant to modern day society. They show the genius of the old masters. These are some of the finest short stories ever to have been written.
The goal of University education is creating a well -balanced human being with a creative side. This can be done by any form of drama be it radio or plays. He or she should be able to contribute to the betterment of society. He or she should be energetic and resourceful.
This should come from within the University. Professor Sarathchandra used the university students in his works. The University students took part in all of that. I feel the university needs that kind of environment.
We need students who have more than qualifications. We need them to be versatile role models who can think differently. So this is a little step along the way, explained Dharshana. Dharshana would like to thank the following people who helped him  Visiting Lecturers Janaka Mahabellana, Pradeep Jayarathna, SLBC, Chairman, Sudarshana Gunawardena, SLBC Deputy Director General, Mayuri Abeysinghe, Commercial Service Controller, Chandani De Silva, Sujeewa Harischandra, Producer, Sarasavi Rangamadala, Nishantha Kariyapperuma, Rector, Sri Palee Campus, Prof. Ranjan Hettiarachchi and Acting Head, Sri Palee Campus, Dr. Dharmakeerthi Sri Ranjan and also Sound Engineer and Programme Assistant Sandaruwan Liyanage.
The reality of life
Sri Palee Campus print media student, Shyamalee Devikafelt that it has been a wonderful example of the great feats that can be achieved when people come together. Like Rajakaruna, she also felt that qualities hidden inside of her had been brought out.
I am a print media student and I never really had the chance to collaborate with students from different streams as I have done in this programme. In the Mass Media faculty the streams are Print, TV, Radio and Media studies. I am a third year student. We never thought that this would be such a success. So we familiarized ourselves by reading short stories. We discovered its depth. We had discourses. That was how we got the ideas to write our scripts. We never thought that we were this good and we never thought that we had this in us. In a way we never thought, our abilities came out. The abilities that were hidden within us came out, said Devika.
Devika pointed out that a good writer is able to portray the characters in real life society and that nature of society itself is in his or her works. He or she is able to show the reality of life in his or her works. The characters in novels come to life in our minds. We are able to relate to these characters because we find something in common with these characters. We receive pleasure and the knowledge from reading about these characters. That same experience we can get out of listening to this show on the radio.
People are so busy nowadays that they do not have time to read books. But maybe in the car they can listen on the radio. This programme can do that. There is a sense of freedom for me in doing this programme. It is stimulating and enjoyable. It is a great experience, stated Devika.
A big responsibility
Sri Palee Student, Tachini Rajakaruna never realized she had such abilities within her. She never realized that her mind had such untapped potential. Taking part in this programme has been a great experience. I do media studies at Campus and that is theory based, with exams.
I am a third year student. I have never quite done something which is fully practical. I took part in this out of curiosity when I was told by sir. We did not think that something like this could actually happen! The first day we did script writing.
Then we had a full day workshop and there was a recording. Then we thought that this could actually go forwards, said Rajakaruna Rajakaruna pointed out that she is not much of a writer for she had never written scripts before.
So then we were all told to write scripts. I was in shock, because like I said before I am not much of a writer. Writing a script is a big responsibility. So I told the lecturer if writing the script is compulsory I would like to leave the programme. Then the lecturer told me to give it a try.
So I wrote a script and told the lecturer not to place very high expectations on what I had done. So at the end there were a number of scripts written by a group of us and from that two were chosen, and from the two one was mine!, said Rajakaruna. This shows that we all have skills and potential within us and what happened was that the lecturer was able to bring it out of Rajakaruna. Then that was developed. So now I am writing scripts and I am fulfilling my potential. Now so many people are coming on board. Now I feel strong and I feel I have found that which was within me, stated Rajakaruna.
Somethingdifferent


Sri Palee Campus student, Anuruddha Sena Dhilankara felt that as students the experience is an eye opener.
As University students by doing this programme we look at all of this from a different angle. There is something special about it. We look at society from a certain angle. Because of this I feel that this programme is something unique.
Radio drama is something different because everything depends on the voice and its different tones and manifestations.
What I have got from radio drama is that I have discovered something about myself when it comes to interacting with students.
Through doing programmes like this you come to understand human character. You learn how to work with people. You enact so many characters.
You come to understand life itself. You understand the problems people face.
I can definitely say that I am a much stronger person having done drama, said Dhilankara.

Schoolchildren should not end up in jail - State Defence Secretary
It is discovered that 44 percent of the prisoners in Sri Lanka had received school education only up to grade five or less.
But schoolchildren in the country should not end up in jail and they should become useful citizens who contribute towards the development of the country, State Defence Secretary Sunil Samaraweera said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Defence Ministry in Colombo <U+200B>on December 6<U+200B> he said that there are about four million schoolchildren in Sri Lanka at the moment and they receive education in around 9,600 schools under 200,000 teachers.
But all students cannot become doctors, engineers and lawyers. Somehow the students who cannot become professionals should become useful citizens to the country and society. According to the State Defence Secretary Samaraweera, the students of Defence College sit for the Ordinary Level Examination for the first time this year and the students in Kurunegala Branch will sit for the O/L next year.
The skills of schoolchildren need to be developed and sports are essential for this. Becoming cadets help them to become excellent citizens with all types of skills which will be useful all the time especially during emergencies such as natural disasters.
The country needs a skilled and fully developed human capital in order to achieve development. All the other skills of the schoolchildren should be developed parallel to education.
Otherwise, they fail to face the challenges of life. Developing skills in children prevent them from getting addicted to drugs and other anti-social behaviours. The training enable them to achieve any target, he added.

SLJGJ condemns US decision on Jerusalem
Sri Lankan Journalists for Global Justice (SLJGJ) has vehemently condemned the decision of US President Donald Trump to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and move its Embassy there from Tel Aviv.
This move endangers the prospect of peace, security and stability in the Middle East, violates the rights of the Palestinian people to a State of their own and justifies the illegal occupation of Arab and Palestinian lands by Israel, SLJGJ President Jayatilleke de Silva said in a statement.
SLJGJ considers the status of Jerusalem as a matter to be decided as part of a final solution to the Palestinian problem between Israel and Palestine and any attempt to change its present status is a retrograde step, in its opinion.
SLJGJ has called upon the government of Sri Lanka to immediately disassociate itself with the position of the United States in this matter in accordance with the wishes of the Sri Lankan public and join forces world over that call for a negotiated settlement respecting the national aspirations of the Palestinian people and the decisions of the United Nations.

Co-Chair, International Conference on Business Management, Department of Finance, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Dr. Chandana Gunathilaka has issued the following message for the event.
CBM 2017 goes with a topical theme, Managing Interface: Corporate Resilience and Growth Potential.
Dictionary defines interface as a surface regarded as the common boundary of two bodies, spaces, or phases; the facts, problems, considerations, theories, practices and shared by two or more disciplines, procedures, or fields of study; a common boundary or interconnection between systems, equipment, concepts, or human beings.
We face many different interfaces, it is full of interfaces in our life! You handle your buying behavior of household items, how much your buying decision is influenced by media advertisements An advertisement makes a connection between you and the product or service they talk. The television makes connections, differentiations and separations between you and some people, products, or politicians. You deal with your employer and your success (i.e. strength of connection or separation) depends on how you deal with employer.
Similar to this, within the business boundaries today, there are many interfaces to be involved. Other than short term interfaces like the boundary between customer and business, organization and other organizations, insiders and outsiders, employees and employers, there are interfaces between long term growth objectives and sustainability. Public organizations use public money and there arises an interface between managers and investors objectives.
Manufacturers should care production and environmental damages. Among many, interfaces also arise between customers and firm; markets and culture; new knowledge and applications; within technology management; goals of the firm and national goals; inter-organizational networks and many more.
Thus, what is the role of a manager, consultant, advisers and scholars in managing these complex interfaces One should note that the management here does not mean controlling. Managing here refers to administration of an interface, a situation, an interconnection, or interstitial space to optimize the benefits possible.
When it come to higher level business management, it is significant to understand that the size, time horizon, level of risk, gravity and profitability of different interfaces determine the organizations sustainable growth. Information flow to and from organization, crossing all the boundaries, are at unprecedented rates today. The power of social networks can never be undermined; these demand multiple strategies in managing.
The characteristics of dynamics are of course show a non-linear form. It demands us to re-think whether we need to define our missions, policies and appear as a separate entity from all others! Because it can mean we are not willing to connect with others in the wider span of interstitial space.
For instance, one of the six objectives of a public trading company is Grow our Revenue and Profits at a rate above the current Industry Norm. So now, the company has defined its separation at the interface for community expectations from a Sri Lankas business unit. Community may require a company to align with national objectives. Should a company think to lead their industry at the expense our small market and customer
This objective means that the company sells however more than the other companies in the industry do. Instead, it can lead at least Asian market, lead in technology, and draw revenue from sources that are beyond boundaries.
It can interact with community objectives, not the profit rate, and design objectives so that it reduces the cost of separation. On the other hand, this objective creates another interface, where a discussion requires on how accountable should organizations be for the economic and social consequences of their actions at the interface

Tally Solutions addresses CA  Sri Lanka on making the best of ERP
Baradhwaj, Manager International Business of Tally Solutions India Limited, addressed members of CA Sri Lanka at the CA Sri Lanka auditorium on November 24 emphasizing the importance of a proper implementation of an ERP (enterprise resource planning) system to get to best out of such a system.
Although great business is built on great products, technology is increasingly the underlying driver of a company's success, regardless of the industry or marketplace. From accounting and point-of-sale systems to inventory and fulfilment technology, the efficacy of the solutions you invest in has the potential to make or break your business. Hence, it is vital that the organization selects the correct technology at the very outset.
Baradhwaj pointed out that there may not be anything called 'right' or 'wrong' technology but it is essential to keep ROI in mind in adopting the technology, otherwise the very purpose may be lost. He brought in five facts to be used as a guideline in selecting the technology as cost, deployment and scalability, user access, accessibility and security depending upon the organization.
Most commercial ERP systems are known for certain industry verticals and hence it is extremely important to select the most suitable product where the chartered accountants have a vital role to play since they know exactly what they need.
Once the appropriate technology and the product are selected, the organization has to follow a set of well-defined steps of implementation from setting up objectives till the Go-Live phase in a pre-determined time frame.
Baradhwaj emphasized the fact though all these are done in a perfect manner, if the organization does not analyze the data in all the possible angles and convert them to information, there may not be a direct impact from the ERP towards the growth of business.
Baradhwaj concluded his speech by summarizing the fact that choosing a technology and the software which is the right fit for your business, i.e., a product which is designed to fit into your scheme of things. Be it handling exceptions that you may face in your day to day operations or adapting to your way of working, the software should handle everything with the required flexibility. Also, it should empower you to focus on running and growing your business while it takes care of all complexities.

Unilever, UNDP and UNGC initiate strategic PPPs around 2030 Agenda
Unilever Sri Lanka, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Sri Lanka and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Sri Lanka together announced the initiation of strategic public-private partnerships (PPPs) around the countrys key priorities related to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), yesterday.
The partnerships revealed at the event were a result of the inaugural Unilever-UNGC forum held earlier this year that engaged members of the public and private sector, academia, media and non-government development agencies on how they could work together on helping Sri Lanka achieve the goals.
A wave of sustainable business projects are set to be rolled out through these partnerships. Aitken Spence Holdings, Commercial Bank PLC, Dialog Axiata PLC, MAS Holdings and Unilever Sri Lanka have pledged their support to drive these projects.
Carl Cruz, Chairman, Unilever Sri Lanka said, The countrys goals around the 2030 SDGs cannot be achieved through the efforts of any single entity, acting alone. We need to rally each other up, go outside our comfort zones and work together to help the nation realize its vision.
We firmly believe that adopting sustainable models both in civil service and in business while mobilizing collective action will help bring longer lasting, wide spread positive change. This is the only way in which we can ensure that we move ahead as one, without leaving anyone behind. We are excited about the journey ahead as we work with them and other partners who have come forward in support this mission to see these projects to fruition.
Additional Secretary to the President, Jayantha Wijeratne said while the government continues to work towards bringing about sustainable development, they need to understand that this cannot be done without the involvement and support of the private sector and all other stakeholders.
He also commended Unilever, UNDP and UNGC for their efforts in shaping such partnerships, together with Aitken Spence, Commercial Bank, Dialog and MAS.
UNDP Sri Lanka Country Director, Jorn Sorensen, This is the start of a new movement. By connecting businesses with governments and the development partners, we can create an environment that unleashes the potential of the private sector because investing in sustainable development is a win-win. As such, the private sector is an important strategic partner for UNDP in achieving its vision to help countries eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities and exclusion within broader sustainable development.
Jegan Durairatnam, Managing Director/CEO, Commercial Bank PLC, said that the bank has integrated sustainability into its business operations whilst also concentrating on developing communities. We employ very stringent measures to evaluate sustainability of any credit proposal before we finance it. In addition we also are training our staff on identifying sustainable development projects and assisting them.
He also said that project, Sunlight providing special financing terms to install solar energy to Unilever dealers and Saubghya project, providing financial facilities for women entrepreneurs in rural areas blends in well with the bank's sustainability principles.
Shayam Majeed, Group Chief Customer Officer, Dialog Axiata PLC, said that the introduction of GSM technology itself brought tremendous positive impact specially to the rural community.
He also said that the ongoing Govi Mithuru project conducted jointly with Ministry of Agriculture too helping over 4,000 farmers to get agri updates via their mobile phones.
Shakthi Ranatunga, Director - Group Human Resources, MAS Holdings, in his message said that they are also involved in training under graduates in apparel skills. Our program Garments without Guilt too has received good response from all over the world.
Dr. Rohan Fernando, Chairman of United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and Director, Aitken Spence also shared their views on the forum and spelled out the way forward. He also said today the demands and issues of the society have changed from that of two decades ago and the corporate sector too should change their CSR projects to suit these new areas.
Unilever also announced its partnership with UNDP to host a high-level private sector forum on sustainable human development every year, starting from 2018. (SS)

The government will set up a US $ 4 million Programmatic Project Preparation Facility (PPPF) to ensure the smooth implementation of public investment projects.
A Cabinet paper forwarded by the Prime Minister this week noted in the 2017 Country Portfolio Programme Performance Review (CPPR), that the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs and the World Bank were of the view that lengthy project preparation and inception processes have an adverse impact in achieving the desired outcomes and smooth implementation of the projects.
The World Bank, thus, has agreed to provide prior funding for the World Bank-funded development projects through the PPPF to carry out successful project preparation, design and initial implementation activities.
The PPPF, the Cabinet paper stated, will provide the government, the certainty of funding availability for preparatory activities, allowing government entities to plan and prepare public investments efficiently.
The objectives of the PPPF have been described as, to improve quality at the inception of projects, to improve the implementation mechanisms, to enhance the capacity within implementing agencies of the GoSL and to produce standard project preparation documents.
The PPPF is to be centrally managed and coordinated by the National Planning Department of the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs and implemented through various Project Implementation Units (PIU).
Its timeframe is three years from July 2017 to June 2020 and will expire at the end of the current Country Partnership Framework (June 2020). The World Bank will monitor the implementation progress of the PPPF and project teams of the World Bank will work directly with the PIUs to ensure that the PPPF is implemented as expected.
The Cabinet also granted approval to allocate US $ 3 million for project preparatory activities of the PPPF for the year 2018. They also allocated Rs. 20 million in 2018 from the Consolidated Fund for the Foreign Finance Associated Domestic Expenses of the PPPF to cover taxes and other administrative expenses.

Ward system good for SL - MP
Kalutara District UPLF Parliamentarian Vidura Wickramanayaka said, it is so good to have the Local Govt Election under Ward System ending political rivalry.
The voters must decide to elect honest local politicians who would not commit corruption and thuggery in the respective areas. Otherwise the voters have to suffer after the Local Govt Election. The elected Councillor have to take the responsibility of developing the area, if not the voters can remove him at the next Local Govt Election, said MP Wickramanayaka.
He said that an honest politician could do a lot of work to the society. He appealed to the voters to elect honest politicians to the wards of the Local Councils who could cooperate to uplift the economy in the areas.

Wearing A Mask  In Delhi..!
During the last and final test between Sri Lanka and India, pollution masks were worn by the Sri Lankan team on the field, with cricketer Suranga Lakmal even vomiting on the field.
I think we are making a mountain of a molehill! said an Indian political heavy weight who lived in the capital, Masks have always been worn in the Indian capital, and it is only right that when in Rome do what we Romans do!
Whoa! Whoa! I exclaimed as another Sri Lankan player started coughing and throwing up on the field and their harried doctor was called to assist him in his breathing, How could you make such a callous statement
Well, said the politician, Just look at Prime Minister Modi!
I looked in the direction of Gujarat where I saw a white-bearded white-haired man campaigning for the elections, Surely you are wrong
Look closely, smiled the seasoned politician, Is this the same man who you see in Delhi Is this the same man who hugged Trump a few months back, who warmly congratulated the Miss World last week
No! I said rather reluctantly, he speaks rough and acts harshly!
In Delhi hes one man, during elections another man Do you think there are two Modis One so pleasant and patient and the other blowing volcanic fire, spewing venom with vengeance on all his opponents while campaigning
Its strange! I whispered.
Its a mask! said the seasoned politician. As soon as he steps into Delhi he starts wearing a mask of humility and meekness! Now forget the Prime Minister, can you see that boy over there
Yes! I said as I saw a boy with dimpled cheek running towards his mother. Seems quite a sweet little fellow! I like the way hes running, just to be hugged!
Now watch his front door as he steps out again, wearing his mask!
A little later I watched the door open and a confident man stepping out, eyes focused and speech ready to be delivered. I watched as he boarded a plane to an election state and watched as he delivered a biting speech against Modi, Why! I said with astonishment, Thats Rahul Gandhi!
The same little boy you saw running to be cuddled stepped out a different man, how asked the political heavy weight smirking at me, Tell me how
Hes got a mask on! I admitted lamely.
Exactly! said the politician turning in the direction of Sri Lanka, When the capital of our country requires you to put on a mask, just put it on and dont complain!
The Sri Lankans had to do it, because everybody in Delhi does it! I agreed, shrugging my shoulders as the bus with the islands cricketers, staring with agony through their pollution masks, drove straight to the hospital..!

He said that all essential items will be sold at controlled prices at islandwide Lanka Sathosa outlets during the festive season in a bid to bring down the cost of living.
He further said that ample stocks of essential items have been stored in warehouses.

Tennakoon said that eight rice varieties, sprats, big onions, local potatoes, canned fish, milk powder,sugar,dhal and wheat flour would be sold at reduced prices, while assuring that good quality stocks of these items would be available without any shortage in Lanka Sathosa outlets across the country.

All prisons will be modernised: Minister Swaminathan
The Angunakolapellessa Prison was opened with all modern facilities including CCTV monitoring recently. The Pallekele and Jaffna Prison are under construction. The Welikada, Galle, Matara, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Kegalle, Wariyapola Prisons and Mannar lockup will be relocated, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M.

Infrastructure and Community Development Ministry; Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry; National Coexistence, Dialogue and Official Languages Ministry, and National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry during the Committee Stage debate on the budget proposal for financial year 2018.
He said the Welikada Prison was congested and it would be shifted to Dompe within a few years. A suitable land had already been sourced and to construct a building on it would take approximately two and a half years.
The Prison Department has developed a Prison Information Management System and action is taken to develop Biometric information assisted by the Telecommunication Ministry to exchange necessary information online, the Minister said.
Around Rs. 250,000 is needed for a day to provide facilities to rehabilitate minor offenders as per 2016 reports, the Minister said.
He proposed that the community based correction must be carried out as it is cost effective. Minister Swaminathan said Rs. 14.050 million was allocated for the Accelerated Resettlement Programme under his ministry in 2016, while several resettlement and development projects were implemented last year to alleviate the issues faced by the conflict affected people in the North and East, and the border villages in Puttalam, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.
He said that under his ministry, 11,253 houses, 7,598 sanitation units and 1,293 public wells were constructed and 2,216 partially damaged wells during the war were renovated in 2016.
In addition, 187 roads, 27 hospitals and 66 schools were renovated and 8,902 water connections were provided in 2016. Under the livelihood assistance project, 12,757 families were provided equipment worth Rs. 100,000 each, he said.All these efforts reduced poverty in the North and East, he said.
Minister Swaminathan said that almost 165,000 families were identified as IDPs and with a meagre allocations in 2016 and 2017, only 17,000 were resettled under the owner driven programme. Under the accelerated resettlement programme, the Ministry had initiated 65,000 prefabricated housing programmes with 100 percent financing, and eventually Cabinet approved 6,000.
He said the Parliamentary Select Committee was briefed on the plight of the displaced. I earnestly hope parliament would allocate at least Rs. 15 billion for my ministry to facilitate the accelerated rehabilitation programme to achieve the target of the government to fulfil the recommendations of the LLRC, he said.

Amant Ignites  with a series  of events
Amant Ignites recently hosted the teams from Saaraketha Organics, Kitsch&, and Flow Health Bar for a session that was a fun and timely reminder- eating well doesnt have to be boring. Guests listened to the teams talk about their drive for clean eating, and watched demonstrations on using good, locally sourced ingredients to create delectable meals. The guests were then challenged to a salad-off and given take-home tips from the teams at Saaraketha and Flow.
Then there was the event Wine, Cheese and Words with a reading by Ashok Ferrey, Ameena Hussein and Savithri Rodrigo. Held at the amant boutique at Racecourse Mall, the evening of books and banter was attended by amant Enchantresses, the brands name for its loyal customer base.
They were there to participate in a discussion led by Gratiaen Prize nominated author Ashok Ferrey, whose novels explore the fallacies of being Sri Lankan, alongside author, editor and publisher Ameena Hussein and media powerhouse Savithri Rodrigo.
The first workshop was a facial yoga session by Om Space founder, Serena Burgess who taught attendees how to use facial muscle relaxing techniques. Participants spent a morning learning how to tone and stretch facial muscles, increase circulation and reduce the appearance of wrinkles for a rejuvenated glow with their instructor.
The second amant Ignites event brought in makeup and hairstylist experts Shane and Vinod from Arq Style House to demonstrate day-to-evening hairstyles and makeup looks. For the third edition, experiential travel expert Rukmankan Sivaloganathan of Trekurious divulged his secrets on trending travel destinations, activity and adventure travel and the off-the-beaten path hotspots for travellers in Sri Lanka.
Sivaloganathan began his session with a quick round up of Colombos own hidden gems, then taking his guests on an adventure around Sri Lanka with the vivid pictures he painted with word on his travels. The next, a session by Power of Play, Founder, Sulochana Dissanayake and Creative therapist, Seema Omar focused on how parents could meaningfully connect with kids over school holidays. The group learnt how to create a fun space for their kids using simple household items coupled with a heady dose of imagination. The duo also shared a wealth of useful reading material with the participants, who engaged in active learning sessions fuelled by what they had learnt.
Ive attended most of the sessions hosted by amant over the last few months and theyve been so much fun, shared Sharon, a loyalty customer at the latest event. Each new session has built on the expectation set by the one before, and the most recent Wine, Cheese and Words event with the writers sparked such an interesting conversation-it was truly a privilege to listen to them talk about what led them to writing, and how they have kept their writing alive and engaging all these years. She also added, I have been returning to amant since I first visited a few years ago because theres always something fresh and exciting in store. These events are a bonus for customers like me-Im really looking forward to the next one!

Appropriate technology centre celebrates 33 years of service to the nation
The Appropriate Technology Research and Development Centre (ATRDC) Pannala, Kurunegala, which is a collaboration between the governments of Sri Lanka and Japan, will celebrate 33 years of serving the nation through the use of Appropriate Technology (AT).
ATRDC Pannala was established in February 1985 on the basis of a technical cooperation agreement between the Sri Lanka government and the Japanese government.
The agreement was jointly implemented by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Industrial Development Board of Sri Lanka (IDB), a statutory Board under the then Ministry of Rural Industrial Development.
The sole purpose of this project was to help the rural sector develop through the use of appropriate technology which is considered the most suitable and affordable for rural sector small and medium scale industries.
While the Sri Lanka government contributed towards this project to the tune of Rs. 9 million, by end 1986, the Japanese government made its contribution to the success of the project in the form of providing experts, training, machinery and equipment to the value of US$ 1.9 million, by end May 1987.
As the country grapples with the problem of garbage disposal and begins to implement the ban on polythene products, one machine invented by the ATRDC comes into focus: an incinerator which effectively turns of garbage including hard polythene into compost fertilizer in pellet form, which has been manufactured for the use of the Pradeshiya Sabha, Matale.
The incinerator with three chambers - press, burner and pelletizer - has been approved by relevant authorities including the Central Environmental Authority. According to officials of the Pradeshiya Sabha, the incinerator is functioning well. As the machine releases gas above 60 feet from ground level, it effectively removes any health hazard.
ATRDC Resident Director Sarath Gunarathne said the Centre manufactures similar machines on request, with the positive results as experienced by the Matale Pradeshiya Saba, at affordable prices.
The Centre has been doing a tremendous service to the nation in the past three decades by inventing new machinery and other equipment to successfully meet the challenges that crop up from time to time.
The Centre also conducts training programmes in welding/fitting, manufactures low cost wooden furniture, roller shutters and collapsible doors and engages in light engineering. ATRDC provides training and valuation, technology transfer and advisory services, visits industries and lends them necessary assistance.
Grinders, belt hammers, broom handles, milling machines, lawn mowers, electric potters wheels and crushers are among the other machines manufactured by the Centre.
The aims and objective of the government in establishing ATRDC was to improve living standards of the rural polity and also create employment opportunities, using to the maximum existing human and natural resources. The government is keen to develop this sector through an integrated development of the economy without disturbing the social, cultural and ecological fabric of society.
