CIM SL's inaugural talking point programme for 2018 discusses emerging business trends
The Chartered Institute of Marketing Sri Lanka hosted its inaugural Talking Point Programme for 2018 recently on a topical theme 'Ten Emerging Trends that will shape business in 2018'.
The thought-provoking session drew viewpoints from an eminent panel including experts in economics, research and from the corporate sector. The programme highlighted key consumer, macro-economic and market trends expected during the year which will have an impact on the local business arena.
CIM SL organizes regular Talking Point programmes with an objective to highlight emerging themes in marketing and business and also to discuss best practices to support marketers' future strategic decisions. These events provide participants a platform to share and exchange key insights and are attended by Business leaders, CIM Members and Corporate Executives.
The speakers during this year's inaugural programme were Shiran Fernando, Chief Economist, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Abhishek Hariharan, Associate Vice President and Head of Strategic Planning, MullenLowe Sri Lanka and Chitrangani Herat Gunaratne, Senior Consultant, Quantum Consumer Solutions Pvt Ltd. The panel discussion was moderated by Brandon Morris-Director/CEO, AMW Capital Leasing & Finance PLC.
Addressing the gathering, Fernando said, "Moving into 2018, while the global economic picture is looking brighter and forecasters looking at the positivity to continue in 2018, locally, the common theme is the relative stability that is coming through."
Discussing a wide range of topics including stability, risks, sector insights, future outlook and possible opportunities within the reform process he noted, "On the local front, a key development that we are seeing is consistency in terms of policy.
"Opportunities within the reform process is unique. A stable macro picture will provide more confidence for investors. We also need to build on the gains received from the GSP plus, building on this momentum will not only help big companies but SMEs too," he added.
Commenting on possible risks during the ensuing year Fernando said, "Global oil prices rising, local elections ramifications, tightening financial conditions globally and the country also faces an average external debt repayment of $3.6 billionper annum during the 2019-2022 period."
On an optimistic note he added, "We are looking at 4.5% growth in 2018. However, what really matters is to encourage investment thereby improving FDI numbers and then consumption as the value chain gets impacted by it."Fernando concluded stating, "Stability is important and we need to build on it in 2018, navigating the external risks.
Providing an in depth focus on modern consumer trends and how marketers can apply these insights in building successful brands, Chitrangani Herat Gunaratne and Abhishek Hariharan discussed ten interesting emerging trends based on recent research.
Commenting on the current context, Hariharanstated "It is critical to deeply understand consumers and what makes them tick. Brands that smartly use tensions and contexts can enjoy a competitive advantage. The emerging imperative for businesses today is not just stability but agility and the ability to respond to and exploit emerging trends."
According to Hariharan the first five trends are: The rise of micro celebrities and influencers impacting marketing strategy, the rise of the emerging freelance economy and associated changes, commitment phobia with consumption choices affected due to aversion to commit to big ticket purchases, bespoke and customized experiences being favoured and brands needing to be quick & open to topical humour to engage with consumers.
Taking over from Hariharan, Chitrangani explained the next five trends. She said, "Working with consumers we see certain trends that emerge. These are: Age not the mark of maturity, the emergence of the global Sri Lankan, religion moving away to pragmatism, the rising importance of mental well-being and the rebirth of life in the 50s."
A vibrant interactive panel discussion presented the audience with further thoughts in understandingemerging trends in 2018.

Tourists safety, a priority
It was recently reported that the Tourism Minister is to go ahead with a Digital Advertising campaign in major generating markets spending millions of rupees of valuable foreign exchange. Throwing aside the objections of launching such a campaign by the stakeholders of the industry, the travel agents and hoteliers are the main sources which fund the Tourism Development Fund. The money in this fund will be utilized for this digital advertising campaign.
Before launching such an advertising campaign, the Minister should ensure the safety of visiting tourists. One often hears of how tourists are waylaid and robbed and in certain instances even raped. We also hear of how three-wheel drivers and even bus conductors overcharge unsuspecting tourists charging double and treble the fare.
Presenting half a dozen motorcycles to the tourist police will not solve the problem of providing security for the tourists. They are fleeced from the moment they land at the BIA in Katunayake.
The Prime Minister who heads the Tourism Advisory Council should insist that Sri Lanka should be recognized as a country where tourists are saved before spending millions of rupees on advertising in whatever format.

Neal de Alwis - LSSP MP was arrested in 1962: the Only DRAMA in aborted attempt
The coup that chose failure
Numerous responses and inquiries by Daily News readers prompted the writer to continue with one more episode of the failed Coup.
William Neal de Alwis was a senior member of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. Born on January 19, 1914, he received his education at All Saints College, Galle and St. Joseph's College, Colombo.
At the first parliamentary election held in 1947, he ran as the LSSP candidate in the Udugama electorate but failed to get elected. At the second parliamentary election, held in May 1952, he successfully contested Udugama defeating UNPs Goonesekera. He was unable to retain his seat at the April 1956 election where he lost to SLFP.
In March 1960, whilst he received less than 20% of the total vote, in a field of nine candidates, it was adequate enough for him to win the seat and re-enter parliament.
Officers of the Army and Police, on January 27, 1962, attempted a coup d tat intended at overthrowing the government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. [we discussed details on January 24 on this column] The government on receipt of information arrested the leaders of the mid-night operation by the evening of 27th, however, not before the only arrest of the coup drama occurred. Police arrested MP, de Alwis at his residence in Baddegama around 12.30 p.m. as part of the plan to take into custody all leading politicians of the day. He was detained until 11.00 a.m. the following day.
High drama in the House
Neal de Alwis, the LSSP MP, Baddegama, Galle district, speaking in the House of Representatives on February 23 stated, On Saturday, Jan. 27, [D-day] I had a conference in the Labour Department at which the superintendent of Tennehene Estate was present. Jesudasan, a suspect in the coup is a director at Carson Cumberbach, who were the agents for the estate. After the inquiry was over, this superintendent made a very significant remark. He said, Very soon, Mr Alwis, you all will be finished. What happened that night At about one oclock in the morning of January 28, police were sent to arrest me. There were about 25 police officers with rifles. The OIC Poddala station said I have to make a statement. I thought my statement was in connection with Trade Union activities.
The MP continuing said that the OIC explained the only reason for the arrest was instructions from his superior officer, V E Perera, the Superintendent of Police, Galle. The MP also stated that he surmised it was part of the governments plan to suppress the powerful left due to the national trade unions strike action, something that they were expecting to happen any moment.
The Inspectors called me to a side and said that they have ordered from the Superintendent of Police to bring me under detention orders. I told them that I was expecting this and that I had information that Trade Union leaders were to be arrested. By arresting us how can the government solve the problems I asked. I had a wash and asked the Inspector if I can take a suitcase with me. He said quite in order; then I put in a few things, I was asked to carry a few pillow cases too. Then I got into the police jeep and was taken to the Galle police station... I found Superintendent of Police, V. E. Perera his two assistants, ASPs Mahamood and Hofman waiting for me, SP Perera said, We are sorry, these are instructions, I said quite in orderIm not blaming you, people....
The MP for Baddegama also revealed very valuable information on involvement of Galle districts planters in the conspiracy, Mr de Alwis continuing his speech in Parliament, said,
I am also aware that Sydney de Zoysa was actively engaged with certain officers of Police stations who were also actively engaged with the Superintendents of these estates. In fact, in September 1961, I went and saw the IGP and DIG, L I de Silva. I told them that I suspected the activities of Assistant Superintendent of Police, who I understand is now on forced leave; that he was in league with the estate superintendents and Sydney [de Zoysa, coup leader]; and was actively engaged in the activities of the estates trade union movementin fact there was a superintendent in Talangaha Estate who had decided to engage Sydneys security service doing away with local police.
Describing the mid-night ordeal at the police station after his arrest, the Marxist/Trotskyite Parliamentarian stated,
In 10 or 15 minutes time, I got into the bed, as I thought I would be taken to Colombo next morning. The next day at about 9.30 in the morning, Hopman came to me and said he wanted to take a statement on my activities during the past three days while the statement was being recorded the telephone rang, he answered went out and came back and said,
Mr Alwis I have come to announce your release. Then on Monday 29, again the CID came to my residence and wanted to get a statement I said I have already made a statement to Hopman, but they insisted, this is on details of your arrest.
Then of course, it dawned on me that something really has happened. - Hansard- 23/02/62-columns: 2503/2505
Neal back in Parliament
In the absence of advanced sophisticated equipment that is available today; this was one rare instance of the breakdown in the otherwise meticulous communication network employed by the plotters.
At the 1970 parliamentary election, de Alwis was re-elected to Baddegama, with 22,126 votes. His party, the LSSP formed a political coalition, the United Front, with the SLFP and Communist Party which successfully won the 1970 parliamentary election. Neal de Alwis was appointed a Deputy Minister. At the 8th parliamentary election in July 1977, de Alwis switched to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party; however, he failed to get re-elected.

CWC to consult President on forming new councils
The Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) yesterday said the party will continue to support President Maithripala Sirisena as the CWC is still an ally of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance.
CWC Leader Arumugam Thondaman said he will meet President Maithripala Sirisena to discuss on how power can be shared in the councils won by his party in the upcountry today.
We have won 11 councils in the upcountry and many of them would be governed by ourselves, he said.
Thondaman added that some of the councils will be run with the support of the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP).We will strive to make the peoples expectations a reality by gaining control of several local government bodies with the support of the SLPP
There were only 40 members in the council and now it has increased to 130 to 150.We need to carry on with the support of the SLPP. We have informed the President about this, he said.
Thondaman further said that since the CWC is still with the UPFA, all final decisions will be taken after consulting the President. We were not in power for the past three years and as a result the people in the upcountry were in dispair. Now, we have got another opportunity to serve them and uplift their living standards while ensuring a better future for them," he said.
When asked about the prevailing turmoil within the national government, he said that they will continue to support President Maithripala Sirisena, no matter what.

D. B. Jayatilaka 150th birth anniversary commemorated
The commemoration of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Sir D. B. Jayatilaka was held yesterday at the Presidential Secretariat premises under the patronage of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
Addressing the occasion after paying floral tributes to the statue of Sir D. B. Jayatilake located at the Presidential Secretariat, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the commemoration of national heroes is essential to arouse positive emotions among the young generation.
He said the commemoration and paying tribute to the national leaders of the country seems to have been lost, especially among our young generation.
By organizing national events to commemorate great leaders and involving themselves, the young generation would increase their sense of attachment to the nation, said the Speaker.
The Mahanayake Thera of Kotte Sri Kalayani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha, Most Ven. Dr. Ittapana Dhammalankara Thera delivered an anusasana on the occasion.
Family members of Sir D. B. Jayatilake, Secretary to the President Austin Fernando, Western Province Governor K. C. Logeshwaran, Treasury Secretary R. S. H. Samaratunga, IGP Pujith Jayasundara and other guests participated.
Sir Don Baron Jayatilaka was born on February 13, 1868, in Waragoda, a village in Kelaniya. He was the eldest son of Don Daniel and Elisa Jayatilaka, the former hailing from Pattalagedara in Veyangoda.
Sir D.B. had his initial education at Vidyalankara Pirivena where he learnt Sinhalese, Pali, Sanscrit and Buddhist literature under the patronage of scholars such as Ven. Rathmalane Sri Dharmaloka. His elementary education in the English medium commenced at a Baptist school in Kelaniya and he received his secondary education at Wesley College, Colombo.
His marriage to Mallika Batuwanthudawa, daughter of Pandith Batuwantudawa of Warahena, Bentota took place in 1898 and they had five children, three daughters and two sons.
He graduated from the University of Calcutta with a BA in 1896 and went on to gain a BA in jurisprudence from Jesus College, Oxford in 1913 which was later upgraded to a MA some years later.
He was called to the bar as a Barrister from the Lincoln's Inn and became an Advocate of the Supreme Court of Ceylon.
He first met Colonel Henry Steel Olcott in 1890 and joined his campaign to establish English medium Buddhist schools in the country. In 1898, he was appointed as the first Principal of Dharmaraja College, Kandy. Thereafter, he became the Vice Principal of Ananda College, Colombo.
He was the founder of the Young Men's Buddhist Association (YMBA) at Borella.
Sir D. B. Jayatilaka was elected President of the Ceylon National Congress in 1923 and then he was elected from the Colombo District to the Legislative Council of Ceylon and was elected as its Vice-President after the demise of Sir James Peiris in 1930. Following the constitutional reforms of the Donoughmore Commission, Jayatilaka was elected to the newly formed State Council of Ceylon and became Leader of the House and Minister for Home Affairs.
He died on May 29, 1944 due to a heart attack in Bangalore.

Drying Fish: A Woman's World
Along the countrys Southern coast, stalls selling dried fish are as common a sight as palm trees and thambili and the ocean itself. Manning these stalls are male vendors who hawk the processed and preserved seer, tuna, and spratsstaples of the Sri Lankan dietto passersby.
But beneath the surface, this industry is held up not by men but by womenmothers and daughters and wives and widows. In the seaside village of Kudawella, Hambantota district, these women comprise an estimated ninety to ninety-five percent of the trade. They work not commercially but as part of an intergenerational cottage industry, clusters of women drying fish by hand in the front and back yards of each others homes.
Without these women, the dried fish industry would cease to function as it currently does. The women fuel the industry, the industry fuels the countrybut who, or what, is fueling the women And do they get as much from working in dried fish as they give
A day in the life
For the women of Kudawella, days ideally begin early in the morning, when fish by the hundred and sometimes thousand are delivered to their homes by local fishermen in the backs of their small lorries. Working in groups that range from two to six people, depending on the size of the delivery, the women unload the fish and lay them out on tarps outside. Then they get to work.
What follows can vary depending on the type of dried fish being produced. For the traditional dried style, this involves a meticulous routine of cleaning, gutting, boiling, salting, and laying out the fish to dry. For the Maldivian style, the fish are also smoked.
The work is tough and laborious. The women are required to be on their feet all day, or hunched over buckets. When smoking the fish, they are forced to watch the fire for hours on enddespite the heat, despite the flames ending up in their eyes. And without enough and adequate equipment, the work takes even longer.
But even accounting for the arduous physical labor it entails, a typical day in dried fish production is hardly so simple, and near impossible to approximate. This is because the industry is affected by so many variables that are beyond the control of the women who allow it to function.
No set hours
To start, there are no set working hours. Once the fish arrive, the women have a limited amount of time to complete the drying process, which acts as a natural preservative. If they take too long to tend to the fish without properly refrigerating or cooling themtechnology which the dried fish cottage industry, for the most part, lacksthe fish spoil and rot. So the women work non-stop, from the time the fish are delivered until the time the drying is complete.
If were lucky, they bring the fish in the morning and we work until eight or nine in the night to finish, said D. V. Sunita, a 42-year-old producer of Maldive fish.

She explained that based on the amount of fish delivered that day, she and the five other women working alongside her expected to have all the fish laid flat or hung on metal racks, ready to bake in the sun for the next few days, within twelve or so hours.
On some days, the women arent as lucky. V. M. Anulawati, aged 33, lives on Sunitas street and is one of the women who work with her. She said there were days when fish had been delivered by 9.00 am but the drying process wasnt completed until the following morning. When this happens, the women are forced to stay up all night.
Ramini Hettige, a 52-year-old producer of traditional tried fish, said much the same. I have to work until the fish is hung and dry. I have no choice.
Weather permitting
Extended unseasonal rainfall can be detrimental to the dried fish cottage industry which, absent any electric heating or dehydrating technology, relies on sunlight to preserve the fish. Such rainfall can put the women who rely on this work out of business for weeks or months on end.
It is very hard for us to do this work when it rains, said Hettige, speaking to us while hunched over a bucket, snapping the heads of and then gutting one fish after another. She added that many a fish have gone to waste when rain showers start while she is still in the process of drying them.
Even if it rains once I finish but before the fish have been in the sun for two or three days, they will be ruined.
Detrimental costs
Weather is not the only variable that puts a damper on the dried fish industry. If fish are scarce, and therefore priced higher than usual, drying them becomes untenable.
We work only on the days we can afford to, said Sunita.
In the past months, we had very little work. There was a shortage of fish and the prices were very high. Only recently, we started to work again.
Sunitas husband, Anura Muthungala, said that the average price of the fish they purchase to drybalaya and alagoduwa, two types of tunais Rs. 120 per kilogram. To make one kilogram of Maldive fish, six kilograms of fresh fish are needed, which means it costs Rs. 720 to make one kilogram of dried Maldive fish.
On the market, the Maldive fish are sold by size: the price of a small dried fish is Rs. 750 - 800 per kilogram, the price of a medium dried fish is Rs. 1,050 per kilogram, and the price of a large dried fish is Rs. 1,050  1,200 per kilogram. This means Sunitas dried fish accrues, on average, a profit of around Rs. 250 per kilogram. Yet this doesnt account for any of the expenses she and her coworkers must pay: for firewood, for salt, for transport, and for equipment.
When fish prices are in fluxbetween the third and fourth week of December, for instance, the price of balaya jumped 64 percentdrying it is no longer cost-effective, and as such production stalls.
Hettige was also affected by the recent peak in fish prices.
We faced financial difficulties in the past few months, she said. Her husband is paralyzed, so their daughter and two granddaughters rely on Hettiges income to make ends meet; lately, she said, she makes just Rs. 50 in profit per kilogram of dried fish sold.
Competing against imported fish
In November of 2017, in an attempt to give relief to consumers hit by recurring droughts and floods in the preceding months, the government slashed import taxes on several food items. On dried fish, the tax was nearly halved, from Rs. 102 to Rs. 52, and implemented immediately.
Predictably, this caused an upswing in the importation of both types of dried fish. According to data from the Ministry of Fisheries, from 2016 to 2017 there was a 2.4 percent increase in the imported quantity of dried fish and a 5.3 percent increase in the imported quantity of Maldive fish.
For the women working in the dried fish industry with whom we spoke, this is not a good thing. Every one of them lamented about the tax cut and subsequent importing increase.
We need to limit the importing of dried fish to increase the demand for locally-produced fish, said Sunita. We are losing our market to sell local dried fish.
D. V. Sagarika, age 40, is a widow who works with Sunita. Her husband died by suicide eight years ago, leaving her to care for their three children alone. She said that the government easing the import of dried fish from abroad only adds to the problems that women working in the dried fish cottage industry already face.
From the moment we get the fish delivered, we cant keep it raw for a long time. We have to complete the whole process within a few days. So we expect and need the government to help us have a market to sell our products, she said.
We live on an island surrounded by sea, but we still import dried fish from other countries. I see it as a huge loss for the country.
Advisor to the Ministry of Fisheries Claude Fernando said in an interview that no measures will be taken by the government to reduce or stop the import of dried fish to Sri Lanka, adding that it is supply-and-demand driven.
In need of help, but ignored
Fernando insisted that there are gender-specific organizations working with the social development sector of the Ministry to help women engaged in the industry, specifically by providing them technical assistance. He also said the Ministry has decided to provide them grants for improvement.
But Fernando wouldnt specify which womens organizations are involved in these efforts, nor would he identify the grants or explain how they would be doled out.
The women in Kudawella, for their part, feel abandoned by the government. They say theyve reached out to both their provincial MPs and the Fisheries Ministry but have received no appropriate response.
They are all the same, said Sunita. None of them have done anything. And if they answer now, its only because of the [upcoming local government] elections.
What the women of Kudawella want is simple: some help. They are not looking for handouts; they like working, despite the strain drying fish places on them. They joke of being unable to remember a time they didn't smell of the sea, and say the scent is now part of them. But theyre hoping that the government can ease some of the burden they currently carrythrough providing the women with bare minimal equipment, adjusting the import tax scheme, or helping them secure a profitable share of the market.
Until then, the women of Kudawella will keep working, holding up the dried fish industry like they have for so many decades.
As Sunita said, It might seem like I have problems. And I do. But when I dont work, that is when its most difficult. That is the worst kind of problem.

Fair hand for fair justice
When women are in government, the benefits are boundless: corruption lessens, the economy improves, and governance itself is more efficient. One would think such positive results would mean female participation in politics would be high, and ever-increasing. Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka, like elsewhere, this is hardly the case.
Since 1931, Sri Lankan women have had the right to vote. And yet in the 86 years since, female participation in Parliament has never surpassed 6 percent. Worse, female participation in local government hovers around a measly 2 percent and just 4 percent in provincial government. All this despite the fact that the country has had female Heads of State, either in the Presidency or as Prime Minister, for 25 of the 61 years since independence.
This situation was brought to the fore two weeks ago, at a panel discussion on July 26 on how to operationalize the 25 percent quota for women in local government that was passed in 2016. Held at the Lighthouse at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute, the panel discussion sought to compare the experiences of women politicians from different countries, namely Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom, and Pakistan, on advancing womens political participation. It was sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD), the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
Problematic Status Quo
UN Resident Coordinator for Sri Lanka Una McCauley said the present situation in Sri Lanka is dire. Giving an introductory speech at the event, she emphasized that Sri Lanka ranked last of all South Asian countries when it comes to female representation in politics.
This is not acceptable in a country where the majority of people are women, McCauley said.
Still, McCauley said she remained optimistic, largely due to the mandatory 25 percent quota, yet to be operationalized, passed as the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act No. 1 of 2016.
I see the representatives of the future of the people of Sri Lanka, and I say people because as women, we dont just represent ourselves but represent everybody.
She concluded her speech by saying, I look forward to working with far more women leaders at the local level in 2018.
The panel moderator, Kumudini Samuel of the Sri Lankan Women and Media Collective, emphasized that the time for action is now.
This is a very critical moment in Sri Lanka's history because we have a mandatory quota that was legislated for, she said. We have a situation [in this country] where women have been particularly discriminated against. Womens participation in local government hovers around 2 percent. But this is the first time in our history that we have a mandatory, legally binding quota, and we must be sure to enact it.
Throughout the succeeding discussion, many suggestions were brought up by the panel members and the audience in response to how female representation in politics could improve, and specifically how to operationalize the quota.
The panel consisted of Nan Sloane, a former United Kingdom Local Government Councillor with the Labour Party; Claire Haughey, an MP in the Scottish Parliament with the Scottish National Party; Amra Khan, an MP in the Pakistani Parliament with the Womens Parliamentary Caucus of Pakistan; Hannah David, National Director of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom and head of the Conservative Party Policy Forum; and Dr. Sudarshini Fernandopulle, the State Minister of City Planning and Water Supply, Member of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Women and Gender, and Member of the Womens Parliamentary Caucus.
Potential solutions
Nan Sloane, a member of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom up first, explained how her party increased its representation of women in government at the local level specifically. She said that her party did this by practicing a sort of gender affirmative action at the local level, going to great lengths to nominate women as well as ensuring that when women were nominated as candidates, it was for elections that were winnable.
We needed to put female candidates up for races that they could be elected in, so that we were actually changing the makeup of local government and not just the makeup of candidates for local government.
Still, she explained, there are issues that bar women from pursuing politics in the first place that quotas and affirmative action alone cannot address.
Quotas are rarely sufficient to get you to where you need to be, Sloane said. You need to back that up with support for women candidates, not just with training but with support for navigating what might be a very unfamiliar environment because politics is not a familiar environment for most women. It can be, even at the local level, quite intimidating and it can be quite a difficult environment. Many women love it. Some women find it difficult. And there needs to be some support for those women.
Claire Haughey, the member of Scottish Parliament who spoke next, discussed her partys approach to a more egalitarian gender balance in Parliament. She explained that while the Scottish National Party made efforts, like the Labour Party, to put women up for elections which they could win, the attempts at gender parity went beyond elected officials.
They started with party officers at the branch level.
Each branch of the party is required to have a womens officer, the same way each branch might have a secretary or treasurer. In this way, womens issues and representation is seen to be as pressing as, for example, financial ones.
Haughey said the Scottish National Party also have at least one womens conference per year and have set up a womens academy, to train women who are interested not just in running in an election but in becoming more active in politics in their own communities.
Finally, she explained the SNPs form of affirmative action: if an incumbent was stepping down, the party would put forward a women-only shortlist for candidates to take the incumbent's place. As a result of all these initiatives, the Scottish National Party currently has 42% female representation.
Hannah David, the representative from the UK conservative party, similarly stressed the role of party-wide conferences and initiatives to make politics a more welcoming space for women. She referenced that she herself was involved through a womens organization run by Teresa May which ensures that women can stand up against men for elections.
And Amra Khan, an MP from Pakistani, rounded out the conversation by bringing the emphasis back to quotas and their import.
Quotas are imperative for ensuring equality in societies, Khan said.
Quota must stay at 25 percent
The last member of the panel to speak was Dr. Sudarshini Fernandopulle, State Minister of City Planning and Water Supply and member of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Women and Gender and the Womens Parliamentarians Caucus. She spoke on the need for Sri Lankan women to tackle the problematic status quo.
Women here think there might be no problem, but compared to the rest of the world and even to South Asia, we are very much lagging behind. When the audience was given time to question the panel members, some expressed concerns that the situation wouldnt be improved, namely because there are considerations to reduce the quota to make it more attainable.
I urge the chairperson not to let the quota drop to 10 percent, one female audience member who said she was considering running for local office said to Dr. Fernandopulle. Dr. Fernandopulle said she agreed that the quota could not drop, as did the other panelists.
And throughout the panel discussion, all the representatives dismissed arguments commonly used to explain away the lack of female representation in politics.
Some people say there arent enough women to fill the seats [required of the quota], said Nan Sloane. But I think there are enough women. If women arent taking up the offer to run for office, then we need to think about changing the nature of the offer. Something is wrong with it.

Forbidden sanctuary of the royals
The lush forest cover behind Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy has a long history dating back to many centuries. It was declared Thahansikele or forbidden forest by the Sinhala kings who ascended the throne when Kandy became the capital city.
It was a royal forest reserve where no one was allowed to venture, located close to Sri Dalada Maligawa and the Royal Palace. In this verdant jungle where among trees, creepers, lichen, mosses, ferns, grasses, fungi and bacteria are found in abundance. The forest remained impenetrable for over many centuries where wild boar, monkey, hare, squirrel, scaly, anteater, porcupine, and reptiles, monitor lizard, tortoise and varieties of birds, worms and insects live in perfect harmony with nature.
Heavy foliage
The pond in the heart of the jungle was the place where queens in the past bathed and used as their garden. At times of war, kings always used the forest cover for their defense against attacks and very often they escaped through the heavy foliage to a safer place in the hills. In the past elephant, elk and leopard roamed freely among tall giant trees and hanging creepers. The leaves that fell from trees and creepers on the ground keep the surface moist after intermittent showers. Throughout history the atmosphere around Udawttakale evoked a certain feeling of mysterious nature. The noise of cicadas makes the mystery deeper creating reverence and awe.
The Asgiri upatha the historical record describes how Udawattakele become a forest reserve when the ancient village, Senkadagala was chosen as one of the early settlements in the country. According to this historical record the first settlement was founded during the rule of king Gajabahu of Anuradhapura (114-136AC).There is reference to the Maha Thera Palabathgala Wanarathana of the lineage of Dimbulagala Dipankara Thero who brought four other bhikshus to Senkadagala during to the rule of King Panditha Parakramabahu of Kurunegala.
However, King Wickremabahu of Gampola is populary believed to be the founder of the city of Senkadagala who built his palace on a site carved out of Udawattekele. It is for this reason that the name Udawasalawatta was called, and it is now called Udawattakele.
Unbelievably impregnable
Udawattakele was the watershed for streams that fed the Natha Devala paddy fields, which was later made in to the present Kandy Lake. There where streams of water that flow down event to this day from Udawattakele. This forest possesses since beauty of Kandy town says Nihal Karunartne in his account given in his text Udawattakele. John Still has described Udawattakele. This forest is a very wet one and consequently very dense and much of it is bound in to and unbelievably impregnable tangle by creeping bamboo washed the long tendrils hard and then has telegraph wire from a mesh difficult for men to enter unless he can cut his way painfully yard by yard.
Many writers have described the view from Udawattakele in a glowing manner. This picturesque setting with its thick foliage had stirred their imagination to describe at length when one of them said. The early morning dew glistens like a million jets as the rays of the son brake though the trees.
When the morning mist gently clears from the placid water of the pond in the middle of the forest glee, the shrill call of the bird from the near by tree or a croak of the frog my disturb the stillness of the surroundings.
Panorama peace
One can notice a monitor lizard sim lazily catching a glimpse of a ley in the water, disturbed by its movement a blue kingfisher flashes cross with its widespread wings hen it failed to catch a fish. With this panorama peace and tranquility continue to prevail throughout this panoramic kingdom of fauna and flora. Udawattakele is the only forest in the world found bordering a city. With the expansion of the city it has been reduced to the present size. The change taking place out side continues to effect the serenity and charm of the forest while it continues to remain as a forbidden forest Thahanchikele.

Government earnings from cigarettes see drop in 2017
Government tax earnings from cigarette sales are likely to see a reduction in 2017 for the first time in five years. According to provisional data, the government earned Rs 86 billion from tobacco excise in 2017 compared to Rs 88.7 billion in 2016, a drop of Rs. 2.7 billion.
In 2016, the tax revenue from tobacco grew 12.46 percent year-on-year and government excise earnings from tobacco alone was Rs 88.7 billion, a drastic increase from Rs 57 billion in 2014.
Sri Lankas monopoly cigarette manufacturer, Ceylon Tobacco Company PLC attributes 2017s 3.10 percent reduction in government tax revenue to the significant increase in the price of sticks in Q4 2016. The unprecedented 40 percent price increase resulted in a huge drop in sales volumes. Unfortunately, most of this volume drop was filled by smuggled cigarettes which are estimated at 500 million sticks in 2017.

DOHA: Beaten Australian Open finalist Simona Halep said Tuesday she enjoyed everything that happened in Melbourne despite being left in tears at losing the chance of her first Grand Slam title.
Everything was beautiful at that tournament even if I lost the final, the Romanian said at a press conference in Doha as she arrived to play in this weeks Qatar Open.
I took only the positives and Im really motivated to go ahead. So everything was really good for me. Halep was defeated in a memorable and gruelling three-set final by Caroline Wozniacki in Melbourne last month, which also meant she lost her world number one ranking to the Dane.
Previously, she admitted the loss, her third Grand Slam final defeat, had left her in tears.
Doha represents Haleps first return to competitive action since Australia as she has been nursing an ankle injury. The injury forced her out of Romanias Fed Cup tie with Canada last weekend.
Halep has the possibility of reclaiming the worlds top ranking this week if she reaches at least the quarter-finals and goes one round further than Wozniacki.

Harvard economist bashes SL import tariffs
In order to increase exports, the Sri Lankan government must reform its import tariffs, Harvard economist Robert Lawrence said Thursday.
Tariffs are the wrong way to raise revenue, he said, addressing an audience at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute. Lawrence is the Faculty Chair of the Practice of Trade Policy Executive Program at the Harvard Kennedy School.
He said misplaced protectionist policies had hurt Sri Lankas economy.
The decline of exports as a percentage of GDP since the early 2000s, he argued, correlates with the increase of import tariffs. Professor Lawrence said he could discern no rationale in the implementation of tariffs over the years, and it seemed to him that they are more accurately a history of who had political influence than they are of who is a great economic strategist.
He said Sri Lanka should instead move towards a simpler tariff structure, and implement direct taxes on things like income and property to maintain revenue. 90 percent of your tariffs should be in the simple schedule, and then there may be some exceptions, he said noting that those exceptions should be for firms that actually had long-run growth potential.
I think an outward orientation is very critical, he said. Also, its hard to judge what you really are competitive in, and what you really could add value in, when you are putting these penalties on your firms by giving them costly inputs.
He cited the example of the booming air conditioning manufacturing industry in South Africa, which developed domestically as a response to hot conditions in gold mines.
Sri Lanka needs to create an environment that rewards investment, he said. And then let a thousand flowers bloom.

Strong top line performances across the Hayleys Group and the addition of recent strategic acquisitions resulted in a 37% YoY increase in turnover up to Rs. 112.3 billion during the nine months to December 31, 2017 while gross profits expanded by 29% YoY up to Rs. 24 billion.
Increases in raw material prices and adverse weather conditions impacted the operating profits of Groups manufacturing and agriculture sectors while the higher borrowing costs resulting from the Groups progressive investment strategy coupled with higher interest rates prevalent during the period in review contracted the groups profit before Tax (PBT) to Rs. 2.94 billion.
It has been a challenging nine months for the Hayleys Group despite the remarkable growth and expansion displayed in the top line performances of all of our diverse business segments. Our continued growth drive, which we have strategically embarked upon, has reflected in an increase in the finance cost reported for the period.
Although the higher finance costs have had a negative impact on group profits during the period, measures are already being implemented to realign the financial position in order to bolster profitability and recover momentum moving into the final quarter of the financial year, which is traditionally the strongest performing quarter for the group. Coupled with exponential gains from the investments entered into over the past year, we anticipate a strong growth outlook for the group moving forward, Hayleys PLC Chairman and Chief Executive, Mohan Pandithage stated.
Meanwhile, the groups consumer products segment, which also includes the recently acquired business of Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC recorded a significant improvement in turnover, which stood at Rs. 19.9 billion as compared with a previous Rs 3.86 billion while profits in the segment rose from Rs. 90.18 million up to Rs. 965.7 million.

HUAWEI rises to 25th spot on  Brand Finance Global 500
Brand Finance, the global authoritative consulting agency, released its ranking of the most valuable brands around the world in 2018. HUAWEI ranked twenty-fifth on Brand Finance Global 500 2018 with a value of 38.046 billion dollars, and its brand value increased by more than 50%.
Brand Finance, as the world famous brand value and strategy consulting firm, will assess the thousands of well-known global brands every year.
It is one of the most credible global brand value evaluation agencies and its strict selection criteria includes not only Brand Strength Index (BSI), but also Brand Loyalty and Marketing Investment, etc.
The annual announcement of Brand Finance can always bring heated debate, because the international companies who enter the list not only mean strong comprehensive strength, but also show that their brand value has been internationally recognized.
HUAWEIS rank has increased from 47th in 2016, 40th in 2017 and made a huge leap as the 25th ranked brand on Brand Finance Global 500 2018.
In addition to advancing year by year in the list released by Brand Finance, HUAWEI also appeared on the BrandZ Top 100 Brands and Interbrand's Best 100 Brands.

Iraqs girl weightlifters also boost family finances
BAGHDAD, Monday: The weightlifters on Iraqs national womens team train hard every day, both to bring home the medals and to help ease the financial burden of running a home.
Jerking weights heavier than themselves at a rundown gym in Baghdads conservative Shiite neighbourhood of Sadr City, the young women and girls come together for three hours every day.
The girls are focused as they work out between the small gyms peeling pale mint walls, one of which is adorned with a giant painted Iraqi flag.
With their dark hair in high buns and dressed in team green tracksuit tops, black shorts and leggings, they raise an arm and turn from side to side to warm up.
Then they work out hanging from a pull-up bar, before moving to different mats to get down to the business of lifting weights.
To those who say weightlifting is not for girls, I say we can do everything men do, says Huda Salim al-Saedi, 20, patting chalk powder from her hands.
I challenge men to lift weights and Im proud of it, says the weightlifter, her eyebrows trimmed neatly and a black bandana keeping her hair from falling in her face.
Huda was one of the first to be recruited when coach Abbas Ahmed in 2011 set out to create Iraqs first national female weightlifting team.
At first, it was an uphill battle.
It was very, very hard, says the former mens coach, who is now 54.
Society rejected the idea, with conservatives considering the sport inappropriate for women and girls.
There was also no state funding for the project.
So Ahmed first approached families whose members were already fans of the sport.
Huda seemed like an ideal candidate. She had practised Taekwondo since the age of eight and had long been a fan of weightlifting on television.
Today, shes a cornerstone of the Iraqi womens team and its most promising member.
Huda helped to train her sister Hadeel, who just turned 17, and last year both of them competed in Asian championships.
The 20-year-old won bronze in the snatch discipline in her category at the Asian Championships in Turkmenistan, lifting 90 kilos in one swift motion above her head. She finished first overall at the Asian Junior Championship in Nepal.
Her younger sister Hadeel also competed there taking 10th place lifting 68 kilos in the snatch, while in another competition in Kathmandu, the Asian Youth Championships, she came in fourth overall.
But beyond making their relatives proud, Huda and Hadeels accomplishments have also provided their family with some financial security.
Thanks to weightlifting, I have a salary and money to cover my familys needs every month, Huda says, with her sisters pay cheque also helping make ends meet. - AFP

Island tax haven  firms own 23,000  UK properties
A quarter of property in England and Wales owned by overseas firms is held by entities registered in the British Virgin Islands, BBC analysis has found.
The Caribbean archipelago is the official home of companies that own 23,000 properties - more than any other country.
They are owned by 11,700 firms registered in the overseas territory.
The finding emerged from BBC analysis conducted of Land Registry data on overseas property ownership.
The research found there are around 97,000 properties in England and Wales held by overseas firms, as of January 2018.
It adds to concerns that companies registered in British-controlled tax havens have been used to avoid tax.
Close behind the British Virgin Islands (BVI), which has a population of just 30,600, are Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.
Of the properties owned by overseas companies in England and Wales, two thirds are registered to firms in the British Virgin Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.
Many foreign UK property owners are also officially headquartered in Hong Kong, Panama and Ireland.
The analysis provides a new picture of ownership of property by overseas companies in England and Wales following a decision last November to make the database public and free to access.
It found: Close to half (44%) of all properties owned by overseas companies in England and Wales are located in London, More than one in ten (11,500) properties owned by overseas companies in England and Wales are located in the City of Westminster, More than 6,000 properties owned by foreign companies are in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea.
The government of the British Virgin Islands said it was incorrect to label the country as a tax haven.
It said that there were many practical reasons why UK properties might be owned by companies incorporated in the BVI.
It argued that BVI companies can bring together multiple investors and owners, which is useful for big commercial property deals that have investors in more than one country.
The BVI also said that it shared "necessary information" including ownership details with relevant authorities.
Among those entries in the database that disclosed a price, the most expensive was the former headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, New Scotland Yard, at 8-10 Broadway.
The site was purchased by the Abu Dhabi Financial Group in 2014 for 370m from the Mayor of London's office. But it is officially owned by a Jersey-based company called BL Development.
The 1967 multi-storey block has now been demolished to make way for "a luxury collection of one to five bedroom apartments across six architecturally striking towers". These range in price from 1.5m to more than 10m.

Leader by  example
A good leader is someone who inspires people to work towards better goals that make a positive change in the community. So believes Saanya Subasinghe, Head Girl of The British School in Colombo, a goal oriented individual who understands the importance of working together. Perfect Prefect presents Saanya Subasinghe, a positive young woman with a voice to be reckoned with.
A good leader is someone who inspires a positive change and motivates people towards achieving better goals but a good leader does not act alone. A good leader is someone with a good support system who hears everyone and then inspires movement towards the shared goal of the community said Subasinghe.
A Voice for the Community
Saanya Subasinghe is in her final year at The British School Colombo. She plans to attend Colombia University, a private Ivy League research universityin August. With a family background centered in Business Studies and Management, it was a great surprise when she decided instead to focus on Economics and Political Sciences.
I know its an unusual combination but I am interested in being a voice for the community. With a family that focuses on business studies, they naturally expected that I would go into the same thing. But I want to make a change and impact the future differently, said Subasinghe.
One of her strengths is public speaking which proved most beneficial when she participated in Model United Nations (MUN), specifically in Colombo Model United Nations (COMUN) and this helped fuel her preference for political science. She also has a passion towards working for others which translates into her hopes of being a voice for the voiceless.
Inspired by Obama
While she will be attending the same university as former President of the United States Barack Obama, who also majored in political science at Colombia University in New York City, it is Michelle Obama for whom she has the utmost respect.
Michelle Obama took the title of First Lady of the United States and made it her own. The amount of work she has done for Womens Rights including the Let Girls Learn initiative is truly inspiring. I believe that she is the perfect example of a good leader, said Subasinghe.
Subasinghe too is an advocate for womens empowerment in her own way. She was recently selected for the Centennial Anniversary 2018 International Convention of Zonta International which is to be held in Japan. She was selected out of ten to speak at the event as she was one of the ten International YWPA (Young Women in Public Affairs) Award winners for the previous year.
Feminism is for Equality. It is the empowerment of women to achieve equality but joint effort is needed to achieve it, said Subasinghe.
The Face of a Team
To Subasinghe, the role of a Head Prefect is more of an official role. She and her co-Head Prefect, Darren Hall function as figureheads  a face of a team. There are two teams of prefects, the juniors and the seniors. The teams consist of Grade 12s and 13s respectively. The Head Prefects themselves are from Grade 13. First working with their peers in Grade 13 and then the new prefects from Grade 12 is quite a challenging transition. However like all good leaders they have a support system to back them up in the form of the Grade 13 seniors who help mentor the Grade 12s.
Its easy to work with Darren. Were used to working together first as House Captains last year, when we became House Champions at Inter House Athletics and now as Head Prefects. We co-ordinate well and I know hes always ready to back me up said Subasinghe speaking about her co-Head Prefect, Darren Hall.
Their duties as Head Prefects include monitoring the canteens during intervals to ensure that discipline is maintained and checking that uniforms meet the requirements of the school rules. They keep order during assemblies with the help of the prefects from the junior school. They are required to attend all school functions and even host certain school events.
Its all about the teamwork and sharing of thoughts and ideas. All ideas and opinions that are voiced in prefects meetings are taken into account. All alternative options are considered before arriving at a conclusion. The teachers too are a great source of strength as they offer advice whenever necessary.
We are Family!
Subasinghe considers The British School of Colombo to be a tightly knit community that conveys a family feeling. Based on unity and respect, they are interwoven to form an integrated web of togetherness in whatever arena be it sports, extra-curricular activities, singing, dancing or whatever else.
Bullying is discouraged as much as possible. However in the event that such an issue occurs, there are touch points for each grade that can be approached and these persons find ways to remedy the situation.
In most situations, it is the same kind of people that are behind the bullying. The situation is handled effectively and as immediately as possible by talking to the bullies and in a worse situation, their parents. We are a family and families respect each other said Subasinghe.
The Big No!
While bullying is handled with some level of leniency, there is one issue that receives a big no from the school and this is the abuse of drugs and alcohol. Unfortunately, in The British School of Colombo recently such a concern had been brought to light as a group of students from Grade 10 had been found in the possession of drugs. This was handled promptly by the school authorities and the parties involved had been expelled.
Contrary to the norm, it was the Year 10s that were involved in this issue. The senior school includes students from Year 7 to 13 so as the grade that is securely in the middle of the senior school, the Year 10s were in an influential position. Ultimately it was the seniors that acted as a source of strength, helping the juniors and advising them. Drug abuse is a big no and I feel that the right decision was made regarding the parties involved said Subasinghe.
Come back and give back!
Saanya Subasinghe considers her father to be her biggest inspiration. His ability to transform a room and motivate people to be driven towards achieving a goal or vision is one of his greatest qualities.
My dad was always busy travelling and yet he always somehow managed to keep us all together. He taught us important values and inspired us to always give back to our loved ones and our country. His unselfish nature, generosity and kindness are understated said Subasinghe as her love for her father shone evidently on her smiling face.
Having built is own business, he inspired her to passionately chase her dreams and cultivated a sense of patriotism in her as well. No matter where life takes her, she is motivated to come back to Sri Lanka and give back to her motherland.
Never Give Up!
Subasinghe is one who follows her passion and never gives up. She understands that everybody makes mistakes and that what is important is learning from these mistakes. She believes in following her heart.
People are always going to tell you that youre doing it wrong and thats okay. Listen to them and be aware of the possible alternatives. Be open-minded but know that the truth is always in your heart. So trust yourself and follow your heart summed up Subasinghe.

Marilyn Monroe  and Arthur Miller:  a love story
Though not strictly defined or conceptually interpreted in any conventional form, the genre known as autobiography is a self expression of a lifetimes experiences and encounters. Similar forms are known popularly as portrayals, profiles and biographies and autobiography takes the form of either a chronicle or a narrative pattern. The autobiography of the well known playwright and creative writer Arthur Miller (1915 - 2005), though a bulky volume running to 814 pages, is one of the most unputdownable autobiographies I read over the years.
Titled as Timebends, the work is segmented into eight long episodes, which are linked to each other by the narrator with readable situations packed with encounters with persons in the literary world, politics as well as in the film and theatre scene underlying sensitive portrayals of events and trends.
Ibsenite ideology
As far as possible, he tries to unveil some of the so far unstated episodes linked to the creative process of some of the well known plays like All My Sons, A View from the Bridge, The Crucible, Death of a Salesman and the well known novel Misfits which was transformed into a cinework with his wife Marilyn Monroe. It was Arthur Miller who adapted Henrik Ibsens An Anemey of the People, which too created a certain degree of a stir when original Ibsenite ideology was twisted by editing the last two acts into a single episode.
This was the Millerian expression given to Ibsens celebrated work, which I had the chance of translating and producing for the undergraduates at the University of Kelaniya.
The autobiography does not underline a special seat of learning from which he acquired the creative and literary spirit. Instead, the reader feels that from the schooling days, he had been attracted by the various types of literary groups and libraries. He notes that the human encounters of varying types had paved the way for him to be a playwright and a screenplay writer. He had had been sensitively inspired by his mother who had more creative plans and the grandfather who had been fond of storytelling.
From his young days, Miller had been a keen observer on social matters such as war, violence, social discrimination and racial issues. The two places that he had most frequented happen to be Harlem and Brooklyn. He had sensitively observed the exodus of Jews from the terror of Nazism and the emergence of the World War I. Then comes the social discrimination of Blacks. All these inclusive of slavery has resulted in his creation of such plays as Crucible and Incident at Vichy, both envelop the racial issues which had had a tremendous impact on the political ideology in the US as well as the UK.
Marilyn- Millar legend
Some of the incidents as recorded by Miller depicts that he had been victimised by the social order in which he lived. He had once fearlessly faced a trial on such matters. He looks more independent-minded.
Though quite a lot of information is given in popular press as regards the Marilyn Miller romance, Miller, the creative writer of his own experiences lay bare the human side of the marriage and divorce. Perhaps not discolouring the image of Marilyn. As a reader, I felt the sensitivity of Miller in the creation of the two works, The Misfits and After the Fall a play that envelops the Marilyn- Millar legend, where the inner layer of expression is the most vibrant verve of expression. Miller is more prophetic and visionary in his outlook on matters such as marriage and morals.
As a reader, I was moved by the following lines:
Glamour is a youth form of blindness that lets in light incoherent colour, but nothing defined. Like the rainbow, it is a once-uplifting vision that moves away the closer you come to it.
At one point Miller says that: One learns very early that books had to be respected, they were all putative Bibles and to some small degree had a share in holiness. There had been lessons that he had learned in the process of reading books. So he states: When I laid an open book face down, my brother would reprimand me, like a person, a book had a spine that could be broken.
Lively moments
Miller in his early childhood had been inspired by the works of Dickens, which had come to this house via the childrens encyclopaedia known to the world as Book of Knowledge. As the reader goes on knowing more and more about the wide range of experiences, his encounters of with contemporaries emerge as lively moments.
They include celebrities such as Bertolt Brecht, Tennessee Williams, Fernando Arrable, James Baldwin, Harold Pinter, Saul Bellow, Elia Kaan and Laurence Olivier. He had been instrumental in the promotion and foundation of the international PEN, a branch of which was forme din Sri Lanka too by the pioneer effort on the part of late Professor Ediriweera Sarachchandra, I am not too sure whether PEN (meant for the right of Publishers, Editors and Novelists) still exists.
Timebends a Life for the reader ought to give the feelings that it is not a mere autobiography, but a chronicle of our time written in with an open mind and with a meditative mood. The 90 years of his life spent in the world of arts is an epitome of inspiration.

MR heads JO Committee  to monitor present situation
The Joint Opposition (JO) says it has appointed a Committee headed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to take political decisions considering the situation in the country.
Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Ranjith de Zoysa said that the decision was reached during a members meeting held yesterday.
He also said that during the meeting, a Committee was also headed by former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa was set up to appoint Chairmen and Deputies of Local Government institutions won by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).

MR, seeing the wood for the trees
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has called on the government for the immediate dissolution of parliament and holding a snap election, since it has lost its mandate to govern following the defeat at the LG polls. Earlier, on Sunday, the likes of Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila, too, stated as much as the results were being announced. No doubt, the adrenalin of victory flowing through their veins has blinded MR and his cohorts to reality.
Both, the former President and his disciples in the JO are well aware that parliament cannot be dissolved until after four and a half years since the day of its official summoning, as explained by UNF National List MP Dr. Jayampathy Wickramarathne yesterday. Winning a majority of local council elections can have no bearing on parliament.
The general election was held in August 2015, and, the President is empowered to dissolve parliament, if he so wishes, only in February 2020, and, the JO will have to sweat it out a good two years, to the day, before this could happen, if at all.
Of course there are many imponderables, in the intervening period. The presidential election is due in January 2020, and, at this stage, it is premature to speculate who will run for president, either from the UNP, SLFP, or, the pohottuwa. A realignment of forces also cannot be ruled out, or, as happened in 2015, a Common Candidate thrown up. Mahinda Rajapaksa, of course, will be out of the reckoning, having had his wings clipped by the 19th amendment, even in the event there is a realignment of forces.
Besides, the outcome of an election to chose local government members whose chief concern will be to attend to such matters as garbage disposal and the repairs to culverts and roads in towns and villages cannot be a criteria to judge the strength of a mandate received by a government at a general election, which is what Rajapaksa and his team are bent on. That mandate is for a term of five years and it has to run its ordinary course, unless the President decides to terminate it after four and half years. Besides, the President cannot dissolve parliament at a time of Rajapaksas choosing, even if he wants to, due to the constitutional bar. One recalls that during the tenure of Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake the government lost almost all the local government elections and even by-elections, but there was no call for the government to step down.
It is being speculated that the UNP is set to form a government of its own, with its partners in the UNF, and, party men have expressed confidence of securing a working majority towards this end, perhaps with the support of some SLFP ministers and MPs. If this happens, it will be the end of road for the unity government, which was welcomed by most, as this brought about a breath of fresh air into an otherwise contentious and acrimonious political milieu, in this country. Circumstances certainly had changed, with the results of the LG poll.
It is time that, whatever shape the government takes, it gets its act together. In a way, the jolt the government received could well be a blessing in disguise. It has two full years in which to make amends, and, introduce people friendly policies that could turn the tide. There will be at least two national budgets, to present, during this period, and, the government could come up with the goods.
However, in no way should law and order and the principles of good governance be compromised. The cases pending against the corrupt under the former regime should be pursued with, in all earnest. Like JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa said, the other day, this election was fought by the Rajapaksa camp for much higher stakes than is normally the case with a mundane local council elections. Rajapaksa and Co. were all out to use the victory gained to suppress investigations against the corrupt acts of the former first family, hoping that the police officers and members of the judiciary would sit on the cases. There is also general talk that, with the pohottuwa victory, the people could now be mobilized to surround court houses, in a much bigger way than before, in shows of strength, by which they hope to intimidate the judiciary.
This electoral setback by the government should also not be allowed to deteriorate into a state where the state machinery could be paralyzed by politically motivated acts in the state sector. There have been instances in the past where public servants, sympathetic to certain political parties, engaging in sabotage, at a time the political equation has changed. As already mentioned, there is a full two years left in the present governments lifespan and no slackening in official functions should be tolerated. The government should assert itself in this respect. Just because the opposition won a Pradeshiya Sabha election, the state machinery is still in the hands of the government and it should not hesitate to deal firmly with those who are of a different mindset.

Multiple talents rolled into one
The present encomium is focussed only on one specific aspect of Media Veteran Srimath Indrajith Liyanage's multifaceted efficiencies. In stark truth, he is a rare genius of variegated talents and skills. His current publication titled as Akasmika Adaraya (Magnetic Love) is by itself high testimony to his multifarious creative incarnations.
At surface level, the present work is an anthology of lyrics when we move further through his collection. We see that it is illustrated and alluringly at that.
Range of guises
If you delve deeper, you make the pleasantly surprising discovery that the recurring romantic lover in the author himself appearing in a whole range of guises, that compressively portray, the series of appearance changes, a modern lover could go through.
His love lyrics, composed in a style of his own are enriched with due touches of philosophy that enable reflection on such eternal truths as life and death. His lyrics possess a mystic aura, that appeals to young hearts, earnestly seeking the solace of profound affection.
In effect, the Anthology offers a fresh dimension to the routine valentine spirit, by elevating the tone to greater romantic and philosophic state.
The author's style and is the adept utilization of language, to soak it with sufficient emotional content to tickle the hearts of youthful worshippers at the shrine of Valentine and what it represents, should receive the admiration of all discriminating critics.
Disciplined creativity
There is not even a trace of any concept or expression, that goes counter to accepted norms of disciplined creativity. Srimath Indrajith Liyanage's surprisingly extensive range of abilities is undoubtedly astonishing.
He makes substantial contributions via electronic media. He has acquired a fairly noteworthy reputation for his result-oriented compering of programmes. He conducts popular classes to train people in the creative professional use of the voice over and above all that, he is a painter.
Who wields the brush in his own inimitable manner. He manages events as part of his professional life.
His capacity for the composing of lyrics is amply proven.
And, that is not all.
Disciplined practice
He is a practising journalist both in print and electronic media, and is a dubbing artist, possessing a considerable demand. What I esteem above all this multitude of talents an skill is his disciplined practice of humanity. He possesses a built-in sense of humility and is never arrogant, aggressive or overbearing over a considerable extension period of time, he has conducted his classes.
The unfluctuating devotion of his students, speaks volumes about his humane outlook.
I wish him a blessed future, that will be illuminated by his dedication to the betterment of life of the ever-renewing young generation of this noble land.

N. Korean leader lauds Souths hospitality
SOUTH KOREA: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has praised the welcome the South gave his sister and said it was important to build on the Olympics-driven momentum for dialogue on the divided peninsula.
Kim's younger sister Kim Yo Jong -- one of his closest confidantes -- was part of the nuclear-armed North's diplomatic delegation to the Games that made worldwide headlines.
She delivered his invitation for the South's President Moon Jae-in to come to a summit in Pyongyang -- which he did not immediately accept, saying the right conditions were needed. The North is subject to multiple sets of UN Security Council sanctions over its banned nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, and conducted dozens of weapons tests last year.
But the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang have triggered extraordinary scenes, with Moon and Kim cheering a unified Korean women's ice hockey team together -- along with the North's ceremonial head of state Kim Yong Nam -- and attending a concert by Pyongyang's artistes. Even so analysts warn that the positive mood could evaporate quickly after the Games, when the US and South are due to hold major joint military exercises that always infuriate the North.
Kim Jong Un met the delegation on Monday after it returned to Pyongyang, the official KCNA news agency reported.
It indirectly cited Kim as saying it was important to enhance the warm climate of reconciliation and dialogue created by the Winter Olympics -- which for months the North refused to say whether it would attend.
He gave instructions for practical measures to do so, it added, without giving details.
The South's appreciation of the North's presence and the welcome it gave its representatives were impressive, he said, thanking Seoul for its sincere efforts.
The KCNA report is the first official reaction from Kim -- the third generation of the dynasty to rule the isolated and impoverished North -- since his sister's charm offensive in the South. Kim Yo Jong's visit made her the first member of the family to set foot in the country since the end of the Korean War. Every detail of her trip was scrutinised, from the clothes she wore and her facial expressions to the bag she was carrying and even her handwriting.
But it left South Koreans divided, with some hoping it might usher in a real opportunity for reconciliation while others angrily burned the North Korean flag and criticised Moon for being too soft on Pyongyang.
How deep the rapprochement runs, how far it will go and how long it will last once the Games are over remain very open to question, analysts say.
Pyongyang's Olympic diplomacy has also highlighted differences between Seoul and its key protector the United States over how to handle the reclusive regime and its nuclear weapons programme.
Washington insists that Pyongyang must take concrete steps towards denuclearisation before any talks can begin, while Moon -- whose parents escaped from the North in a US evacuation during the war -- has long argued for closer involvement to bring it to the negotiating table. - AFP

## Title: Our first-class system from a fast bowlers perspective
## Supertitle:

Our first-class system from a fast bowlers perspective
There has been a lot wrong with our first-class domestic cricket and despite several attempts to put it right by past administrators and by the current administration in office no concrete decisions have been arrived at to formulate a system that is most suitable to provide a high level of competition that could bridge the big gap that exists between the current standard of cricket played and Test cricket.
It is only in Sri Lanka that one finds the countrys domestic cricket keep changing to the whims and fancies of the administration that is elected or appointed to office. By doing so there has never been a proper structure in place to ensure the cricketers are provided with a base to play competitive cricket. With the exception of a handful of clubs that compete very strongly with each other, matches played have been so lopsided that there are occasions where a 3-day or 4-day game has finished inside two days. This sort of results do great damage to the first-class system in the country and makes a mockery of what first-class cricket is all about. No one benefits by such competitions and the performances only give a false impression to the public and national selectors and do not paint a true picture of the cricketer himself. That is one of the main reasons why our cricketers struggle to compete with other countries at top level when they make their entry into international cricket.
Omesh Wijesiriwardene, a former Sri Lanka A and under 19 fast bowling all-rounder with plenty of experience of playing domestic club cricket and English league cricket was of the opinion that in the last decade or so the first-class cricket played in Sri Lanka has remained the same with no improvement in the playing standards.
There are enough of ways to do it or go about it. In our country with spin being dominant there is no chance as we play most of the matches on dusty pitches with no signs of improvement. We have to make changes if we are to move forward, said Wijesiriwardene who is in his first season as coach of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority team playing in the Super 8 of the Premier League.
Wijesiriwardene who is always looking at the positive side of things and wanting to improve the game managed to have two overseas players representing Sri Lanka Ports Authority in the ongoing Premier league.
Why we cannot produce good fast bowlers is that our fast bowlers have still not mastered the art of how to reverse swing with the Kookaburra ball. I have played with Mohammad Sami (the Pakistan fast bowler) and we are good friends. I brought Samis bowling partner in Karachi Adeel Malik and played him in our domestic tournament first round. He bowls differently according to situations and sessions. When you talk to him you learn a lot of things how he sets batsmen up to get their wicket, said Wijesiriwardene.
I remember Kumar Dharmasena (who played with me for Bloomfield) who umpired our first match saying that he has never seen a bowler reverse swinging the ball both ways. The way Adeel sets up batsmen was unbelievable. Sometimes he does not have a final leg at all he sets the field in a unique way and then reverse swings the ball surprising the batsman, he said.
In Sri Lanka we are doing the same thing every time. We are way behind time at least by four years in developing new techniques. By the time we start doing things other countries have developed new methods. This must change we cannot be bringing foreign players or coaches all the time to learn new techniques in bowling. We must know how to update ourselves.
Another area Wijesiriwardene delved into was why our fast bowlers get injured regularly.
Why they are getting injured is easy to understand. They hardly get to bowl in domestic matches. For instance in one of our matches a fast bowler didnt bowl the entire day, the entire attack was based on spin. We cant do this every day. It is obvious that fast bowlers break down when they play in a Test match because they are not fit enough to bowl for five days, Wijesiwardene observed.
We need to play at least 3-4 fast bowlers in every match in club cricket which is not happening at the moment. We also need to change the type of balls we use from Kookaburra to Duke balls which lasts long and are hard. With a Duke ball you cannot spin it as much as the spinners enjoy doing with the Kookaburra. They have to work hard to get a grip on it and get spin. The seam of a Duke ball is flatter than a Kookaburra. It is good for the bowlers because they will have to work hard for their wickets rather than get them cheaply with less effort.
The presence of Nick Compton the former England Test opener in the Sri Lanka Ports Authority dressing room has done wonders for the team, according to Wijesiriwardene, a UK qualified Level 2 coach.
We need to improve our local cricket culture. In the dressing room we just dont discuss cricket but with Nick coming that has changed. He has got talking to the young players and started expressing and exchanging ideas with them which is good. Inside a dressing room we need to improve our cricket culture not only on the field, Wijesiriwardene said.
The way I see it we need to have more overseas players coming and playing for our local clubs so that our players will benefit by their experience. If we play with them only we will also learn a lot about their professional approach and how they handle themselves on the field, he said.
Well that is a player cum coachs perspective and food for thought for SLC if they are really keen on developing our domestic cricket structure.

Over 180 Local Govt. hung councils
Last Saturdays Local Government elections have resulted in over 180 Local Governments having hung councils with no party winning a clear majority.
Whilst the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) was able to secure victory in 239 Local Governments,followed by the United National Party (UNP) with 41, Tamil National Alliance with 34 and the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) jointly securing 10 - the parties have not been able to win a 50 percent or more majority to run many of these councils.
This unprecedented electoral pattern has resulted in hung Local Governments across the country for the first time in the countrys history.
These Local Government authorities which span across the country include some of the main bodies in every district such as the: Kurunegala Municipal Council, Matara Municipal Council, Kalutara Urban Council, Kataragama Pradeshiya Sabha, Polonnaruwa Municipal Council, Nuwara Eliya Pradeshiya Sabha, Mannar Urban Council, Matale Municipal Council, Vavuniya Urban Council, Balangoda Urban Council, Nallur Pradeshiya Sabha, Attanagalla Pradeshiya Sabha, Ja-Ela Pradeshiya Sabha, Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha, Negombo Municipal Council, Kandy Municipal Council, Dehiwela-Mt Lavinia Municipal Council, Trincomalee Urban Council, Badulla Municipal Council, Poonakary Pradeshiya Sabha, Anuradhapura Municipal Council, Batticaloa Municipal Council, Kegalle Urban Council, Chilaw Urban Council, Potuvil Pradeshiya Sabha, Galle Municipal Council and Hambantota Municipal Council.
The Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 2012 Section 66B, decrees that any recognised political party or independent group which has obtained 50 percent or more of the total number of seats in local authority, the Commissioner will call upon its secretary or leader to declare who the Mayor and Deputy Mayor of the local authority
Secretary to the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils H.T. Kamal Pathmasiri observed that when the Local Councils convene on March 6, the parties would have to show a clear majority to the Provincial Commissioner in order to appoint a Mayor, Chairman and Deputy Mayor.
The person or party who shows that he has majority support will be given the post. Thus the parties will have to come to an understanding by then, he said.
The failure of a single party or coalition to secure a clear majority would result in many of the projects, budgets and plans drawn up by one party being defeated by the other, resulting in stagnation in many of our localities.
The government is yet to decide on how power would be shared at Local Government level.

Pakistan envoy calls for just resolution of Kashmir issue
The Pakistani High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Dr. Shahid Ahmad Hashmat said the long lasting peace in the region can only prevail through just and fair resolution of the Kashmir dispute in consonance with UNSC resolutions and recognition of the basic right of self-determination, enshrined in the UN Charter and universally acknowledged.
Dr. Shahid Hashmat was addressing a seminar organized by the High Commission of Pakistan in Sri Lanka recently.
The rest of the panelists who addressed the seminar were Chairman, Kashmir Study Forum Sri Lanka, Jamalud Deen, Analyst and Philanthropist from Pakistan, Air Commodore Shabbir Ahmad Khan and renowned Sri Lankan journalist and Editor International Desk of Wijeya Newspapers Ameen Izzadeen.
The High Commissioner underlined that the ongoing political struggle for freedom of Kashmir spans over last 70 years. The Kashmiris were promised their right of self-determination by the international community but the resolution of this longstanding dispute is nowhere and Kashmiris are still facing perverse aggression. He added that owing to the Kashmir dispute, the relations between Pakistan and India, two important members of SAARC, are very strained.
Dr. Shahid Hashmat emphasized that SAARC countries in particular and South Asia in general can enjoy the fruits of economic progress and development, if the political stability and peace prevails in the region and peace in the region will not be achieved until the resolution of this dispute in accordance with the aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.
The High Commissioner underscored that Pakistan is totally against all forms and manifestation of terrorism and made great sacrifices to eliminate terrorism from its soil. He added that the effort to confuse the just, fair and legitimate struggle of Kashmiris with terrorism is absolutely incorrect and unjust. He reiterated Pakistans unflinching support to Kashmiris until they attain their basic right of freedom and liberty. He appreciated the people of Sri Lanka for their support to the just cause of Kashmiris.
Chairman, Kashmir Study Forum Jamalud Deen urged the United Nations to play its due role in ending the gross human rights violations of innocent Kashmiris and ensure expedited UNSC Resolutions of Jammu and Kashmir dispute in line with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
During the occasion, Air Commodore Shabbir Ahmad Khan said that Jammu and Kashmir is the core dispute between India and Pakistan. He said the resolution of the Kashmir dispute is essential for regional peace and development.
While reading his paper, the Editor, International Desk of Wijeya Newspapers, Ameen Izzadeen said the underlying principle in any solution to the Kashmiri issue should be that it should be acceptable to the people of Kashmir on both sides of the line of control.
Major General (R) Udaya Annesly Perera moderated the seminar proceedings. He said the international community is not paying due attention to the resolution of Kashmir because it is a low intensity conflict. However, he emphasized that Kashmir dispute is a long protracted conflict and Kashmiris have suffered a lot since last 70 years. He urged from India, the UN and the international community to work in unison to find a fair and just resolution of the dispute in accordance with the UN resolutions and aspirations of Kashmiri people.

PyeongChang Winter Olympics lift Asias profile as a winter sports venue
The Korean government and people humbly share the pride of hosting PyeongChang Olympic and Paralympic Winter Game. In particular, Korea hopes that as the Seoul 1988 Summer Olympics served as an opportunity to overcome the Cold War between East and West and promote unity, the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, the second Olympics in the ROK, will provide the momentum for peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula, in Northeast Asia and around the world by becoming the driving force behind the resumption of inter-Korean talks and North Koreas participation in the Olympics.
Marking another chapter in the history of the Olympic Games, the PyeongChang 2018 Games will be an excellent opportunity to further promote Olympic values in Asia. Korea is hosting the first of the next series of Games to be held in Asia, followed by the Tokyo Summer Olympics 2020 and the Beijing Winter Olympics 2022. In particular, Asia is a blank canvas in terms of winter sports and has immeasurable potential to open new horizons in the field. PyeongChang is dedicated to promoting winter sports and attracting investment throughout Asia.
PyeongChang is located in a mountain range in the east of South Korea at an altitude of 700 meters above sea level. With long winters and heavy snow, it is an ideal setting for winter sports.
With its favorable geographic location in Asia and access to emerging and fast-growing markets, PyeongChang 2018 hopes to create a legacy of new growth and potential. Indeed, PyeongChang 2018s vision is to open up New Horizons for the Olympic movement and for the world of winter sports. The Organizing Committee aspires to expand winter sports in Asia and transform Gangwon Province into a winter sports hub and tourist destination.
With our optimized design of the venue, all Games-related facilities are located within a 30-minute radius of the PyeongChang Olympic Stadium and Plaza. Accordingly, participating athletes, spectators and media will be able to easily travel between venues. This will be conducive to competition-centered and athlete-oriented Games, where everyone will be able to enjoy optimum performances by athletes.
Along with the array of sports competitions, the Cultural Olympiad for the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Games will offer an exciting program of culture, entertainment, festivals and educational activities held across the country which aims to connect everyone to the Games.
The 40-day festival will welcome all and run through until the final day of the Paralympic Winter Games on March 18.
There will be exhibitions and performances of leading traditional and contemporary Korean artists, street parades, cheering events and K-pop concerts.
The PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Torch Relay began in Korea with the arrival of the Olympic flame on November 1, 2017, which also marked 100 days to the Olympic Winter Games Opening Ceremony. 7,500 torchbearers have traveled 2018 kilometers by various means of transportation representing the past, present, and future of Korea.
President of the Organizing Committee for the 2018 PyeongChang Olympic and Paralympic Games, LEE Hee-beom, remarked It will also be a Winter Games that will open up new horizons for Gangwon Province as a tourist destination, and Asia as a winter sports hub for us all to enjoy for many years to come.

Record-breaking 700,000 wedding cake
A renowned British celebrity cake designer has revealed her latest stunning creation - a $1million (700,000) masterpiece in the shape of a life-sized bride.
Debbie Wingham's astonishing 6ft cake features five flawless three-carat white diamonds, each valued at 145,000, along with smaller stones on the head dress.
It also boasts 1,000 pearls and 5,000 hand-cut flowers, and was so heavy at more than 100kg (16st) that five people were needed to carry it.
The 'record-breaking' cake took 10 days to make the cake with a lot of bling and a lot of ingredients, including 1,000 eggs, 25kg of chocolate and 50kg of lace-textured fondant.
London-based Wingham, 36, sculpted the cake for a wedding show in Dubai and holds the current record for the world's most expensive cake, at 50million.
The "world's most expensive designer" teased the creation on her Instagram account, and made the big reveal at the Dubai Bride Show on Wednesday night.
Exhausted Wingham, who worked long hours each day, wrote: "Ta dah! The big reveal! Introducing the million dollar bride!!! Inspired by Arabian influence this was her in the beautiful Raffles Dubai where she was created."
Her creation was a collaboration with the hotel's pastry team.
She told the Khaleej Times: "The diamonds were actually sourced from one of my UAE-based clients who was only too happy to loan them to me. No one actually believes it's a cake. In fact, she is as good as a living being for me. I call her Lulwa [meaning pearls in Arabic]."
"I have often been influenced by Middle Eastern culture. To actually make a Middle Eastern-inspired wedding cake is really up there with my other exciting endeavours. Most of my pieces are based on realism and I am glad that people liked it."
The former haute couture designer has an exclusive baking business called Couture to Cakes, which currently has a waiting list of more than six months.
In 2015 a wealthy family in the United Arab Emirates paid almost 50million for one of her cakes, making it the most expensive one ever made.
The cake - for a woman's joint birthday and engagement party - weighed as much as a grizzly bear and featured a thousands of stones that were a carat or more, including a 5.2-carat pink diamond, a 6.4-carat yellow diamond and 15 five-carat white diamonds.
Wingham turned to baking after previously making the world's most expensive dress for 11.5million from black and red diamonds.
Last year she created the worlds most expensive pair of shoes, value at 10million. Before that she had created the worlds most expensive black diamond dress, followed by a red diamond abaya gown.
The new bridal cake is also the tallest cake she has ever made.
A spokeswoman for Wingham said: The bridal gown cake is so elegant, the material looks so realistic its hard to believe its meant to be eaten. The cake techniques included cake lace, embossing, sculpting and moulding and even creating edible fabric using rice paper and some modern techniques adopted from Debbies days as one of the worlds finest couturiers.This fabric manipulation can be seen as the fondant comes to life and looks like material."
Wingham used to dress the rich and famous, with celebrity clients including Katy Perry, Kate Winslet, Justin Bieber and Drake.
She has worked on shows including X-Factor and Downton Abbey.

DHAKA: Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan has been ruled out of the first Twenty20 international against Sri Lanka after he failed to recover from a finger injury, it was announced Tuesday.
The star all-rounder also missed the recent Test series against Sri Lanka after sustaining the injury during the one-day international tri-series final against the same opponents in January.
Bangladesh, who lost the tri-series final and the Test series, initially included Shakib in their squad for the two T20 matches, the first of which is on Thursday in Dhaka.
He was making good progress so we thought he might be available for both the matches. But it seems now he cannot play the first Twenty20, said chief selector Minhajul Abedin.
Batsman Mahmudullah, who captained Bangladesh in the Test series in Shakib's absence, will also fill in as skipper for the T20 opener.
Selectors asked left-arm spinner Nazmul Hossain to join the squad as a replacement for Shakib in the first game.

## Supertitle:

SIR DON BARON JAYATILAKA: THE EPOCH MAKER
In the early part of the 20th century educated Europeans and especially the Englishmen evinced a great deal of interest in Buddhism due to its non violent, humanitarian and non invasive qualities. Being a brilliant speaker and Buddhist scholar D.B. Jayatilaka had to travel to different parts of England and many European cities to deliver speeches on Buddhism and participate in religious conferences. During his three years in England he wrote regularly to the Sinhala newspapers on a variety of subjects which were widely read and appreciated. He returned to Sri Lanka in 1913 to a heros welcome and was sworn in as a Barrister of the Supreme Court. He practiced at the Bar in Colombo and the outstations. He specialized in Buddhist Ecclesiastical Law, Buddhist Temporalities and Constitutional Law.
On his return to the island he found that the nascent national and religious reawakening had gained further momentum. He got down to action immediately and established the Buddhist Education Society and the Buddhist Protection Society. His lifelong ambition was to make Vidyodaya and Vidyalankara Pirivenas premier seats of oriental studies in Sri Lanka. At that time the vast majority of the population resorted to the Ayurvedic System of Medicine as a mode of treatment for all their ailments.
He campaigned for the establishment of the College of Ayurveda Medicine in Sri Lanka. He was also an active member of the Ayurveda Council of Sri Lanka. Through his island wide programmes encompassing Buddhist, Educational, Social, Cultural and Literary activities he became the unrivalled leader of the Sinhala Buddhists while winning the confidence and admiration of people of the other nationalities and faiths. At the same time he was in the forefront of the political reform movement as well, which was meant to obtain freedom from colonial rule.
From the dawn of the 20th century the enmity between the Buddhists and the Muslims was growing due to social, economic and political reasons. On Vesak day in 1915 when a Buddhist procession was passing a Mosque in Kandy it was stoned. Riots broke out. Buddhist leaders were arrested indiscriminately on suspicion of conspiracy and treason. Even D.B. Jayatilaka whose credentials were well known was not spared.
Martial Law was declared and there were mass arrests and indiscriminate shooting without trial. Almost all the Sinhala Buddhist leaders including temperance activists were jailed. The ruthless quelling of the riots by the colonial administration saw Sinhala and Tamil leaders forging greater unity in mounting the struggle for freedom. Thus, at the conclusion of the riots the movement for legislative and administrative reforms gathered momentum and infused greater vigour and vitality,
In 1918, a delegation seeking political reforms with D.B. Jayatilaka as its secretary left for England. The Ceylon National Congress was established and from 1919 it took on the full responsibility for spearheading the political reform movement. The British government had a hideous image of the Sinhalese in particular; obviously coloured by the malicious brush of colonial officials, Europe on planters, foreign businessmen and their local henchmen. The Sinhalese Kandyans were also not fully supportive of the reform struggle. The colonial office remained stubborn and unsympathetic. D.B. Jayatilaka the Oxford educated Barrister who was also a fine debater and a shrewd negotiator stayed behind in England and campaigned for reforms.
The British government published the constitutional reforms in the Government Gazette of September 23, 1920. However the reforms were not favourably received by the people and the leaders. They were far below their expectations. Everyone, other than the colonial masters and their cronies publicly rejected the reform package. However, D.B. Jayatilaka the wise statesman rose to the occasion and managed to douse the fire. He explained that it was not feasible nor practicable to leapfrog from Crown Colony to Independence in one go. He convinced his fellow freedom fighters of the need to exercise caution, stay patient and move ahead step by step. He united the different races and formed a common front to call for a greater measure of self determination and independence.
In response in 1923 the Governor released a white paper on political reforms. It was disappointing for it did not carry any semblance of a democratic form of government. The order in council of 1924 published the reforms which provided for a clear unofficial majority, territorial representation, the Governor ceasing to be the President of the Legislative Council and instead making provision for an elected Vice President to preside.
However, it was a futile exercise as the reforms conferred power without responsibility. At the elections to the Legislative Council in 1924 D.B. Jayatilaka was elected uncontested to the Colombo District seat. Upon the death of Sir James Peiris, D.B. Jayatilaka was unanimously elected Vice President of the Legislative Council. He went on to serve in many committees and commissions of the Legislative Council and the colonial administration with distinction.
Forerunner in the march to self rule
The Legislative Reforms of 1924 did not satisfy the national leaders nor the people and their demand for self rule continued unabated gathering momentum visibly and rapidly. Yielding to greater pressure and persistent agitation the British government appointed the Donoughmore Commission in 1927. The Donoughmore reforms granted a considerable degree of self rule and took Sri Lanka to the door step of independence. It gave self determination in many spheres and subjects.
The granting of universal adult suffrage was a singular achievement. Yet for all, many opposed the new constitution. However, fortunately the Ceylon National Congress was of the view that half a loaf was better than no loaf.
The Ceylon National Congress by majority vote decided to accept the Donoughmore Constitution. This led to the splitting of the congress.
The Tamils were against it as the balance of power would automatically shift in favour of the Sinhala majority. Once again D.B. Jayatilaka had to rise to the occasion as the savior. In the face of mounting opposition and simmering internal dissension, as a last resort D.B. Jayatilaka embarked on an island wide campaign to seek the approval of the masses for the new constitution. Wiser counsel prevailed and in 1929 the Legislative Council by majority vote decided to proceed with the Donoughmore Constitution. The first election to the State Council took place in 1931 and D.B. Jayatilaka was elected as the Member for Kelaniya electorate. Thereafter, he was elected as a member of the Home Affairs Committee as well as its Chairman which automatically elevated him to the office of Minister of Home Affairs. Concurrently, he was elected as Vice Chairman of the State Council and Leader of the State Council; which made him the de facto Prime Minister even though there was no such position under the new Constitution.

The victory recorded by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna is a historic turn in Sri Lankan politics, the Chief of Adivasi people Uruwarige Wannila Aththo said yesterday.
Wannila Aththo said: A new party recorded the victory at the Local Government polls this time.

I believe this will go down in Sri Lankan political history as a party with a very short history defeating the largest two political parties in the country.
I am personally baffled by this victory, he added.

Solve SAITM issue immediately: Alwis
The President and the Prime Minister should solve the SAITM issue immediately without dragging it, Media Coordinator of the Parents' Union of Medical Students Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Organization of Professionals Association in Colombo yesterday, he said both the SAITM and state medical students' parents have come to an agreement that all qualified SAITM students should be offered an MBBS from the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) or a state medical faculty recognized by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). Others should be offered an SLMC-recognized foreign MBBS from a recognized foreign university. All other parties connected to the SAITM issue agreed to this decision.
According to Alwis, the entire country had rejected the government's stand on the SAITM. Therefore, the government should remove the Health Minister, Higher Education Minister and Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva immediately and solve the SAITM issue. The Health Minister sent home the previous regime and this regime. If the government does not solve the SAITM issue, parents will take tougher action against the government and they will make sure that this government will be defeated in all upcoming elections.
SAITM Medical Students' Parents' Association Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said the government should solve the SAITM issue within two weeks and send all qualified SAITM students to the KDU Medical Faculty or another state medical faculty and others to an SLMC - recognized foreign university.

## Title: Sri Lankas digital divide
## Supertitle:

Sri Lankas digital divide
On Internet Safety Day last week, UNICEF Sri Lanka launched a landmark study on the digital landscape of Sri Lanka, specifically relating to children and their internet usage. The report, titled Keeping Children Safe and Empowered Online: A Study on Sri Lankas Digital Landscape, revealed that Sri Lanka has a digital divide- that is, a gulf between those who have ready access to computers or the internet and those who do not.
According to the report, this divide exists across the board, within the categories of gender, geographic location, socio-economic class and more. Boys have more internet access than girls, urban children have more internet access than rural and plantation children, and children from wealthier families have more internet access than children from poorer families.
The report also identified key risks children face when on the internet, such as misusing private information, accessing harmful content, and cyberbullying.
At a launch event for the report, held at the Institute of Policy Studies in Colombo, the digital divide and aforementioned risks were discussed by UNICEF officials as well as a panel of expert representatives from an array of relevant fields, all of whom put forth proposed solutions.
Details of the study
In order to understand the digital habits of children in the country, UNICEF Sri Lanka worked with the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure and the Institute for Participatory Interaction in Development (IPID) to survey and collect data from over 5,000 children. Of the children surveyed, 4,845 attend government schools (urban, rural, and plantation), 429 attend private schools including international ones and 75 were reached at telecentres.
Children were then further divided into three categories and given a different survey depending on which of the following categories they fell under: non-IT users (children with no access to a digital device or the internet), non-online IT users (children who had access to a digital device but not the internet) and online IT users (children with access to a digital device and access to the internet). Non-IT users comprised 7 percent of the children surveyed, non-online IT users comprised 40 percent and online IT users comprised 53 percent.
In addition to these surveys, those behind the study also collected school data from 60 principles island-wide, held 66 focus group discussions with 696 children and 29 focus group discussions with 216 parents and conducted several key informant interviews with government policymakers, international organisations, national opinion leaders, media personnel, academics, NGO leaders and corporate leaders to outline policy issues related to the online access and security of children.
The digital divide
Studies have shown that children who have access to the internet are exposed to a wealth of benefits. But according to the report, while 52.8 percent of young people in Sri Lanka overall have access to the internet - with the average age of first access being 13 - this access is far from equitable. The digital divide in Sri Lanka is real.
Among the 11-18 year old children surveyed, 67.6 percent of boys reported having internet access while just 33.1 percent of girls reported the same.
This gender disparity has grave consequences for the future careers envisioned by these child IT users.
The report also highlighted a difference in terms of career aspiration and employment prospects, explained a press release distributed at the launch event.
When asked, 25 percent of respondent boys hoped to gain employment in engineering compared to just 9 percent of girls. Moreover, 6.2 percent of boys hoped to find employment in IT or software related industries compared to just 1.9 percent of girls.
Variances among region, ethnicity and educational attainment also persisted.
Among urban children, 67.8 percent reported having internet access, compared to 47.1 percent of rural children and 39.3 percent of plantation children. Muslim children reported a significantly higher rate of internet access (66 percent) than Tamil (50.3 percent) and Sinhala (51.7 percent) children. And children who have been educated through A-Level exams reported a higher rate of internet access (70.5 percent) than children who have only been educated through O-Level (58.7 percent) and children who have only attended school up to grades 6 through 9 (34.9 percent).
Speaking at the launch event, UNICEF country representative Tim Sutton said, Digital technology and the internet has the potential to be a game changer for children and adolescents in Sri Lanka - especially vulnerable and disadvantaged communities - by providing new opportunities to learn, socialize, make their voices heard and prepare for the future.
However, he continued, These same technologies can also be a dividing line, exacerbating and enabling inequities to prevail. We must work together to ensure the benefits and opportunities of the digital world are open to all children while ensuring their safety and security online.
Risks for children online
The ideal, of course, would be to ensure that every child in Sri Lanka has equitable internet access. But that alone wont solve the problem. For as the UNICEF report outlines, children who access the internet are also highly at risk for various dangerous behaviours.
According to the report, Whilst children and adolescents are increasingly going online, they are doing so without adult oversight or supervision. Explains the report further: When asked, 53.6 percent of child online IT users responded that they were self-taught about the internet, compared to 16.5 percent who were taught by parents.
And this trend of self-teaching can have grave consequences, especially in an arena where privacy is so often an afterthought.
Of the child online IT users surveyed, 46.3 percent said they communicated with people they did not know online and 27.9 percent of these respondents said they physically met a stranger from online in person. To the concern of many, 18.3 percent of these children said they met such strangers without informing someone beforehand.
Further privacy and safety issues abound with childrens internet access. Of the respondents, 15.1 percent admitted to giving true, private information such as their name, age, telephone number or email to strangers online.
Then there are issues of bullying and of sending or receiving compromising photos. Explains the report: A proportion of those who undertake risky behaviour admitted to sending nasty messages that could hurt someones feelings (24.8 percent) and sending or uploading adult images, video, or text (10.7 percent).
How to keep children safe online
The question, then, is how to ensure equitable internet access for all children while keeping them safe online. Luckily, the study and the panel participants provided several recommendations for action.
The first recommendation is to provide more quality online Sinhala- and Tamil-language content. According to UNICEFs global report on children in a digital world released last year, 56 percent of all websites are in English and many children cannot find content they understand or that is culturally relevant.
Other recommendations followed, such as enacting legislation to ensure the safe use of the internet by children, establishing a self-regulatory body of telecommunications and IT industry partners, encouraging internet service providers to introduce network-level parental controls to customers and developing age-specific educational and training material into the IT curriculums in schools.
On a broader level, it is also crucial to ensure that more children have not just literacy but access to using the internet, lest Sri Lanka be left out of the impending third industrial revolution.
Sutton of UNICEF puts it simply: As Sri Lanka identifies and positions itself for a new role in the wider region and drives to become a knowledge-based economy as a route to further prosperity, it is clear that the digital skills and wellbeing of its young people will be fundamental. By utilizing the insight presented in this report and by implementing the clear recommendations, we can help to ensure that we maximize the vast opportunities provided by digital technology to children whilst minimizing the risk of harm, for the benefit of all of Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka never shied away from UN responsibilities: Ambassador Aryasinha
Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to UN in Geneva Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha said over 70 years since Independence, Sri Lanka has never shied away from taking its fair share of responsibility in the UN system, which has helped Sri Lanka build an image as a moderate and progressive partner, able to bridge differences and build consensus.
He said, in Geneva, Sri Lanka continues to give leadership on a wide range of issues such as disarmament, migration, human rights, health, intellectual property, science and technology, and international trade policy.
Ambassador Aryasinha made these observations when he addressed representatives of the diplomatic community, UN and other international organizations based in Geneva and friends of Sri Lanka, at a ceremony held to celebrate Sri Lankas 70th Independence anniversary, at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on Tuesday, February 6.
Permanent Sri Lankan Representative to World Trade Organization (WTO) Ambassador R. D. S. Kumararatne, Deputy Permanent Representative to UN Samantha Jayasuriya, and mission staff were associated with the ambassador at the event.

It comprised of seven facets: Reflections of Sri Lankas Foreign Relations, Sri Lanka in Geneva, Intellectual Property Assets of Sri Lanka, Visit Sri Lanka, Buy and Invest with Sri Lanka, Flavors of Sri Lanka, and Rhythms of Sri Lanka, which featured the state dance ensemble of the Cultural Affairs Ministry. A commemorative publication built around the seven themes was also launched at the event.
As a special tribute to the UN and other international organizations that the Sri Lanka Mission collaborates with in its day to day work, Facets of Sri Lanka was inaugurated by WIPO Director-General Dr. Francis Gurry, with United Nations Office in Geneva (UNOG) Director-General Michael Mller, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, International Organization for Migration (IOM) Director-General Ambassador William Lacy Swing, International Labour Organisation (ILO) Director-General Guy Ryder, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Secretary-General Dr. Mukhisa Kituyi, Inter Parliamentary Union (IPU) Secretary-General Martin Chungong, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Secretary-General John E.

(GS) Christian Blmann, and interlocutors from these and other organizations based in Geneva.

In terms of volume Softlogic Holdings & LVL Energy led foreign purchases while Anilana Hotels & Lankem Developments led foreign sales.
In terms of value Softlogic Holdings & JKH led foreign purchases while Janashakthi Insurance & Hemas Holdings led foreign sales.
Point of view
Equity markets remained in positive territory yet again this week with the broad-share ASPI recording W-o-W gains for the third consecutive week.
Despite a 13.2 point loss early in the week, the ASPI rebounded sharply on Thursday and Friday (by 65 points) to close the week ~52 points higher.
A strong come-back by Retailers on the back of last weeks strategic sale of JINS General Insurance to Global giant Allianz along with a rebound in Foreign interest (net foreign purchases increased 182% W-o-W to record the 3rd highest net foreign position so far this year) helped the Index close comfortably above the key 6500-mark. Gains on the ASPI stood in stark contrast to peer EM/FM equities, which recorded six consecutive days of losses as the global stock rout continued. Global equity markets have tumbled since Monday as US stocks crashed (from their nearly nine year bull run) on concerns of rising inflation and higher bond yields triggered by positive wage data which showed wages growing at its fastest pace in over 81/2 years.
Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields - a broad gauge of inflation expectations- rose to a 4-year high, highlighting investor fears that the synchronized recovery in US and EU would prompt the US Fed to raise rates at a faster than anticipated pace in order to rein inflation pressure.
Domestic equities however, have remained largely immune to Global market developments and markets in the week ahead are likely to seek direction both from the outcome of the LG elections and the CBSLs first monetary policy statement for the year.
Initial earnings negative; fitch retains rating
Initial corporate earnings of the Dec17 quarter have been largely negative, with ~66% of the 47 companies who have reported results so far recording Y-o-Y declines in earnings.
While the overall direction of the total corporate earnings is difficult to gauge at this early stage (only 16% of the total market has reported results so far), JKHs (a broad proxy for the overall market) 13% Y-o-Y decline in earnings implies that earnings growth this quarter could potentially be negative.
Nevertheless, Banks have yet to report their earnings and the direction of this will be crucial in determining the overall direction of market earnings for the quarter as Banks typically account for ~40% of total market earnings (Diversified account for ~16%).
Fitch Ratings meanwhile retained its B+ (Stable Outlook) on Sri Lanka citing the revised policy framework. The ratings agency added that policies aimed at fiscal consolidation along with a more disciplined monetary stance under the framework of IMFs three-year programme have improved Sri Lanka's policy coherence and credibility.
Fitch estimates that although 2017 GDP growth (3.9% Y-o-Y) is likely to fall short of its original forecast due to weather-related supply disruptions, growth should stabilise at ~ 5% in 2018/19. Fitch added though that Sri Lanka's external debt service outlook remains challenging over 2019-22 as external debt service payments total ~$15Bn cf. current reserve levels of $7.7Bn. The Group noted that although the expected approval of the liability management bill in 2018 should allow for smoother debt payments, the scale of the external refinancing creates potential vulnerabilities especially in the context of expected monetary tightening in developed markets.

UNP group wants its own Govt.
The UNP Parliamentary group together with members of the United National Front (UNF) met at Temple Trees yesterday evening to express their support to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to form a Government of their own.
UNP MP Kavinda Jayawardena speaking to the Daily News said the Parliamentarians, Cabinet Ministers and party leaders of the UNF had unanimously supported the Prime Minister and asked that he continue as leader and Prime Minister,
However, we also decided that we needed drastic changes in the management of the party, he added.
The President cannot decide who the leader of the UNP is and nor can he decide who the Prime Ministerial candidate for the UNP should be, Jayawardena further said.
UNP MP Mayantha Dissanayake confirmed that President Maithripala Sirisena during a one-on-one meeting with the Prime Minister on Monday had conveyed the message that the SLFP members in the coalition Government want Prime Minister Wickremesinghe to step down and appoint any other acceptable person from the UNP.
Premier Wickremesinghe was of the view that a decision in that regard has to be taken collectively by the UNP MPs and the Working Committee. The final decision will be arrived at within the next couple of days, he commented.
The call to form a UNP government was also reiterated at a meeting held with 16 UNP backbenchers and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe last morning.
We left the responsibility of making up the numbers in a new government to the leader, said MP Dissanayake speaking to the Daily News last night.
Jayawardena in the meantime said they had the numbers to form their own government and those in the SLFP who wish to remain behind, can do so and the rest can leave.
In an attempt to resolve the political tensions arisen after the Local Government elections, all Cabinet Ministers, Deputy and State Ministers of the UNP having met with the Prime Minister at Temple Trees last night, together headed off to a meeting with the President, to convey their decision to him.
Amidst the political uncertainties over the continuation of the National Unity Government, the Prime Minister met the UNP Parliamentary group in three back-to-back meetings at 11 am, 3 pm and 5.30 pm at Temple Trees facilitating each and every Parliamentarian to express their views.
The PM was very attentive and flexible throughout the meeting while patiently giving an ear to the opinions of all backbenchers, Dissanayake said following the meeting.
He said the UNP backbenchers openly and emphatically told the PM of the need to form a UNP Government and take a lead in the development of the country.
UNP Chairman and Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrema, Law and Order Minister Sagala Rathnayake and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam too joined in the meeting.
Backbenchers Nalin Bandara Jayamaha, Hector Appuhamy, Kavinda Jayawardena, Bandulal Bandarigoda and Thushara Indunil Amarasena too expressed similar sentiments.
Special Committee to resolve issues between SLFP and UNP
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the UNP Cabinet Ministers who met President Maithripala Sirisena at his official residence at Paget Road last night decided to come to a final decision on the future of the Unity Government at a Cabinet meeting scheduled for today (14).
Sources also revealed that a Special Committee would be appointed to resolve issues between the SLFP and UNP in the Unity Government.
The Committee will comprise Ministers Mangala Samaraweera, Thalatha Atukorale, Kabir Hashim, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Sagala Ratnayaka.

UPFRONT,  THE BARD WITHOUT DIALOGUE
Simply impossible
Outrageously irreverent
And the Bard would have squirmed.
Yet, there was one medium that fired the imagination of the mind.
Ballet;
His powerful dialogue in ballet or to simply say, they were danced on stage with equal aplomb as dialogue in drama.
From Shakespearian literature emerged ballet. However spectacular ballet was, it fell short of literary essence found in each and every word the colossal writings yet to be matched by any writer over the past two centuries.
Mighty scores
Without any predecessor, ballet attempts to cover up almost all tragedies of Shakespeare in full-length or as excerpts. They cannot be undertaken in the absence of the mighty scores of Tchaikovsky, Bach, Beethoven and even of the Strauss family of composers. That is how music stepped into replace Shakespeare's dialogue. The dazzling virtuosity, controlled expressions and electrifying charisma of dancers such as Rudolf Nureyev, Margot Fonteyn, Anna Pavlova, Merle Parks, Nijinska, Nijinski, Helpman, etc. have given rise to Bard's characters on stage. They all 'danced' his magnificent words.
It is amazing what goes into something effortless as a ballet or to be more precise, a ballet of virtuosity such as turning a literary-great play of William Shakespeare. Today, all leading choreographers take on such challenges that would have stunned the Bard. His plays were written in specialty of dialogue alone for the scholar and for drama. However, with the emerging decade after decade into centuries, they were boarded as ballets with obstacles and classical music to boost their moral led by such masters like Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev who were responsible in attracting the audiences.
Today, it is a different story where the choreographers are blessed with vibrant stage lighting, amplified or live orchestration in music, technology, camera-tricks ect. They were also helped by the repertories held in ballet companies, in a gallery of a company's dancers and the chronology of ballet's history stored over the years. These aspects moved into magnificent ballets as seen today, with choreographers having access that make ballet more professional. The tutus worn by performing dancers as against the cumbersome formal dresses worn by the yesteryears dancers, shines through today making every movement free and spectacular.
Greatest tragedy
Choreographers moving into Shakespeare drama are an outcome from all these restrictions and freedom to portray such Bard-plays is the dream of every leading dancer around the world. Among his plays, Hamlet is the greatest tragedy and his best story closely followed by Romeo and Juliet while Hamlet and female ones the most sought-after male characters, Juliet and Ophelia are the female ones that choreographers have as priority in ballet. They all are danced by the leading dancers who immortalize them. Lending the fray was Rudolf Nureyev as Romeo and Hamlet while Margot Fonteyn was Juliet, Ophelia by other prominent ballerinas. It was sad that Fonteyn was unable to partner Nureyev's Ophelia.
When Diaghilev died, all his talented people had to look elsewhere around 1929. They were scattered around the world where ballet was thriving. Many of them became teachers in New Zealand, America, Europe while others opted to remain in Europe. Many returned to Russia along with Prokofiev.
But Russia had not developed her ballet because of problems arising from Tsar's regime. However, the strong teaching traditions continued in the country and produced such great dancers like Ulanova and much later, Nureyev who defected to become the world's best dancer to date.
Beyond imagination
In the meantime, Prokofiev toyed with the idea of scoring a suite for Romeo and Juliet and what he came up with is beyond imagination. Even today, choreographers opt for his score in a full length ballet. When the time came to board the ballet in Russia, Prokofiev insisted that Ulanova would be the first to dance the role of Juliet and so it was with the ballet. Fifteen years later in 1956, she took London by storm when an appreciative crowd stood for hours to see her. The Russian version was created by Leonide Lavrovsky and this sumptuous epic was tuned in to a film with equal success.
Galina Ulanova arrived in the guise of Juliet to resurrect her from the grave. For some years John Cranko worked with Kenneth MacMilla to produce this ballet for the Royal Ballet in London with Ulanova herself later to be followed by great stars of the Royal Ballet such as Margot Fonteyn, Seymore, Nureyev, Nijinska, Ashton etc.
Sometimes a great ballet is lost because it can be too subtle to recreate following the original chorographer and too expensive as a full length ballet. Next option is to prune it down to a few Act's but I think in doing so the very essence of a great legend like Romeo and Juliet or for that matter Hamlet, stand the chance of letting down the Shakespearian legacy of great English literature. Unlike in drama where dialogue make up the story value, ballet is helpless for want of expression and depend entirely on movements. Under these circumstances, it is a difficult and complex process of planning performances.
Nevertheless it is the repertory of the ballet that draws dancers from around the world especially when it is a Shakespeare classic. Such stars have to be fast at footwork and lots of movement in the upper body. Dancers' dramatic skills must be very strong and reveal not just dancing steps but a complete part of the story gripping around them. Nureyev for example should shed his personality and be seen as Romeo on stage and not the superstar he is. One must live the role; dance the role to make a ballet like Romeo and Juliet immortal.
The original title was Romeo i Dzhulyetta the ballet in prologue had 3 acts and 13 sense as well as epilogue, directed by Lavrovsky to the music of Prokofiev. It was followed by the Czechoslovakian version in 1938. After reviving for the Bolshoi in 1940 each production achieved better results.
The Covent Garden version was followed by the Stuttgart Ballet and the Royal Sweden Ballet. There is no end for this suite of Romeo and Juliet as it take centre stage in the new millennium.

The people's mandate on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is very clear and it reflects that he has no mandate to function as the Prime Minister nor as a Minister, he said.
State Minister Perera added that even President Maithripala Sirisena had asserted before the election that a caretaker government would function after the Local Government election on February 10.
He added that under this situation Ranil Wickremesinghe should not be the Prime Minister and some other member should be appointed.
Hence, the support of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) would not be extended to a government headed by Wickremesinghe in future, State Minister Perera said.

Why has the Reserve Bank of India killed the Indian Economy
In an interview Kaushik Basu gave to The Hindu on January 24, the former chief economic adviser to the government of India pointed out that when all the recent massaging of Indias growth statistics is filtered out, Indias growth rate has now fallen below the average of the past 30 years. Quite obviously far from bringing back achhe din, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken the Indian economy back to something that is beginning to look dangerously like the Hindu rate of growth in a new saffron avatar.
What is responsible for this The short, blunt answer is the exorbitantly high interest rate regime imposed by the Reserve Bank of India almost eight years ago to curb a short spasm of inflation, which was then maintained relentlessly by a succession of its governors in the face of a pusillanimous finance minister irrespective of how much inflation has fallen. This has killed Indian industry.
Today, the sum total of non-performing loans has reached the terrifying figure of Rs 9,50,000 crore, or $1.4 trillion. Worse still, Rs 1,140,000 crore of capital has been wasted on what the government euphemistically calls stalled, but which are in reality abandoned projects. And worst of all, no fewer than 500 companies that had invested this money are now facing bankruptcy proceedings, and will have their remaining assets sold off at a fraction of their value in the next few years.
Demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) have killed off a large part of the unorganised sector. This will gradually revive, but the RBIs relentless high interest rates are killing the new entrepreneurial class that had come into being economic liberalisation in the 1990s and 2000s.
Why is the RBI doing this What model of banking is it aspiring to emulate To understand this, it is necessary to understand the history of the RBI. A recent, racily written, book by well-known economic journalist TCA Srinivasaraghavan gives insights that help understand its motivation. TCA points out that banking grew out of the need of the rulers to finance war. This gave bankers an early ascendancy over the State that they misused for two centuries before the Wall Street crash of 1929. That, and the Great Recession that followed, forced the United States and European governments to create a lender of the last resort, i.e a central bank that would not only backstop, but also control, all other banks but itself be controlled by the government.
Therein lay the rub. For governments were no less capable of abusing their power to create money than the banks that they set out to tame. This sowed the seeds of a conflict between central banks and governments that ended in Britain, with the Bank of England wresting full control of money supply from the treasury after the Black Monday financial crash in 1992, but has still not ended in India.
The road to autonomy
In India, this struggle began almost on the very day the RBI was born. Till World War I, the financial system of British India had been managed independently by the three presidencies of Bombay, Bengal and Madras. But when the Crown ousted the East India Company after the 1857 uprising, one of the demands it faced was for the creation of a single central bank for India modelled on the Bank of England.
Before then, this need had been partly met by merging the three presidency banks into the Imperial Bank of India, which acted both as a commercial bank and a lender of last resort. This arrangement lasted till the Reserve Bank of India was created in 1935.
Although London made the RBI a shareholders bank in an unmistakable signal that it clearly wanted the RBI to be independent, and deliberately did not buy shares in it, New Delhi had other ideas. Governors who refused to toe the line were first warned and then sacked if they did not get the message. The relationship was characterised by Montagu Norman, the longest serving head of the Bank of England, as a Hindoo marriage wherein the wife advises but does what she is told.
The struggle ended in 1949, when the new Indian government nationalised the RBI. Till the economic crisis of 1990-91, New Delhi exercised the power to create money through the issue of treasury bonds. This kept the control and regulation of money supply firmly in the hands of the Ministry of Finance. The RBIs role was the subordinate one of managing the money already created and administering the interest rates , cash reserve ratios and statutory liquidity ratios fixed by the government. Its advice was, of course , sought, but not necessarily heeded.
he seeds of its future autonomy were sown by three separate developments: the break down of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates in 1971-73; the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1978, and New Delhis consequent need to go to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for emergency funding, and the external debt crisis of 1990-91.
The first required a constant monitoring of foreign exchange inflows and outflows and the creation of a managed float exchange rate system. The second was made conditional upon a substantial loosening of industrial licensing and import controls. The two together made exchange rate management a key function that automatically devolved upon the RBI. The result was a managed float of the exchange rate which has administered, day by day, by the RBI.
The freedom to print money remained, however, with the finance ministry till the external debt crisis of 1990-91 finally prised open the Indian economy. The switch to a market economy , the opening up of the financial sector to private banking, current account convertibility and the inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign institutional investor (FII) made it imperative to coordinate exchange rates, interest rates and money supply and to regulate the commercial banking sector through monetary signals.
Only the RBI was capable of doing all this. The Narasimha Rao government enshrined this acceptance in an all-important agreement between finance minister Manmohan Singh and RBI governor C. Rangarajan to end the issue of treasury bills by the ministry of finance by 1997 and manage the supply of credit entirely through the RBI in future.
With this, the RBI finally obtained a degree of autonomy comparable, although by no means equal, to that of central banks in the high income market economies.
Ailments and clashes
But this autonomy brought a new problem to the fore. This is the clash between economic growth and price stability. The RBI is required to maintain price and exchange rate stability.
The government was required to promote growth and create employment. But it is an axiom of development economics that rapid growth creates inflationary pressures. Thus, reconciling the two aims requires the closest cooperation between the two.
TCA correctly points out that this balance was best achieved between Bimal Jalan as the governor of the RBI and Yashwant Sinha (followed by Jaswant Singh) as the finance minister.
Their cooperation resulted in a steady reduction of both government administered deposit rates like interest of provident fund and postal savings, and the lending rates of the commercial banks. This re-ignited growth after the five-year recession of 1997 till 2002.
Formally, TCA ends his analysis of the RBIs evolution in 2008 at the end of Y.V. Reddys stewardship of the RBI, because that is where his research materials ended.
Although he skated over the Subba Rao period in just a few pages, he has had nothing to say about Raghuram Rajans three years. This is a pity because it is in these three years that the autonomy of the RBI became absolute and it succeeded in stopping industrial and employment growth in the country.
The doctrine that both used to do this  Subba Rao implicitly, but Rajan explicitly  is inflation targeting, whose central tenet is that high inflation hurts economic growth, and lowering it automatically restores growth. Both therefore made the control of inflation the one-point agenda of the RBI. This doctrine was cock-eyed to start with, but by 2013 so complete was the RBIs dominance over the ministry of finance, that no finance minister in Delhi (Arun Jaitley) has dared to take the RBI governor to task or challenge the theoretical basis of his addiction to high interest rates.
The truth is that inflation targeting is not an economic tool to foster growth but a political tool devised by the richest industrialised countries to enable them to continue living far beyond their shrinking means, by drawing, free of cost, upon the savings of less fortunate countries.
Inflation targeting attained the status of a doctrine  a one-stop cure for all developmental ailments  only when it was adopted by the industrialised countries in the 1990s. Its rationale developed out of Britains exchange rate crisis in 1992.
Britain had been living way beyond its means, with an average inflation rate of 11% and a balance of payments deficit of 8% of the GDP for 20 years from the early seventies. Initially, this caused the pound to depreciate rapidly against the dollar. Then North Sea oil hit the market and the pound recovered till it was once more worth well over two dollars at the end of 1978.
When oil prices crashed in 1986, this underpinning of the pound disappeared. But for six years, the Margaret Thatcher government resisted pressure to devalue the pound, by informally linking it to the Deutsche Mark, and later joining the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) , and raising interest rates to keep attracting foreign savings. This house of cards collapsed on Black Wednesday in 1992, when it was forced to leave the ERM and massively devalue the pound. At that point, inflation had been running at 11% for 20 years, and the balance of payments deficit was 8% of the gross domestic product (GDP).
Devaluation stemmed the outflow, and eventually helped revive British industry. But in its immediate aftermath, it left Britain to face the task of reviving confidence in the future stability of the pound. Inflation targeting was the policy forged by the Bank of England to do this. It was, in effect a declaration to the rest of the world that it could park its money safely in pounds sterling, because the British government would never allow inflation to threaten its stability again.
Not surprisingly, inflation targeting has become the bible of of the industrialised countries, all of whom are facing de-industrialisation, shrinking tax bases and rising welfare bills because of their aeging population.
And it has worked, for Britain has continued to run a balance of payments deficit of 7% of GDP, and has run up a national debt amounting to 90 percent of its GDP. The US has similarly been financing a half-trillion dollar annual balance of payments deficit from foreign savings and now has a national debt verging on 20 trillion dollars  well over twice its GDP.
In India, only Bimal Jalan, as TCA points out, had no time for inflation targeting. Nor, he said would he commit India to maintaining a specific exchange rate.
Instead, he told the Foreign Exchange dealers association,  the declared policy of the RBI is to meet temporary demand-supply imbalances which arise from time to time our our objective is to keep market movements orderly and ensure that there is no liquidity problem or rumour or panic-induced volatility.
The RBIs task therefore, he asserted, was to manage price and exchange rate fluctuations within the framework of policies determined by the elected government of the country, and not to supplant that government in the setting of objectives or making of policy.

Williamson fires  New Zealand to  T20 win over England
WELLINGTON: Captain Kane Williamson silenced his critics with a half century as New Zealand defeated England by 12 runs in the fourth match of the T20 tri-series in Wellington Tuesday, severely denting the tourists' hopes of making the final.
Williamson top-scored with 72 from 46 balls and opener Martin Guptill contributed 65 as the Black Caps battled to a tight victory over England.
The hosts had set a target of 197, and restricted England to 184 for nine in reply.
The result leaves Jos Buttler's men without a win in the series after losses to Australia in their previous two matches.
Buttler put the hosts in after winning the toss, hoping an mottled-looking drop-in pitch with huge bald patches would prove unplayable.
But the gamble backfired as the wicket held up and New Zealand's batsmen finally hit their stride after three straight T20 losses.
The wicket obviously played a lot better than everyone thought and produced a really good game, said Buttler, who was standing in as captain for the injured Eoin Morgan.
Williamson said it was a crucial win for New Zealand, who can seal a spot in the final of the triangular series with a win over Australia on Friday in Auckland.
On a personal note, his captain's knock was also rewarding after he had come under fire for a recent lean spell in the shortest form of the game.

We believe there is an inherent importance of using art to portray the development of our society. Art is there to inspire, to raise questions and to provoke passion. With increasing worldwide interest in South Asian Art, we need to portray the richness of our art to the world. Although Kala Pola is just one event that we use, it has been tremendously successful.
We had 22,000 visitors last year and more than 12 million rupees worth of sales of art at the pola itself. We will also have evening entertainment which will be quite exciting. In addition to being a marketplace, it is a place for networking between artists. It is not just on the Sri Lankan Art Calendar but the regional calendar because we are having so many inquiries from overseas, pointed out Tambiah.
Lucrative opportunities
Tambiah pointed out that we need to show the world the richness of our art since we are Sri Lankans. There is interest definitely. The fine pieces of original art at the Kala Pola are very affordable and available. We are becoming a nation that values our art and that is how it should be.
Chairman, George Keyt Foundation, Michael Anthonisz recalls the first Kala Pola when there were around 30 artists then. Since then it has grown to around 330 more artists.
It is with great honour and pride that we are celebrating and hosting the 25th anniversary of the Kala Pola. We are humbled at the levels of growth and success it has reached and the capacity in which it acts as a platform to support and promote local artists and the lucrative opportunities it provides. We sincerely thank John Keells for its sustained invaluable support over the last two decades, said Anthonisz.
Anthonisz commented that the unique feature of the Kala Pola is that all the art-loving folk get to see a myriad of work of various artists with different styles.
Kala Pola is one of the vibrant social events in the Sri Lankan calendar. In a way, it is a meeting place. It is a cultural event that has come a long way. In the recent years, the whole art scene in Sri Lanka has grown. The large success is due to the Kala Pola. And it has been a great ride. So we have definitely seen a growth in Kala Pola during a period of 25 years, said Anthonisz. Anthonisz pointed out that Kala Pola has a beauty of its own. Art is out on the streets. You can just stroll through the Kala Pola  a centre of art.
Potential investment
People have now realized the potential of investing in art. There is a potential investment value in good art, added Anthonisz.
Artist Sanjeewee Senevirathna is taking part for the 20th time at Kala Pola this year. He participated in his first Kala Pola as a University student.
That marked the beginning in my career as an artist. It was a turning point in my artistic life. That laid the foundation for my exposure to the local clientele. It was also the first time when it became a business for me. Even though I felt a little doubtful initially, I feel that there has been a good response. But I feel that this pola is a good platform for any budding artist. I met a lot of seasoned artists which has done me a load of good. It has more than an economic value to me, said Senevirathna.
Senevirathna also stated that he has had the opportunity to make important connections locally internationally. Yet he maintains that his roots are at Kala Pola. Zamshaya Kaleel felt that Kala Pola has had a positive impact on her life giving her much motivation.
Aspiring artists
It has increased my passion for art. Kala Pola is a fantastic platform for both amateur and professional artists. It is a stepping stone for aspiring artists. It is a fantastic opportunity for us to show our talent. It has many benefits where our work is appreciated, said Kaleel.
Kala Pola is a dream come true for these artists. They get to sell their work, they receive recognition, they get to network amongst themselves and they have a chance of entering the international arena. Drawing inspiration from the infectious and all-pervasive concept of open-air markets in Europe, notable Montmartre in Paris, Kala Pola has been a wonderful display of local talent, one which colours the street with its vibrant hues, bringing together art enthusiasts from all over Sri Lanka and beyond, to the heart of Colombo. At the press conference held last week, there was an issue of a Kala Pola 25th anniversary stamp and first-day cover.
Kala Pola unveils on Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha on February 25, under the distinguished patronage of Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu. It will be held throughout the day from 8 am till 9 pm.

Amazon plans  hundreds of layoffs
Amazon is cutting hundreds of positions at its headquarters and global operations, a reset that comes after several years of significant growth.
The cuts were first reported by the Seattle Times, which said the actions are focused on streamlining the firm's consumer retail business.
Amazon said it is working to offer affected staff new roles.It said it expects "small reductions in a couple of places and aggressive hiring in many others."
Amazon, which lists thousands of job openings on its website, has expanded rapidly in recent years, both through skyrocketing sales and acquisitions of companies such as grocer Whole Foods. The company reported about $3bn in profit on nearly $178bn in sales last year.
It counted more than 560,000 full and part-time workers worldwide at the end of December, an expansion of more than 65% from the previous year.
The firm's website shows many of the new positions report to Amazon Web Services, the firm's profitable cloud computing division.
The firm is also building up units focused on the company's Alexa robot and other devices. Previous consolidations at the company have led to layoffs in some areas.
Last year, Amazon closed Diapers.com and other sites operated by Quidsi, which it announced a deal to acquire in 2010 for about $500m. That led to more than 260 layoffs in New Jersey.

Australia to deport Lankan asylum seeker despite UN objections
A Sri Lankan asylum seeker, who is an LTTE suspect, has been ordered for deportation next week, despite the UN requesting Australia not to move him while it investigates whether he will be tortured if he is returned, the Guardian reported on Monday.
It said the deportation order issued for asylum seeker Shantaruban by the Australian Border Force says he will be deported on February 22.
He will not be permitted any visitors at the airport when he is removed and he will be escorted on his flight to Colombo. He has refused to sign the order.
In October last year, the UN committee against torture issued an interim measure request, formally asking that Australia refrain from returning [Shantaruban] to Sri Lanka while his complaint is under consideration.
Shantaruban has arrived in Australia by boat in 2012. Having been released to live in the community, he was re-detained in 2015 and has remained in immigration detention since.
He fled Sri Lanka fearing repercussions from government security forces for his alleged involvement with the LTTE.
According to the brief before the UN committee, Shantaruban was an active and senior member of the LTTE in particular working as a boat-builder for its naval wing, the Sea Tigers.
The UN, other governments and human rights groups have consistently raised serious concerns over the return of Tamil asylum seekers to Sri Lanka, particularly those with known links to the LTTE, the Guardian reported.
The Sri Lankan government has consistently denied mistreatment is occurring.
Shantarubans claim for protection turns on his association with the LTTE, which has not been considered by Australian authorities.
Several letters attached to Shantarubans submission  including from refugees granted protection in Australia and Sri Lankan members of Parliament  declare that he was a senior member of the LTTE.
But Shantaruban was initially reluctant to reveal his connection to the Tigers when he arrived in Australia seeking asylum because he feared he would face deportation or punishment.
Other former members of the LTTE have declared their association and have had their claims to persecution recognised by the Australian government, the Guardian stated.

Ballpoint point blank
In a well-designed, elegantly produced collection of ballpoint artworks, Chandana Ranaweera has cleverly set his mind and hand to a very modest and surprisingly complex mediumthe ballpoint pen. All artistic devices and materials have their distinguishing features and ranking in the high/low-art continuum, with the ballpoint pen generally rated near the bottom. Its effects tend to be straightforward and relatively un-nuancedit makes mostly solid lines.
The art of Chandana Ranaweera has earned positive commentary from Prof Ashly Halp, Edwin Ariyadasa and Gwen Herath. His work depicts abstracts from the reality around us and images from his own imagination. Chandanas works of art include a unique form of collage. He tears shapes from printed newspapers and takes lengths of discarded ayurvedic prescriptions written on ola leaf and glues them on smallish pieces of drawing paper and then draws on the surface.
Chandana passed on his skills and knowledge to young students at his old school, Rathanalankara Viduhala, Alawwa, where he teaches. His work can be viewed at his rural home Mallika Niwasa in Alawwa.
Artist Chandana Ranaweera uses a unique medium to bring to life many of his themes and concepts  the ballpoint pen. Working within different themes, the artist portrays gods and goddesses in various postures. They are not traditional images of divinity often seen at kovils and temples.
Constantly, influenced by nature, the artist sees trees in clusters and different shapes. He looks at the moon and sees its reflection in the water.
As several of his drawings portray, Ranaweera is also fascinated by traditional drummers and Kavadi dancers. He visits temples and devales  where he invariably sees traditional drummers  in search of material and inspiration for his drawings.
Beginning in 1991, Ranaweera has been holding solo exhibitions of his creations almost annually. Although he could not hold any exhibition abroad, Ranaweera sent his entries to foreign exhibitions held in India, Bangladesh and Japan. Some of his drawings were bought by art lovers in France, England, Singapore and the United States. In 1994, one of his drawings was published by the United Nations. Ranaweera has also won many awards at art competitions held locally.
Chandana divides the work into many categories with mostly pure and geometric abstractions in the first section and faces and figures of all manner in the secondalthough there is some categorical seepage. With his playful lines and abstract cartoons, Ranaweera excels in the first grouping, while he fares well in revealing the pens (and his) expressive and improvisatory potential.

Environment around Bangladesh team dirty - Khaled Mahmud
Bangladesh unlikely to find new coach before Nidahas trophy
Khaled Mahmud is no longer interested in the job of Bangladesh team's technical director, saying the environment around the players has become "dirty".
He made these comments after the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said it was unlikely to find a head coach before the Nidihas Trophy in March.
It is increasingly possible that the current coaching setup will go with the team to the T20 tournament in Sri Lanka considering the board has already rejected Richard Pybus and Phil Simmons' applications for the head coach's position.
Mahmud said Bangladesh's loss in the ODI tri-series final and the Test series has put him under pressure. He claimed he was being unfairly targeted, even though several previous Bangladesh coaches had begun their careers with defeats.
Dav Whatmore, Jamie Siddons and Chandika Hathurusingha had all started their stints poorly.
"Personally I am no longer interested to work with Bangladesh cricket," Mahmud said. "I honestly feel it is becoming very dirty. I have always worked for the development of Bangladesh cricket. There is no self-interest involved [on my part]. But I am no longer interested.
"The board will decide whether I should be going to the Nidihas Trophy. The fact that I am still around after our defeats is the biggest talking point. A lot of big coaches started off with bad results. Bangladesh's performance may be because of our planning but there are more stories."
The only stories he elaborated upon were his gripe with the media and the talk about the Dhaka pitch.
Mahmud questioned the Bangladesh players whom he said were not ready to battle on the spin-friendly track.
"I don't want to give any excuses whether it was a turning wicket or a bouncy track. If I am a player, I should play well in all types of wickets. There's no point using the wickets as an excuse.
"Wasn't the wicket tough for Roshen Silva who was playing only his second Test match He struggled, he fought. We didn't fight. I didn't see that someone struggled for a long time and then got out to a brilliant delivery. It becomes viral when people start talking about the wicket," he said.
Mahmud said that they had prepared well in advance to play on spin-friendly pitches, and reiterated that Sri Lanka's lack of experience meant that they could have been easily countered in home conditions.
"Everyone knew how the wicket would play at least 15-20 days ahead. We were unlucky in Chittagong where the wicket didn't play as it should have. If we could play against Australia on a turning wicket, so is Sri Lanka God
"What do the Sri Lankans have that we can't play against them They only had Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva. How many Tests have they played"

Benjamin Netanyahu: Israeli police recommend indicting prime minister

Israeli police have recommended thatBenjamin Netanyahube indicted on charges of bribery and breach of trust, in an embarrassing blow that has thrown the prime ministers political future in doubt.
Following a 14-month investigation into two cases of alleged corruption, the countrys attorney general will examine the evidence and then  possibly in several months time  decide whether to indict.
The country has been anxiously waiting for the prosecutors recommendation, which local media has speculated could force the prime minister to resign.
A police statement late on Tuesday said that enough evidence had been gathered against the prime minister for committing the crimes of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust.
Minutes after the news of the police report spread across Israeli media, Netanyahu held a press conference in Jerusalem, vehemently denying any wrongdoing and dismissing rumours that he would step down.
He said the development was the latest in a long list of endeavours to remove him from government. All these attempts end up with nothing because I know the truth. I tell you, also this time, things will end up with nothing.
I will continue to leadIsraelresponsibly and faithfully, he said, adding he plans to run in elections that must be held by the end of next year.
Police have questioned Netanyahu several times at his official residence in Jerusalem during the past few months regarding thetwo cases in which he is a suspect.
Case 1000, or the so-calledgifts affair, involves claims that he and his family received valuable gifts from international billionaires, including expensive cigars, pink champagne and jewellery for his wife.
Alleged wealthy benefactors include the Hollywood producer and media magnate Arnon Milchan as well as the Australian businessman James Packer.
In a statement, police said Netanyahu had accepted gifts valued at 750,000 shekels (150,000, $208,300) from Milchan, and 250,000 shekels (or 51,000, $70,822) from Packer. In return, Netanyahu had helped Milchan, a producer who has worked on Pretty Woman and Fight Club, on US visa matters and Israeli tax breaks.
Separately, case 2000 relates tosecret talks with the publisher of a leading Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, in which Netanyahu allegedly requested positive coverage in exchange for damaging a competitor, the pro-Netanyahu freesheet Israel Hayom.
Police said both Milchan and Mozes could be charged with bribery. Neither made an immediate comment.
Having ruled for close to 12 years during four terms, the 68-year-old leader heads a delicately balanced coalition that keeps him in power.
The former prime minister and Netanyahu political rival Ehud Barak called on Netanyahu to suspend himself and for the coalition to choose a replacement.
The depth of corruption is horrifying, Barak said. This does not look like nothing. This looks like bribery.
A poll by the local Channel 10 found last summer that 66% of Israelis believed the premier should resign if indicted. Weekly demonstrations over the slow pace of the investigations have also added pressure on officers to submit a recommendation.
Last week, the investigation was plunged into controversy when the police commissioner, Inspector General Roni Alsheich, suggested the prime minister had sent private investigators to collect information against police officers investigating him.
Netanyahus office said the outlandish allegations threw a shadow over the corruption investigation. Any honest person would ask himself how people who say such delusional things about the prime minister can objectively investigate him and honestly give unbiased recommendations, his Facebook page said.
On Tuesday evening, the tourism minister, Yariv Levin, suggested the police were attempting to overthrow Netanyahu.
This despicable move revealed tonight is an effort to stage a coup against the will of the voter, Levin says.

Bird out of S. Africa tour
SYDNEY, Tuesday: Paceman Jackson Bird was Tuesday ruled out of Australia's Test squad for South Africa with a hamstring injury and replaced by fellow speedster Chadd Sayers.
Bird pulled his hamstring while bowling in a domestic match in Brisbane last weekend and is expected to be sidelined for up to three weeks, opening the door for the uncapped Sayers.
"It's disappointing for Jackson, but it is exciting for Chadd at the same time," Australian captain Steve Smith said.
"It's kind of a like for like sort of bowler, they're pretty similar. They both stand the seam up nicely and Chadd's been rewarded for what he has done in Shield cricket over the last couple of years, which is great."
Sayers was the leading wicket-taker in the Sheffield Shield last season with 62 victims.
"He's a difficult one (to face)," Smith added. "Because he is so short not many balls go over the stumps, which makes him a pretty handy proposition when the ball is seaming around. I think it is a good selection."
Sayers joins fellow quicks Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazelwood, Pat Cummins and Jye Richardson for the four-Test South Africa series which kicks off on March 1.

Brain drain Vs brain gain
None of the election agendas have foreseen the danger of brain drain in Sri Lanka. There is no single parliamentarian who came up with sustainable solution until to date to the brain drain silently happening in Sri Lanka. Time need to decide whether we need parliamentarians with at least the basic degree with a value system. The need of the hour is to make a future for the children in Sri Lanka.
The future of Sri Lanka is uncertain for the future generation. Still the schools in plantation sector do not have access to quality value based education. We believe in equity in education which is still not realistic in some areas. They are various forms of uncertainties that structure futures. The impact from geopolitical events at the macro structural level factors emphasizes the need for policymakers to deeply reflect on and integrate change as a constant in policy making in education. Its scenarios impact traditional understandings of human capital development and raise the need for systems to prepare students and future citizens for new, alternate, and uncertain economies and radically changed societies.
Change is the only constant in life  Heraclitus
Countries in Southeast Asia are diverse in their educational capacities and face inherent realities of widespread geographical and demographic differences. To improve educational outcomes organisational structure and political economy, teaching and learning, curriculum, assessment learning environment matters a lot. Singapore, Malaysia upgrade, revises their curriculums in every three years. There is no elitism in professions such as law, medicine, and engineering.
All the professions are made for people and best practitioner is a good community leader. With the changes in global education landscape it is essential to introduce new subjects without removing old subjects such as international Humanitarian Law, cyber crimes, western classics, intellectual property rights etc into the undergraduate curricula of law. At present students are searching for astronomy, aeronautical engineering, aircraft building, space science where our system of education has not even thought of. In lapse of these initiatives students are leaving the country in search of such studies in foreign universities. Absolutely very few are returning.
Trickledown effect to all the provinces equally
We need competent graduates with value based education to compete with other countries and to be good community leaders. There is a huge gap between the subjects taught in Advanced Level examination and the undergraduate curricula. Further, the gap needs to be bridged in a way that assists to enhance thinking capacity of the child. Therefore, such changes are required in our system of education. All the new efforts should have trickledown effect to all the provinces equally.
The relevance of certain curriculum is questionable after ten years time as they have not attempted any upgrading especially in the higher education, Sri Lanka. Alignment with national socio-economic development and the future economy is further questionable.
There is a necessity to consider strategies that improve learning quality and the measurement of teaching learning outcomes. This is effective when all young children in each province have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education, higher education as well as vocational education equally.
Technological universities
A true change in recent times, one of the most important changes to occur in favour of most Sri Lankan children who have the talent of doing apart from knowing or theoretical knowledge, is the introduction of technology subjects stream to the GCE (A/L) curriculum. More funding arrangements were made without thinking of existing pool of teachers to teach at secondary level to facilitate entry of technological stream in each province.
It would have beneficial of developing one or two technological universities than introducing technological stream considering the funds used without adequate resource backing from the secondary sector.
Quality of education relies on more access to education where technology stream is a dream for some of the provinces where most of the day has been covered with dark clouds even without sunrays in some provinces. The expected student outcome will not be reached without filling teacher requirement in all schools equally to facilitate technology stream.
There are no constructive debates are happening in the parliament regarding the future generation of Sri Lanka. Waves of changes are taking place in the global higher education sector in Sri Lanka. National think tank need to be formed to prepare and implement action plans in higher education.

Brexit to happen three months earlier
It appears Britain will pull out of the European Union three months earlier than expected. Negotiators on both sides of the tricky deal have reportedly agreed to an official divorce date of 31 December 2020.
A government source has told the Sun: "The EU timetable is the working assumption and no one seems too upset by that."
The British Prime Minister originally wanted a transition period of 'around two years' after the 29 March 2019 date, but it's reported officials are happier with a 21-month grace period.
Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, told reporters that a shorter transition time would be beneficial to both parties and would be 'useful for Britain to get prepared for the kind of challenges they will face... and for the new relationship'.
He adds that UK businesses will still have access to the single market but still must adhere to its obligations and duties of their shared policies.
Barnier ominously warned British companies to 'start preparing for this right now'.
One area where this will be beneficial to the UK is fishing.
According to the Times, the industry will be exempt from the official transition period rules, meaning Britain doesn't have to wait until the end of 2020 to shake hands on a new deal.
But there is still a cloud hanging over the banking sector and its future.
Theresa May says it should have a special deal in the ongoing Brexit negotiations, with a government spokesperson telling the Sun: "We're confident of negotiating a deep and special economic partnership that will include a good deal for financial services."
Barnier poured cold water over that ideation, speaking to the Guardian: "There is no place [for financial services]. There is not a single trade agreement that is open to financial services. It doesn't exist."
He adds any deal that the UK should want to pursue is the one that Canada, South Korea and Japan have with the EU.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer Phillip Hammond is launching a bid this week to ensure France doesn't headhunt City bankers. He'll be visiting Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and Norway to outline their Brexit vision.
The Daily Express says France is trying to turn Paris into the new financial hub of the European Union in the wake of Britain leaving.
Theresa May is due to give a speech this week, explaining how she envisions the UK will have a relationship with the EU post-Brexit.

Bronze dazzle
Temple bronzes produced under the Chola dynasty of South India is considered as one of the most outstanding works of the world. During the period the art of bronze casting reached a height unparalleled in the world. It is said that bronze art during the Chola period reached its peak, especially during the reign of Raja I and Rajendra II. The Cholas captured power in the 9th century in Tamil Nadu and their power lasted till the 13th century.
During their rule, they not only confined their power within South India but also expanded their rule to other neighbouring countries including Sri Lanka, Vietnam and South East Asia region. They ruled from their kingdom in Thanjavur and also maintained good diplomatic ties with Burma, China and Malaysia.
Sculptural representation
They gave patronage to numerous arts, literature, and poetry and built many stone temples with the excellent sculptural representation of Gods and dancing figures. For the purpose of worship, they installed numerous Bronze sculptures. Inside the temples, permanent stone sculptures were installed especially at the sanctum. Immovable stone images were installed inside the temple. The sculptures of the Chola period never failed to prove the exceptional mastery in the skill of the sculptors of that period. Numerous aspects of mastery in artistic skills were well displayed in the Chola period sculptural creations. Attractive figures, delicate moulding and technical sophistication played a pre-eminent position in their bronze creativity. The bronze sculptures of deities and Hindu saints of Chola period were created for the worship purposes.
The Chola period bronze sculptures were divided into three main schools. They are the Aditya, the Sembiyan Mahadevi and Raja Raja schools. The Aditya Chola period existed from 875 A.D to 906 A.D and his son Parantaka whose period lasted from 906 A.D to 955 A.D. During their period, both of them built numerous majestic temples. At these temples, they installed beautiful bronze sculptures with perfect ornamental and costume decorations. Dancing image of Lord Siva is often seen in the form of Nataraja.
A Chola Queen named Sembiyan Mahadevi who was one the great Saiva devotees built numerous temples and installed several sculptural images of Hindu deities in the temples. Another noteworthy fact should be mentioned here is while casting the bronze sculptures, sculptors originally carved the sculptures with costume and ornamental decorations. Even such a factor was mentioned in 10th-century inscriptions.
Worshipping images
The mould of the sculpture is made out of wax. While moulding the bronze Hindu deities numerous rituals were performed at each stage of their creative process. The last stage of making deities is the eye placing ceremony. In the Hindu religious tradition stone and metal images are supposed to be used for the worship. These worshipping images are supposed to receive daily offerings. And on the auspicious and festival days special poojas are offered to them. Even these bronze images are taken out for temple processions and festivals. Hindus believe that priests invoke the deities to descend from a state of abstraction which enters into the immovable stone image enshrined in the sanctum.
Hindu bronze sculptures of Chola period represent a distinctive contribution to the world. It is generally said that most of the deities were traditionally made with copper. Generally, the deities were made with copper, brass, zinc, gold and silver with wax. According to Hindu philosophy, the human body is believed to be composed of five important elements, namely earth, water, fire, sky and air. These elements are collectively called Pancha Bothams. The five metals used in making the images are known as iyempon or Pancha Lokas (the statue made out of five metallic factors).
The Hindu Gods made out of five lokas (metals) are called Pancha Loka Murthis. Large bronze images were made for the purposes to take out in the temple processions. These bronze made statues of the temple deities are used for daily rituals, temple festival and festival processions. In the idol worship, these sculptures are wrapped with expensive material and they were further adorned with flower garlands and jewellery.

Canny canines farming tricks
Rambo the Golden Retriever attracts a stream of visitors to his home where he rides on a red Massey Ferguson tractor wearing a hi-viz vest in in County Down, Northern Ireland.
The hard-working dog has helped his master mow lawns, plough fields, cut down corn, and trim hedges.
The six-year-old dog is also the father of four puppies.
Rambo's owner, Albert Reid, said: "Nobody could believe it, when they saw it. They had to take photographs and video him.
"We have people that come to our yard who are just lost for words when they see him do his tricks, he is such a good dog as well. He is just too friendly and so welcoming with all the people that come round."
Albert is keen to show off his extremely talented dog and constantly puts Rambo's skills to the test.
Albert, 66, added: "He is a fantastic dog.
"I put him up on the tractor and then the dog will start his work from there. He has such a great temperament as well.
There were these two children and one of the girls who was with her granny and granddad was really scared of the dogs. The granny and granddad went to walk around the yard and when they came back the little girl was sitting there with her arms around Rambo.
Retired lorry driver, Albert Reid, noticed his dog had these amazing talents since he was a puppy and said he has always been a helping hand for him.
"From a pup I just told him to sit there and I went out around the yard and he would just sit there and watch me. He helps me out a lot and he is good company to have. On a Saturday morning he will sit at the back of my Land Rover for hours waiting for me to go somewhere. He goes everywhere with me and everyone says 'whenever I see you, your always with that dog'.
But there is one talent Rambo can't seem to get the hang of.
Albert, of County Down, Northern Ireland said: "He will sit and wait by my car but will never jump in himself. I always have to lift him into my car.
"His tail will go round like a helicopter because he will be so excited. But he just can't get himself to jump into my car for some reason." Mirror
