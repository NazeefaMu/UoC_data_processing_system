England are not world beaters yet
Smiling supporters were cracking open the champagne on Saturday night but if England are to win the World Cup again, now - this week - is the time to be hyper-critical on and off the field, because they are not world-beaters yet.
The World Cup is three years away and all the teams arrive fully loaded and prepared, which we just haven't seen from the Southern Hemisphere teams this autumn.
England have been tigerish, skilful, resilient, snarling and bloody-minded in recent times
Winning teams crack the whip in victory even more than in defeat and analyse why they are winning, always trying to raise the bar inch by inch in every part of their game. Everybody in the England camp will know that if that had been New Zealand on Saturday the game would have been lost after 20 minutes.
I can guarantee you Eddie Jones won't have glossed over that when he went through his game reviews on Sunday and he will be equally hard on his coaching team on Sunday in their big end-of-autumn debrief.
I trust the RFU will take their cue and do likewise. Instead of patting themselves on the back and reflecting on four lucrative autumn sell-outs at Twickenham, the RFU should be asking themselves what on earth was going on before the appointment of Eddie just over a year ago. Why and how did they mess up so spectacularly
Why were two totally inexperienced coaches at this level - Martin Johnson and Stuart Lancaster - appointed to the biggest job in world rugby and left steering the ship between 2008 and 2015 with little or no real help or guidance - an era when England should have been just as strong and competitive on the world stage as they are now.
This is not a criticism of Johnno or Lancaster, the complete opposite. The question is for those who put them in those positions. They were asked to do a job they were not qualified for at that stage of their careers. They put body and soul into it but they were the wrong appointments at the time and they enjoyed precious little behind-the-scenes support which their inexperience demanded.
That awful failing of the system should not be glossed over by Ian Ritchie on Monday morning. He appointed Lancaster. Why If Eddie is prepared to pick apart England's wins on the pitch - which he does constantly - Ritchie should, at the very least, do likewise off the pitch and document England's failures. Because this must never happen again.
Right, that's the reality check over! Having done that let's also take a moment here to congratulate this group of England players and coaches who have worked so hard to restore the pride in English rugby. They have been tigerish, skilful, resilient, brave, occasionally brilliant, snarling and bloody-minded when needed and totally committed.
And they have become a calm team, which is always the sign of a maturing team. Even when they were under the pump in that opening quarter on Saturday and it could easily have gone horribly wrong, I looked around and saw a team who were still together and not panicking.
They kept tackling and battling and bought themselves time and the opportunity to get back into the game.
I have loved watching England in 2016 and am massively excited about the future because they have only just scratched the surface - especially in attack where I am not sure they even realise how potent and dangerous they can and must become. And there is a conveyor belt of talent coming through that will challenge and refresh this group and keep the edge that fierce competition for places brings.
There are options and exciting possibilities everywhere and I genuinely believe that this, finally, is going to be the start of a new golden era for England.
World rugby needs a strong England team, and at last we can say it has one.

Fourteen contempt of court petitions filed against Lankaenews
A lawyer yesterday filed 14 Contempt of Court petitions in the Supreme Court against editor of Lankaenews website Sandaruwan Senadheera seeking the Courts jurisdiction to take steps to punish him for allegedly publishing defamatory articles which appeared in Lankaenews defaming the judges from the Apex Court to the Magistrates Court castigating their character.
These 14 complaints had been filed by former Deputy Mayor of Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte Municipal Council, attorney-at-law Madura Vithanage complaining that there had been a series of articles published and appeared in the social media web site/face book named Lankaenews in which the judges and the Judicial Institutions had been critically ridiculed and intimidated and at certain instances there had been scathing attacks on judges commencing from Magistrates to the Chief Justice.
The complainant stated that through the contents of the said articles the web site/face book owner/operator has insulted, defamed, and ridiculed the judges whose names are referred to therein and there is direct and indirect intimidation on judges as well as the judiciary as a whole.
In his petitions, the petitioners cited lankaenews editor Sandaruwan Senadheera as the accused and the Attorney General and the President of Bar Association of Sri Lanka as respondents.
The petitioner is requesting the Court to charge the accused on the offence of contempt of the Supreme Court under Article 105(3) of the constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka and grant an order restraining the accused preventing him from publishing further Contemptuous statements/articles scandalizing the judges or any judicial institution including Supreme Court and the Judicial Services Commission until the conclusion of this case.
These articles have attacked on both the judicial conduct as well as the private lives of the judges and caused embarrassment not only to the judges but also to the entire judiciary, the complainant said.
The complainant stated that Lankaenews is a web site owned and maintained by Sandaruwan Senadheera from London, United Kingdom.
He further stated that the contents in the said articles are derogatory of the judiciary and the judges and tantamount to contempt of court punishable under law.

China a special friend of Sri Lanka - Rajitha
The long standing friendship between China and Sri Lanka is strengthened day by day and China has already assisted Sri Lanka's development process significantly, Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne said.

South Africa is going to be a tough challenge - Mathews
South Africa is definitely on a role and currently playing their best cricket having beaten Australia 2-1 in Australia, but Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews is confident that if his team can get their processes right and play to their potential they could beat anyone. South Africa is going to be tough challenge for us. Most of the teams do well and win at home and they struggle overseas. It happens to any team but we want to try and achieve some wins overseas and turn the tables around, Mathews told the *Daily News*. The Sri Lanka team leaves for South Africa
today on a two-month tour.
I am confident that my team can do it. We got a good combination where we have five fast bowlers and two experienced spinners and a solid batting order. Unfortunately we couldnt take (Asela) Gunaratne and (Niroshan) Dickwella but that is a good headache to have. We want all of them fighting for their spot and its upto all of us to go out there and do our best for the country, Mathews continued.
Our main objective is to win the Test, ODI and T20 series, but we are not looking too far ahead but take one game at a time. We want to play really good competitive cricket and stick to our basics. If we do our processes right as I always said and if we give our 100 percent and play to our potential we can beat anyone.
Zimbabwe and South Africa are completely different teams this is going to be a much bigger challenge for us as a team. We are not taking anything away from the boys for the hard work they put in Zimbabwe but this is going to be a tougher tour.
Weve been training very hard especially the Test squad who were in Sri Lanka for the past one month or so. The ODI guys had a little bit of rest and they have started training as well. The preparation has been good but the main challenge is going to be getting used to the conditions over there and getting used to the wickets. If we play to our potential I am pretty sure that we can beat South Africa, he said.
Mathews was of the view that to achieve that, the batters must put enough runs on the board.
If we can give our bowlers a chance by putting the runs on the board our bowlers have not let us down. With the bowling attack weve got we have some really experienced bowlers, said Mathews. With Dushmantha Chameera coming back into the team and young Nipun Sanjaya earning his spot in the Test team we got a fairly decent pace attack which can put them under pressure, but we need to score runs as a batting unit. Its going to be our main challenge the boys have worked extremely hard in the past few weeks.
Mathews sees the bounce the South African pitches will offer as the main obstacle for his batsmen. To overcome that the Lankan team has been practicing on a piece of granite to get that extra bounce.
The pace the boys are used to its just that the bounce and the conditions that we need to get used to. We used a lot of granite stuff especially the batters. We prepared wickets slightly harder and with a little bit of grass which has a lot of carry. Weve done everything possible to try and counter attack the South African fast bowlers and get used to their conditions, explained Mathews. Sri Lankan conditions are much different to what you find in South Africa. We have about 12 days before we play our first Test match on Boxing Day. Well try and use those days to the maximum so that we get things right.
When you use a piece of granite the ball is coming on to you quicker. The granite is laid down on the pitch and you can throw the ball on it so that it comes on quicker. Most of the teams do that. Our wickets are such it doesnt have much bounce the only option to get bounce and pace is to use granite.
Sizing up the opposition they are bound to encounter Mathews said, South Africa has been playing really good cricket in the past few months beating Australia in Australia which is never an easy task but they managed to do that. But this is a new series and both teams are starting from zero. The team that plays better cricket and that does less mistakes will come out victorious.
Mathews credited the South African teams success is due to them having a settled team. The South African team looks pretty much the same except for one or two changes they are pretty much a settled team for the past 4-5 years. Theyve been going with the same sort of players maximum 20. Yes, they have lost games here and there but they managed to stick with the same combination and same players and managed to get the maximum out of them. Chopping and changing the team is not going to help them in the longer run.
They have managed a set combination and now the results are showing. The settled combination is the one that has led to their success today. If you look at all the top teams they are pretty much settled. Thats a good thing we can also take from. We are now doing the same we talked about it a lot.
The solution is not to chop and change but be patient with the players and pursue with them to get the maximum out of them going forward. Following the retirement of several seniors Mathews is saddled with a team that is in the process of rebuilding with several new faces but he is extremely happy the way the team has started to jell. It feels great. It all started from the Australian series, when you win its always good and when you lose its a bit difficult on most occasions. All the pressure is on you. Thats the nature of the game but the team has stuck together, stuck to our plans together and thats all that matters, said Mathews. We are all the time helping each other. The seniors are playing a massive role in helping out the youngsters and they are also throwing a lot of ideas onto the table. Its been a collective effort from the seniors and the younger players.

Buttler optimistic despite Indias strong reply
MUMBAI, Frida: Jos Buttler believes England are in a strong position despite Indias impressive start to their innings on the second day of the fourth Test in Mumbai on Friday.
The right-handed batsman notched a splendid 76 at Mumbais Wankhede Stadium to propel England to a commanding first innings score of 400 before India finished day two at 146 for one.
India started their reply positively with Murali Vijay hitting an unbeaten 70 and Cheteshwar Pujara batting on 47 as the pair recorded the highest partnership of the Test so far with 107.
However, Buttler insisted England had the upper hand.
Those two guys (Vijay and Pujara) played very well for India but we still lead by 250, the 26-year-old told reporters.
If we can be a bit more consistent and when we build the pressure theres definitely wicket-taking balls on that surface. Buttler has only recently returned to the England Test side after a year out but said hed benefited from some thinking time during his spell on the sidelines.
Middle-order batsman Buttler was a late call-up for the third Test in Mohali, having last played for England in October 2015.
Buttler started the day on 18, reaching 64 at lunch as England put on 385-8 in a Test that they must win to keep the five-match series alive. He outlasted Ben Stokes, who became Ravichandran Ashwins fifth scalp of the innings when India successfully appealed a not out decision.
The left-hander was dismissed for 31 when the TV umpire ruled that the ball had nicked his bat before dropping into the hands of Virat Kohli.
Ashwins fellow spinner Ravindra Jadeja then grabbed the wickets of Chris Woakes (11), who was caught behind by wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel, and Adil Rashid, who made only four.
Ashwin took his wicket haul to six when Jake Ball was caught on 31. Jadeja then grabbed his fourth wicket of the innings by bowling Buttler.

Stamping out organised corruption may help reduce budget deficit: President
Stamping out organised corruption in some leading government establishments may help reduce the budget deficit, President Maithripala Sirisena said. The President was addressing the National Summit on Anti-corruption 2016 yesterday.
Unfortunately, there is an organised corruption network operating within government establishments. There is not much talk about organised corruption, the President said. I shall not in public name a certain institute or a department for being corrupt. If I do, they might start protesting against me for making such a statement, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
When we try to introduce corruption prevention measures such as CCTV cameras in some of these departments, the bribe takers protest or resort to strikes. We have to ask ourselves how socially degenerated we are to support a corruption network. I was reported that one time, an administrative officer, who received a transfer to a new department, was prevented from performing his duties as he did not support the internal corruption network adopted by the department workers. He was isolated for more than one and a half years at his work place, as he did not support their organized corruption, the President said.
We, as a country, also have a disreputable history when it comes to political heads using and manipulating public commissions and government establishments for political purposes, President Sirisena pointed out.
If we take our national income into consideration, I believe that we can increase it if we can prevent serious fraud and corruption taking place in some of the leading government establishments in the country. Preventing corruption in these institutes will bring a larger income to the government with which we can reduce our budget deficit.
Therefore, it is the responsibility of the heads of these establishments to rid their respective institutions of corruption. I propose the government institutes to hold anti-corruption meetings thrice a month at their respective institutes. Such a meeting will become an anti-corruption sangayanava against the corruption networks, President Sirisena added.
Referring to a speech made at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute recently, the President said that he faced strong criticism from certain groups for making such a speech. However, I still abide by my statement, the President added.
What matters is that all law enforcement agencies should operate unbaised. No investigation can be zeroed upon only by a certain group or persons. We expect the independent commissions to be impartial as I pointed out in that speech. President Sirisena said.
President Maithripala Sirisena further said that the objective of a National Summit on Anti-Corruption is to educate politicians, government officials and the public on the importance of anti-corruption as a concept.
Giving a bribe is as wrong as receiving one, he said. Therefore, the public should also keep in mind not to encourage bribe takers, the President further added.
President Sirisena also said that some government heads are reluctant to carry out some of their duties for fear of having to appear before law enforcing agencies such as the FCID.
Not only government officials, I am reported that even some ministers have refused to work on some files saying that they dont want to appear before the FCID. In a way, this fear is a vaild point.
The fear to do wrong shows the awareness campaign carried out by the government against corruption is showing results. However,political leaders and government heads should fulfill their responsibilities to society with less or no corruption.

Hambantota Port to be made joint venture with private company
The government will convert the Hambantota Port into a joint venture with a private company to make it an income generating enterprise while retaining its ownership, Development Strategy and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrema said in a statement yesterday.
The objective of the government is to make the Hambantota Port an income generating enterprise, while retaining its ownership and leasing it on a 99-year lease agreement, the statement said. The government has to utilize correct and timely long-term strategies to liberate the country from the economic crisis and achieve economic development on a correct path.
One method is to re-structure businesses and enterprises which sustain economic losses. Accordingly the government will have to re-structure loss-making businesses and enterprises through agreements with local and foreign entrepreneurs. Otherwise people will have to incur debt payments for certain State institutions that have huge losses. Our country has fruitful experience of re-structuring such institutions in the past.
It is in this background that the Government has taken steps to convert the Hambantota Port into a joint venture with a private company belonging to the Chinese government. It is a joint concern entered into with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority has earned an income of Rs. 32,202 million from January to October 31, 2015. Of it 91.15% has been earned from the Colombo Port. However, this income had to be allocated for the maintenance of the Hambantota Port and to pay its debts. The maintenance expenses of the Hambantota Port during that period amounted to Rs.2,597 million. In addition Rs. 8482 had been paid as debt instalments and interest. However, the total income from the Hambantota Port during the relevant period was only Rs. 1,730 million. Thus every citizen of the country has a debt burden of Rs.10,000 for the Hambantota Port alone. The only strategy to salvage the Hambantota Port is to make it an income generating enterprise. The government has undertaken a correct economic strategy to fulfill that responsible task. Accordingly the objective of the government is to make the Hambantota Port an income generating enterprise retaining its ownership and leasing it on a 99-year lease agreement. Another objective is to convert it from the present position of a White Elephant to a prime commercial center of the economy. The target of the present government is to make this port a center of active economic operations by converting it as a hub connecting the East and the West and as an entry point into the Sri Lankan economy. It is genuine task aimed at sustainable economic development of the country. It is not an attempt to sell the Hambantota Port to a foreign country or a betrayal of the country, as some allege.

Japanese ship prevented from leaving for four days
The Hyperion Highway, a Japanese-owned container ship carrying 7,000 vehicles bound for the Middle East and Europe, has been prevented from leaving the Hambantota Port for four days by disgruntled shipping trade union workers.
The workers are not letting the ship leave. They have positioned forklifts so that it is impossible to untie the ropes and unmoor the ship. They have also lowered gantry cranes to ensure the ship cannot leave, said Tressel Silva, operations manager for ABC Shipping, the agent for K Line, the shipping outfit that owns the Hyperion Highway.
Hyperion Highway, a car carrier vessel belonging to Kawasaki Group of Japan berthed at Hambantota harbor on December 6 and completed operations on December 7.
Its next port of call is Sohar Port in Oman and the ship is scheduled to arrive there by December 11. The vessel is taken hostage by the union workers after the operation was completed on December 7.
The vessel cannot sail as Gantry Cranes are blocking its path out of the channel and there is no pilot and tug boats to guide the vessel out of the Port.
The protesters attempted to climb to the vessel using ropes yesterday evening.
The delays have cost the shipping company around 200,000 dollars so far, and there is a possibility that the company will have to pay penalties due to the fact that it will deliver the shipments behind schedule.
The union workers complaints reportedly stem from the signing of a public-private partnership between the Sri Lankan government and the China Merchants Group that transfers an 80% stake in the Hambantota port to the Chinese state-owned company.
The workers are purportedly upset that the deal stipulates that they will soon be transferred to the payroll of the Chinese company instead of that of the Magam Ruhunupura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port.
Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga met with union representatives and said that he was unable to stop the transfer of workers to the Chinese company. He did guarantee, however, that nobody would lose his or her job.
There have been reports that union members have pelted the ship with stones and restricted access to the ship with barbed wire. A number of protesters reportedly continue to occupy space near the vessel.
Two other container ships that are currently outside the port will most likely be rerouted to Singapore or Indian ports due to the ongoing situation.
The Navy has been called in to remedy the situation and is now guarding the stranded vessel.
We are lending our support and protecting the ship, Navy Media Spokesperson Captain Akram Alavi said.
Representatives from ABC Shipping are upset about the slow response by the Ministry of Ports and Shipping.
We have gotten very little support from the Ministry of Ports and Shipping. This crisis has gone on too long, and it will likely hurt the Sri Lankan shipping business in the future, ABC Shipping Executive Director Roshan Dissanayake said.
Meanwhile, Sea Port Employees Committee and Propaganda Secretary Vice Chairman I.K.Omesh said that the employees have served the institution for a period of four and a half years under the
Magampura sea port project.
Speaking at a press conference in Hambantota last evening, he said that the employees were trained by the Sri Lanka Port Authority.
He said that the sea port will be vested with a Chinese firm and then their jobs will be lost. He said that they are not prepared to work under a man power company as employees who have served the institution for a period of four and half years.
Omesh said that wild rumours are being spread that the sea port employees have come under the influence of an invisible political force to stage this protest.
While totally denying this allegation, he stressed that the only motive behind their protest was to protect their jobs in order to lead self reliant lives with their children and parents.
He said that there are two ships at the sea port and that the activities of these ships that have arrived from China and Singapore have come to a standstill as a result of the protest campaign. He further said that these ships have been anchored for the past three days. He said last night naval officers tried to move the ships from the sea port but failed due to the obstructions placed by the protesters.
He urged President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to intervene and settle the matter because the Ports Minister seems has so far failed to settle the dispute.

Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga yesterday said that neither the President nor the Prime Minister requested him to sack employees attached to the Hambantota Port.
Refuting allegations by Hambantota district parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa that the Prime Minister has given instructions to sack employees attached to the port, Ranatunga said the government has not taken any decision to terminate their services.
We could have sacked more than 500 port employees who canvassed for the former President during the last presidential election. But the President or the Prime Minister has never taken such a decision.He said Rajapaksa had enrolled over 200 employees to the port but no one was sacked.

If traders try to create an artificial rice shortage during the upcoming Christmas and Sinhala and Tamil New Year festive seasons, rice will be imported to control the prices, Rural Economic Affairs Minister P.Harrison said.
He made this comment in Parliament yesterday responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake under Standing Order 23 (2).
The minister said the Agriculture Department has informed that the rice stocks available in the country as of today would be sufficient until April next year.
However, there is a possibility that intermediates create an artificial rice shortage in the market. If there was such an attempt during the Christmas season or Sinhala and Tamil New Year seasons, we will take measures to import 5,000-10,000 Metric Tonnes of Nadu rice to control the prices at Rs.50-60. We assure the consumers that they will not face any shortage of rice in the market, the minister said.
He said the Cabinet recently took a decision not to release the available stocks of paddy at once, but to release them in stages as there is an expected drop in the harvest due to inadequate rainfall.
The harvest is going to be not more that 20 percent of the total, he said. He added a Committee comprising of five Ministry Secretaries including the Finance Ministry Secretary and Agriculture Ministry Secretary has been appointed as of the guidance of the President and the Prime Minister to come up with a new system when selling the paddy to rice mills. As of that system, small and medium scale rice mills will be revived, he said.
