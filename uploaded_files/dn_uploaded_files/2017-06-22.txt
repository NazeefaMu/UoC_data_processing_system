Rowing success!
Pain and suffering are a part of an experience in most sports yet the sport of rowing takes things to a new level. It is an endurance sport and winning comes from hard training. You have to sweat a lot and work your way through thick and thin to pick up the medals.
Hashen Hettigoda has overcome the odds and won accolades in this field. He had represented Sri Lanka at the Asian Junior Rowing Championship held in Yilan, Taiwan, in 2014 and was ranked eighth place in the Asian Junior under 18 category. He clinched gold medals in the Under 19 Scull and the Under 19 Quad Scull at the Head of Bay Regatta held in Hong Kong this year. He has also won Scull second place and Double Scull first place at the ARAE Regatta held in India recently. Hashen has taken part in the Rutherglen Regatta held in Melbourne, Australia, in 2016 and had won Open Eight Second place and Open Four third place. He bagged the Double Scull first place and Coxed Four first place at the Madras-Colombo Regatta 2016. He won the Asian Junior Under 18 13th rank at the Asian Junior Rowing Championship held in Pattaya, Thailand, in 2016. Hashen has even represented Sri Lanka in the Asian Junior Rowing Development Camp organized by the International Rowing Federation and Asian Rowing Federation held in Taiwan in 2014 and the Madras-Colombo Regatta held in Sri Lanka in 2014.
I got into rowing when I was 12 years old. I was the fat kid in the class. One of my friends uncles was the college rowing coach at that time. He spotted me and asked me to come for a session. I tried my hand at the sport and found that I am a natural at it. Team spirit made me stay and continue with it. Since then I have never looked back, Hashen said with a smile.
Rowing is an excellent form of exercise, not only because it is good for your health, but also because it can be done solo or as a team to build teamwork. There is something both relaxing and motivating about being on the water. Once you learn the proper technique, rowing can offer a tremendous amount of physical health benefits, including increased power and strength. Most people see rowing as a high end sport in Sri Lanka. The equipment is expensive. The smallest boat costs over Rs 1.5 million. Unless you have a good sponsor it is difficult to get into the sport.
Therefore only a few schools have taken up the sport. However as the years have flown by many more have turned to rowing. There are about 15 schools and three forces and two universities engaged in rowing, the Captain of the Royal College Rowing Crew 2017 added.
He notes that many foreigners have visited the isle to train the coaches on the techniques of rowing. Therefore Sri Lankan rowers are fast reaching international standards. There are four types of rowing boats in Sri Lanka: Sculls (one oarsman), Pair and Double Sculls (two oarsmen each) and Fours (four oarsmen and one cox).
Judging your prowess in the sport mainly depends on timing. You do not necessarily have to be in the water to calculate your timing. We have an indoor machine from which we can time ourselves by our pace. You need to know what you are good at too. For example there are those who do well on the Four but cannot handle the Scull. I handle the Scull, Double and Four. I represent the Senior category, Hashen explained.
He notes that a sportsman needs to have a lot of dedication to excel as a rower.
It is a very time consuming sport. Rowing one kilometer takes at least four mates and you need to row at least 20 kilometers per day. We have our practice sessions at Beira Lake and Diyawanna Lake.
We row from 1.30 pm till 7 pm. Rowing training is done three days, gym training is on two days, fitness is for one day and we also have a morning run on one day, he expressed. Oarsmen have to row for two kilometers in international competitions but local competitions excluding the nationals is one kilometer. Hashens first rowing competition was a two kilometer under 16 race at Bolgoda Lake in 2011. His first international competition was the Asian Junior Rowing Championships in Thaiwan.
An oarsman does not necessarily have to be a good swimmer to engage in rowing. Even if the boat topples it floats and the oarsman can hang on to it till he or she is rescued.
Hashen won the Maalyn Dias Scholarship for the most outstanding emerging Sportsman of the year in 2014. He became the Colombo Rowing Club Oarsman of the Year in 2016. He became a Presidents Scout this year. Hashen is also a member of the Royal College Literary Club. He was nominated for the Monash University Future Leader Award in 2016 by his school. He is in grade 13.
Queried on how he manages his studies with his rigorous rowing sessions Hashen says that it is all about a matter of planning a schedule. He will be engaging in training and then rushing back home to take up studies. Time management was the most challenging aspect of it all.
Recalling his most memorable moment in connection with the sport Hashen says that the Roy-Tho Regatta 2014 tops the list.
We won our race by inches! The event was the A Double Scull and it was held in Beira Lake, he mused.
The rowing calendar is from January to October. November and December is their off season. April to October is their peak season and oarsmen need to watch what they drink during this period.
Our schedule is hectic and it is tough on our families as well at first but everyone gradually gets use to it with time, he pointed out.
Hashens father and mother are both into banking. His father is Halin Hettigoda. His mother is Manoji Hettigoda. His sister too started rowing three years ago.
Hashens ambition is to become an engineer. He has chosen commerce for his G C E Advanced Level examination. He is also sitting for his London A Level in the maths stream.
I look up to my Chirath Karunanayake who was the Captain of the Royal College Rowing crew in 2011. My international sports hero is the New Zealand rower Mah Owens Drysdale. He is the current Olympic champion and five-time World champion in the single Sculls, Hashen said.
He says that a combination of what he witness in day to day life inspires him. He notes that many believe that one needs to take supplements to be fit and excel in the sport.
This is a misconception. You need to be dedicated and motivated towards the sport. Even if it is a painful process, just keep rowing. Try your best and plan your schedule. As long as you are spot on, you will be able to manage anything, he advised.

Sri Lanka to abolish import control fee for tea
Sri Lankas cabinet nod has been received to abolish the import control license fee for imported tea in line with 2017 budget proposals.
There has been a significant debate on the issue of importing cheaper leaves for blending and re-export, over fears of damaging Ceylon Tea brand.
Some tea exporters however want to import leaves from countries like Kenya, Vietnam and Indonesia, and blend them with higher quality local produce for higher returns. The country earlier charged 1 percent fee on CIF value of flavored and non-flavored imported tea as a control license fee.
Instead of that the government has now proposed a license fee of 1,000 rupees to be charged for each and every license which will be issued to import tea for re-export purposes.
This joint proposal has been submitted by Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama.
Accordingly, the gazette notification No. 1953/28 is to be amended taking into affect the new revision.

Sri Lanka highlights importance of political commitment to sustainable tourism
The importance of political commitment for the development and implementation of sustainable tourism goals was highlighted during an international tourism conference currently taking place in Manilla, Philippines.
Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga who is representing Sri Lanka at the 6th International Conference on Tourism Statistics: Measuring Sustainable Tourism observed that while sustainable tourism was important, the tools to measure sustainability were equally important. The conference is being jointly organized by the Department of Tourism, Philippines and the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).
The conference kicked-off in Manila yesterday with a Ministerial Roundtable where tourism leaders from UNWTO, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Seychelles, South Africa, Fiji, Zimbabwe, Indonesia, South Korea, China, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Costa Rica, Peru, Kenya, Switzerland, Mexico, Spain, France, Egypt, Canada, Belarus, Belgium, and Germany are participating.
The roundtable will focus on the need for more integrated, credible data to manage and promote a more sustainable tourism sector. A Declaration will be adopted on the need for Tourism Ministers, Statistical Chiefs, and Environmental Officials to work together in developing and implementing statistical tools to assess and measure tourisms contribution in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The UNWTO International Conference on Tourism Statistics, which is organized every 5 to 10 years, serves as a forum to advance and to set an agenda for better understanding of the statistical and planning side of tourism based on international standards. This 6th edition is also an official event to celebrate the 2017 International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development.

Sri Lanka shines at World Tea Expo
Ceylon tea shone at this years World Tea Expo, drawing attention to the official country of origin and showing by example its pedigree of social, economic, and environmental responsibility.
Sri Lanka is the largest exporter of black orthodox tea, accounting for 6.2% of world production and exporting 16.9% of the worlds tea.
Sri Lanka employs 1.5 million people in the cultivation and processing of hand-plucked leaf.
Premala Srikantha, Director (Promotion) for the Sri Lanka Tea Board under the Ministry of Plantation Industries, received a plaque commemorating 150 years of Ceylon tea from Manik Jayakumar, founder of QTrade Teas & Herbs, in Cerritos, California.
Jayakumar is a native of Sri Lanka and former manager of several prestigious Sri Lankan tea gardens.
Rohan Pethiyagoda, who chairs the Sri Lanka Tea Board, said the occasion presented not only an opportunity to share Ceylon tea with the USA 'but the whole of the tea-drinking world'. The Tea Board announced a Global Ceylon Tea Party to be celebrated July 6 at 5 pm at Sri Lankan diplomatic missions worldwide.
The event begins in Fiji, then advances by the hour to New Zealand and continues in every time zone.
On the exhibition floor, Chamara Udugama at Tea Talk said the Sri Lanka pavilion provided good exposure to the 3,500 attending.

Jayakumar, the events Platinum Sponsor, described Sri Lankas commitment to sustainability during a presentation at the special events stage. Teas from Sri Lanka are the only teas in the world to earn 'ozone-friendly' status under the Montreal Protocol, one of the most successful and effective environmental treaties ever implemented. Many of the gardens there are organic and all greatly limit the use of pesticides, he explained.
Srikantha said that Sri Lanka has developed the capability to process tea quickly and to add value in packaging and advanced shipping. The tea auction at Colombo consistently ranks first in pricing teas.

Sri Lankan who killed Rajive Ghandi appeals for mercy killing

The Sri Lankan convict, Robert Payas serving jail time for assassinating former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has appealed the Tamil Nadu government for a mercy killing.
According to the Sri Lankan national, none of his family members have paid him a visit in years and since the government is not very keen in carrying out an execution or releasing him, its time that he should be allowed to give his life.
In a letter to state government, Payas wrote, Despite the Tamil Nadu government supporting me, no efforts are being taken. Both the Central governments (UPA and NDA) have remained silent on this issue and (it) seems to me like both want my life to end in prison.
In 1991, Robert Payas was among the 26 sentenced to death for conspiring to assassinate late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi but 19 of them were released later.

Tips to build sustainable homes
RECYCLED MATERIALS FOR SUSTAINABLE HOUSE CONSTRUCTION
Recycling is very important. This will have to be balanced with availability. Depending where you are the materials that are easily available will vary. There are all sorts of materials that are recycled, reclaimed, and reused. Here is a list of some materials that you may choose to by recycled.
Countertops made from Recycled Glass
Steel made from recycled metals.
Reclaimed Wood. These can be beautiful. When a contractor demolishes a building or does a renovation they often can reuse old wood products they salvage. There are lumber yards that specialize in purchasing and selling reclaimed wood.
Reclaimed Bricks and other masonry. bricks, stones, and pavers can also be reclaimed and reused.
Reuse soils from the excavation for new landscaping.
Roof shingles can have recycled content.
Plastic Products with recycled content.
Drywall materials that were recycled.
Just about any product in your new home could come from recycled materials.
You will also want to reduce job site waste and make sure the contractor recycles all the job site waste materials during construction.
INSULATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUSTAINABLE HOMES
Insulation is a big one. Check out another article we wrote on spray insulation for new homes. First things first, vocabulary. R value is a term we use to rate the insulation value of a material. R value = Resistance the higher the R value the more insulation. You want to make sure that your home has a sufficient R value for your climate. There are lots of different insulation types and techniques. Discuss your options with your design and construction team.
The most important thing is to insulate your home to keep the hot air out during the summer and keep the warm air in during the winter. Insulation is really important. If your area has energy codes make sure to meet at least the minimum standards for insulation. At our firm we typically surpass the code insulation standards when building a green or sustainable home. Good insulation is one of the most important energy efficient house ideas. Heating and air conditioning is the largest percentages of energy use and your energy bill. The better insulation you have the less energy you will use.
AIR SEALING
Air sealing goes with insulation. This is one of the lesser know energy efficient home design ideas and one that people often forget about. Air sealing prevents air from leaking through your house. You want to make sure your house isnt leaking conditioned air. What is the point of having all that insulation if there is cold air blowing through cracks and crevasses in your walls. There needs to be sealing at all the openings and penetrations through your roofs and walls. This includes windows, doors, vents, electrical conduit, and any other holes and penetrations. These all need sufficient sealing through caulking or other methods. We often recommend closed cell spray foam insulation. It not only insulates but expands and seals up openings, small holes, and cracks in the construction.
WINDOW AND DOOR SELECTION FOR ENERGY REDUCTION
You have to use efficient windows and doors. They need to have proper weather stripping to keep out the elements. They need to close tight so as to seal the opening. The types of glass and material insulation value also are very important. Windows and doors are expensive but you want to make sure they are not going to cost you more in the long run when using inefficient products. Windows and doors are also a weak point for air leakage. Make sure you have proper air sealing around these areas. You dont want to buy good windows and install the with poor quality.
SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS
We want to use materials that avoid Volatile Organic Compounds or VOCs. Examples can be using low VOC paint or glues in the construction of your new home.
Use materials that can be recycled later and have all ready been recycled. Using local materials is a good start to sustainability. There are lots of sustainable materials in nature for example woods that are renewable and certified. Also use durable materials. If you have to replace something in a few years that is not sustainable.
ENERGY STAR APPLIANCES & EQUIPMENT
Use all energy efficient appliances and equipment. As a minimum requirement use energy star rated appliances. As I write this article I am using an energy star rated computer monitor. Did you know you can get an energy star TV Your kitchen appliances can use a good amount of energy so look for those energy star labels. Also your heating, ac units, and water heaters should all be energy star rated.
WATER CONSERVING PLUMBING FIXTURES
Toilets and other plumbing fixtures are not the same as they used to be. They make dual flush toilets where you can choose a lower flush rate or the higher rate as needed. All your plumbing fixtures can have reduced or Low-flow water usage including faucets and shower heads. These fixtures are becoming very popular. You will have no trouble finding plumbing fixtures that use water at lower flow rates. There is no need to be wasteful.
BUILD TO LAST
Build To Last! I can not emphasize this enough. If you want to build a sustainable house you need to Build To Last. If your house constantly needs repairs that is not sustainable. If your roof needs to be redone every 6 years that is not sustainable. Build your home to last. The craftsmanship should be such that it will survive time and hardship. Build with materials that require little maintenance. Build with intelligence. If you are in an area prone to hurricanes and you build a deck with recycled wood it is not sustainable if the deck gets torn down in the hurricane. I am not saying dont build that deck but build it with proper hurricane ties and strapping and use wood that can handle the elements. Build a home suitable to your climate and environmental needs. Build it well. Take care of your home when you are living in it and build your house so it takes care of you. Build To Last. Sustainable house design cannot be achieved without thinking of construction quality and techniques for a long lasting home.

Govt. should provide allowance to flood-stricken tea smallholders
Since tea cultivation in the south were devastated by recent floods, the government should provide allowance to tea smallholders until they start replanting and earn an income, said Tea Small Holders National Congress Organiser Lal Premanath.
He said so addressing a meeting held at Morawaka on June 19. Premanath said nearly 9,800 tea smallholdings were destroyed and the estimated damage is more than Rs. 600 million. This would be an adverse impact on the economy which will be seriously felt in another few months rather than immediately. It would take atleast three years for smallholders to reap the crop and earn an income from their replanted plots.
Premanath said, the government needs not incur an additional expenditure to assist affected tea smallholders because it could rely on the Cess fund which had reached over USD 60 million, rather than retaining it in the consolidated fund.

Lanka has potential to be world-class fintech centre
The increase in the use of technology in the financial industry (fintech) is changing the face of entire banking and financial sector and Sri Lanka has the potential to become a world class centre for Fintech businesses owing to its higher literacy rate, penetration of banking accounts and the distinctive mobile network, Chief FinTech Officer of Monitory Authority of Singapore Sopnedu Mohanty said.
He made these observations delivering the keynote speech at Lankapay Technnovation Awards 2017 held in Colombo.
To accelerate digital innovation in the financial sector, Mohanty insisted that the regulators need to conduct experiments rather than following old- fashioned white papers or desk policies on technology.
If you write a white paper on technology, by the time the white paper becomes a policy, the technology has changed. The only way to catch up with technology is to do experiments
Smartness of a true financial sector comes when you partner with neighbours and start building a network of smart centres, he said.
Noting the regulators inability to understand disruptive technologies in a proper way, Mohanty urged that policy makers need to think and act carefully when it comes to building a truly outstanding digitally enabled financial sector.
Chief Guest at the event, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy highlighted that Sri Lanka needs to have a export driven public private partnership model to garner economic benefits and to avert declining exports as a percentage of GDP. The governor also noted that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is in the process of adjusting fiscal and monetary policy to stabilize the inflation from 4% to 3-2% range.
Bank of Ceylon bagged the pinnacle of all awards by winning the Gold as the Overall Winner for Excellence in Interbank Payments while Seylan Bank claimed the Silver Award as the Overall Runner Up. The Overall Merit Award was secured by Union Bank of Colombo PLC.

Use Colombos garbage as landfill for Financial City Project
Finding a site to dump garbage is not an issue as there is a ready-made venue for the port city project in Galle Face said former President of Chamber of Commerce, Tissa jayaweera. He said that the port city project uses sand and rook to reclaim sea investing a lot of money and machinery. Instead the port city project can use the sorted out garbage collected from Colombo and use in the filling of the land.
He said that though many consider garbage as an issue, both the private sector and government have not made use of garbage to generate revenue. Garbage is a valuable recourse for land fill. A quick and cheap solution would be to use this garbage as land fill for the Financial City Project that is taking place as port city. By this method we will be able to save on sand which is currently being used,he said.
A simple Rotary Separator can be designed depending on mesh size of grit required. Unwanted material can be collected at end of the Rotary Separator and taken away for separation as glass, metal, polythene, etc.
The Grit can be mixed with sand and used as land fill at the port city as well as other projects that require land fill. The Grit will be perfect top soil which will be mostly decomposed vegetation or bio fertilizer.
Many countries of the world are now turning garbage to energy, compost being the outdated method. We have done none and many projects have been formulated, but none have been implemented.
Garbage in the country have detonated to such as extent that the garbage has been converted to solid waste ideal for land fill other than a limited amount of polythene, plastic, styrofoam, glass, and metal (SS)

Attacks on places of worship hamper good governance
The Methodist Church of Sri Lanka condemned the attempt to obstruct the legal carrier of Lakshan Dias who stood up for rights of Methodists in Sri Lanka, yesterday.
The Church, in a statement issue under President/Bishop Rev. Asiri P Perera, says that the church observes such obstruction aiming at neutralizing a world-acclaimed HR activist will bring discredit to the country.
The Methodist Church has been serving Sri Lanka since 1814, and during this period, the church, in addition to its Christian religious services, established more than 200 schools and conducted them until they were vested in the State in 1962. Today, the Methodist Church Sri Lanka has more than 300 churches which are worshiping communities islandwide.
During its entire history, the Methodist Church has respected the traditions and religious convictions of the Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic and other religions and has had cordial and good, working relationships with their leaders and organizations. In common issues faced by the people, the Methodist Church has stood up with other religious leaders to bring relief to people.
We have also been able to spread the light of education, overcoming religious barriers, through our schools. For an example, the highly-respected Principals of the famous Buddhist schools Ananda College and Nalanda College P. de S. Kularatna and L. H. Methananda, were products of the schools that were conducted by the Methodist Church.
However, we are sorry to note that a wave of extreme ethnic and religious fanaticism has spread throughout our country for the last 10 years. We hoped that with the dawn of the 'Good Governance Government' in 2015, this wave would have abated and we state that due to the humane and righteous vision and policies of the President and the government, this wave of fanaticism was subdued to a larger extent. But unfortunately, since of late, we have observed this fearful trend raising its head once again. What should be done is that all religions come together to establish and affirm noble human qualities in this country.
There have been incidents where the freedom to worship of our members were obstructed by these extremist religious groups. This has happened in Deniyaya, Habarana, Piliyandala, Kekirawa and Hiniduma areas. On several occasions, mobs led by a few saffron-robed individuals had physically obstructed our members from worshiping. These same groups have obstructed construction of churches in Hiniduma and Buttala which were being done on our own land after obtaining necessary permission from the authorities. We have been conducting worship services in Hiniduma and Buttala areas for about 20 years.
One of the few lawyers who stood up for our cause and acted to protect our rights was Lakshan Dias. We are sorry to note and strongly condemn the attempt to obstruct his legal carrier by some individuals who have been misled by these extremist.
We also observe that such obstruction aiming at neutralizing a world acclaimed Human Rights activist will bring discredit to our country.
We hope and pray that an environment where people of all faiths could practice their religions freely without a hindrance would be dawned in the country as it has been in the past.

Battle for Mosul: Destruction of al-Nuri mosque 'shows IS defeated'

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi says the destruction of an ancient mosque in the city of Mosul is "an official declaration of defeat" by so-called Islamic State (IS).
Iraqi forces say IS blew up the Great Mosque of al-Nuri and its famous leaning minaret as jihadists battled to stop advancing pro-government troops.
IS said American aircraft had destroyed the complex, a claim denied by the US.
The mosque, which was more than 800 years old, was where IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed a "caliphate" in 2014.
Its destruction has brought widespread condemnation.
A senior US commander in Iraq said IS had destroyed "one of Mosul and Iraq's great treasures".
"This is a crime against the people of Mosul and all of Iraq, and is an example of why this brutal organisation must be annihilated," Maj Gen Joseph Martin said.
The Iraqi commander in charge of the offensive to retake Mosul said troops were within 50m (160ft) of the mosque when IS "committed another historical crime".
Thousands of Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, supported by US-led coalition warplanes and military advisers, are involved in the battle to retake the key city, which waslaunched on 17 October last year.
The government announced the full "liberation" of eastern Mosul in January but the west of the city has presented a more difficult challenge, with its narrow, winding streets.
The al-Nuri mosque dated back to 1172 and was named after a noble who fought against the early crusaders.
The leaning minaret was nicknamed "the hunchback".
A month after IS forces overran Mosul in June 2014, Baghdadi gave a Friday sermon from the pulpit inside the mosque and proclaimed a caliphate - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law, or Sharia, by God's deputy on Earth, or caliph.
It was his first public appearance in many years.
On Sunday, commanders announced the start of the "final chapter" of the offensive, with Iraq's counter-terrorism service, army and federal police attacking the Old City from all directions.
The army said it believed there were no more than 300 militants left in Mosul, compared with almost 6,000 at the start of the offensive in October.
Earlier this week aircraft dropped leaflets urging civilians to avoid open spaces and to take any opportunity to escape.
The UN has warned that IS may be holding more than 100,000 people in Mosul as human shields.

Ceylinco Life launches Degree Saver for childrens higher education
A new life policy that helps parents save for the higher education of their children has been launched by Ceylinco Life, in recognition of the ever-escalating costs of overseas university education.
Combining the features of a life insurance policy and a savings scheme, the life insurance leaders Degree Saver is structured to create an education fund based on an agreed premium and policy term, while offering life cover for the duration.
The Education Fund will accumulate for the term of the policy with interest calculated at an accumulation rate which will be declared by the company on a monthly basis, ensuring that a fund adequate to meet the familys higher education costs will be available when the policy matures.
The protection component of the Degree Saver policy provides life insurance cover to the parents,offering them peace of mind with the knowledge that their childs or childrens higher education will continue even if they lose their lives before the policy matures.
This is an easy to understand policy that addresses one of the biggest concerns of parents today, Ceylinco Life Director and Deputy CEO Thushara Ranasinghe said. An increasing number of students aspire to degrees from foreign universities each year, and in many instances parents cannot afford the cost, and often raise loans to pay for their childrens higher education.
Because we offer policy terms of up to 30 years, they can start saving as early as they like with a Ceylinco Life Degree Saver policy, and also enjoy the protection of life insurance.
The premiums for both the education fund and the life cover are paid as one, and policyholders can choose the frequency atwhich to pay their premiums -- monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually. Policyholders may choose any policy term between 10 and 30 years.
They may also purchase additional benefits such as cover for critical illness, major surgery, hospitalisation and accidental death or disability, expanding the scope of the protection offered by the Degree Saver policy.
A Ceylinco Life Degree Saver policy may be purchased from any Ceylinco Life branch country-wide, and also makes policyholders eligible for the numerous benefits offered by the company as policyholder rewards, including the Ceylinco Life Family Savari programme and the Pranama scholarships for their children.
The market leader in Sri Lankas life insurance sector since 2004, Ceylinco Life has close to a million lives covered by active policies.
The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.

RIGHT CONDUCT FOR BUDDHIST MONKS
A Buddhist monk is expected to observe a certain code of conduct in order to overcome his desire for the objects of the world and end his suffering.
To continue the three-fold practice of sila (morality), prajna (wisdom), and samadi (tranquility) on the Eightfold Path and overcome all types of craving, he has to exercise a great restraint on his thoughts, desires and behaviour.
According to the tenets of early Buddhism, every monk who declared allegiance to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sanga was expected to follow the Eightfold Path and observe a certain code of conduct as specified in the teachings of the Buddha.
The early Buddhist monks were mostly wanderers and mendicants, who were inspired by the teachings and the personality of the Buddha himself. They travelled from village to village and rested only during the rainy season in special dwelling places known as aramas and viharas.
But today we can see Buddhist monks taking part in various violent demonstrations. Some Buddhist monks are involved in politics. Some are involved in various business activities. Some are addressing political meetings. Some are trade union leaders. Some are having millions and millions in their bank accounts. Some are having several luxury vehicles.
We very kindly request these monks not to involve in these wrong behaviour and conduct. The whole world is watching. They are doing a very serious damage to Buddhism.
We very kindly request the Buddhist monks to follow the path recommended by Lord Buddha.
The world is respecting the Buddhist monks because of their simple, calm, quiet, peaceful, kind and compassionate behaviour.

Committee appointed to oversee physical fitness, condition of Sri Lankan cricket team

The Sri Lanka Cricket Board said that a high-profile evaluation and monitoring committee was appointed yesterday to oversee the physical fitness and condition of the players.
The committee headed by Asanka Gurusinha will carry out the evaluation and monitoring process ahead of the upcoming campaigns against Zimbabwe and India in Colombo.
The move comes in the wake of Sri Lankas unfortunate exit in the quarter final stage of the Champions Trophy 2017, where they lost to Pakistan on June 12.
Elaborating on the plans set in motion, Team manager Asanka Gurusinha said, We know how much resource and effort was invested in the team ahead of the CT17, and we know how much effort each and every player made both on and off the field  but we have to face the reality that we were just not good enough on that day, and studied the reasons behind this.
We had several internal discussions with the coaches, trainers, the selectors, and the players themselves, and we all agreed that there is a disparity in our fitness levels. We have incredibly talented cricketers, with the passion and the commitment to fly the flag on high  but they are not quite cricketing athletes, which is what we need to be.
The National Selectors met on June 16 and selected a provisional squad of 30 players.
These 30 players will undergo rigorous testing & evaluation this week, and will only make it into the squads for the Zimbabwe and India tours provided they meet the required grading
The initial testing of the 30 member provisional squad was conducted this morning under the supervision of SLC HP Training and Rehabilitation Manager Nirmalan Thanabalasingham who commented 
Sri Lanka Cricket High Performance Sports Medicine and Sports Science Department are running a battery of fitness tests encompassing body composition, speed, power and endurance.
We will provide this information to the selectors to help guide their decision making but more importantly give players a plan to improve areas of concern in a realistic time frame.
The committee, National Selection Committee Chairman Sanath Jayasuriya, Team Manager Asanka Gurusinha, SLC Medical Panel Chairman Professor Arjuna de Silva, High Performance Manager Simon Willis, Rehabilitation Manager Nirmalan Thanabalasingham and National Trainer Nicholas Lee has formulated a strict evaluation criteria.

Court orders Mervin Silva to pay Rs. 400, 000 compensation

The Supreme Court today ordered former Deputy Minister Mervin Silva to pay compensation of Rs.400, 000 as damages to a resident of Kiribathgoda by June 27 this year.
President's Counsel Anil de Silva appearing on behalf of the former Minister gave an undertaking to the Supreme Court three-judge-bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep that the compensation would be paid before June 27.
On November 28, last year, the Supreme Court ordered former Deputy Minister Mervin Silva to pay compensation of Rs.400, 000 personally as damages to a resident of Kiribathgoda and ruled that former Deputy Minister and former OIC of the Kiribathgoda Police infringed the fundamental rights of the petitioner after demolishing a part of his residential house in 2010.
The Supreme Court further ordered the former OIC of Kiribathgoda police to pay compensation of Rs.50, 000 to the petitioner for demolition of the parapet wall of Petitioner with the blessing of former Kiribathgoda OIC.
In his Fundamental Rights petition, petitioner Asitha Nanayakkara Liyanage, a resident of Kiribathgoda had cited former Chairman of Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha Prasanna Ranaweera, Secretary to the Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha Hemapala Hettiarachchi, Commissioner of Local Government Kachcheri Complex, Gampaha, Chief Inspector of Police Kiribathgoda Police Station, former Deputy Minister Mervyn Silva and three others as respondents.
The Supreme Court had declared that the former Minister and former OIC have infringed the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed in terms and Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Both the above Respondents have wittingly breached the fundamental rights of the Petitioner.
At all times relevant to this application a Minister of the State was involved and thus makes the State also liable. As such court directs the State to pay a sum of Rs. 100, 000-as compensation to the Petitioner, the Supreme Court ruled. The Supreme Court further directed the Inspector General of Police to conduct investigations according to law and ascertain whether any other person is responsible for the destruction of Petitioners property and in doing so whether instruments and machinery belonging to the State had been used and utilised, and take suitable action having consulted the Attorney General.
The Petitioner, a resident of Iriyawetiya Junction, Kandy Road, Kiribathgoda, complains against all Respondents in his Fundamental Rights Application to the Supreme Court filed on 01.10.2010, of certain harassments and abuses caused to him and his family, which ultimately resulted in demolition and destruction caused to part of his residential house. It is averred inter alia in the petition filed in the court that on 18.09.2010.
Seven Respondents had come with equipment and vehicles belonging to the Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha and destroyed the parapet wall bordering the Petitioners property bordering the KandyIriyawetiya Road and also destroyed two toilets and a washroom within the premises owned by him.
The petitioner alleged that the demolition of the petitioners parapet wall was done with vehicle and instruments of the Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha with the blessing of the 1st and 2nd Respondents and 4th Respondent former Kiribathgoda OIC deployed Police personnel to provide security on the instructions of 7th Respondent Mervyn Silva.

Cricketers body fat must go down - Dayasiri
All cricketers will subject to a fitness test before they qualify to play in the national team, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said yesterday.
The Minister addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing stressed that no exception would be made to the rule in future, Whether they are popular or not, all will have to be fit to play, he said.
He further explained that fitness was not a qualification to play thus far and that has been to the detriment of the team, We need players to play 10 overs in a 50 over match, not just four, the minister said as he pointed out that certain players had up to 20 percent of body fat though the recommended level was 12.
I am not saying the Sri Lanka cricket team has no talent, they are very talented but when we play with international teams, we notice the difference in fitness between our players and theirs. This a common problem in Sri Lankan cricket, he said.
Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara further noted fitness should be built from a younger age and it needed to be mandatory for players playing in Under 13, Under 17 and Under 15 teams,
We dont have fitness tests at these levels but other countries subject their younger players to fitness tests to build their endurance, so when they are older, they are fit, he noted.
The Sports Minister observed that when fitness was not part of the regiment from a younger age, the older the player gets, the more prone to injury he becomes.
The lack of fitness in the team, he said was also a concern voiced by the coaches of the team.

Deadly threat
Tiny bite:
Dengue outbreak reaching epic proportions:
The 1,080 bed Sri Jayawardenapura General hospital has been at 80-90 percent occupancy since April. Most of them are dengue patients. The dengue outbreak this year is predicted to be worse than that of last year; which set a record for the highest number of dengue patients in a year.
We had to stop admitting patients for a few hours on Sunday as we had run out of beds, but we opened OPD admissions on Monday when around 100 patients were discharged, said the General Hospital Director, Dr. Susitha Senaratne.
The normal occupancy rate of the hospital is around 70-75 percent and nurses and minor staff are allocated to accommodate such numbers, but with occupancy rates increasing significantly, especially over the last two weeks, Dr. Senaratne said his staff had to work continuously to meet the demands of patient care. The Director said that there was a deficit of 20 percent when it came to nursing staff and most were working 24 hours a day to meet the shortfall. With such demands on the nursing staff, mistakes are bound to happen, he said.
In February, we understood that there would be a dengue epidemic soon. So in March, we allocated an extra 500 beds for dengue patients. That too has not been sufficient now, he said.
The hospital has been admitting 400-450 patients suspected of dengue each day. When they had to temporarily close down OPD admissions on Sunday, the patient count had gone up to 900.
Thus far, the total number of deaths reported from the Jayawardenapura hospital stands at 12.
Jayawardenepura however, is not the worst hit hospital. The Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) in Angoda has been the central place for dengue patients in the Western Province which has 27,272 cases; the highest number in the country recorded thus far.
IDH too shut down its admissions earlier this week as it was unable to cope with increasing patient numbers. They have at present however, re-opened admissions.
We can accommodate 200 patients here, but we had that number increased to 500-600 patients coming in. My responsibility is to ensure all have proper sanitary facilities and we could not do that with so many patients. So we had to temporarily close admissions, said IDH, Director, Dr. Dimuthu Ratnayake.
The President and Minister of Health visited the hospital this week and they promised that they would arrange dengue units in the surrounding hospitals such as Thalangama. They also promised to release doctors from other hospitals to come here to help us deal with the increasing numbers, she said.
The hospital had received a new batch of nurses and minor staff last month, but it still had to deal with the problem of lack of space and infrastructure. We also need to take into account the patients' diets, cleanliness, linen and toilets.
At present I have 2-3 patients on each bed. We have also added extra beds on to the corridors. We are so crowded, the doctors are finding it hard to manoeuvre their way around during their usual ward rounds, said Dr. Ratnayake.
The majority of dengue patients seem to come here. Dengue is not a special infectious disease any more, so they can go to other hospitals, added the director.
She further explained that they had informed the Health Ministry earlier on, about a possible outbreak, but no action was taken until the last minute.
It is very easy to set up dengue units in other hospitals. All you need to have is a simple redistribution of instruments and beds, she said. Dr. Ratnayake added that she expected the current epidemic to continue for the next couple of months.
It is not only government hospitals but also private hospitals which have been inundated with dengue patients. The Daily News on Tuesday (20) reported that several private hospitals in Colombo such as Durdans, Asiri Medical, and Nawaloka were struggling to admit dengue patients.
According to Dr. Senaratne however, 30 percent of patients currently admitted at his hospital do not need to be there. Do not rush to admit. People need to follow doctors advice when it comes to admission and not push for it. A large percentage can be treated at home. Admissions are only needed when cases are critical, he said.
Numbers unusually high
This is the usual dengue peak period but the numbers are higher than expected this year, explained Dr. Ratnayake, as she explained that this year, the Type 2 strain of dengue which is more fatal had become increasingly prevalent.
We have had 300 patients diagnosed with dengue, out of that 100 are critical (leaking patients). Those that are critical need high dependency care as they are likely to get dengue haemorrhagic fever, said Dr. Ratnayake.
Last year, Type 1 was more prevalent and while numbers were large, the number of critical cases were less. But, this year with Type 2 raising its head, Dr. Ratnayake warned that patients can go into shock even on day one of the fever.
It is better if people get tested for dengue on the first day itself, she said.
Dr. Senaratne who also reiterated the IDH Director when it came to dengue numbers, also observed that this year, cases had started to appear early on.
We had dengue cases being reported from March itself this year. It is unusual for dengue to appear during the dry season, as it usually peaks during the monsoons, he said.
The Jayawardenapura Director noted that they had discovered various evolutionary changes in the female mosquito of the species Aedesaegypti which had lead it appearing earlier on and it was also laying more eggs.
Our methods of controlling breeding has to be updated in this instance. The mosquito is adapting faster than our control measures, he said.
Dr. Senaratne also pointed out that areas such as Battaramulla and Thalawathugoda were not known for dengue earlier, but were now reporting an increasing number of cases.
He added that the recent floods and the prolonged issue of waste management around the country could have further worsened the dengue situation.
Type 2
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are four distinct but closely related serotypes of the virus that cause dengue - DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4.
Recovery from infection by one provides lifelong immunity against that particular serotype. However, cross-immunity to the other serotypes after recovery is only partial and temporary. Subsequent infections by other serotypes increase the risk of developing severe dengue, explained the WHO.
According to WHO data, In 2017 (as of Epidemiological Week 11), the Western Pacific Region has reported dengue outbreaks in several Member States in the Pacific, as well as the circulation of DENV-1 and DENV-2 serotypes.
According to IDH Senior Consultant Physician and dengue expert, Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama, there are generally one or two strains prevalent in any given area and after a couple of years, new types replace the old in prevalence. We dont know why this happens but it has been the case around the world, he said.
He noted that the number of dengue cases had been increasing over the past several months but had gone unnoticed among the general public as well as the authorities.
We had our biggest outbreak in 2016 with 55,000 cases being reported. In the first six months of this year alone, we have recorded 65,000 cases. And we still have six months more to go, said Dr. Wijewickrama.
Commenting on the increase, he said that the erratic rains during the dry season this year followed by the floods, had simply allowed the virus to start spreading early.
The cases started earlier on, so by the time the monsoons came, we had already built up quite a number of cases.
That is why we have more numbers this year, said the dengue expert.
The changes this year thus, shows that in addition to preventing mosquito breeding, authorities would also need to seriously factor in climate change as one of the drivers of dengue.
A study published by Hales et al in The Lancet in 2002, estimated that with climate change and population growth factored in, 50-60 percent of the Earths population would be at risk of dengue by 2085. Without climate change, they estimated that the number could fall to 35 percent.
In Sri Lanka, we are at double the risk as even the basic dengue preventive measures have not been able to sustain themselves over time.
We have issues with waste disposal, our preventive programmes both at the individual and institutional level are not effective. The community is not helping and the media is not interested, said Dr. Wijewickrama.
He explained that the number of deaths could be reduced through early detection but as numbers increase, the chances of patients going undetected would simply rise. We will not have the resources to monitor all closely, he added.
As Sri Lanka was a country which successfully eradicated Malaria, Dr. Wijewickrama believed that we could do the same with dengue, but this would need more concerted and continuous effort from all sides, if it were to be a success.
Malaria took a long time to eradicate but we can do the same here. However, we need more effort, he said.
Despite several attempts made to contact National Dengue Control Unit, Director Dr. Hasitha Tissera, he was not available for comment.
Research
Given the increasing prevalence of Type 2, Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital is at present conducting research to identify the characteristic of patients who are prone to bleeding (Type 2). We are analysing every patient we get and recording their details. This will allow us to identify if there are any patterns related to their disease and other characteristics such as age, weight, etc, said Dr. Senaratne.
He expected their research to be concluded in the next few months.
If we can identify these high risk people, we can immediately take action to control the virus, he added.
Generally pregnant women, persons with diabetes, children and the old are known to be at high risk for dengue. In addition, those who have been infected with dengue once also have a higher chance of being infected again.
Secondary people are at high risk. It is like a viral flue, they can get it again and again, said Dr. Senaratne.
Ideally, if we treat a patient early and identify it early, no one should be dying of dengue, said Dr. Senaratne.

Defence pact with U.S. to be extended
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament the Government intends to extend the Defence Pact signed with the US in 2007 for a further period of time.
The Prime Minister responding to a question by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said several rounds of preliminary discussions were held in this regard with the US counterparts.He said it was also discussed with tri-force and Defence Ministry officials. However the Premier said the renewed agreement unlike the previous does not indicate a specific time period, but the provision has been made to terminate it unilaterally after giving notice prior to 180 days.
The Premier said as per the agreement the two countries agree for mutual assistance in providing various services and facilities. These types of agreements are important considering the current political developments in the world, he said.
Wickremesinghe, however, said the US counterparts have requested more time to proceed with the agreement.
He said the defence pact would be presented to Parliament after endorsement. MP Dissanayake requested a Parliament debate on the agreement before signing it and the Premier agreed to do so also stressing that the Government has not deviated from the non-aligned foreign policy.

Dengue, garbage to be taken head on
Full strength to be utilised to tackle menace:
Not holding of Local Govt polls is not the cause:
Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday warned that dengue numbers could worsen in future and that proper waste management could help control the situation.
Cabinet this week approved a proposal put forward by the Prime Minister on a program to have disposal of waste to recognsed lands under environmental laws, take judicial action to prevent public protests on waste disposal, waste to be disposed only by grading, provide necessary tools for local government authorities and increase awareness of the public with regard to waste.
Addressing the weekly cabinet briefing yesterday the minister stressed that the government was working on controlling the garbage issue and denied reports that local government was not performing its basic duties since they were dissolved two years ago.
In 2009, we had one of the worst outbreaks where number of deaths was 1000:1 but in 2015 we had the lowest numbers and there were no local government members.
When we had local government members, they did not pay much attention to this. It is true that if there are one or two good members, it would be easier as there are only officials now but statistically you cannot say local government members control the situation better, Minister Senaratne said.
Dengue will get worse as flood waters recede further. This happened last year too, he said.
The minister also stressed that climatic conditions too attributed to the break and the government alone could not be blamed, Between June and July monsoons there is a peak, again it will come in October and November, he said.
He further explained that the Ministry had conducted various dengue detection programmes, purchased 500 fogging machines and hired 500 personnel for the eradication programme in the Western Province alone with another 1000 expected to be hired to cover the rest of the country.
Our healthcare system works and it is due to that, that we were able to decrease number of death in 2009 from 1000:1 to 1000:0.3 at present. With proper waste management we should be able to control it, he said.
The Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) has done research on a new variety of herbivorous mosquito which does not attack humans, Their larvae are seen to eat dengue mosquito larvae, Minister Senaratne said.
He has also spoken to his Australian counterpart over a bacteria developed in Australia which can kill dengue mosquitoes.He said they will help establish contact between local and Australian researchers by the end of this month at least.
As the Minister faces a losing battle with dengue, he stressed that awareness alone could not solve the issue, This is not like Malaria or Filaria, dengue mosquitoes can breed in even in the smallest places. We also found that 80 percent of breeding sites are within homes not outside, so people need to pay more attention. In addition, one ministry alone cannot do this, all should come together and waste management should go hand in hand here, Senaratne said.

Dengue mosquitoes now use new breeding grounds
The latest entomological surveys reveal that dengue mosquitoes have changed their usual breeding places and now breed inside homes and gutters,Entomologists Association President Najith Sumanasena said.
Sumanasena said dengue mosquitoes now breed in places located inside homes such as small water containers placed to prevent ants, refrigerators and pets drinking water containers.
Dengue mosquitoes breed where their future generation can easily find food. Now their selection is inside homes and gutters, he said. The fine for dengue mosquito breeding places located in construction sites should be increased because it is another common breeding place for dengue mosquitoes, he said.
Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said there are around 40,000 quack doctors in the country at the moment and they make it more difficult for the dengue patients to recover. They prescribe medications such as `Ibuprofen for fever patients to bring down fever fast and gain popularity as one shot. Dengue patients should only take paracetamol. Other medications cause fatal complications such as Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), Dengue Shock Syndrome and they die, he said.

Designing your clients dream home
Archt. Sunil Lamahewa has coupled conventional architectural thinking with philosophy. ArchWorld features Archt. Susil Lamahewa whose effectiveness is at its best when his mind is at peace.
Anything and everything is different all the time because Everything in the world is in the process of changing. Anything and everything is different all the time because Everything in the world is in the process of changing. As there is no permanent, unchanging substance. Nothing passes from one moment to the next. This is a quote from the book - What the Buddha Taught by Walpola Rahula. This applies to the material world or the physical world, said Lamahewa.
To identify the taste of people is not that easy, your client needs to be fully understood when you are designing a home for him. His way of thinking, likes and dislikes, kind of life, social background, education what exactly will fit him, all need to be taken into consideration.
Therefore understanding a clients taste is not that easy in this part of the world. So I visit a client a couple of times and move with him, talk / discuss about art and his living style. After a few meetings and visiting the site with him I get a glimpse of his tastes that needs to be identified and understood, stated Lamahewa
Taste cannot be explained; therefore we need to experience the taste. Your design will be based on the taste of the user, then only will it become a unique place.
This doesnt mean that typical housing or mass housing is a failure, but the interior of the volumes can be transformed to a desired place. The user should feel it with the spaces in it. The sequences of interlinked spaces should talk to the user, making him feel comfortable within the vividly created volumes. The house or building should be fit to live in harmony and in peace, said Lamahewa
Lamahewa says the Sun is mother of all energy in the earth.
Sun shine has become part of our lives as architects. We use the sunlight to enhance the function of built spaces during the day time. In tropical countries sun light needs to be controlled and in cold countries we need to take sun as much as possible into the designed spaces based on the requirement. It would be magical to use the morning sun, afternoon sun and evening sun in one space to create different moods at various times of the day. The craft of channeling the sun into spaces will determine the mood. This mood setting is determined by the natural light and the direction of the sun. One can achieve it with other architectural design elements if used correctly.
The quality of sunlight and its direction can be used as a design element/ a design principle. The materials that receive the sunlight, gives color, and reflection of light off the surfaces will illuminate the spaces. The textures and colors of material surfaces will enhance the volume of space. Material surfaces and colors play a major role in articulation of the built volumes, explained Lamahewa.
When you get sunlight into the spaces it comes with heat as well. It is light and heat. You may have to control it or filter or defuse it to the level that you need to. In tropics sunlight is controlled by long eaves, smaller opening and thick walls.
Ventilation also can be controlled by varying the size of openings, directions and its locations. The best examples are houses with verandahs and courtyards. If the control of light, temperature and ventilation can be combined into the built spaces as required by design, they may stay as timeless designs provided that the spaces are in order to satisfy the user, added Lamahewa.
Using wind and controlling it in buildings makes the ventilation happen.
Air has to be circulated or changed. The natural ventilation is the best and its free of charge. You only need to be creative enough to handle it carefully. Here we get two monsoons where you get wind and rain together. Therefor the orientation of your buildings are so important. The interiors of the building get heated up due to various reasons - Blocking of natural ventilation, heat emitted by cooking and other works, heat emitted by occupants and heat transfers through openings and walls, said Lamahewa.
Experiencing nature is probably the best healer- for a tired mind. You may call it stress.
When designing spaces we can experience nature, by connecting interior spaces to the outside world at least by vistas (using a hole in the wall is the beginning of this). So the answer to this may be an open house. The use of a courtyard or sky lights might add to the design, but it has to evolve with the concept and the design. These linking elements to nature will enhance the creation, said Lamahewa.
Orientation of the house and use of exposed materials are very important, while play of small and large spaces makes the composition of a design better.
The landscape and interior of the place also matter adding beauty and enhancing the spaces. Your built space does not change but landscape changes every day, stated Lamahewa.
Color and lighting certainly will change the moods. Colors have meanings. Lighting on colored surfaces will change the atmosphere drastically if not used properly. There are deep theories on those areas.
In todays context with the advancement of technology, now we are passing through the Information Era. Information matters now. Think freely, take time to think, read, listen, travel and enjoy thoroughly what you are doing. Do not fear to use new materials after careful analysis of them at the right place and in the right time. Remember architecture is for people. I believe if a client is understood by the architect, the architect will be able to tap into his mindset and he will be able to create the desired spaces of the client. Based on the requirement it will be for today as well as the future, shared Lamahewa.
Lamahewa certainly loves his job.
I do not get stressed because I love designing. I am in a happy mood when I am involved in a design. I am always engaged in something related to it. When I feel like my brain is tired I meditate a little. But now I listen to music or go on an outing with my camera. Sometimes I read something totally irrelevant to my field or look at my numismatic collection. Meditation helps a lot for clear thinking and recharging. If there is no peace of mind and no proper thinking it will lead to a bad design. Design for someone cannot be done mechanically, its like composing a piece of music, or making a piece of art, explained Lamahewa.
Well, large projects have large problems while small projects have small problems. But design wise both will have same parameters to meet.
The Architects responsibility is the same, immaterial to the size of the project. Sometimes you need to get together with some others to deliver a large project and it becomes a collective approach and team work. The process is the same, huge projects also need to be designed by an architect. It may be a large complex of low rise clusters or hi-rise buildings with a small foot print. The amounts of the design problems are the same, its only the size that has changed. Architect cannot create it alone. The creation is formed with many others input. Other building professionals, contractors, skilled workers and un- skilled workers. Everybodys contribution is required by an architect to make his dream a reality for his client, summed up Lamahewa.

Eat or be eaten: winning the merger endgame in Asian healthcare
Overview
A birds eye view of the global healthcare landscape reveals a market in consolidation and the implications for Asia are well worth considering.
In 2016, healthcare mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity worldwide topped approximately US$ 320 billion.
With 169 deals valued at approximately US$ 29 billion, Asia accounted for 9% of the global pie. For some healthcare players, the endgame might be more apparent than others: If youre not at the table, youre on the menuor worse still, on your way out.
Back in 2008, Chinese medical device manufacturer Shenzhen Goldway Industrial found itself on the menu, when Phillips snapped it up in a bid to solidify its place in the patient monitoring market.
Fast forward a couple of years and Asia-based providers are increasingly at the table making their own cross-border bids.
With an eat or be eaten narrative at play, should Asian health providers increasingly look to the acquisitions bandwagon to stay competitive Whether through local or cross-border deals, the question is a pressing one, both for the C-suite in healthcare and investors.
The Consolidation Lifecycle
According to the merger endgames theory posited by A.T. Kearney researchers, the answer depends on where a particular industry falls in a four-stage consolidation lifecycle. The theory- which is based on an analysis of approximately 25,000 companies across 24 industries globally - suggests that all industries will journey through the same four stages over an approximately 25-year period.
The companies that fare well in the long term are reportedly the ones that take a proactive role in driving their industrys consolidation - the so-called endgame.
The idea is simple. If it is possible to understand the defining traits of each stage in the consolidation lifecycle, a business should undertake every major strategic and operational move in line with their place in a particular industry and the industrys stage in the overall consolidation trajectory.
This sounds promising in theory, but what does it mean
Stage 1: An industry is said to open with a single start-up or a monopoly resulting from deregulation or privatization. Initially, industry concentration stands at 100% but as competitors make swift inroads, the market quickly becomes fragmented.
Players at this initial stage are focused on making inroads, with no real rationale for consolidation.
Stage 2: With the passage of time, players in the industry switch towards building scale and the Top Three come to hold 15-45% of the market.
This is a stage of rapid consolidation as larger players absorb smaller targets in their effort to create empires.
Stage 3: By this stage, players in the industry are focused on developing their core business and outpacing the competition, with the Top Three claiming 35%70% of the market.
Unlike the previous phase when larger companies acquired weaker targets, Stage 3 is all about megadeals and large-scale consolidation.
Stage 4: During the balance and alliance stage, the Top Three companies control 70%90% of the market.
This is a stage when further consolidation is either limited or non-existent, whether due to antitrust concerns or industry complexity. Instead, companies operating in these industries must defend their leading positions.
Application of the Consolidation Lifecycle
Within the global healthcare landscape, the concern is that consolidation decisions dont pan out as planned, partly due to poor timing.
For Asian providers particularly, the need of the hour is to build strategy around the stage of the industry in which they operate.
What might it look like if the consolidation lifecycle was applied to some of these players
Stage 1: Regenerative Medicine in Japan
In Japan, regenerative therapies are a good example of a Stage 1 industry, owing to a new legal framework for cell-based and tissue-based therapies that went into effect in November 2014expediting the development and conditional approval of products that demonstrate safety and probable efficacy.
Japanese corporations such as Cyberdyne and Healios K.K. are increasingly investigating opportunities to bring regenerative therapies to market, even as foreign companies - like Australian regenerative medicine business Mesoblast - look at more partnership deals in Japan.
According to the consolidation lifecycle, the right move for companies in Stage 1 industries is to aggressively defend their first-mover advantage by building scale, developing a global footprint and protecting proprietary technology and ideas.
The idea is to focus on earning revenue and amassing market share, particularly before competitors encroach upon the opportunity.
If the consolidation lifecycle is to be believed, it is still too early for players in this stage to consider acquisitive activity as a viable strategic move.
Stage 2: Pharmaceuticals Sector in Japan, China and India
A sampling of recent deal activity in Asia suggests that the pharmaceuticals sector is a good example of a Stage 2 industry where players have been focused on building scale.
In the three years leading up to 30 June 2016, approximately 388 healthcare deals transpired in Asia. Amongst these, approximately 125 deals were in the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology spacewith approximately 70% of acquisitive activity involving companies based in Japan, China and India.
In Japans Big Pharma market, the bulk of large-scale consolidation took place in the past decade, involving companies like Astellas and Takeda.
Lately, Indian pharma giants like Torrent Pharmaceuticals have also been busy swallowing up smaller players. In Torrents case, these acquisitions have been a means of enhancing their standing as a manufacturer of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) for regulated markets.
In China, most recent deal activity has involved domestic players in Chinese herbals and natural medicine.
A Stage 2 industry is one that has found its bearings - front-runners in such industries typically enjoy a stable income stream and entrenched customer relationships.
At this point, it makes sense to build scale. As such, Stage 2 is characterized by larger players regularly absorbing smaller targets.
On the flip side, companies that opt to sit out the M&A wave can grow increasingly vulnerable to being eaten.
Achieving a calibrated fit in terms of acquisitions may be pivotal for businesses that do not wish to be overtaken in a Stage 2 industry.
Stage 3: In-Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) Market in China
Globally, the IVD industry has been rather deal-oriented with approximately 240 acquisitions between 2012 and October 2015.
With in-vitro diagnostics influencing over 60% of clinical decision-making, this is a market that appears to be switching from Stage 2 to Stage 3 in China - with foreign players driving the endgame rather than homegrown companies.
International companies currently account for approximately 75% of the Chinese market, with Roche (approximately 20%) dominating the space.
For players in Stage 3, the strategic priority is to enhance their core business and outpace the competition via large-scale consolidation plays.
The goal is no longer the acquisition of smaller targets but mergers of equals. Over the past 2 years, Roche in particular has embarked on a string of acquisitions in order to ensure that the company has an end-to-end value proposition that meets the needs of customers in the clinical sequencing arena.
In future, the company is likely to shift towards larger-scale plays in the region. By comparison, it would appear that homegrown Chinese players in the IVD space have already lost the merger endgame.
Stage 4: Private Hospitals in Singapore
Singapores private hospital space is on the cusp of transition from Stage 3 to Stage 4.
While large companies operating in Stage 3 of the industry lifecycle tend to focus on outpacing the competition via large-scale consolidation plays, such players eventually transition into Stage 4 Grandmasters whose priority it is to defend their leading positions.
IHH Healthcare Berhadthe 2012 IPO-ed offspring of Singapores Parkway and Malaysias Pantaiis a solid example of a merger of equals that is pushing Singapores private hospital market towards Stage 4. In 2012, IHH alone commanded approximately 44% of licenced beds and approximately 70% of revenues across Singapore.
With approximately 10,000 licenced beds in 52 hospitals across 10 countries and a market value of approximately US$ 14.2 billion in 2016, IHH also tops the regions healthcare providers in market value.
Companies like IHH that lead in Stage 4 industries have the potential to be successful for a long time depending on how they handle their position.
So What
Ultimately, the merger endgames theory or consolidation lifecycle has its limitations in terms of the precision with which it can explain an industrys trajectory over time and the behavior of companies within these industries.
The real value of the consolidation lifecycle, however, is as one of several frameworks for strategic thinking. Health conglomerates can also leverage this knowledge in order to optimize their aggregate portfolio of subsidiaries and business units across the different endgame stages. Not every player can lead the consolidation endgame but there is much to be learned by tracking the progress of Endgame winners, like Roche and IHH Healthcare.

Fate of 1978 Constitution structure
The Manifesto of 1977 General Elections of the UNP, headed by J.R. Jayewardene, sought mandate from the people inter-alia to draft, adopt and operate a new Republican Constitution in order to achieve the goals of a democratic social society.
The UNP Manifesto declared that We shall include in the Constitution the Basic Principles accepted by the 1975 Party Sessions with reference to religion and language and among them being the guaranteeing to the people their Fundamental Rights, Privileges and Freedoms, re-establishing the independence of the Press and the Judiciary and freeing it from political control and interference.
The Manifesto further declared to ensure in the Constitution that every citizen, whether he belongs to a majority or minority, racial, religious or caste group enjoys equal and basic human rights and opportunities...
No new Constitution but revision
However, the UNP did not take steps to enact a New Constitution in terms of its Manifesto. The UNP had on September 22, 1977, long before the commencement of the Second Republican Constitution, presented to the National State Assembly the Second Amendment to the First Republican Constitution.
By that amendment, JR became the first Executive President and styled himself as the President elected by the People of Sri Lanka. Thus, the Second Amendment had entirely changed the constitutional character of the First Republican Constitution.
Thereafter, a Resolution was moved in the National State Assembly on October 20, 1977 to set up a Select Committee to consider the revision of the Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka and other written laws as the Committee may consider necessary.
Thus, the Speaker with the Prime Minister as the Chairman, constituted a Select Committee on the Revision of the Constitution. The Select Committee formulated a questionnaire and was published in the newspapers. Evidence was also heard by the Select Committee. When the deliberations were reaching the final stage by the Select Committee, it was announced that a new Constitution would be replaced, repealing the First Republican Constitution. Accordingly, the Second Republican Constitution was adopted and enacted.
Any amendment of the Constitution, an offence
JR desired the Second Republican Constitution to be in force for many decades and the UNP to govern the country for many years without interruption. To achieve this end, he brought a Clause in the draft Constitution.
The special Clause that JR inserted clearly stated as follows: Any person who advocates, attempts, abets, instigates, participates or engages in any conspiracy for the amendment, whether by way of alteration or addition or replacement of the Constitution or any provision thereof otherwise than in accordance with the provision of Chapter XII, shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction by a High Court after trial without a jury be liable to imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten years or a fine or both and shall forfeit all his property.
Professor Wade
Professor Wade having looking at the Special Clause in the 1978 Constitutional Draft Bill made his observation in the series lectures,  Hamlyn Lectures that a prize for bizarre forms of entrenchment must be awarded for Sri Lanka. His lectures helped many internal communities to express strong condemnation against the Special Clause. There was strong opposition to the inclusion of this clause in the Constitution.
Even the prominent members of the UNP made hue and cry. JR abandoned the aforesaid Clause and introduced another Clause in the Constitution and made it difficult for any amendment of the Constitution or replacement by another new Constitution without following the procedure prescribed of Articles 82 (5) and (6) of the Constitution.
Inclusion of New Article
Long, long ambition of JR had long, long wish. So, he sought to insert a new clause to effectively prevent the amendment, alteration of his Constitution difficult. He included Article 82 (5) and (6) in the Constitution.
Article 82 (5) reads thus:
A Bill for the amendment of any provision of the Constitution or for the repeal and replacement of the Constitution, shall become law if the number of votes cast in favour thereof amounts to not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present) and upon a certificate by the President or the Speaker, as the case may, being endorsed thereon in accordance the provisions of Article 80 or 79. In addition to the approval of Parliament by two-thirds majority, it requires approval from the People at a Referendum.
Article 82 (6) reads thus:
No provision in any law shall, or shall be deemed to, amend, repeal or replace the Constitution or any provision thereof, or be so interpreted or construed, unless enacted in accordance with the requirements of the preceding provisions this Article.
After the second year of presidency, JR desired to have another term but he did not have shrewd advisers to seek judicial interpretations and to amend the Constitution as the able President Rajapaksa has been counseled, enabling him to seek office as President for many times.
Though JR wanted UNP in power for decades but he was made to witness that all his political manipulations and manoevures failing and Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga entering the presidential race and receiving more than 64 percentage of the votes polled at the Presidential Election. JR had to silently witness Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga becoming the President and her mother, Mrs. Bandaranaike becoming Prime Minister.
From time to time public pronouncements were made to abolish the executive Presidency but so far no one translated the noble cause into action. The President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga presented a draft Constitution in 2000. There were agitations and protests by the political parties against her new draft Constitution. Maha Sangha strongly opposed the draft Constitution of 2000, stating that it was compromising the unitary character of the State of Sri Lanka and she was forced to drop down the draft Constitution.
On January 8, 2015 political mayhem took place. The War Hero, President Mihinda Rajapaksa was thrown out and his, one time, General Secretary and Minister, Maithripala Sirisena was elected President.
He and his supporters openly pronounced that the Executive Presidency would be abolished and so many other good things and matters were declared to be done but so far none of them are executed as the cohorts of the former President are still in Parliament and preventing President Maithripala Sirisena from carrying out his promises, made at the Presidential Election. For example, 19th Amendment was passed with seventy amendments being moved by UPFA, supporting the former President.
In any way, all these Amendments would not change the structural character of JRs Constitution.
JR has achieved his ambition to have his executive presidency for more than three decades. It appears that his ambition may continue for several more decades without anyone to bell his constitution.

Foreigners free to invest in SL: Radhakrishnan
Foreigners need not be afraid to invest in Sri Lanka to uplift the livelihood of the flood-affected people and travel around Sri Lanka without any restrictions, said Education State Minister V. Radhakrishnan.
He said so speaking at the unveiling ceremony of the eight-foot Thiruvalluvar statue at Pillaiyarady at the Batticaloa Tamil Sangam premises, entrance of the Batticaloa town along the Batticaloa-Trincomalee highway, Tuesday evening.
Sixteen such statues were gifted to Sri Lanka by the VGP World Tamil Sangam President Dr. V.G.Santhosam. The ceremony was organized by Batticaloa Tamil Sangam and was presided over by M. Ganesharaja. He further said that to prove that foreigners could go about anywhere without any hindrance, he was taking the Indian Delegation around to various parts of the island where similar statues were unveiled.
This is a further step to promoting Indo-Sri Lankan relationship; by these there is enough potential for Indian culture, fine arts, music, theatre, dance and drama to influence Sri Lanka. The relationship between the Tamils of South India and Sri Lanka will be strengthened.
I appeal to investors to visit Sri Lanka and start ventures that will increase the livelihood facilities of the affected people in North and East. Replicas of the eight-foot statue were handed over to the Batticaloa District TNA Parliamentarians S. Srinesan, S. Yogeswaran, S. Viyalendran, Ampara District TNA Parliamentarian K. Kodeeswaran and Batticaloa District Government Agent P.S.M. Charles by Dr. Santhosam.

Lead by the ideas and efforts of Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Champika Ranawaka, Waters Edge Chairman, Chamath De Silva and General Manager Rohan Fernandopulle, the groundbreaking ceremony was also attended by officials from the Urban Development Authority and Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation.
Speaking at the event Waters Edge Chairman Chamath De Silva said, The expansion of the banquets facilities at Waters Edge is twofold. On one hand we will expand our space offering on each of the four floors. On the other hand we are also concentrating heavily on ensuring that service delivery at banquets is enhanced as well.

Greats lament sad day as Kohli topples Kumble
New Delhi: Batting great Sunil Gavaskar lamented a sad day on Wednesday after Anil Kumble stepped down as India coach over a rift with captain Virat Kohli, leaving the hotseat vacant once again.
Kumble said his position was untenable after Kohli questioned his leadership style and told the Indian board he had reservations about the spin legend extending his one-year stay.
Since Duncan Fletcher left in March 2015, India, currently the worlds top Test team, have struggled for stability with Ravi Shastri and Sanjay Bangar both taking on temporary roles before Kumbles reign.
I have very little knowledge about the differences between Virat and Anil. But it is a really sad day for Indian cricket, Gavaskar told NDTV.
India have won everything since the time Anil took over, he added. I cant see Anil doing much wrong in one year. Differences (can) happen in any team but see the results.
India suffered a humiliating defeat to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy final on Sunday, but Kumble also helped them reclaim the number-one Test ranking and maintained an unblemished record in five Test series. Former India captain and coach Bishan Singh Bedi also signalled his disappointment, tweeting: If theres more intelligent/committed Crkt analyser than @anilkumble 1074 on Indn horizon (we are) ignorant really!
Kumble, 46, had already appeared headed for the exit after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) advertised for a new coach last month, although he was an automatic candidate.
Former captain Virender Sehwag and Australias Tom Moody are reported to be among the possible replacements for Kumble, whose contract ran out after the Champions Trophy.
Sambit Bal, editor in chief of ESPNCricinfo.com, said the manner of Kumbles exit set an unwelcome precedent for Indian cricket.
I think that sets a bad precedent really... its really a case where the BCCI has backed the captain over the coach, he said.
The message is sent out to the next coach: fall into line or else, added Bal. A three-man panel of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman, who picked Kumble in June last year, will deliberate over Kumbles replacement.
As well as Sehwag and Moody, other candidates are Englishman Richard Pybus, who has coached Pakistan and Bangladesh, former India manager Lalchand Rajput and ex-paceman Dodda Ganesh.
An Indian Express column said the pressures of modern cricket demanded a strong chain of command.
Giving veto powers to the captain and players over coaches sits at odds with the direction cricket is moving in, the column said.
Indian cricket has once again endorsed that captain is more important than a coach, it added. AFP

## Title: HASHAN fielder par excellence
## Supertitle:

HASHAN fielder par excellence
He can best be described as a once in a lifetime cricketer. He was brilliant where ever on the field be it wicket keeping, slip fielding, fielding in the outfield or close in almost kissing distance to the batsman and the era when Sri Lankas cricket was beginning to be a threat and make other countries playing cricket take notice. HASHAN PRASANTHA TILLEKERATNE falls into that rare breed.
A brilliant fielder is important and essential, than a brilliant batsman or a bowler. My coaches at St. Benedicts College, Edward Kelaart and Bertie Wijesinha used to lay special emphasis and stress on us how important it is to have a brilliant fielder in the team. Given the option these coaches would always plonk for a brilliant fielder. The importance of this need not be reiterated. How many coaches will believe in this aspect today
From the time he took to the game at D.S. Senanayake College, the College that gave the famous Aravinda de Silva to the game, TILLEKERATNE showed his natural instincts, or god given instincts as an excellent fielder and what an eye-catching display he showed to the world with his marvelous fielding. Today there is no better sight than seeing a brilliant fielder at work.
Tillekeratne an all in one
With TILLEKERATNE in the team, it had a 14-member attack force. In addition to his determined left hand batting, he was fielder, wicket keeper and also bowler. Any coach, captain, team or country will love and yearn to have a all in one an like the irrepressible TILLEKERATNE. Today no country could boast of a gem of a cricketer like TILLEKERATNE. Why coaches dont stress on their youngsters to emulate the deeds of players like TILLEKERATNE is inexplicable.
The writer was privy to witness TILLEKRATNES feats in the game. And there is one particular incident that was unique and rare and not likely to be repeated. The writer was in the company of that storehouse of knowledge and who has one of the best cricket libraries in the world--Walter Asoka Atapattu in Wellington, New Zealand watching that Test and the incident was this.
In a Test match in Wellington against New Zealand, Captain Martin Crowe who is sadly no more, was on the way to a milestone becoming the first Kiwi to score a triple hundred. He batted brilliantly to stall Sri Lankas victory push and was on 299 when to call it a cricking miracle would not be wrong was witnessed.
Signed, Sealed and delivered
With the game, signed, sealed and delivered as a draw and only the triple hundred, if it happened to savor, Crowe sliced a ball in the slip region and wended his way to the pavilion not bothering to look back certain that it was going to take him to the dream figure of 300. TILLEKERATNE keeping wickets dived goalie like to almost second slip to gobble the catch and Crowe turning back hoping to see the ball reach the boundary stood dumb stuck as TILLEKERATNE gloved the ball off a innocuous Arjuna Ranatunga delivery. That catch is still etched in my memory.
TILLEKERATNE was rubber like. He would stretch, dive and lunge and he was fearless and excelled, especially fielding close to the batsman and several were the bat pad catches he clung on which were unbelievable. He was yards better than Indias Eknath Solkar in this position. In a Test match against New Zealand at the SSC in the 1990/91 series he plucked seven catches that equaled the world record.
On Solkar and to recall a sad incident. Maharaja Organisation who were the Maharajas in the Mercantile cricket scene when Mercantile cricket was the showpiece of the game at that time were touring India taking part in the Moin-ud-Dowlah tournament in Hyderabad.


Hamer the irrepressible
Russel Hamer the irrepressible Wesley College and Maharaja left handed batting ace and wicket keeper who played for the country and who made the switch hit famous, played one such stroke that caught Solkar unawares flush on the face and he left the field bleeding, never again to field in that famous position of his for his country. I was privy to that incident covering that tour for the Times Group of Newspapers. That Maharaja team had a local boy Gehan Mendis scoring heavily in country cricket playing for Tony Greigs county team Sussex and who Greig was convinced should play for England. But that was not to be. That was the era when snobs ran English cricket.
Like Sanath Jayasuriya who used to feast on bowlers hitting sixes with gay abandon  217- in all formats of the game, TILLEKERATNE used to gobble catches, mostly fielding in his pet position close to the batsmen and believe it or not taking 211 catches. A record to savor.
After a successful run at D.S. Senanayake College where he served notice of his immense talent scoring heavily, he joined the Nondescripts Cricket Club where he was fortunate to come under the expert guidance of former Benedictine and wicket keeper batsman Ranjit Fernando and my team mate who donned wicket keeping gloves for the country taking over from Asias best wicket keeper batsman at that time H.I.K. Fernando and excelling as an opening batsman. Fernando polished the little flaws that TILLEKERATNE had in his game and the end product as his career progressed- a CHAMPION - in the big league for the country.
Resolve and resilience
TILLEKERATNE too like all good cricketers who suffer a glitch has experienced his hills and valleys when he had the ignominy of being dropped for poor form. But with grit, resolve ad resilience, he cocked a snook at his detractors and came back to do his bit for game and country which is history now.
As a 19-year old he got his first break called up to don pads against England B at Galle and made that game the rock on which he built his career with a three-figure score that saved the teams blushes and made the selectors take note of his future in Sri Lanka cricket. He later achieved the dream of any sportsman and that is to captain the country. He realized that dream. Lack of space permits me from singing more of his praises. But his records briefed below says it all. He was a cricketer any captain would have yearned to have in the team.
Having said that now to his other attributes.
His career stats for the record  he played for the country from 1986 to 2004. TEST DEBUT  December 16,1989 v Australia. LAST MATCH March 24, v Australia. ODI DEBUT 27, November 1986 v India.

Hemas commemorates World Environment Day with Otara
The staff of Hemas Holdings recently commemorated World Environment Day 2017 with Otara Gunawardena.
Speaking on this years global theme Connecting People to Nature. Her inspiring address to the audience was based on her personal experience on environmental issues Sri Lanka faces in the current context.
She spoke of her strong sense of patriotism in declaring herself primarily as a Sri Lankan irrespective of all the labels she has been associated with. She described the sense of worth in being called a Sri Lankan and hastened to emphasise the plight of the environment, which has taken a toll on the natural beauty and landscape of this country.
I believe we are at a critical point in time in Sri Lanka, where we have pushed the natural world too far, and are now suffering the consequences. I think this is only the beginning of more severe environmental impacts that we will have to face, if we continue to do the same thing and travel the same path as we have done before, she said.
World Environment Day is only a symbolic day to commemorate what nature has given us. We need to take this concept forward by living it on a daily basis, by doing the right thing and respecting nature. Living with nature should be a way of life. As a Company we are committed to minimising our impact on the environment and encourage all our staff to be sensitive to the environment around us, said Shiromi Masakorala, General Manager Group, Sustainability and Corporate Communications.
Hemas parallely commemorated the day with special events organised at all locations across the Group. The Companys Abhimana Champions played an instrumental role here in taking the message to their colleagues across the companys different sectors. A one-minute AV by Julia Roberts (in English and Sinhala) was screened at all locations to communicate that nature does not need people but that people need nature.
This was followed by an inspiring speech made by a staff member at each location where a tree was also planted to mark World Environment Day 2017
All members of Hemas staff took a solemn pledge to immediately refrain from using plastic lunch sheets. They also unequivocally agreed to totally stop using plastic bottles both at home and at their workplace.
This was also in remembrance of those who lost their lives in the Meethotamulla garbage dump tragedy.
The Club works closely with the Elephant Transit Home (ETH) at Udawala where two years ago a baby elephant named Abhiman by the Club. This is in line with the Hemas Sustainability Philosophy of Abhimana.
The Club has also developed the ETH website and produced four documentaries with the sponsorship of Hemas Leisure, Travel and Aviation sectors.

History of Sri Lankan football
With the FFSL AGM around the corner it will be pertinent to recall the history of football in Sri Lanka. Few forget the glorious moments of football in the past and remember the part played by officials for the upliftment of the game. The name of Manilal Fernando should not be forgotten for his contribution to football. FFSL has a "Football House" with all the facilities, and the Baddegana grounds due to his efforts. A stadium was promised in Kandy, at Dangolla but now four years have gone and nothing has happened.
Football is the one of the most popular sports in the world today, but sad to say Sri Lankan football has taken a back seat. It is the British who introduced the game to the Americas, Europe, and Asia through their battalions, regiments and brigades. It is not possible to know exactly, when football was introduced to Sri Lanka. However, there is evidence of the game being played on the Galle Face Green, by bare chested British Servicemen stationed in and around Colombo in the 1890s.
The service barrack grounds at Echelon Square (where the Galadari Hotel is presently situated) and the Sports Club grounds (presently the Taj Samudra Hotel) were the popular football fields in the games formative years. British service units such as the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, Royal Engineers, Royal Artillery and the Royal Garrison Command were the pioneers who promoted competitive football here. British administrative service and the British planting community took the sport to the Central, Up-country and Southern regions. By early 1900 football as a competitive sport, was popular amongst the local youth. Though playing bare footed, our lads mastered the skills, and in fact, donned the Service jerseys as replacements or reserves in many an exclusively white dominated game.
The first ever attempt to organize and conduct Association Football in Ceylon was when the Colombo Association Football League was formed at a meeting held in the Bristol Hotel, Colombo on April 4, 1911. H. French was elected President with H. K. Crosskey as Secretary. However, as a result of the World War in 1914, this body understandably became inactive and ineffective.
After a lapse of nine years, the Colombo Association Football League was revived and re-constituted in 1920 under the amended name, Colombo Football League, with Herbert Dowbiggin as president and H. French as chairman. By 1924 Sir John Tarbat, that evergreen sportsman, became president and contributed immensely to the promotion of the game in the years that followed.
Southern Province - In the Southern Province, the sport had a fair impact on the masses, with the planting and administrative community leading in the promotion of the game in a big way. R. Brough, a British planter in Deniyaya, contributed much to the sport in the South between 1910 to 1920. The British servicemen from the Navy wireless station in Matara also helped to popularize the sport, particularly in the southern schools. The first football club formed in the south was the Galle Association Football Club in 1910, with obviously a predominantly British membership. R. R. Brough was its first president and the club team was captained by A. C. Blair.
Central Province - Kandy, the hill capital of Sri Lanka, had its baptism in football in the mid-1930s. During the Second World War, British units were stationed in Kandy, with the one-time Commander in Chief of the Allied Forces in the South East Asia, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten having his headquarters in the hill capital. Later on Kandy Amateur Football League was formed with M. S. Jainudeen as the kingpin. It subsequently changed its name to Kandy District Football Association. It served football in Matale, Gampola, Nawalapitiya, Kurunegala and Kegalle, as the years rolled by these towns formed their own associations. Today sad that football in Kandy has been allowed to go into limbo.
Northern Province - Almost at the same time the British planters, technocrats and civil servicemen were spreading the gospel of football in the Western, Central and Southern provinces. The North too, came under their spell with a flourish of football activity amongst the local populace. School leavers and young government servants were grouping together to form football clubs, so early as the mid-thirties. In fact, on 8 November 1939 to be exact, the Jaffna Football Association was formed with W. G. Spencer, District Judge, as chairman. This historic meeting took place at the Jaffna YMCA with B. E. Rajanayagam as the elected secretary. Football in the northern peninsula is as old as football in Sri Lanka, and always remained active and vibrant until the outbreak of ethnic violence in 1983.
North Central Province - Rajarata, the place of kings and palaces, and one of scenic beauty and tranquility, is also a province full of recreation and sport. Anuradhapura the ancient capital of Sri Lanka is a center of activity, both cultural and recreational and football naturally taken pride of place. The origin of football in the North Central Province is no different to that of the rest of the country. The influence of the British civil servants had been at the base of its growth. These Britishers, with the assistance of the local youth, played football more as a recreation than in competition, in a ground close to the venerated Ruwanveli Seya.
History will not be complete if appreciation is not recorded of the encouragement and assistance extended to the sport by our Heads of State such as D. S. Senanayake, Dudley Senanayake, Sir John Kotalawela, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, J. R. Jayewardene, R. Premadasa, Chandrika Kumaratunga Bandaranaike, Mahinda Rajapaksa, and the present President Mathripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who are all keen followers of the game.
The singular contribution to football by R. Premadasa needs no elaboration. The re-development of the Sugathadasa Stadium shall stand as a living monument to his unremitting devotion and sincere admiration.

Immediate steps to fill islandwide teacher vacancies
Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam instructed top officials of his Ministry to take early steps to recruit subject teachers for the existing vacancies at 352 national schools countrywide. Meanwhile, the minister decided to recruit qualified school principals for the vacancies at national schools. 
Since permanent principals are not available presently at nearly 210 national schools, acting school principals are covering the duties of principals in those national schools now. It was reported that many of them have not obtained required qualifications or experience to hold these posts. Hence, steps should be taken to replace them with qualified personnel in the near future.
About 1,500 graduates are to be recruited to be employed at provincial and remote schools of both, Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the NWP, said Kurunegala Senior Director of Education W.M.Balasooriya, speaking at a meeting of school principals held at Wariyapola Teachers Training Resources Centre, Kurunegala, yesterday.

Infant dies after heart operation
Surgery beyond paediatrician's ken:
A two-month-old infant had died after being subjected to a hole-in-the-heart operation without the knowledge or observation of a Consultant Paediatrician, Karapitiya Teaching Hospital sources said.
The infant had been transferred to Karapitiya from Anuradhapura and died after the operation last week.
A high official of the hospital who claimed anonymity said a surgery of this nature is performed after stopping the heart and connecting the patient to a heart machine. The maximum time for using the heart machine was about an hour. This child had died because the infant had been connected to the heart machine for nearly three hours. The operation had been performed by a foreign surgeon of about 74 years with the assistance of a lady doctor without the knowledge of the Consultant Cardiologist of the hospital. Paediatric Cardiologist Dr. Mangala Gunatilleke said they had been informed about the admission of the child. But the surgery had been performed without his knowledge.
He was also not informed about a visiting surgeon handling the surgery. Hospital's Director Dr. Jayampathy Senanayake admitted that the child had died after the operation. But, nothing illegal had happened regarding the surgery, he said. The foreign surgeon was working with the approval of the Health Ministry.

Law should be equal to all: Rajitha
Co-Cabinet Spokesperson,Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne said that the law should apply equally to all.
The Minister was addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing yesterday.
Minister Rajitha Senaratne responding to allegations that there was a plot to wipe out the Sinhala race said these accusations were baseless.
The complaints that doctors are trying to make the Sinhala or Muslim race barren is nothing but lies. Any gynaecologist gives advice to the mother on the number of children she could comfortably have without having any health implications, while also not affecting the economy of the family. If the parents cannot feed all their children properly, we have issues of malnutrition,the Health Minister.
There is a certain system followed by doctors when parting such advice. It is part of the governments family planning program of Punchi Pawula Raththaran (the small family is golden,he added.
Senaratne further stressed that there was no chance of ethnic violence breaking out in the country as the President and Prime Minister have decreed that rigorous imprisonment without bail should be instituted for such incidents.
Meanwhile, Police Spokesperson DIG Priyantha Jayakody said arresting a Buddhist leader and politically linked monk is totally different to arresting a layman, Police Spokesperson DIG Priyantha Jayakody was explaining as to why the four teams deployed to arrest Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera failed to do so.
DIG Jayakody explained that even if the teams found the Bodu Bala Sena leaders hideouts, they could not search a temple due to cultural reasons, We can easily get a warrant to check a civilian place but it is different when it comes to checking a temple.There are cultural conflicts,he said.
He however added that the recent surrender was due to Police pressure exerted on the monk.
As worries over ethnic tensions rise, the Police Spokesperson said they had received 21 complaints of hate speech against Ven.Gnanasara Thera, Minister Rishard Bathuideen and Northern Provincial Council member M.K. Sivajilingam and that the Organized Crimes Division was investigating into all the complaints in a methodical manner.we are looking to find the
legal basis in all these complaints and seek the AGs advice to ascertain whether these speeches contained any inflammatory statements that might affect ethnic harmony, the DIG said. Apart from hate speech, the Police have also recorded 14 criminal offenses in the form of attacks on religious institutions. Thus far 15 have been arrested with 12 being Sinhalese, two Muslims and a Tamil.

Let bygones, be bygones
Now, it is not often that events in the North make headlines in the rest of the country although they regularly did, ten years ago, when the war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was at its peak. Last week however, the North again ground to a halt as hartals were held in support of Northern Provincial Council (NPC) Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran.
Chief Minister Wigneswaran was embroiled in a spat with his party, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and particularly with its leader, Leader of the Opposition, R. Sampanthan. While the latest dispute which has now been resolved- at least for the time being- has been the most divisive among their differences, the parting of ways between the veteran politician and the former Supreme Court judge had been in the making for some time.
The NPC came into being only in 2013, although provincial councils were created in the rest of Sri Lanka in 1987 under the Indo-Lanka Accord. That is because, under the Accord, the Northern and Eastern provinces were merged, forming the North-Eastern Provincial Council. Elections were held once to this merged provincial council in 1988 and won by the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) led by Varatharajah Perumal who became its Chief Minister.
In 1990, Perumal chose to proclaim a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI). In response, then President Ranasinghe Premadasa dissolved the North Eastern Provincial Council and imposed direct rule from Colombo and this is how the region was administered for decades.
In 2006, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, which had campaigned for many years for a de-merger of the Northern and Eastern provinces, petitioned the Supreme Court which ruled in its favour, declaring that the decision taken by then President J.R. Jayewardene to merge the two provinces was null and void. The North Eastern Province was formally de-merged into the Eastern and Northern provinces on January 1, 2007.
Eastern Provincial Council
Subsequently, elections to the Eastern Provincial Council were held in May 2008 but polls could not be conducted in the North because of the war with the LTTE. Although the war ended in May 2009, it took the then government four more years to conduct elections in the North.
When polls were called, it was obvious that the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), a broad coalition of political parties including the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK), Peoples Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), Tamil Eelam Liberation Organisation (TELO) and EPRLF, would sweep the board. Hence, whoever was nominated as its chief ministerial candidate would become the Chief Minister.
Mavai Senathirajah, a veteran politician in the TNA who had spent his political life serving the region in various capacities and had been a parliamentarian since 1989 was the obvious choice. However, TNA leader R. Sampanthan prevailed on him to make way for C.V. Wigneswaran, a political neophyte but a much respected and recently retired judge of the Supreme Court, at the time. Sampanthan felt that Wigneswarans legal expertise would be of immense value for the NPC, in dealing with Colombo.
Canagasabapathy Visuvalingam Wigneswaran who was born in Colombo, in Hulftsdorp, the seat of all legal activity although his parents hailed from Manipay. Perhaps this was why he was called a southerner by his opponents during his election campaign.
As his father, a public officer, was transferred frequently Wigneswaran schooled in Kurunegala and Anuradhapura before attending Royal College, Colombo. Then he entered the Colombo University and the Law College. When he ended his academic career he had earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of London, a LLB from the University of Ceylon and passed his Proctors and Advocates exams at Law College.
The story has been told of how Vasudeva Nanayakkara, the President of the law Students Union in 1961, had to persuade a reluctant Wigneswaran to contest the union elections the following year. Wigneswaran did, and won. Decades later, Nanayakkaras daughter was to marry Wigneswarans son.
Out of law school, a promising career in law beckoned for Wigneswaran. He practised law for over fifteen years before deciding to take up a career as a judge. Joining the judicial service in 1979, he initially served as a magistrate and District Judge in Batticaloa, Chavakachcheri and Mallakam.
Justice Wigneswaran was appointed to the High Court in 1988 and served in the Northern, Eastern, North Central, Uva and Western provinces. He was appointed to the Court of Appeal in 1995. He was elevated to the Supreme Court in March 2001. Justice Wigneswaran retired in October 2004.
Chief Minister of Northern Province
Wigneswaran was one of the few retired judges who lent their voices against the impeachment of Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayaka. This was in keeping with the high profile he maintained after retirement, often commenting on social and political issues and earning regular headlines. He is fluent in Tamil, English and Sinhala.
The elections, as expected, returned a landslide win for the TNA which garnered 84 per cent of the vote. The TNA secured 30 of the 38 seats in the NPC. Wigneswaran was duly appointed the first Chief Minister of the Northern Province in September 2013.
The latest crisis in the NPC did not however occur overnight- trouble had been brewing within the TNA, especially after the Chief Minister acted unilaterally on a few occasions. The relationship between Wigneswaran and his party had been strained for some time because of this.
There appears to be ideological differences between Opposition Leader Sampanthan and the Chief Minister as well. Sampanthan, now 84 years of age, commands huge respect across the political spectrum. He belongs to an earlier generation of Tamil political leaders and many see him as the last among the moderates with whom Colombo could have a reasonable dialogue in addressing ethnic grievances.
Wigneswaran on the other hand is viewed as more hawkish, playing to gallery of Tamil nationalist sentiment from time to time. He has always been outspoken but his actions have been brash at times, not having the political nous required for the job, possibly because he lacks the experience of a career in politics.
The recent dispute evolved into a full scale crisis after Wigneswaran investigated four ministers of the NPC. Two ministers- Thambyrajaha Gurukularajah and Ponnuthurai Ayngaranesan- were found guilty while two were exonerated. Sampanthan wanted the two exonerated ministers, Provincial Health Minister P. Sathyalingam and Provincial Civil Transport and Fisheries Minister B. Denishwaran re-instated but Wigneswaran wanted a fresh probe into them and was insisting that they be suspended until the new inquiry was concluded.
Matters came to a head when the ITAK faction of the TNA moved to sponsor a motion of no-confidence against Wigneswaran. ITAK appeared to have mustered the support of 21 members of the 38-member NPC. Had the motion been approved at the NPC, Wigneswaran would have lost his position.
Significantly, the PLOTE, TELO and EPRLF factions of the TNA supported Wigneswaran in this political stand-off. Together, they command 14 seats in the NPC. These factions were accusing the TNA of colluding with opposition parties in the NPC to oust Wigneswaran because the ITAK by itself had only 15 seats in the Council.
Ultimately sanity prevailed and a compromise was reached. This followed hectic rounds of negotiations between TNA parliamentarians and even intervention from Hindu and Catholic religious leaders in the region.
No-confidence motion against Wigneswaran
It appears that Wigneswaran has blinked first because he has agreed to let the two ministers at the centre of the controversy to continue work until their second inquiry was completed. The ministers, in turn, have undertaken not to interfere with the probe. The ITAK has agreed to withdraw the motion of no-confidence against Wigneswaran.
This is indeed a welcome outcome not only for the TNA but for Colombo as well. That is because, had the TNA split into various factions, Colombo would have to deal with a multitude of political groups in the North in dealing with questions relating to the devolution of power- and that would be much more challenging than dealing with the single entity that is the TNA.
However, the big question is whether it could be said that alls well that ends well in the political theatre in the North. Many in the TNA now view Wigneswaran as the man who betrayed the trust placed in him by their leader, Sampanthan. Sampanthan did so, sacrificing Mavai Senathirajah in the process, a prospect Senathirajah then magnanimously accepted as he believed it would be in the best interests of the TNA. Now, both Sampanthan and Senathirajah- as well as many other TNA stalwarts- may well rue their decision.
It remains to be seen where the TNA will progress to, from here. It is hoped that Opposition Leader Sampanthan and Chief Minister Wigneswaran can let bygones be bygones and work together because their partnership will be crucial not only for the NPC but for the country as well, as the nation seeks to resolve a multitude of ethnic grievances, enact constitutional changes and facilitate reconciliation.

## Title: A look into the evolution of data centre storage
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Finance
## Date: Thursday, June 22, 2017 - 01:00
A look into the evolution of data centre storage
It has been over 60 years since IBM introduced the first disc, the IBM 350, which was the size of a large wardrobe, with a capacity for storage of 3.75MB.
Since then storage has evolved as more and more capacities were contained in smaller and smaller volumes.
In the present age, the typical IT infrastructure Head would explore the possibility of keeping at least the data which is less frequently accessed and less critical, hosted on the cloud.
Computer storage prices have dropped below US$ 0.10 per terabyte (TB), and it is simply not worthwhile to spend for the footprint, power and cooling for a category of data that can be stored elsewhere, and accessed on demand at a much less cost.
Evolution of network storage
By the 1990s, as enterprises needed to overcome the limitations presented with local storage, the concept of JBOD (just a bunch of discs) caught on where a disc array connected via a SCSI (small computer system interface) bus could be connected to a server, to provision storage.
Some models offered a split bus option, where two servers could share the storage with RAID (redundant array of independent discs) protection.
They offered better usage of storage resources comparatively and were restricted by the speeds imposed by the SCSI connectivity.
With the decline of prices in computer hardware over time, storage area networks which were considered as affordable only to the large-scale enterprises now became viable to be considered for the small and mid-range business enterprises.
As such we saw storage area network (SAN) based solutions being installed in state and private banks around 10 years back in Sri Lanka, with some of the then high performance Enterprise Class SAN systems being deployed at service providers like Sri Lanka Telecom.
Over the last decade or so we have seen SAN systems become a commodity. The product range varied, with high performance models with multiple controllers for large enterprises with heavy workloads and dual controller models for mid-range and small businesses.
The latter-day models for small businesses have become so user-friendly that they are designed to be rolled out by the customers themselves with minimum involvement from the manufacturer or systems Integrator.
Furthermore in the decade, the main pain points of the infrastructure chiefs have shifted from price of hardware to a different set. Decisions about the cost of the foot print in the data centre, cost of power and cooling, and efficient use of computers have started complimenting the large-scale integration that has been happening over the last so many decades in the field of semi-conductor electronics.
Storage today  the trends
Today we have network switches with very low latency and deep buffers that can guarantee lossless networks, which is a 'given' storage networking.
These trends in the networking field, complimented by the efficient use of compute power as availed via virtualization, have today brought to the forefront such technological trends as software defined storage aka, hyper-converged storages.
In one way the methodology of storage has taken the full circle as local storage is again being used.
But by today the software stack which operates on these discs have advanced over the last decade and half, where each compute node works in unison with each other to present a common storage layer.
The building blocks here are its local discs connected via a high performance network, ideally at a minimum of 10Gbps.
Entry-level solutions of this design have already been deployed in Union Assurance Life and Sci-com. The major hurdle that Sri Lankan businesses have at the moment is that their network infrastructure is slow to move forward from the 1GB limit, which is an essential element to guarantee an acceptable level of performance, to match the speeds of the FC-based, (now traditional) SAN, which operates at minimum of 8Gbps (the newer models support 16Gbps).
Future of storage and beyond
Yet, software defined storage is part of a small picture. The bigger picture is cloud-based services. The trend is for cloud-based collaboration services such as Googles G-Suite, Amazons AWS or Microsoft Azure where cloud-based application and collaboration applications could be used for a much lesser fee than if they were to be hosted inhouse.
This trend has already started in local banks and other mid-range businesses. This would allow businesses to deploy only their core applications from within. So while SaaS (or software as a service) is already catching up in the local business sector, IaaS (or infrastructure as a service) would probably be the future, as prices decline so that businesses can host their core applications, use HPC (high performance computing) and carry out Big Data Analytics using the hosted infrastructure.
This would release the business from the responsibility of managing a complex storage infrastructure which requires a skilled staff while meeting legal and compliance requirements too. More importantly, the business would not have to make the capital investment for storage and other compute resources. These trends in combination (SDS, SaaS, IaaS), have made the designers of storage solutions to revisit their road maps.
Flagship products by certain principles could very well be obsolete and the models retired in the years to come, as advanced software which is hardware agnostic, coupled with diminishing hardware prices (for example, solid state drives are fast becoming a commodity), offer more storage using simpler designs with the software layer delivering what hardware did a couple of years back.
Just In Time Group, a wholly Sri Lankan Company has been a key partner and implementer of several cutting edge mission critical ICT projects in the country over the last two decades. With the dawn of 2016, Just In Time Group completed a two decade (20 years) mammoth journey in the ICT arena of Sri Lanka.

Marking Fathers Day in Sri Lanka, UNICEF release new two-minute film paying tribute to the positive impact Sri Lankan fathers have on the healthy growth of their children.
Stars from the world of entertainment and sport including Sachin Tendulkar, David Beckham, the All Blacks, Novak Djokovic, Lewis Hamilton and Hugh Jackman have joined the United Nations Childrens Agencys (UNICEF) new Fathers Day campaign, toc elebrate fatherhood, and highlight the importance of love, play, protection and good nutrition for the healthy development of young childrens brains.
With Sri Lanka one of 90 countries celebrating Fathers Day on Sunday 18th June, the initiative invites families to post photos and videos of what it takes to be a super dad, using the hash tag #Early Moments Matter on their Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts. To inspire families across the world to share their super dad moments, photos and videos of UNICEF ambassadors and supporters who have got behind the campaign will be posted on UNICEFs Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and featured on the campaigns gallery.
To mark Fathers Day in Sri Lanka, and to pay tribute to the impact parents have on the healthy growth of their children, UNICEF has released a new two-minute film, in which Sri Lankan children aged between 5 and 11 years old, share their favorite memories about their fathers including their favorite games, meals or even a time when they have felt protected. At times comic, the heart-warming film closes with an important message, that you dont need super powers to be a super dad. Nutritious food, love, play and protection in the early years, shape childrens brain development for life. Watch the film on UNICEF Sri Lankas Facebook, Twitter or Youtube.
When I was a young child, my father gave me the right amount of love, freedom and support to shape who I am today, states UNICEF Ambassador Sachin Tendulkar in a press release. Every kid needs protection, love, good food and play to support growth and development, and its up to both parents to provide these.
I wouldnt be where I am today without the support of my dad, theres no question about that. He was involved right from the start and gave me all the love, guidance, decent food, and care that I could have wished for. Ill remain forever grateful to him for that, said UNICEF supporter Lewis Hamilton. I hope this initiative celebrates dads like mine across the world and helps those who are struggling get the support they need to be super dads too.
As a father, Ive seen for myself the impact that every smile, every bit of love, and every positive action has had on my child during these precious early years of life. Being a new parent isnt easy.
There are many challenges that fathers across the world face. This campaign is about supporting and encouraging fathers so they can be the Super Dads their kids desperately need, said UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Novak Djokovic.
Good parenting not only enables our children to develop to their full potential, but enables stronger social and economic development of Sri Lanka. Children who eat nutritious food and experience love, play and protection will not only be happy, they will grow and develop to their full mental, physical and emotional potential. This benefits not just themselves and their families, but Sri Lanka as a whole, supporting the nations drive for prosperity and stability. We want to celebrate the vital role of fathers in this, and encourage all parents to use the opportunity of a childs early years to lay the foundations of a happy and healthy future said UNICEF Sri Lanka Representative Tim Sutton.
Good parenting in early childhood, especially during the first 1,000 days, sparks neural connections in childrens brains, laying the foundation for their future successes. Research suggests that when children positively interact with their fathers, they have better psychological health, self-esteem and life-satisfaction in the long-term.
The Super Dads initiative forms part of UNICEFs #EarlyMomentsMatter campaign, which aims to drive increased understanding of how childrens environments and experiences in early childhood can shape their future health, well-being, ability to learn, and even how much they will earn as adults.

MERVYNS WAY
Eighteenth Death Anniversary today:
The Philosophy of Mervyn de Silvas Journalism:
Every journalist and most certainly every editor operates with a philosophy of journalism, whether they know it or notand most often they dont. A journalist who explicitly operates on the basis of a journalistic philosophy is rare. Rarer still is one who states it as such; one whose philosophy of journalism is easily traceable because it is in print. Mervyn de Silva was such a journalist.
Mervyns philosophy of journalism is easily accessible because of three landmark editorials in which he set it out. What is also noteworthy is that his philosophy of journalism did not remain static and instead evolved, developed in keeping with changing times and the change within the man himself. Finally, what is remarkable is that his philosophy of journalism stemmed quite transparently from a philosophy of life and existence, and that too was stated in print. This makes Mervyn not only an outstanding journalist but a thinker in journalism.
The iconic literary critic Regi Siriwardena, one of Mervyns two outstanding teachers of English at Royal College (the other being Dicky Attygalle), wrote the Foreword to the ICES publication In His Time: Selected Tributes to Mervyn de Silva 1929-1999. In it he chose to reproduce in full, the Daily News editorial of June 6th 1970, which was Mervyns first editorial having sat in the editorial chair at age 40. Regi noted that This one, unusually, bore the by-line Editor at the bottom, as if to emphasize that it was a personal declaration of the principles to which the new occupant of the chair was committing himself. The heading CREDO (a creed, a set of opinions or principles, as a good dictionary defines the word) seemed to underline that emphasis further.
Mervyns Credo commenced with the line The policy of this newspaper is based on the following principles and a representative paragraph read: Since the perils of an administrator insulated from public opinion should now be regarded as axiomatic, fair comment and responsible criticism should be viewed by any sensible administration as a function which subserves as much the communitys general interest as its own.
In the last paragraph of his Credo Mervyn admits that this declaration claims neither originality nor special sanctity. It is in fact founded on the commonplace canons of good journalism.
Having reproduced the Editorial in full, Regi confirms that in spite of the characteristic lucidity and trenchancy of Mervyns writing, the ideas he was stating were, as he acknowledged in his last paragraph, not new or original. They were in fact the accepted principles of independent and liberal journalism. Regi goes on to say that the text must be read in the context, and that context (notwithstanding the hagiography about departed Editors) was that during the campaign preceding the general election [of 1970] the Daily News and other Lake House newspapers had notto put it mildlydistinguished themselves by their fairness or non-partisanship.
Independent journalism
Regi Siriwardena concluded that Mervyns Credo still stands as an unfulfilled ideal of what a non-partisan Sri Lankan newspaper committed only to the public interest should be. However, Mervyns adherence to the liberal axioms of good, independent journalism were to undergo evolution, development and transformation. Regi set out the external factors: Before the decade was out, Mervyn had twice been deprived of his editorial chair, once by the management of Lake House, now state-owned, and once by the privately owned newspaper enterprise he joined thereafter. Both found him too independent, too little content to be the docile slave.
The two editorials that Mervyn wrote for the inaugural (May 1st 1978) and the first anniversary (May 1st 1979) editions of the Lanka Guardian reveal a dramatic shift in tone and perspective. The founding Editorial of the Lanka Guardian, the equivalent of his Credo in the Daily News of June 6th 1970, appeared significantly on May Day 1978 under the caption Other news, Another opinion.
The Lanka Guardian is primarily a journal of opinion. The proper functioning of a pluralist democracy pre-supposes the free interplay of diverse opinions. The freer and more active, the better.
Given the structure of the major media, the dominance of the official and the conventional view is no aberration. What is unnatural and therefore unhealthy, is the conspicuous absence of other opinions and perspectives which by calling into question or openly challenging the all-too easily accepted orthodoxies, stimulate intelligent discussion.
If we may dignify this exploratory venture in Sri Lankan journalism and embellish our ordinary wish with the formal ostentation of a motto, it is: OTHER news, and ANOTHER opinion.
In complete contrast to those English language journalists and editors who were supinely Anglo-American, Mervyns founding editorial for the Lanka Guardian clarified that This perspective is by no means confined to domestic issues and events. He registers protest at the reality of a poor nations essential condition of dependence, saying if the word means anything that is what Third Worldism is all about.
Philosophy of journalism
Mervyns international affairs perspective and his philosophy of journalism are inextricable, as demonstrated in that opening LG editorial: An informed interest in world affairs ought not to be a private occupation of the privilegentsia nor regarded as an irrelevance for the people...We believe that knowledge is the property that should be least private. The dissemination of informed opinion is a kind of sharing.
The next year, 1979, when the new UNP government was at the height of its hegemony, Mervyn would turn 50 and see Fidel Castro, though he had done neither when he wrote his first anniversary editorial for the Lanka Guardian. It was 20 years before his death.
In it he notes in passing and bemusedly, the criticisms made in Parliament by public figures (such as Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Deputy Foreign Minister), but as the Editorial moves on, the tone and topic change. In his concluding paragraphs he demonstrates that his commitment to pluralist democracy was rooted in a structural critique of the global establishment and a deep commitment to definitive change, and that this constituted a major facet of his philosophy of journalism. It was a second Credo: One important point remains to be cleared. It has been said that in our presentation of views, in our basic perspective, we are not balanced. It is the same argument that the transnational news agencies which control 90% of the international news flow use against fledgling Third World agencies. Be balanced, be neutral. On questions of social emancipation, neutrality itself could be a crime.
As for our own effort, we do not work in a vacuum. We must relate our work to the national information system, the reading public and to society at large. The communications system is heavily weighted in favour of established and Establishment opinion. However miniscule, ours is a corrective, the corrective of a countervailing force. (The First Year)
What were the values that informed Mervyns philosophy of journalism In a brilliant revaluation Godfrey Gunatilleke concluded that in the sustained 1972 debate in the Daily News with Mervyns old teacher Regi Siriwardena, Both Regi and Mervyn were agreed on what I would call the literary critical fundamentals. But it is Mervyn who comes out more convincingly on the issue of literature and ideology. And Mervyns definition of the issues and the answers he gives go beyond the boundaries of literary criticism.
Godfrey identifies Mervyns core values: This was the way Mervyn articulated his own rejection of relativist nihilism and defined the universality to which all societies and their cultures need to be linked.
Mervyns generation
What was that way Mervyns concluding line in the passage that Godfrey excerpts, reads:
The humanists article of faith embraces a human heritage. All literature is part of that... (Pound, Poetry and Politics, CDN, Friday Nov 17, 1972, p.4)
Universalist humanism, pluralist democracy, liberalismall values on a continuum, and the common stock of values shared by those of his generation and educational background. These demarcated Mervyn from the nativism and resentful nationalism that was manifest in society and had surfaced even within Mervyns generation. What made Mervyn distinct, though not unique, in his own generation and cultural stratum, was the
dual demarcation, from on the one hand, an anti-Westernism that turned its back on the universality that the western tradition contained and the English-educated elite had imbibed, and on the other, a West-centrism that ignored or benefited from the inequities of the interlocking domestic and global orders.
Mervyn was essentially part of the English-educated elite as Ajith Samaranayake wrote two days after his death in the
Daily News, but not of the pro-Western liberal
Establishment. He editorially defined his journalistic endeavors as a countervailing force and his commitment to pluralist democracy centered on the people.
Mervyn definitively elaborated his perspective in the 1982 paper Non-Alignment and the New Information Order, in the volume
The Principles of Non-Alignment, co-published by the International Progress Organization, Vienna, and the Third World Centre, London. The volume is No VII in the series Studies in International Relations edited by Hans Kochler, Chairman of the Philosophy Dept. at Innsbruck University, Austria:
an end to dominationthe ultimate goal of course in this projected path of progress is the total emancipation of our peoples and their liberation in all spherespolitical, economic and culturalthe system against which we are battling has been created by the West and remains WestdominatedDeeper down, as we touch the domestic power structure, we observe the role of local elites, their self-interest, their ideological outlook, and international linkagesa privileged English-educated minority stands at the apex of the power structure. In the countryside dwell the millions of Sinhala or Tamil educated poor, at whom the international communications system, controlled and managed by the metropolitan elite, is directed (Mervyn de Silva, The Principles of Non-Alignment, London, 1982, pp. 219-228)
Mervyn inscribed his core philosophical view in the final paragraph of the founding Editorial of the
Lanka Guardian, the journal that he launched, coincidentally, in the year his father died. The opening allusion is clear and the passage shows his evolution from the milieu of his childhood:
We have been advised to be lamps unto ourselves. The press in particular has been invited to light the path of our leaders. For common humanity the possibilities of personal salvation, so freely given to the artist and the saint, can only be enhanced by the larger endeavor of social emancipation. The act of informed discussion is itself a source of illumination. (Letter to the Reader: Other news, Another opinion,
Lanka Guardian, Vol.1, No 1, May 1, 1978.)
Aged 57, Mervyn made a further statement of his philosophy of journalism  and life-- in the message to
The Island on its 5th anniversary:
To be engaged and yet above the fray, to lead the reader quietly, and to trust the people, your ultimate judge and jury. (No island is an island,
The Island, Saturday, Oct 4th 1986)
Journalists responsibility
The captionNo island is an islandwith its derivation from Donne, expressed his settled conviction that Sri Lanka and Lankans must imperatively be internationalist, while the content of the message set out his stance (engaged and yet above the fray), his notion of the journalists responsibility (to lead the read quietly) and a firm unambiguous reiteration of his commitment--a commitment he commends to journalists and journalism itself -- to the people, your ultimate judge and jury.
Mervyn de Silva did not think that purely personal salvation was possible. He neither separated his philosophy from his journalism, nor thought that good, independent journalism was desirable or possible without a set of values and a perspective which went beyond both the personal and the purely professional. Social emancipation and liberation had become central categories. Mervyns independent liberal journalism had grown into an
emancipatory journalism, a
Journalism of Liberation. And yet, his abiding, almost Socratic commitment to informed, intelligent discussion as central to that project, placed him between liberalism and liberation, searching for a synthesis.

Moirs memorable moment
Moir students to participate in Worlds First International Robotics Olympiad:
With a mission to spread science and technology leadership around the world, FIRST Global is launching the world's first International Robotics Olympiad for high school students which will take place from July 16 to 18 in Washington D.C.
In Sri Lanka, with the collaboration of Tech Assured Holdings (Pvt), it was Elizabeth Moir Schools immediate and enthusiastic response in the midst of tight deadlines that led to their selection as the official team that will represent the country in the 2017 FIRST Global Challenge.
Ishini Gammanpila, Akash Gnanam, Ali Anver and Vinidu Jayasekera are the Moir students who will represent Sri Lanka at the event. The team members possesses an eclectic mix of talents and are a far cry from the stereotypical STEM geeks portrayed in mainstream media.
Gammanpila who has been building remote controlled boats with her father since she was eight was one of the leads in this years school play  Rumours. She is also a full scholar at the school who has excelled not only academically but also in swimming, singing and dancing. Gnanam is the schools Drama Club President, and is also a programming guru.
Anver is a big thinker. He believes that STEM related advances are accelerating at a speed that frankly scares him. But instead of shying away from these advances he wants to be part of it. Jayasekera is a master of coding and imagines herself in a job that allows her to pursue Artificial Intelligence.
More than 160 nations have registered to participate in the event, with each nation represented by one school robotics team. First Global will bring together high school students from all over the world to challenge these future STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Maths) leaders to think of STEM rooted solutions to global challenges. The inaugural challenge involves designing, constructing and programming a robot which will be able to differentiate between clean and dirty water and ultimately provide access to clean and potable water.
Team Sri Lankas travel expenses will be covered by Virtusa Corporation. Virtusa Corporation, Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Krishan A. Canekeratne and the first Head Boy of CIS appointed by Moir within months of her first coming to Sri Lanka in 1982, stated in a press release that they are honored and delighted to sponsor Team Sri Lanka in the international Robotics Olympiad.
 The enthusiasm, intellectual curiosity and highly-refined problem-solving skills these students bring to the world of robotics is truly inspirational.
These future technology leaders and STEM enthusiasts will be demonstrating thought leadership as it relates to the cleanliness of water on a world stage, setting an example to young and old alike, that together, we can find solutions to the problems that affect each and every one of us on the planet, he further stated.
For the students representing Sri Lanka in the first iteration of the FIRST Global Challenge, this experience is an opportunity to share their knowledge and accomplishments, and those of their country with the world.
This years event will not only provide an opportunity for students around the world to learn and discover more about the exciting world of robotics, but will also teach them the value of teamwork and the importance of gaining the trust of their peers, regardless of their place of origin, creed, religion or race.

Navin insists on need for Glyphosate for tea sector growth
Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said he will seek Cabinet approval to import the Glyphosate weedicide to be used in tea cultivation for a limited period once again.
Monsantos RoundUp Glyphosate was banned for sale and use by the government after a study found the weedicide is responsible for the increasing number of chronic kidney disease patients.
Addressing media at Sirikotha yesterday, Dissanayake said tea production has witnessed a decrease after the Glyphosate ban in 2015.According to him commercial agriculture,especially tea cultivation cannot be done without the use of Glyphosate.
A direct connectivity between the use of Glyphosate and chronic kidney disease has not been proved from research conducted by the World Health Organisation, the Minister noted.
The Minister said tea cultivation companies are calling him to lift the Glyphosate ban and he is seeking Cabinet approval to lift the ban for a few years.
As the Plantation Industries Minister I am concerned by the tea production decrease.The ban on Glyphosate should be lifted for at least five years until an organic weedicide is ready. But it should be imported only under strictly supervised conditions and regulations he said.
The Tea Research Institute is working on introducing an organic weedicide for tea cultivation by now.
A committee was appointed by the Prime Minister to study the issue and decide whether Glyphosate ban to be relaxed.

Parents of SAITM students call for justice
Letter to Prime Minister:
South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), Malabe, Medical Faculty students' parents in a letter to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has requested for justice for the MBBS graduates of SAITM.
Considering the Appeal Court order to give provisional registration of the Sri Lanka Medical Council to SAITM medical graduates, they have made a few proposals.
The parents association has proposed that the first three batches of SAITM MBBS graduates be considered separately from other SAITM medical students as the first batches had a fewer number of students (first batch  24 students, second batch  39 students and third batch  35 students) and had the opportunity of being trained by professors and other senior clinicians. Other batches which had more than 60 students should be given more clinical material, the association said.
The patient:student ratio was satisfactory at the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital in each section. The first batches were well trained. New technological methods used in developed countries had been used for training SAITM students.
The letter said special clinical training in neurology, oncology and orthopedics are conducted in reputed private hospitals under the guidance of senior consultants for SAITM medical students, while paediatric emergencies and neonatal care programmes were conducted at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children.
On a Supreme Court order, the first three batches were trained on rehabilitation of mental patients, medico-legal appointments in forensic medicine at Base Hospital, Avissawella and MOH office functions in the Kaduwela-MOH division, for which SAITM had paid Rs.150,000 per student to the Health Ministry.
At the end of each clinical appointment, a clinical assessment was done by external examiners from government medical faculties and senior consultants in government hospitals. The students were allowed to sit for the final MBBS examination in SAITM only after the completion of all clinical appointments. The final MBBS examinations in May and October of 2016 and 2017 March for the first three batches were conducted by external examiners from State medical faculties and senior consultants from government hospitals.
The SLMC visited SAITM in July 2015, though SAITM was given University Grants Commission (UGC) approval as a degree awarding institute in 2011 by a government gazette notification. According to the SLMC guideline booklet, the SLMC should have visited SAITM annually until the first batch of students had passed out. However, the SLMC did not visit SAITM from 2011 until 2015 when the total number of students was 894, which the SLMC took into account. This, the parents claim, was unfair for the first three batches of students who were trained with adequate clinical facilities.
In July 2015, when the SLMC committee visited SAITM, a professor from the committee had asked the students about holding the final MBBS examination to be conducted by the SLMC for which the students had agreed. Unfortunately, the SLMC had not followed it until May 2016.
The Parents' association had also requested the SLMC to conduct a standard final MBBS examination in 2015. A standard final examination was held according to UGC rules and regulations, with the involvement of external professors from state medical faculties and senior consultants, in May and October 2016 for the first and second batches.
The parents of the medical students request the authorities to attend to the matter and render justice to the students.

OMP has no power to hold criminal inquiries or file legal action: PM
The Office of Missing Persons (OMP) does not have any power to hold criminal inquiries or file legal action, as its role is limited to finding the truth on missing persons and issuing Certificates of Absence where necessary, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was moving the OMP (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) (Amendment) Bill for debate in Parliament yesterday. The OMP Act was passed in August last year amidst chaos in Parliament.
The Bill was to incorporate an Amendment proposed by JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Ratnayake to remove a clause that enabled the OMP to enter into agreements with any entity in executing its functions.
The Premier initiating the debate, stressed the need to look at healing the wounds of war and uniting as one nation, adding that the Government did not intend to hunt behind the past and engage in lengthy legal procedures on them.
We must put a closure to this and that closure is multi-faceted. It requires not only a Constitutional settlement and return of lands, but also addressing the issue of missing persons and taking remedial action, Wickremesinghe said.
He also said a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) similar to that of South Africa would be set up if necessary, adding that any development on this would be informed to the House. He said the Steering Committee involved in Constitutional reforms has to a large extent reached an agreement on the national question.
Questioned by MP Dinesh Gunawardena as to whether the President has endorsed the legislation and made the necessary appointments, the Prime Minister said the President would do so after the House duly passes the Amendments.
Uma Oya project a monster causing damage to property and people: Dy Minister Jayaratne
The Uma Oya Multi-purpose Development Project has started producing unexpected ill-effects, Parliament was told yesterday.
Deputy Environment and Mahaweli Minister Anuradha Jayaratne said that there was an internal leak that releases around 1,070 litres of water per second and admitted that there was a risk of houses and other buildings in Bandarawela town caving in.
The Minister was responding to a question by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, with regard to the imminent danger posed by this project.
When the foundation stone was laid for the Uma Oya Multi-purpose Development Project on April 29, 2008, various objectives and aims were listed to be achieved with the implementation of the project. However, now the project has turned out to be a monster causing immense environment destruction, property damage and inconvenience to thousands of people. As a result of the underground excavations meant for the construction of a tunnel, 4,625 houses had been damaged. Cracks have appeared in walls of houses, schools and religious places, MP Dissanayake said.
In the areas affected, wells, streams and canals had gone dry. It has been estimated that 2,333 natural streams have dried because of the tunnel project. Thousands of acres which had been cultivated, are now lying abandoned as the farmers lack water resources, he added.
MP Dissanayake demanded to know whether an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) had been carried out before the commence of the project and if so, whether the study predicted the consequences being experienced at present. He asked as to why the government did not declare the affected area as a high risk zone.
The Deputy Minister said that an EIA had been done by the University of Sri Jayewardenepura in 2011, but the damages and destructions being experienced now had not been foreseen by the report.
The government has already spent Rs 57 billion for this project and 77 percent of its work is complete. A reversal is not possible now, he added.
The President has appointed a new committee of experts to look into the first EIA report and the damages. We have been following the advices of the second committee to minimize the damages. In addition, the President had summoned the Ambassadors of Switzerland and Norway and sought their expert help from those countries. A team of engineers had arrived from Switzerland and are now working in the area in search of solutions. In the meantime, the government has taken action to pay compensation to the people affected, he said.
Govt has taken steps to safeguard Sri Lankans working in Qatar: FM
There is no immediate risk to the jobs of Sri Lankan expatriates in Qatar, Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake assured Parliament yesterday.
In a Ministerial statement Minister Karunanayake said the Government was closely monitoring the situation in the Gulf region and has taken steps for the safety of Sri Lankan nationals living Qater if any emergency situation arises.
He said about 150,000 Sri Lankan expatriates live in Qatar, while this number is 193,000 in Saudi Arabia, 125,000 in UAE and 18,000 in Bahrain.
Qatar authorities have assured that the situation in Qatar was very calm and stable. It is not reported that any Sri Lankan or any Sri Lankan business had been affected due to the prevailing situation in Qatar. The authorities have assured us of continued support and every Sri Lankan had been advised to contact the Sri Lankan Embassy in Qatar, if they require any assistance and advice on the current situation, he said.
However, in the case of any emergency situation which may arise, we have made arrangements for early repatriation of our nationals. Temporary travel documents will be issued and our Embassy in Qatar will take utmost care of all Sri Lankans there, he said.

Patients not receiving advantage of lense price reduction
The people are not receiving the benefit of the price reduction of lenses done through a special gazette notification.
An investigation has been initiated pertaining to this issue, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, prices of eye lenses imported to Sri Lanka by 38 companies had been reduced through the special gazette notification but it seems the profit is now distributed among doctors and companies.
"The patient only gets a price reduction of Rs. 2,000. But, this amount should be much higher than this. The prices of some eye lenses have been reduced from Rs. 26,900 to Rs. 17,000," he said.
The prices of eye lenses have been reduced from Rs. 25,900 to Rs. 16,400, Rs. 28,000 to Rs. 16,200, 25,900 to Rs. 15,500, Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 15,500 and Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 12,100 etc. The full price reduction list is available in the gazette notification, he added.

Legal action will be taken against the authorities if the government does not hold the Provincial Council Election on time, People's Action For Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL), Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said.
He was addressing the media at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute in Colombo.
Hettiarachchi said not holding the Provincial Council Election on time violates the Constitution.
He said the only way the government can postpone holding the Provincial Council Election is by holding a referendum. Politicians should adhere to standards, he said.
Hettiarachchi said political leaders should hold elections. People should be vigilant whether Parliamentarians fulfill their needs. Not holding elections is a more serious offence than holding elections as sections, he said.
The cut off percentage of votes for minor political parties should be reduced to two percent from the five percent of the total number of votes to ensure that they receive representation in Local Government bodies, he said.

Purchase of condos by expats sees exponential growth - Blue Ocean
The construction and real estate industry has been a major contributor to Sri Lankas rapid economic development over the past few years, says Blue Ocean Chairman S. Thumilan.
Blue Ocean Group of Companies has become the market leader in the construction of condominiums developing over 1,100 units spanning 10 cities in Colombo and the suburbs, he said.
The country has rushed to make up for its more than two-and-a-half decades of intermittent building activity across most segments, from high-end residential housing to commercial and office space to a variety of key infrastructure segments.
The world has now shown a keen interest in Sri Lanka, thanks to its ongoing socioeconomic stability and rapid economic growth.
Global investors see afresh the opportunities that they can have by investing in Sri Lanka, which lies very close to one of the most sought after international sea trade routes.
Thumilan said his firm was aware that many without knowledge or previous exposure in the industry have predicted a drop in demand, by claiming that the market has reached a point of saturation. This could not be further from the actual situation, as they were quite confident about the behavioural aspects of the luxury housing market.
Many Sri Lankan nationals who left the country previously during the civil war and lived overseas until now in Europe, Australia, Canada and USA have begun returning to their country of birth seeking an abode for retirement which also will provide them with a sense of belonging and the opportunity to be amongst family and friends, he said.
Further, Sri Lankas conducive climate in comparison to the countries mentioned above and the religious cultural traditions make them eager to return.
As a result, vast numbers of expats are looking to buy apartments for both investment and accommodation purposes. Since of late, purchase of condominiums in Sri Lanka by high net-worth expats has seen an exponential growth, Thumilan says.
Earlier this year, a research conducted amongst the high net-worth families in China found out that more than 60% of the rich families have already immigrated to another country or were considering the prospects of immigrating. This has also become a growing trend in the oil-rich Middle East and North African (MENA) economies.
Accurate research by those who intend to purchase property here would indicate that the prices of apartment buildings in our country continue to be attractive in comparison to other property prices in Europe, Hong Kong or even China.
The governments commendable decision to grant a temporary residence visa for a period of two years (extendable on expiry), under the Dream Home policy has encouraged many retired expatriates who are looking to migrate to warmer countries, to consider investing towards purchasing property in our country. Similar visa facilities and schemes have helped countries such as Malaysia and Dubai to successfully attract pensioners and retirees, Thumilan said.
Blue Ocean Group also possesses the experience, technical expertise, manpower and financial strength to carry out any type of small, large or massive construction projects that the government and private sector envisage in their journey towards the development of Sri Lanka, Thumilan said.
To ensure the sustainability of the social and environmental aspects associated with our business, we continue to embrace best practices for social and environmental management, he said.
"From a social perspective, our infrastructure projects across the country have a significant bearing on the communities in the area and has improved the standard of living of our stakeholders."
Our work to empower these communities has made Blue Ocean Group a brand name and an exemplary corporate citizen of Sri Lanka, Thumilan said.

Regaining of GSP Plus concession, a victory for Govt: SB
The credit for regaining GSP Plus tax concession must go to the present Government including President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The country lost the GSP Plus concessions due to the wrong doings of the previous regime, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
He was speaking at a media briefing at the Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Ministry Auditorium yesterday.
The Minister said that over 1,000 apparel factories had been closed down due to the loss of the GSP Plus tax concession but regaining of the facility would help uplift the apparel industry. This would allow the country compete with nations such as Vietnam and Bangladesh.
Sri Lanka will be under the supervision of the European Union (EU) with the regain of the tax concession, to ensure that the country follows the agreed terms and conditions,Dissanayake said.
He also said that Sri Lanka was granted the GSP Plus tax concession under special circumstances even when the concession is not provided to lower middle income economies such as Sri Lanka.
The Minister further pointed out that the main reasons for the loss of the preferential trade scheme were the accusations levelled against the former Government by journalists together with war crimes allegations.
