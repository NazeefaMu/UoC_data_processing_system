Fair prices for essentials - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday, said the government has taken measures to introduce fair price shops in collaboration with the private sector and the Lak Sathosa to ensure fair prices for essential commodities in the open market.
The Prime Minister while noting that the prices of commodities have seen an increase, said that agriculture production was hampered due to bad weather conditions that swept across the country during the past two years.
The prices of commodities have seen a drastic increase and as a government, we are aware of it, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister was speaking after opening the Gampaha Bus Stand-2. The new bus stand is a free Wifi Zone. The bus stand was constructed by the Urban Development Authority utilizing funds from the Sukitha Purawara Town Development Programme of the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry under the directions of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The Premier said that adverse weather conditions had affected agriculture production in the country during the past two years and this situation has resulted in the increase in the cost of living.
The Prime Minister added that the government will find a permanent solution to this issue.
However, the government has taken measures to introduce fair price shops during the festive season until next April, with the participation of the private sector and the Sathosa.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added that following discussions between President Maithripala Sirisena, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera,
private sector representatives, Sathosa, public sector officials and himself, it was decided to provide essential items at Landed Price rates until April next year.
The prices of Rice, Dhal, Sugar, Sprats, B Onions, Potatoes and long beans would be provided at landed prices, the Premier said.
Cargills Food City, Laugfs, Richard Pieris and Company, John Keells Ltd. and Wickramaratne (Private) Ltd and Lanka Sathosa that participated the discussion agreed to provide this facility.
The Government cannot address this issue alone.Therefore,the support of the private sector is needed to address this issue,the Premier said.
The Premier further said that those private sector organisations and Sathosa could cater only to 30 percent of the requirement. He added that these organisations have agreed to provided transport to deliver essential items to the villages and the rest 70 percent of the consumers at landed price rates. However, it would take another fortnight for these commodities reach the villages.
He also said that if the prices of consumer items dont see a reduction after taking these measures, the government would take steps to import them.
The Gampaha District would be developed along with the area between Colombo and Gampaha in another 10 to 15 years, the Prime Minister added.
He said further that the area extending to Mahara,Kadawatha, Yakkala, Ja-ela and Udugampola would be developed within this period making Gampaha one of the biggest cities in the country.
The Prime Minister further said that Gampaha was declared a new district in 1978 during the J.R.Jayewardene regime.
The fisheries and tourism industries in the Negombo area were promoted while Gampaha was developed as the administrative centre in the district.
The Premier added that the district and its surrounding areas would be developed under the guidance of the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry.
This ministry has had to find funds for its projects and also funds to settle the loans taken during the previous regime, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
However, the government is solving the peoples issues,the Prime Minister added.
UNP Gampaha District Parliamentarian Ajith Mannapperuma said the rail track from Ragama to Veyangoda via Gampaha should be developed to three lanes as thousands of commuters travel by train between 6 am to 8 am everyday.

Five great players who are poor role models
Despite rival sports having plenty of problems with their own athletes  performance-enhancing drugs, for instance  its common for fans of them to sling mud at footballers, stating that the players are bad role models in comparison to athletes from other sports.
Unfortunately, for a lot of the time, theyre right. For every player like Cristiano Ronaldo  who treats his body like a temple  and Juan Mata  who is renowned for his philanthropy off the pitch  there are others who like nothing more than to abuse their bodies off the pitch and abuse the officials and opposing players when theyre on it.
Here are five players who are poor role models for any fans watching.
1. WAYNE ROONEY
The highest-profile British player of the past decade, Wayne Rooney has often found himself embroiled in controversy, both on and off the pitch, and while a lot of the time he comes across like a down-to-earth family man, there are other incidents that leave you scratching your head and questioning his position as a role model.
On the pitch, Rooneys career has largely been blemish-free in comparison to some of his peers, but hes still been involved in more than one unsavoury situation. Hes been sent off twice while representing England and while you can almost excuse his red card in the 2006 World Cup against Portugal; his second  brandished for an incident that saw him lash out at a Montenegrin player for no good reason  was ridiculous and saw him banned for the first two games of Euro 2012.
Then there are the issues surrounding his language  the 2010 World Cup saw him captured barking insults into a TV camera at his own fans following a poor performance from England that saw them boo, and then there was the infamous incident in the 2010/11 season that saw him fined for swearing into a TV camera following a goal against West Ham  his 100th in the Premier League for Manchester United.
As for his off-pitch behaviour, where do you start There are the allegations that he had prostitutes, dating back to his early days at Everton and also in 2010 after he was married with children, and more recently hes had alcohol issues, photographed in 2016 with wine-stained lips while on duty with England and then charged with drink-driving earlier this year. He mightve been an incredibly talented player at his peak, but Wayne Rooney has never been a great role model off the pitch.
2. LUIS SUAREZ
Despite being one of the most talented players in the world for the past decade, Luis Suarez is also one of the most controversial, and his on-field behaviour means that nobody could ever see the Uruguayan international as a decent role model.
Even the tournament that saw him rise to prominence  the 2010 World Cup  saw him embroil himself in controversy, as he handled the ball in the Quarter-Finals against Ghana to prevent a goal. He was sent off, but Uruguay went through on penalties, causing him to celebrate like hed won an Olympic gold medal. From there Suarez simply went from one controversy to another.
An incident while playing for Ajax in late 2010 saw him bite an opposing player  he was fined and suspended by his club, and the Dutch KNVB suspended him for seven games. During the suspension a transfer to Liverpool was agreed, and while he was brilliant on the pitch for the Reds, his two biggest controversies came during his time at Anfield.
First, there was an unsavoury incident during the 2011/12 season that saw him charged with racially abusing Patrice Evra of Manchester United, apparently using a racial slur on numerous occasions during the game. Suarez was slapped with an eight-match ban, but Liverpool stood by their man, only for him to drop them in hot water again when he bit Chelseas Branislav Ivanovic and was hit with another lengthy ban  this time ten games.
2013/14 saw Suarez keep his nose clean for Liverpool, but during that summers World Cup he disgraced himself again, biting an opposing player for the third time  this time Italys Giorgio Chiellini. Suarez was banned by FIFA for four months for the infraction, and during his time away he engineered a move from Liverpool to Barcelona. Hes been largely clean during his time at the Nou Camp, but with a man of his reputation, its surely only a matter of time before he muddies himself again. Hes simply a terrible role model despite his talent.
3. JACK WILSHERE
Outside of a sending-off for Arsenals youth side earlier in this season, the on-field behaviour of Jack Wilshere has largely been fine. Off the pitch, however, Wilshere has proven time after time that hes a poor role model as hes behaved like a poster-boy for all of the bad stereotypes about footballers when it comes to drinking, smoking and acting more like a rock star than a professional athlete.
One of the most common criticisms of footballers in the modern era is that they receive too much money and fame at too young of an age, and Wilshere certainly fits that bill  he broke into the first team at Arsenal back in 2008 as a 16-year old, and his prodigious talents saw many observers label him as the future of English football; his passing and dribbling abilities in the creative midfield position saw him compared to Paul Gascoigne, even.
But hes had a myriad of fitness issues that have seen him struggle to live up to his potential, and many of them could be linked to his off-field behaviour. Weve seen Wilshere in hot water more times than can be counted for drinking and smoking off the field, and hes even been in trouble with the law as well.
The summer of 2010 saw him arrested for his part in a post-nightclub fracas, and in 2011 he received a police warning for spitting at a taxi driver wearing a Tottenham hat. And in Arsenals 2015 FA Cup winning celebration parade, he got on the mic to sing obscene anti-Spurs songs.
In a nutshell, hes a fantastically talented player on the pitch whos also a poor role model off it, and his off-pitch lifestyle may well have affected his physical abilities, too. Perhaps those Gascoigne comparisons were fair ones indeed.
4. DIEGO COSTA
In defence of Diego Costa, we know very little of his lifestyle off the pitch. Unlike the afore-mentioned Wilshere and Rooney, he isnt renowned for behaving more like a rock star when he isnt playing, and in fact, his Wikipedia page doesnt even have a Personal Life tab. That isnt a bad thing. But on the pitch, the Brazilian-born Spanish striker is the master of footballs dark arts, loving nothing more than a confrontation  whether thats with opposing players, the officials, or even his own teammates or coaches.
A physically-imposing player on the pitch, Costa is known for a tough-tackling, hard-hitting style, but realistically theres nothing wrong with that  unless youre an opposing defender.
But hes also well-known for haranguing officials  one of the most unsavoury sides of the modern game and something that turns a lot of observers away from the game  and has been embroiled in plenty of controversy for diving and stimulating, too.
Hes also an apparently poor sportsman  he was criticised in 2014 for taunting Evertons Seamus Coleman after the defender scored an own goal, and in January 2015 he found himself suspended for three games following a pair of stamping incidents against Liverpool  incidents that the majority of observers thought couldve easily been avoided.
Throw in the fact that in 2016, he attempted to arrange a move away from Chelsea to the Chinese Super League for seemingly greed-related reasons  only to fall out with boss Antonio Conte and find himself shipped back to Atletico Madrid instead  and hes just not a good role model even if hes largely a non-entity off the pitch.
5. FRANCK RIBERY
Recognised by fans and pundits alike as one of the most talented attacking players of the past couple of decades, French international Franck Ribery has had a relatively quiet career on the field when it comes to controversy, rarely embroiled in the sort of unsavoury incidents that have marred the careers of the afore-mentioned Luis Suarez or Diego Costa. But off the pitch is a whole other story.
The warning signs may well have been there from an early age  a youth player at French club Lille, he was released not for his on-pitch skills, but for his behavioural issues off the pitch. Undoubtedly, the low point for Ribery was the 2009/10 season. In April 2010 it was reported by a French television station that four French internationals were being investigated for their roles as clients to a major Parisian prostitution ring, one that was also being accused of using underage girls as prostitutes.
It eventually emerged that Ribery  supposedly happily married with children  was involved in a relationship with a prostitute who was just 16 at the time, although Ribery denied knowing her age. Quite why he was involved in the first place was a mystery though, of course.
Despite that disgusting incident hanging over him, Ribery still went to the 2010 World Cup with France  where he further muddied his reputation by supposedly freezing out fellow midfielder Yoann Gourcuff and falling out with coach Raymond Domenech.
France crashed out during the group stage after three terrible performances, and Ribery ended up suspended by the French FA for three games for his questionable behaviour.
He retired from international football in 2014 for personal reasons and despite his talents, I dont think many French fans wouldve minded  after all, for his off-field behaviour hes a terrible role model. - SK

Former Navy Spokespersons daughter calls for his release
Manjari Dassanayake, the daughter of former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake, said that her father should immediately be released from custody.
Speaking outside a meeting of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on Friday, she said the visiting working group had declined a request to visit her father at the Prison Hospital where he is being held.
(Hes also an) arbitrary detainee, and these special delegates came to Sri Lanka to investigate arbitrary detainees  and they interviewed all LTTE people, but not war heroes, she said.
Commodore Dassanayake and five others were arrested in July on the charge of aiding and abetting the abduction and disappearance of 11 Tamil youths in 2008 and 2009.
He has been held in legal custody since July, and Magistrate judges have repeatedly denied his requests for bail, citing the seriousness of the allegations. Without any credible evidence against him hes been kept in remand for 6 months, and the CID has not been prepared to consent for bail being granted to my father, Manjari Dassanayake said. Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne ordered that Dassanayake be transferred from the Welisara Navy Hospital to the Prison Hospital last month, saying the Navy hospital could not be considered a public hospital under the Prisons Act.
Commodore Dassanayake has made an application requesting his case be transferred to a higher jurisdiction.

Asia Rugby U19s Championship 2017 - Second Leg:
Hong Kong go out firm favourites against hapless Sri Lanka
The Hong Kong Under 19s mens national team will go out firm favourites to win the Asia Rugby Under 19s title when they take on hapless Sri Lanka under 19 rugby team in the second leg at home in Hong Kong Football Club rugby stadium today. As per the new format introduced this year it will be Hong Kong versus the hosts on a home-and-away series with last years runners-up Sri Lanka.
Hong Kong travelled to Colombo for the opening match last Sunday thrashing the host Sri Lanka by runaway 37 points to 8 at Race Course international stadium in Sri Lanka in the end. A series win in this will see Hong Kong qualify for another Under 20 Rugby world cup trophy tournament in 2018.
The squad under head coach Stephen Dows features ten members from last years winning team including the veteran Mark Coebergh, who has featured in all four of Hong Kongs previous Asia Rugby Under 20 rugby title wins.
Coebergh will be joined by cracking number eight Max Denmark, who had his senior debuts in both sevens and fifteens under the Hong Kong jersey. The two players Coebergh and Denmark had co-captain the Hong Kong rugby squad in Sri Lanka.
These two seniors Coebergh and Denmark are supported by a number of fellow Under 20 veterans including winger Marcus Ramage, who will be joined by his brother Gregor who is a third row forward.
They will be further strengthened with the services of players from the last years competition which include Jake Barlow, Mikkel Christensen, Oliver Duffy, Liam Herbert, Takamasa Hoshiyama, James Karton, Oliver Overman, Sam Tsoi, Jack Abbott, Thaddeus Summers, Kelvin Chau, David Tang, Chong Shun-Hong and Paul Altier. Mean while the Sri Lankan team led by their speedy wing three quarter Naveen Heenakankanamge played a somewhat of a unimpressive game against Hong Kong in their first leg game played last week , The forte of the Sri Lankan side have been their power-packed forwards and they should come up with an improved display with the whole team must rally around their skipper enabling them to come up with a much better performance and should give of their very best if they hope to overcome this sensational Hong Kong outfit.

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP
Last first round game for Kandy today
Defending champions and table leaders Kandy Sports Club will travel down to Havelock Park today to play their last first round game under lights against number two team of the league Havelock S. C. Kandy S C having beaten all the clubs they met this season, will be looking to repeat that success. The hill country club has opted to name, the squad, what looks like their strongest possible XV for this game. It is Kandy SCs attacking style of play that helps them to drive their ability to demolish opponents. Up to now in six games they have scored all in all 36 tries. This side has been blessed with some of the countrys best rugby brains, including coaches. If Havelock SC are to do well in their home den, they will have to perform to the best of their ability and more importantly offensively - if they are to be contenders this year. They also need to have more variety in their game.
Kandy rugby academy 10s
The 10-side rugby tournament organized by the Kandy Rugby Academy was held last Saturday 9 and Sunday 10 at the Bogambara Stadium, which saw two good days of rugby. Nearly 800 young ruggerites from rugby academies and schools around the country were seen in action. The results: Under 16 - (Cup) champions - Rugby Promotional Foundation, runner up  HARFA, (Plate) champions - Panadura rugby academy, Runner up - Kandy rugby academy. Under 18 (Cup) champions - Kandy rugby academy, Runner up - CIS Colombo, Under 21 (Cup) champions - ICBT Kandy, Runner up - Rugby Promotional Foundation, Open cup champions - Army Archers A, Runner up  HARFA. Open Plate champions - Army Archers B. Runner up - Guardians Sports Club.
U-14 Boys & Girls hockey nationals
The All island under 14 boys and girls fourteenth hockey nationals took place at the Asgiriya Stadium from 8 to 10. It was a tense three day tournament, which kept the spectators glued to their seats as all the participants enjoyed watching good games. Thanks to all the boys and girls participants and a big hand to the coaches who had guided the young and budding players from different schools of our country to show their mettle. This was a major step ahead to improve hockey but sad to say the organizing part was not up to standard, facilities for the players at the venue was limited even the match results were not available. Maris Stella College Negombo and Seethadevi Balika Vidyalaya Kandy won the Gold star.
Panda to lead Wariyapola Sri Sumangala
Wariyapola Sri Sumangala College earlier known as (St. Pauls) College will be led by fly half Panda Wanigasekara, a good player and has a good set of players behind him. Veteran soldier B.B.N. Dharmapala will be the coach. They first played rugger when they were known as St. Pauls College and produced some good players. It is a school which gives a big hand for rugby. Like other schools, they get a lot of support from their Old Boys Rugby wing.
Dharshana to head Scrummage again
Dharshana Munasinghe one of the top wing three quarters who sported the Trinity College jersey in the early 1990s is tipped to head the Old Trinitians Rugby Scrummage for another term. Last time he took over from another top ruggerite Rohan Abeyakoon. The AGM is expected to be held on December 18. Among the others who were elected last time were famous ruggerite, basketball player, bodybuilder, actor and Mr. Sri Lanka 99 in modeling Duminda de Silva and Tyronne Smith another top sportsman and a good promoter. Ryde Gold medalist Asanka Ranhotty was elected secretary. Old Trinitians Rugby Scrummage (OTRS) is an organization affiliated to the Old Boys Association of Trinity College, the scrummage was formed in mid-1990 to support the game in the school. Some of the founders of this scrummage are Kenneth Boteju, Raja Addihetti and Udeni Mollegoda. Thanks to the efforts of these great rugby lovers, today this committee is moving well.
Good news for club hockey
A herculean effort is being made to revive club hockey in Kandy to its former glory days. It is sad to note that hockey has taken a back seat at club level. Some of the veteran players have decided to give a hand, whatever said and done school hockey both boys and girls are at top level. Kandys hockey has a long history, it was P.T. Rajan who revived hockey in Kandy in the late 1930s and introduced it to the schools and clubs.
Premier league cricket no clubs from Kandy
Sri Lanka premier league inter club cricket tournament started last Saturday with 14 teams divided into two groups, sad to say there are no clubs from Kandy in the tournament. That is club cricket in Kandy today, with over ten schools playing the game.
Kandy needs a well-equipped ground
Kandy could reign in sports only if another well-equipped ground is provided. Sports is so popular in Kandy and developing fast that today there is an urgent need for another playground, especially for sports like cricket and hockey at school level. These two sports which are doing well at school level, lack ground facilities. Rugby at school level is alright they get sponsors and pay a big amount for ground fee. Cricket and hockey are not in the same boat. A few days back, the under 14 hockey nationals was held and it was mess, there were many team buses from outstations with no place to park. They had to park their buses in the Mahiyawa cemetery and it was sad to see school boys and girls walking from Asgiriya grounds to the cemetary even to have their meals. The Bogambara Stadium was an asset for sports activities earlier when it was under the KMC. But today most of the sports are finding it difficult due to high ground fees and separate payments for marking lines using the pavilion, referees change room etc.
YMCA back with chess
Kandy YMCA, which gives a big hand for Iron sports and Basketball at one time promoted chess in a big way. After a long spell they have qualified for the Chess Super League 2018 with the qualifying tournament held last week where only eight top chess clubs qualified for the super league. A big hand should go to Ishan Wiratunga and the YMCA board members. Ishan was an active chess player in the 1980s and 1990s. However, after a lapse of nearly 15 years Kandy YMCA is getting back to the main stream of chess in the island. In 1994/95 under Vasantha Wethasinghe they won the inter club championship. This time the team led by Bahaya Yaparatne, a product of Vidyartha College became number two in the B section and have qualified for the super league which will commence in the coming month.
Antonian girls in Malaysia
St. Anthonys Covent, hockey under the guidance of former Sylvestrian G.G. Dharmaratne have been at the best, and won many trophies. According to the coach this year they have won three All Island tournaments. Hockey is the game which has given an identity to the school in sports. Two teams under 19 and 15 left on Wednesday to Malaysia for the 44th Pesta Hoki USM-Penang International Seven a side tournament which began on December 15 and will conclude on 17 at University Saints Penang grounds. The Under 19 team: Sandunika Devagiri ( C) , Sanduni Peries (V/C), Dilkshi Perera, Kaveesha Gajanayake , Kumudika Pelpola, Anjani Wickremaratne, Swetham Wickramanayake, Hansani and Ellawella.

Dananjaya does well in cross-country race
Sri Rahula Colleges M. Dananjaya Alwis clocked 16.24m in the Central Province Schools boys 5 km. road race, to emerge the winner. Dilantha Mahagedera of Poramadulla Central was second and N. Sanjaya Bandara third.
Athula wins gold in powerlifting
Athula Wijawickrema won a gold with an Asian powerlifting record in the Masters one category meet of the Asian Powerlifting championship held in Kerala. His total was 637.5 kg, squat 265 kg which was an Asian record, and his dead lift was 235 kg and the bench press 137.5 kg. Athula also won a silver medal in Mr. Squat event at the Commonwealth power lifting championship held early this year in South Africa.

1946 Antonian captain Hugh no more
The 1946 St. Anthonys College cricket captain Hugh G Fernando died on Wednesday 7 at the age of 92 and his funeral took place on Friday, December 8 at the Mahiyawa General Cemetery. He was a fine cricketer during his days, Some of his team mates at school were M. Zarook, L.C Fernando and L. Pamunuwa. The following year he crossed over to St. Peters College and played for the Bambalapitiya School. He was one of the few players who did well with both bat and ball. The year he led St Anthonys the big match with Trinity College ended in a draw. Hugh was a keen sportsman, worked as a planter and also played cricket for Up-Country clubs before his retirement. He was the husband of Tulia and father of Rodney, Rohan, Yasmine and late Trevor.

Military to be trained in search and rescue
The Asia Pacific Alliance for Disaster Management (A-PAD) has forged a partnership with the Sri Lanka military, especially the Air Force (SLAF) in conducting a professional training with international experts in an effort to formalize the approaches taken in search and rescue for volunteers and the military.
The Disaster Management Centre provided assistance and coordination related to the training. The SLAF disposed of its ground and air assets to train the first-ever civil-military coordinated exercise under the leadership of the Commander of the Air Force. A-PAD SL with other volunteer groups coordinated the training programme at the SLAF Station in Koggala.
Urban flooding too poses a severe threat which requires better professionalism and the identification of appropriate search and rescue equipment for lifesaving operations. While the military has its search and rescue capacity; enhancing their knowledge via training to achieve international standards in S&R, will provide an opportunity to save more lives by promoting efficiency, enhance quality and coordination.
This will also enable these teams to be deployed in the region to support other countries. Due to these reasons, the need to train volunteers and the SL Forces to further enhance capacity in Search and Rescue operations is vital, stated A-PAD in a media release.
Through the expertise of four A-PAD international trainers from Japan, the training programme was conducted for the Sri Lankan Forces and volunteers from November 19 to 21, 2017. The objective of the training was to introduce and practice disaster response methodologies for sudden-onset disaster aligned with internationally accepted International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) guidelines in the process of preparedness, cooperation and coordination.
The training programme consisted of a Preparation Phase to familiarize participants with internationally agreed upon deployment and coordination procedures, based on INSARAG Guidelines. The Operational Phase incorporated a two-and-a-half-day training and simulation exercise where the participant groups were confronted with an initial situation where only limited information is provided and tasks which the role players should complete are injected by exercise controllers through various channels such as field assessment, technology, media reports etc.
Civil-military coordinated flood rescue simulation exercise was carried out following competency of individual and collective skills. Ground and air rescue simulation exercises provided live experience for participants and also identified limitations.
The combined resource strength between civil and military in saving lives was evident following the training.
Whilst the current training was limited to flood rescue, training in all disciplines will be conducted systematically. Civil Military cooperation will be further strengthened to create better humanitarian responses with professional training and appropriate equipment.

Minister denies allegations regarding Private Secretary
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera in a media release yesterday strongly denied allegations that the Ministers Private Secretary, Ruwan Ferdinandez has been removed from his post.
He stated that Ferdinandez had acquired prior approval a few months ago to undertake a foreign trip and was scheduled to return to the country next week. Thereafter, he would promptly report to work, explained the minister.
Minister Samaraweera further observed that he had no desire nor was he in the habit of removing officers who have served him in his political work, loyally over a number of years based on unfounded allegations spouted by certain websites.
Websites have also reported that Minister Samaraweera had asked the CID to investigate into his private secretary in his alleged involvement in the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda. They alleged that this was after Ferdinandez wrote a letter to the minister asking for an investigation to clear his name.
Ferdinandezs name was brought into the limelight after the website lankaenews.com reported that he was involved in the disappearance of Ekneligoda.

Minister instructs CEB to resolve issue
Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has instructed the Ceylon Electricity Board management to take a decision with regards to the issues raised by CEB trade unions presently engaged in a fast, media spokesman for the ministry Sulakshana Jayawardena said.
According to Jayawardena, these instructions were given by the minister at a meeting held last Thursday (14) with the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Secretary and the CEB Chairman.
The CEB board is to hold a meeting take a decision on the issue next Monday, Jayawardena also said.
Speaking further on the matter, Jayawardena said the main concern raised by the trade unions is over their bonus allowances. There have been several trade union actions taken by the CEB trade unions this year. The most recent one took place in September and the CEB has already agreed to consider these days as paid leave. However, the same unions had engaged in trade union actions in April 8 and June 28 in 2017. These two days are considered leave without pay. According to the CEB circular, a 10% of the yearend bonus will be deducted for these LWOPs, Jayawardena explained.
However, it is in the hands of the CEB management to bring this matter to a conclusion, Jayawardena pointed out.

Moves to protect Udawalawa reservoir dam
Attention has been drawn on taking precautionary measures to protect the Udawalawa reservoir dam before it posed a threat.
It was reported that the Udawalawa reservoir dam is in a dilapidated condition. This was discussed during a meeting organised by the Deputy Directors office on Thursday.
At the discussion chaired by Deputy Director Sujeewa Gunasekara, it has been decided to take prompt action to protect the dam. At the discussion, Gunasekara pointed out that the dam is being damaged gradually since the dam is used for vehicle transportation as a part of the main road. Heavy vehicles are travelling on the road and sometimes, vehicles parked on the dam.
He added that six columns of the main sluice gate are cracked.
As a remedy, measures are taken to reduce the speed of vehicles travelling on the dam and vehicles are not allowed to park on the dam for any reason. Notice boards will be set up to make the public aware of the precautionary measures. Also, moves will be taken to close the unauthorised road running between the main dam and the reservation.

No contract, Gota can't pay back - AG
The Attorney General yesterday informed the Court of Appeal that there has been no written or oral contracts entered into by the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation and the D.A. Rajapaksa Foundation for the construction of the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appearing on behalf of the Attorney General said the then Navy Commander had given a statement stating that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa by a telephone call requested him to release Navy personnel to provide labour.
There is no contract in writing. There is not even a verbal contract. Therefore, there is no undertaking to pay back the funds, Dayaratne said.
The Senior Deputy Solicitor General requested to vacate the Interim Order challenging the maintainability of the of the writ petition. He said former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was challenging a document which had been filed two years ago. The certificate issued by an ASP in terms of Public Property Act has been filed two years ago (2015). The undue delay is a ground to refuse this application. This is an application,the court should not entertain due to the delay. There has been no violation of law either on the part of the Attorney General or FCID, he further added.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General further said that the D.A.Rajapaksa Foundation voluntarily agreed to pay Rs.33 million in August, 2015, after the police commenced their investigations in May 2015.
He further said investigations also revealed that the D.A. Rajapaksa Foundation is not a Statutory Board.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for the former Defence Secretary stated that there is no criminal aspect to this case. There was a civil contract from the beginning to the end. There is no wrongful act committed by Rajapaksa. There is no criminality in this case, de Silva added.
Finally he sought Court jurisdiction to extend the Interim Order until the next inquiry date. Further inquiry was fixed for January 25.
The Court of Appeal (CA) yesterday further extended until January 25, its Interim Order preventing police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act regarding a Magistrates Court inquiry.
The CA extended this Interim Order preventing police from acting under the Public Property Act against Rajapaksa, on the Galle Magistrates Court inquiry over a complaint that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.90 million.
On November 29, the Interim Order was issued on the basis of an ex parte proceeding by a two-judge-bench comprising Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne. This is pursuant to a writ petition filed by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
The Court upheld Rajapaksas version that the certificate issued under section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or violative of his legitimate expectations.
Rajapaksa cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director Shani Abeysekara, FCID Director Ravi Waidyalankara and the Attorney General as respondents.
Rajapaksa also seeks an order in the nature of a writ of prohibition preventing the respondents from proceeding or relying upon the certificate filed under and in terms of section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act against him.
Rajapaksa maintained that the offences against the Public Property Act contains a provision in section 8(1) as amended where, upon the certification by a Police Officer that the value of the matter exceeds Rs. 25,000, it will not be competent for the magistrates court unless in exceptional circumstances to release such a person on bail after recording reasons.
Rajapaksa stated that one such method was to say that there was a criminal offence committed by Rajapaksa regarding monies belonging to the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Board (SLLRDC).
Rajapaksa stated that recently he was informed that he is to be arrested. He further said that originally the proceedings reflect a possible charge of money laundering. He stated that there is no offence whatever in respect of the said matter.
He states that the D.A Rajapaksa Foundation, a statutory body, entered into a contract with the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Department for the construction of a monument at Medamulana in Weeraketiya. Rajapaksa states that there was no written contract.
He stated that, at all times the petitioner, the Foundation and SLLRDC acted on the basis that there was a contract between the SLLRDC and the foundation and that the foundation would pay to the SLLRDC lawfully due for the construction of the monument.
He states that the monument was unveiled on or about November 6, 2014 though not complete, because that was the death anniversary of the late D.A. Rajapakse.
The petitioner states that the government changed in January 2015 and the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Board came under the Megalopolis Ministry, under Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka.
In August of 2015, the Foundation received a request for a part payment which the Foundation paid. The petitioner pleads that thereafter he received a letter of demand. The petitioner states that the said Attorney, who sent the letter has on several occasions acted for and on behalf of the Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka.

Other countries should reconsider joining Ottawa Treaty -HRW
Other countries should reconsider joining the Ottawa Treaty to ban landmines following Sri Lankas accession to the treaty on Wednesday, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) said.
HRW Arms Director Steve Goose on Thursday said Sri Lankas accession should spur other nations that havent joined the landmine treaty to take another look at why they want to be associated with such an obsolete, abhorrent weapon.
This should spur other countries that havent joined the treaty to review their position and address any obstacles to joining it, he said.
Sri Lanka deposited its instrument of accession to the treaty with the United Nations in New York, becoming the 163rd country to join.
The Mine Ban Treaty comprehensively bans antipersonnel landmines, and requires destruction of stockpiles, clearance of mined areas, and assistance to victims of the weapons.
The HRW said Sri Lanka participated as an observer in the fast-track diplomatic Ottawa Process, which led to the adoption of the Mine Ban Treaty in September 1997, but said it could not sign due to its ongoing conflict with the LTTE.
Since then Sri Lank expressed its support for the humanitarian objectives of the Mine Ban Treaty and voted in favor of every annual UN General Assembly resolution on it.

Petition on Ambagamuwa PS re-fixed for support
A Fundamental Rights petition which sought an Interim Order restraining the Elections Commission from taking steps to hold elections for three Pradeshiya Sabhas, including the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha, was re-fixed for support by the Supreme Court yesterday.
The Supreme Courts two-Judge-bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice Anil Goonaratne, fixed the petition for support on January 8, since the Attorney General sought further time to obtain instructions from the Election Commission Chairman.
The Court was informed that the Election Commission Chairman is yet to receive notices. The Election Commission Chairman was re-noticed to appear in Court on the next date. The All Ceylon Buddhist Congress and the Chief Incumbent of the Sri Padasthana sought court's permission to intervene into this petition.
The petitioner, H.D.D. Nandaraja, a former member of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha, also seeks an Interim Order suspending the operation of the Gazette Notification issued by the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Governments, dated 2.11.2017 in respect of these Pradeshiya Sabhas until the final determination of this application.
The Petitioner stated that the Local Government Minister in declaring the dissolution of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Saba and constituting the aforesaid three Pradeshiya Sabhas has inter alia:
(1) Effected the sub-division of Local Government areas of the former Ambagaumwa Pradeshiya Sabha solely on an ethnic basis;
(2) Failed to consider the historical importance, significance and sacred value of the Sri Pada for the Buddhists, which was located within the local limits of the existing Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha;
(3) Failed to consider the identity and the rights of the historical inhabitants residing within the local limits of the existing Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha;
(4) Failed to assure due protection and fostering of Buddha Sasana (guaranteed by Article 9 of the Constitution), by placing Sri Pada, the most Sacred Place of worship of Buddhists and the sanctuary forming part and parcel thereof in immense danger of mismanagement and ill-treatment by non-Buddhists;
(5) Failed to consider the historical and social reasons and requirements for the demarcation of the existing boundaries of the Ambagauwa Pradeshiya Saba and the need to correspond to the limits of the Assistant Government Agents Division (Divisional Secretary);
(6) Failed to consider the equal rights for effective participation of the people in local government and development of the people living in the existing Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Saba limits and the right for equal distribution of the revenue, wealth and natural resources therein;
(7) Acted ultra-vires, arbitrary, capricious and violate the principle of Natural Justice and Rule of Law.
The petitioner said though there had been no date fixed by the Election Commission to call for nominations with regard to the elections of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha, he had made public announcements that such nominations would be called for Local Government bodies of the entire country together.
Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana with Counsel H.M. Thilakaratne, under the instructions of Nuwan Bellanthudawa, appeared for the petitioner.

Players with most sixes in a calendar year in ODIs
Men in Blue's opening warrior Rohit Sharma now has 45 ODI sixes to his name in the 2017 calendar year. He has been in sensational form this year and entertained the crowds with abundant big hitting.
The stand-in skipper for the limited-overs series against Sri Lanka has now surpassed former Aussie all-rounder Shane Watson's record of 42 sixes in 2011. Former Proteas captain AB de Villiers is at the top of the charts with a tally of 58 sixes to his name in the year 2015.
Rohit now has 162 sixes overall in ODI cricket which is also the fourth most sixes hit by an Indian batsman in the format. Considering his ability and the wide array of shots he holds in his arsenal, the right-hander is surely unstoppable when in fine touch. He also seems to be in a great mindset which is a good thing for the Indian team, before the start important overseas tour against South Africa next year.
De Villiers is on the top of another list of big hits with a total of 58 sixes to his name in 2015. Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi is the second name in that list with 48 sixes in 2002, but keeping in mind that Rohit has one more game left in this year, he needs three sixes to go past the Pakistani cricketer's record.
The ongoing three-match ODI series between hosts India and visitors Sri Lanka has been a thrilling one so far and as opposed to the expectation the third match will be the deciding encounter.
So, therefore, India's Rohit definitely has the opportunity to add another feather in his record book and secure his first series victory as the leader of the pack. If the Men in Blue are able to win the ODI series, then this will be India's sixth consecutive ODI series victory this year on the trot.

PM tells Vice Chancellors to stop university ragging
Kurunegala District UNP parliamentarian and Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam told the Daily News today (15) in Kuliyapitiya, Kurunegala that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe instructed all Vice Chancellors of state Universities yesterday (14) at a meeting held at Temple Trees, that all possible steps should be taken by the university administration to stop senior students ragging junior undergraduates at universities countrywide.
The Prime Minister instructed the Vice Chancellors to recruit new staff to carry out the task of stopping ragging at universities if necessary. When compared to the past, state universities seem to have faced a certain decline at present internationally and hence, all authorities concerned must plan meaningful programmes to maintain the quality standard and good recognition of Sri Lankan universities at international level in the future. Minister AkilaViraj Kariyawasam said the Prime Minister had thus instructed the Vice Chancellors who met the Premier yesterday at Temple Trees.

Polgahawela flyover complete
The construction work on the Polgahawela flyover in Kurunegala is now complete and it will soon be vested with the public, an official from the Higher Education and Highways Ministry said.
Since the flyover is to be constructed above the railway line, the massive traffic congestion that prevails in Polgahawela will be eased.
The flyover will not only ease the traffic congestion, but also reduce delays on the road, minimizing accidents and lowering the operational cost of vehicles. It will also ensure safe and efficient transportation for the people. He said the Polgahawela town experiences heavy traffic due to the Polgahawela railway station and the town is also the entry point to a number of cities.
The 883 metre-long Polgahawela flyover costing Rs.1.8 billion, will greatly benefit Polgahawela and Kurunagala (A 19) road users.
The project is funded by the Government of Spain and it commenced in April last year.
The Polgahawela Railway Station is located at an important railway junction where a number of trains operate daily to the North, up country and the East.
Around 130 trains travel through the Polgahawela rail junction resulting in long gate closures for approximately 400 minutes per day at the level crossing located along Polgahawela  Kegalle Road (A19) causing a severe traffic congestion.
The project will provide a permanent solution to this situation with the erection of a 883m-long steel flyover which comprises two lane carriageway and two pedestrian ways on either side.

Poll rivalry booms; wildlife threats gain expos
The end of the Railway strike, a huge burden on the public at the time of the GCE O/L examinations, removes a critical challenge to government with the approach of the Local Government polls. The Railway Trade Unions would have realized they were not having much support from the public, although there may have been sympathy for some of their demands, due to the hardships faced by the O/L exam students. The indications are the strike has in fact been suspended, and the Government will have to work out good negotiating situations in the coming weeks, especially after the GCE O/L and Christmas & New Year season. The proposal to have the Railway, Health and Education services to be Closed Services certainly need better clarification in the context of how this will help to meet future salary demands from public sector trade unions.
The Local Polls are moving into the politics of keen rivalry with the contest between the formal SLFP under Maithripala Sirisenas leadership and its rival lotus bud SLPP with the unofficial leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa, emerging as a contest for the hold over the SLFP, more than the issues of local government. The last week did see the rift within the Joint Opposition (JO) widen with one member of the MEP, Sriyani Wijewickrema MP from Digamadulla who won election to Parliament under the SLFP/UPFA, coming over to the SLFP leadership of President Sirisena. She was soon followed by three members of the Wimal Weerawansas National Freedom Front - its Deputy Leader Weerakumara Dissanayake, National Organiser Piyasiri Wijayanayake, and NCP Council member P. B. Kumara. This placed, Weerawansa, a major publicist of the JO, very much weakened and isolated, which in the coming days could have negative impacts on the electoral strategies of the SLPP.
The lack of organisation of the SLPP in preparing for nomination to the Local Polls is seen by the rejection of its nomination lists for important local government bodies of Maharagama, Weligama, Panadura, Agalawatte, Badulla and Mahiyangana, covering municipal councils, urban councils and pradeshiya sabhas. This is certainly no matter of misfortune, but shows poor study of the new systems and documentation for nominations, and certainly raised questions about the leadership of the SLPP and the JO in these affected areas. It is noteworthy that the areas include Maharagama, which has senior SLFP and MEP leaders within the JO, the Panadura and Kalutara areas which usually have a very active local leadership, and Uva Province where the leadership of the SLFP largely remains with the Sirisena led SLFP.
With the contests between the SLFP and SLPP in most areas, as well as the decision by the Sirisena wing to place some candidate under the Betel leaf symbol of the UPFA, in addition to the SLPs Chair symbol, the Sirisena  Rajapaksa contest is certainly moving to be of intense rivalry, with more shifts, jumps and leaps likely to be seen in the coming weeks, as the politics of advantage shows more importance, than issues of local government. There are also many allegations by poll watcher organisations of civil society that underworld and anti-social elements are being given nominations, raising questions about the success of the new electoral system to break the spread and hold of corruption in the electoral process.
UNP remains strong
Amidst these rivalries between the SLPP and SLFP, the UNP remains in a very strong position, with the support of most minority political parties and groups moving towards it. The efforts by the SLMC to have a more nominations for Muslims in Colombo, ejected by the UNP, and rivalries between the SLMC and ACMC on Muslim representation in majority Muslim areas, have not affected the UNPs hold in these areas. However, the overall anti-corruption thinking among the broader public, especially those who supported the UNP-backed Common Candidate for the Presidency in January 2015, do not share the enthusiasm of UNP supporters in the coming polls.
The UNP certainly has to face the criticism on corruption come from the Treasury bond exposure, and the necessity for Ravi Karunanayake and Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to leave their key portfolios. The report of the Presidential Commission on the Central Bank Bonds, due by December 31, is expected to have a major impact on the UNPs poll campaign. However, poll analysts are of the view that even weakened by the new allegations of corruption; the UNP remains the strongest party in the coming polls, and will obtain a plus factor from the rivalries of the Blues in the SLFP and SLPP.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will certainly have to lead a strong campaign in the coming weeks to re-affirm the UNPs position as the leading party in the local polls, especially with the necessity to fight the SLPP of Mahinda Rajapaksas leadership, as well as the opposition of the SLFP/UPFA of Maithripala Sirisenas leadership. The idea of the Unity Governments main parties  the UNP and SLFP having a no-contest pact did not materialize. However, as the campaign moves with rivalries and indications of future control of local bodies, there could be understandings that could not be realized before nominations, which could benefit the UNP.
The Wilpattu crisis
An important shift of politics from elections to the protection of nature was seen in this weeks Wild Life and Nature Protection Society (WPNS) organised protest at Vihara Maha Devi Park moving to the UN Office in Colombo, which drew considerable public support, showing a growing public interest in a crisis mounting in and near the Wilpattu National Park.
The speakers at Vihara Maha Devi Park raised urgent concerns about the increasing annexation of land from the largest national park in the country, and its boundary areas that also need protection, for the settling of hundreds of families. The efforts made by those carrying out these settlements to make the protests against the anti-nature and anti-environmental moves a to be anti-race and religion, were completely rejected and effectively criticized by the speakers who explained the huge damage done to the National Park, which needs protection as a national asset in the context of nature and the environment.
The protests went away from that of an anti-Muslim move, in view of the involvement of Minister Rishard Badurdeen in those resettlements of those displaced by the LTTE, with strong criticism also of the moves by State Minister Palitha Range Bandara to support different housing settlements in the area, and the action of Minister Lakshman Kiriella, to build two huge bridges and build roads in the nature reserve, which will further damage the much threatened wild life park, as well as nature and the environment that need maximum protection in the present conditions of the country. Speakers were not opposed to the resettlement of displaced persons, but emphasized the need to ensure that such re-settlement should not threaten, damage or destroy nature and the environment.
The WPNS protest also drew support from members of the public whose concerns have been increased, following the killing of the Galgamuva Tusker, as well as other tuskers in recent weeks, and the huge business reportedly going on in the export of tusks and ivory goods from Sri Lanka. The Minister of Wildlife is on record that the recent killing of tuskers is a well planned and executed conspiracy. The threats faced by the tuskers of this country are naturally linked to what is seen as the major threat to wildlife and nature by the human incursions at Wilpattu, backed politicians with varying interests.
The protesters led by the WPNS walked to the UN office in Colombo and handed over a petition with regard to the violations of the Ramsar Convention, the international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands. Sri Lanka is a signatory to the Ramsar Convention, signed in 1971, which is the oldest multilateral international conservation convention, and the only one to deal with one habitat or ecosystem type, wetlands. Sri Lanka has 165,000 hectares (410,000 acres) registered in the Wilpattu Ramsar Wetland Custer, in addition to other Rasmar registered reservations. The protesters look forward to the Ramsar Convention office, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature that works closely with it, will take this matter up with the Government with no delay.
Thursdays events in Colombo saw an important new trend in the politics of protest, with the public moving away from the tradition of party politics to areas of importance to society that are not supported by political parties, or are being avoided by the political parties for electoral, ethnic and other interests.
Tall Tree
As Christmas approaches Sri Lankans could have some pleasure, at having the Guinness record for the worlds tallest artificial Christmas tree, and beating China is something today. It matters little at having no relevance to the spirit of Christmas, but of great joy to Minister Arjuna Ranatunga.

Polls sans polythene
In a country where elections are fairly frequent, election propaganda is a fact of life. Smiling candidates adorn our walls while multi-coloured banners extol their virtues. Our eyes and ears are inundated with television and radio advertisements singing the praises of political parties and candidates.
These candidates usually do not think about the damage caused to the environment in advertising their suitability for whatever public body. With the Local Government election only three months away, the time has come to take stock of this issue.
Although a ban on polythene decorations, banners and buntings had been in effect for all elections in previous years, this was observed more in the breach by candidates of all parties. Polythene is relatively cheap, easy to procure, easy to handle and durable. Hence its appeal to politicians who want to get the maximum exposure and publicity at polls time. After all, polythene is generally regarded as the easiest way to decorate public rallies of politicians.
Now President Maithripala Sirisena has intervened to put a full stop to this practice that is not only an eyesore but also causes harm to the environment. The President, who has taken many initiatives to safeguard the environment during the last three years, has instructed the Central Environment Authority (CEA) to ban the use of polythene for election decorations. The President has also told the CEA to take strict action in accordance with the law against those who violate the ban regardless of stature or political affiliation.
The President has also ordered the CEA to hold a meeting with all stakeholders and make them aware about the regulation. The President gave these instructions during a meeting at the Presidential Secretariat held to discuss matters related to improving efficiency in waste management at local authorities.
We hope that all political parties, independent groups and individual candidates will take heed of the Presidential Directive. There are alternative methods such as paper-based posters (which should be pasted only at designated boards and hoardings) as well as TV/radio newspaper advertisements to get the message across.
Besides, the election is being held under a different electoral system sans the infamous district-wide preferential vote. This alone will cut down drastically on the need for mass-scale propaganda materials as candidates will be vying only for a particular ward or electoral division. Electioneering costs will come down as a result. This will also give a better chance to the women candidates who generally shy away from the propaganda blitzes and intimidatory tactics of some of the wealthy male candidates.
In any case, laws are now being contemplated to enact a funding and spending ceiling for candidates, after reports emerged that some individual candidates had spent more than Rs.500 million for propaganda activities covering the entire district during the last General Election. This is a staggering amount by any means. There is a general belief in society that candidates are given generous donations by businessmen, who in turn seek favours and contracts once they are elected. This is a vicious cycle that needs to be stopped. Most countries already have laws that compel candidates to declare their funding sources and Sri Lanka should follow suit soon.
Candidates should be encouraged to advertise more on electronic and print media, instead of pasting posters and putting up banners, polythene, plastic or otherwise. With 8,000 candidates in the fray at the LG elections, giving free airtime to all candidates is out of the question, but the major political parties and independent groups should be given an opportunity to present their case before the public via radio and TV. Moreover, to keep local organising costs down, pocket meetings and door-to-door visits can be a more viable alternative to big rallies which are much more costly. The candidates own vehicle can also be used legally to advertise his or her credentials.
All candidates must also take care not to disturb children who are sitting the GCE Ordinary Level examination and students at schools during school hours, after the schools start for the first term on January 2, 2018. Indeed, the election activities should cause minimum disruption to the day-to-day lives to the people. This is also the reason why LG and Provincial Councils elections are now usually held on Saturdays, which is more or less a holiday for most people, even though overall costs could be a bit more as expenses such as overtime for elections staff have to be factored in.
Voters should look for candidates who pledge to protect the environment and natural resources including wildlife in their own areas. They should walk the talk, by not having any polythene or plastic decorations at their rallies. With garbage disposal having become a major issue recently, voters especially in urban areas should look out for candidates who have other plans for garbage, such as recycling and power generation. Above all, the onus is on the voters to select candidates who obey elections laws and normal laws, are non-violent and determined to serve the public at grassroots level - which is the very purpose of Local Government.

Red Star over Himalayas
A red star has arisen over the Himalayas, the top most mountain range of the world. Nepal, which gave the world the first armed revolution of the 21st century, has now consummated the transition from a feudal monarchy to a modern secular federative republic.
Communists of Nepal, having abandoned their sectarian division formed a coalition comprising the Unified Marxist  Leninist Communist Party of Nepal (CPN  UML) and the Communist Party of Nepal  Maoist. This coalition has won a landslide victory at the Parliamentary and Provincial Assembly elections held in two stages on November 26th and December 7th, 2017.
Interestingly the elections were held under a hybrid system under which 275 members were elected to the Lower House of Parliament called the House of Representatives in which 165 or 60 percent were on a first-past-the post system and the rest 40 percent or 110 under proportional representation. In the Upper House called the National Assembly 56 will be elected from Provincial Assemblies and Executive members of village and Municipal Councils. Another three members will be appointed by the President making a total of 59 members.
PR vote counting concluded on Friday and by the time this column was being written it was clear that only five parties--UML, NC, CPN Maoist, FSFN (Federal Socialist Forum Nepal) and RJPN (Rastriya Janata Party Nepal), --are likely to secure parliament seats under PR category. Electoral law has a provision to allocate parliamentary seats under PR category only to those which garner three percent of the total votes cast in the elections.
The fact that Nepal, a country of nearly 30 million people and 92 living languages and more than five major religions including Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam and Kirant, could arrive at a consensus on a new constitution after several years of deliberations in an elected Constituent Assembly is in itself a rare and laudable achievement. Though Hindus comprise nearly 82 percent of the population and Buddhists could claim the country as the birth place of the Buddha neither of them demanded a privileged position or arrogantly claimed superiority over others.
Nepal also provides an example of a hitherto unitary state under a Monarch transforming itself to a federative republic. It could also overcome pressure by imperial powers and world bodies dominated by them to derail the reconciliation between the erstwhile warring parties in the 10 year civil war that left over 17,000 killed.
The election victory of the Communists gives the country a fair degree of stability so that development could proceed untrammeled. However, a huge challenge faced by the new Government would be to balance its foreign policy as the country is sandwiched between two Asian giants - China and India.
The victory also proved wrong those who prophesied after the fall of the Soviet Union that Communism would be a word unknown in the 21st century or declared the ultimate triumph of capitalism and the end of history.
The election result could strengthen Sino-Nepalese cooperation and India will have to evolve a new strategy to guarantee that Nepal would remain friendly without becoming a satellite state of China.
Trumps Jerusalem decision boomerangs
United States president Donald Trumps decision to recognize Jerusalem has boomeranged as the world community has openly criticized it in no uncertain terms.
French President Emmanuel Macron said: I do not agree with this decision and I disapprove of it because it contravenes international law, it contravenes the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council...
The 57 member Islamic Cooperation Council (IOC) in a statement said, we consider that this dangerous declaration, which aims to change the legal status of the city [Jerusalem], is null and void and lacks any legitimacy.
Chinese Foreign Ministry in a statement said: China fully supports and advances the Middle East peace process. We support the just cause of the Palestinian people to restore their legitimate national rights and stand behind Palestine in building an independent, full sovereignty state along the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. Turkish President Erdogan said that President Trumps decision throws the region into a ring of fire.
Meanwhile Cuba in a most comprehensive statement has expressed solidarity with the Palestinian struggle. In view of its comprehensiveness we reproduce it in full below:
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba expresses its deepest concern and rejection for the unilateral declaration by the President of the United States of the city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, which constitutes a serious and flagrant violation of the Charter of the UN, of International Law and of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.
This intention of the United States Government to modify the historic status of Jerusalem violates the legitimate interests of the Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic nations, will have serious consequences for stability and security in the Middle East, will further increase tensions in this region and will impede any effort aimed at resuming peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.
Cuba calls on the Security Council to fulfill the responsibility given to it by the UN Charter in the maintenance of international peace and security, to adopt the necessary decisions and to demand from Israel an immediate end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories and of aggressive policies and colonizing practices, as well as compliance with the resolutions adopted by that body on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian issue.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs ratifies that Cuba will continue to support a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on a two-State solution that allows the Palestinians the right to self-determination and to have an independent and sovereign State, with its capital in East Jerusalem and the pre-1967 borders.

Prior to the 'Jana hamuwa ' the Minister and guests were conducted in a procession from Eheliyagoda - Panawala junction to the venue of the new elections office where the Minister opened the office.
Minister Fernando said though there was a slight delay in fulfilling the promises given by the government prior to the last general election, the 'Yaha palana' Government tries its best to maintain peace and harmony throughout the country in a transparent manner. In a comment to those who blame the government for not netting in the rogues, he noted that there is another group engaged in protecting these rogues.

Russia restricts tea supplies from Sri Lanka
Russia has temporarily restricted the import of all Sri Lankan agricultural products, including tea.
This is after an alleged detection of a beetle in the packaging on one consignment of tea from the island. The restriction, announced by Russian agricultural safety watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor, will go into effect on December 18.
Reached for comment, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said, This is a matter of serious concern for the authorities in Sri Lanka, and the relevant local stakeholders and Russian authorities are being consulted with a view to address the issue.
In a press release, the Sri Lanka Tea Board expressed doubt that the beetle, of the Khapra subspecies, assuredly came from Sri Lanka.
This beetle is a pest of grain crops such as rice, and has never been associated with tea. The Sri Lanka Tea Board is of the view that the specimen discovered in the packaging material may have remained in the shipping container concerned following the use of this container for the transport of grain on a previous occasion, not necessarily of Sri Lankan origin.
Still, the Tea Board expressed its continued desire to protect the standards and quality for which Ceylon tea is renowned worldwide, adding that they are working with tea producers and exporters to ensure that phytosanitary and other standards are rigorously followed in all shipments of tea originating in Sri Lanka. As well, they iterated their belief that the present case, if in fact genuine, is an isolated incident.
The Tea Boards statement also reiterated the temporary nature of Russias restrictions, which will only last until the completion of negotiations and clarification of the situation. Accordingly, Minister of Plantation Ministries Navin Dissanayake will visit Russia as soon as the necessary logistical arrangements are made and work with his Russian counterparts to resolve this problem. The statement emphasized that the Ministry of Plantation Industries and the Sri Lanka Tea Board are working very closely with all the relevant agencies of government, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Commerce, to restore normal trade between the two countries as soon as possible. Currently, Sri Lankan tea imports make up approximately 23% of Russias tea market, according to Russias Rusteacoffee association. Speaking to Russias RIA news agency, the head of Rusteacoffee said that its members will ask the Rosselkhoznadzor to resume tea imports from Sri Lanka but with tougher controls.

Six Indian cricketers with Engineering Degree who have excelled in sports
Looking at their talents, skills and achievements in their profession, sometimes we tend to think sports persons are only good at what they do or where they are in and bad in other things.
We think they only play sports and dont do other things in life. But they are not.
Besides pursuing their passion and excelling in the sports they are in, there are many who are also quite good and excellent in other fields as well.
There are many who are quite good in studies and have done excellently well academically and even hold high degrees. In this post, we take a look at some of the Indian cricketers who hold an engineering degree and have still excelled at the sports at the highest level.
1. ANIL KUMBLE
Former team India captain, Anil Kumble is easily the most famous engineer turned cricketer. With 619 test and 337 ODI wickets, he is the highest wicket-taker for India in both the formats.
He was Indias main strike bowler for most of his career, which spans almost two decades, and has been foxing the batsmen across the world.
Kumble completed his schooling from National College Basavanagudi. He has a BE degree in Mechanical Engineering from Rashtreeya Vidyalaya College of Engineering (RVCE), Bangalore. He got his degree in 1991-92 and also made his ODI debut around the same time.
2. JAVAGAL SRINATH
Although, Javagal Srinath made great strides as a cricketer and then later as a match referee, he feels that education is also important in the grooming of sportspersons.
He is arguably one of Indias best fast bowlers. Srinath holds a BE degree in Instrumentation Technology from Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering, Mysuru.
3. RAVICHANDRAN ASHWIN
Ravichandran Ashwin is currently Indias leading bowler across different formats. The way in which he approaches cricket has more often than not left the experts to make conclusions about his solid background and upbringing.
Ashwin has a B.Tech degree in Information Technology from SSN College of Engineering, Chennai. In fact, like most of the engineers of his generation, he joined a software company post-graduation.
4. KRISHNAMACHARI SRIKANTH
Krishnamchari Srikanth is another cricketer who holds an engineering degree. Srikanth is an Electrical Engineer from College of Engineering, Guindy in Chennai. Although he used to play cricket at different levels during his engineering days, but it was only during his fourth year of college that he thought he could become a test cricketer.
5. SRINIVASARAGHAVAN VENKATARAGHAVAN
Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghvans statistics of 156 wickets from 57 matches may not seem very impressive, but he was undoubtedly one of the best spinners to have represented India. Post-retirement Venkataraghavan took up umpiring and was a member of the ICCs elite panel of umpires for a long time.
Venkataraghavan is a qualified engineer from College of Engineering, Guindy in Chennai. He is an all-rounder in true sense - great player, respected umpire and an engineer by qualification.
6. ERAPALLI PRASANNA
E.A.S Prasanna was probably one of the first among the engineers to make an impact on the cricket field. The former off-spinner holds an engineering degree from the National Institute of Engineering, Mysuru. Along with BS Chandrashekhar, S Venkataraghavan and Bishen Singh Bedi, he formed a quartet of spinners in the Indian team in the 1960s and 1970s.
Great cricketers they are, all!

Turkey rescues migrants from Aegean rocks
TURKEY: Turkish coast guards on Thursday rescued dozens of migrants stranded on rocks off western Turkey when their Greece-bound vessel hit trouble.
The inflatable boat, carrying 51 people, started to sink in the Aegean sea not far from the coastal town of Dikili, the Turkish coast guard said in a statement.
Television footage showed the stricken vessel bobbing up and down next to a rocky outcrop, while a coast guard helicopter hovered above to conduct a rescue.
In the initial stage of the operation, five children and a woman were winched to safety by the helicopter team, the coast guard said.
Eventually, all 51, including 15 children, were rescued and brought back to Dikili port.
Earlier reports had put the number on board at 68.
Among the group were migrants from Syria, Afghanistan, Angola and Somalia, State-run news agency Anadolu said.
Nine people were taken to hospital, it reported. There was no indication of any casualties.
Over a million people, mainly fleeing the war in Syria, crossed to European Union member Greece from Turkey in 2015 after the onset of the bloc's worst migration crisis since World War II.
Turkey struck a deal with the EU in 2016 in a effort to stem the flow of migrants into Europe, and agreed to take back illegal migrants landing on Greek islands in exchange for incentives including financial aid.
The deal, chastised by rights groups, sharply curbed the number of migrants seeking to cross the Aegean Sea.
Migrants were sent back to Turkey from the Greek islands in the initial weeks after the deal was signed, but afterwards the pace slowed drastically.
Recently however, eight migrants were brought back to Dikili from the island of Lesbos and taken to refugee camps inside Turkey, Anadolu reported Thursday.
The return comes after Greece's Kathimerini daily reported Athens persuaded Turkey to accept migrant returns from the mainland in order to reduce critical overcrowding in its refugee camps.
Last week, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made the first visit of a Turkish head of state to Greece since 1952.
The trip was strained after Erdogan spoke about revising borders and criticised Greek treatment of its Muslim minority, although officials on both sides described it as hugely productive. - AFP

## Title: The tyranny of ignorance!

The tyranny of ignorance!
Trotsky stood for means can be justified only by its end. But the end in its turn needs to be justified. From the Marxist point of view, which expresses the historical interests of the proletariat, the end is justified if it leads to increasing the power of man over nature and to the abolition of the power of man over man. Are we to understand then, that in achieving this end anything is permissible That is permissible, he answered, which really leads to the liberation of mankind.
Since this end can be achieved only through revolution, the liberating morality of the proletariat of necessity is endowed with a revolutionary character. It irreconcilably counteracts not only religious dogma but every kind of idealistic fetish, these philosophic gendarmes of the ruling class. It deduces a rule for conduct from the laws of the development of society, thus primarily from the class struggle.
Investigation of human history shows the struggle of classes; struggle based on socio-economic classes. On this manner we arrive at this law of all laws. Obviously liberal politicians vehemently argue against this kind of morality for politics. They will seek refuge in idealistic moral judgments. But in reality bourgeoise politicians too defend what they do on the basis of same argument, the end justifies the means.
Violation of human rights
Only the end is different: the aim is liberal democracy where open market will give justice to everybody. Liberals say Mahinda Rajapaksa is wrong not necessarily because he robbed public money but with massive violation of human rights. In the same manner Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is defended by liberals claiming he has worked with the aim of liberal democracy even in the bond issue.
Still we hear the noise from all sides that politicians are corrupt and all are bandits of one kind or the other. Explanation is that is the nature of the game. Politics is a game played by corrupt elements. It is simple as that. The telling line is this: Power consists of making others play your version of their reality.
Accordingly all politicians are automatically in a trap. One is not free to break out of this; hence they all become corrupt  that is the end of history. However in this country in the past there were politicians who did not rob in any way but spend their own money to serve the policies of their government. This was true for all kinds of politicians; liberals, conservatives and Samasamajist. Even the most conservative politician did not take public money for private expenditure.
Today things have changed. Now, one has to subjugate others, so that others play the game as you wish. Even the moral law of end justifies the means cannot be applied. Because this definition of power can have applications outside the classical associations of power, i.e. the State, the military, use of force, visible subjugation and hierarchies. Authoritarianism is not only about keeping people out of decision-making processes, imposing arbitrary laws and creating and forcing people to practice a culture of impunity.
There is also a soft and non-intrusive kind of control which persuades a different kind of inhabitation, claiming that is the cultured way of living.
Laws and guns
However is it not false to say that there is no god or a vile set of big bad men out there plotting the dimensions of common living, but society does get structured in ways that are more likely to produce the outcomes preferred by the powerful The structures as well as those located in arm-twisting positions within them, not only define the parameters of resistance for the most part, but act in a fascistic manner arousing racism and religious sectarianism. Of course rupture is not impossible, but remains to be done by positive intervention.
While laws and guns can obtain obedience, the more insidious instruments of subjugation are those which are so goes-without-saying that few will even question why or how they came-without-saying. There are hidden appreciations and assumptions that creep in. It is also called taking things for granted, in the worst sense of that term. We inhabit realities which we believe or are led to believe are not only unchangeable but are proper or at least the best they could be. Or do not we throw our hands up in aristocratic resignation, convincing ourselves that even our best efforts would not change anything; because they come from heroic ancestors. I am not saying that all conformities are enslaving; a certain code of ethics, for example, can be necessary, one could argue, to maintain social coherence and keeping separation and break up, out.
It would be quite alright if it was a conscious choice, but for the most part people are ill-informed and less given to reflecting on the things-as-they-are. It is one thing to make sure one doesnt step on tyrannys foot because one knows the consequences. But it is quite another to give that foot a wide berth because thats-how-it-should-be.
If one takes some time to analyze the last 100 acts, i.e. from the expression that materialized on face at a given moment to choice of sari and the use of certain words to address others, one will know that we inhabit rule-universes as though it was second nature to do so in the ways we do.
Authoritarians and dictators
Not all authoritarians and dictators arrive with a big placard and a comprehensive communications. Nor do they come with a campaign claiming tyranny and demanding acquiescence on this account. The use of one word instead of another, the choice of voice over silence or vice versa in specific moments, the preference for this friends company and not that of that friends, none of these things is totally innocent although we might brush such claims off as nonsense.
The most pernicious of tyrannies are not those which we do not have the strength to counter; but those which we embrace on account of ignorance and greed for higher connections. While laws and guns can obtain obedience, the more insidious instruments of subjugation are those which are so goes-without-saying that few will even question why or how they came-without-saying.
It is also called taking things for granted, in the worst sense of that term. We inhabit realities which we believe or are led to believe as not only unchangeable but also as proper or at least the best they could be. Or we throw our hands up in resignation, convincing ourselves that even our best efforts would not change anything. The most pernicious of tyrannies are not those which we do not have the strength to overthrow, but those which we embrace on account of ignorance and fear of heritage.

UN calls for legal reforms
UN representatives speaking in Colombo on Friday, said Sri Lanka must reform its legal system to meet UN standards.
The three-member Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, who were in Sri Lanka on a two-week official visit, commended the government for its continuing engagement with UN human rights mechanisms.
The visit of the Working Group and the recent visits of other UN Special Procedures are a clear example of such engagement, they said in their end-of- mission report.
They also said the countrys recent acceptance of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against torture was a positive sign and praised the governments National Human Rights Action Plan.
Many issues raised by the Working Group are consistent with the commitments made by the government in its National Action Plan, they said.
But in a visit that included inspections of 30 detention centers and interviews with more than 100 imprisoned persons, the working group members said that urgent action was required to remedy the current situation.
Court proceedings were affected by excessive and unjustified delays, while suspects remained in detention indefinitely, UN Working Group member Leigh Toomey said. The presumption of innocence and due process were yet to be fully recognized.
The panel recommended repealing special powers enacted during states of emergency, particularly the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1979, which they said was one of the key enablers of arbitrary detention for over four decades in this country.
Any new legislation must be in accordance with international human rights law and best practices, they said.
In the meantime, citizens rights are still being violated by an excessive use of remand, a lack of effective alternatives to detention, an outdated legal framework and reliance on confessions often extracted under torture, duress, or coercion, they said.
The three-member delegation of Leigh Toomey, Jose Antonion Guevara Bermudez, and Elina Steinerte also met with government officials, judges, lawyers, and civil society organizations.
They travelled to Colombo, Negombo, Anuradhapura, Vavuniya, Trincomalee and Polonnaruwa.

The Russian national who appeared before the CID as ordered several times, had failed to do so subsequently.
Investigations later revealed that he had escaped from the country.
Investigations made by the Foreign Ministry had revealed that Manokin had fled the country during the time a Russian team arrived in Sri Lanka to discuss arrangements for the sale of a Russian ship to Sri Lanka.

Can Havies turn tables against unbeaten Kandy today
Can Havelock Sports Club turn tables against unbeaten Kandy Sports Club in their Dialog A division inter-club league rugby tournament first round
final match at Havelock Park at 6.30 pm under lights today will be the question among the local rugby fraternity.
Havelock SC will miss the services of their experienced national skipper cum granite hard number eight Sudarshana Muthuthantttri due to him being
overseas, while Sri Lanka national sevens star Kevin Dixon will not return to the side for this all important encounter after sustaining a serious jaw injury.
Burly forward Liston Flatney will start as one of the prop forwards for todays game alongside last years skipper Dushmantha Priyadarshana, pushing Lasindu Ishan karunathilake to play in his pet position as number eight.
The Kandy eight led by national player cum number eight Buwaneka Udangamuwa will have the services of Shehan Pathirana, Soyuru Anthony,
Jason Dissanayake, Ganuka Dissanayake and Ashan Darling to give a terrific display in the loose.
Havelocks have been hard at practices under the leadership of their captain and second row forward Jason Melder this week and they are aiming for a morale-boosting win in their home grounds at Havelock Park.
Mean while Kandy SC cannot afford to have any mistakes in this game and will have to play really well to topple the Havies side since Havelocks are playing in their home grounds in Havelock Park.
Even if Havelocks win this game, Kandy will go through to head the league championship points table due to the luxury of total bonus extra points and total number of tries that they are presently enjoying over Havies.
Going by the two teams performances Kandy are definite favourites to pull this game through but in all probability it can turn out to be a closely fought out affair if Havies give a good fight to the hill capital boys.
Kandy SC (Probable XV) Ganuka Dissanayake, Uchitha Jayasuriya, Ashan darling, Shehan Dimitri, Soyuru Anthony, Jason Dissanayake, Shehan Pathirana, Buwaneka Udangamuwa, Roshan Weeraratne and Fazil Marija, Richard Darmapala, Gayan Weeraratne(Captain), Danushka Ranjan, Anurudda Willwara, Nigel Ratwatte or Thilina Wijesinghe

CEB employees continue fast
Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) employees continued their fast for the fifth consecutive day yesterday. This is against irregular increments granted to CEB engineers and that the cutting back of their own overtime payments and bonuses.
Joint Trade Union Alliance Convener Ranjan Jayalal alleged that the former Mahinda Rajapaksa Government bribed the engineers in November 2014 with an increment and assured them that this would be added to their basic salary after the January 8, 2015 elections.
An agreement was thus signed between the engineers and the previous regime and the engineers received a salary increment for three years.The agreement further stated that a 30 percent salary increment will be added to the basic salary by December 2014.
But, the tables started to turn with defeat of Rajapaksa in January 2015 and the Engineers Union which was in control issued a circular stating that all salary increments including the illegal ones should come into effect by January 2015,Jayalal said.
He added that when Champika Ranawaka was appointed as the Power and Energy Minister during the 100 day government in 2015, protests were held at the National Salaries and Cadre Commission, Ministry of Finance and Planning and the Treasury. Cabinet thereafter had released a statement that they had given no approval for the salary increase and thus it was illegal. Then we complained to the CID, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. They told us to wait until they provided a solution. Then after the election, with the appointment of Minster Ranjith Siyambalapitiya as the Power and Energy, we were told to wait a year but no solutions have been provided to us so far, Jayalal said.
In the wake of these illegal increments the salary ration has become 1:9 between an average worker and engineer, which was earlier 1:6.
When the salary increments were presented for Cabinet approval, Jayalal explained that they opposed it and as a result alleged that their overtime payments, bonuses and even donations during disasters were cut.
The Unions have threatened to continue their strike for another two days. The workers are under pressure because their incomes have been cut down. We want our OT payments and bonuses to be restored. It is not fair for us to ask for an illegal increment like the engineers. This is why we decided to go on strike, Jayalal said.

Development should benefit public not a family: Patali
The government focuses on development projects that would have a positive impact on the public and not on those that would benefit a family, as during the previous regime, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, yesterday.
He added that a project to construct a monument in memory of a politician's father with Rs. 90 million out of public funds has no benefit to the public.
He made these observations at the ceremonial opening of the Gampaha Bus Stand-2 by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The bus stand was constructed by the Urban Development Authority utilizing the funds of Sukitha Purawara Town Development Programme of the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry under the direction of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Minister Ranawaka said the construction of a defence headquarter complex commenced in Battaramulla at a cost of Rs. 62,000 million and it is only second to the Pentagon.
"It commenced by selling a land at Galle Face for Rs, 8,000 million," the Minister added. "However, we have had to bear the burden. Point five percent of the project had been remitted to an account of the architect who designed it. With that money, offices in Oruwela were constructed."
Minister Ranawaka said the glass for the fish tank at the Arcade constructed during the previous regime is Rs. 65 million. "The projects should be carried out with the least money and at a high standard," the Minister added.
He also said the projects should be implemented with the support of the people and not forcefully. "The lands should not be acquired forcefully," Minister Ranawaka said. "On the other hand, illegal constructions should be removed with the assistance of the people. During these two years, over 6,000 slums in Colombo have been removed and 400 houses are being removed today at Vauxhall Street in Colombo. But no person has staged a protest because they were not done forcefully by the military."
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and UNP Gampaha District MP Ajith Mannapperuma also spoke.

Dilantha to World Championship stardom
Lankan motor racing hero of international fame, Dilantha Malagamuwa has once again made his country proud by winning the AM class category third place in the second race of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals and thereby securing fifth place in the overall World Standings.
The Fdration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) sanctioned top notched World Finals was worked off from November 16 to 19 with the participation of 160 competitors representing racing teams from USA, Europe and Asia at the Imola Racing Circuit in Italy.
Dilantha's achievement will go down in Sri Lanka's annals of motor racing as a first of its kind triumph in a World Championship. Dilantha faced an unfortunate incident during the first race of the World finals on November 18 where his car crashed while trying to overtake the car running at third position which resulted in him being knocked out of the race. But he was fortunate to earn qualification for the second race as he completed 75% of the first race and placed 11th due to his good timing. Dilantha was performing extremely well in the second race on November 19 coming close to overtaking the car running at second place with just five minutes to complete the race when suddenly the marshals waved the Red Flag signing the stop of the race due to a crash.
Dilantha was delighted that Sri Lankan fans came to cheer him at Imola Racing Circuit. It was an emotional moment to the Lankan racing ace when Motorsports TV correspondent Dakota interviewed him. Dilantha went on to say: "I am the happiest sportsman in the world with these people (Sri Lankan fans) behind me".
A felicitation ceremony and launch of Dilango Racing Social Society' programme was held at the Movenpick Hotel, Colombo under the patronage of Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara recently. The Sports Minister praised Dilantha as the pioneer of Sri Lanka's international motor racing who fought a solitary battle with minimum facilities to earn fame in the international scene.
"Dilantha's road to stardom is not a bed of roses. He came in the hard way and it is sad that he did not get the proper recognition and sponsorship deals from the local companies. He is racing with the Lion flag and has been a great ambassador for Sri Lanka across the globe. The Sports Ministry alone cannot sponsor his international events as we have a very limited budget for all sports. I have already spoken to Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga and he has pledged his support to assist Dilantha. I will also make arrangements after discussing with the President to join hands with the Tourist Board, SriLankan Airlines, Tea Board and Tourism Development Authority to support Dilantha in his future international events," Dayasiri said.
"Dilantha has proved his talent and he is determined to win a World Championship event. We all know that he has the ability and courage to do so, so we must help him in this endeavour. Dilantha is serving as a special consultant to develop Sri Lankan motor racing and we have to support him to reach international stardom," the Sports Minister further added.
When asked about his preparation for future international events Dilantha explained that top level international competitions needs huge sponsorship backups and the 'Dilango Racing Social Society' will lay a strong fan base and activities to raise funds for such international events. "We are planning to open a 'Dilango Racing Souvenir Shop' in Kirulapone where the proceedings will not only go for my racing career, but 10% of the profits will be donated to the 'Little Hearts Project' to save children with congenital heart problems. I would also like to thank Green Tel and Laughs Gas for helping me throughout my racing career and hope they will continue to help me," Dilantha said.

## Title: Don Bradmans 334 at Headingley, 1930

Don Bradmans 334 at Headingley, 1930
[continuing our series]
It was, quite simply, a sustained assault the ferocity of which English cricket, indeed cricket in general, had never before experienced: the 21-year-old Donald Bradman, all 5ft 7in of him, carting the England bowling attack of 1930  an attack that had won an Ashes series 4-1 in Australia little more than a year before  to all parts of Headingley in a barrage that saw him score 309 runs on the opening day. It is a record that, even in these comparatively switch-hitting, trampoline-batted days of Twenty20-tinged Test match thrash, has never been surpassed.
It seems strange to think of Bradman, now with his own private suite in the pantheon of greats where he looks down on his dominion from a pedestal built of record books and bowlers broken spirits, as anything other than the batting behemoth he was but in 1930 he arrived in England with only four Test matches under his belt and having already felt the painful blow of the axe. He had made his international debut in the first Ashes Test of 1928-29 in Brisbane (a game which England won by 675 runs) and was promptly dropped for the second. Injuries brought him back into the side and a couple of centuries followed, although England cruised to an emphatic 4-1 series victory.
Plenty in England were unconvinced he was cut out to cope on the countrys rain-warped pitches. The Surrey captain Percy Fender, who covered the 1928-29 series, recognised his precocity but felt that he will always be in the category of brilliant and unsound ones. He does not inspire me with any confidence that he desires to take the only course that will lead him to a fulfilment of that promise.
The warning signs were there  in January 1930 his 452 not out for New South Wales against Queensland in the Sheffield Shield had set a world record  but Bradmans account of his arrival and first few days in England smacks not of a steely-eyed nemesis hell bent on the destruction of the lands medium-pacers but has the ring of no one more than Terry Pratchetts Twoflower, wandering round the country in wide-eyed bliss while unseen pickpockets hover and thin-moustachioed spivs fix their grins and move in for the kill.
There were the seasickness, the constant bewilderment at the sights and sounds of England, the gushing amazement of a Wembley Cup final and the sight of the German Graf Zeppelin flying overhead. He asked Neville Cardus for a list of books that might help him to develop his mind and enlarge his conversation. It would be no surprise to discover a scale model of Stonehenge, a stick of Blackpool rock and an I Love London T-shirt finding their way into his suitcase before the trip was out. But while Bradman may have arrived a tyro, he departed a tyrant, his supreme dominance established by 2,960 runs at an average of 98.66, scores of 236, 185, 252, 191, 254, 232 and 205, and capped by that insatiable innings at Headingley.
The entirety of Englands 1928-29 squad were available for selection for the series. There existed a general feeling of confidence that the side chosen by the Australian authorities to come to England in pursuit of the mythical Ashes would fail in the object of their endeavours, wrote Wisdens editor, Charles Stewart Caine. In other words, the home side expected to win and to win handsomely. Only four members of the 1930 Australia squad had been to England before and Bradman was out of his comfort zone  I found it difficult for instance to adjust myself to the idea of wearing a sweater, blazer and overcoat before a roaring fire awaiting my turn to bat, he wrote of the chilly May conditions. He nevertheless began the tour with 236 against Worcestershire and 185 at Leicester. The 78 that followed against Yorkshire therefore represented something of a flop. Day after day he cut and drove and hooked bowlers right and left, never raising the ball from the ground, wrote Cardus in Cricket All The Year.
A mammoth 252 against Surrey and 191 against Hampshire meant 1,000 runs in May (despite the weather) and put him in fairly decent nick for the first Test, where he scored 131 in the second innings as England, who enjoyed the better of the conditions, won by 93 runs.
That would be his fourth highest score of the series. His 254 in the second Test at Lords was, thought Bradman, technically the best innings of my life. The power and the ease, the fluent, rapid, vehement, cold-blooded slaughter were beyond sober discussion, reckoned Cardus. Australia declared their first innings on 729 for six and went on to win by seven wickets.
Then to Headingley. Australia won the toss and opted to bat but lost Archie Jackson with two on the board. That brought Bradman to the crease and by 12.50pm he had his century, joining Victor Trumper and Charlie Macartney as the only cricketers  at that time  to score Test tons before lunch on the first day.
Richard Tyldesley at one oclock actually bowled a maiden over to Bradman: from internal and external evidence I concluded that it was one of the cleverest bits of bowling he has achieved in his hard-working career, reports Cardus in his report from Leeds in the Guardian.
The Australia captain, Bill Woodfull, batted steadily at the other end. When he was dismissed in the afternoon session the pair had put on 192 for the second wicket. Bradmans share was 142. I imagine the England bowlers were trying to get Woodfull out  leaving Bradman to Providence, writes Cardus. Not often is an attack reduced to trying to get the stonewaller out while washing its hands of the brilliant player as a problem insoluble, and apparently everlastingly so.
The highest score against England prior to the series, George Headleys 223 in Kingston earlier that year, was steadily constructed over the best part of two days. Bradman had made 219 by tea, hammering 30 boundaries in the process. The great Cardus, never the most understated, was clearly filing pieces of copy throughout the day and by late afternoon was letting his pen off the leash. At four oclock Bradman reached 200, after three hours and a half of cricket which for mingled rapidity and security is unparalleled in my experience. Then: Bradman arrived at 288 in five hours and a half out of a grand Australian total of 414: no chance to hand had he given and not more than three strokes had he shown which told us it is human to err. And finally: From the last ball of the day Bradman, by a superb drive through the covers, a stroke handsome enough for any batsman who has ever done honour to cricket, hit his 42nd boundary. That was a royal way to finish a day which Australia will not forget as long as the game is played and loved there. The 288 was noticeable as it eclipsed Tip Fosters previous Ashes record, though it was not until the second day that Bradman went past Andy Sandhams score of 325 against West Indies earlier that year. When at last he was caught off the bowling of Maurice Tate he had amassed 334 in 383 minutes and 448 balls. Though that was a record for less than three years  Wally Hammond smashing 336 against New Zealand in early 1936  only Brian Lara (twice) has made bigger scores against England. And, indeed, it was the pace of the innings that had taken the English breath away. It would be the start of a love affair between Bradman and Headingley. He returned in 1934 to score 304 and in four matches (and only six innings) at the ground he scored four hundreds, 963 runs in total and averaged 192.60. Only at the MCG did he score more centuries. Though plenty of players have thrived on particular home pitches  Lara at the Rec, Jacques Kallis at Newlands, Mahela Jayawardene at Colombos Sinhalese Sports Club, for example  there can be few who have found such a welcoming 22 yards on foreign soil. More immediately it could only help Australia to a draw and a rain-affected match at Old Trafford also ended with no result. It was 1-1 entering the final Test at The Oval. England scored 405 in their first innings but were still beaten by an innings and 39 runs thanks in no small part to Bradmans 232, his third double-century in seven innings in the series.
While Bradmans own recollections, even at the end of the tour, tended to focus on events outside the game (the beauty of the countryside, our meeting with His Majesty King George V and Queen Mary at Sandringham; my talk with the Prince of Wales at The Oval; Harold Williams singing in Hiawatha at the Royal Albert Hall), his batting had left England a pale, shaking shell.
It is not too much to say that he took England and the whole cricket world by storm, wrote Wisden. Those who had seen him play in Australia were fully prepared for something out of the common but little would we dream that his progress would be of such a triumphal nature. The Ashes were back in Australian hands and they had Bradmans bat to help keep them there.
England were going to have to come up with something rather drastic  - theguardian

England face huge session as Smith nears century
PERTH, Friday - England's Jonny Bairstow said Friday the tourists were facing a huge session as Australian captain Steve Smith threatened to seize control of the crucial third Ashes Test in Perth by completing a fighting century.
At stumps on the second day Australia were 203 for three with the in-form Smith unbeaten on 92, leaving England's hopes of retaining the Ashes precariously poised.
Australia, who lead the series 2-0 and can regain the Ashes with victory at the WACA Ground, trail by 200 runs with seven wickets in hand after dismissing England for 403.
Heavy rain is forecast for the final two days. Wicketkeeper-batsman Bairstow, who notched his fourth Test century in making 119, said the match was evenly balanced and conceded Smith's wicket was key, but believed England had a perfect chance to take control when play resumes on the third day.
We have the capabilities of taking five or six wickets in a session, we have shown that previously and there is no reason we can't now, he said.
Our boys have got the skills to get 20 wickets in this Test match.
Tomorrow when we come to bowl in the morning is a huge session for us.
We need to try and keep the Aussies behind us for as long as possible, if we can nip some wickets and get the bowlers in and our guys are still fresh ... and we've got the new ball as well.
Promoted to bat at six, Bairstow was beaming after the day's play as he reflected on an extremely emotional century.
It came after a testing period including the bizarre head-butting incident at a Perth bar involving Australian batsman Cameron Bancroft, and a war of words with the host team on and off the field.
The hundred in many ways was my favourite one, it meant a huge amount, he said.
I have played in a few Ashes series now -- to score an Ashes hundred is something you dream about as a kid.
It has eluded me until now and it was a whole heap of emotions that came running through.
The 28-year-old played down his century celebration, which including knocking the helmet against his head several times, and said it was completely spontaneous and a bit of a light-hearted fun.
Bairstow and Dawid Malan, who notched his maiden Test century in making 140, set a new record fifth-wicket partnership of 237 for England against Australia.
At 368 for four the visitors seemed in total control, but the loss of Malan sparked a stunning collapse as they lost their last six wickets for just 35 runs before lunch.
