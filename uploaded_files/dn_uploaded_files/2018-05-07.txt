Sri Lanka provides worlds best health service
The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier mentioned Cuba having the world's best health service, but it says now Sri Lanka having the world's best, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
The Health Minister was addressing the gathering at a ceremony in Polonnaruwa recently.
The Sri Lankan health sector showed a significant advancement after 2015 and enjoyed international recognition. The former Health Minister, President Maithripala Sirisena contributed immensely to reach the coveted place, the Minister said.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that today Sri Lanka offers free health services for the poor unlike in the past when the Rajapaksas were at the helm.
A WHO report in 2017 shows that the political leadership of Sri Lanka has directly contributed towards the advancement of its health service. The WHO, UNICEF and WB has confirmed that Sri Lanka's health service, especially the primary healthcare, is at the top, he said.

UNP will be the most powerful political force
Newly appointed leaders of the UNP stressed and promised a change of course for the party as they asked their supporters to once again turn the party into the most powerful political force in the country.
The UNP May Day celebrations this year under the theme, Infusing new energy into a mature leadership at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium yesterday had nine speakers including UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, who assured that change in the next 18 months would come and that next time around it would only be a UNP government under a UNP leader.
The speakers identified; dealing with corruption, serving justice to UNPers who were politically victimized, providing jobs, granting the fertilizer subsidy, Samurdhi, uniforms to schoolchildren and a party which needs to connect and reach the grassroots as the key areas they needed to focus on if the UNP were to retain power.
In unison they appealed to their supporters to band together for the sake of the party and not yield to personal agendas. UNP Trade Union Secretary Ajith P. Perera said the government had kept to their promise of bringing the crooked to book, but many cases over the last three years had not borne fruit due to the inadequacies of the justice system, We will resolve this issue by bringing in the High Courts which will hear cases daily, he said.
We will punish both old as well as new crooks (even under our own government), Perera promised.
Our leader is not a crook and he does not protect them but we now have to struggle to clean the image of our party. We will do this in the next few months, he said. Minister Sarath Fonseka, who concurred Pereras sentiment, added that legal action against the Rajapaksa family will need to be taken in the next 18 months if they are all to avoid getting into trouble once again. He also asked that the Samurdhi be restructured and provincial schools developed further to win the support of the people. We need grassroots policies, he said.
Party National Organsier Naveen Dissanayake said the UNP was at an important juncture and could not move forward without restructuring,
We had 40 percent of the vote base to cruise on auto pilot. At the last election, it dropped to 29 percent. We need to ask why we failed. The SLPP is stronger than us today, he said.
As he appealed to the party to stick together as one team without differences in opinion, he asked that the leaders go to the people and give them what they want.
Politics is the art of the possible. I am happy to hear our leader speaks of jobs now. We need to give jobs; that is the culture in Sri Lanka, he said.
Concurring with the rest that the party needed to field their own candidate at the next Presidential election, he said, Since 94, the UNP has not elected a President. I suggest that next time the party leader or the best candidate from the party come forward; We cant depend on anyone else, he added.
Harin Fernando, the partys Communications Secretary, who also appealed for unity within the party added that unity did not mean saying yes all the time, We will fight when it is needed and protect the party when needed. This party is based on its supporters. The SLPP revolved around Mahinda Rajapaksa, and today because of Maithripala Sirisena. But the UNP will always be there regardless of Ranil Wickremesinghe.
As he appreciated Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshes presence at the May Day rally, he noted that the party was bigger than its leadership and that their leader had built it on the strength of its people.
We have prepared a new programme to move forward. Dont wait for titles to work for the party, he said.
He noted that when they build the party, new leaders would emerge through its strength.
UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, a UNPer who had risen through the ranks since his first entry to the party through its youth wing Yowun Peramuna, said despite people questioning his ability to deliver, he would commit himself completely to the victory of the party,
I have taken over the party at a difficult time and our supporters have complaints against us. That is because we dont have a government of our own. We can do more if we have, he said.

20th amendment will make SL democratic - JVP
The 20th amendment to the Constitution would be brought to make the country democratic by shedding its immoral and undemocratic features, said Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Propaganda Secretary and Parliamentarian Vijitha Herath yesterday.
He further said this objective could be achieved by abolishing the dictatorial executive presidency which was a pledge made by all the elected presidents prior to their election.
MP Herath went on to say that although most of the people criticise this move by the JVP for lack of knowledge, some others who lost power criticise the same vehemently as their hunger for power would not be able to be quenched in future.
He made these observations during a press conference held at the auditorium of the JVP headquarters.
MP Herath further said that some of the Venerable Theras too had been misled and had criticised the 20th amendment. He added after the 20th amendment to the Constitution, the President would be elected from Parliament, not like a candidate who is elected by the peoples vote. Some of the Presidents powers would be vested in the Cabinet, while some would remain with the President himself. Following the passing of the amendment, the existing President would not be a nominal President, but would remain the same until January 08, 2020, as the 20th amendment would be implemented then.
We suggest that Parliament should be dissolved on January 08, 2020, Herath said. Then a new Parliament, a new Cabinet and a new President could be elected under this fresh system. The new President should be elected from within Parliament within a month of the general election. Till then the existing President would remain in the same position.
Herath also said that nobody need worry about national security, since the President himself is the Commander of the Tri Forces. He wouldnt be a minister or the head of the Cabinet. However, the President could present Cabinet papers and also inquire about Cabinet decisions. Some fear that there would be a possibility of dividing the country with the 20th amendment to the Constitution, Herath said. But we assure the Buddhist clergy that we would not allow that.
He also said that the land powers and police powers of the President would remain unchanged with the 20th amendment to the Constitution. The President could reverse a declaration of a separate state by someone as the then President reversed Vardharajah Perumals resolution.
The sovereignty that is guaranteed by the Constitution would not be changed with the 20th amendment.
Herath added that Presidents power of appointing commissioners and ambassadors should be changed to appoint them with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers since the image of the country has been damaged in the past as thieves, corrupt people and relatives had been appointed to those positions in the past. He also added that the Presidents power of pardon should be transferred to the Cabinet. Herath said that the JVP could not be influenced by the NGOs as many people alleged and requested the Buddhist clergy and other religious dignitaries to join them to make the country democratic and moral.
JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti was also present at the occasion.

Bellew beats Haye again in British heavyweight grudge match
LONDON, Saturday - Tony Bellew appeared to have all but ended David Hayes career with a fifth-round stoppage win over his rival British heavyweight in their grudge re-match in London on Saturday.
The pair had become as well-known for their pre-match dust-ups and verbal taunts as their boxing but there was no denying the comprehensive manner of Bellews second successive victory over the 37-year-old Haye.
Tony boxed a great fight, Haye told Sky Box Office. He did some really clever stuff. He boxed really good. I didnt, plain and simple. He had a great game plan and I had no answer.
You have to let your fists do the talking, it didnt go my way even though Im fully healthy. Im taking nothing away from.
An emotional Bellew said: David Haye is an amazing fighter, he just got caught in a slugfest. Hes a great fighter, he has got crazy power but speed and power always decreases. He is a legend, a credit to the sport and Im just happy Ive got the win against the odds.
Bellew was only a light-heavyweight when Haye was at the peak of his career as the World Boxing Association heavyweight champion.
Haye had billed this non-title bout as the make or break contest of a fading career, having been stopped by Bellew, two years younger at 35, in the 11th round after suffering an Achilles injury when the pair met in March last year.
But Saturdays bout at Londons O2 Arena rarely looked like lasting as long.
In the third round, Bellew twice sent Haye to the canvas thanks to a pair of powerful right-hand punches. The bell saved Haye from further punishment that round and he tried to regroup in the fourth.  AFP

Century-maker Shafiq leads Pakistan run-spree
LONDON, Sunday - Asad Shafiq made a hundred as several Pakistan batsmen spent valuable time in the middle on Saturday ahead of Test matches against Ireland and England. At stumps on the second day of four, Pakistan were 357 for seven in reply to Northamptonshire's first innings 259 in their warm-up match at Wantage Road. Shafiq was 135 not out, with Haris Sohail having made 79 and Babar Azam 57.
Pakistan provide the opposition when Ireland make their Test debut in a match starting in Malahide, near Dublin, on Friday and they then return across the Irish Sea for a two-Test series against England.
Two days of their tour opener against Kent were lost to bad weather without a ball bowled but conditions have so far proved kinder in Northampton where Shafiq, dropped twice, made his 20th first-class century and shared with Sohail a third-wicket stand of 136.
Sohail was in good touch but fell trying to hit off-spinner Rob Keogh against the turn when he got a leading edge and was caught at point.

THE RIDDLE OF AFTERLIFE
One Niel Perera has inquired whether those who claim to be Christians, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists go their separate ways after death. The Christians believe in God guiding or steering their destinies. So are the Muslims. Buddhists and Hindus believe in Karma which also guides and steers their destinies based on how they had lived in previous births. Therefore, does not God, Allah and Karma perform the same task in guiding us in this life If so, all of us, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus tread the same path, though identified separately in this world, to reach the so called Heaven or Nirvana
If only this is understood, there would be inter-religious harmony, instead of competing religious doctrines shattering our world into separate religious communities. These divisions have become a continuous source of human conflicts.

A dear soul ransomed for a social wake-up call
A government workers little girl paid her last goodbyes last Saturday, leaving an eternal hole in the hearts of her loved ones.
Freshly covered books, still glossy pens and pencils, ready to be used for the first time at the beginning of the school year compelled this 11-year-old girl to clutch her teeth and go to school in spite of the fever with which she was contaminated.
The little girls school Principal, Easha Speldewinde, from Ladies College, Colombo, recalling her enthusiasm to come to school said, She loved to come to school.
Furthermore, relating the event which took place when her school teachers realized her condition, the Principal said, She had body ache, but she hadnt told anybody. On the second day when she came to school she had high fever and I ordered her to be sent back home. This was the end of what happened.
Where did she get contaminated with dengue
Human as we are, our judgmental eyes swiftly turned towards the school. In order to unravel answers to these questions, we further inquired of the Ladies College Principal.
She affirmed to us that the girl had come to school after returning from a vacation with her family. Easha Speldewinde added that all efforts were made by the school authorities to ensure that school premises were dengue free.
She said, The Municipality comes and fogs and we too spray classrooms with citronella.
Even today officers from the Municipal Council came and inspected the premises, she said expressing her gratitude to the inspectors for their vigilance.
We have a log entry stating that there is no dengue breeding ground in our school premises, the Principle added.
Confirming the claims made by the Principal, revoking the idea that the deceased girl could have been contaminated by the fever due to schools shortcomings, Chief Medical Officer of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Dr. Ruwan Wijayamuni said, She was residing in the suburbs and not in the CMC.
Therefore it is quite certain that she had contracted dengue from outside CMC, may be from her home or somewhere else she visited. He said that the dengue situation in the CMC is very much under control compared to the situation last year.
Fortunately, there are no dengue deaths reported from the CMC during the past 15 days of this year, he said.
Current statistics of dengue in Sri Lanka
Senior Consultant and Community Physician of the National Dengue Control Unit, Dr Preshila Samaraweera said that the dengue situation is very much under control this year when compared to the previous year.
The death of the 11-year-old girl is the first reported due to dengue during past 15 days of this year. Unfortunately dengue cannot be brought to zero in Sri Lanka.
Dengue statistics from previous years
The Epidemiology Unit sources said that last year, 427 dengue patients died while a total of 185,688 dengue patients were reported from all parts of the country. Western Province reported the highest number of dengue cases, which adds up to 76,661, last year alone.
This year only 1,302 dengue patients and one death have been reported. Only 431 dengue patients have been reported from the Western Province this year, the Epidemiology Unit sources said. The highest number of dengue patients (34,274) was reported from the Colombo district last year and this year it is only 241.
The second highest number of dengue patients (31,637) were reported from Gampaha district last year and this year it is only 148.
The third highest number of dengue patients (14,378) was reported from the Kandy district last year and this year the third highest number of dengue patients (149) has been reported from the Puttalam distict, they said.
Last year, the total number of dengue patient reported from the CMC was 5,750 and at the beginning of this year, 96 cases have been reported. Last year, a total of 28,524 dengue patients had been reported from other areas of the Colombo district and this year it is only 145.
How to take precautions against dengue
The Epidemiology Unit consultants said that people can protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing long sleeves/fully covered dresses during daytime, applying mosquito repellents (the mosquito repellent should be applied on the skin and application repeated after few hours.
The most popular mosquito repellent is citronella oil. It can be applied by mixing with 50 percent of coconut oil or something similar in order to reduce its mild burning sensation. Adults can apply both natural and artificial mosquito repellents. Mosquito repellents are not suitable for children below the age of two.
Natural mosquito repellents should be used for children between two and five years. Mosquito nets should be used while sleeping both day and night.
Screens should be fitted on windows and doors of houses to prevent entry of mosquitoes; bedrooms, kitchen and toilets should be well-lit, ventilated and airy to prevent adult female mosquitoes hiding inside houses,Be vigilant
Health Ministry and the Epidemiology Unit say
All who suffer from any type of fever for more than two days should seek immediate medical treatment from a state hospital or a qualified doctor without delay or applying home remedies. They need full rest. They should not attend work or school.
Full Blood Count should be tested in 48 hours and even when the result is normal, the test should be repeated after 24 hours. Patients with fever should be vigilant even when the fever goes down in a day or two. They must do the blood tests even after the fever goes down.
Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) such as Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Diclofenac, etc., should not be taken. All patients with fever should take Paracetamol only. Other medications cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF).
The symptoms of DHF are severe pain in the stomach, vomiting, bleeding from gums, nose, vagina, etc, red patches on the skin, coldness in hands and legs, less or no urination, paleness, sleepiness, uneasiness, feeling faint, dizziness, etc. Immediate hospitalization required for the patients.
In addition to the medical precautions, it is our social obligation to be vigilant at all times for possible dengue mosquito breeding sites and destroy and clean them on a regular basis in order to prevent breeding of dengue mosquitoes.
Whatever said and done, the little angel was taken ransom by the deadly disease. She shook our hearts, which were still merry with celebrations and reminded that dengue is still waiting to snatch its next victim.
Her voice resounds in the air saying be vigilant, take precaution and may my sacrifice be a wake-up call to you.

Entitlement to equality
Human Rights epitomise a complex, interactive, dialectical and yet unfortunately volatile relationship between people and their states. Human rights have taken a central importance in politics both inside and outside Sri Lanka. They demarcate the boundaries between the citizens and the civil society on the one hand, and the state and the political authorities on the other. The protection and promotion of human rights are considered to be important for peace, democracy and development throughout the world. From the perspective of history, human rights is a successor term to natural rights but there is a distinction between the two.
International Law
The adoption of the United Nations Charter in 1945 marked the beginning of a new stage in international law regulation of economic, social and cultural rights. (ESC Rights). The UN Charter states that one of the primary goals of the United Nations is the higher standard of living, full employment and conditions of economic and social progress and development. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted in 1948 contains an extended and specific list of ESC rights.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Article 22 provides that everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organisation and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality. The Declaration recognizes that everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work. The Declaration also recognizes the right of all workers to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests and their right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay.
Article 6 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights expressly recognized livelihood or the right to earn a living, in the following manner 
1. The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right to work, which includes the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his living by work which he freely chooses or accepts, and will take appropriate steps to safeguard this right.
2. The steps to be taken by a State Party to the present Covenant to achieve the full realization of this right shall include technical and vocational guidance and training programmes, policies and techniques to achieve steady economic, social and cultural development and full and productive employment under conditions safeguarding fundamental political and economic freedoms to the individual.
The Covenant also recognized the right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work which ensure, in particular, the remuneration which provides all workers, as a minimum, with:
(a) Fair wages and equal remuneration for work of equal value without distinction of any kind, in particular women being guaranteed conditions of work not inferior to those enjoyed by men, with equal pay for equal work;
(b) A decent living for themselves and their families in accordance with the provisions of the present Covenant.
The Covenant also guaranteed safe and healthy working conditions, equal opportunity for everyone to be promoted in his employment to an appropriate higher level, subject to no considerations other than those of seniority and competence, as well as rest, leisure and reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay, as well as remuneration for public holidays. States Parties to the Covenant also undertook to ensure the right of everyone to form trade unions and join the trade union of his choice, subject only to the rules of the organization concerned, for the promotion and protection of these economic and social interests. The Covenant expressly provided that No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
ILO approach
The ILO approach to the practical implementation of human rights is based on three guiding concepts: laying down standards by way of Conventions and Recommendations, promotional and education activities, inquiring into complains and practical assistance in involving in applying policy standards and procedures. The ILO has promoted freedom of association, collective bargaining, equality of treatment at work and the abolition of forced and child labour as fundamental principles and rights at work over the period of time since its inception. In recent years, with globalization and open markets and the threat to workers right, the international community has felt the need to reaffirm the fundamental and universal character of these principles and rights embodied in the core-conventions, to ensure social justice uplifting and protecting livelihood and a fairer society. The ILO stress that good governance of workplaces is essential to the promotion of sustainable economic development.
Indian Constitution
Article 21 of the Indian Constitution guarantees that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. This right is available to the citizens as well as non-citizens. Its ambit was widened by the Indian Supreme Court to say that the procedure established by law had to be just fair and reasonable.
In Maneka Gandhi v Union of India, the Indian Supreme Court held that the right to live is not merely confined to physical existence but it includes within its ambit the right to live with human dignity. Elaborating this view in Francis Coralie v Union Territory of Delhi the Court said that the right to live is not restricted to mere animal existence. The Court further held that non-payment of minimum wages to the workers amounted to the denial of their right to live with basic human dignity and violated Article 21.
In the case popularly known as the Pavement Dwellers case, the Indian Supreme Court observed that the word life in Article 21 included the right to livelihood. It said that if the right to livelihood was not treated as part of the constitutional right to life, the easiest way of depriving a person of his right to life would be to deprive him of his means of livelihood. Therefore, right to livelihood is an integral facet of the right to life.
It is useful to note here that the phrase the right to life has been given a wide interpretation in many jurisdictions. The first document of constitutional importance in which there is a reference to the right to life is the American Declaration of Independence, 1776. The 5th Amendment to the US Constitution (1791) consolidates this position.

FIFA proposes mini-World Cup every 2 years
FIFA president Gianni Infantino has proposed having a mini-World Cup, known as the Final 8.
* The tournament would be the climax of a global Nations League competition every two years
* The Final 8 tournament would take place every October and/or November of every odd year starting from 2021
The mini-World Cup will replace the existing Confederations Cup, which is held every four years.
Football is the worlds most loved game and with the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia almost upon us, FIFA president Gianni Infantino has proposed staging what would effectively be a mini-World Cup, featuring eight international teams, every two years in addition to the traditional competition.
The tournament, known as the Final 8, would be the climax of a global Nations League competition, which is part of an ambitious plan to reform international football which FIFA believes could be worth $25 billion in a 12-year cycle.
In a letter Infantino suggested that the new tournament would take place every October and/or November of every odd year starting from 2021.
He said that a solid and serious group of investors were willing to spend $25 billion on the competition and a revamped version of the Club World Cup, which would also start in 2021 with 24 teams.
The Confederations Cup, currently staged every four years in a year before the World Cup, would be abolished. The letter did not clearly indicate how many slots would be allocated to each region. The plans were sent by Infantino to the members of FIFAs decision-making Council which still has to approve them.
European soccer body UEFA and its counterpart for North and Central America and the Caribbean, CONCACAF, have already set up Nations League contests in their own continents.
In both cases, the competitions involve all the national teams in their respective regions who are divided into divisions based on their rankings.
There is promotion and relegation between the divisions, as in conventional domestic club leagues. UEFAs inaugural competition will begin in September this year.
Other continents would have to set up similar competitions for the tournament to be viable. - Indiatoday

Football unites in wishing Ferguson well after emergency brain surgery
MANCHESTER, Saturday - Messages of support poured in for Alex Ferguson after the legendary former Manchester United manager was left fighting for his life following emergency surgery for a brain haemorrhage on Saturday.
News of his operation was made public by his old club, with a United statement cautiously optimistic about the prospects for the 76-year-old, the most successful manager in British football history.
Sir Alex Ferguson has undergone emergency surgery today for a brain haemorrhage, the statement said.
The procedure has gone very well but he needs a period of intensive care to optimise his recovery. His family request privacy in this matter. According to the Daily Mail, an ambulance was called to the Scot's home in Cheadle, near Manchester, in northwest England at 9:00 am local time (0800 GMT) on Saturday Concerns for Ferguson's health started to mount when it was announced his son, Darren, the manager of English third tier club Doncaster, would miss his side's League One match against Wigan on Saturday because of family reasons.
It is tragic. I am going to find out how he is as soon as I possibly can, said Everton manager Sam Allardyce, a longstanding friend of Ferguson's, after his side's 1-1 Premier League draw at home to Southampton. Obviously I knew it was extremely serious when I knew his son Darren didn't attend his own game at Doncaster today, the former England boss added. - AFP

Group of 16 must accept MRs leadership: Prasanna
The group of 16, who resigned from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), must accept Mahinda Rajapaksas leadership or they will end up being another group that safeguards the government from opposition ranks like the JVP and the TNA do, Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga said.
He was addressing a meeting at Galle on May 5.
Ranatunga said the 16 member group should work with the Pohottuwa Party under the leadership of Mahinda if they really had a backbone.
Ranatunga said they were opposed the 16 member group joining their ranks.
Everyone in the JO including Ramesh and Mohan opposed them, he said.
There is a group supporting Mahinda Rajapaksa with dedication from the day he faced defeat at the elections, Prasanna said.
You all need not get upset even if the 16 member group joined us, because you are the people who had the right to vote at an election. I ask you to ensure the defeat of the 16 member group by voting against them even if Mahinda Rajapaksa canvassed supporting to them.
You ought to remind Mahinda Rajapaksa that they were the people who betrayed him last time being his bosom friends.
Ranatunga said that even though Mahinda Rjapaksa advised him not to attack the 16 members as his intention was to spoil the governments two third majority, he agreed to it on the spur of the moment, but the very next moment he criticised and attacked them because that was his nature.
Ranatunga said that as the JVP was bringing in the 20th amendment to the constitution to suppress the other burning problems in the country and make people forget them. Today no one was talking about the Central Bank Bond issue, he said.
Recently, certain top officials attached to the President were caught in the bribery net.
He said the Pohottuwa decided Galle should be its venue for the May Day Rally since the government refused to give them the Galle Face Green.
The government had changed Vesak Poya and May Day. This could have been the real change it had promised, Ranatunga said.

Higgins sets sights on fifth world snooker title
LONDON, Sunday : John Higgins powered into the World Championship final on Saturday and immediately set his sights on joining snookers all-time greats.
Higgins has won the world title four times and will make his seventh appearance in the sports showpiece match after defeating Kyren Wilson 17-13.
The Scot is just one title behind Ronnie OSullivans haul of five and Higgins admitted it would be a great feeling to emulate his old rival.
Of course it would, it would be amazing. Hes the best player ever in my eyes and if I got to the same amount of world titles it would be an amazing feeling, Higgins said.
Only Stephen Hendry and Steve Davis have lifted the trophy more times at Sheffields Crucible theatre than OSullivan.
Higgins will face Mark Williams in the two-day final, which starts on Sunday, after the Welshman, himself a two-time former world champion, overcame Barry Hawkins 17-15 in a tense last-four clash.
Hell be going for a third one, Ill be going for a fifth, said Higgins. Hes bald and Im grey so itll be a mental final.
Higgins first won the world title in 1998, and has twice lost in the final in 2001 against OSullivan and last year against Mark Selby.
Asked if he sees himself as the favourite to take this years title, the 42-year-old said: No. I know its going to be another mammoth final. Itll be a great match Im sure.
I keep using the word proud. Im proud 20 years later, after I won my first one, that Im sitting here ready to compete in another one. Its a fantastic feeling.
Higgins was 10-4 ahead against Selby yet lost in their second world final meeting 12 months ago.
Determined to make amends, he said: I felt that was probably my best ever chance to win it (for a fifth time).
It might still be my best ever chance. I dont know how the next games going to transpire.
Williams appearance in the final is the latest stage in a remarkable late-career revival. He did not even qualify in 2017, and last reached the final 15 years ago, when he defeated Ken Doherty.
He nearly retired last year and did not win a ranking title for six years, but Williams has already won two tournaments this season.  AFP

Japans Nakajima leads foreign dominance
Third and final stage of the Sri Lanka T-Cup Cycle Tour 2018 ended on a grand scale at Negombo with Japans Kinan Cycling Team member Yasuharu Nakajima winning the overall championship. The two runners up behind him were Kazakhstans Vino-Astana Motors cyclist Stepan Astafayev and Japans Ukyo team member Yoshimitsu Hiratsuka.
Yesterdays the final leg of the tour began on schedule at 9.05 a.m. from Kandy and the first bunch of nearly 25 riders finished the race opposite the Negombo Municipal Council clocking 2hrs 44.36 secs. Though all riders were in a bunch to receive the flag it was Mohamed Hanif Saleh of Malaysia who crossed the line first and declared the winner. Though Saleh was able to win this stage he was not able to finish among the top ten in the previous two stages which was a real surprise.
The two riders who did well in the previous stages Stepan Astafyev and Yoshimitsu Hiratsuka finished runners up in yesterdays event. When the cyclist started off from Kandy they were all in a bunch for nearly 30 kilometers before they broke off from the bunch and got in front by another 20 kilometers. The riders who were following the leaders never gave up the chase and battled well not to allow the leaders to increase their lead. The second bunch of cyclists were only a minute and 30 seconds away from the front runners. They held on to this distance for more than 40 kilometers
Cyclists reaching Pannala on the Kurunegala stretch saw the next break away when a few more riders fell behind. This gave more opportunity for the second bunch of riders to pedal faster and help catch up with the front line riders. On catching up with the leaders they rode extremely well to maintain a high speed. All were together until the finish line to receive the chequered flag from the Mayor of Negombo Municipal Council Dayan Lansa.
Two foreign riders crashed while attempting to go ahead just 50 meters away from the finish line. One rider had to be rushed to hospital as he had suffered severe injury to his hand.
The only Sri Lankan rider to excel in the final leg was Ramesh Viran Appuhamy who was placed 25th in Negombo. Ramesh was representing the Sri Lanka National Cycling team at the Sri Lanka T-Cup Cycle Tour 2018. Except for Ramesh none of the other nine Lankan riders were able to improve on their timings in all three stages. Sri Lankas two teams each comprising five riders represented the national team and presidents team. In the last leg the best three Lankans were Ramesh Viran, Hemantha Janaka Kumara and Madushanka Prabath Silva.
Nicholas White of Australia who displayed great skill in mountaineering was awarded the Mountain Prime Award, while the Best Overall Sprinters award went to Kazakhstans Stepan Astafyev who represented Vino Astana Motors Club. Frenchman Julian Amadori who represented the France Defence team received the Best Climbers Award and the red dot jersey.
According to the points gained from the third stage yesterday Kinan Cycling team was in front but could not get the overall team Championship as Kazakhstan Astana team had the better timing from the three stags and carried away the team title.

LONDON, Saturday - Nottinghamshire took control on day two of their English County Championship game against Hampshire at Trent Bridge on Saturday.
Hampshire resumed their first innings on 70-3, trailing by 232, and despite half centuries from Hashim Amla who made 69 and Lewis McManus 66, no other batsman reached 30 as they were all out for 223.
Notts openers Steven Mullaney (82 not out) and Jake Libby (50 not out) made an unbeaten 136 to help their side to lead by 215 runs at stumps.
Harry Brook's maiden first-class century and Steven Patterson's 4-21 gave Yorkshire hope of victory over Essex on day two at Chelmsford. Resuming on 161-2, teenager Brook was eventually out for 124 as Joe Root (35) and a valuable 29 from Jack Leaning helped Yorkshire to 329 all out.
Essex, chasing 238 to win, started well before Patterson removed Alastair Cook (26) and Tom Westley in the 10th over. Nick Browne and Ravi Bopara also departed before Essex closed on 97-4.
Keaton Jennings finished unbeaten on 91 for Lancashire as the hosts replied well to Somerset's 429 on day two.
Jennings, who has played six Tests for England, batted patiently in a 169-run stand with Dane Vilas (83 not out) to turn around his poor early-season form. Lancashire closed on 217-2, still trailing by 212 runs on first innings.
Earlier, Somerset captain Tom Abell fell for a fine 99 as the visitors moved from 321-5 overnight, with Jimmy Anderson (0-91) going wicketless.
Surrey skipper Rory Burns made the highest Championship score of the season so far to help his side pile up 434 against Worcestershire at The Oval.
Burns went for 193, falling fell just short of what would have been the second double century of his career. But the visitors, who have lost their first three matches, did not buckle.
Ex-captain Daryl Mitchell got the reply off to a solid start with an unbeaten 77 to help his side close on 135-1, needing 150 more to avoid a follow-on. Durham's early-season struggles continued as Leicestershire's fast bowlers induced a top-order collapse. Leicestershire extended their overnight score from 301-4 to 440, with Mark Cosgrove (75) and Neil Dexter (70 not out) doing the bulk of the scoring. Ben Raine (3-29), Varun Aaron (1-54) and Gavin Griffiths (3-26) then combined to leave Durham 51-6. Graham Clark (50 not out) and James Weighell (29) put on 61 runs together as Durham reached stumps on 142-7.
Jeetan Patel and Henry Brookes took all 10 Derbyshire second-innings wickets between them to bowl Warwickshire within reach of a second Championship Division Two win of the season. Having shared eight wickets in the first innings, Patel took 6-76 and Brookes returned figures of 4-56 as the visitors were bowled out for 209. Warwickshire who had reached 439 in their first innings, were set 89 to win.
Harry Finch's century helped Sussex recover and take charge against Middlesex on day two of their Championship game at Hove. The hosts resumed fell to 127-6, but Finch's 103 helped them post 323 in reply to Middlesex's 230. Ollie Robinson added 52 from 57 balls, while Michael Burgess scored 45 in a 74-run eighth wicket stand with Finch.
Middlesex slumped to 9-2, but Dawid Malan's unbeaten 34 helped them to 64-2 at stumps, trailing by 29 runs. Glamorgan hold a precarious 193-run lead over Kent, closing on 273-9 in their second innings on day two of their County Championship Division Two game at Sophia Gardens.
The key moment was the run-out of Shaun Marsh, whose classy 76 saw him add 126 with Jack Murphy (54). Earlier Glamorgan seamer Timm van der Gugten finished with a first-class career-best of 7-42 County Championship (second day of four)

Revisiting 1915
lessons from a violent past
The recent mob attacks against Muslim families and property in Kandy is another sad chapter in Sri Lankas history of ethnic violence.
Now, many are re-examining the past, looking for reasons for why this ugly strain of communalism will not subside, and for ways to fight it for the future.
Because before Digana in March, and before Aluthgama in 2014, there was 1915.
In May of that year, following a fight outside a mosque in Kandy during the Vesak perahera, mobs killed 25 people, raped four, and injured 189 in a wave of anti-Muslim violence that spread across the island.
The British colonial government declared martial law, and its army and police killed at least 63 people in the crackdown. There are records of English volunteers, like planters and businessmen, openly shooting people with the tacit consent of the state.
By the time the rioting stopped, more than 4,000 Muslim shops had been looted and 17 mosques burned over a period of nine days.
The riots of this year and those of 1915 are separated by more than a century. But historians argue that critically examining history can reveal valuable lessons for the present.
A fight over noise
How was it that a small local scuffle during a perahera exploded into island-wide rioting
Multiple scholars of Sri Lankan history have focused on a factor that at first glance seems unrelated: the British regulation of noise in colonial Ceylon.
The British government ordered new restrictions on noise in 1865. The police ordinance of that year forbade the beating of drums at any time, within any town, without a licence by the state, said Shamara Wettimuny, Head of the Politics Team at Verit Research, in a recent lecture.
Under the regulations, noise from religious processions also had to be stopped within 100 yards of any place of worship. Those who violated the rules could be fined or imprisoned.
Though the regulations were not written to target a specific religious community, through court rulings and restrictions on peraheras, Sinhala Buddhists came to regard the regulation of noise worship as a British tool of discrimination, Wettimuny said.
She pointed to a case from 1895, when the municipal court in Colombo charged the chief monk of a Buddhist temple for allowing the beating of drums without a licence. The drums are common and integral to many Buddhist rituals.
In the following judgement, the chief justice said, The idea must not be entertained that a noise, which is an annoyance to the neighbourhood, is protected if it is made in the course of a religious ceremony, Wettimuny recounted.
So in British Ceylon, peraheras and noise worship became politically charged activities. Wettimuny said that this sense of discrimination and the feeling that their culture was under threat, helped solidify an already emerging Sinhala Buddhist ethno-religious nationalism.
The British regulation of religious rights was perceived as antagonistic towards Sinhala Buddhist culture, she said.
Shamara Wettimuny
Other scholars have pointed to the noise issue as well.
This ordinance created a new space for conflict between religious communities that until then had not systematically considered drumming a disturbance, wrote Nira Wickramasinghe in her book Sri Lanka in the Modern Age.
Even before the 1915 riots, fights between religious communities over this ordinance were brewing.
Local Muslims in the town of Gampola, for instance, appealed to the colonial authorities to stop Buddhist processions from passing their mosques. The Supreme Court ultimately sided with the Muslims.
These tensions created a hostility that was simmering for years, according to the anthropologist S.J. Tambiah.
In his book Leveling Crowds, he quotes from Sinhala Bauddhaya, the paper run by Anagarika Dharmapala.
From the day the foreign white man stepped in this country, the industries, habits and customs of the Sinhalese began to disappear and now the Sinhalese are obliged to fall at the feet of the Coast Moors and Tamils, it read in 1912.
The riots
In May 1915, these tensions exploded. The Vesak perahera of that year fell on May 28. While local Buddhists were planning for the annual procession, police ordered them to divert it away from the Castle Hill Street mosque.
This decision to shield the mosque from Buddhist noise worship was viewed by Sinhala Buddhists as minorities receiving preferential treatment from the state, Wettimuny said.
The organisers agreed to the diversion, but fighting still broke out as the procession passed the mosque.
Police could not contain the violence, and the authorities ordered police and military reinforcements from Colombo.
The mob violence continued, and three days later, perhaps aided by the vacuum left by law enforcement officers who went to Kandy, rioting broke out in Colombo. It also spread into the communities around Kandy, and large swathes of the Southern and Western Provinces.
In all, five of Ceylons nine provinces saw anti-Muslim rioting.
Noise was certainly a major faultline contributing to the initial violence in Kandy. But other historians point to other compounding factors as well.
Feminist scholar Kumari Jayawardene cites the rising prices of commodities during World War I, and argues that many Sinhalese accused Muslims of exploiting the situation by raising prices locally.
She relays the account of a mob near the Maradana railyard in Colombo attacking a nearby tea shop, apparently over the increase in the price of a cup of tea.
Both Jayawardene and Tambiah also note how the violence seemed to follow the rail lines, as they facilitated the fast dissemination of information, especially rumours.
And rumours were rampant. A few, according to Tambiah, were that Muslims were planning to destroy the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy, that the colonial government wanted Muslims expelled from the country, and that Muslims were raping Sinhalese women.
Riots erupted across the island for nine days before the British government regained control through the brutal exertion of martial law.
Wettimuny argued that more scrutiny needs to be directed to the British government, and how they were culpable in fostering the conditions that led to ethnic conflict in the first place.
The riots are a case in how seemingly benign laws can have devastating repercussions when they are applied without sensitivity to existing faultlines in divided societies, she said.
Lessons for today
Certain aspects of the 1915 riots echo in todays context.
The role of rumour stands out especially. Its widely reported that the anti-Muslim violence in Ampara started with the rumour that a Muslim-owned hotel put sterilization pills into a Sinhalese customers food.
Myths also swirled before and during the rioting that broke out around Kandy, such as that a fatal fight stemming from a traffic incident was actually part of a large-scale Muslim plot to wipe out the Sinhalese.
In the new age of social media, weve moved from the speed of truck or (night mail) train to spread rumour, including in July 1983, to the speed of light, said Sanjana Hattotuwa, who studies hate speech and social media for the Centre for Policy Alternatives.
This means that violence can spread and hop geography, he added.
The colonial governments response to the 1915 rioting was martial law and deadly suppression by law enforcement.
The current government, when it became clear that local law enforcement could or would not contain the mob violence, shut down social media altogether as a way to stop the flow of rumour.
Hattotuwa argued that clumsy responses to the symptoms of ethnic division are not a long-term solution to an ugly phenomenon that wont recede.
It is vital to address underlying causes of violence, more than the ways in which the hate is spread, he said.
The government and civil society should instead foster a greater narrative that asks (people) to be part of something new and forward looking, instead of being hostage to a past and (its) attendant insecurities, he added.
Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim politicians famously came together to oppose British colonialism and win independence.
Seventy years have passed independence; that solidarity needs to be rediscovered.

May Day rallies across Sri Lanka today

Several political parties and trade unions will today celebrate International Workers Day, marking the occasion with rallies and processions in towns across the country after the government decided to postpone the countrys May Day celebrations to May 7 due to the Vesak Week.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Partys (SLFP) May Day rally themed Promoting Reconciliation and Inter-Communal Harmony will be held at Chenkalady, Batticaloa today under the auspices of SLFP Leader President Maithripala Sirisena.
According to party Vice President, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, the SLFP rally this year would be the initial step of uniting all factions of the party holding dissenting views and heralding a new era for the SLFP.
The Minister said the 16 SLFP MPs who recently quit the Government have also pledged to participate in the rally.
Meanwhile the May Day rally of the Joint Opposition (JO) will take place in the Southern province as their rally will be held at the Samanala grounds in Galle today, led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa with the participation of all other constituent parties.
The JO says the rally will be used as a platform to protest against the Governments moves to sell national resources, rising inflation and political victimisation.
Meanwhile, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) will hold its second May Day rally for the year in Colombo today.
The party had earlier held a rally on May 1 in Jaffna in defiance of the governments decision to postpone International Workers Day celebrations.
The May Day procession of the party will commence, led by its party leaders, from Campbell Park at 1.00 p.m. going on to gather at the BRC ground for its rally.
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) will also be holding a May Day rally which will commence from the Colombo Public Library at 9.00 a.m. today.
Its party members will gather at the Colombo New Town Hall where Anagarika Dharmapala and Trade unionist E.A. Gunasinghe will be commemorated.
The United National Party (UNP) held its May Day rally yesterday morning at the Sugathadasa indoor stadium under the patronage of its leader, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The rally was held on the theme New life for a matured leadership with the attendance of UNP Ministers, parliamentarians and party members. The party did not be hold a May Day procession this year.

May Day should highlight unequal economic growth: Sajith
May Day this year should highlight the unequal economic growth in the country, UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa said yesterday as he touched on the growing income equality in the country.
No matter what people say about economic growth, today 54 percent of the countrys wealth is shared among 20 percent of the richest, whilst the 20 percent of the poorest in the country only get 4 percent of the wealth, he added addressing UNPers gathered at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium to celebrate government declared May Day yesterday.
Premadasa insisted that economic growth should be felt both in the wallet and stomach of the common man for it to have an impact.
He said people gave them an important mandate in 2015, and we have to work to strengthen that trust further.
As a government, we have no right to tell people to wait a bit more or have patience as today we wield the state machinery. I ask the Prime Minister to simply show the green light, and we will embark on a historic development plan which will be felt by the common man, Premadasa said.
He said the mandate given to the government was to embark on clean politics to protect the common man and to strengthen him. Looking to the UNP crowd, Premadasa said he was no longer prepared to betray their supporters, those who would bleed green for the party.
Having been in opposition for the past 20 years, people now want to speak to us, notice us, because of you. It is time for the rulers to respect the people.
The Deputy Leader noted that many speakers had expressed their views openly and honestly and though the Prime Minister had said that he had managed through difficult times, the word of the hour should be relief, growth, jobs, and benefits to the common man.
I believe my party leader will deliver on that, he said.
He said the Prime Minister had appointed a committee headed by him to look into development projects which can be fast tracked for the benefit of the people. Premadasa said they would act, so that the people could see for themselves the real situation of many of the projects,
We now only have 18 months left, we have to do or die in this period, he explained, stressing, We need to reform, we need to be creative and deliver to the people if we are to stay in power for the next 20 years.
Highlighting some of his committees recommendations, he said they had asked that fertiliser be given free to the people, school uniforms be given under the earlier system and to have two sets of uniforms and a pair of shoes added to it, to provide Rs. 300 million each to every MP so that they can undertake development work in their respective areas, to solve the issues of all UNPers who have suffered political victimisation (the number is estimated at 36,000), to appoint at least two UNPers to the government service at every Grama Sevaka division, repair lakes and canals and improve farmer livelihoods.
Responding to a request made by Minister Sarath Fonseka to build houses for low income groups in Kelaniya, the Housing and Construction Minister noted that his hands were tied as he only ran one sixth of the housing ministry started by his father.
Ranasinghe Premadasas ministry was split into six parts and given to various other ministries from hill country to fisheries. If they are given to me I will deliver,he said.
We have suffered enough; in future we need our own government. It was at the Sugathadasa that Ranasinghe Premadasa was chosen as the next UNP Presidential candidate. He was nominated and seconded by Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake, he remarked as he asked that for 2020, the party follow suit and bring in one million members to the Galle Face Green to elect their next Presidential candidate, he said.
But first we have to win the Provincial council elections, then only we can talk of the Presidential, Premadasa said.
He appealed to all to unite under the new team with a common purpose and prepare for the provincial council elections.
I promise you that I will protect the party and Sajith Premadasa will bow his head to any unanimous decision made by the party, he said.
My father too protected the party and its leadership, and was steadfast in his journey. Despite the hurdles put before him and the disappointments he faced under JRs leadership, he stood by JR as his second in command. He never betrayed the party; I will follow him, he said.
I would like to say that if the demand of our party supporters are not met, God bless us all, he said.
Premadasa said that he had full faith in the Prime Minister to deliver.

President promises stern action against bribery and corruption
The government will take firm steps to wipe out bribery and corruption in all sectors, including the public service without any hesitation, President Maithripala Sirisena emphasised.
He said the law will be implemented to the letter against bribery and corruption without concern for any persons standing or status.
The President made his pledge addressing the gathering at the International Family Health Services Day celebrations at the Polonnaruwa Rajakeeya Madya Maha Vidyalaya premises on May 5.
The President said politicians and public servants should never work in a manner that will make them earn the scorn and abhorrence of the people.
The public service should be free of corruption if we were to build a righteous society, the President said.
The President recalled that both during the time he served as a Minister and functioned as President for the last three years, he had taken stern decisions to prevent corruption, robbery, fraud, waste and misuse of public property without any difference. As much as the work of the Presidential Commission probing the Central Bank Bond case were carried out properly the Presidential Commissions probing alleged fraud and corruption at SriLankan Airlines would divulge vital information to the country in the future, the President added.
The President who expressed his appreciation of the Health service which had earned international renown and being free of corruption, said he would every possible sacrifice to further strengthen it and Family Health Service Association Chairperson Devika Kodituwakku in a prenation of their services.
Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne also presented a special award to President Sirisena in appreciation of the mission rendered by him for the progress of the Health service. NCP Governor M.P. Jayasinghe was among other distinguished guests present on the occasion.

Putin set to be inaugurated for fourth term as president of Russia

Vladimir Putin is due to be sworn in for a fourth term as president of Russia on Monday after winning the election in March.
He has been in power for 18 years, whether as President or Prime Minister, and opponents have likened his tenure to the reign of a tsar, or emperor.
Riot police confronted protesters against his rule in Moscow and other Russian cities on Saturday.
There have been fears of new unrest on Monday as he takes office.
The inauguration at the Kremlin in Moscow is likely to be lower-key than in 2012, AFP news agency reports.
Putin is only expected to meet volunteers who took part in his election campaign, the agency says.
Why were there protests
More than 1,000 arrests are said to have been made in 19 cities across Russia on Saturday, nearly half of them in Moscow.
Putin was re-elected president with more than 76% of the vote, his best ever election performance, but widespread irregularities were reported by some international observers. Allegations of ballot-rigging had dogged previous elections too.
The country's best-known opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, was barred from standing against Mr Putin, on grounds of a conviction for embezzlement which he denies and alleges was politically motivated.
Navalny was arrested briefly as he tried to join Saturday's unauthorised protest rally in Moscow under the slogan "He's not our tsar".
Domestic opponents accuse Mr Putin of undermining democracy in Russia - a policy dubbed "managed democracy" - to keep genuine opposition parties out of parliament and ensure that he and his allies retain power indefinitely.
Could Putin just go on and on
First elected president in 2000, Putin renewed his four-year term in 2004 before stepping aside in 2008 to serve as prime minister under his protege, Dmitry Medvedev, because by law he could only serve two consecutive terms.
Few doubted who was really in charge and in 2012 Putin returned as president, this time for a term of six years.
If and when he reaches the end of his fourth term in 2024, the 65-year-old will have been in power for nearly a quarter of a century.
That would still fall short of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's 31 years in power or, indeed, the reigns of some Russian tsars such as Alexander II (26 years) and Nicholas I (30 years).
1952:Born 7 October in Leningrad (now St Petersburg), Russia's second city, studies law and joins KGB secret police, serving as spy in communist East Germany
1990s:After serving as top aide to mayor of St Petersburg, enters Boris Yeltsin's Kremlin in 1997, where he is made chief of the FSB (the KGB's successor)
1999:Appointed prime minister, becomes acting president upon Yeltsin's resignation
2000:Elected president and serves two four-year terms
2008:Barred from running for a third consecutive term, stuns analysts by returning to post of prime minister while his protege Dmitry Medvedev becomes president
2012:Re-elected president and for term of six years, under new law
2018:Re-elected for fourth term
How has Russia changed under Putin
Ordinary Russians welcomed the stability associated with Putin's early years in office when inflation was reined in and basic state functions like the welfare system were shored up.
Separatist violence in the North Caucasus which had plagued the administration of Putin's predecessor, the late Boris Yeltsin, was finally brought to a bloody end.
As prosperity grew, fuelled by oil and gas revenue, Putin oversaw an increase in state power, rolling back independent media as well as political freedoms.
His decision to annex Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 sparked one of the biggest international crises since the Cold War, incurring Western sanctions which continue to this day.
Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 US presidential election soured international relations even further, while this year saw Putin accused by the UK of responsibility for a nerve agent attack on its soil - allegations denied by Moscow.
Political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin told AFP Mr Putin's approach to the international community would have to change over his new term.
"Russia hasn't been so isolated since the Soviet war in Afghanistan," he said.
"Now his [Putin's] task isn't to bring any new lands to Russia but to force the world to consider Russia's interests and accept its previous conquests," Oreshkin added.

Former Senior Press Officer to the President reminisces
Ranasinghe Premadasa: Character of charisma
President Ranasinghe Premadasa first entered politics as a commoner. However, his intelligence and leadership qualities soon propelled him to the echelons in 1989. His former Senior Press Officer, Dr Nimal Senaratne, knew the late President well.
President Premadasa was a man who led a good family life. However after becoming the Prime Minister and then the President, since he zealously loved his country, much of his attention was directed at governing the country and he concentrated on his presidential duties. That is the impression I had of him, and this is natural as it is with any statesman.

Dr. Nimal Senaratne. Picture by Sarath Peiris
President Premadasa was devoted to his people and the affairs of the state. However, he intensely disliked it when his family and relatives trying to influence him when it came to the administration of the country. That is something he was very much against, said Senaratne.
The Gam Udawa programme was instrumental in boosting the development process.
When you build houses, you build the village. When you build houses, you build roads for the village. When you build houses, you create electricity and the water supply. The village gets a community hall. The village receives a health centre. Through the building of houses, the basic needs are addressed. That was Gam Udawa. When someone has a roof and four walls, he or she can live. This really brought the country forward. It was definitely successful. They can even grow their own crops in their garden, stated Senaratne.
Senaratne recalls the compassionate traits in the former President. He knew how the common man toiled. He knew this because he himself had modest means.
This is why he started his Jana Saviya programme promoting the export of garments. He told businessmen to open garment factories, telling them that he would find orders from abroad. He gave bank loans and started the opening of garment factories in rural areas. Through that, he provided jobs to those who had little or no income. The President felt that they should not be dependent on the government. It was done across the island. And true to his promise, he got orders from abroad. Garments were exported in large volumes to America in addition to other countries. This is another feature of his government. He showed kindness to those who needed kindness, noted Senaratne.
Comprehensive knowledge of society
President Premadasa syringed a new lease of life to the rural art by establishing the Gramodaya Folk Art Centre. He drew inspiration for such a centre during a visit he made to Thailand.
The Centre offers much relief to village-based entrepreneurs. Their products are exported. The staff, trained on the job, collect the products from across the island and unearth the relevant export market. This helps the economic development of the country. The market is both local and foreign  arts and crafts, added Senaratne.
President Premadasa could not be fooled into anything. He was a tough personality to hoodwink as the late President knew the ways of men only too well. He had a comprehensive knowledge of society. His understanding of men was a key factor in his incredible accomplishment as a leader.
After the 1987 Nagoya Habitat Conference, returning home to Sri Lanka, he spent some leisure time with his team in Hong Kong. At that time the former SLBC Chairman Hudson Samarasinghe was present. While having his meals, he addressed Samarasinghe and simply said  Hudson no one can outsmart me. I know the nature of men and I know how the world works. I have associated with many people and cannot be misled by anyone, recalled Senaratne.
He was not a man who went to university but he understood the common man. He was a man of the people. He became the first citizen and knew how to get the job done by delegating tasks to men and women who were capable of achieving his vision.
He also had the invaluable assistance of his secretary Bradman Weerakoon, a capable, distinguished and accomplished man who served six Prime Ministers as secretary. He also had the assistance of K H J Wijayadasa, a resourceful man who served as his secretary after Weerakoon when he was Prime Minister. Subsequently, he became the Secretary to the President.
He immediately identified those who had the ability to get the job done. Wijayadasa brought about a very balanced leadership. In the presidents inner circle the danger is that he can be misinformed. However Premadasa was intelligent, and he together with Wijayadasa sorted matters out. He nipped the problem in the bud before it got out of control. Wijayadasa was a competent secretary. Premadasa also knew whom to depend on during his presidency. That was a very important feature of his tenure as President, said Senaratne.
However, President Premadasa had a tough job dealing with the insurgency in the South and the LTTE problem in the North and he took certain decisions independently which did not have favourable results during peace talks.
When President Premadasa came to power he was beset with difficulties with the insurgency in the South and the LTTE in the North. It was a job not many would have taken. But he faced his difficulties well with confidence and intelligence. The economy was falling apart due to the severity of the problems. The fact that President Premadasa faced these problems is a feature of his outstanding leadership. He faced these problems methodically and shrewdly. The conduct of international relations during his presidency was handled mainly by Bradman Weerakoon and K H J Wijayadasa under his direction, explained Senaratne.
President Premadasa understood that the country had to be developed at the grassroots level and he wanted to start from the very bottom and move upwards. His insights into the common man helped him a lot here.
Newspaper cuttings
Premadasa as Prime Minister was awarded Sri Lankas highest award to a civilian, Sri Lankabhimanya in 1986 by President J R Jayewardene who saw his potential. Even though President Premadasa had never gone to international universities he understood the needs of the common man. He understood the pulse of the people.
During his tenure as Prime Minister, one practice of Premadasa was that he reviewed the newspaper cuttings like a prayer every morning at 5 am. Here he updated himself with the happenings in the country. He expected the newspaper cuttings to be presented to him and he would learn of the various problems the people of Sri Lanka were facing. These cuttings detailed the shortcomings in the country and woes of people. He then contacted the heads of departments and asked them to immediately attend to these problems. He was tough when it came to those matters. He brought the country to a certain level, explained Senaratne.
When it came to economic matters, understanding the importance of transport, he developed the roads and highways.
This is essential as people need to get to work. He understood that jobs were important and provided them. He did it from the grassroots level. As President and Prime Minister, he attended to the basic needs but had little time. Owing to the problems with the LTTE, what he could do was limited. And again because of the problems in the North and South the exports of tea and rubber had fallen. Industries suffered and exports weakened. He even invited the JVP to join his leadership and asked them to work for the country, said Senaratne.
Due to the intervention of third parties who had their own agenda, the relations between President Premadasa and Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Athulathmudali became estranged. As a result, there was a rift between the President and these two illustrious politicians. Lalith Athulathmudali was a friend of former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew who once told J R Jayewardene that he had better ask Athulathmudali for advice without asking him when President Jayewardene sought advice from Yew.
So an impeachment motion was brought against President Premadasa due to the influence of these third parties. President Premadasa and these two great politicians could have worked together for the country. Premadasa faced the situation without fear. Never was his charisma more evident. He was able to win over the MPs who supported the motion bringing them to his side. Without these problems, he could have transformed this country, pointed out Senaratne.
Prime Minister Premadasa was against the IPKF (Indian Peace Keeping Force) in Sri Lanka. He showed his opposition by not attending the signing of the Peace Accord by President Jayewardene and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Even Lalith Athulathmudali did not attend. Athulathmudali and Premadasa were of one mind.
When he became President, Premadasa took a lot of effort to get rid of the IPKF. If he did not do what he did to get rid of the IPKF there would have been more problems in addition to the insurgency in the south and the LTTE threat. He understood the omens were not good. And fortunately, he succeeded in his efforts, summed up Senaratne.
Senaratne also stated that the former President was also sensitive to journalists and showed due respect to the media. The President was ably supported in this regard by late Evans Cooray his Press Secretary.

Risk reduction in agriculture
At the time of writing this piece, there is a hot weather advisory for several provinces whilst rain in prevalent in others due to atmospheric conditions. It obviously impacts on the environment in particular in the growing of food. The piece today touches on several aspects.
In addition to disasters faced by different segments of society such as farmers and fisherman, from a gender perspective 1.2 million out of 5.2 million families are headed by women. DRR and mitigation need to be gendered. Furthermore, agricultures footprint has caused the loss of whole ecosystems around the globe. Agriculture is among the greatest contributors to global warming, emitting more greenhouse gases than all our cars, trucks, trains, and aeroplanes combined. Coupled with it is pressure to produce food in the future. Our conversation should hence become broader in scope and coverage
Why gender in DRR
Disasters affect men and women differently, but more on women. Few governments considered gender perspectives in their national reports on DRR -Gender issues have not yet been integrated into DRR. Both DRR and gender are cross-cutting developmental issues, which need to be addressed through a holistic approach and concerted actions in political, technical, social, developmental and humanitarian processes.
Challenges before Indian agriculture
An opinion by MS Swaminathan is carried here.
There are two major challenges before Indian agriculture today: ecological and economical. The conservation of our basic agricultural assets such as land, water, and biodiversity is a major challenge.
How to make agriculture sustainable is the challenge. Increasing productivity in perpetuity without ecological harm is the need of the hour. In Punjab, and in the other Green Revolution States, the water table has gone down and become saline. Further, during the Green Revolution the population was about 400-500 million; now it is 1,300 million and it is predicted to be 1.5 billion by 2030. The growing population pressure has made it pertinent to increase crop yield.
Evergreen Revolution concept
Increase in farm productivity but without ecological harm. This will include integrated pest management, integrated nutrient supply, and scientific water management to avoid the kind of environmental damage witnessed during the Green Revolution. Mandatory rainwater harvesting and the introduction of fodder and grain legumes as rotation crops to be adopted by wheat farmers in States like Punjab to ensure sustainability of farming.
Declare fertile zones capable of sustaining two to three crops as Special Agricultural Zones, and provide unique facilities to farmers here to ensure food security. Soil health managers should be appointed to monitor and ameliorate the soil conditions in degraded zones and rectify defects like salinity, alkalinity, water logging, etc.
The Prime Minister recently went to Israel. They have a clear sense of where water is needed and where its not. The idea of more crops per drop has been implemented well in Israel.
You should see how a water controller works on an Israeli farm. Everything is remote-controlled. They know exactly which portion of the field requires how much water and release only the exact amount. Post-harvest technologies like threshing, storage, etc. will have to be given greater attention now.
Can GM technology help address food security challenges
There are many methods of plant breeding, of which molecular breeding is one. Genetic modification has both advantages and disadvantages. One has to measure the risks and benefits before arriving at a conclusion. First, an efficient regulatory mechanism for GM in India. We need an all-India coordinated research project on GMOs with a bio-safety coordinator.
We need to devise a way to get the technologys benefit without its associated risks. At MSSRF (M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation), we used GM technology with mangroves to create salt-tolerant varieties of rice. For this, we took the genes from the mangroves and inserted them it into rice. To make the most of GM technology we must choose a problem where there is no other way to address the challenge.
The cycle of droughts and floods, this has rendered farming risky
Both less rainfall and a higher mean temperature affect farming adversely. Currently, we are witnessing drought, excess rainfall, sea-level rise There are both adaptation and mitigation measures to follow in this regard.
Ive evolved a drought code and a flood code... some of the recommendations Ive made in recent times include setting up a multi-disciplinary monsoon management centre in each drought-affected district, to provide timely information to rural families on the methods of mitigating the effects of drought, and maximising the benefits of good growing conditions whenever the season is normal.
Animal husbandry camps could be set up to make arrangements for saving cattle and other farm animals because usually, animals tend to be neglected during such crises. Special provisions could also be made to enable women to manage household food security under conditions of agrarian distress.
In the case of temperature rise, wheat yield could become a gamble. We should start breeding varieties characterised by high per day productivity than just per crop productivity. These will be able to provide higher yields in a shorter duration.
Impact of heat waves on plant cells
Dr. Ranil Senanayake has been writing and warning on the dangers of excessive heat on plant cells. He goes onto say, Why is a heat wave so dangerous Apart from the heat stress in human and animals, it could exceed the threshold for enzymatic activity. All of the agriculture depends on the good growth of plants, all plants rely on their chlorophyll to grow and produce. Chlorophyll is a molecule that functions to an optimum at about 37 degrees, above that their performance falls. In heat waves often exceeding 38 degrees plant productivity will be impacted and yields drop. This year much of Australia dealt with a brutal spring heat wave that reduced farmers yields. Should we not prepare ourselves Is this not disaster preparedness But does Climate Change and Disaster Management and Meteorology Department discuss these threats, in a joint manner
This article shows several facets related to agriculture and the impact of climate change. The M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation has always promoted smart ideas which are shown here. Similarly, Dr. Ranil Senanayake has argued for integrated approaches to address some of the pressing contemporary challenges faced by us.
Its imperative we pay attention.

Significance of May Day
The working masses in Sri Lanka will celebrate May Day (Labour Day) today. It was shifted from the traditional May Day (May 1) as it fell during the Vesak week. This move was not without its fair share of controversy and some parties and trade unions chose to have their rallies on May 1 itself. Some, like the JVP have chosen to hold rallies on both days in different parts of the country. What really matters is not the day per se, but the increased recognition of the workers struggle for better working conditions.
This years May Day has seen political parties moving out of Colombo and reaching out to workers in other parts of the country. The JVP, for example, successfully held a rally in Jaffna which brought workers from the North and South together. The UPFA will hold its rally in Batticaloa. This is an encouraging trend.
Workers in Sri Lanka have been celebrating May Day for many decades. Over the years, May Day has been transformed into a political event based loosely on the significance of the day for the working class. It has become an opportunity for the political parties to show their grassroots strength and also their affinity to the working masses.
It is in fact very hard to separate the labour movement from politics. The workers in many organisations are represented by trade unions which are for the most part affiliated to major political parties. Sri Lanka has a vibrant trade union sector, especially in the one-million strong government workforce. There also are a number of powerful professionals trade unions which are essentially non-political. But they do have immense clout, mainly because the services they render are essential to the public.
Sri Lankas trade unions have a predilection for demanding higher salaries for their workforce, regardless of the economic situation of the country. Trade unions should stop the current practice of resorting to strikes at the drop of a hat if their demands are not met. That should be a last resort, to be considered only when negotiations with the authorities fail. They should stop taking the public hostage when they strike to win their demands. Unfortunately, this is what happens when medical professionals and workers, road transport/rail/port workers and employees in several other fields strike. If doctors at government hospitals are on strike, where can the poor patients go
But do workers and trade unions pause to think of their obligations to their organisations and to the public This rarely happens. Employer-employee relations are very important in this respect. All employers, government or private, must respect labour laws and rights. A smooth relationship between the two sides  often called industrial peace  is necessary for the smooth functioning of any organisation.
Another important aspect of work that both employers and employees often neglect is safety at work. Many jobs come laden with occupational hazards but most employers often do not equip their workers with the required safety information and gear. Apart from occupational hazards per se, some workplaces do not have adequate structural and fire safety. Ventilation and sanitary facilities are also inadequate in some workplaces. Regulations governing such facilities should be introduced without delay.
Another irritant is that there still is a disparity between the salary scales of male and female workers in some sectors. This should not be the case. Women workers, especially in labour-intensive jobs, are generally known to be more productive. Equal work, equal salaries should be the guideline.
Yet another negative point is that most Sri Lankan workplaces are not disabled-friendly. Most organisations which claim to be equal opportunity employers are reluctant to welcome disabled employees to their ranks. There obviously are certain jobs that a disabled person will not be able to do but there are many that they can do, without any problem. For example, no one expects a visually impaired person to be able to drive a bus, but he or she can easily become a telephone operator with some training. This is another aspect that labour authorities must look into.
They should study International Labour Organisation (ILO) guidelines as well as labour regulations in other countries in this regard. In fact, Sri Lanka has been working closely with the ILO for several decades. Sri Lanka has signed many Labour Conventions and Charters which had helped workers around the country. This fruitful relationship should continue for the betterment of the working class.
Those who are employed, be it in the Government, private or even in self-employment sectors must bear one thing in mind: they have a job. On the other hand, there are thousands who do not have a job at all. This is one more reason why the employed must be determined to do an honest job, literally.
Sri Lankas unemployment rate is very low, but it would be beneficial to the economy if more jobs can be created here and abroad for the unemployed youth. This must be a priority for the labour, agriculture, industries and foreign employment ministries. Zero unemployment should be the ultimate target.

Stoke relegated as West Bromwich Houdini act continues
LONDON, Saturday - Stoke Citys 10-year stay in the Premier League ended on Saturday following a 2-1 home defeat by Crystal Palace in a dramatic penultimate round of matches.
Yet never-say-die West Bromwich Albion kept their hopes alive of pulling off one of the great escapes with a last-gasp 1-0 win over top-four aristocrats Tottenham Hotspur.
West Brom took their wholly unlikely unbeaten run under caretaker manager Darren Moore to five matches with a stoppage-time winner from Jake Livermore.
Then the Baggies enjoyed yet another incredible reprieve when a Southampton victory at Everton in the late game, which would have confirmed their relegation, was prevented by a 96th minute equaliser for the home side in a 1-1 draw.
Though Southampton were left fuming that the goal had been scored after the allotted four minutes of added time, the point still moved the Saints out of the drop zone on goal difference ahead of Swansea City, who lost 1-0 at Bournemouth.
It leaves the battle for survival in the final week even more fascinating, with Swansea hosting Southampton in a critical match on Tuesday.
West Brom jumped on to 31 points, leapfrogging doomed Stoke on 30, with both sides having one game left in the final week while Southampton and Swansea are both on 33 with two games left.
At the other end of the table, Tottenhams defeat left them fourth on 71 points and gave Chelsea new hope that they might steal the fourth Champions league spot if they can move onto 69 points by beating Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.
Burnley fans were left celebrating too as Evertons draw ensured the seventh-placed Clarets will be playing in the Europa League next season, the first time they have been in European competition since the 1966-67 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. The day began with Stokes faint hopes were briefly revived in the early kickoff as Xherdan Shaqiris deflected free kick just before halftime put them ahead against Palace.
Yet Roy Hodgsons resurgent side, dominant after the break as Stoke were gripped by nervy caution, equalised after a sharp counter-attack through James McArthur before a Ryan Shawcross mistake let in Patrick van Aanholt for the 86th-minute winner.
Despite overseeing a 13-match winless streak, Stokes worst run in a top-tier season for 34 years, manager Paul Lambert saluted the effort of his players.
This club has to bounce right back up, he said. The club is too big not to. It will regroup and its got the right infra-structure in place to do it. Albions revival is beggaring belief, even if their chances of the most miraculous survival are still minimal.
Their relegation after weeks of defying the prophets of doom seemed assured as the game against Spurs went into added time but Livermore forced the ball over the line from close range in a manic finish.
Less than three hours later, it seemed their heroics could be all in vain as Nathan Redmonds header for Southampton at Goodison put the Saints, who later had Maya Yoshida sent off, in sight of the three points that would condemn Albion.

Twin coal mine collapses in Pakistan
PAKISTAN: Twenty-three people were killed and 11 wounded after gas explosions tore through two neighbouring coal mines in southwestern Pakistan, officials said on Sunday.
Shortly before midday on Saturday, a build-up of methane caused an explosion and tunnel collapse at a mine in Marwaarh, east of Quetta, the capital of the fossil fuel-rich Balochistan province bordering Iran and Afghanistan.
Jawaid Shahwani, the top government official in Quetta, said 16 of the 25 people inside the mine at the time were killed, with the remaining miners rescued and taken to hospital for treatment.
Around three hours later, a mine 25 kilometres (16 miles) to the west at Spin Carez collapsed in similar circumstances, killing seven of the nine miners inside.
Provincial mines minister Saleh Baloch told AFP that all miners in both accidents had been accounted for and rescue operations had ended.
Pakistani mines are notorious for poor safety standards and bad ventilation.
A total of 43 workers died in 2011 when gas explosions triggered a collapse in another Balochistan colliery, also owned by the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation.
Balochistan is the largest of Pakistan's four provinces by area but its roughly seven million people have long argued they do not get a fair share of its vast gas and mineral wealth.
The beleaguered province has also battled against separatist insurgents and Islamist militants for more than a decade. - AFP
The injured were taken to hospitals in Quetta.

Unbeaten Justify wins Kentucky Derby despite record rain
WASHINGTON, Sunday - Undefeated Justify won the 144th Kentucky Derby on Saturday, ignoring the wettest conditions in race history to become the first Derby champion since 1882 who didnt race as a two-year-old.
Trainer Bob Baffert won the Derby for the fifth time, one shy of the record owned by 1940s legendary trainer Ben Jones, while jockey Mike Smith captured his second victory in the 1 1/4-mile classic at Louisvilles Churchill Downs.
It took a great horse to do what he did today, Baffert said. I rank him up there with my top ones. We knew we had something special.
Favored Justify, who went off at 5-2 odds, unleashed the third-fastest half-mile pace in Derby history and went on to win in 2mins 4.20 secs with Good Magic second by 2 1/2 lengths, edging third-place Audible at the line.  AFP

UNP will rule for next 20-30 years, promises PM
A UNP which will rule for the next 20-30 years and not just five, was the promise UNP Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe made to his supporters as the party commemorated May Day at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium yesterday.
Last week the UNP had taken over the Ministry of Social Empowerment and the Prime Minister who had promised quick action noted that they would bring in the Samurdhi Bank under the control of the Finance Ministry and Central Bank to avoid rampant corruption in the system.
Yesterday, I looked into the Samurdhi, the previous minister had spent 52 percent of the allocation in three months. He was allocated Rs 25 billion for one year!
A Samurdhi that would be apolitical and operated under the District Secretariat was thus promised in future.
Similar to government action to resolve the trifecta; Fertiliser, Samurdhi and Jobs which they believed had led to their losses at the last Local Government election, the Prime Minister also informed his supporters that the long awaited party reforms would take place,
On the 70th anniversary of the Party, I promised to create new leadership within the party. I have done that,said the leader to a jubilant crowd as he referred to the new appointments to the UNP leadership.
J.R.created three leaders to take over after him, but, we lost all of them. I have the spare wheel, the third wheel in the three-wheeler,the Premier said. In 1994 when I took over, people said the party would die off after me.
We had not only lost our leaders but many of you lost your family members over the years, killed because they worked for the party, the Prime Minister said.
Thus his vision of an unbroken UNP government he said could only be achieved by building the second tier of leadership, More new officers would be appointed soon. I cant take it forward forever, he said.
A complete restructuring of the party was promised in the partys journey to achieve long term power.
All of you here now have to work as a team. If you can work as a team, the UNP can last for the next 20 years. The responsibility to bring victory to the party, I hand over to each one of you. I want to create a small Sirikotha in every village. I have laid the foundation now get ready to run, stressed the UNP leader.
The Prime Minister noted that since taking over power, the government had steered a difficult path to overcome the debt trap it had been put in by the previous regime. Whilst also winning over the international community, he said they had spent time encouraging investments, establishing the rule of the law and laying the necessary foundation for future growth.
The drought, floods and even the collapse of the garbage dump affected us. But we did not let the economy fail despite the setbacks, we can now repay all our loans in 2018-2019, the Prime Minister added. However, admitting that they have failed to fulfil the aspirations of their supporters, the Prime Minister reiterated that the government would provide employment to graduates and train unskilled workers so that they can find employment in the private sector.
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is not a party.We have to see why we lost the last Local Government Elections. We have come through even worse defeats, in 2015 no one thought we would win.
The UNP today is the only party which can provide the country with stability, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
