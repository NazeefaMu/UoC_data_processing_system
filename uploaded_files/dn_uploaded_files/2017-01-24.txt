Hambantota fiasco should be avoided in Galle
We have seen enough in Hambantota.We also know the reasons for it.Successive governments and SLPA management did not take the advantages of allowing local and foreign investors to partake in the development in Hambantota.
It was the short sighted policies which led to the skirmish and mayhem.Finally the Navy Commander was at the receiving end.
Development of Galle is long outstanding .If you have time to go into the port ,you will note how empty it is.Partly developed Marina is hardly full with no other infrastructure.
A Yacht Repair and Leisure Craft repair and building project was mooted but got stranded due to withdrawal of the investor. Local company took over and offered to continue,but SLPA was not very supportive.
The Government and SLPA is contemplating to entrust the whole harbour to a foreign investor to convert the same into a fully fledged marina.SLPA and the State wants to move out the Navy Camp elsewhere.
Now that Hambantota has got a permanent Navy contingent ,Southern Command of the Navy based in Galle can be moved out.I am not sure what they intend to do with the Fishery Harbour.
The day they try to relocate the Fishery Harbour there will be blood shed.
Nobody will invest in a Marina with a dirty disorganised fishery harbour breathing at their neck. An Indian Company looks like eying for the Marina Project in Galle Harbour with around 50 US$million.
The SLPA is giving notice to the local investors willing to re-float the Yacht Repair Project.SLPA is of the opinion that the whole harbour in toto should be given.Another investor is offering to put up a mixed development project bordering the harbour.The Tourist Board is imposing height restrictions for the building.The Urban Development Authority is dilly dallying in granting the development permit. A Cabinet Committee of Economic Management (CCEM) is going along with SLPA and allowing the Agency for Strategic Development select nominated investor using Swiss Challenge Method.
Many do not know what the Swiss Challenge is .
If at all a new investor comes in he will ask for a 99 year lease and they have to get rid of not only the Navy but also the cement bagging and unloading operations of Holcim Cement.Supply boats currently using Galle harbour may have to follow the rules to be imposed by the new investor.
The SLPA staff will lose their jobs and they will follow suit of their Hambantota bretheren.This scenario must be avoided.

This focuses on extending the support to the chosen villages from providing drinking water to the holistic development of the communities through educational development, youth empowerment and enhanced livelihood.
The Hayleys Puritas Sathdiyawaras Going Beyond programme provided over 2,200 children from 9 schools in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mullaithivu and Vavuniya districts all the items required to start off the school year, such as uniform material, school bags, exercise books and stationary for a whole school year as per the government book list.
This particular project is an extension of scope of Hayleys Puritas Sath Diyawara, our flagship CSR initiative. Our primary purpose of this initiative is to eradicate the deadly chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) through focused, consistent and unwavering support of these villages. We are now going a step beyond this to offer holistic development and mentoring to different segments of the village so that the communities will be able to attain a more prosperous and sustainable future. The support that we extend towards these children today will hopefully translate into a positive impact on our countrys future progress. commented Mohan Pandithage, Chairman and Chief Executive, Hayleys Group.
Gamini Herath, School Principal of Nelumwewa Maha Vidyalaya, Polonnaruwa said, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Hayleys Group for supplying uniforms, stationary and the necessities to help our students secure a brighter tomorrow, and also for providing them and their families with access to clean drinking water and with that changing the quality of our lives and giving us the gift of hope.
To date Hayleys Puritas Sath Diyawara has spent over Rs 50 million rupees to build 11 Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants to provide clean drinking water to the North and North Central provinces of Sri Lanka fully sponsored by different sectors of the Hayleys Group.
In addition, the programme has set up model organic farms and provided training on effective waste management and also educated residents on turning waste into profits, thereby creating new livelihood opportunities and also empowering women. This year at least 5 more RO plants are scheduled to be declared open with a number of Hayleys Group Sectors further supporting this endeavor.

Indelible emblem of compassion
The Bodhisatva image at Dambegoda has been identified as the Bodhisatva Avalokitesvara, the most important Mahayana deity worshipped by the Buddhists in Sri Lanka when the cult of Avalokitesvara attained its zenith in the 11th century.
According to Mahayana Buddhism, Bodhisatva Avalokitsvara is the Lord of compassion and the most powerful manifestation of Amitabha the celestial Buddha presiding over the present world and he is the symbol of the universal Brotherhood and Salvation.
The Bodhisatva Avalokitesvara, functions in the role of a saviour of mankind under the auspices of the Buddha Amitabha whose effigy he bears upon his crown.
The two manuscripts written in Nepal in the 11th century, mention of the worship of Avalokitesvara as the Divine Healer which was prevalent in the 9th century in many Buddhist countries, including Sri Lanka.
Prof. Senarath Paranavitana quoting Culacmsa has linked Dambegoda with Kanagama  blindmens village, wrote: In Kanagama, Aggabodhi (607-683 A.C.) built hospitals for the blind and sick and the large image house in the Patima-vihara. The wise (prince) set- up a stone image of the Buddha (Maligavila) which he had made and which received the name of the great produced as by miracle.
This reference in the Cylavamsa to Kanagama (blindmans village) where hospitals for the blind and the sick were built has been identified as Maligawila and Dambegoda dedicated to the heavenly guardian of the sick and the infirm.
Pre-Christian times
The image at Dambegoda is surrounded by a thick jungle with tall trees of black ebony, yellow satin and ed amarind under which wild elephants roam freely.
This area can be reached by road 250 kilometres from Colombo and it is on the northern border of the Yala Wild Life Santuary. The closest village can be approached by a kilometre on a cart road.
The ancient route linking the two major capitals Anuradhapura in the north east and Tissamaharama in the south east passed by close to Dambegoda. This area dates back to pre-Christian times with its image house of the Bodhisatva has been built on the notch of the small hillock rising about 100 metres above the plain facing the north.
There are many Brahmi inscriptions belonging to pre-Christian times carved on the drip ledges of the caves which name the rock shelters used by the Buddhist monks in the past.
Both Maligavila and Dambegoda at first formed one monastery complex with residential units for monks and they are positioned between these two units. The dwelling complex of the monks was similar to the type of buildings of the Anuradhapura period with a courtyard of high walls and five residential units.
The central unit was used by the chief monk for his living and teaching. The storey above was the library. The four side storied building could each accommodate six pupils or a total group of twenty four pupil monks.
The Dematamahal Vihara of the 8th century with its Panchavasa monastery lies within eight kilometres form Dambegoda. Yudaganava with its incomplete stupa dated to the 12th century is 20 kilmetres away from Dambegoda. Buduruwegala with a group of seven colossal Mahayana statues belonging to 10 and 12th centuries. The sub-capital of Galebeda of the 12th century is within 40 kilmetres of Dambegoda to the west and east.
Religious and spiritual aspects
The Bodhisatva image at Weligama popularly known as Kustaraja reflects the beliefs in the magical healing properties of the Bodhisatva Avalokitsvara. The Kustaraga image stylistically dated to 9  10th century, the same period as that of the Dambegoda figure. But the Dambagoda Bodhisatva image from religious and spiritual aspects represent one of the noblest and impressive figures of the Bodhisatva Avalokistesvara as the Divine Healer prevailed in many countries because of his powerful knowledge holds all creatures who are beset with hundreds of troubles and afflicted by many sorrows and thereby is a saviour in the world including god.
It is also believed that this saviour through whose grace and compassion decrepitude and disease will come to an end. These beliefs of Mahayana Buddhism gained ascendance in Sri Lanka to increase the divine protection and healing powers of the hospitals for the benefit of the destitute and infirm, rather than Avalokitesvara to take over the function of the Buddha, the sublime Lord of the Sinhalese Buddhists, whereas in Cambodia, in early 13th century the cult of Avalokitesvara as the divine healer, royal hospitals were shifted from the spiritual care of the Medicinal Buddha to the supreme protection of Avalokitesvara.
The miniature Buddha on the crown of the Dambegoda statue is identified as Avalokitesvara, the Lord of compassion and the Divine Healer of Mahayana system of Buddhism.
The Dambegoda colossal figure stands on a pedestal in the posture known as Sambhanga reflecting majestic dignity, steadfastness, strength and power. Both hands are raised in the Katakahasta  a gesture symbolic of holding a flower which generally symbolizes benevolence.
This hand-pose displayed by the Bodhisatva may indicate the presence of the red lotus which meant purification and spiritual awakening.
The use of the double Katakahasta, however may have been a development of the regular iconographic formula applied to the images of Avalokitesvara in Sri Lanka.
The left hand of the image shows the Katakahasta and the right hand suggest the gesture of teaching. Avalokitesvara images displaying the double Katakahasta are fairly rare but the Buduruvegala is an exception.
The Dambegoda Bodhisatva wears rich attire and many ornaments, complete with a long Yajnopavita, the sacred thread to indicate his social status. The elaborate crown and the full set of ornaments underline the Bodhisatvas regal and divine nature.
Ancient stone carvers
The ascetic and priest-like traits of the figure form another facet of his personality. This has been reduced to the minimum by the display of stylized hair locks, barely visible among the ornaments.
There are other Avalokitesvara figures namely Kustaraja image at Weligama and a few bronzes found at Tiriyaya show this regal form.
The Avalokitesvara figure at Buduruvegala, Weligama and Tiriyaya are within the same span of time. However the Dambegoda Bodhisatva surpasses the colossal figures of Buduruvegaala and Weligama not merely by its size but more by its finely conceived proportions, its majestic pose and its sublime facial expressions.
Aesthetically too, it is the finest sculpture portraying the skill and workmanship of the ancient stone carvers in Sri Lanka.
The interest of the Dambegoda statue was roused when Boisselier visited the site in 1970. Later the Federal Republic of Germany showed an interest in a cultural project in Sri Lanka. Reider from the museum in Berlin visited the site which the Archaeological Department had already undertaken for excavation.
Thereafter it was begun as a joint venture in 1980s to conserve the 9th century Bodhisatva image and restore it to its pristine form for the centenary of the Department of Archaeology in 1990.

India denies talks are on to take over development of Trincomalee port
Indian official sources on Friday denied Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonsekas contention that Sri Lanka and India are in talks for developing the Trincomalee harbour.
Fonseka had made the claim on the sidelines of a conference in New Delhi earlier this week, touching off adverse comments in Sri Lanka on the dangers of trying to balance China and India and making Sri Lanka an arena of big power politics.
Opposition propaganda is that the government is eager to give Trincomalee harbour to India to balance the grant of 80 percent stake in Hambantota harbour to a Chinese state-owned company for 99 years.
Indian sources clarified that India is not at all interested in such balancing deals and that it is not interested in Trincomalee port as it is not going to yield an income for a long time.
In fact, India had earlier rejected an invitation to build the Hambantota port for the same reason.
Even now, Hambantota port is being maintained and its liabilities are being met with earnings from the countrys only profit making port  the Colombo port. The Colombo port will be further weakened financially, if Trincomalee and Kankesanthurai ports are added to the list of dependent non-performing ports.
Indias only interest is in seeing that any foreign presence in Sri Lanka is not a security threat to India, sources said. It does have a fear that the current deal with the Chinese company on Hambatota port could at some point be a security threat to India as the port will be in de-facto if not de-jure control of the Chinese government for the next 99 years. This was the fear behind the Indian opposition to the Rajapaksa governments decision to give land to China in the Colombo Port City on a freehold basis. Alarm bells rang in New Delhi when a Chinese nuclear submarine docked in Colombo harbour without letting India know in advance.
The Indian source, however, made it clear that India is not against Chinese development projects in Sri Lanka, no matter what they are, so long as they are not a security threat to India.
As regards development plans for the Trincomalee harbor, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has given the basic contours and India is not in the picture.
Speaking in Singapore on July 18, 2016, Wickremesinghe said that Trincomalee harbour will be turned into a modern one by the Singapore-based company, Surbana Jurong.
With 40 years experience in infrastructure development, Surbana Jurong will prepare a Master Plan for Trincomalee harbour and its environs, which will include shipping, manufacturing and tourism, he said.
An area of 175 sq km south of Trincomalee will be developed as a high end tourist resort area , he added.
Surbana Jurong was the master planner, engineering consultant and project manager for Jurong port in Singapore.
Jurong Port serves over 7,000 vessels of up to 150,000 deadweight tones every year, with 23 berths that can accommodate vessels with drafts of up to 16 meters and is equipped with super post-panamax quay cranes and gantry cranes to handle containerized cargo.

The 25-year-old Konta, Britain's last hope in the singles after Andy Murray and Dan Evans were bundled out on Sunday, took 69 minutes to send the Russian packing in temperatures approaching 35C.
Makarova was no match for Konta's serve or ground game in the first set as she changed angles and depth of returns that prevented the left-hander from getting any rhythm.
Makarova, who beat sixth seed Dominika Cibulkova in the third round, raced to a 4-1 lead in the second set but Konta rallied to win the next five games and sealed victory on her second match point when the Russian's forehand sailed over the baseline.

Learners choice
In March 2016, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that plans were afoot to change the countrys education system to suit the changing trends and new high-technology age. In September 2016, University Grants Commission Vice Chairman Professor P.S.M. Gunaratne stated that the Sri Lankan education system must change to keep pace with the modern world. A few days ago, Foreign Employment Minister, Thalatha Athukorale said that a national policy on education should be introduced as soon as possible.
Any sensible citizen will totally agree with all these sentiments. What the statements highlight is the need to produce competent people, with the right type of skills, demanded by todays industry and market.
It will not be an exaggeration to say that our education system is in complete disarray. The system is steeply politicalized. There is widespread corruption within the sector. Studies show a decline in learning levels among schoolchildren and a sharp drop in the quality of the teachers. Student drop-out rates are still high.
Curriculum is out of date. We still give prominence to rote learning, and as a result, problem solving skills and creative thinking are not promoted through our education system. We do not give due recognition to mathematics and English, the knowledge of which is essential for the development of any career. Extra tuition classes are needed to pass examinations.
Our education system is not research oriented. Due to the pressure of competition, the motto is Each for himself and therefore, teamwork is not emphasized. Adequate attention is not given to promote fine arts and performing arts in school curricula. Even when engaging in sports the emphasis is not on good sportsmanship, but on winning somehow.
Left-overs
It may also be true that undergraduate education in state universities is free. Yet, fewer than 16% of those who qualify get admission to state universities since the entrance examinations are extremely competitive. Only the top students from each district get admissions.
What happens to the balance left-overs It is estimated that 8-10 per cent go abroad to continue with their studies. They have parents who can afford the cost. Others have few options: (1) Open University of Sri Lanka, (2) State-owned autonomous degree awarding institutes, (3) External studentship of traditional universities, (4) Private institutions conducting classes and examinations on behalf of foreign universities, (5) Professional bodies who conduct examinations on behalf of both foreign accredited institutes (CIMA, ACCA etc.) or local institutes (ICASL, SLIM), (6) Vocational technical institutes that specialize in mechanical, electronic and electrical subjects.
All these openings cost money. The Constitution of Sri Lanka provides for education as a fundamental right. One might ask whether this fundamental right is truly enjoyed only by the few who gained admission to the State Universities.
Wasted talent
If education is to be the main key to a higher status of life, then the availability of education to all qualified students becomes crucial. When the channels of access to higher education become clogged at any level, then we will indeed have a rigid society, and a potentially inflammatory situation. If we are to make available, the talent of our most capable young people for the challenging years ahead - it seems imperative that we clear and broaden the channels of access to higher education for those qualified.
As things stand today - despite the clamour for more educated professionals - a vast amount of our brainpower is going waste. All estimates appear to agree that the number of bright secondary school seniors who do not go to any campus or further education because of monetary incapability runs into hundreds of thousands.
The social danger here is that parental income rather than personal ability will determine who gets an advanced education and who does not.
Major role
The Government has a major role to play in such a situation. If it cannot subsidize the cost of higher education to all qualified students, at least, a system of student loans need to be introduced. For example, student loans play a very large role in U.S. higher education. Nearly 20 million Americans attend campuses each year and close to 60% borrow annually to help cover costs.
In the USA, student loans come in several varieties, but are basically split into federal loans and private student loans. The federal loans, are subdivided into subsidized (the Government pays the interest) and unsubsidized. Federal student loans are subsidized at the undergraduate level only. A subsidized loan is by far the best kind of loan, but an unsubsidized federal student loan is far better than a private student bank loan. Student loans may be used for any campus-related expenses, including tuition, room and board, books, computers and transportation expenses.
Both subsidized and unsubsidized loans are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education either directly or through guaranty agencies. Nearly all students are eligible to receive federal loans. Both types offer a grace period of six months, which means that no payments are due until six months after graduation.
Techno change
In the last three decades, throughout the world, the educational scenario has undergone major changes. These include rights-based approach to elementary education, student entitlement, shift in emphasis from literacy and basic education to secondary, higher, technical and professional education and reshaping the higher education scenario.
These new concepts filtered down to our country as well and our professionals began to highlight them. The suggested reforms included a new impetus to skill development through vocational education in the context of the emergence of new technologies in a globalized environment, need for innovative ways of student financing, addressing challenges of globalization and liberalization and recognition of multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary nature of learning and knowledge. These have come into limelight, often discussed but practically nothing has been done so far.
Indian lesson
It is in this context, we can learn a lesson from our neighbour  India. The concern for the improvement of education had been at the top of Indias development agenda since its independence. Several commissions were appointed by the Government of India from time to time to formulate policies required to enhance access to and participation in education and improve quality of education.
The 42nd Constitutional Amendment in1976 brought about a fundamental change by transferring education from the State List to the Concurrent List. This was done to effect recognition of the importance of the political structure of India and giving equal primacy to both the central and state governments as partners in furthering the educational goals in a cohesive manner.
Since then, significant changes have taken place in the Indian education sector. The Government recently understood that the educational activities and learning process were no longer confined to the classroom and, therefore, the domain of education was no longer limited to formal schooling or higher education.
The fast pace of generation and application of new knowledge, especially in the fields of science and technology, and its impact on the daily life of people had brought into focus the importance of introducing learners to the rapidly changing world of knowledge. The need for the development of human skills, including life skills, that meet the demands of the emerging knowledge economy and society highlighted the need to promote the acquisition by learners of knowledge and skills on a life-long basis.
The Government of India realized that these developments implied that the education policies and the content and process of education must evolve with the changing times and needs. The goals, structure, content and processes of education needed renewal keeping in view the experiences gained in the past and the concerns that have emerged in the light of changing national goals and societal needs.
Thus, the National Education Policy, 2016 came into being designed to guide the renewal process in education in India.
The Indian National Education Policy, 2016 envisions a credible education system capable of ensuring inclusive quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all and producing students/graduates equipped with the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values that are required to lead a productive life. The policy covers a wide array of topics including access and participation, quality issues, skills and employability, curriculum and assessment, Information and Communication Technology (ICT), teacher development and management, equity issues, system efficiency, governance and management, research and development and budgetary constraints.
Perhaps education authorities in Sri Lanka can take their cue for the design of a new education policy from the Indian experience.
The direction of any national education policy of Sri Lanka needs to be anchored in a lifelong perspective. The policy should envisage broadening the scope of education to facilitate various pathways to learning depending on learners choice, potential and affordability and in relation with skills required for the execution of Governments long-term plan.

Legendary coach Bollettieri to uplift Lankan tennis
Turning a new chapter in Sri Lankan tennis, legendary US tennis coach Nicholas James Bollettieri who has trained 10 world number 1 players including Andre Agassi, Boris Becker, Maria Sharapova, Venus and Serena Williams, Martina Hingis, Jim Courier and Kei Nishikori has pledged his support to help uplift the standard of Sri Lanka tennis.
The 85-year-old veteran on a short visit to Sri Lanka on the invitation of Queens Club Tennis convener Asanga Seneviratne addressed the media at the Sports Ministry auditorium yesterday. Queens Club in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) conducted a three-day coaching camp for budding tennis players where Nick actively engaged in training and inspiring young Lankans.
Its not the size of the gift, but the thought behind it I value, said Nick when he was presented a memento by the Sri Lanka Tennis. Pictures by Sarath Peiris
Nick has revolutionised elite junior tennis coaching by opening the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy (NBTA) in Florida, the first major tennis boarding school. Even after International Management Group (IMG) bought the academy in 1987 Nick continued his services to the academy.
SLTA Selecting Committee chairman Arjun Fernando said that Sri Lanka is very fortunate to have the services of an elite international coach like Nick. Nick instructed our Davis Cup team and we are glad that we could include around 100 young players for this short training. But I believe in the long run, we have to focus on high performance training for our top level players by Nick if we are to raise our standard internationally. We hope to produce at least one player in the top 200 ATP rankings in the future, Fernando stated.
Despite his age, Nick was so alive and graceful in his speech and emphasized the value of team work. Its not Nick did everything alone, its me and my team. Today there are 225 full time tennis players in our academy in addition to another 800 sports men and women in nine sports, said Nick.
Coaches must know how to speak to young players. They must not let down a player in front of others, which can cause severe damage to his or her mentality and career. I have worked for three days with Lankan youngsters. I saw two seven-year players who are capable of challenging a same aged competitor from any part of the world. You need competition to raise you to the next level.
Parents and family play a vital role too. I had the opportunity to speak with Sri Lankan parents on the last two days. I hope to launch a continuous program here. I will visit Sri Lanka three or four times a year, but will have a constant follow-up through internet discussions and videos of practice sessions.
We can choose talented players for scholarships, but the results wont come overnight, it takes time. The children will lift themselves to the next level in two-three years and within five-six years they can reach international level. I can guarantee that the children will transform into another level, not just in sport but in life as a whole. Their moral values will be enhanced and they will learn how to refrain from bad habits such as alcohol. What can be done here is more than I thought, Nick explained.
When asked whether he felt that Sri Lanka was on par with international standards in practice venue conditions and materialistic requirements, Nick said, It is not the size of the desk, but who sits behind it. It depends a lot on coaches. When you put good players with good coaches the standard will rise, he noted.
Nick also said the right combination of techniques, physical ability and mind will bring out the best out of a player. Giving some useful tips to youngsters Nick said it is very important for them to have realistic goals. Take one day at a time. Secondly, how good you are you must have the feeling that you can be much better. Your family support and encouragement is the other important fact in all your success, Nick said.

Lionel Richie producing Sammy Davis Jr. biopic
Music icon Lionel Richie is producing a biopic about late entertainer Sammy Davis Jr.
The film will be based on memoir Yes I Can: The Story Of Sammy Davis, Jr., which was written by Davis, his wife Jane and Burt Boyar in 1965, reports Deadline.
Its an honour for me to bring the life of one of my idols and friends to the screen, Richie said in a statement. Im so grateful to be working closely with the Davis family on this and couldnt be happier to be moving forward on this passion project.
The biopic has been in the making for several years and rights to the film were at the centre of a legal battle in 2012. However, the executors of Davis estate, including his youngest son Manny, are now on board for the upcoming project.
I am happy to tell the whole entire world that my family and I look forward to working with everyone to educate audiences of all ages about our fathers incredible American adventure, he shared.
The movie will also be produced by Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Mike Menchel. While a screenwriter and director have yet to be attached to the project, they will have plenty of material to work with, considering Davis extraordinary career.
Davis life saw him perform in the army during WWII, become part of the Rat Pack in the 1950s alongside Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, and record a number of successful blues albums. While headlining in Vegas with his fellow Rat Pack members, he was also forced to stay and prepare offsite due to racial segregation.
Davis also nearly died in a car accident in San Bernadino, California in 1954, which cost him his left eye. During his recovery he began studying Judaism and he converted in 1961.
After reuniting with Sinatra and Martin in 1987, Davis toured with them and Liza Minnelli, before he died of throat cancer in 1990.

Monetary Board to probe EPF investments
The majority of EPF investments go into government securities; bills or bonds and the Monetary Board is conducting a study to find out whether there have been losses in their investments between 2015 and 2016, Finance Ministry Deputy Secretary S.R. Attygalle said as the Monetary Board released a statement to the press yesterday to dispel fears over losses incurred to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF). An internal examination is currently underway under the direction of the Monetary Board on transactions of EPF in Government securities during 2015 and 2016.
The law enforcement authorities have also been requested to carry out an external independent investigation into the issuance of government securities in 2015 and 2016 in related matters as it involves examining internal operations carried out by the staff of the Central Bank, stated the release adding that the Monetary Board had taken several measures during the past six months to strengthen the decision making process with respect to investments.
An officer attached to the EPF told the Daily News that they were not aware of the investigations and that the Central Bank had appointed a separate team to conduct it.
Investments are going on as usual, the official said.
In 2015, the EPF purchased Treasury Bonds from the Secondary Market at over Rs. 2.36 billion from Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL) at the face value of Rs. 2 billion.
The EPF which functions under the Central Bank, according to revelations made by the COPE report last year, could have bought bonds from the Primary Auction which would have yielded greater profits but chose not to do so.
The actions which are closely connected to the bond scam led to the organisation, Voice Against Corruption (VAC), filing legal action in the Supreme Court claiming that the EPF lost close to Rs. 10 billion because of the bond scam.
The statement comes in the wake of President Maithripala Sirisena appointing a special Presidential Commission to investigate into the Bond Scam and Parliament taking up for debate the very same issue.

MRs doosra
That the six Chief Ministers who met former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for a possible rapprochement, failed in their bid to iron out differences, may not have been a surprise to many. Rajapaksa is obviously is still smarting at being denied an opportunity at a fling at the Premiership, the grass cut from, under his feet by President Sirisena. He certainly would have been miffed at the idea of some second tier politicians, such as Chief Ministers, coming to meet him.
According to former Minister Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, who was a participant at the meeting, the Chief Ministers were not well received by Rajapaksa. The MP pointed out that any attempt to work together must be reciprocal. Rajapaksa, for his part, insisted that peace talks of this nature were futile at a time leading political figures of his camp were being subjected to a political witch-hunt and revenge taking.
Is Rajapaksas consent for a unifying the two camps contingent on wrongdoers of previous government being let off scott free True, one could appreciate the concerns entertained by the SLFP faction in the Unity Government about the consequences of a split in the party. Not only Local Government elections but even two crucial Provincial Council elections too have to be held within this year. It is also understandable why Chief Minister Mahipala Herath was entrusted the task of belling the cat- that is making the initial approach to MR-since Sabaragamuwa is one of the two provinces that will go to the polls. The fears of a certain defeat for the SLFP, entertained by other party stalwarts, resulting from a split, is also understandable.
But on no account should they compromise on the Yahapalanaya governments pledge to bring to book all crooked elements of the last government. Is Rajapaksa suggesting that all cases against the corrupt elements of the former regime be withdrawn, as a condition for coalescing with the rival faction Is MR also insisting that the implementation of the law be held in abeyance just for the sake of political expediency
MP Abeywardena who communicated the former Presidents views in this regard to the Daily News could not be unaware that two junior Rajapaksas are already facing serious cases of money laundering. Does he want these cases to be thrown out, all for the sake of reuniting estranged political factions Does the MP once again desire a government who pays scant regard to the law where its head even instructed the Attorney General to terminate cases against rapists and murderers Does Abeywardena want the country to be ruled with impunity once again where the terms accountability and transparency were alien to its rulers
President Sirisena who gave his blessings for this meeting should have no misgivings as to Rajapaksas true intentions. The JO is waiting for an opportunity to get its members, now being paraded before the various commissions off the hook. The public is watching as to how the government, nay the President, is going to act in this matter. Will the President compromise on the firm pledge given to the public on eradicating corruption from the body politic, and what is more, bring the crooks to book Reneging on a vital pledge to the public, just for the sake of winning a Local Government election, could only act to the detriment of the SLFP in the government fold. The President should say a firm no to the conditions insisted on by MR for a thaw on the latters part.
Wimal, the true patriot
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has declared Wimal Weerawansa a true patriot adding that placing the National Freedom Front Leader behind bars could not stop him from giving leadership to the patriotic forces of the country. Speaking at the 22nd anniversary of the NFF at the Sugathadasas Stadium, Rajapaksa also said that imprisoning WW could not hinder his political activity, adding that it was WW who stood for the true principles of the JVP, which he quit.
Weerawansa was taken into custody following investigations into charges that he misappropriated government vehicles for the personal use of relatives and associates. Hence, there no doubt would have been a prima facie case against the MP. There were also charges that he allocated housing units constructed under his ministry, similarly, to relatives and friends for little or no returns. WW also once staged a fast opposite the UN compound in Colombo but was shown in the media to be taking refreshments during the fast. He was also seen leading a mob opposite the UN compound where, following a telephone call, allegedly from Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the police guarding the compound were humiliated, with some of the officers hats snatched away by the Weerawansa led mob, as per video footage of the incident. So much for patriotism.

Mr. Trump goes to Washington
During and since the presidential election, Donald Trumps critics (of which I was one) lost no opportunity to inform the public about their concerns over both his policies and character. The American voter was unmoved. Now, all of us are grappling with voter indifference to  even enthusiastic rejection of  our concerns.
My not-very-original theory is that Trump won the election because a) Americans are deeply worried about the way the economy is changing; b) elites of both parties have been insufficiently responsive to voter exasperation; and c) Democratic and independent voters were underwhelmed by the Democratic candidate  a fact exacerbated by Russian manipulation and unfavourable circumstance.
One of the marvels of the American political system is its wide-openness. As Clarence Darrow once joked: When I was a boy, I was told that anybody could become president. Now Im beginning to believe it.
There are no real barriers to entry for candidates: not credentialing, not party discipline, not media gatekeepers. Not even money, which in this election served to keep a wider ideological range of candidates viable, not prevent them from becoming so.
American voters
Nor is electing inexperienced or anti-establishment leaders all that rare. American voters take satisfaction in jolting the system every 40 or 50 years by catapulting to power someone running against the established political order: Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Grover Cleveland, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Barack Obama. Our political system has the ability to shake the cage of the establishment and revivify itself, something prophets of American decline often overlook.
Although Trump won the election, and admirably appointed to his cabinet a number of accomplished secretaries whose sober, sensible views differ from his own, serious concerns remain about his stewardship of the state. And lets be clear about the power of the executive: The president has the ability to sweep into power a huge number of his advocates to staff the machinery of state.
Even in propitious times, thoughtful people worry about the future of our country. Anticipating the trial of revolution, no less a patriot than Abigail Adams fretted in May 1775: If we look forward, we must shudder at the view.
The best defense against all enemies, foreign and domestic, is political and social cohesion.
Trumps campaign promises
Most conservatives have been hoping that Congress will serve as the crucial brake on Trump. After all, the Republican Party holds both chambers, considers itself to have an electoral mandate, will face a 2018 election on favourable electoral terrain, and is eager to fill the policy vacuum of Trumps campaign promises. Curiously enough, Trump may prove to be a crucial brake on the ideological intransigence of my fellow Republicans in Congress.
Because our president-elect has no apparent ideology, he is at liberty to pick and choose issues.
His genius at direct communication with voters will amplify the megaphone of the bully pulpit over other voices.
His unorthodox approach to politics does raise serious questions about compliance with laws, norms, and even the Constitution. But it may also free Trump to create a mlange of policies that rebuilds a cohesive center in American politics: infrastructure spending, debt reduction, universal (catastrophic) health insurance, tax and regulatory reform, increased border control, less emphasis on culture wars. Many of these policies are contradictory, but he has injected dynamism into stale debates.
Voters willingness to elect him despite concerns about some of his approaches gives him trade space. Despite targeting big businesses, economic sentiment is positive; and growth attenuates many social and political frictions. It is counterintuitive, I know. Progressives, independents, and even some Republicans will be loath to credit so polarizing and offensive a figure no matter what his policy successes are.
But this is my hopeful view of what is necessary, and may even be possible, for our country as the 45th president takes his oath of office.

Nadal subdues Monfils to break quarter-final drought
Melbourne: Rafael Nadal fought back to deny mercurial Frenchman Gael Monfils over four sets and reach his first Grand Slam quarter-final since 2015 at the Australian Open on Monday.
The 14-time Grand Slam champion defeated sixth-seeded Monfils 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 on Rod Laver Arena in almost three hours and will play Canadas world number three Milos Raonic in the quarters.
It was a gutsy effort from the never-say-die Spaniard, who was down a service break with a fifth set looming before he broke sixth-seeded Monfils twice to clinch victory. The 2009 champion reached the last eight in Melbourne for the ninth time. He hasnt contested a Grand Slam quarter-final since the 2015 French Open.
Im very happy being in the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam after a couple of years without being there, he said.
I start the season playing quarter-finals in a Grand Slam again, especially on hard court after a couple of years without being in this round which is great news.
It was Nadals first win over a top-10 player at a Grand Slam since he defeated number two Novak Djokovic to win the title at Roland Garros in 2014, his last major win.
Gael is a special player. He is able to play unbelievable shots. It is a pleasure to see him in the top rankings, Nadal said.
Sometimes its tough to play against Gael when you dont know what hes going to do. He combines mistakes with great shots.
Nadal will go into his Australian quarter-final with a 6-2 lead over Raonic in their previous meetings.
Hes an opponent that makes you feel that youre playing with a lot of pressure all the time because his serve is huge and hes playing very aggressive from the baseline, Nadal said.
Monfils was broken in his opening service game as Nadal went on to take the first set in 46 minutes. -AFP

NCE to resolve bottlenecks related to RAMIS implementation
The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE)held its 22nd AGM on January 17, 2017 at the Grand Ballroom of Hotel Galadari in Colombo, amidst its member exporters, and distinguished invitees. The official business of the AGM comprised election of Office Bearers for the year 2017, Members of the Council which is the policy making body, and Sectoral Heads in the Council to lead the various Products and Services sectors of member exporters to represent issues related to their sectors.
Ramal Jasinghe was elected as the President of NCE. Jasinghe has been involved with the Chamber since 1997 as a Council member, thereafter moving along the ranks as Assistant Treasurer, Treasurer, Assistant Secretary, Secretary and as Vice President, having served in the Management Committee as well .
In his address he underscored the valuable role played by the Past Presidents who have guided the destiny of the Chamber, and looked forward to their continued guidance in the future to realize the goals of the Chamber, to enhance services for the wellbeing, and best interests of the membership.
He proposed to strengthen the efficiency and relevance of the Chamber, to the membership and stakeholders, by professionalising its human resources to implement the planned work program ,with the objective of carving out a special place for the Chamber, incorporating information technology to the best possible extent, to keep abreast of modern trends in disseminating information and knowledge.
He also proposed to engage in a program of work to enhance the image of the Chamber amongst the members, as well as stakeholders,by implementing new activities that will benefit members, and facilitate the elevation of the Chamber to a higher professional level.
Outlining the current export scenario, he stated that in 2015 earnings from exports declined by 5.6 % to US$ 10.5 billion year on year compared to 2014 led by a drop in agricultural and industrial exports, largely reflecting the downward movement of International Commodity Prices and the slower growth in large economies which are Sri Lanka's major export destinations.
This trend continued in 2016 with the statistics up to July revealing a further drop of 4.1 % compared to the corresponding period up to July 2015. Although imports also contracted by 2.5 % in 2015, due to lower commodity prices, and a drop in Imports of Capital Goods, the deficit in the trade balance continues to expand. He added that in this backdrop of the declining trend in exports as a percentage of the GDP from around 33% to 17% over the last decade, the achievement of the national export target of US$ 30 billion by 2020 is a huge challenge that requires effective contributions by all stake holders, and saw a pivotal role for the Chamber to play in this scenario.
He stated that the primary duty of the Chamber is to play a complementary role to the efforts of the Government and relevant State Institutions for the Promotion and Development of exports to accelerate economic development, and added that for this purpose Export Policy Formulation and Development is of prime importance which is urgently required.
In this context the Chamber was already actively engaged with the Ministry of Strategy Development and International Trade in the formulation of the National Trade Policy as well as with negotiations of the proposed Trade Agreements with India, China and Singapore. Forums with members have already been conducted to discuss the concerned issues.
He further stated that the Chamber will continue to discuss at the Council important Sectoral Issues that need the attention of the state authorities to facilitate exports. In this regard the Chamber is currently actively engaged with the Government, to resolve bottlenecks related to implementation of the Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS), and the abolition of the current SVAT system.
President Ramal Jasinghe and SG and CEO Shiham Marikar
He thereafter outlined the activities he proposed to give leadership to the Chamber.
In conclusion the New President stated that he will endeavor with the assistance of his colleagues in the Council and Management Committee, to work with the relevant state authorities, to try and obtain for the chamber a suitable premises for long term lease, or at least a piece of land on long term lease, to house the facilities and services of the chamber in a conducive location, since this is a constraint at present for the Chamber to enhance its services to Exporters in an effective manner, and reiterated that the Chamber will be vigilant, alert and active to respond constructively to changes in Government Policy and Proposals.
The Newly appointed President stated that he will utilize the skills and strengths of the current staff of the Chamber and particularly the leadership provided by the Secretary General Shiham Marikar, and the expertise of the Consultant Geoffrey Tillekeratne, in assisting and guiding the activities of the Chamber with their professional knowledge.
Secretary General Shiham Marikar assured the new President his commitment and support, by providing leadership to the Secretariat Staff of the Chamber , to achieve the objectives of the work programme outlined in his address.
To facilitate this task he proposed to prepare a grid covering the work programme with Key Performance Indications (KPI's) for each activity, along with responsibilities and tasks for each staff member to monitor successful implementation.
The chief guest at the event was Tung-Lai Margue, Ambassador of the EU delegation to Sri Lanka.The Ambassador said the EU continues to be an important trading partner for Sri Lanka as the number one Export Partner and the second largest Import Partner.
In 2015 Sri Lanka's Exports to the EU were 2.6 billion Euro while Imports were 2.1 Billion Euro. Garments continued to dominate Sri Lanka's Exports to the EU, wherein the EU imported 1.6 billion Euro worth of Garments which represented 63% of Sri Lanka's total Exports to the EU.
He further stated that Sri Lanka by closely working together with the EU has brought tangible results for Trade related issues. Firstly, the new EU funded Trade related Technical Assistance Project worth 8 Million Euro will enhance the efficiency of cross border procedures , and the capacity of SME's to comply with the rules and procedures when exporting to SAARC countries , and EU Markets; Secondly lifting of the ban of fisheries products; and Thirdly the progress achieved with the GSP+.
He went on to elaborate that fisheries products to the EU were banned until recently due to noncompliance with EU regulations to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. However, following the ban the EU and Sri Lanka worked very closely together resulting in Sri Lanka putting in place a fisheries management system which is not only unique in the region, but has also enabled Sri Lanka to increase her fisheries exports considerably, with-in a very short period of time.
He added that similarly the new government of Sri Lanka after having set-out on a path of major reforms at National Reconciliation, respect for Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Good Governance principles, re-applied for GSP+ in July 2016; and the European Commission after having studied the application concluded that Sri Lanka met the GSP+ entry criteria in the EU regulations.
This decision has now been transmitted to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU who will have up to four months to enter into force implementation, if both the European Parliament and the Council do not oppose the decision of the Commission. In this regard he noted that it would be of benefit for Sri Lanka to continue implementing reforms to improve Human Rights and Good Governance.
He said that obtaining GSP+ will enable Sri Lanka to have duty free access to the EU for all export sectors thus bringing considerable benefits. For example 60% of EU imports from Sri Lanka which is clothing and currently pays an import duty of around 9.6% would become duty free. Fisheries products which currently pay duties from 14.5% to 18.5% will also become duty free. Similarly, the agro food sector which currently pays an average import duty of 12% will become duty free, thereby immensely helping Sri Lanka to be export competitive.
Further-more GSP+ has the potential to encourage backward integration, because in order to qualify, the rules of origin criteria need to be met. For example in the garments sector yarn onwards has to be produced in Sri Lanka, which in turn will contribute to Sri Lanka's diversification to other products and sectors.
He added that GSP+ will also attract more Foreign Direct Investments (FDI's) since foreign investors will be encouraged to set up manufacturing businesses in Sri Lanka in order to benefit from zero duty access to the EU Market. In this regard the Ambassador was happy to note that the Finance Minister had recently reconfirmed that more facilities would be offered to foreign investors such as 5-year Resident Visa's, lease of land for large scale investments, and allowing to own property for residential purposes etc..,
In conclusion he stated that the transformation of Sri Lanka to upper middle income status requires a rebalance of the Economic Growth model to be a more open , private sector led , and be able to develop and sell high value goods and services in the Global and Domestic Market, since the EU understood that the Government is keen to pursue Exported Growth , and an FDI Growth model.
Since the private sector and in particular SME's which the NCE well serves being in the forefront to operationalize and benefit from Government Policies, and, assistance made available by the EU , he urged the use of these to further contribute to increase Trade and Investments. The EU which has been a long standing friend to Sri Lanka will continue to be an active development and business partner in supporting the economy to better integrate with the global economy to improve prosperity for Sri Lankan citizens.
The Guest of Honour was Dr. Nishan De Mal, Executive Director, and Head of Research of the well known Research Organization Verite Research, which is engaged in valuable research work on International Trade, working with the relevant stakeholders including the NCE, providing insights to contemporary challenges faced by Sri Lankan Exporters.
Dr. Nishan De Mel in his address stated that Sri Lanka should place her house in order before being concerned about barriers at foreign borders related to International Trade , particularly in relation to the proposed Free Trade Agreements with several countries.
He added that according to research carried out by his organization, Exporters face four types of barriers. They are (1) barriers faced inside a foreign country, (2) barriers at the border of a foreign country, (3) barriers at the domestic border, and (4) barriers within the home country, even before exports reach the border. He stated that we must rethink seriously barriers our exporters face inside our own border before we worry about external barriers, although it is clearly established that Sri Lankan Exporters face excessive non-tariff barriers ( NTB's) both at the border and inside the border , when exporting to countries like India in spite of having a two-decade old FTA with India.
Outlining the internal export barriers Dr. De Mel said that Sri Lanka reels with the acute problem of inefficiency due to delays in the bureaucracy at all levels of the state sector. In this regard he cited the example of Sri Lanka trying to process documents electronically, and accept e-signatures since the mid 1990's , but has failed to get the project off the ground for over two decades. According to Dr. De Mel, this is not due to the absence of the required law to that effect, but due to non-implementation of the law by the bureaucrats.
He added that processing electronic documents, and accepting e-signature makes the life of an exporter much easier and also results in significally lower costs whereas even a tiny little African country like Senegal accepts electronic signatures. On the other hand Sri Lanka has been systematically falling behind due to administrative and information problems that we face inside our own country. That prevents us for making progress. He went on to say that Sri Lanka passed a law on electronic documents processing, and acceptance of e-signatures, back in 2006. However, the bureaucracy which was tasked with implementation of the law has resisted it for over 10 years. According to statistics presented by Dr. De Mel , Malaysia has seen the documents processing time reduced from 12 hours to 15minutes after migrating to electronic processing and the cargo turnaround time coming down from 4 days to 2 days.
Highlighting another shortcoming Dr. De Mel said the at Sri Lanka does not have a National Trade Portal , which is a basic necessity for exporters to access important changes in policies and procedures , whereas such portals are available in less developed countries like Bangladesh, the Philippines , Myanmar, and Cambodia.
He concluded by stating that Sri Lanka's export earnings have declined from around 33% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP ) in 2000 to 12.7% of GDP in 2015. However the policy makers of the country have come up with the lofty target to triple export earnings from the current USD 10 billion to USD 30 billion in just less than 4 years.

Opening doors for french speakers
Alliance Francaise is one institute that offers Sri Lankan students an exciting and fulfilling future. It is an institute that offers lucrative opportunities for growth and attractive job prospects. With the new Director of Alliance Francaise de Kotte Francis Cappe, assuming his duties last September, Alliance Francaise met media personalities to upgrade the public on the good reasons to learn French.
I have two points to emphasize and one point to clarify. Sri Lanka has entered the tourism age. In 2016 the number of French tourists visiting the country was more than 100,000. And we feel that there will be much more in coming years. So the French government has recognized Sri Lankas potential. We expect the number of French tourists to reach the number of 200,000 in 2020. So Sri Lanka will be in need of French speaking guides. The Alliance Francaise network in Sri Lanka which includes Kotte, Matale, Kandy and Jaffna is very much key to developing French speaking guides, said Ambassador of France to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Jean Marin Schuh.
Schuh mentioned that since Sri Lanka is developing fast, there are more students eager to go to foreign countries with this development.
In France we are extremely eager to receive more Sri Lankan students. The Alliance Francaise network is the entry gate for this. We offer courses for future Sri Lankan students to study in France. We believe that in France we have a big advantage compared to other countries. The University studies are strongly subsidized by French tax payers. Which means the studies are quite cheap. This is because it is highly subsidized. It is the same price for French and Foreign students, stated Schuh
Schuh mentioned that they are most eager to welcome Sri Lankan students.
President of Alliance Francaise de Kotte, Chandra Wickramasinghe, mentioned that just after independence that there were three European Cultural institutes started in Sri Lanka.
They were the British Council promoting cultural relationships between Britain and Sri Lanka. Then there was the Allliance Francaise and the German cultural institute. So we have a very long history with the Alliance Francaise. The contribution of the Alliance Francaise to the Sri Lankan tourism economy is enormous, said Wickramasinghe.
Wickramasinghe mentioned that the Francophone Entrepreneurs produced thanks to Alliance Francaise is commendable.
Commendable in the sense, we have in Sri Lanka about 20 to 25 travel agents, ex- students of Alliance Francaise and they are running those travel agencies very well. And most of them speak very good French. More and more French speaking Entrepreneurs are investing here on travel as well as hotels. So even myself, I started my own company in the 1980s and it is thanks to the French knowledge I obtained from this institution. So Alliance Francaise has done a lot for Sri Lanka. So French tourists are looking for Francophone travel agencies and we need guides, pointed out Wickramasinghe.
In 2010, we had only 30,000 French people coming to Sri Lanka. Now we have 100,000 French tourists. So this is a market that is really thriving. So we need so many French speaking staff in Sri Lanka. So we have excellent teachers at Alliance Francaise and they are doing a remarkable job.
So we can employ these students without any hesitation from his institute.
They can write and talk and be excellent guides and be travel executives, added Wickramasinghe.

## Title: The oriental magic of Dilshan

The oriental magic of Dilshan
A fighting unbeaten century stand by the buccaneering Tillekeratne Dilshan and the stolid Angelo Mathews was keeping Sri Lanka in the picture on the Third Day of The Test Match between Sri Lanka and Australia. This action took place in Australia a few years back, the place to be exact was Hobart, Tasmania.
Dilshans unbeaten hundred thus far has showcased the talent he possesd as a world class batsman, in all three formats of the game.The Aussie pace trio of Siddle, Hilfenhause and Starc was no match for him, Watson and Lyon were also treated by him with equal disdain.
Dilshan squared up to the aggressive pace attack on equal terms, no quarters were given no quarters were asked, chin to chin, toe to toe he faced the abrasive Aussies. The difference between them was that Dilshan possessed the Oriental Magic about him and he was not all brawn but brains as well. Dilshans penetration of the cover region, with exquisite wristy stroke play, would have made the late great Sathasivam proud. On this day he was in full element, he was carving out boundaries, square of the wicket, through the covers, past the bowler and off his pads, with wristy power laced with liquid grace. This type of great batsman is born only on the subcontinent in the main. In analysing the performance, of the top three batsmen thus far, on the tour. Sangakkara has been going through a lean patch on the tour.
In comparison among the three, Sanga seemed more intelligent of the trio due to the fact that he was picking the gaps at will through sheer timing and placement. He had ample time to plug the gaps at will. In spite being gifted to the hilt , I found at the time that he was more sensitive to the surroundings at the beginning of his innings, and the abrasive and arrogant Aussies smelled a rat, and had made a note of it to capitalise on it. His poor run so far in the recent past, bears enough testimony to this shortcoming. Perhaps one could deduce that Sangas skin was a shade thinner than what it was in his hay day. At that time a short withdrawal from the scene would have done a world of good to him. The Sri Lankan team was looking for an opportunity to plug in young Chandimal, who was waiting in the wings oozing with talent.
Mahelas decision to quit the captaincy duties after the tour was a good one, and he has been shouldering this burden very well in the recent past, where a packed match schedule was evident, and hats off to him for quitting at the correct time. With this burden off his shoulder, the cricketing world in the future, will witness his true stature as a great batsman.
The captaincy issue then came into focus again, Angelo Mathews was learning the trade fast, and it could have been unfair by the talented youngster to be thrown into the deep end, prematurely. Mathews was becoming a class batting all-rounder by the day, and then we saw a slimmer version of him. To keep him simmering for a while without bringing him to boil would have been the order of the day then.
Provided that Sangakkaras lean patch could end abruptly. I myself feel that Thilan or Sangakkara should have taken up the reins, the former for his fighting qualities in adversities and the latter for being a born leader. Sanga is capable of taking up challenges, we have seen in the past that Sanga can give as good as he gets, I can still remember the master sledging he gave Shaun Pollock when he strode into bat in a match few years back, the language he used was unmentionable although it had a ring of Shakespeare about it.
Shaun Pollock the sportsman that he was acknowledged this banter by Sanga stating This bloke is certainly good at it
In a few days, our young guns will battle it out with the South Africans in their home patch, playing in the shortest version of the game initially.
The selectors have brought in a fresh face called Thikshila de Silva this seems to be a bold and a good move, they might have thrown him to the deep end, but if he clicks he would be breaking the ice and that would be a good omen for Sri Lankans flagging spirits.
Same goes to persisting with the other youngsters in the pack, Dhananjaya de Silva and Kusal Mendis, they all should come good hopefully, sooner than later.

The problems faced by pharmacy owners due to price reduction of 48 drugs will be solved soon, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to the minister, some pharmacy owners say they are making losses due to the price reduction.
I will intervene to solve the issue of receiving commissions and the loss making issues, he said. He was addressing the Galle District Pharmacy Entrepreneurs Association Annual General Meeting in Galle recently.
Minister Senaratne said the prices were reduced after 45 years, and the sales of State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) has gone up by 20 percent after the reduction. The government annually spends Rs. 72 billion to treat patients who fall sick by smoking. Therefore, the tax on tobacco was increased by 90 percent, he said.
Fifty five percent of the population obtain medical treatment from the state sector while only 45 percent visit the private sector. More people visit the state sector because free health service is fully implemented now, he said.

Plantation housing scheme used for political advantage: CWRFU
The Ceylon Workers Red Flag Union (CWRFU) accused Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Ministry officials of using the plantation housing development scheme to increase the number of members to the trade union and party affiliated with the minister.
In a statement to the media, CWRFU General Secretary Menaka Kandasamy stated that the high ranking officials were using development projects as a means to coerce and intimidate workers to join the party and its trade union.
It is the right of every worker to join a trade union of his or her choice. During the membership drive in December, we have evidence that in areas such as Deniyaya and Maskeliya, workers have been told that they would not get houses if they did not join the trade union of the minister and his party. In Deniyaya, officials have publicly stated thus, the CWRFU release added.
The release added that political and resource powers of Deniyaya Pradeshiya Sabha were being used for such activities.
It is the responsibility of the minister and ministry including the government to ensure that all citizens gain benefits from development projects regardless of their political affiliations and not use it to their own political advantage. This is clear misuse of state resources and constitutes as corruption, it added.
The plantation housing scheme which was initially promised during the 100 day programme built 400 houses during that period. In 2016, the ministry stated that they built a further 1,100 houses and in 2017 they plan to build 10,000 houses.
The target is to have 50,000 houses built for those in the plantation sector by 2020.
Minister says...
Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister P. Thigambaram who is also the leader of the National Union of Workers, contacted by the Daily News with regard to the allegations, said all houses were given through the Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT) and Estate Administration Offices and that they knew of it better than he.

A R Rahman turns 50
Iconic composer-singer A.R. Rahman, who has not just mesmerised music lovers and is credited with changing the sound of Indian film music, but also made the country proud with his Oscar and Grammy wins, turned 50 on Friday. His close associates shared their thoughts on the artiste whom they consider gods special child.
Rahman is known for fusing Indian and western sounds in an efficient way, and also introduced many new talents in the industry. One such name is singer Sukhwinder Singh, who made his mark in 1999 with the song Chaiyya chaiyya. He continued his journey with Rahman and sang Jai ho -- the Oscar-winning track from Slumdog Millionaire.
Asked what makes Rahman stand out, Sukhwinder said: The world has acknowledged his genius and I have been fortunate to work with him on numerous occasions. His understanding of music is so vast that he can perhaps capture any mood in one song. Also, the fact that his music grows on you, is a quality all composers should imbibe.
Versatile singer Sonu Nigam, who has lent his voice for many of Rahmans compositions like Ishq bina, Hai guzarish, In lamhon ke daaman mein, Saathiya, Khamoshiyan gungunane lagi and Satrangi re, called the musical genius gods special child.
He said: Everything about him is inspirational. His talent, his composure, his exclusivity, his foresight and moreover how he is protected by the universe because of his detachment to the material things in life... Thats what makes him an icon of this generation.
It is interesting how Rahman has worked with various genres -- be it Indian classical, folk to electronic music and orchestral arrangement, and touched all the right emotional chords through his various songs. Be it the naughty Kuchi kuchi rakkamma to exploring different shades of romance through Ye haseen waadiya, Roja and Tere bina to capturing the vulnerability of a young man through Naadaan parindey, a spiritual number like Kun faaya kun and the evergreen Maa tujhe salaam (Vande mataram) -- Rahman has done it all.
Appreciating his contribution to Hindi film music, popular composer Rajesh Roshan said: His power is in his innovative approach towards music.Taking a bit of risk to create some new melody is his signature (style), and that is what he is acclaimed for. I appreciate it.

Raviraj Murder Case: Appeal filed by aggrieved party re-listed for support

The appeal filed by the wife of former TNA Jaffna district MP Nadaraja Raviraj challenging the Colombo High Courts judgment to release the five accused, including three Navy intelligence officers, in the Raviraj murder case, was fixed for support on March 3 by the Court of Appeal.
When the matter was taken up through a motion, the Court of Appeal two-judge-bench bench comprising Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Lalith Jayasuriya decided to vacate the earlier order to dismiss the appeal.
On January 19, when the application was taken before the two-judge-Bench comprising Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Lalith Jayasuriya neither the petitioner nor a lawyer representing the petitioner were present in Court and petition was dismissed accordingly.
The aggrieved party informed Court the document issued by the registry of High Court of Colombo was incomplete with several critical documents including the order of the High Court Judge dated 27th October, 2016 rejecting the objections of the aggrieved party to the matter being heard by a special jury and such aggrieved party is not in a position to seek a date of support of this application.
Therefore, the aggrieved party moved Court to be pleased to list this application for support for leave after the complete set of documents are made available them.
The aggrieved party, Sasikala Raviraj, wife of the slain MP filed this appeal seeking an order to set aside the verdict of the Colombo High Court dated December 23, 2016 to acquit and release all accused from the case.
On December 23, 2016, three Navy intelligence officers and two others, accused in the Raviraj murder, were acquitted and released from the case after they were found not guilty by jury trial.
The verdict which was delivered by High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke as per the unanimous decision was reached by the jury, following a month long trial.
The jurys decision was that the accused cannot be convicted based on the evidence in the case.
The petitioner further sought an order to set aside the order of the High Court allowing the request of the accused for the case to be tried before a jury.
The petitioner stated that a trial by jury cannot be accepted in this case since three charges out of five had been levelled under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).
The High Court allowed to proceed with the Raviraj murder trial in absentia of the three accused Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint who were evading Court since the initiation of investigations.
The indictments were filed against six accused Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Prasad Chandana Kumara alias Sampath, Gamini Seneviratne, Pradeep Chaminda alias Vajira, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint on five counts, including committing the murder of Raviraj and his security officer Lokuwella Murage Laksman under the provisions of the PTA and Penal Code.
Three accused suspects who were not present before Court, had been identified as ex-LTTE cadres affiliated to the Karuna faction.
Wijeya Wickrema Manamperige Sanjaya Preethi Viraj was made state witness in the Raviraj murder trial.

Rooting out Trees, strangling Wanni life
My husband owns this land. Here we were not able to grow any crops for a long time because of the war. After the war, the government returned the land to us. Our homes are in Kilinochchi; we have started cultivating this land now. Legally, we can remove unnecessary timber on our land if we need, 61-year-old Sinnamma said. Sinnamma does not know about the gravity of the environmental harm the felling of trees causes. After all she has returned to her land at Mukkappan in Kilinochchi after 30 long years. She just wants to restart cultivation and live in peace on her own land.
She simply feels overjoyed and grateful as she finally got the opportunity to carry on with her life. But opportunistic politicians and timber smugglers exploit people like her to carry out complex and massive timber smuggling operation.
An investigation into the illicit timber trade in the area revealed that many resettled people in the area have cultivated beyond the acre of land given to them by the government. Timber smugglers also use these lands to carry out their illegal logging. Kilinochchi soil is rich in iron. It contains a red-yellow latosol, silica, and aluminium oxides. Its colour is so distinct it was called Thamirawani, which was later led to the region being called the Wanni. It is also the root of the names Thamirawani, Thambuwani, Thammanna or Thambapanni - the ancient names of the island. The Kilinochchi district spans 1,279 sq. km. and 32km towards Mannar from the Mukkappan-Arassapuram Forest Reserve. The regional temperature is quite high. Rains mostly come once a year. But now anyone can hardly predict the rain. Perhaps the increased deforestation may have caused the climate change, but Sinnamma and her family prefer not to think too much of the bigger picture,
We were very happy now. We had to flee the region when the war erupted. We simply had no choice. My husband, two sons and daughter were taken by the movement (LTTE) several times. At the end, my youngest son and I left Mukkappan. When we were in Kilinochchi, the war was at its worst. However, my husband and two sons used to visit us in secret, she said. Just as we left, they also left us, her daughter Thangamma said. She was forced to work with the LTTE. After the war, Thangamma was sent to a rehabilitation camp and she returned home a year after.
Now we three carry on with our lives without much fuss, she added. However, what they had gone through, the pain and trauma, have not left them. Their eyes show it all, and the pain they underwent at the loss of their family members still haunts them. Sinnamma and her family, like many other resettled families in the area, got only permits to their lands. They were not given title deeds as they expected.
The Mukkappan-Arassapuram Reserve lies to the right of Sinnammas land. Further into the reserve, one can witnessed the clearings where once were trees. The trees lie strewn about, felled, torn from their roots - the pristine environment that was once there, has gone. Huge machines had been used for logging and clearing.
The reserve is now a centre of a massive illegal timber operation. Several valuable trees were logged and taken away. Many are being sawed. Our guide made us know that an organised group was involved in the illegal logging operation.
As we proceeded, we heard the noise of felling trees and birds' restless cries. We saw around two acres of cleared land and the people on it preparing for some other illegal task. As we approached them, they stopped working and shockingly looked at us and the camera in our hands. Raju, one of the workers, informed us that they do any work for a day wager.
The man who owned this land asked us to clear this area. He told us that this was his land and that he had all the documents to prove it. Thats why we work here. We have heard that many fell the trees in the forest and take them away. I dont know who they are. We are not residents of this area, he said. As we left the area, we turned around to see them get on bicycles and disappear further into the forest. They might not have told us the truth. Perhaps, they were being exploited for the timber smuggling and land grabbing operations.
About 40 km from the site, lies the district Forest Officers office. It houses two buildings. When we reached the office, a woman at a desk informed us that the officer just had his lunch and was resting in the next building. Back at the office, he told us that the LTTE cadres run the group; Posi, Suman, and Pradeepan. They fell trees and transporting them to areas in Kilinochchi and Jaffna. Sseveral government officials helped them because they (officials) want to transport their contraband across.
We do not get any support to arrest them. We have only seven officers and are extremely short staffed. Our officers do not speak Tamil, so it is very difficult for us to carry out our work. During raids, we have many problems since we cannot communicate in Tamil, he said. If we received more assistance from the police, we would apprehend them, he said.
The problem, however, is that they have support from many government officials. It is under their supervision they transport the timber via forest routes to Kilinochchi and Jaffna, the official said. As the authorities turn a blind eye, trees in close to 12 sq.km of the Mukkappan-Arasapuram area had been ravaged, logged and transported.
If the deforestation continues, the already parched land will face acute water shortages. Apart from the human catastrophe, we are also facing great biodiversity losses that have already made the impacts of climate change very real to all in the Wanni.

The SCREECH of doom followed by KABOOM!
Many boys of my vintage were captivated by comic books since we were around six or thereabouts. Actually we were obsessed by them and for many of us they were our first primers. Contrary to popular conception, I firmly believe they are actually good for young children! I myself could be living proof of this, having read sheaves of quality comic books as a child from publishers such as DC, Marvel and Dell. I can tell you with certainty that they initially helped increase my vocabulary and instilled in me a love of reading. A lot of the criticism of comics came from people who thought that children were just looking at the pictures and not putting them together with the words.
Possibly it may have been in the case with some children. But not in mine! My maternal grandfather realised quite sagaciously that comics were the first step in inculcating the reading habit in impressionable young minds. And he was spot on. We revelled in reading the exploits of the American cowboy celebrities of the time such as Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Wild Bill Elliot, Tom Mix, The Lone Ranger and a host of other Hollywood screen idols. The comic book world has its own slang and jargon just like any other publication. Even more than books with lots of dialogue, comics can be easy to understand and full of idiomatic language as it is actually spoken. I also learned quite early that American English was strangely different from British English.
I was also made aware by the very presence of ungrammatical sentences not to use them. You latch on quickly to certain words and phrases in American dialect such as for example allow, guess, reckon, which means to think. Or the word gotten, where got is being used as the past participle of get. But, most atrocious to the stiff upper-lip English purists was the heavy use of contractions such as aint, cant, dont, and couldnt. So, as a matter of fact, you learn not to use words and phrases you shouldnt. Sorry, should not.
There were many comic books that had hyper-muscled dudes in tight-fitting duds beating up wrong-doers. Superheroes reigned supreme on the bookshop stands. In those halcyon days there were comics of every conceivable genre, horror, Westerns, war stories. All shared top billing with the guys in ridiculous capes or two-gun toting cowboys wearing ten gallon stetsons. Romance comics were also really popular, but largely with the girls. All we guys were set on was action and adventure with a biff and a bang and a whack and a whop. Naturally all this type of avenging heroics inspired a whopping good time in fisticuffs in the compounds and playing fields of boys schools at the time.
Looking at all these words with analytical eyes, I discovered just how much the impact of an image lies in the internally heard sound effect that I read as I took in the image. The SKREEECH of a car sliding around a corner helped me to hear as well as see the image! And then the climactic huge, juddering KABOOOM! It was complemented by stars of all varieties to amplify the effects and impact of the collision or explosion. All in all, the illustrations were also exceptionally exciting to our tender susceptible minds.
You even begin to notice little things, such as the way otherwise empty panels sometimes contain coughs or sighs which breathe life into the image. I learned much later that the genre was called onomatopoeia, which in simple anglo-saxon means the formation of a word, such as kapow, slam, honk and vroom, by imitationof a sound made by or associated with its referent. I was still surprised to learn that words such as bam goes as far back as 1922, having been used in James Joyces Ulysses. Pow goes back even further, first appearing in an 1881 issue of Scribners. Ka-boom goes back to E. Fields Slug, published in 1876.
So you see, you cant blame comics for words or nuances that have been conjured up by reputed masters of classical literature such as Joyce or Fields who were trendsetters of such fanciful terms. Comic books were educational, they were empowering but also inspiring. Those special sound effects they conjured up were imaginative works of comic book literature. They described an incident with amazingly constructive economy. When I analysed my early reading experience, I realised just how important onomatopoeia is with regard to the comic book writers lexicon. For instance, think of the image of a punch being thrown with POW! being emblazoned in large explosive letters. Now take POW! away, and what does the image look like Just the punch, all by itself, which loses a lot of its zap!
With the benefit of hindsight I must concede that that many of the comics at the time bordered on the ridiculous although their creators must be given full credit for their bizarre imagination. Spiderman had a large spider emblem on his shirt, which is rarely the best way to make friends and influence people. Captain Americas outfit seemed dazzling to me when I first clapped eyes on it as an eight-year-old. When it comes to dealing with baddies, you simply can't beat a combination of red, white and blue.
Sadly, when it comes to such areas, superheroes such as the famous Superman have a terrible reputation for dress sense. He and his many imitators have been ridiculed for wearing their underpants over their trousers. As though that weren't bad enough, there were also such lapses in taste in the heroines such as Wonder Woman's star-spangled abominations and Supergirl's bright, red- hot pants. And so it was with the curvaceous Valkyrie, who zapped the older teenagers with metal hubcaps to hide her well-endowed appendages of Valhalla. There was also Conan the Barbarian who followed Tarzan who still towers over his fictional peers with aplomb.
But those with a little imagination should tell them a thing or three about indecent exposure. For both the superheroines as well as the Barbarian and Ape Man their outfits may be eye-catching, but one fears that such skimpy adornments might also prove uncomfortably cold in winter.
Imitating them might be dangerous because the cops might kapow you to boot. And Ill join in with a KABOOM! And a big smile.

Serena grinds down dogged Strycova to reach quarter-finals
MELBOURNE, Monday - Serena Williams battled a misbehaving serve and scorching heat but stayed cool under pressure in a 7-5 6-4 win over Czech Barbora Strycova to reach the Australian Open quarter-finals on Monday.
Second seed Williams was broken three times in the opening set at Rod Laver Arena and again when coasting to the finish line in the second but shifted up a gear when it counted to close out the match in one hour and 46 minutes.
I think she's a really smart player, she can do everything, said Williams of the hard-running Strycova, who caused at shock at last year's tournament by dumping third seed Garbine Muguruza out in the third round.
It's always good I have something I can improve on and I know I can do better on my serve.
Williams, bidding to win a record 23rd grand slam title in the professional era, has now notched 10 consecutive quarter-final appearances at the majors, dating back to the 2014 U.S. Open.
The 35-year-old great next faces the winner of the match between Russian Ekaterina Makarova and British ninth seed Johanna Konta. Williams came into the tournament with doubts about her fitness after she had only two tour matches of preparation since the U.S. Open, but she is yet to drop a set at Melbourne Park.
She was left the highest ranked player in the draw after Angelique Kerber's shock elimination on Sunday.
Worryingly for her opponents, Williams has room to improve as she was far from her clinical best against Strycova, racking up 46 unforced errors and winning only six of her 14 break points. She did not hold serve until her third attempt and was frustrated as 16th seed Strycova saved seven set points in the opening stanza. It took a backhand mishit from Williams to close it out, with her shot barely dribbling over the net.
Williams improved in the second set and raced to a 5-2 lead, as if keen to escape the frying pan of centre court.
She gave Strycova a glimmer of hope, hammering her 45th unforced error into the tramlines to allow the Czech to break back to 5-4.

Six years on, Egyptian activists worry uprising gone to waste
EGYPT: Six years after Hosni Mubarak was forced from power, the activists behind Egypts 2011 uprising are facing a new crackdown and struggling to see much reason for hope.
Rights groups accuse President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of cracking down on freedoms won during the revolt, with many activists now facing prison, asset freezes and travel bans.
Critics of the former army chief -- who was elected after he toppled Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 -- say Sisi does not tolerate any dissent.
The situation is miserable, said Esraa Abdel Fattah, a 38-year-old activist now banned from travel, as she passed by Cairos Tahrir Square, the epicentre of the January 2011 uprising.
Hundreds of thousands of Egyptians protested in the square for 18 days, setting up tents and makeshift hospitals, and demanding an end to Mubaraks 30-year rule.
Im sad for the blood that has gone to waste, Abdel Fattah said, remembering the hundreds killed in the streets as security forces tried to suppress the protests.
Ahmad, a 32-year-old pharmacist who only gave his first name, also took part in the 2011 demonstrations.
Before, I was ready to die for this country, now I just want to leave, he said.
I have transitioned from struggling for democracy and human rights to fighting a daily battle to provide for my familys basic needs, Ahmad said.
Its a daily struggle for survival, he said.
Egyptians have faced shortages of basic goods such as medicine and sugar in past months, with prices soaring after the government floated the currency and slashed fuel subsidies in November.
Those measures were part of economic reforms to meet conditions for a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, which was approved later the same month. There is latent anger because of the economic situation, political scientist Mai Mogib said.
But despite this, nobody wants another revolution. Egyptians are exhausted after a revolt that didnt produce the results they were hoping for, she said.
In the months after the ouster of Morsi, Egypts first democratically elected civilian president, hundreds of his Islamist supporters were killed and thousands more jailed.
The crackdown then expanded to leftist and secular activists, with scores in jail on accusation of participating in unauthorised street protests. Egypt has also been investigating civil society groups on suspicion of receiving illegal foreign funding in a controversial probe criticised by the United Nations.
This month, a court ordered a freeze on the assets of Nazra for Feminist Studies and its founder Mozn Hassan, as well as of Mohamed Zaree and his Arab Penal Reform Organisation. It came after the assets of five other human rights defenders and three non-governmental organisations were frozen in September over similar accusations. The revolution is back to square one, said Hassan, who was also issued a travel ban a few months ago.
We have to defend ourselves in court against accusations (of crimes) we didnt commit, the 37-year-old said.
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have described the travel bans as part of a larger campaign to suppress independent, critical voices inside the country.
The secular April 6 movement, one of the groups that called for the January 25 protests in 2011 and helped ignite the uprising, has been banned by the authorities.
Ahmed Maher, 36, one of its founders and a leading figure in the 2011 revolt, was released earlier this month after spending three years in prison on accusations he organised an unauthorised protest.
But for the next three years, he must spend 12 hours each night at a police station near his home.
Im a half-prisoner, Maher said.
Journalist Ahmad Gamal Ziada, a photojournalist who spent two years in jail after his arrest at a protest he was covering, is just as disillusioned.
Were exhausted, he said. - AFP

SLIIT School of Architecture partners with Liverpool John Moores University, UK
SLIIT being rich in technological resources have established the new school of Architecture which brings together some of the most creative and experienced architects in the country to deliver an international standard programme with state of the art facilities at SLIIT.
The School of Architecture was established last year under the wings of the Faculty of Engineering and the able guidance of one of Sri Lankas most respected and experienced senior Architects; Prof. Nimal De Silva.
SLIIT is a great option for anyone who wishes to become an outstanding Architect who isboth creative and technologically on par with the rest of the world. SLIIT offers a comprehensive, technologically advanced international degree with a Sri Lankan flavor at a fully equipped multidisciplinary campus. International students and well qualified staff will further enrich the experience.
Presently the Degree offered at SLIIT School of Architecture is a B.Sc (Honors) Degree in Architecture from the Liverpool John Moores University in the UK. This international collaboration allows students to either obtain a UK degree directly from SLIIT or to transfer to UK in the final year to complete the degree there since The Liverpool John Moores University has validated the Architecture programme at SLIIT to be in par with their programme back in UK.
Intake numbers are limited for architecture due to individual and one-to-one guidance given to students. SLIIT offers a maximum of 50 seats per year for the Architecture programme.Students are carefully selected through an aptitude test. The minimum requirement for a student to be eligible to sit for the aptitude test is to have passed all three subjects for A-levels in one sitting.
The School promotes students to work on campus where peer learning and resources are available. Each student will have their own studio space to work on projects with 24 hour access. Students also have access to state of the art model making equipment such as lazer cutters and 3D printers where they can explore and experiment. During the programme, the faculty of Architecture will also organize field tours to places of architectural interest where students get to experience and feel for real the elements discussed in the classroom.
A student who studies Architecture at SLIIT, learns about the society, culture, nature, drawing techniques, communication, structural, electrical, mechanical systems and technology which combines with creative design to produce designs or works of Architecture which are for people to use and experience  making their lives better, happier and more comfortable.
Since SLIIT and Liverpool John Moores University are both members of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, a student obtaining a B.Sc. (Hons) Degree in Architecture from SLIIT has an opportunity to enter any state university in Sri Lanka to pursue postgraduate studies in related fields.

State officials must implement govt policies: Vajira
State officials are duty bound to implement the policies of the government in power. That is what the Constitution expects of them and that is what the Establishment Code governing government servants say, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardene said.
Addressing a ceremony to lay the foundation stone for the construction of a five storey-new building for the Jaela Provincial Secretariat, the minister said with the change of government, the President appoints ministers and permanent secretaries. The secretaries shoulder the responsibility of carrying out the policies of the government in power.
No one found fault with state officials who carried out the policies of the Mahinda Chinthana during the past decade. It was the duty of government servants. The Mahinda Chinthana is no more and state officials are expected to carry out the combined policies of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe," he said.
Abeywardene said that there is a clause in the Establishment Code to punish state officials who fail to carry out the policies of the government.
Gampaha district MP Dr. Kavinda Jayawardene, former Speaker and UNP chief organiser Joseph Michael Perera, former Home Affairs Minister Felix Perera, Gampaha District Secretary and Home Affairs Ministry Additional Secretary Sunil Jayalath, Jaela Provincial Secretary E.M.S.B. Jayasundara, Provincial Council Members Srinath Perera and Nirosha Athukorala were also present.

Tamim takes blame for NZ series loss
Christchurch: Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal branded his side lazy after a batting implosion saw New Zealand cruise to a nine-wicket win in the second Test at Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Monday.
While Kane Williamson rated it New Zealands best day of the series, Tamim was bitterly disappointed with the way the Test was effectively over in three days after one day was washed out.
We all took the lazy option, he said, demanding improvement from the top down before they go to India for a one-off Test early next month.
New Zealand were left with a 109-run target which they knocked off in 18.4 overs after Bangladesh were all out for 173 in their second innings.
Tamim went cheaply for eight in the sixth over and after a brief period of consolidation Bangladesh lost five for 23 in the middle of the innings.
The way I got out was rubbish, a blunt Tamim said.
A few of the shots we played could have been much better. I take full responsibility. I take full blame for that because I started it.
The result meant New Zealand swept the Bangladesh tour -- winning the three Twenty20s, three one-day internationals and two Tests -- and moved them ahead of Pakistan to fifth on the world rankings. AFP

Thailands Chaipattana Foundation  opens agricultural programs to Lanka
For the first time Chaipattana Foundation, a project started by the former King of Thailand, Bhumibol Adulyadej, is opening up their sustainable based agricultural programs to Sri Lanka.
The centre is now inviting Sri Lankan students keen in agriculture and also Agri based companies to come and study at the Bhumirak Thammachart Centre in Nakhon Nayok and take out their knowledge and implement in Sri Lanka, said Thailand Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Nopporn Adchariyavanich.
He said that the Centre offer courses ranging from one week to one month where a student would get to study all ancient theories of agriculture that is still being put to successful use. He said that they also provide accommodation and all other facilities at the centre.
Panya Pulivekin, Director of the Bhumirak Thammachart Centre in Nakhon Nayok said that students from other countries come and study and they also offer a certificate to successful candidates
The Chaipattana Foundation is a non-government organization, operating in Thailand since 1988 that develops projects of national and social benefit to the Thai people.
In 1989, the Chaipattana Foundation bought a piece of land covering an area of 6 acres near Khun Dan Dam in Nakhon Nayok Province. Later the Vajiravudh College Alumni Association under the Royal Patronage was given permission to use this piece of land as a learning project for former Majesty, King Bhumibol's Concept of Development.
Some of the products sold at the centre.
Today, the Bhumirak Dhamachart Centre serves as a large museum which collects the concept and theories of the royal development project. It is divided into two parts including the Light & Sound Museum and the Living Museum.
While the former part is designed as a room of ideas behind key royally-initiated projects such the Royal Rainmaking and the New Theory for visitors to see, the latter part is designed as a farm displaying the real function of the ideas to promote better understanding about former Kings ideas for the royal development projects.
He said that today the centre is also a major tourist attraction and also a place frequently visited by students and agriculture schools.
He said that one simple theory introduced by the King was firstly to divide farmers land into 30-30-30-10 slots. "This means 30 per cent to pond or water reservoir, 30 per cent rice field, 30 per cent vegetable and fruit and 10 per cent to residential area."
According to the former Majestys theory, if farmers have water they will be able to grow enough rice, fruit and vegetables to feed their families, and may even have a surplus to sell."
He said that the Centre was created out of the King's concern to preserve nature near the newly built Khlong Tha Dan Dam, which is yet another brainchild of the former King. He said the former King said, "'Where there is forest there is moisture and where there is moisture there is rain. We must trap water at its origin by building dams, and then release the water for people to use in agriculture and this was how the dam came up in the area."
New techniques.
Picture by Sulochana Gamage
It was built in 2006 with an investment of 100 million baht with a dam of three kilometers long; the dam is 93 meters high making it one of the longest dams in the country. "This helped our project as well and it helped to create a new area with people who today are self sufficient."
Pulivekin, said that some of the simple sustainable agri theories can even be practiced at home. "For example if you fill a glass bottle with water tilt it at a 15% angle and leave it in the sun at 9 a.m. and take it exactly after 24 hours this water is very healthy."
Khlong Tha Dan Dam
He also said that puddles of water could also be blocked and kept to be sucked to the soil in the evenings enabling the earth to be moist all the time.
He said that the centre also treat human waste and convert them to electricity and the theory could be adopted successfully rural villages in Sri Lanka. We are ready to offer this technology to Sri Lanka."
Good soil is a very necessary resource for the agricultural occupation. Among former Kings various ways to improve the soil quality, there are two outstanding examples. The first one is the "use of vetiver grass" for soil conservation and erosion control. The use of vetiver grass has led Thailand to becoming one of the world's most successful and progressive centers for the application of vetiver grass technology for soil conservation and the erosion control. The success of this initiative has been recognized around the world, and led the International Erosion Control Association to present the former King, with its International Merit Award for excellent work as a soil and environment conservationist.
Some visitors to the centre.
We also have a Vegetable Oil Refining and Bio-Diesel Integrated Production Plant which has served as a model for environmentally-friendly bio-diesel production. "This research on biodiesel production from palm oil (a brain child of former King,) has been awarded with the gold medal at the symposium of Brussels Eureka 2001.
He said that that also use a leaves of the plant, (Stevia) in place of sugar.
The former King's development concepts, theories as well as inventions received several international acclaims. "One of the most recognized acclaims is the United Nation's first Human Development Lifetime Achievement Award presented by Secretary-General, Kofi Annan."
"Annan stated that former former Majesty is the world's "Development King" who has reached out to the poorest and the most vulnerable people of Thailand - regardless of their status, ethnicity or religion."
"We are ready to offer these techniques to Sri Lankan companies which could then implement for productive use."
The novel way of storing drinking water
He said that the people in the area were poor and somewhat under educated. "These farmers and the rural locals due to implementing these simple affordable and practical approaches and techniques are able to improve their resources in order to make ends meet and become self-reliant."
"Not only should the Thai people, the fellow global citizens too also be able to gain benefits from these projects. We have reached the international arena by creating collaborations with institutions in different parts of the world and Sri Lanka too can benefit from our research and development."
He said that this concept came in to sharp focus and demand during the Asian financial crisis which started in Thailand. Today I can say that the centre could house 6,000 people for six months at this centre and they can be fed with even river fish." (SS)

Trump pulls out of TPP trade deal

President Donald Trump has fulfilled a campaign pledge by signing an executive order to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).
The 12-nation trade deal was a linchpin of former President Barack Obama's Asia policy.
Great thing for the American worker what we just did, said Trump as he dumped the pact with a stroke of a pen.
He also cut funding for international groups that provide abortions, and froze hiring of some federal workers.
Trump's executive order on TPP was largely symbolic since the deal has not been ratified by a divided US Congress.
During his presidential campaign, he criticised the accord as a potential disaster for our country, arguing it harmed US manufacturing.
His action won some plaudits from the left as well as the right.
Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders told the BBC he backed it because trade deals like this have been a disasterand cost millions of jobs.
On Monday evening, Trump's pick to be secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations committee, and now requires confirmation from the full Senate.
And the new CIA boss will be Mike Pompeo, following a Senate vote of 66 to 32, in his favour.
What is the TPP
The trade deal, which covered 40% of the world's economy, was negotiated in 2015 by nations including the US, Japan, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Mexico
TPP's stated aim was to strengthen economic ties and boost growth, including by reducing tariffs.
It included measures to enforce labour and environmental standards, copyrights, patents and other legal protections.
The agreement, backed heavily by US business, was designed to potentially create a new single market likened to the EU.
Critics argued it was a not-so-secret gambit to box in China, which is not part of the agreement
The Trump administration's first weekday began with a flurry of executive orders, which allow the president to bypass Congress by issuing legally binding directions, mostly of limited scope, to federal agencies.
Trump also signed an order blocking foreign aid or federal funding for any nongovernmental organisation that provides abortions abroad.
The so-called Mexico City policy was first established by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1984.
It is typically rescinded by incoming Democratic presidents, including Barack Obama in 2009, and reinstated by Republican presidents.
Trump also signed an executive action placing a hiring freeze on non-military federal workers.
After meeting business leaders earlier at the White House, Trump pledged to lower corporate taxes to 15% or 20%, from the current 35%, and slash regulations by up to 75% if they keep jobs in the US.
Trump - whose protectionist rhetoric sent the US dollar falling - also met labour leaders later on Monday.
Some of the measures he announced on Monday fulfill Day One pledges he made as a candidate in a speech in Gettysburg in October.
But perhaps inevitably, some of the promises he made on that day and at rallies during his campaign have not been kept, although he may get to them in the coming days and weeks.
Some 'Day One' promises not kept
Begin building a wall along the US-Mexico border
Brand China a currency-manipulator
Eliminate gun-free zones in schools and on military bases
Ask Congress for legislation on strong minimum sentencing for illegal re-entry of a criminal
Terminate each unconstitutional executive order
Immediately suspend the admission of Syrian refugees into the US
The Trump administration has planned for a busy few weeks, according to the White House press secretary.
Sean Spicer said the president's nominee for Supreme Court Justice would come within the next couple of weeks.
I think the US is going to make sure that we protect our interests there, he said.
It's a question of - if those islands are in fact in international waters and not part of China proper, then yeah, we're going to make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country.

Unilever Pureit  launches islandwade awareness campaign  on clean drinking water
Unilever Pureit launched the Simple Water Challenge. This cleverly engaging activation began with a focus on thought provokingly educating the public about existing misconceptions around clean drinking water.
Conducted at the World Trade Centre Lobby, passers-by were presented with two seemingly identical glasses of clear water and requested to select the safe drinking water option from the two glasses. This was met with an array of responses and reactions.
When I was asked to select the clean drinking water glass, I realised I have always assumed that clear water equates clean drinking water.Now Im thinking about water more seriously, said Neel Indika Balasooriya who stopped to participate in the activation and took on the Simple Water Challenge.
Clean water is accepted as an intricate element of human health, well-being and broader eco-life. Despite this, there is a tendency to make decisions about cleanliness of water on subjective values like colour, odour (or lack of) and taste.
This launch was aimed at confronting the simple way we think about water to help people realize, Water is not as simple as we think.
The awareness campaign drew an enthusiastic response from the participants who were hitherto unaware of many of the sanitation and safety aspects of clean drinking water that were shared with them following the challenge.
This 2017, Unilever Pureit Sri Lanka launches into an island-wide campaign to raise public awareness about clean drinking water.
The Simple Water Challenge continued to key Lankan cities such as Kandy City Centre January 22 and Kurunegala on January 28 is carried out by Pureit, a water purification system by Unilever (Pvt) Limited.
Pureit is a point-of-use and in-home water treatment system and uses water purification technology that reduces harmful bacteria and parasites, which exists in drinking water.
Pureit is available in 14 countries and was a result of extensive research and development undertaken by Unilever to ensure clean and safe drinking water around the world through affordable means.

Warner wins Allan Border medal for second year
Sydney: Australias prolific opening batsman David Warner fought off a strong challenge from his captain Steve Smith to become just the fourth player to win back-to-back Allan Border Medals on Monday.
Only Ricky Ponting, Shane Watson and Michael Clarke have previously won consecutive medals in Australian crickets prestigious annual awards.
Thirty-year-old Warner recorded 269 votes over 248 for Smith and 197 for fast bowler Mitchell Starc. Fellow players, the media and umpires vote for player of the year. The Australian vice-captain also took the one-day international player award, while Starc was crowned Test player of the year despite missing half the period with injury. Shane Watson lifted the Twenty20 medal for a record third time thanks to 298 runs at a strike-rate of 150.51 as well as nine wickets.
Warner only emerged from what was a lean spell by his lofty standards towards the end of the voting period, which ran from from January 8 last year to January 7, 2017.
But he made up for lost time by smashing consecutive hundreds against Pakistan in Melbourne and Sydney this southern summer. Warner blasted the fastest Australian Test half-century off just 23 balls at his home ground, the Sydney Cricket Ground.
His 1,388 one-day runs was a world-high for the period and he scored 2,420 runs in total across all three formats. AFP

We are not key figures in govt: Harin
The key figures who brought victory in the last presidential election are not the leading figures who are running the Yahapalana government, Minister Harin Fernando said.
Minister Fernando was addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday. He said.
He said it is a group of outsiders who claim their dedication for the setting up of a unity government.
We are not key figures in the government. There is a new group at the front line. They are the ones who go around announcing their work and take advantage from the government, Minister Fernando said.
The ones who walked into the government on charity do not seem to hold the unity government in high regard, he said.
They may want the Yahapalana government to be unstable, he said. I have spoken at 98 political rallies in the Presidential Election campaign trail. Had Mahinda Rajapaksa won the election, our lives would have been in danger, Fernando said.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are on a solid understanding as to where the government should go. Since there is no dictator ruling over the governments decisions, it may seem there are many disagreements as many opinions are brought forth at discussions, Fernando said.
They are pieces of evidence of democracy and transparency with which the government is operating, he said.

Dead man opens his eyes and comes back to life
A dead elderly man has shocked his family when he sat up in his coffin during the funeral and asked them what was going on.
The pensioner, 75, had stopped breathing and had cold feet and hands when he was believed dead by his son, Huang Mingquan, and around a dozen other relatives.
He was already extremely weak to begin with and his family apparently thought he had finally passed away.
They were stunned when, eight hours into the mans funeral service, he opened the lid of the wooden coffin, sat up, and asked his children: Whats happening Are you preparing my funeral
He had seen the wreaths, ornaments, banners, as well as the gathering of relatives who had apparently all arrived to mourn his death.
The process would have continued for the next few days and carried on after his coffin had been put in the ground.
The mans kids rushed over to lift their old dad from the coffin and put him back on to his bed, apologising for the awkward mix-up.
The pensioner is still weak and not eating much.
He has now spent the past two days since coming back from the dead lying in bed and eating porridge.
The case occurred in Junlian County, in south-western Chinas Sichuan Province. Mirror

Govt should ensure quality of degrees by non-state institutes
The government has the responsibility to ensure the quality of the degrees awarded by non-state institutes in the country, Sri Jayawardenapura University Management Studies and Commerce Faculty Dean Anura Kumara said.
Dr. Kumara said the graduates of the Sri Jayawardenapura University Management Studies and Commerce Faculty are capable of pursuing a post graduate degree in any university in the world.
It is a yardstick to judge the quality of our degree programmes, he said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Foundation Institute on Friday before the commencement of the Annual General Meeting of the Alumni Association of the Management Studies and Commerce Faculty.
Dr. Kumara said there are two types of institutions that award degrees.
There is a set of institutions awarding degree with the approval of the University Grants Commission. Degrees are also awarded by a set of local institutions affiliated to foreign universities," he said.
University Vice Chancellor Prof. Sampath Amaratuna said the faculty was started by Most Ven. Welivitiye Soratha Thera 50 years ago.
The thera realised the need of having a faculty to explore management skills of Sri Lankans," Prof Amaratunga said.
The Faculty of Management Studies and Commerce of the University of Sri Jayawaradenepura is the first faculty in the country where degree programmes are available coving all subjects in the management feild. The faculty conducts 19 degree programmes in English with over 200 team of lecturers, he said.

Monologue with Art
Rohan Amarasinghe is one of the senior but lesser known Sri Lankan artists whose work has always been about politics'. He is a self-taught artist; a personality that claims an artist's identity outside of Colombo's art hierarchy which is constructed by the faculty and artist graduates from the IAS (Institute of Aesthetic Studies, currently the University of Performing and Visual Arts).
He has been actively participating in Colombo's art scene since mid 1970s. He is a regular participant in the annual art exhibition organized by the Art Council of Sri Lanka, and many a time his work has been rejected by the selection committee of this state sponsored sow for its explicitly radical nature. A regular presence at various exhibitions in Colombo, he is an avid culture buff and a latter day bohemian who makes his presence felt at a multitude of art and cultural events. Despite his long and keen, and at times combative association with the Colombo's art scene, the art community has been lukewarm towards his art. As such, he is still not acknowledged as a mainstream artist.
For us, Rohan Amerasinghe presents a prelude of sorts for the 90s trend. His importance as an art personality relies on his contribution to the contemporary or late modernist aspects of Sri Lankan art.
The purpose of this short essay is to endow Rohan Amerasinghe's work with some historical weight by positioning his art and artistic personality in the uncertain terrain that emerged at the modern/late modern interstice of late 20th century art of Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankan modernist art reached an important turn in the early 1990s. The artistic trend that gathered momentum in the early years of 1990s is now named the 90's Trend. The most noticeable aspect of the 90's Trend during its early years was its preoccupation with issues pertaining to violence and political crimes although it acquired so many other avenues and paths of expressions in later years. Consequently, some critiques of the 90's Trend called it the trauma school of art'. Nevertheless, what I would like to emphasis here is that taking violence and social injustice as points of reference for art making is not the sole purpose of the 90's Trend. But what needs to be underscored is that Sri Lankan modernist art already had a well established tradition of art making that had a political interventionist edge. However, this particular tradition was not as strong and popular as the bucolic and meditative trends of 20th century modernist art. This politically interventionist art tradition, which was an important sub tradition within the modernist discourse, could not develop to its full potential. It did not develop a relevant body of aesthetics that had the potential to define a paradigm shift in art within the modernist framework. The major achievement of the 90's Trend is to energize this political interventionist art tendency into a fully blown art movement with its own theoretical parameters of aesthetics.
Amerasinghe's artistic personality, I would argue, stands apart from the other two in several important ways. Unlike Sarath and Wijayakulathilake who as artist-personalities critique the establishment only through their art, Amerasinghe confronted the establishment both through his artwork as well as through is personality as an artist! While both Sarath and Wijayakulathilake are classical modernsit in terms of art thinking Amerasinghe was never so. He has always been consciously a narrative artist. He always has a story to tell which is more or less issue based. He has never been concerned with expressing a feeling, or a mood'. As can be seen in his work, he has never attempted to achieve a state of sublime in a modernist sense. His story and his restlessness are very much located in the now and here'. This aspect of Amerasinghe's art and artistic personality are the factors that make him an important artist in the transitional phase of 20th century Sri Lankan art from modern to late modern periods.
In many ways, he and his art pre-figured basic tenets of the 90s trend. This allows us to consider Rohan Amerasinghe as an important and serious contemporary art personality.
Amerasinghe characteristically is a very vocal personality. He has a magnetic attraction to pick up arguments and quarrels that can become long drawn debates on the meaning and function of art, artist personalities and art establishment. He engages in these quarrels/arguments in such a vocal manner as if he is demanding the attention of the society. But he has always been, in many ways, a loner with a very loud monologue'.

Retain majority stake in Colombo Port East Container Terminal: Ports Minister

Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said in Parliament today that he was of the view that the government should retain the majority stake of Colombo Port East Container Terminal.
He was responding to a question raised by JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa. 
The minister said the Government called for expressions of interests to invest in the East Terminal, but added the mechanism for that has not been decided yet.
He said even though a Cabinet paper was presented to lease out the East Terminal retaining a minimum of 15 percent to the Ports Authority, the government could up its stake by negotiating with the investor.
Responding to a supplementary question by JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake, the minister said he still stands by his initial position that the Government should hold 51 percent of the stake of the East Terminal.
East Terminal is very important to the Ports Authority as it is a deep water terminal to which deep-draught ships can enter. We presented a Cabinet paper last week to purchase cranes and it was referred to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Economic Management. We hope to start operations in the first 400m in the terminal using these cranes, the minister explained.
MP Dissanayake said Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) handle 34 percent of container operations of Colombo Harbour at present, while South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT) handle 28 percent.
He pointed out the share of container operations of the Ports Authority has dropped from 86 percent in 2001 to 38 percent now.
The MP objected for the proposal to go for long-term lease for the East Terminal, which was constructed at a cost of Rs 10,800 million, stating that the Government should start operations in it.

And the rest is uttered in detail
Prologue of First Utterance
The story of three men, deemed mad in a dystopian world, who shirk reality for dreams, music for silence and sanity for peace. Plunge into the myth and mystique of Mirage as the collective fate of these men brings a nation to its knees and heralds the end of time itself.
I am your lover for this eternal night;
In return for spiritual wage, I will offer my body whole to you:
My mouth for your hurried piety;
My bosoms for your gentle devotion;
My legs for your sanctification; and my womb for your seed
As you pour yourself whole - I long to be your grail this eternal night;
The mother of your patriarchs whose duty shall be to show them the one truth:
That in all colour and sound,
And in the eternal rhythm they are fated to march to,
You lie - and I am
Your Cosmic Mistress, your lover for this eternal night,
When our bodies moved in sync to primordial song;
But remember this as you take your leave now:
Your name will be banished to the mountain of lost memories,
While our progeny, this bastard blood line of yours,
will forever call me Mother Mirage.
He is a debut writer though with a strong presence online. Theena Kumaragurunathan enjoys a privileged audience which most budding English authors in Sri Lanka are deprived of. First Utterance, his maiden literary work, was submitted to a number of leading publishers only to be turned down. It fell out of the Gratiaen recognition as well.
Kumaragurunathan was not the one to give in that easily.
He initiated the arduous expedition of self-publishing. The publishers interests centred on well-liked themes such as ethnic conflict and Sri Lankas postwar struggle cum situation. Theena had not even got closer to such a coverage. That was quite a challenge  apart from being an English writer with a first appearance - in this small isle, but Theenas links with the corporate world came in handy. He chose the team he wanted, and things began to smoothen. The team of the right people worked on three aspects: cover, layout and the rest. Kumaragurunathans efforts were not in total vain, as the Fairway National Literary Awards 2016 recognised his work in its English Fiction category. It came to be featured on Huffington Post and other online platforms that matter.
First Utterance is a novella of short stories, three poems and a play ultimately connected to each other. Theena baptises that connection as Mirage. The reader is taken to the task of exploring the initial stages of Mirage.
Writing, especially in English, is not so professional in Sri Lanka. Most writers have a bit of a difficulty in striking a balance between their day job and writing as a profession. Hardly anyone would dare consider being an author as a profession. Kumaragurunathan shares an otherwise opinion. Being a son of a poet-turned-printer, Kumaragurunathan is a professional by day and a storyteller by night. Where does he derive inspiration for writing
Because I love stories - be they literary, visual or musical. The storytelling skill that I have some degree of talent for is writing. Thats why I write.
Striking a balance between night and day had been exhaustive. He almost left his day job in order to focus intensely on the pet project. Today he is happy that he did not. The busy schedule sharing time between his day job and writing the First Utterance only made him proactive on the path to become an established scribe.
That idea to write the First Utterance was born somewhere in September 2009. Then it took years to develop the fictitious region and its citizens. Until 2012, he had been struggling with the structure and its characters. That cast a huge challenge, as it was his first book. But then at one moment, he got the right idea on how and where to pilot his project. He did not let go of that moment of illumination. He logged out of Internet and had hours dedicated for writing, rewriting and editing. Following a number of minor revisions that his editor had suggested, the book finally made its way to the print in 2015.
A writers first publication is an announcement to the world that he has completed the first part of a long journey; he is gone from reader to writer to author. Long journeys are rarely undertaken alone  this is true both in the real world and in imaginary ones. Mine was no different, notes Theena at the end of his long-awaited pet project.
His path from reader to writer was very much inspired by a few books such as One Hundred Years of Solitude, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Heart of Darkness, House of Leaves, The English Teacher, Ficciones, The Glass Bead Game and Watchmen. Like any prolific writer who also happens to be an avid reader, Theena finds himself lost in the list as he can go on naming hundreds of more titles.
I read fairly extensively both fiction and non-fiction. I probably read more non-fiction. It is curiosity mostly. And everything else is detail, Theena observed his passion for reading and writing.
And who is his worst critic Probably himself. But thats a terrible cliche so I wont bore you with it, he added.
Looking back, does he feel as if he could have edited his first book
If you mean editing it more than I have already, before having it edited by two different editors thereafter, of course not. That would have only driven me crazy, he mused.
Theena Kumaragurunathan identifies the literary awards, like the Fairway National Awards, as a good platform for writers to announce themselves to the world. It will be nice to have validation for months of sacrifice from your peers. What I am concerned with is ensuring that literary storytelling continues to hold an important place in our cultural fabric. Those are the writers who have inspired me to take this journey that I am on, Kumaragurunathan said.
One interesting trivia in Theena Kumaragurunathan is that he cannot drive. Probably thats good for him, as it always provides him with an opportunity to read something when he is seated at the back of a tuk-tuk.
Theenathayalan Kumaragurunathans First Utterance was published on Marcy 27, 2016 as a paperback of 84 pages. It may not be the title you will likely come across in the traditional bookshelf. I dont think the book will have suitable extracts for you to reproduce, the author warned this writer before passing the portable document format of the copy. His writings may look almost utopian, or probably not. But that is fully up to you, the reader.
Find out what this up and coming writer, Theena, rejected by Gratiaen and a couple of publishers yet recognised by the Fairway National Awards, has to say in his maiden work. You will find a whole new world uttered in curiosity fused with detail.
Response from the Goodreads Readers
Theenas first book is a beauty. The density of its content, despite the succinct wordplay throughout, bursts through each word compelling you to invest all your attention in it. Multi-tasking or reading-on-the-go wont work with this, but given that you can finish it up nicely within two hours (three at the most, if youre a slow reader), the time isnt hard to come by.
- Aisha
Rarely I think has an authors first utterance come off as well as this, the first Miragian Cycle. Theena in his debut dares to tackle not simply fantasy or scifi or drama, but the realms of speculative fiction, magical realism. Genres mined to great depths by greats like Gabriel Garcia Marquez and depths to which First Utterance clearly aspires to. Does it reach them Yes. I think it does far more than it does not.
- Dilina
I was told to read the book without looking for a plot, and thats exactly what I did, letting the words wash over me, and leaving one story as I go into the next. Was I in awe No. But that is probably because I have issues with any material that involves prophets and religion as a fact (and I have no issue believing in Thestrals and Hippogriffs. Go figure). I liked this for the language. For the way parts of the book read like poetry. I liked this for the way different threads were seemingly left around, only to be tied at the end.

Another dengue prevention programme
A dengue prevention programme will be held from January 24 to 27 to assess the state and private organisations contribution towards the prevention of dengue, National Dengue Control Unit Director Dr. Hasitha Tissera said. He said special notices will be issued to the organisations based on their performances.
It is also mandatory for every institution to engage in dengue prevention programmes within their premises once per week continuously.

Assassins Creed : Game over!
The number of video game movie adaptations that have failed to meet expectations is astounding. Its as if Hollywood simply cant make the transition from console to cinema. Assassins Creed was touted as the one to break the curse, with big actors attached to the project like Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons. Additionally, the trailer looked promising with sweeping cinematography and complex action choreography which mimicked the frenetic pace and vast set pieces of the free-running, gravity-defying, time-traveling game series.
To its credit, the movie manages to accomplish that. Fassbenders Aguilar showcases lethal skills with his characters trademark concealed knives as he scales buildings and jumps across rooftops leading to some gorgeous fight sequences.
Intriguing aspects
The production design is appropriately detailed and the background score does its best to lend some emotion to the action. But instead of focusing on its most intriguing aspects - Aguilar and the assassins in the past, it chooses to invest more time in the present. The plot revolves around a device that is supposed to end violence across humanity. Exposition tends to be a distracting element in most films, but could have probably enhanced the story here  theres no explanation of how this device works and when we finally see it in action, its still baffling.
Power struggle
This detracts from an intriguing father- daughter power struggle between Alan Rikkins (Jeremy Irons) and Sofia (Marion Cotillard), which is the most compelling aspect in the films present. Even more so than the protagonist Callum Lynch/ Aguilar (Micheal Fassbender), whose motives arent made explicitly clear, therefore preventing the audience from being emotionally invested in his journey across time.
Hollywoods current obsession with franchise-building might act as a consolation for fans of the game series who might take a leap of faith in a better constructed sequel. Meanwhile, Assassins Creed becomes another exercise in squandering the considerable talents of its cast and crew.

The biggest game-based film franchise is here
Writer, director, producer and franchise veteran Paul W.S. Anderson returns to helm Resident Evil: The Final Chapter, the sixth and final installment in the most successful video game film franchise ever.
The improbable beginning of Paul W.S. Andersons fantastically successful, franchised motion picture adaptation of the Resident Evil video game reads like a Hollywood ending. Producer, Jeremy Bolt, who has worked with Anderson for 25 years and including all the Resident Evil editions, recalls, Back in 2002 we had just made a movie for Warner Bros. called Soldiers, which did not perform as well as wed hoped. So I went back to England and made a couple of small films, and Paul holed up in his house in Venice Beach where he played video games for 6 months. Out of the blue he called to say Ive been playing the game Resident Evil and we have got to get the film rights.
Since then, Resident Evil has grown to become one of the most successful game-to-movie franchises in the history of cinema, the first five installments in the franchise having grossed in excess of $1 billion worldwide and earning consistent No. 1 openings at the box-office. Thrilling fans of Capcoms original video game and action/sci-fi movie audiences alike, the movie franchise has built up a hardcore fan base in the millions and reputation of its own over the 14 years that it has enthralled audiences with cutting edge action and a continually novel approach to the sci-fi/action genre.
Bolt opines about the global success of the series. I think its the combination of style action and horror. It isnt a straight horror movie and it isnt a traditional zombie movie. It has a fantastical, and Sci-Fi element. I think Paul introducing the character of Alice made it different to the game so that when you go see one of these movies you dont just have to be a fan of the game to enjoy it, you get something extra which is the character of Alice. I think also we have a good villain in the evil and all-powerful Umbrella Corporation, its always a good villain to have that and totally relatable in the modern world. Inquirer
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter is due to be released at Majestic Cineplex from February 2. It is a CEL release

Boost for Lankas fish export with GSP+ trade concession
The restoration of the GSP+ trade concession will boost Sri Lanka's fish export industry, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
"The cancellation of the GSP+ facility to Sri Lanka saw a shortfall in the income based on fish export during the last few years," Amaraweera said.
He was addressing a special meeting with ministry officials on the GSP+ facility yesterday.
The minister said since the targeted national income was not achieved, the government was compelled to cut down financial allocations for development projects.
"International organisations are looking at Sri Lanka from a different angle thanks to the present government," Minister Amaraweera said.
The GSP+ trade concession offers much to the fish export industry as much as it does to the apparel industry, he said.
Minister Amaraweera also pointed out that with the GSP+ trade concession, a 15 percent tax concession is to be applied to Sri Lanka's fish export industry, with which Sri Lanka will see a significant rise in the national income.
Sri Lanka exported 13,932 metric tons of fish generating an income of Rs. 21,539 million. European Union countries purchased 1,817 metric tons of the total exported stock.
Tuna fish exports were 7,113 metric tons in 2016, of which 1,216 metric tons were purchased by EU countries.
Minister Amaraweera said with the 15 percent tax concession, Sri Lanka will be able to export more fish to the EU markets.

Britney Spears has opened up about her new man, calling Sam Asghari really cute in a new radio chat.
The pop star was on CBS Radios Fast in the Morning With Nathan Fast in Dallas, Texas on Thursday (19Jan17), when she was quizzed about her rumoured boyfriend - and she was surprisingly candid. Britney revealed she met Sam on the Slumber Party video shoot, adding, We were doing the scene where I was doing the walk scene through the hall to go through the door to go to the bedroom and we were sitting there and waiting and waiting together for like 20 minutes at a time. We were having to be literally stuck there together, so we were basically forced to talk to each other.
He has no idea..., she said.
I mean, he knows my name but he doesnt really know me as a person. Hes like, What is this girl like and I have no idea who the hell he is, you know We started talking about sushi and started talking about things we like and like we should go to sushi one day... and he said, OK, Ill give you my number after the thing. Britney admitted she waited a while before calling Asghari. I kept his number, and it was so weird - it was like five months later, and I found his number in my bag, she said, giggling. I was like, He is really cute. This guy is really cute. So then I called him, and ever since then, he is just a really fun, funny person.
The couple was first seen together in November (16) and on Friday (13Jan17), the singer shared a shirtless photo of the model and captioned the shot: Mad love for this one. Music News

The case filed against National Integration and Reconciliation State Minister A.H.M. Fowzie for allegedly causing a Rs. 1.07 million unlawful loss to the government by misusing a vehicle belonging to the Disaster Management Centre was yesterday fixed for trial by the Colombo Chief Magistrate.
The case was fixed for trial on April 5 and 6 by the Chief Magistrate. The first and second witnesses of the case were noticed to appear in Court on the next trial dates.
When the case came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the state minister was not present in Court.
The defence counsel appearing for the accused informed Court that his client was receiving treatment at the Colombo National Hospital. Presidents Counsel Shavindra Fernando appearing on behalf of the accused moved the Bribery Commission that its decision to frame charges against the state minister be re-considered ,since the charges levelled against the accused cannot be maintained.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed the corruption case against the state minister under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on four charges.
The Bribery Commission alleged that Fowzie had unlawfully utilised a Land Cruiser Jeep belonging to the Disaster Management Centre between 2010 and 2015, while he was serving as a senior minister during the previous regime.
The value of the vehicle was estimated at Rs. 19.5 million.

Chili peppers help you live longer
A red hot chili pepper a day might not be to everyone's taste. But now there's more reason than ever to put up with the heat and embrace the spice.
There could be a link between a love for spicy food and a longer life, says research from the Public Library of Science journal, PLoS One .
The US study reports that regular consumption of red hot chili peppers could extend your life by 13 per cent, giving the average Brit an extra 10.5 years.
It states that those who consume chilies are 13 per cent less likely to avoid dying early compared to those who avoid them.
More than 16,000 adults were surveyed based on their diets, background and health from 1988 to 1994. Then participants were checked up on over the next 18 years.
People who ate red chilies on regular basis had a mortality rate of under 22 per cent, while those that avoided cooking with them had a rate of over 33 per cent.
Some of the participants might have used red chilies to cook, while others may have bravely eaten them whole. But what apparently mattered was that they absorbed the special ingredient that gives spicy food its kick. Capsicum is the cause of both the chili's health benefits and its fiery bite, experts at PLoS say. This isn't the first time scientists have explored the healing effects of capsicum. Only last month, scientists from the Ruhr-University in Bochum, Germany, treated human samples of breast cancer cells with the peppery ingredient to find out more about their ability to destroy them.

Chinese warships tour Gulf Arab states for first time since 2010

Chinese warships began a tour of Gulf Arab states for the first time in six years while Beijing has expressed its desire to play a greater role on the international scene.
Chinas CCTV channel said three Chinese vessels, including a guided-missile destroyer warship, arrived in Qatars capital Doha on Saturday following a visit to the Saudi port city of Jeddah.
The Chinese navy regularly tours the world while its ships patrol off the coasts of Yemen and Somalia as part of international anti-piracy operations; however, it is uncommon that they visit Gulf Arab states, where both the US and Britain have naval bases.
The Chinese navy visited Iran for the first time in 2014 to participate in joint naval exercises with the Islamic Republic.
Beijing relies on the Middle East for oil, but it usually leaves Middle Eastern diplomacy to the other four permanent members of the UN Security Council  the United States, Britain, France and Russia.
However, China has been trying to get more involved, especially in Syria peace efforts, and has taken tentative steps over the Yemen crisis too.
A senior Chinese diplomat said Monday that Beijing could be forced to play a leading role if others step back from that position after US President Donald Trump pledged in his first speech to put America first.

Tender deposit non refundable
Tenders are called islandwide by private sector, semi government sector, boards, Municipal Councils, government departments etc. for the supply of goods and services.
It is reasonable to demand tender deposits both refundable and non-refundable (tender fee). The tender fee could include VAT and NBT according to the requirement. It is acceptable to request for Rs 1,000 (together with VAT and NBT). Regrettably, it is observed that tender fees ranging from Rs 2,200 to Rs 10,000 being charged by those organisations.
This is done according to the value of the tender. This is not correct. The tender deposits (refundable) could vary according to the value and not the fee which should be charged for the processing of submitted tender application.
It seems some boards, councils etc. are making money exploiting the high demand.
It is high time for the government to define a norm for tender fee for the public sector and keep it fairly reasonable. The private sector will follow that automatically.

Costa back to fire Chelsea to eight-point lead at the top
LONDON, Sunday - Diego Costa returned for Chelsea with deadly effect on Sunday, scoring in the 2-0 win over Hull City which increased their lead at the top of the Premier League to eight points after Arsenal had earlier taken up the mantle as their nearest pursuers.
The Gunners beat Burnley 2-1 at the Emirates where the real drama came in injury time when each side scored a penalty and Arsene Wenger clashed with the fourth official after being sent off for disputing the first spot-kick.
By contrast, the day's other game seemed routine, with Southampton beating the ailing champions Leicester City 3-0.
Chelsea are odds-on to succeed Claudio Ranieri's side as victors in May after posting their eighth successive home league win against a Hull side which had Ryan Mason taken to hospital after a sickening clash of heads with Gary Cahill. The stage was set perfectly for the returning Costa to make more headlines after being said by the club to be missing with injury against Leicester last week while British media reported he was unsettled by the prospect of a big-money move to China.
Manager Antonio Conte said before the game that he had been happy with Costa's mentality and he will have been even more pleased with the goal that put the Blues ahead in first-half injury time after good work on the right by Victor Moses.
The strike sparked a bizarre celebration in which the Spanish international made gestures with both hands that suggested he had just silenced the chatter about his future in the best way possible.
Indeed he had. Costa's goals -- this was his 52nd on his 100th appearance for the club -- remain the main reason why Chelsea are such hot favourites for the title as they now stand on 55 points with Arsenal on 47, Tottenham Hotspur on 46 and Liverpool on 45.
Costa eventually left to a rousing reception late after Cahill settled matters by rising above the visiting defence to head home the second on 81 minutes.
Now we have (a lead of) eight points and there are 16 games to play. I think me and my players have good experience to understand that in this league it will be very tough until the end, Conte told reporters. Across London, the goals came even later at the Emirates where the final minutes left the crowd -- and managers -- breathless. After the game's astonishing finale, which saw Alexis Sanchez net the winner in the 98th minute, a relieved Wenger apologised for his earlier clash with the fourth official.
However, Arsenal's manager may face an FA charge for appearing to push Anthony Taylor near the tunnel following his dismissal by referee Jon Moss after Burnley's 93rd-minute penalty had been converted by Andre Gray.
I didn't see any penalty from outside but I should have shut up and I apologise, even if I was frustrated, said Wenger. Gray's goal proved just the start of the action as referee Moss, who had already sent off Arsenal's Granit Xhaka for a wild 65th minute tackle, awarded the Gunners a penalty of their own when Ben Mee raised a leg to the advancing Laurent Koscielny.
Penalty-taker Sanchez possessed the only cool head in the ground, dinking the ball over the Burnley keeper to secure an astonishing win for Arsenal, who had taken the lead through Shkodran Mustafi's 59th-minute header.

Desperate to woo the west
While everyone has been talking about the sizzling chemistry between Deepika Padukone and Vin Diesel, off and on screen, there has been speculation about an affair between them.
In fact, in the US, the rumours have been flying fast and furious. Which is why when the actress made her debut on American television on the very prestigious Ellen Degeneres Show on January 17, the host asked her if there was any truth to those rumours. Deepika smiled mischievously and said, Well, there is no smoke without fire, is there She then added how in her head she is in a relationship with Vin Diesel and has amazing babies with him. The statements are shocking, given that she is in a relationship with Ranveer Singh.
One of her senior female colleagues succinctly summed up the situation.
Id like to ask her, would she like it if Ranveer spoke about having babies with a female co-star And would she speak about any male co-star from India in the same way It is a very indelicate statement to make. Why is she fanning the rumours instead of killing them Unless of course there is some truth to them.
A filmmaker who has worked with Deepika adds, Why this desperation to woo the west DNA

Disappointing exit for Nations Cup hosts Gabon
LIBREVILLE, Sunday: Hosts Gabon made a disappointing exit from the African Nations Cup on Sunday, foiled by the woodwork in the final minute as they missed out on the win over Cameroon which would have allowed them to grab a dramatic place in the quarter-finals.
Instead Burkina Faso and Cameroon advance from Group A, leaving Gabon with the ignominy of becoming the first home nation to be eliminated in the first round since Tunisia in 1994.
Burkina Faso topped the group on goal difference after a 2-0 victory over Guinea Bissau in Franceville on Sunday with a fortuitous own goal from Rudinilson Silva and a second-half strike from Bertrand Traore, the Chelsea striker on loan at Ajax Amsterdam.
Cameroon also finished on five points after the goalless draw with Gabon, whose three games were all drawn.
It is very sad for all of us but each player gave 100 percent, said Gabon captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who missed a glorious chance in the opening five minutes at Stade LAmitie in Libreville.
The hosts started furiously and finished with a late flourish that saw Denis Bouanga strike the upright deep in stoppage time and the rebound from Didier Ndong saved by Cameroons 21-year-old goalkeeper Fabrice Ondoa, who burst into tears at the end of the game as his team mates enveloped him in celebrations.
Cameroon now play Senegal in the quarter-finals but Burkina Fasos opponents will be decided when the standings in Group B are settled on Monday.
Senegal, already guaranteed top place, play Algeria in Franceville in a quarter-final on Saturday while Tunisia need just one point from their match with Zimbabwe in Libreville to set up a weekend meeting with Burkina Faso.
Burkina Faso went ahead early against Guinea Bissau as centre back Rudinilson put the ball in his own net in the 11th minute and Traore scored on the counter early in the second. But Guinea Bissau again proved competitive as they concluded their maiden appearance on the Nations Cup stage.
It is the first time that four-times winners Cameroon have progressed to the quarter-finals since 2010. Their success comes despite eight players turning down a call-up last month, leaving coach Hugo Broos with what he called a B-team for the tournament.
It is a young team that wants to play for the country, not just come because they have been called up by the coach. Now anything is possible, he said after Sundays game.

Dismissed Wenger apologises for clash with official
LONDON, Sunday: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger could face an FA charge after he was sent off and then clashed with fourth official Anthony Taylor in an astonishing finale to the Gunners 2-1 Premier League victory over Burnley at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.
Wenger, who became infuriated after the award of a 93rd minute penalty to Burnley, later apologised for his actions amid a frantic period of stoppage time.
Arsenal, reduced to 10 men following the 65th-minute sending off of Granit Xhaka, saw Andre Gray equalise from the spot kick only to be awarded a penalty of their own that Alexis Sanchez converted for a 98th-minute winner.
Wenger had reacted furiously to the first penalty, awarded after Francis Coquelin challenged Ashley Barnes in the box, leaving referee Jon Moss to send Arsenals manager down the tunnel where he appeared to clash with the fourth official.
Afterwards Wenger told the BBC: I didnt see any penalty from outside but I should have shut up and I apologise, even if I was frustrated.
Yet Wenger denied there was any physical altercation with Taylor. It was not physical. I just thought I could stand in the tunnel, he said.
Every week and every game is an unbelievable fight for everybody.
We finally got the win but of course it was very difficult for us. We couldnt get the second goal, we played with 10 men and they played well as well. In the end, we got the three points we wanted.
Burnley manager Sean Dyche, in charge for the 200th time, was equally unhappy at the award of Arsenals decisive penalty when Ben Mee raised a foot at the advancing Laurent Koscielny.
Dyche claimed the Frenchman was offside.
Its a tough day for us in the end, he said. To lose a game in that fashion, with an offside not given, is tough, particularly when you come to tough places like this.
We have never taken anything for granted. We know how tough this division is but you need officials to make the right decisions and that is the shame today.

Dr. Harsha keynote speaker at Standard Chartereds Global Research Briefing
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Harsha de Silva, will be the keynote speaker of Standard Chartereds Global Research Briefing 2017, exclusively for the banks clients today.
Deputy Minister commenced his career as the chief economist and treasurer of DFCC Bank and went on to become a successful entrepreneur who co-founded and built what is today the countrys largest market and social research agency; Nielsen Lanka.
He will undoubtedly set an extremely apt tone for Standard Chartereds economic researchers Dave Murray, Head, Global Research, David Mann, Chief Economist, Asia, Anubhuti Sahay, Head, South Asia Economic Research, Saurav Anand, Economist, South Asia and Priya Narain Balchandani, Energy Analyst who will present their views at the session.
Harsha de Silva, MP, served as Deputy Minister of Policy Planning and Economic Affairs from January  August, 2015 and was also the economic affairs spokesperson for the then opposition UNP.
After he his stake in the company he co-founded, Nielsen Lanka, he consulted with the World Bank, ADB, UNDP and many other multilateral agencies for over 10 years and with the think tank LIRNEasia in more than 20 countries. He was also visiting faculty at the Universities of Sri Jayawardenepura and Moratuwa for a number of years and has published widely on technology and development. He holds a PhD in economics from the University of Missouri and has had executive training at MIT. He was a 2011 Eisenhower Fellow.
The Global Research Briefing will focus on a world which has grown accustomed to central banks being the only game in town supporting growth; one in which low interest rates have prevailed for close on eight years.
However, the election of Donald Trump as the next US president is changing the global environment, and there are four major shifts to watch for in 2017: from a US-based world order to a multi-polar world, from fact-based politics to post-truth politics, from free trade to protectionism, and from monetary easing towards fiscal stimulus.
All four economists have visited Sri Lanka on previous occasions and their knowledge of ground realities will ensure meaningful insights into outlook for private-sector investment and trade given the Trump presidency in the US and Asias economic linkages to the US which are now weaker than they were a decade ago.

Ekneligoda Habeas Corpus petition inquiry laid by
The Court of Appeal yesterday decided to lay by the inquiry into the Habeas Corpus petition filed by the wife of missing journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda and his two sons.
However, the Court of Appeal ordered the Homagama Magistrate to proceed with the magisterial inquiry into Ekneligoda. On October 30, 2015, the Court of Appeal issued an order to temporarily suspend the magisterial inquiry (at the Homagama Magistrates Court) into Ekneligoda consequent to a requirement that arose in the Habeas Corpus petition.
The Army Commander and Director of Military Intelligence who had been newly named as the respondents in the Habeas Corpus petition had sought time to file objections in respect of the petition.
Accordingly, the Court of Appeal temporarily suspended the magisterial inquiry into the missing journalist until the objections were filed by two respondents.
On October 19, 2015, the Court had issued notices on the Army Commander and the Director of Military Intelligence to appear before Court in connection with the original Habeas Corpus filed by Sandya Ekneligoda and her two sons.
At a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal granted permission to the Homagama Magistrate to summon those added as respondent to the Habeas Corpus petition including the Army Commander and Director of the Military intelligence or other officers or agents acting under their direction for the inquiry and recording of such evidence as necessary for the magisterial inquiry.
Senior Counsel Chrishmal Warnasuriya appeared for the petitioner.
