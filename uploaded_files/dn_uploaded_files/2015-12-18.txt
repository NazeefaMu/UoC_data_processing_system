Arjuna says Director General of Sports action is a disgrace
Ports and Shipping Minister and a top candidate for the SLC vice-president's post Arjuna Ranatunga has described the Director General of Sports K.D. S. Ruwanchandra's action as a "disgrace" and blamed him for applying double standard of rules to different candidates contesting the forthcoming SLC election.
"There are many critics who are waiting to blame the Sports Minister, but those fingers must be pointed at these officials," said Ranatunga participating at the 30th anniversary celebrations of Ports Authority Childrens' School at the Ports Authority yesterday.
"If these officers do not perform their duties properly it is the Minister and the government who will be blamed by the public. That is exactly what's going on with the SLC elections," Ranatunga said.
The former Cricket World Cup winning captain said that he will inform the President and Prime Minister of the misuse of powers by the DGS.
"There is a mandatory requirement in the SLC constitution that for some posts a person should have served a minimum of two years in the Ex-Co. I am sure that some of the candidates have not fulfilled this requirement, but the DGS has accepted their nominations," noted Ranatunga.
"At the same time he has rejected some applications due to not fulfilling the same requirement. His conduct is unfair and has led to great injustice. It may be my party or Thilanga's party everyone has to be equally treated.
"The DGS should have been aware and inquired into these matters before reaching a final decision. His bad governance is a disgrace to the Sport Minister and the government. We feel sorry that even though we are also a part of the government, this kind of misconduct has occurred," Ranatunga further stated. AA

Canada shares 'Burden' of abuses towards natives - PM
CANADA: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized Tuesday to natives for more than a century of abuses at boarding schools set up to assimilate Canada's indigenous peoples, saying the burden of those experiences weighs heavily.
He was speaking to former students, chiefs and religious leaders at the unveiling of a final report on the schools, which left many boys and girls disconnected from their families, communities and feeling ashamed of being born native.
The previous administration officially apologized in June 2008 for the "cultural genocide," as part of a Can$1.9 billion (1.4 billion US dollars) settlement with former students.
It also launched a truth and reconciliation commission which urged Ottawa to increase funding for natives to address the disparity in academic performance with non-aboriginals.
Trudeau pledged to implement this and 93 other recommendations in the report to help repair the damage caused by the schools.
"The burden of this experience has been on your shoulders for far too long," Trudeau said. "The burden is properly ours as a government, and as a country.
"Our goal as we move forward together is clear: it is to lift this burden from your shoulders, from those of your families, and communities.
"It is to accept fully our responsibilities and our failings as a government and as a country."
Beginning in 1874, 150,000 Indian, Inuit and Metis children in Canada were forcibly enrolled in 139 boarding schools run by Christian churches on behalf of the federal government in an effort to integrate them into society.
Many survivors alleged abuse by headmasters and teachers, who stripped them of their culture and language.
At least 3,200 students never returned home.
The experience has been blamed for gross poverty and desperation in native communities that breeds abuse, suicide and crime.
Most of Canada's Indian Residential Schools were shut down in the 1970s. The last one closed in 1996 in Saskatchewan province.
Justice Murray Sinclair, a judge who chaired the commission and heard from 7,000 former students over a six-year period, said healing will take time.
"Change, of course, will not be immediate," he said. - AFP

UPFA MP Douglas Devananda yesterday asked as to why the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) had failed to fully utilise the financial allocations made to it by the Central Government. The MP was raising a question under the Standing Order 23 (2) in Parliament yesterday.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the Prime Minister would reply to the question at a future date.
MP Devananda observed that a greater share of the annual allocations made to the NPC in 2014 and 2015 had not been used and the money was directed back to the Treasury.
"Until the NPC was established in 2013, development activities were carried out in an expeditiously as the central government provisioned funds for them. Since the NPC was established as per the franchise of the people, it had failed to deliver to its people. Those in the NPC demanded to remove the Northern Province Governor and the Chief Secretary stating they cannot coordinate with them.
This request was fulfilled by the new Government and almost 10 months had lapsed since then. Now it is clear that this happens because of the inefficiency of the NPC. Other than corruption and fraud, recruitment outside the stipulated procedure and passing useless motions, the NPC does not do any work that benefits the people" he said.

Hate speech Bill's debate deferred
The Penal Code (Amendment) Bill and the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill will not be moved for debate on January 8, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said in Parliament yesterday.
He said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed him that the said two bills would not be taken up in Parliament on January 8 as previously scheduled.
The minister made this observation in response to a Point of Order raised by UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena.
MP Gunawardena asked the Government whether the two bills would be withdrawn. "There is marked opposition to these bills. About 22 civil organizations and almost all the MPs in the Opposition have demanded the Government to withdraw these bills," he said.
Minister Kiriella said a decision whether they would be withdrawn or not would be taken later.
Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake presented the two bills in Parliament on December 11.
The Penal Code (Amendment) Bill seeks to insert a new section 291c in Chapter 19 of the Act, as "Whoever, by the use of words spoken, written or intended to be read, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, intends to cause or attempts to instigate acts of violence, or to create religious, racial or communal
disharmony, or feelings of ill-will or hostility, between communities or different classes of persons or different racial or religious groups, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years".
The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill seeks to amend section 135 of the Act No, 15 of 1979 by including section 291c of the Penal Code in paragraph (e) of subsection 1, and the legal effect of the section as amended is to make the Attorney General's sanction a pre-requisite to take cognizance of an offense punishable under Section 291c.

IPL : Pune pick Dhoni, Rajkot go for Raina
MS Dhoni was the first pick for the new Pune franchise, owned by New Rising, and his Chennai Super Kings team-mate Suresh Raina was the first player chosen by Rajkot, owned by Intex, at the IPL player draft held in Mumbai.
The other four players chosen by Pune were Ajinkya Rahane, R Ashwin, Steven Smith and Faf du Plessis. Rajkots other choices were: Ravindra Jadeja, Brendon McCullum, James Faulkner, Dwayne Bravo. Both franchises will lose INR 39 crore from their auction purse, and will have INR 27 crore to spend at the auction in Bangalore to make up the rest of their squad.
All the other Super Kings and Royals players not picked in the draft will go into the main player auction in February. This player draft was necessary with the addition of two new teams for IPLs 2016 and 2017 to make up for the suspended Super Kings and Royals franchises. New Rising and Intex won ownership at the franchise auction earlier in December, and Pune having made the most successful bid got the first pick in the draft today.
There were very little surprises in terms of selection. Both teams went for Indian players and international heavyweights, although Shane Watsons exclusion seemed notable considering there was a rush for batsmen and allrounders. Ashwin was the only specialist bowler picked by either team. There were no fast bowlers chosen.
Fifty players went into the draft and the two franchises could pick anyone they wanted and ask for them. The first player set them back INR 12.5 crores ($1.86m), the next 9.5 crore ($1.42m), third Rs 7.5 crore ($1.12m). fourth Rs 5.5 crore ($0.82m) and the fifth Rs 4 crore ($0.60m).
These figures do not necessarily indicate the players full salary. It is only the amount deducted from Pune and Rajkots purse. All 10 men picked today will be paid the amount they were originally contracted for by the Super Kings or Royals.
Pune and Rajkot used up all of their allotment of five picks - seven players from Super Kings and three from Royals were chosen.

Lanka fancying their chances on Hamilton green deck
HAMILTON: Sri Lanka will be fancying their chances of knocking New Zealand over should they get an early chance with the ball on what is expected to be a green top pitch at Hamilton's Seddon Park, venue of the second Test beginning on Friday.
Captain Angelo Mathews said he wasn't surprised by the green wicket, especially after the wicket they saw in Dunedin.
"It got pretty flat after the second or third day," Mathews said.
"We kind of expected this to be a bit more grassy and some lateral movement. I think it's just a matter of getting our mindsets right."
Black Caps seamers Trent Boult, Tim Southee and Doug Bracewell will be fizzing to make the most of conditions at Hamilton. Should captain Brendon McCullum win the toss they know the ball will be in their hands bright and early with a favourable pitch and ideal conditions for swing bowling expected.
Vice-captain Kane Williamson said Hamilton offered up typical English conditions for the second test against Sri Lanka, with swing the likely difference maker as his team look to take 20 wickets for the second game in a row.
That means bowl first and make the most of a pitch with good grass covering, and no changes to the team from the previous victory over Sri Lanka.
"It's green. Dunedin was green, and we feel it might be more suited to seam bowling," Williamson said, adding that the team was picked based on the conditions as well as player form.
"A combination of both. I do think it's more important to look at the conditions - horses for courses, as they say.
"Every surface that we play on here starts out green. I think that it will be a good cricket surface but if it swings, that's when I think it offers more to the bowlers.
"We played a first class game here a wee while back before Australia and it was very green, but it was more the swing that did a lot, so if it's hard underneath it might just add a bit of pace to the surface. I'm sure it'll be pretty tough early on."
Playing on a wicket that hasn't been used for tests before, using Patumahoe clay that was added to the Seddon Park block only two years ago, there is an element of the unknown to the pitch.
But given the amount of grass on the wicket both teams were clear that with a win of the coin flip bowlers would be ready to roll their arms over.
For New Zealand that means no place for spinner Mark Craig. Craig was last sighted in the day-night test against Australia in Adelaide at the end of November, missing out on the Black Caps XI picked in Dunedin last week.
Mitchell Santner appears to have overtaken Craig in the spinners pecking order with assured displays in his first two tests, the first of which was the day-nighter in Adelaide.
It's early days, but Santner has taken six wickets in his two test caps at an average of 25.33 and an impressive economy rate of 2.48 runs per over. Craig averages 44.21 at 3.84 per over.
Instead of a Craig sighting, Neil Wagner will continue as New Zealand's fourth bowling option after a reminder of his qualities in the first test against Sri Lanka.
His efforts bowling hard into the dead University Oval wicket earned him five wickets, and a similar role may be required as the wicket browns off in Hamilton.
"It was a huge effort from the bowlers to take 20 wickets on that surface," Williamson said. "We know in Dunedin that it can offer a little bit for the seamers early on but it does tend to flatten out. That's probably similar to here." - Stuff

IS looking for oil targets beyond Syria
US: Islamic State(IS) is looking at potentially vulnerable oil assets in Libya and elsewhere outside its Syria stronghold, where the militant group controls about roughly 80 percent of the oil and gas fields, a senior U.S. official said on Tuesday.
The official, who briefed reporters in Washington on condition of anonymity, said the United States was carefully examining who controlled oil fields, pipelines, trucking routes and other infrastructure in places that could be vulnerable to attack.
Those include in Libya and the Sinai Peninsula, the official added.
"They are looking at the oil assets in Libya and elsewhere. We'll be prepared," the official said.
The United States has estimated Islamic State was selling as much as $40 million a month of oil, which was then spirited on trucks across the battle lines of the Syrian civil war and sometimes farther.
The United States recently targeted fuel trucks, part of a broadening of its strikes on Islamic State's oil wealth that the U.S. official said had showed anecdotal signs of raising the costs of Islamic State's oil operations. "The costs of the operation have gone up and the ability to move it around has gone down," the official said. Crude oil prices are barely above recent lows set during the depths of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Worldwide, oil prices have declined over 50 percent since they began dropping in June 2014.
Low oil prices could be a double-edged sword in the fight against Islamic State, helping reduce revenue the group gets in Syria but potentially accentuating vulnerabilities as companies elsewhere lay off workers. Some of the oil workers in Islamic State-held territory were foreigners, the official said.
"The reduction in oil prices actually adds another element of insecurity because companies have less money to spend on a variety of things," the official added. - AFP

Obama defends immigration as America's 'Oldest Tradition'
US: President Barack Obama launched a full throated defense of open immigration policies Tuesday, hailing them as America's "oldest tradition" amid a fierce election-fueled argument over the issue.
Hours before Republican candidates were to hold their final presidential debate of the year, one heavily focusing on security and immigration, Obama told 31 newly naturalized Americans that immigration is "who we are."
"Just about every nation in the world, to some extent, accepts immigrants, but there is something unique about America," he said in the National Archives rotunda, franked by the US Constitution, Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence.
"We don't simply welcome new arrivals, we are born of immigrants, that is who we are, immigration is our origin story," he said.
"For more than two centuries its remained at the core of our national character, it's our oldest tradition, it's who we are, it's part of what makes us exceptional."
The campaign to succeed Obama has been marked by tough talk against immigrants and immigration, not least from Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.
The real estate mogul-turned-politician has vowed to ban all Muslims from entering the country and to deport illegal migrants from Latin America.
The debate has taken on a tougher tone amid terror attacks in Paris and California.
One of the husband and wife attackers who killed 14 people in San Bernardino was born in America, the other had arrived on a fiancee visa.
Listing instances of past discrimination against the Japanese, Irish and Italians, Obama said, "On days like today, we need to resolve to never repeat mistakes like that again."- AFP

Political hypocrisy root cause of many problems - Dilan
Highways State Minister Dilan Perera told the Parliament yesterday that political hypocrisy is a root cause of most problems prevailing in the country and it is our duty to banish the political hypocrisy and work towards the betterment of the country.
He said so joining the Committee Stage debate on Budget Proposals 2016 under the expenditure heads of the ministries referred to the Select Committee.
"The ordinary people have no communal feelings and it is the politicians who whip up racial feelings and create troubles. "This resulted in the making of ruthless terrorist leaders like Prabhakaran. Now the time has come for all to get together and find a solution to the national question.
"It was in response to such concern, that we brought new legislation, Penal Code Amendment Bill. According to this, it will not be possible to denigrate any religion, community or similar groups. All the people, specially the Tamils and Muslims who voted for this government are waiting until a solution to the national problem is found.
"They hope that this consensual government can achieve a full stop to communalism and the hypocrisy. Hereafter, the SLFP will not aligned itself with any communalist or extremist political party," Perera said.
Thirty four persons convicted under PTA
Thirty four persons have been convicted under the Prevention of Terrorism Act due to their involvement in LTTE terrorism, stated a document tabled in parliament yesterday by Prison Reforms, Rehabilitaton, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan.
The document stated that there were 136 suspects in prisons while there were 10 appellants. Of the LTTE suspects and prisoners, the government had released 19 convicts, enlarged 67 suspects on bail and 42 had been sent for rehabilitation under the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation Bureau within the period from January 2015 to October 20, 2015.
The document was tabled in response to a question raised by UPFA MP Jayantha Samaraweera. The MP asked the minister to inform the House whether the government had taken a decision to treat the individuals punished for offences related to terrorist activities by the LTTE as political prisoners. According to the document there was no such category as political prisoners.
Rs. 108.2 m spent on certificate awarding ceremony - JVP MP
JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday revealed in Parliament that Rs. 108.2 million had been spent for an NVQ certificate awarding ceremony organised by the National Apprenticeship and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) in 2014.
The MP was participating in the Committee Stage debate of the Budget 2016 when the expenditure heads of nine ministries including the Skills Development and Vocational Training Ministry were taken up.
The MP said the ceremony was held to award certificates to 2,797 persons at Matara Uyanwatte Grounds on December 14, 2014 when the Presidential Election was at hand.
The MP said over Rs. one million had been spent to supply food while another Rs. 20 million was spent to purchase goods.
"Three dancing troupes had also taken part in it. When calculated, the government had spent Rs. 50,000 per person for the certificate awarding ceremony. Even the former NAITA Chairman was a coordinating secretary to former Minister Dullas Alahapperuma," he said.
At this point UPFA MP and former Youth Affairs and Skills Development Minister Dullas Alahapperuma refusing the charge, said that he had never appointed family members to any of the 18 institutions under his Ministry. "I have even not appointed a voter in Matara to any of them," he said.
MP Jayattisa said the total expenditure for a similar certificate awarding ceremony organised by the NAITA at Kurunegala Maligapitiya on August 2014 was Rs. 6.9 million. He said 500 persons working as masons participated in it.
He went on to reveal that the expenditure for a ceremony to lay the foundation stone for a NAITA Training Centre in Killinochchi on December 4, 2014 had been Rs. 4.6 million.
"Moreover, the Youth Affairs and Skills Development Ministry had spent Rs. 15.2 million for the Deyata Kirula exhibition in 2013. What was the benefit gained by the country by this spending Parallel to this Exhibition, the ministry had distributed 500 sports kits spending Rs. 6.6 million. It had spent Rs. 2.5 million to fix a screen at the exhibition premises and another Rs. 3.1 million for a stall of the National Youth Corps," he added.
The MP said according to the audit reports, "VTA Private Holdings Limited" established under the Vocational Training Authority (VTA) during the former government contravenes the Act of 1995. He said this move had not received the Cabinet or Attorney General's approval approval. He said the salaries of the director board of this institution were decided arbitrarily by the Chairman.
Time allocation a decision of Speaker
It is useless to accuse the Opposition Leader or the Chief Opposition Whip over the matters of time allocation in Parliament as it was a decision by the Speaker, JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa said.
The MP made this observation while joining in the Committee Stage debate of the Budget 2016, when the House took up the Expenditure Heads of nine ministries referred to the Select Committee.
Many government as well as Opposition MPs complained that they were not given a fair share of time to speak. As the House took up nine ministries together, the time was insufficient for members who took part in the debate as there was a lengthy list of speakers. Several in the UPFA Opposition group including MP Dullas Alahapperuma highlighted this fact demanding more time to speak.
MP Nalinda Jayatissa observing this fact noted that 65 percent of time is allocated for the government whereas the Opposition is given 35 percent of time as of a decision of the Speaker in accordance with Parliamentary traditions.
"The Opposition is consisted of TNA and JVP. If the UPFA group wants time allocated to the Opposition, they should officially declare that they will act as independent MPs in the Opposition," he stated.
MP Jayatissa commenting on the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry said all three languages - Sinhala, Tamil and English - should be treated equally as official languages. He noted Rs. 32.9 million of bills for transport, supplying food and other facilities for IIFA held in Sri Lanka in 2010 still remain unsettled.
"What is the benefit the tourism sector of the country received by holding it here This money should be charged from the Rajapaksas," he added.
Mobile phone jamming equipment for prisons
Mobile phone jamming equipment will be installed in all prisons from next year to prevent the use of mobile phones by prisoners, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan said in parliament yesterday.
This will be a solution for inmates carrying out underworld operations using mobile phones smuggled into the prisons. The minister said that such jammers had already been installed at the Welikada Prison and the results were significant.
"The inmates at Welikada are now unable to control 'operations' outside as they did in the recent past. The successful outcome compelled the government to fix phone frequency jammers in all prisons," he said.
Responding to a question by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana, the minister said that jammers would be installed in all prisons from next year.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayuake said that there was a difficulty in making and receiving calls in the parliament building. There is no problem of the difficulty within the Chamber but connectivity should not be disturbed outside the chamber, the minister said.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala said that he would bring the matter to the notice of the Speaker.
Over 400 visa violating foreigners in custody
Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S. B. Navinna told Parliament yesterday that 402 tourists on Tourists Visas and remaining in the country violating immigration laws were taken into custody this year.
The offenses for which they were taken into custody are as follows, propagating various religions and making illegal conversions, engaging in various professions and jobs and participating in anti-social activities. The tourists were from following countries: India (153) tourists, USA (4), Bangladesh (25), China (102), Pakistan (42), Thailand (13) and Singapore (11). Among them were three tourists who nabbed begging on the streets of Colombo.
The minister was responding to a question by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana. He said that 125 tourists were nabbed for overstaying the Visas, while 85 were arrested for engaging in various professions and jobs while remaining in the island illegally on Tourists Visas.
Around 145 tourists have wrongfully used their Visas while three illegal immigrants and two other tourists were apprehended for providing misleading information to the Department of Immigration and Emigration.
Special investigation unit has been set up to arrest the foreigners who remained in the country illegally after visiting the country on Tourist Visas.
UNP MP Pathirana asked as to how long it will take to process the completion of dual citizen applications. The minister said 2,400 passports were provided for dual citizenship holders last month while 2,000 passports will be issued for dual citizenship holders this month. "We will be able to grant dual citizenship for all those who have applied in 2016," he said.
Houses for Meeriyabedda landslide victims in January
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said in Parliament yesterday that construction of 45 houses for the displaced due to Koslanda Meeriya Bedda Estate landslide in Badulla will be completed by January next year.
He was joining the Committee Stage debate on Budget Proposals 2016 under the expenditure heads of the ministries referred to the Select Committee. "Today we are not in readiness to face any natural disaster. It is necessary to make aware the people on the prevention of natural disasters. We did not know until the tsunami hit us. Therefore, we have established 77 tsunami warning towers to provide early warning. The Department of Meteorology will be modernised using sophisticated technology, " the minister said.
Pension entitlement of 85 percent should cover all tri-forces personnel
The pension entitlement, upto a maximum of 85 percent, should be extended to the tri-force personnel who are not eligible for same, Parliamentary Reforms and Media Minister and Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunathilake said in Parliament yesterday.
The minister was responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake under the Standing Order 23 (2) on December 1.
The minister observed that about 10,600 tri-forces personnel who have not completed five years' service in operational areas, are deprived of this entitlement. The pension entitlement upto a maximum of 85 percent was given after the war ended in 2009 for the tri-force personnel who retire after 22 years' service.
The minister noted that 6,975 persons in the Army, 748 in the Navy and 2,877 in the Air Force were deprived of this pension benefit.
"Some of them had not completed five years' operational service as they suffered injuries in the war. Even those who served at VIP security units, special duties, intelligence services and army medical units are deprived of this benefit.
"Those who retired before the declaration of operational areas in 1983 were also denied of it. Some who were injured during the anti-government riots in 1971 and 1988-89 are also not eligible for it. Even the tri-force personnel in supplying divisions involved in supplying food and arms, repairing machines and administrative work do not get this pension benefit as they do not have operational service experience. Those in intelligent units and army women's corp who provided yeoman service to apprehend the terrorists who were planning to attack VIPs, public and important places in the hill country, Western and Southern Provinces and other areas outside the operational areas are also denied of this benefit," he said. "The service personnel manning radar and air monitoring centres, who operated UAVs and counter-attacked the LTTE air strikes, are not entitled for this pension. Therefore it is suitable to consider extending this pension benefit even to them as they have provided yeoman and dedicated service during the war," the minister said.

Sangakkara questions exclusion of Thirimanne
Former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara questioned why a player like Lahiru Thirimanne, Sri Lanka's one-day vice captain, wasn't included in the team to tour New Zealand.
"Unfortunately there are guys like Thirimanne sitting on the sidelines," Sangakkara told reporters in Hobart.
"Sometimes one-day cricket and T20 cricket overshadow test cricket, but at the end of the day if you're a cricketing nation you want to have the best test-playing side out there in the middle."
Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews clearly respected what Sangakkara had to say. "Different people have different opinions," Mathews said. "Obviously, Sanga is one of the [biggest] legends that we've ever had.
"Sometimes as selectors, you know, as a team, you do [make] mistakes. You've got to rectify it and move forward. "It is what it is, what we've got is what we've got at the moment, we can't [make] any changes now. It's going to be a one off test where we have to give it our best shot, play our best team and try to win."
Sangakkara did have praise for Dimuth Karunaratne and Dinesh Chandimal for their efforts in the first test, and there were many more positive signs from the young Sri Lankan lineup in Dunedin. Mathews is hoping to build on that in Hamilton, and said the team will be out to get a result. "It doesn't really matter if we lose 2-0 by trying to win this game," Mathews said.
"We have a very good chance. It's just a matter of applying ourselves while batting and putting the runs on the board and then give our bowlers a chance to try and bowl them out."
