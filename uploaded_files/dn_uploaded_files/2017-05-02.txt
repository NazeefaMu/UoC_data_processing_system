En Route to The Great  American  Song Book - vol 2'
Fans of American popular music of the early and mid 20th century have an event to look forward to and a date to keep.Colombos popular Jazz outfit En Route led by Saxophonist cum Vocalist Gananath Dasanayaka will perform live in concert The Great American Song Book  Vol 2 on May 27 at the British School Auditorium from 8 pm. This will be the Bands third concert following the much acclaimed Tribute to Sinatra in December 2015 and Volume 1 of The Great American Song Book in September 2016.
Though not quite certain and anxious of the audience response, Gananath and his talented band of musicians took the plunge in paying tribute to Frank Albert Sinatra on his 100th Birth anniversary on December 12, 2015. Their anxiety was unfounded. The concert delivered to a packed auditorium was a resounding success. Particularly to those such as the writer, starved of live music of the 1940s and 50s, the evening was an oasis from which to quench a long felt thirst. The repertoire included many popular Sinatra standards rendered by Gananath with panache and so ably supported by the versatile Band.
The legend Ol Blue Eyes himself would have been delighted to know that a group of musicians far away from his adopted home in the USA, paid tribute to his class and style before a highly appreciative audience in a packed Colombo auditorium in celebration of the centenary of his birth.
The success of the Tribute to Sinatra encouraged En Route to broaden their canvass. It resulted in the first presentation of The Great American Song Book in September 2016. The Great American Song Book also known as American Standards is described as the canon of the most influential American popular songs and Jazz standards from the early 20th Century. A selection of songs from this genre sung by Gananath and backed by flamboyant musicians including Maxwell Peirterz on double bass, Debbie Arnolda on Piano, Niroshan De Silva on Drums and Ramesh Nonis on guitar, left the audience bewitched for a full hour and fifteen minutes. Dilip Senewiratne on the organ as a guest artiste added to the lustre of the show. The songs ranged from Swing Ballads to spirituals, including New York, Mack the Knife and Ol Man River. The evening also brought back memories of the Rat pack days with a Dean Martin and Sammy Davis look a like joining Sinatra in song and laughter to a readily responsive audience.
Encouraged by its successful foray into big band Jazz En Route now present their 3rd concert building on the theme The Great American Song Book.
The repertoire for the evening will include among others, Somewhere Over the Rainbow by Judy Garland, Sinatras standards such as Summer wind, Lady is a Tramp, Ive got you under my skin and Dean Martin hits Amore and King of the Road.Proceeds of the concert, as in the case of the earlier one, will be donated to the Music Project an approved charity, to help less affluent Sri Lankan children enhance music skills.

Finance Ministry brings about pioneering initiatives to benefit workforce
The Finance Ministry in a media release issued on May Day stated that it has been at the helm of several pioneering initiatives to benefit the workforce, the lifeblood of this country, .
One such initiative it brought about was the provision in the Governments 2016 budget to grant the Rs. 10,000 allowance to the basic salary of all government employees. The Ministry carried out this in accordance with the Presidents manifesto declared at the 2015 Presidential Election, which promised to initiate measures to improve the living and working conditions of State Sector employees to their satisfaction, thereby improving efficiency and boosting productivity. The budget also requested private sector employers to grant a Rs. 2,500 salary increment to all its workers. The Ministry was responsible for stabilising and then reducing the cost of living. Ggas prices were slashed to less than Rs. 1,400 for a 12.5kg cylinder, bringing much needed relief to Sri Lankans island-wide.
In keeping with the governments election promise, the Ministry reduced the price of petrol, diesel and kerosene to Rs. 117, 95 and 65 respectively, which has remained unchanged for over 2 years, leading to significant reductions in transportation costs. In its fight against the scourge of drugs which plague the youth of the country, Minister Ravi Karunanayake had the foresight to set up the Rapid Deployment Unit and empowered the squad to identify large scale drug dealers and importers as well as illicit liquor smugglers. This has led to a string of arrests of high level drug importers, as well as the confiscation of contraband amounting to billions of rupees.
The Ministry created the Natural Disaster Insurance Policy, established for the first time in the world as confirmed by the World Bank, to insure the long-suffering workers in these two industries against natural disasters ruining their livelihood.
The Ministry is engaged in several more development initiatives as well to benefit the nation as outlined in its overarching budget. As all workers of the country celebrate May Day, the Ministry pledges to uphold the commitments it has made towards them, the heartbeat of our nation.

JVP will not allow another ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka
The JVP shall not allow another ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka,JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said. He was addressing the May Day rally at the BRC grounds, Colombo yesterday.
Dissanayake pointed out that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is trying to regain power by creating a false alarm about the return of terrorism to Sri Lanka. Rajapaksa is spreading racism and religious hatred to regain political power back, Dissanayake said.
Patriotism does not mean the spreading of racism among different ethnicities, which in exactly what Rajapaksa is doing, Dissanayake pointed out.
After stepping down from the Presidency, MP Mahinda Rajapaksa is still to do an analysis of the countrys economic plight ,nor has he made any remarks about the fragile situation the country is in, Dissanayake further said. His only method is to inflict fear upon the people that the LTTE will raise its ugly head again. Rajapaksa also trying to create a friction between the Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim people,the JVP Leader alleged.
However, the JVP will assure that it will not in anyway allow the separatists to raise their heads again,Dissanayake said.
Dissanayake further said, the Wickremesinghe-Sirisena government has a gloomy future and the JVP is awaiting a great political leap to give the necessary leadership for an independent and reconciled country.
The May Day celebration and rally held for the first time in Jaffna by the JVP is a great exemple of national reconsiliation, he added.
Dissanayake pointed out that the two mainstream political parties in Sri Lanka should be responsible for the countrys economic plight.
We are at a debt crisis. We are not producing. We have privatised our production sources. We are in a situation where we cannot pay our foreign debts in the coming four years. Therefore, do you really believe these two mainstream political parties have the right to govern usDissanayake asked.
Speaking on the SAITM issue, Dissanayake said there are certain groups who have an agenda to close down national universities. He said in 2015,2,200 undergraduate vacancies have not been filled. He said the rulers always try to deprive the working class of the right to education.
Dissanayake also said the 70-year-rule of main stream political parties should be held responsible for making the Sri Lankan nation a subservient one and for making Sri Lanka a beggar in the international arena.
We have become so enslaved by globalisation that, no responsible institute regarding foreign workers can give statistical data as to how many Sri Lankans are employed in foreign countries, Dissanayake also pointed out.
He also challenged the government to cut taxes from the Employees Provident Fund against which the JVP is to launch a large scale resistance.
Dissanayeka also said the rulers need rules, or else they will not rule the nation properly.

Speaking at the TNA May Day rally in Akkaraipattu in Ampara, Sampanthan said a lasting solution to the national question was imperative for the countrys future socio-economic growth.
He noted that the opportunity arisen through the decision made by the two main parties in the country to form a unity government should not be missed to find a lasting solution to the national issue.
The Opposition Leader added that this opportunity should not be missed to propagate peace and reconciliation among all people and uplift the marginalized and the downtrodden in society.
Addressing a large gathering, Samapanthan said the Tamil people should unite if they want to find permanent solutions to the issues they face.
He added that until the Tamil people remain divided, they will face difficulties in finding viable solutions to their problems.
Speaking about development in the North and East, Sampanthan said politicians in the two provinces should work together when taking crucial decisions.
He also called on foreign countries to help develop the North and East economically and create jobs for youths in the two provinces, and uplift the living standards.

Army continuing work at Meethotamulla to prevent future catastrophe
Sri Lanka Engineer (SLE) troops of the Army still at work in Meethotamulla to prevent any future recurrence of a catastrophe or a garbage-slide in the area.
They have now begun to erect a solid soil-bund bordering the remaining heap of garbage. They are draining away underneath polluted water, laying huge drainpipes (hume pipes) as a durable drainage system, and continuing to measure emission of methane gas.
The work was supported by the recently-raised Army Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Response Squadron, Sri Lanka Land Reclamation & Development Corporation (SLLR & DC) and other technical experts.
The troops work under the guidance of Army Chief Field Engineer Major General Dananjith Karunaratne on the directions of the Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Crisanthe De Silva.
After the troops completed covering mounds of garbage with polythene to resist rainwater since it could aggravate any water-based chemical reactions inside the heap, Army Engineer troops succeeded in unearthing a huge and long underground drain that remained buried totally under piles of rubble. It was subsequently cleared and restored to drain away polluted water using submersible motor pumps, thereby reducing water levels that would develop to be a mini-flood after cautious troops dug the location and laid more than 150 drainpipes as a long term initiative.
The ongoing construction of a soil-bund surrounding the garbage dump by Engineer troops was also another alternative to ensure that no any eventual garbage-slide would occur again or further expand perimeters, exposing resident civilians to more risks.
The CBRN Response Squadron, which saw its birth recently as a conceptual notion of the Commander of the Army to meet with any catastrophic chemical emergencies or challenges, has been continuously monitoring methane levels, arising naturally out from the garbage heap as another precautionary measure on the directions of the Chief Field Engineer of the Army. Lieutenant General Crisanthe De Silva. A special Sunday (30) afternoon meeting presided by the Army Chief Field Engineer at the location fully reviewed all preventive and precautionary measures that have so far been put into effect by Army Engineers and servicemen since the Day 1 of the disaster.
The Chief Field Engineer during this gathering spelt out the remaining workload and other follow-up phases, needed to be effected without any further delay.
The meeting was attended by several foreign officials, Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau officials, Disaster Management Centre officials, Sri Lanka Land Reclamation & Development Corporation officials, Brigadier Amith Seneviratne, Engineer Brigade Commander and Major Sanjeewa Assaddumegedara, Commanding Officer, and 5 Field Engineer Regiment.

## Title: Boost human capital

Boost human capital
Many countries love to boast about their economic strengths. Many of the countries in the global economic landscape largely based around the Gross National Product (GNP), to show their growth rate. There is, however, an overlooked non-economic indicator, namely, the Human Development Index (HDI). Any nations strength lies on the Human potential of the labour force of that country.
HDI is derived from the theme of Human Development, which is fundamentally about enlarging individual choices. The theme was formed by Mahbub ul Haq, a Pakistani economist who worked with the well- known Indian economist Amartya Sen. In Ul Haqs, Sens and their colleagues view, economic indicators did not fully describe the state of a country. They argued that in place of economic indicators should be human-centred indicators focused, on widening human choices. Ul Haq thus wrote the first Human Development Report in 1990 and created the HDI to quantify Human Development. HDI and Human Development Reports rapidly shifted the global development arena.
They emphasized on the strength of the human capital and helped shift donor nations attention towards human needs and also slightly helped formulate global goals such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and their successor, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Development should be about people rather than about digits
Human development is not a widely known or utilized concept in Sri Lanka. Many of the Sri Lankan organisations still rely on the financial and pure economic-based measurements for economic growth. However, HDI shows that progress and development should be about people rather than about digits. Many of the private and public sector organisations in Sri Lanka follow the digits rather than potential of the Human factor. Many of the statistics in the public and private sector do not reveal the strength of the Human capital and the potential lies within such an asset. Therefore, organisations lag behind without reaping the benefit of strength of human capital in their organisations.
Innovation and entrepreneurship in a country which drives the way forward emanates from the human capital. Innovation and entrepreneurship are the keys to any nations future. Book smarts will only take a person so far. There are only so many traditional careers and job types known to the present generation. The majority of students today must be groomed in the art of learning, assimilating and using knowledge and honing skill sets so they can be flexible enough to capably work in professions yet unknown to us at this present.
The global employment market
The global employment market is an increasingly competitive place. Asians would strive to go West for better educational and work opportunities; but there seems to be a turnaround over the last decade where many Westerners are looking to come East. They go to places like China, India, Hong Kong and Singapore to explore burgeoning opportunities, with China leading the way by attracting close to half a million foreign students, third after the U.S. and UK. As well, Western workers are looking to China and Asian tigers for employment experiences to embellish their resumes. Singapore is a highly service-driven economy, hungry for foreign workers at all levels of the skills spectrum. Getting a work permit is easy enough if you have the right skills with such an open market.
HDI brings about a moral dimension to development, showing peoples opportunities can be improved, especially through components such as increasing access to education, improving the health of the human capital. As we move on with local or global development goals, we need to emphasize on human development construct rather than towards economic targets.
Harnessing the human potential to cater to the development process of the country has been the key area discussed. In Sri Lanka, youth, those between the ages of 15-29, account for nearly 26% of the total population in the country. As Sri Lanka move towards a transition to an upper middle income economy, many of the changes driving modern economies up the income ladder, such as technological innovation and globalization, will immensely benefit the skilled and educated youth of the country. However, it is imperative to ensure that they are being provided with the necessary skills and resources to improve their capacity to engage in the development activities of the country.
Despite Sri Lanka being on track in achieving many of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), further attention should be given to youth development, supporting them to overcome the challenges including unemployment, poverty and educational dilemmas, and help them seize the opportunities in the global arena. Therefore, Sri Lanka needs to mindfully address the many constraints faced by the youth to fully integrate them in the political, economic and social continuum of the country.
Most of the Y-generation in developed nations has been given ample opportunities to secure a well rounded education as well as access to some form of relevant work-ready training. They should by all accounts, be equipped for some form of skilled employment. In many South East Asian countries when a job requiring a specialized skills set is advertised in the newspapers, prospective job seekers based anywhere in the world may look at the advertisement and apply for the job. It is a competitive, global work market indeed. Sri Lanka needs to think the way forward in giving ample opportunities to the Human capital of this country to enrich their lives as well as skills and knowledge to serve this country.
Sustainability of the health-care and social support systems
Investment in re-skilling retirees is one alternative to go. While Japan, the US and Britain are focusing much of their attention on the sustainability of their health-care and social support systems to enable their silver generation to live comfortably, Singapore is encouraging its mid-career workers and retirees to upgrade and re-skill themselves (with up to 85% funding from the government) to take on higher-skilled work or second careers. Fifty years ago when the life expectancy in the nation was pegged at 66.7 years, it made sense to expect retirees to enjoy their life without having to worry about how they were going to afford to maintain their not-so-expensive lifestyle for a decade or so. Today, life expectancy in Singapore is one of the highest in the world at 84.7 years. This translates to almost twenty more years of life, a generation in fact, much of it still very productive.
Government with the private sector partnership need to craft a well recognized rewarding system to strengthen the potential of the human capital of this country. The pioneer generation of citizens, personalities who placed our mother nation in the world map with dignity, Tri-forces who dedicated their lives to serve this nation are few examples need to be rewarded with well-subsidized medical care, public housing as well as means-tested cash supplements. Public and private sector organisations need to enhance the provision of health insurance and housing schemes, increase more access for training and development on appropriate skills and knowledge of the human capital of the respective organisations. Maintaining equity and equality in the aforesaid provisions are really important to sustain the human potential within the organisations. The percentage of marginalized citizens will be then minimal in this island nation.
Necessity of National Think Tank
In order to express the views and opinions of the human capital on development with the aim of creating a positive change in the country there is a necessity of a national think tank. Many of the positive ideas could be considered for the development of this country. If we do not identify the potential of human capital of this country, it will lead to many socio-economic issues that many of us are currently facing. The future of this country greatly depends on the current and its emerging workforce. There is an ever growing population of young minds who find them wanting to use their skills to pursue careers in various industries However, are there opportunities available for them within the country currently, and if not, are there policies being set in place or steps being taken to do so Smartest, brightest people leaving the country crisis where the brains of the nation are not contributing anything to the country or its future, and there is a huge flow of cash out of the country.
If policymakers and corporate could see the potential of the workforce and adequately have opportunities available for them, the end effect could quite literally take Sri Lanka to new heights.

Call of love
Shooting that particular scene was difficult. This movie project was an ambitious one and had too many hurdles to overcome. First, it was the location. The film had to be shot at the National Institute of Mental Health. No inmate could be noticed in a single scene. Even if they give their consent, it will not be deemed suitable, given their mental condition.
The solution Casting a new group of inmates.
But then again, the issue of doing cinematic justice to the real life phenomenon loomed large. Vindana Ariyawansa and Kalpana Ariyawansa had to overcome several such challenges in producing their creative debut, Premaya Nam.
The chosen cast had to visit the institute several times in order to study the inmates behaviour. The stories learnt, behaviour closely studied, and finally, the cast was ready to breathe life into the crux of the film. It narrates a tale about a man who suffered from a mental condition called Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), one of the four commonest mental disorders found among the human species on this planet. A person suffering from this condition is burdened by obsessive thoughts which result in compulsive behaviours.
Kalpana and Vindana Ariyawansa
It affects men, women and children and can develop at any age, according to a general description online. Some people develop the condition early, often around puberty, but it typically develops during early adulthood. OCD can be distressing and significantly interfere with your life, but treatment can help you keep it under control.
Shooting the scenes without inmates was successful to some extent.
There was one elderly person. He was full of fun. Whenever we say action, this grandpa somehow poses to the camera from distance. That is the blurred image you see.
The grandfathers entrance has even instigated a note in the IMDB as a goof.
After relieving himself, Vishva, the lead character, cannot help but go for a shower. He is constantly troubled by the thought that the liquid has contaminated his body and clothes. Throughout the film (except for the last scene), Vishva keeps his hands above the waistline. Slow but steadily, this phenomenon takes a heavy toll on his life. His wife leaves him to his own devices. His boss forces him to quit his white collar job. His parents told off by his parents in law. Finally he visits the hospital himself in search of a remedy. But medicine disillusions him. He is left without an option, until he finds the only option left.
Before the credits appear on the film, the audience is warned: the film is based on a true story. And that true story belongs to Vindana Ariyawansa. It could be perhaps for the first time that a person who suffered from a mental disorder had the guts to film his own story. But Vindana chose not to perform his own character.
You never feel bad for a fat guy. Thats why I did not act. But I worked with Shyam to sharpen the sense of authenticity. Sometimes I acted out certain scenes myself to show him the actual me, Vindana explained.
Ariyawansas first challenge was to destigmatise the stigma created around mental disorders.
Except for the final scene, everything including dialogues happened just the same way in my life, Vindana states.
It is not the medications that helped him overcome the condition. Medications can serve only 15 percent, and the rest is up to the person. You should have a defence mechanism to fight the condition. What was Vishvas defence mechanism It is none other than the much-adored L word: Love. Pushed by that powerful emotion, Vishva succeeds in building up his defence mechanism to overcome his mental condition.
My father suggested making a film based on my idiosyncratic behaviour. He strongly believed that it will generate some interest in people.
And Kularatne Ariyawansa was just right. Beginning from the Beijing Film Festival, the film shot to stardom in Hollywood, to the much surprise of Ariyawansa brothers.
In Sri Lanka, of course, we can expect this film to be a trendsetter. But we were surprised to find interest shown for this film in places where there is a good awareness about mental illnesses.
Vindana has left no stone unturned in his life story to make this film. Even though most films are based on true story they usually extract the influence and add much imagination. On the contrary, Vindana was privileged with full liberty to convert his story, in almost entirety, into a motion picture.
The final scene was changed deliberately as Ariyawansa brothers believed in hope for humanity.
People are anyway plagued with quite a lot of burdens in life. We should not overburden them in a film. That is why we decided on a reunion for the final scene. It will inspire people to react positively to any kind of mental disorder, Vindana keeps fingers crossed.
They had a lot of facts to ponder. The plot is based on a personal love story, for one. And they needed to syringe authenticity into the plot as much as possible. The theme is a new concept to the contemporary spectacle.
Unlike physical ailments, the mental sicknesses are not visible. We have so many mental disorders. Most such disorders lie deep beneath without affecting our lifestyle. The problem is when they surface and affect our lifestyle, Vindana explained.
Medicine could not offer a proper cure to Vishvas mental disorder. The cure came from within. That is where Vindana rests his hope  for he believes love has the power to cure.
In real love, Vindana believes that sacrifice is much easier. You cannot complain about all the things you have done when the other party falters in returning your love. He cites Alexander Pushkin to define  or redefine, perhaps - love.
I loved you once: perhaps that love has yet
To die down thoroughly within my soul;
But let it not dismay you any longer;
I have no wish to cause you any sorrow.
I loved you wordlessly, without a hope,
By shyness tortured, or by jealousy.
I loved you with such tenderness and candour
And pray God grants you to be loved that way again.
In such kind of love, you do not feel pained anymore. Premaya Nam bursts with inspiration to encourage such kind of love.

MEETOTAMULLA CARNAGE AND ELECTRICITY FROM GARBAGE
While in parliament debates on the carnage at Meetotamulla, where our parliamentarians will accuse one another, exposing their own sins in wasteful expenditure on unwanted projects such as the Mattala Airport, International stadium at Tanamalwila, all undertaken on huge foreign loans, and not addressing their minds to matters of national importance, the Chairman Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Engineers Union Athula Wanniarachchi in a recent news report says, The projects initiated to generate electricity from garbage were unsuccessful due to the high cost of production and the difficulty in producing electricity from garbage with the huge humidity of the garbage available
It also states CEB had agreed to purchase a unit of electricity produced from garbage for Rs.23.10 against the price of Rs.35.00 set by producers. This statement from CEB is acceptable as it is a commercial establishment, but on national interest, the government and the Colombo Municipal Council should have worked out a mechanism to meet the balance with the four entrepreneurs which the authorities appear to have failed. On the aforesaid statement of the Chairman CEB Engineers Union on the pricing, I scanned the internet where it says as reported in an English Weekly of April 10, 2016 captioned CEB GENERATES INTO BUYING PRIVATE POWER Director Development of the Ministry for Power and Renewable Energy Sulakshana Jayawardena, under this scheme suppliers will be paid Rs.31.85 for every unit of electricity generated to the national grid. The payment will be subjected to generation of electricity during two specific periods 6.30 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. It will be seen the price offered to those entrepreneurs who were prepared to undertake power generation using garbage and the private suppliers with diesel plants seems to be almost same, but why has the CEB offered a lesser rate of Rs.23.10 for garbage produced electricity.
The other damning statement made by the Chairman CEB Engineers Union Athula Wanniarachchi is the difficulty in obtaining necessary Licenses for these projects. It will be interesting to know who was responsible to issue licenses and why it was not done. The answer is obvious.

## Title: Colombos other problem
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial

Colombos other problem
A lot has been written about recently on Colombos garbage problem. But there is one other problem that is equally unhealthy for Colombo. The city is bursting at the seams, unable to cope with the chaotic traffic situation.
On an average weekday, one million people enter Colombo by 30,000 buses. An equal number of people use more than 500,000 vehicles to enter Colombo daily. Most private vehicles have only one or two occupants. This is an almost criminal wastage of fuel and money, not counting the effects on the environment. The result is chronic traffic congestion, as all types of vehicles battle for limited road space.
What if at least one-third of these vehicle occupants give up their cars and come to the city by bus or train There will be much less traffic congestion. But for this to happen, the buses must be far more efficient, punctual, comfortable and clean. If the buses can go faster than other vehicles, that in itself will be a major draw.
This was the main aim of the priority bus lane project introduced a few months back in Rajagiriya, which is essentially an experimental Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. This project turned out to be a success and the Cabinet had approved the proposal made by Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka to expand the Priority Bus Lane concept further and to take action to attract more people to use public transport services.
Accordingly, Bus Priority Lanes will be implemented in Moratuwa-Ratmalana, Wellawatte-Kollupitiya on the Galle Road and from Parliament Junction to Rajagiriya, Borella, Maradana, Pettah and Colombo Fort along the Parliament Road. The concept is also likely to be put into practice from the roundabout in Chittampalam A. Gardiner Mawatha to Pettah, Thummulla Junction to the Museum Junction and the Eye Hospital Roundabout to the Thummulla Junction during busy hours.
This is a very pragmatic proposal. With the Cabinet giving the nod to promoting the import of Low Floor air-conditioned buses through concessionary loan schemes and preparing a common ticketing system with electronic card payment facilities, all the ingredients are present to attract a good number of motorists to a nascent BRT network. Air-conditioned buses and convenient payment methods are a must to attract the car-loving city workers.
Sri Lanka is late to the BRT party. In a proper BRT system, buses can actually use the left lane of the opposing side of the road to pick up and drop passengers at centre island bus halts. It is essentially a train system without the trains, with all infrastructure such as terminals and stations, gates, sidewalks, warning and direction signs, and pedestrian crossing facilities.
Many countries, even developing ones, dedicate a separate lane for buses at least during the rush hours. This speeds up the flow of buses and also allows other traffic to move without being hindered by buses which usually hog all lanes. In some countries such as Singapore the bus (and train) network is so good even without a proper BRT system that most people do not think about buying a private car. This should be the eventual goal of our transport planners too.
Sri Lanka already has more than six million vehicles, from just one million vehicles as recently as year 2000. If current registration trends continue, the country will have 10 million vehicles in the next 10-15 years even amidst a high duty and tax structure. The majority of them will still be fossil fuel powered. Being a net importer of oil, our fuel bills will soar as a result. We will indeed be able to save a lot more foreign exchange and minimize traffic snarls if more people opt not to buy private vehicles in the first place. However, this will never happen if the local public transport system is not improved by leaps and bounds. The proposed seven electric Light Rail Transit (LRT) lines (with some interchanges that interconnect at least two lines) into Colombo and the BRT system are likely to entice motorists who will appreciate their comfort and convenience. This is more likely to succeed than several failed initiatives in the past such as park and ride.
Developing public transport is essential if we are keen on reducing traffic congestion. Exports have already expressed fears that traffic could crawl to just 3 Km/h on roads leading to Colombo in a few years (at present vehicle registration rates). Everyone aspires to buy a vehicle, at least a motorcycle, because public transport options are limited and inconvenient. Comfortable, safer, punctual and cleaner public transport is the key to reducing the craving for private transport.
But there could also be an alternative answer. Ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft are already making it possible to live without a private car. Driverless car technology is progressing at a rapid pace and they are likely to be commonplace by around 2030. You will be able to summon one through an app, input your destination and get off. Between the LRT/BRT and car-on-call, who will really need a private car

ComBank's Paymaster pays record Rs 11.6 billion in three days
More than 2,500 institutions paid out Rs 11.6 billion in early salaries and bonuses over just three days in April 2017 via Paymaster, the sophisticated bulk payments platform of Commercial Bank.
The Bank said that April 5,6 and7, Paymaster processed a total of 375,666 electronic payments on behalf of these institutions, with 53% of the beneficiaries being account holders of Commercial Bank and the rest customers of other banks.
On two of these days, April 6 and 7, Paymaster dispensed more than Rs 9 billion to nearly 300,000 recipients in an impressive demonstration of its capacity, the Bank said.
Paymaster enables organisations or individuals to make virtually any type of payment to multiple beneficiaries by simply uploading a file to Commercial Bank's online platform. There are no limits to the number of transactions and if the paying party and beneficiary both have accounts at Commercial Bank, the transfer of funds is virtually instant.
Widely used by companies to pay employee salaries, commissions and numerous other payments to their suppliers and customers, PayMaster was upgraded in 2016 to offer a dual and multilevel authorisation module for bulk payments, a User Administration facility and a shared log-in feature for group accounts.
The new version also supports payment of interest and dividends, agent commissions, insurance claims, bulk utility payments and statutory payments to the Employees Trust Fund (ETF) and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF).
The record disbursements prior to the Avurudu holidays reaffirm that Paymaster has become the bulk payment platform of choicefor many businesses and institutions, Commercial Bank's Chief Operating Officer S.Renganathan said.
It is the benchmark for reliable and speedy large-scale payments, minimising transaction time, costs and the risks associated with the physical handing of money.

Cowgirls in India..!
Even as Indian newspapers scream about rapes and assaults on women happening with increasing frequency, and the fairer sex feel more and more insecure to step out of their homes, in a country where male chauvinism is learning to aggressively flourish, thankfully the Holy Cow is moving out of the confines of its shelters, and being found in increasing numbers, boldly feeding in garbage dumps, strolling fearlessly on the middle of roads and literally nuzzling its way into every nook and cranny of the crowded country, as they have now been made a protected species!
Videos of foreigners being beaten up by locals, because they shoed a nosy cow from rummaging through their picnic baskets, is doing the rounds. The government is also issuing a unique identification card for every cow throughout the country, so no one messes with these four legged creatures who are revered as gods.
Priests are being asked, how their followers can become cows in their next birth as it seems to be much more lucrative than being born a human once more.
Womens organizations have started showing interest in the fact that this cud chewing animal is now safer than they are in India!
Its certainly better being a cow than a woman! said a representative of one of these groups, In fact we are wondering whether we should design and create cow masks and distribute it to our lady members all over the country, who feel unsafe while returning from work, at their workplace or maybe just wear it all the time!
I dont know about wearing cow masks! said a political leader, but somehow I like the idea of women being equipped with long cow tails!
You mean tucked into their sari asked a TV journalist.
Either tucked, or wound round their waist, said the politician thoughtfully, just imagine, in one twist and twirl weve made women safe! All they have to do when facing hostile men is unwind their tail, and they will be treated like goddesses!
Not to be outdone, another Protect your Woman association has made a phone app that when pressed starts mooing. They can even press it in the middle of a conversation they are having with an aggressive male! said the app maker, It will go off like a siren. We are sure this Moo Movement will be an overnight success!
Meanwhile cow vigilantes; men who roam the country, protecting the bovine creature, are not too happy with all these cowgirl measures, We cant waste our time running to protect a woman who is mooing, or someone wearing a cow mask, who is being attacked, they said with disdain, Our duty is to protect holy cows, not ordinary women! We are not interested!
So, let us watch and wait, and see what other methods the poor women of India employ to be safe in their country.
Maybe wearing protective horns could be a better alternative to moos, masks and tails..!

Danger of methane eruption at Gohagoda dump eased

The danger of methane eruption at Gohagoda garbage dump site has eased with the rains in Kandy on Monday, Peradeniya University Geological Department Prof Athula Senaratne said.
After the rains, the moisture content has gone up and temperature inside the dump has lowered. This will result in less methane generation and therefore there will not be a methane emission as experienced a few days ago, he told the Daily News
Prof Senaratne said he would visit the Tekkawatta garbage dump in Gohagoda today for further studies. The gas smell in the area is still very strong. Various gases like Methane, Ammonia and Hydrogen Sulfide are found inside the dump he added.
He also said the possibility of landslides are found at least at three places of the garbage dump, adding that the officials of the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) were probing to ascertain whether there is an imminent danger.
Asked about the landslide risk, NBRO Landslide Research and Risk Management Division Director R M S Bandara said, Possibilities are there, but we are yet to determine whether there is any imminent danger. The NBRO is conducting studies and will make our official recommendations later.

Dusit to open new hotel in Bangkoks renowned Chatuchak Market
Dusit International, one of Thailand's foremost hotel and property development companies, has signed a hotel management agreement with Dhanasansombut Development Co., Ltd. to operate the first ever hotel in the heart of Bangkok's famous Chatuchak Market.
Forming part of Dhanasansombut Development Co., Ltd's new mixed-use development, Mixt Chatuchak (www.mixtchatuchak.com), the new hotel will comprise approximately 250 rooms and is strategically located a short walk from both the MRT (Mo Chit Station) and BTS (Chatuchak Station) mass transit rail systems, which provide easy access to all of Bangkok's main attractions. Don Mueang International Airport, which serves key domestic and regional destinations, is 30 minutes drive away.
Chatuchak Market, also known locally as Jatujak or JJ, is located in the north of the city next to Chatuchak Park, one of Bangkok's largest green spaces, and near Or Tor Kor, recently named one of the world's best fresh markets by CNN.
Comprising over 8,000 stalls selling everything from clothes and furniture, to art, ceramics, plants, souvenirs, drinks, food and even pets, JJ is one of Bangkok's top tourist destinations, attracting more than 400,000 shoppers every weekend. It is estimated that six out of every 10 tourists in Bangkok will visit the market during their vacation.
Bang Sue Grand Station, which will replace the Bangkok Railway Station at Hua Lamphong as the terminus for all long-distance rail services from Bangkok, is also currently under construction next to JJ Market and is scheduled to open in 2019. The new station will be surrounded by several new commercial, business and residential projects.
JJ Market is a true Bangkok icon and we are delighted to have this opportunity to become part of its vibrant fabric, said Suphajee Suthumpun, Group Chief Executive Officer of Dusit International. With several exciting developments set to open near the market within the next few years, the area will only become even more appealing, and our new hotel will be perfectly positioned to meet the needs of the young, sophisticated travellers who visit the area seeking a distinctive localized experience.
Nontaya Apitanotai, the majority owner and Authorized Director of Dhanasansombut Development Co., Ltd., said, Mixt Chatuchak is the only building located directly within JJ Market, making the mixed-use project and Dusit's new hotel a unique proposition for guests who will benefit from the large array of shops and services within our building as well as on their doorstep.
Our companies share a complementary vision to impress the world with Thai hospitality, and by drawing on the energy, culture and vibrancy of the iconic JJ Market, we are confident this synergy will be a huge success.
With 29 properties currently in operation across four brands in eight countries, Dusit International is in a significant growth phase which will see the number of Dusit properties reach 70 within the next three to four years across Southeast Asia, China, sub-Saharan Africa, the GCC region, Europe, and more key markets.
Dusit International recently became the first hotel operator in Thailand to to accept WeChat Pay, which allows Chinese guests to pay their hotel bills via the mobile e-payment platform initially at Dusit's owned properties in Thailand, and soon its other properties around the world.

## Title: ECONOMYS  DIGITAL POINT
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Tuesday, May 2, 2017 - 01:00
ECONOMYS  DIGITAL POINT
The global economy has undergone many transformations in the last decade and half. A notable feature of this new economy is the emergence of a number of new digital products or services that have to a great extent changed the lives of people all around the world by strengthening communication and facilitating trade.
Many of these new products are IT or internet based and created by a whole new generation of self made billionaire entrepreneurs such as Jeff Bezos (Amazon.com) Jack Ma (Alibaba Group) Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) Larry Page and Sergey Brin (Google) and Travis Kalanick (Uber). Captains of industry and innovators are increasingly drawn from sectors that are linked to goods and services that have an IT or Internet base.
Age of the digital economy
Because of the growing importance of this type of product to modern lifestyles they have been often shown as indicators of a new economic era, the age of the digital economy. This claim and others in disagreement are the basis of a very interesting debate which will be the subject of this article.
There is considerable confusion today as to what really constitutes the digital economy and perhaps as a starting point we need to understand that it is not separate in any way to the existing economy. What is referred to as digital economy is in reality a transformation or mutation of the existing economy with the introduction of new technologies. But is that really the case
Prof. Joseph Stieglitz, Professor of Economics at Columbia University and Nobel Laureate in Economics stated that new technologies have transformed the nature of competition, of marketing and how we collect taxes. He added that this represents the foundation of how the economy works.
Digital technology
It is indeed true that the global economy as well as that of individual States, including Sri Lanka, has to a great extent been reshaped by the advent of digital technology. However, experts generally hold that the economic impact of the digital technology has not been as significant as it is often claimed. In other words technology inputs have transformed the market but it remains fundamentally unchanged.
It has in fact been argued that when compared to vital historical technological advances such as electricity, the automobile and the aircraft, the introduction of digital technology has lagged behind in terms of the impact and social changes that it has resulted in.
Leading economists such as Stieglitz have in fact argued that a leading and widely used web search engine is just a better advertising agency rather than being on par with what he describes as earlier fundamental transformations.
However not everyone shares this perception and this earlier opinion has been disputed by Economist Eli Noam who believes instead that products like the IPhone, I Pad and services such as Uber are all innovations in their own right and unlike anything else that has existed before. According to Noam the global economy has taken a radical new turn.
Another important issue is the economic usefulness of technology. The general view of economists is that if advances in the digital economy have the ability to generate new and sustainable employment or impact significantly at a global level on humanity, then they can be considered positive.
Global events
In the USA in particular, there has been considerable research in what is known as the economics of information. Information flows have increased and changed lives, perceptions and to a large extent the outcome of global events. But can a real value or worth be assigned to them
In the past, news organisations marketed news and advertising as a joint product. However now advertising was entered a new dimension, namely online platforms. This can be called the decentralization of information. At a recent visit to Galle Fort a particularly helpful waiter at a restaurant requested this writer to praise the quality of his service on Trip Advisor. By this request the young Sri Lankan waiter had indicated that he wanted the whole world to be aware of this excellent service and he considered his clients to be the global travelling community.
Technological advances have resulted in a considerable lowering of the cost of news and information. However there is also a concern that information that has no cost may also have no value. The real problem today is not a shortage of information, but seeking out what information is really worthwhile accessing and using.
A central issue about knowledge is how it is valued. Knowledge is in general considered a public good which can be shared, but that also needs to have a return on its original investment. In the digital age, knowledge is widely disseminated but many problems and much discussion exist on how best this knowledge can be monetized. Perhaps we need to see people as recipients of knowledge and determine the true value of this knowledge.
The lowering of the cost of information is likely in the long term to reduce the distance between the people and the market. Perhaps the long term global environment for innovation and information will be one where ideally all the people will have access to all the information in the world.
This would mean the emergence of a truly globalized economy with exciting new prospects for the individual as well as for developing nations, such as Sri Lanka.

Former Kolonnawa UC Chairman considers leaving politics
Kolonnawa Urban Council former Chairman Ravindra Udayakaantha is contemplating to leave active politics in the face of allegations circulating against him, to safeguard his good name, the good name of his family and his children.
Addressing a media conference at his residence, he said that some envy the stand he has taken, to follow the policy of the Good Governance Government the Yahapalana government, led by President Maithripala Sirisena and supported by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Allegations from political parties and environmentalists claim that I have accepted bribes from lorry drivers and others working at the Meethotamulla garbage dump to prevent it from being cleared up, he said.
I have not taken a single cent, but I know that there are politicians, state officials and CMC officials that do. I challenge them to prove that I have taken money, he added.
Udayakaantha said, I am not a rich man, but I am fully aware that the people appointed me to the UC to serve them. If I had collected money, people would know it, because they know that I have been with them at every turn. They trust me, and I will do nothing to breach that trust.
He added, garbage collection has become a National issue today. The best is to bring viable projects to resolve this issue without giving into meaningless protests by the three-wheeler groups.
People fail to realize they are taken for a ride by cunning politicians with ulterior motives. What the government should do is, implement the good and viable plans to minimize the danger at hand and completely wipe out the menace. The people have to be convinced that the governments pure intention was the welfare of the polity they represent.
If the government takes steps beneficial to the masses, those staging protests would turn their protests into campaigns promoting governments movements.
That is what the people expect from a responsible governmentnot to shelve the good plans in the face of opposition, but to implement them instead and silence and send to limbo, the prophets of doom, he added . Udayakantha also said that instead of appreciating what he did to minimize the danger of the issue as the then Chairman, now a group with ulterior motives sling mud at him.
Making reference to the erosion of the man-made garbage mountain in the year 2012 and the flooding in the area in the year 2016, he said, the people who received his assistance and relief when they were in dire need of help, appreciated it. They expressed their gratitude for the steps he took to save their lives.
Recalling the very recent disaster experienced by the families at Meethotamulla, he said that his timely action had saved the lives of more than 20 families living very close to the garbage hill.
Udayakantha added, Having received the information about the imminent danger, while I was at a funeral house, I went to the very spot and almost forcibly, got them move, as some were reluctant.
Today, they show their gratitude with smiles. If not for that immediate action, more lives would have been lost.
Udayakantha had a word of appreciation to the Commissioner of Colombo CMC V.K. Anura for acting swiftly to save the lives of the people at Meethotamulla, on his request.

Has Commanders Cup golf delivered the wrong command
The Sri Lankan golfing fraternity was baffled with a recent ruling by the Tournament Committee when the best score winner of the Commanders Cup 2017, Tyron Perera was not awarded the trophy with a surprise announcement being made by the compere during the presentation ceremony, stating that only members of the RCGC, NEGC and VGCR are eligible for it.
Perera is a fully paid member of the Eagles Golf Links, a club that comes under the wings of the Sri Lanka Air Force, the organizers of the championship.
The event was concluded at the Eagles Golf Links, China Bay, Trincomalee on January 14 where Perera emerged winner with the best score of 36. The trophy was awarded to the runner-up with a score of 31 points. It was revealed that the Air Force Commander had stipulated that all Air Force personnel playing in their own tournament have been exempted from winning any trophy.
As all Air Force and other military men were invited by the Air Force Commander to play free for fun at the tournament, such a ruling may be rational for non-paying military men. But Tyron Perera and some other genuine fee paying non Air Force full time members of the Eagles Golf Links who paid the tournament fees and spent big amounts of money (approx. Rs 50,000 each) to attend the tournament were highly disappointed by this post-tournament ruling, which they claim was highly unacceptable in the sport of golf.
Perera emphasized that according to the rules of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club in Scotland (R&A), the authority of international golf, no rule can be introduced after a tournament of golf which did not exist prior to the game, that the players were not informed before the competition began. Further a local rule that modifies an established practice in golf must be authorized by the R&A before it is implemented in a competition.
Perera also claimed such a clarification about eligibility was never mentioned in any document related to the tournament, not in the invitational flyer, nor in the confirmation and final details provided by the organizing committee.
Perera submitted an appeal to the tournament committee which is to be directed to the R&A through a committee member in charge of the competition for a ruling by the world governing body, which he claims as the R&A procedure over a suspected breach of an established golf rule at a tournament. But the tournament committee did not proceed with Pereras appeal to R&A, instead they autonomously reaffirmed their initial decision in a final verdict, stating the matter is considered closed and the committee will no further correspond in this regard.
In that letter from the tournament committee head, Sirath Kasturiratne, with return address of the Air Force Commander justified their decision with four reasons:
1. As in the previous years, Commanders Cup 2017 was open only to NEGC, RCGC and VGCR golfers with an authentic handicap.
2. Air Force Commander invited three Forces members with or without a handicap to play free for fun, without being eligible to win and you fell into that category though you are not an invitee, nor a member of an eligible club.
3. Vandalizing the room provided by the organizers for a player during the tournament is irresponsible and unacceptable.
4. Tournament conditions clearly stated that the committee decision related to all matters is final.
Showing the invitational flyer, confirmation of registration, thanking letter for entry fee payment and copy of the accommodation plan, all issued by the Eagles Golf Link secretary, Perera claims he was accepted for the tournament and questions if he falls to the free and fun playing category, why did the organizers accept his tournament fees, which they could have refused due to his ineligibility initially. He also emphasized the fact that eligibility restriction was not mentioned in a single official document before the tournament.
Perera expresses surprise over the vandalism accusation which was brought against him after nearly four months if it had happened. He also questioned why the organizers did not take action to recover the damage on the spot or by lodging a complaint with the Police as vandalism is a criminal offence.
Perera says the whole drama is a disgrace to the gentlemens sport and he hopes that the Sri Lanka Golf Union and Sports Minister will intervene to do justice and preserve the high standard of golf in Sri Lanka.

Higgins leads Selby 10-7 in world snooker final
SHEFFIELD, Sunday: John Higgins upset the form book to lead title-holder Mark Selby 10-7 in the World Championship final on Sunday.
Selby, bidding to win his third world title, found himself 6-2 down against four-time champion Higgins come the end of the first session at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, northern England.
But with the showpiece match a best of 35 frames contest, comebacks from large early deficits are possible -- as Dennis Taylor proved when recovering from 8-0 down to beat Steve Davis in a black-ball finish in the last frame of the 1985 final.
And Selby, perhaps the toughest match-player in the game today, duly fought back, with the Englishman winning the final three of the day in a match that will be played to a finish on Monday.
Nevertheless, it was still an impressive start from the 41-year-old Higgins, bidding to become the oldest world champion since snooker great Ray Reardon won the last of his six titles aged 45 in 1978.
The Scot, playing his first world final since he beat Judd Trump six years ago, was quickly into his stride and a break of 141 in the fourth frame saw Higgins displaying all his old class.
Contributions of 63 and 95 put Higgins 4-2 up and he ended the session by edging a tight eighth frame.
Higgins was 10-4 up at one stage but Selby, belying his previous poor form, hit back with breaks of 81 and 121 before winning Sundays final frame for good measure.
Prior to the final, Higgins suggested Selby could top Stephen Hendrys modern-day record of seven world titles, with time on the 33-year-old Englishmans side.
He could be the one right now who could challenge Hendrys seven titles, Higgins said.
If he goes ahead and beats me, itd be his third and hes still a young man.
Higgins was, however, quietly confident of his own chances, saying: Im very proud to be in my sixth world final, and its a great feeling to be going for my fifth world title.
The pair met in the 2007 world final, with Higgins winning 18-13 against a 23-year-old Selby who unexpectedly came all the way through from the qualifying event.
After that tournament I told him, I know youre disappointed but dont be because youre definitely going to come back and win this thing, Higgins said.
Hes proven that, and now hes going for his third one and hes going to maybe be emulating Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry by retaining it. Hes a special player.  AFP

Identifying the living trends of the Millennials
The millennial generation, or Gen Y, is considered to be anyone born between 1980 and the late 90s. The bulk of this generation has graduated college or university.
They have jobs, and are looking to live independently. Looking at household living patterns across the globe it is evident that Millennials prefer vertical living options for a number of reasons.
Each generation is different than the preceding one, often in surprising ways. Unlike their parents and grandparents, millennials are more comfortable living in an apartment rather than maintaining a conventional house.
Paramount Realty, a real estate company in Sri Lanka through its extensive research has identified that the demand for vertical living is gathering significant momentum among millennials and is expected to grow in the next few years. Some of the key reasons identified by Paramount Realty are as follows.
Reasons Millennials Prefer Apartments (Vertical Living)
Functionally focused layouts
Millennials have somewhat different values and preferences compared to the previous generation. They are looking for affordable apartments with functional layouts. While the previous generations typically look for larger apartments, millennials seek greater functionality and convenience when opting for apartments. Hence, the decision making is usually not based on size or location but rather on convenience and functionality.
More priority on certain amenities
When it comes to building apartment complexes for millennials, it is important to add certain amenities into the floor plans and the layout of the entire complex. Authentic public spaces, pet-friendly options, and inviting tech-focused lobbies are among the key aspects values by millennials when selecting an apartment. Interestingly enough, one of the main reasons that drive millennials to living in an apartment is the compatibility with their lifestyle.
They require access to a fitness center and a pool; spaces where health and sociability is combined. Millennials also truly value community based attributes such as access to coffee shops, food courts and recreational areas. If these facilities are not included in the complex layout, they would at least want it to be available in close proximity.
High emphasis on digital lifestyle
Apartment complexes that cater to millennials should be cable, internet and technology ready.
This generation is connected to the internet 24-hours a day through their cell phones and other mobile devices and hence, technology plays an important part of their daily lives.
Interestingly, around 40-50% of their decisions are influenced by social media and community platforms. Therefore, complex-wide Wi-Fi is also a plus as are lots of indoor and outdoor electrical outlets for charging mobile devices.
The ability to monitor their living spaces and control various devices via mobile applications is also increasingly becoming important to millennials.
Less is more mindset
Millennials are increasingly moving towards minimalism. The decision-making patterns, lifestyle, usage of money and experiences they expect from life is rather different to the previous generation. The minimalistic lifestyle trends of millennials have made entrepreneurs and real estate developers to rethink their strategy when designing living options to cater to this segment of the market.
Typically, the spending power of the millennials is less compared to the previous generation and hence, they prefer to spend on the style of life as opposed to the possessions in life. This will create a unique set of challenges and opportunities for real estate developers.
Preference to Live in Suburbs
There is an increasing trend for millennials to prefer living in suburban locations. The significant appreciation of real estate prices, increase in interest rates (cost of borrowing) and the rapid infrastructure development in the suburban areas and tier II cities are all contributing towards millennial preference to live outside larger cities.
The trend towards placing value on homeownership as opposed to renting has resulted in the increase of demand for real estate in affordable cities.

Inauspicious controversy over auspicious time
It was difficult for Anura Priyantha to choose between the two warring camps of astrologers this year. They had given two different auspicious timings to be followed for the New Year rites this year. One was the officially accepted government time and the other was a time declared by an astrologer who had fallen out with the State Astrologers Committee.
At 2.04 am on April 14, the New Year officially dawned in Sri Lanka. At 7.05am, it was officially accepted as the best time to commence work. By evening of the same day, the controversial garbage dump at Meethotamulla collapsed, eventually killing over 30 people. The collapse which occurred on New Year, perhaps merely coincidental, gave way to the rebel astrologers declaring that the official auspicious time had spelled doom and gloom to the country and resulted in the Meethotamulla tragedy.
As various astrologers contested the authenticity of the New Year auspicious times this year, Anura Priyantha, an office assistance at a government institution said he did not want to offend either party and chose a time in-between the two different predictions to mark Avurudu rites this year,
We looked at our own Litha (Summer Solstice) reading and followed that, we even let a minute pass by, just to make sure, he said.
Priyantha, who wanted to follow the middle path in these affairs, observed that the problem even with the auspicious times was that they too were politicized. If one astrologer closer to the government says one time, the other opposes, to curry favour from the opposition camp. I dont think an auspicious time has anything to do with Meethotamulla. If that was true, what about the other natural disasters he questioned.
Bad timing
Controversy regarding auspicious times for New Year this year, erupted very publicly as members of the State Astrologers Committee who convened to discuss the times with Cultural Affairs Minister S.B. Navinna earlier this year had an open disagreement over the auspicious times.
Auspicious times for New Year play an important role in New Year rites and according to Ananda Senevirathna, a member of the State Astrologers Committee, it was only three years ago that serious disputes over times began to crop up.
The State Astrologers Committee was established in 1983 by former Minister V. J. M. Loku Bandara, on President J.R. Jayawardenas instructions, to have uniformity in the auspicious times announced and followed by the people. Every year, 31 prominent senior astrologers and almanac compilers collectively decide on the auspicious times which need to be followed.
The Committee was set up because people were giving various auspicious times and many started their Avurudu rites at different times. Thus to protect our culture, it was decided that all will follow standard auspicious times, said Senevirathna.
The Committee, according to Senevirathna, has functioned without any major disputes until three years ago. Last year especially, there was strong criticism over the time we gave and we responded to the criticism and the issue was resolved, he said.
It was astrologer Piyasena Rathuwithana who disputed the times last year as well as this year. This was sprinkled with a strong political flavour as none other than former President Mahinda Rajapaksa chose to follow Rathuwithanas times. Rajapaksa had even stated that the official times were actually not auspicious at all.
This year, one person in the Committee, brought in suggestions that the auspicious times need to be changed but the majority rejected his suggestion. His argument was that, the Moon was deposited in the 8th House and according to our time, this was bad. The counter suggestion we brought was that though the Moon was in the 8th house, it was debilitated, so it was not bad and in the Navamsa chart the Moon was in her own House, so that too was not bad, explained Senevirathna.
Then he said this auspicious times should be taken from the Pisces sign. But the best counter argument to that among many is that if we were to do that, in keeping with the time Sri Lanka became a Republic, this would make the auspicious time to be in the 8th House - this is the death position. The country became a Republic on May 22, 1972 at 12.43pm and the ascendancy was in Leo then. This would be the 8th House in Leo and that is bad. In addition, the present leader of country was born under the Libra sign and if we are to go with Pisces, this when counted from Libra, comes to the 6th house - this is that of disease and enemies. So we cannot take that.Either way, his arguments are neither good for the country nor the leader. So we rejected his proposition for the auspicious time, he further explained.
Despite these arguments however, Rathuwithana and another astrologer G.M. Gunapala have given interviews and printed leaflets stating that it was due to the wrong auspicious time that Meethotamulla collapsed. In addition, they also say that the next eight months would be a testing time for the country.
The people in the area say that 12 hours prior to the collapse, glass on their cabinets cracked, pipes burst and animals ran away like in the Tsunami. That is 12 hours before our time to commence work. The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Commissioner had also said that he warned the people several months back about this and asked them to move. This was marked as a high risk zone. The geologists in the meantime, say that the mountain sunk due to the heavy rains. This was not ad-hoc, said Seneviratne as he combined science with the reading of his astrology to point out the logic in the allegations.
This person though an astrologer is not a gentleman, he said.
Astrology in State Affairs
In the highly superstitious island nation, astrology has always been used as a political and cultural tool to shape the destinies of our leaders. During the rule of former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike astrology dominated state affairs. She decreed that Ceylon would become the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, precisely at the astrologically prescribed time of 12.43 p.m. on May 22, 1972, thus setting the time upon which Sri Lankas stars would be read thereafter. She also changed the lyrics of the national anthem from "Namo Namo Matha to Sri Lanka Matha as she blamed the misfortunes of the country at the time on the unlucky lyrics rather than poor political decisions. Bandaranaike, however, was not alone in choosing the astrologically mandated path in politics, every Head of State since then have followed suit.
Astrologers in the meantime, have both raked in profits as well as doom depending on which way they chose to play their luck. The infamous astrologer Sumanadasa Abeygunawardena did extremely well over the 10 years in which the former Rajapaksa regime reigned. His counsel was not only sought at every important government decision but he also held sway over the former Presidents personal decisions. It was over Abeygunawardenas advice that Rajapaksa called for elections two years early, resulting in his eventual defeat.
In 2009, astrologer Chandrasiri Bandara was arrested for predicting that Mahinda Rajapaksa would be soon unseated and that Ratnasiri Wickremenayake would be President with then Opposition Leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe being made Prime Minister.
In January of this year, Astrologer Vijitha Herath was arrested for predicting that President Maithripala Sirisena would soon be dead.
Attack on culture
To Asha Perera, an administrative assistant, who followed the official auspicious time, to get the timings right meant that all her affairs throughout the year would take place without any hindrance. She said that the more controversy surrounding it, the less people were going to believe in it.
Jayasiri Jayakody who has been following auspicious times since he was five years old, said it has been a strongly emphasized family tradition,
I am 57 years old now, nothing spectacular happened as a result of these times but neither has anything bad happened as a result of it. I follow it as a Sinhalese but as a Buddhist I can only say, What can the stars do he said.
Whether he believes in astrology or not, for Jayakody it is tradition and he said that it was important to him that his children too followed these age old traditions and uphold the culture he grew up on.
Senevirathna too echoes similar sentiments. Though the latter has made it his profession to read the stars, he said the art itself was important for the continuity of the Sinhalese culture.
In 1959, when SWRD Bandaranaike was killed, why did they choose a priest Why Somarama That bullet not only killed Bandaranaike but it also damaged generations of the Sangha, said Senevirathna and added,
It was an attack on our culture and beliefs. By doing this to our auspicious times, they are trying to destroy our traditional beliefs. It is certainly a conspiracy.
Rathuwithana however said he would stand by his own prediction and stressed that the auspicious times released by the State Astrologers Committee would spell doom for the country for the next eight months.
This is not about whether the majority agrees on a time or not. You have to be able to read the correct time. It is about having that knowledge, said Rathuwithana.
Rathuwithana who has been having a continuous feud with the rest of the members insisted that the Committee needed to be dissolved and new members appointed. I do not survive on this committee, I will no longer be attending sessions if they continue with the current committee, he said.
Senevirathna who hit out strongly against Rathuwithana for choosing to publicly condemn the Committees rulings said disciplinary action needed to be taken against Rathuwithana.
There were always criticism over the times, but they were well tolerated, these things must happen but no one has ever given alternative times. It is given that if a majority agree on a time, the rest should follow suit and not criticise it is public and throw disrepute on the whole committee, he said.
This is the furnishing of weapons for those who want to attack astrologers, added Senevirathna.
Politics in Astrology
Minister of Cultural Affairs, S.B. Navinna however was nonchalant about the feud and to him the whole affair was about following due procedure.
These auspicious times were decided on last July and by December everything was printed and published. In April, we simply hand over the times to the President as part of the ceremony, there was nothing new to contest. The times were already signed off by all 31 astrologers in the Committee, it was not clear why this one person contested the time after having signed off on it earlier, said Minister Navinna.
This Committee was not appointed by me and neither did we remove or add people. They have been there for years. After the one person protested, I convened the whole committee and invited the media for the discussion to sort things out. When they were arguing it out, the one who opposed could not support his arguments and he left. One person can say anything, he can make an auspicious time bad or good, he said
The Minister further explained that earlier the times were sent by the former President Rajapaksa to Abeygunawardena to approve of but now the government simply went ahead with the Committees majority ruling.
There is no politics for me here. What we give is an overall time, it might be good for some and bad for others. When the Meethotamulla dump collapsed, they may say it is due to the auspicious time, but that collapse only affected those who lived in its vicinity. That same auspicious time did not affect others who did not live there. So you cannot blame the time, said the minister.
Following the New Year, President Sirisena made a political decision to remove key SLFP organizers from their posts, changing their immediate futures.
Can you blame our auspicious time on the fate of those organizers We did not ask anyone to be changed. The government gives people an overall time, it is up to them to make good with that, said the minister setting the record straight.

## Title: Liberalism Vs Neo-Liberalism

Liberalism Vs Neo-Liberalism
The term neo-liberalism is widely used in Sri Lanka by left politicians and left intellectuals mainly, Dr Wickramabahu Karunarathne, Dr Dayan Jayathilake, Dr Kumudu Kusum Kumara, Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Pubudu Jagoda to describe the economic pattern and policies followed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinges administration.
With the widespread coining of the word neo-liberalism in economics circles, many enthusiasts pose a question in order to find an answer for the difference between liberalism and neo-liberalism. This article attempts to distinguish the difference between two concepts.
First World War
Early stages liberalism was classical and early liberals emphasized mainly on laissez faire (free trade) and limited government. Thus from early stages liberalism never lost its correct meaning in most of the time in its history. In Spanish-speaking countries, the word liberalismo denotes, an ideology of free trade and free markets rather than a limited government. However thinkers in the calibre of T.H. Green and L.T. Hobhouse (reformist liberals) reformed the classical liberal ideology specially in sphere of concept of limited government and professed that there was a role for the government to enhance activity and authority to promote ideals of distributive justice and social harmony in socio-economic activities which was later regarded as a progressive opinion by the liberals though it was not essentially a socialist or social democratic outlook.
The catastrophe of the First World War shattered the liberal world that had existed from 1815 to 1914. In England the Liberal Party governments under Prime Ministers H.H. Asquith and Lloyd George largely abandoned the classical liberal positions and successive governments applied views of reformist liberals to control excesses of free market. The Second World War changed the cause of the history with one party dominant system in Germany and Soviet Russia killed the aspirations of a liberal world order.
John Maynard Keynes who was instrumental for the Keynesian school of economics, also differed from classical liberalism, developed a modern liberal view in the aftermath of the 1930s with failure of the free-market system known as the Great Depression. His views are described and known as Modern Liberalism.
Keynesian theory
Keynesian paradigm disintegrated in late 1970s and new thinkers emerged to settle theoretical issues in economics. Two such schools of thought were Chicago School and Austrian school. Milton Friedman of the Chicago school advocated monetary control as the means for stable growth. Austrians maintained the principal cause of economic stagnation was the non-coordination of relative prices induced by government intervention.
Milton Friedman became the main advocate opposing Keynesian theory and said that there existed a natural rate of unemployment and argued that employment above this rate would cause acceleration of inflation. Friedman promoted an alternative macro-economic policy known as monetarism and argued that small expansion of money supply was the preferred policy. His ideas concerning monetary policy, taxation, privatization and deregulation influenced government policies in both USA and UK from early 1980s.
Friedrich Von Hayek of the Austrian School was a true liberal and he advocated implementing classical liberal economic views with high level of democracy, rule of law, representative and constitutional government with a party system. He predicted socialism would definitely fall. He emphasized those dictatorships whether they are right or left would not enhance freedom of people and that will have a direct bearing on economic growth. For him competition between producers and also between and among consumers is another essential part of the market process. He was also a promoter of micro-economic policies and predicted that the socialist economic system soon or later would definitely be collapsed. He promoted the idea of individual liberty, and advocated against central planning.
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank had borrowed the ideas of Friedman and Hayek especially in late 1970s and influenced sectors of respective governments to implement what they thought would be beneficial for economic growth.
Conservative political parties
Understanding, that the IMF and World Bank were professing old classical liberal views for economic development in a new form and character, leftists and left academics criticized that IMF, World Bank and respective rulers and bureaucrats as introducing old policies of classical liberalism in a new form and branded them as neo liberals.
However so called neo-liberals or politicians mainly from conservative political parties only borrowed the ideas of economic development professed by Freidman and Hayek but not their democratic views. Therefore liberals are also criticizing the workings of so called neo-liberals as they are essentially conservative elements and represent conservative political parties.
Ronald Reagan and Margret Thatcher were the best examples in this regard. They followed the economic theories of Friedman and Hayek but not their democratic views and ideals. United National Party (UNP) government under J.R. Jayewardene was first to introduce open economy in the South Asian region yet UNP is not a liberal party but a conservative party. When a conservative party attempting to introduce economic policies of Friedman and Hayek, the left, left academics brand those conservatives as neo-liberals. So, from the liberal point of view Ranil Wickremesinghe could not be considered a liberal in ideological sense, could be branded as a neo-liberal by the left politicians and academics.

Merkel to meet Putin to discuss crises in Syria and Ukraine

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to meet Vladimir Putin in Russia for the first time since 2015.
The meeting, at Putin's summer residence in Sochi, comes at a low point in bilateral relations over the war in Syria and Russia's annexation of Crimea.
They are expected to discuss both issues during their meeting - but no breakthroughs are expected.
Putin will then meet Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday.
Ties between Russia and Germany have worsened since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea in Ukraine, with Germany being a driving force behind the EU sanctions imposed in response.
The pair, who are among the most powerful world leaders, have crossed paths at international summits recently.
But this meeting - with the official purpose of discussing the G20 summit of world leaders to be held in Hamburg in July - is the first trip Merkel has made to Russia in two years.
Merkel wants Russia to seek an end to the conflict in Ukraine by using its influence on pro-Russian separatists, and also needs Moscow's cooperation to bring peace to Syria, the BBC correspondent in Berlin, Damien McGuiness, says.
But President Putin equally needs Merkel's support in to lift the EU's sanctions, our correspondent adds. Putin is also keen to hear her opinion of US President Donald Trump, whom she recently met.
The pair spoke frequently before the breakdown in communications since 2014, and were said tohave a grudging respect for one another.
She speaks Russian, having grown up in communist East Germany, and he speaks German, from his years working for the KGB in Dresden in the 1980s.
Russian news outlet Tasssaid the pair would discuss terrorism, the Middle East, and the Minsk agreements on the Ukraine crisis, quoting a Kremlin press source.
But both sides have downplayed the prospect of major breakthroughs during their meeting in Sochi.
Germany remains critical of Russia's actions in Crimea in 2014, and the two leaders stand opposed on the war in Syria.
The German domestic intelligence agency hasalso accused Russia of being behind a series of cyber attacks on state computer systems.
In contrast, Putin's scheduled meeting with the Turkish president the following day comes at a time of increased cooperation between the two nations.
While they back opposing sides in Syria's civil war - with Moscow supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Ankara his opponents - the two countries begancarrying out joint air strikes against the so-called Islamic Statein January.
The joint operation came a little over a year after Turkey shot down a Russian military jet, resulting in a crisis in bilateral relations.
US President Donald Trump is also scheduled to speak to President Putin by phone on Tuesday, the White House announced Monday night. They are expected to discuss the war in Syria.

Met Gala: Katy Perry attracts criticism for John Galliano dress

Katy Perry has attracted criticismfor wearing a Maison Margiela dress by John Gallianoto the Artisanal Met Gala.
As co-chair of the event it was expected that Perry would wear a striking design, but some fans have taken issue with the man behind it.
Galliano was sacked by Christian Diorin 2011 for "odious behaviour", after being arrested over a video which showed him making racist and anti-Semitic insults at a bar in Paris.
In September 2011 he was sentenced to pay a fine after being found guilty of making anti-Semitic remarks. He attributed his behaviour to alcohol addiction and sought rehab treatment.
In 2013, for the first interview given since the incident, Galliano said: "I am able to create. I am ready to create... [and] I hope through my atonement I'll be given a second chance."
While he has been welcomed back to the industry by several insiders, his role in such a high profile event has caused controversy.

NCE commends government on GSP+ regain
The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) has commended the Government on its success in regaining the GSP+ facility to boost exports from Sri Lanka.
The NCE Commends the Unity Government on its success in regaining the GSP+ facility after overcoming the final hurdle in the EU Parliament. This will provide the much needed impetus to Sri Lankan exports to facilitate accelerated economic development.
The GSP+ Preference would entail the full removal of duties on 66% of tariff lines, covering a wide range of products including Textiles and Garments, Fisheries Products, Rubber Products, and Machinery.
Since the EU consisting of 27 countries is the biggest export market for Sri Lanka accounting for 1/3 of total global exports of the country, the concessions can make a significant contribution to Sri Lankas economic development by increasing exports to the EU market especially by the apparel sector which accounts for 46% of Sri Lankas Exports. In 2015 EU imports from Sri Lanka amounted to 2.6 Billion Euros which highlights the significance of the concessions that will be available.
There are Eight GSP+ beneficiaries among developing countries. In this context the Chamber notes that Sri Lanka will have a particular advantage over competitor countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the Philippines for exports especially in the Textiles and Garments Sector.
GSP Plus currently covers 13 beneficiaries: Armenia, Bolivia, Cape Verde, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Georgia, Guatemala, Mongolia, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and the Philippines. Sri Lanka was a beneficiary country since 2005 to 2010.
The Chamber notes with satisfaction the focus of the Government and its efforts since assuming office in January 2015 to regain the facility, which has now borne fruit, after its initial success in lifting the ban on fisheries exports to the EU market.
The Chamber is conscious of the fact that Sri Lankan Exporters will undoubtedly face certain challenges, in regaining the hitherto lost markets related to the EU. Additionally another challenge will be the withdrawal of the UK from the EU or Brexit, since the UK is the main EU country for Sri Lankan Exporters.
With a view to educate exporters on the benefits related to the GSP+ facility, the rules and regulations pertaining to exports to the EU, quality requirements of the Products and Services, and measures to overcome the challenges when exporting to the EU to derive maximum benefit, the Chamber will conduct a Forum during the last week of May 2017.

Nearly 83,000 kgs of paddy to be sold at a loss
The Agriculture Department has decided to sell traditional paddy stocks stored at Anuradhapura Senanayake stores to the private sector at a loss. Nearly 83,000 kilograms of traditional paddy is reportedly being sold at Rs. 56 per kilo.
The decision is because the plan to cultivate traditional paddy in the Anuradhapura district on a large sale was unsuccessful.
The Farmers Trust Fund in collaboration with the Agriculture Department had bought the paddy two years ago at Rs. 70 to 80 per kilo from the Padaviya zone where the cultivation of traditional native paddy on a large scale was initiated.
The target was to cultivate 50,000 acres with traditional native paddy varieties such as Suwadel, Pachchaperumal Kuruluthuda, Heenati, Madathawalu, etc without using any agro chemical or artificial fertilizer except carbonic fertilizer by 2017. However, at present, the cultivation is limited to just around 7,000 acres.
According to farmers organizations in Padaviya, Siripura and Parakramapura, the farmers have given up the cultivation of traditional native paddy as a result of lethargy on the part of the Agriculture Department. The farmers complain that they were encouraged to grow traditional native paddy on the promise of adequate marketing facilities being provided to them with a higher price for the paddy. However, such promises were not fulfilled and the farmers were put into great inconvenience. The government boosted the traditional native paddy cultivation in the Anuradhapura district some years ago in view of the increasing kidney diseases in the district as traditional native rice possessed medicinal qualities to heal and prevent kidney ailments.

Next generation anti-ransomware Crypto Guard Technology comes to Sri Lanka
The next-generation anti-ransom ware Crypto Guard technology is now available with its Sophos Server Protection products in Sri Lanka.
With this optimization, Sophos Server Protection now has signature-less detection capabilities to combat ransomware - similar to Sophos Intercept X for endpoints. In September 2016, Sophos launched Sophos Intercept X with Crypto Guard, which stops the spontaneous encryption of data by ransomware within seconds of detection.
By adding Crypto Guard to server security, Sophos is closing a critical gap by preventing ransom ware attacks that could come in through rogue, guest or remote access users or other weaknesses in a companys network.
For example, if a company allows bring-your-own-laptopson the network, remote access for employees or is victimized by an insider cyber threat, servers become highly susceptible to ransomware. Additionally, network shares on servers are high-value targetsas they contain proprietary financials, personally identifiable information and other key data, and should be protected as such.
Servers are the lifeblood of any organization as theycontain majority of business-critical data and intellectual property, and run business critical applications whichmakes them so appealing for attackers with financial or disruption driven goals.It is therefore, very important for any business to keep their servers secure, available, and performing at optimum levels,said Sunil sharma, vice president  sales, India & SAARC at sophos.
Sophos has also expanded Synchronized Security by adding Sophos Security Heartbeat capabilities to Sophos Central Server Protection Advanced. By adding Security Heartbeat to servers,an IT administratorcan nowleverage Sophos XG Firewall to automatically isolate infected servers and endpoints to identify and respond to the source of compromises faster.
Sophos Server Protection products with CryptoGuard capabilities now includes Central Server Protection Advanced on the cloud-based Sophos Central platform and Sophos Server Protection Enterprise, which is managed with a traditional on-premise console.
Protection for servers is especially critical for our customers who allow remote desktop connections or have weak desktop credentials, which is a known vulnerability for ransomware attacks.
Even our customers who have put every safeguard in placecould still havean exposed server,due to that one rogue laptop someoneconnects into the network. Just one click on a tainted email could encrypt every file with ransomware.
At Lifeways, our userslog into servers to accesstheir email and websites, so we definitely need a solution that prevents ransomware. Already, we use Sophos Central Server Protection Advanced for approximately 100 servers, said Andy Pitcher, group infrastructure manager at Lifeways, a Sophos customer in London, England.  Lifeways has been hit by ransomware in the pastand it was not fun. The attack came in through an end point and hit the serveras well. We were able to restore quickly, but our business did come to a halt for a while.
Sophos Server Protection and Sophos Intercept X are critical defenses for us, and we plan to use them throughout our entire estate.

He also said that in 2020 the UNP would set up a government of its own. No body can prevent it, Minister Hashim said. He was speaking at the UNPs May Day Rally at Campbell Park in Borella yesterday.
Minister Hashim also said that those who were in power are attempting to topple the government, which is impossible. The UNP as a political party is geared for elections at any moment, Minister Hashim said.
Speaking at the rally Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said Mahinda Rajapaksa when he was the President thought that the ships passing the sea off Hambantota would come to the Hambantota port when he waved a flag. He added that the project was a white elephant. He also said that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was not in Sri Lanka when his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa contested for the Presidential Election.
When Mahinda Rajapaksa won the election he came to the country with only USD 10,000, Minister Fonseka said.
But, later he is alleged to have amassed wealth and property with a massive fish tank with sharks in it. He had to spend Rs.10,000 to feed the fish aloneo, Field Marshal Fonseka said.

Nobody can reverse countrys development programme: PM
The United National Party would not allow anybody to reverse the development that has commenced under the good governance government for the people, UNP Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the UNP May Day rally at Campbell Park, Borella yesterday.
The PM also said that the Rajapaksas of the previous government who are very well aware of their losses at future elections because of the governments development projects, are attempting to disrupt the these programmes.
Premier Wickremesinghe further said that the UNP is becoming more popular and is confident of winning future elections.
We accept that the UNP has not been able to solve the issues of the party supporters who were subjected to political vengeance, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
But, we request you to support development programmes initiated by the government.The previous Rajapaksa regime handed over us a bankrupt economy with a heavy burden of foreign loans. We had to make the economy stable and then initiate the development projects,the Prime Minister said.

The Premier further said that the Rajapaksa regime put the country in a labyrinth of debt and burdened with loans to the tune of Rs.960 billion.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added that by 2020, the country is bound to settle USD 15,000 million in loans.
The previous government had no plans to settle the loans. They had lost the GSP Plus facility that the UNP government had obtained to export goods to Europe, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
As we promised during the election campaign, we obtained the GSP Plus facility again two weeks ago..
The Premier added that when exports are increased with the support of the GSP Plus facility, the countrys economy would be strengthened and problems of all would be solved. Within this short period of time, we have been able to commence the development programme with work on the Volkswagen factory at Panala, Kalutara Tyre Factory,the Koggala garment factory and the construction of a number of tourist hotels, the Premier said. This year Japan has agreed to help develop Colombo, the Colombo Port, to construct another port north of the Colombo Port, development projects in Kandy,the agriculture and economic sectors etc.
The Premier also said that Japan has also promised to grant equipment for the Trincomalee Port, to develop the same port, Digitalise the Rupavahini and set up an LMP plant in Kerawalapitiya. He added that even the Indian government has promised to develop another LMG plant in Kerawalapitiya, develop the Trincomalee oil tanks in a joint venture. With this move the CPC also get an opportunity to access the Indian market. He also added that investors from India, Japan, Korea, China and many other countries are coming to Sri Lanka. When the economy is developped, we would settle the loans with the profits, Premier Wickremesinghe said. The Rajapaksas though that we would not be able to develop the economy. Now they are afraid as they know they would not be able to win an election. Their dreams of two Poyas to set up a government. But, I assure them that they would not be able to set up a government even after poyas of two centuries,the PM said.
The Prime Minister also said that the previous regime that shot Roshen Chanaka dead and people at Weliweriya has no moral right to talk of workers rights and peoples rights. The Premier also said that those of the previous regime attempt to disrupt the governments development programmes and we assure that this government would not allow them to do so in anyway. The Premier added that the UNP would continue its struggle until 2020 and take the country foward.

Palette of  Expressions
He walked with ladies in the fields, the wind rustling the grass and the sky was dark. He looked into the eyes of a beautiful African maiden and watched her smile, the scarf framing her face. He stood awestruck before the compassionate and majestic Bodhisattva. The gypsy with a thoughtful look on her face puzzled him. The woman seemed to be in pain, she seemed to him, distraught, hiding her face. The mother carrying a child seemed to be troubled as if the horizon was full of darkness. The beautiful smiling sweet girl perhaps reminded him of his own daughter. Jayantha Silvas mind travels through alternate realities. He is an artist.
Jayantha Silva
Im like a fine wine. I get better with age. The themes in my art are often messages about life, society or human nature. Thats why I have called all my Exhibitions Expressions. This is my 14th Annual Solo Exhibition, said Jayantha.
Jayantha has gone from strength to strength. His first exhibition was Expressions 1 which was held 13 years ago at the same venue, Lionel Wendt.
The inspiration comes from moving with my friends and relations. Their ways and expressions have inspired me very much. Also being observant about situations I see while traveling in my day to day life contribute. This is thanks to my photographic memory, pointed out Jayantha.
Jayantha says that 90 percent of his paintings are images from his mind. I see them, I store them and I paint them. Let it be consciously or unconsciously, stated Jayantha.
The great Leonardo Da Vinci is his inspiration, but this Jayantha is also a connoisseur of art. I am married. Marriage has not affected me but inspired me to greater heights. I have one sweet Daughter. She does not paint but admires my work, he says
I use several mediums. Acrylic, Soft Pastel, Color Pencil and Charcoal are the main mediums. I have done a few water color artworks. Unfortunately I have still not gone into Oil, he added.
Jayanthas 14th Annual Solo Exhibition Expressions 14 will be held at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery starting with a preview at 6.30pm on May 5. Expressions 14 will be open from 10 am on May 6 and 7.

President Premadasa born and died  among people: Prime Minister
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said President Premadasa born and died among the people. He dedicated himself for the people and he demised among people. His death is marked by the May Day which represents people.
Prime Minister Wikeremesinghe was speaking at the 24th commemoration of the former President, R. Premadasa held before the R.Premadasa statue in Hultsdorf, Colombo.
The international community has given Sri Lanka two years to deliver a national solution to the ethnic issue and boost national reconciliation process in the country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Wickremesinghe said the Yahapalana government will be able to realise national reconciliation and Sri Lankan identity - the former President R. Premadasas hope for Sri Lanka.
The Premier pointed out President Premadasa upheld a vision for one Sri Lankan nation. Wickremesinghe was referring to a speech made by President Premadasa where he said If I was able to become the President of Sri Lanka, anybody can. PM Wickremesinghe pointed out that former President meant no Sri Lankan should be discriminated due to their ethnicity or other differences.
Premier Wickremesinghe said an interim report by the Constitutional Council is in the making regarding a national solution and extensive discussions are being held regarding the matter with all religious leaders and the civil society.
The Prime Minister said the international community had Sri Lanka marginalised due to the spread of racism, religious conflicts and political hatred within the country in few years after the end of war. He pointed out the previous regime developed an antagonistic stance against the international arena instead of working with them. It was in a backdrop as such, the joint government headed by President Maithripala Sirisena came into being, the Premier pointed out.
The Prime Minister said rounds of discussions are held regarding devolution of power while ensuring the integrity and the sovereignty of Sri Lanka. He said human rights, election system and freedom of religious practices are topics that have been discussed in length as well.

President promises  to lead SLFP through clean politics
President Maithripala Sirisena promised yesterday to lead the SLFP into victory through a campaign of clean politics. No matter the conspiracies that were weaved to break this party apart or to stop it in its tracks, I have in the last two years turned a defeated party into one that is growing from strength to strength in the last two years, said the President addressing the May Day rally in Getambe grounds in Kandy yesterday.
As the crowds trickled in, hampered by rain, the President was the last to address the gathering organized under the theme As one fist in the right direction.
The march which started at 1pm from Girls High School, took two roads, over 6km and 6 hours to reach this ground.
This is the political might of the SLFP and UPFA, he said, stressing on the turnout.
We no longer have workers. People are now skilled professionals and political parties need to listen to these voices, said the President.

As President Sirisena celebrated his 50th year in politics with the SLFP, he referred to the various challenges the party had gone through over the years and he reassured his supporters and members that he would use his vast experience to rebuild the party based on clean politics.
The SLFP May Day rally this year was plagued with the concerns of a split and SLFP members who addressed the gathering prior to the President, appealed to him to reunite the party and to have a single May Day rally next year.
The message this May Day should be is that we all get together to further strengthen the party and not split it or form a new party, said SLFP Vice President, Nimal Siripala de Silva as he stressed that a 2020 government would be SLFP-led.
Those here are the true SLFPers. It is you who protect the SLFP, said UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera, while leader of the National Congress A.L.M. Athaullah; a constituent party of the UPFA said today we have two SLFP rallies; one in Kandy and the other in Colombo. If we can bring these two together, we can send a signal to the UNP and make the SLFP stronger again. I trust that the President will not let the SLFP split.
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. John Seneviratne meanwhile appealed to the President to stop the occurrence of two May Day rallies and asked that the party be united next year.
The President in his speech, however, remarked that he had not asked anyone to either leave or not join the party.
There is certain criticism over the changing of party organizers and they say this has led to a split. Such criticism comes from those who want to start a new political party, from those who are having a separate May Day rally and who do not support any party activity. I would like to state clearly here that I will use my experience to take the party forward no matter the challenge, he said.
The President stressed that he did not take over the Chairmanship of the party by force, rather he was invited to take it on by the former President and the Central Committee.
He also explained that it was due to the current political journey as a unity government with the UNP that Sri Lanka was able to win over the international community and overcome its pariah status.
Today, no country interferes with our internal affairs. And this could not have happened if the government had not changed in 2015. We no longer stand accused by the international community, said the President.
The President who addressed concerns of natural resources and land being sold to foreign powers, assured the masses that he would not allow Sri Lankan assets to be foreign owned.
We have sold no land to foreigners. The biggest treachery was the Port City. We renegotiated with the Chinese and turned free holding land to lease and changed clauses which did not suit us, he said.
Those who live in glass house cannot throw stones at us, added the President.
Indigenous thinking, reconciliation and a Sri Lankan identity, said the President were ingredients needed to develop the country.
In the last two years, we have done more for the workers movement than any other government. We have also now decided to solve the discrepancies in maternity leave and make it mandatory for all female workers. Earlier, it was only women in office work who enjoyed all 84 days but now it will be ensured that all female workers, in factories and shops also get the maternity leave that is mandated, said the President.
The SLFP also read out proposals to undertake Constitutional reform with Buddhism given due prominence and all other religions are ensured equality, to introduce a new mixed electoral system and ensure the unitary state of the country while allowing the devolution of power to the periphery.

## Title: A princess with  finesse no less!

A princess with  finesse no less!
My wife and the immediate family had been trying without an iota of success to influence our grand-daughter, Moya Lihini since she was three or thereabouts that she has absolutely no links or any clanship to royalty.
Her aunts and the family matriarchs feared that the problem with princess stories would reinforce her obsession with crowned heads and celebrity culture. As in the case of most little girls any story involving a fairy tale princess grabs her attention as nothing else would.
So naturally our Moya lives life as a fairy tale, focusing only on the pretty princessy things. She is well aware that we have put her at the centre of our family universe. But ever since we have been reading to her and from the time she learnt to read by herself she has put herself at the centre of the entire universe.
The family contends that when a girl is a toddler this can all be a heck of a lot of whimsical fun. But further down the line they worry that the fanciful fixation can set the tone for all kinds of psychological problems. The fear that she might not be able to cope with the cruel realities of the real world has troubled them no end.
Even the most logically convincing reasoning has in no way been able to dissuade the little fury that the appellation Princess has been thrust on her only as an endearing designation. But she remains unmoved.
That is because spoilt little girls with minds of their own are stubbornly set in their ways. In similarity to most children of her age she has been influenced to a great degree by her first storybooks. You know the type, the ones that feature archetypal fairy-tale princesses, gallant princes, extravagant castles, talking animals, giants, trolls and wicked stepmothers. And not forgetting the joyful endings where they all lived happily ever after.
The last example of wicked stepmothers is perhaps why divorcees and widower fathers of young progeny never get the approval of their little ones to take another shot at marital bliss or rather marital blitz. A successful business divorcee once mischievously quipped to a buxom woman he fancied that the secret of a successful marriage was incom-patability, not to be mistaken with incompatibility.
He decoded his coined word with the explanation: I have the income, you have the patability. He managed to escape unscathed only because he beat a hasty retreat seconds before his wisecrack sank in to the head of the voluptuous lady.
I must actually concede that my name has become a household word because I have become a sort of literary celebrity only among my immediate and extended family. My grandchildren in particular have acted as though my book launches were really more exciting than they really were. They are also actually the only ones who are all ears when I feel the need to talk too much.
That is why I suspect, as a last resort I was dragooned into the family conspiracy to wean our lovely Moya off the princess disorder. This was with the hope that my influential wisdom would persuade our little girl to relegate her imperial mindset to that of a more modest station. Honestly, I must say I gave it my best shot conjuring up all my persuasive powers in the process.
But then again I gave the whole procedure some serious thought. It struck me with clarity that our fascination with monarchy has been inherited from the time we were British subjects. I also surmised that women of all ages from the time they were little girls have loved to portray an image of regal class and sophistication.
I relished the reality that women of all ages are little girls at heart and pine for that halcyon phase of life. Yes the older they grow, the once little girls still want to be little girls. But then again all you mothers, grandmothers and great grandmothers out there who have reservations about the Princess Syndrome would probably have gone through the same flights of imagination while being empowered to create your own mythical kingdoms and castles in the air.
Yes every girl creates her own fairy tale and pretends she is a princess at one point, no matter how little her life is like that. But as they say, if you dream a thing more than once, it's sure to come true. I analysed the situation and asked myself the question whether this was necessarily a bad thing, though
After all, princesses have been fairytale protagonists for hundreds of years. The characters of Cinderella and Snow White long predate their modern day incarnations. Set your mind into the thinking of a little girl and you will soon realise that the appeal of princesses is not hard to understand.
So I felt there was nothing strange about Moyas enthrallment with the princess phase. It is a perfectly natural phenomenon where all young girls resist any criticism or alteration of their majestic mindset. The wealth and privilege factors of being a princess make it a close parallel to classic boys fantasies of being superheroes.
Take my own case for example. In the mid to late 50s, I was in love with the Wild and Woolly West. My dream of being a cowboy included a deep desire to have a full cowboy outfit that included the stetson, shirt, jeans, boots, and a pair of revolvers in leather holsters hanging from a wide, hand-tooled gun belt with a shiny, silver buckle. Dreams have no limitations.
As it happens a part of my home boasts a section which soars more than 40 feet skywards and is embellished with several windows that give it a castle-like appearance. That has been another factor which has bolstered little Moya Lihinis assurance about her regal bloodlines.
Clearly aggravated by the line of reasoning adopted by the family disbelievers she was constrained recently to make a powerfully rational rebuttal. How come you all say we are not royalty when we live in a castle Besides, my Dada (thats yours truly) is the King of Writers. I blushed uncontrollably at the crowning accolade although I must admit that I rather enjoyed the wildly extravagant honorific. A family wag uncharitably countered her rave review with: She must have mistaken a Joker for a King.
Bitchiness and rude remarks apart there is no disputing her logic that a mans home is his castle. So I for one will never again question either her assumed grandiose lineage or her delightful flights of the imagination.
The others may content themselves with wallowing in the realities of life. But there are two of us now who revel in living out our fantasy while belting out the lyrics of the old nursery rhyme: Now Im the king of the castle, get down you dirty rascal!

Recycling plastic waste the BPPL way
While the garbage issue is being debated, BPPL Holdings, one of the largest backwardly integrated brushware manufacturing facilities in South-East Asia, has been recycling plastic waste profitably setting benchmarks.
Sri Lanka annually imports 9,600 tonnes of raw plastic virgin (PET) to manufacture bottles, packaging and for other requirements. Out of this, around 30% (2,880 Tonnes) is re-exported by way of food covers, fluid containers for beverages and packaging.
The balance 70% is being used in Sri Lanka and the used plastic waste remains in dump yards creating huge environmental issues. Today out of this waste, 40% are is once again recycled.
The BPPL group identified this danger and got about finding a solution for it. Its Chief Executive Officer BPPL Holdings Limited (BPPL) Dr. Anush Amarasinghe said that they started collecting the plastic waste and then started recycling it.
Taking another step forward they started manufacturing brushes with them and exporting it globally bringing in valuable foreign exchange to the country.
Today, out of the 40% plastic waste thats recycled, one third is being purchased by BPPL. For the first time in Sri Lanka BPPL has alo created history by building a facility coming up to manufacturing recycled synthetic yarn in Horana for the fabric manufacturing industry using plastic waste. BPPL will invest Rs. 675 million on this facility which is set to open early 2018.
The company is also building its own solar and bio mass plants which are helping them to lower electricity costs.The company has invested Rs.110 million on these two plants.
BPPL factory manager Prasantha Malimage told Daily News Business that plastic waste is a major environmental issue that needs to be addressed very soon. Plastic does not absorb to the soil unlike other forms of garbage.
Today, plastic waste contains contamination items like condoms and used sanitary items in hotel garbage loads, urine test bottles, saline needles and injections in hospital garbage loads and even venomous snakes, rats, scorpions in bottles that are thrown away.
However, unlike other garbage, with proper guidance and education it can be solved and this is exactly what BPPL is doing.
We have collection centers in many parts of the country from where we buy plastic waste and then wash them within hot water, scientifically treat them and then systematically crush them to take to our factories to make recycled export items.
He said that in most of the other countries, especially in developed countries, citizens are very responsible and bring back used plastic bottles and used plastic items, packaging back to super markets when they come to shop.
These are then put back into special plastic collecting bins which are then collected by recycling companies. Under proposals being the business law formulated by the Central Environment Authority, Sri Lankan companies and especially supermarket chains too should follow this. We are ready to take a step forward and pay cash to super markets and buy plastic waste from them.
They only have to allocate space to dump the plastic waste and this, as one of their priority CSR initiatives,which will also bring in some extra cash for them from companies like us.
BPPL Holdings Limited (BPPL) Chief Executive Officer Dr. Anush Amarasinghe said they did speak to some supermarkets who have responded positively.
He said the government too should take an initiative and tell the supermarkets to follow this and have a series of educational programs in this area. When this program is fully operational and up and running,the plastic waste in Sri Lanka will be no longer an issue.
Founded in 1984, BPPL Holdings manufactures a range of high quality, durable cleaning products for both professional and household applications.
Leveraging on its sustainable manufacturing and vertically integrated processes, coupled with commitment to consistent quality, on-time delivery, reasonable pricing and flexibility allows it to supply to major distributors and retailers of cleaning tools worldwide.
BPPL Holdings was established as a limited liability company in 1991 following the transfer of activities from Interbrush Lanka Ltd., which was founded in 1984. The company manufactures a range of high quality, durable cleaning products for both professional and household applications.
Dr. Amarasinghe received his Bachelor of Science and Ph.D. degrees in Electronics Engineering. After graduation, he joined Thorn EMI Central Research Laboratories, UK as a Research Engineer until 1992 during which time he patented two inventions relating to low cost, low energy consuming electronic ballasts for lighting equipment.

Red-hot Nadal wins dream 10th Barcelona Open
BARCELONA, Monday - Rafael Nadal hailed a dream start to his clay court season after romping to his 10th Barcelona Open on Sunday with a 6-4, 6-1 win over Austria's Dominic Thiem.
The Spaniard also claimed his 10th title at the Monte Carlo Masters last week as he gears up for to go for his 10th French Open next month.
It is two consecutive weeks winning, in Monte Carlo and here, two special tournaments for me, it is a dream start on clay, said Nadal.
It means a lot for me to reach number 10 here in Barcelona, in front of the people of my club, I am very happy and emotional.
Nadal won in Barcelona between 2005-2009, 2011-13 and now in the last two years.
The 14-time Grand Slam champion also looks like the man to beat at Roland Garros after winning on a Barcelona court named after him and where he didn't drop a set all week.
I thank the club and its members for putting my name on this court. It means a lot to me, added Nadal.
Nadal has now won 19 straight sets, but Thiem was the toughest opponent he has faced on clay so far this year.
Thiem had shocked world number one Andy Murray in Saturday's semi-finals and showed some early resistance.
The world number nine even had his only break point of the match in the first game.
But Nadal, returning to top form at age 30, upped his intensity at the crucial moment and Thiem crumbled with three errors in the 10th game to give away the only break of the set.
The first set was vitally important, added Nadal.
It was hard. I was having a few more chances than him but it was very even and that is why I celebrated with so much energy at the end.
The second set was a procession as Thiem's frustration at his inability to break through Nadal's defences saw him consistently fire long.
Thiem held off three break points in his opening service game, but was powerless to stop Nadal thereafter as he won the last five games to seal victory in just over 90 minutes on court.
However, Thiem wasn't too disheartened after losing out to the king of clay after what had been a productive week.
I really enjoyed the week in Barcelona, he said.
There are worse things than to lose against the greatest player on clay ever.

A Sri Lankan woman touring the Chennai city was killed when the cab she was travelling in with her family plunged nearly 20 feet into the RBI subway at Parrys on Sunday. The police said being a Sunday, there was relatively less traffic in the subway, or else there would have been more casualties.

Smurfs: The Lost Village: Simple story,  slapstick  humour
After two previous movies which tried to woo the audience into becoming Smurf fans and failing in their efforts, one wonders why the makers havent put their efforts to rest and sued their time and efforts to explore new territories. However 2017 brings the third Smurf movie to the screen in the form of 'Smurfs: The Lost Village'.
The reboot tries to salvage the dismal run of its predecessors. This time they filmmakers try to kindle some interest by introducing a new Smurf tribe. However, yet again the story fails them. The sworn enemy of the Smurfs, Gargamel, is up to his evil deeds again. He recaptures his invention, the first female Smurf named Smurfette and gets information about a secret Smurf village out of her. After breaking out of his prison Smurfette is guilt struck and together with Clumsy Smurf, Brainy Smurf and Hefty Smurf, she embarks on a journey to worn the inhabitants of the other village.
More for the kids
Based on Belgian artist, Peyos, 1958 creation Smurfs: The Lost Village is directed by Raja Gosnell. The film opens with introductions to the Smurfs as they go about their business in their pretty village. There is Vanity, Jokey, Farmer, Nosey, Brainy, Clumsy, and Hefty Smurf. The wise Papa Smurf looks protectively over them. Smurfette is the exception - the only girl Smurf in the village.
As in the previous Smurf movies, 'Smurfs: The Lost Village' too is more for the kids. There is nothing unique about the Smurfs who lead the show because they and their traits have already familiarized to the audience via the previous films. The villain remains a weakling and generates no fear. He and his cat are too caricatured to make is seem realistic.
The only plus point is that the filmmakers have decided to stick with computer animation this time round. The previous movies were a mixture of live action as well as animation, making a total mess of the visuals in the projects.
Demi Lovato who voices for Smurfette stands out but the rest of the voice cast including Julia Roberts are insignificant. Ellie Kemper is an exception. She as Smurf Blossom manages well as the excitable and energetic girl Smurf who welcomes the new comers to their world.
Riotously funny moments
The film does contain some riotously funny moments, but these are sadly few and far between. A sequel, as it seems, is already underway. This is not enticing news for animation movie buffs who would like to feast their eyes on something new.
Some movies are much looked to franchises but filmmakers should know when to call it quits when productions keep on generating dismal audience reaction.
The previous Smurf movies have tanked at the box office and this one seems to be following their route. Maybe it is time that The Smurfs calls it a day.

US: Deadly weekend storms have left at least 14 dead in the midwestern and southern United States, according to officials, as eastern regions faced potential damaging winds and isolated tornadoes into Monday. 
Severe weather devastated homes, overturned cars and felled trees, with the National Weather Service confirming at least four tornadoes in Texas. 
The mayor of Canton, Texas -- a city some 60 miles (95 kilometers) east of Dallas -- said the death toll there stood at four. 
It is heartbreaking and upsetting to say the least, Mayor Lou Ann Everett told journalists Sunday. 
A spokeswoman for the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management told AFP severe weather had caused at least five fatalities in that state. 
The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency had confirmed two deaths, one of them a child who was killed by electric shock in floodwater. 
Heavy rains also lashed the midwestern state of Missouri, with at least two reported casualties. According to CNN one of those killed was a 72-year-old woman who was stranded in her car as it was swept away by floodwaters. 
In Tennessee, a two-year-old girl was pronounced dead at a hospital in Nashville after she was struck by a heavy metal soccer goal blown over by heavy winds, according to the citys police department. 
As of late Sunday the NWS was projecting major flooding to continue in parts of eastern Oklahoma, northern Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana. 
Authorities warned that severe storms potentially packing heavy winds, large hail and tornadoes could hit parts of the mid-Atlantic and northeastern US by Monday afternoon.

Tales of an accidental cricketer
My good friend Ravi Jayasuriya from Melbourne had this interesting article which the readers might find amusing.
His most memorable cricketing experience was playing against one of Sri Lankas greatest cricketers, the late C.I. Gunasekera, on the SSC turf. He only faced two overs from him; well actually about 10 balls since he bowled him or had him stumped before the end of the second over, he further adds. He believed C.I. was well past his prime at that time but being able to counter his high class leg spin gave him enormous self-confidence.
So how did this unforgettable experience come about Well quite by accident he states.
One fine day way back in 1966 as a 17 year old, he made his first visit to the SSC grounds to watch a cricket match. Ravi, not being of an academic bent, had lots of time to spare those days. He was not sure who was playing whom but probably he wanted to get away from parental scrutiny for a while. As it happened SSC was playing Negombo SC (with apologies to the denizens of Negombo, it was not an outfit you heard much those days) and he had got there in the lunch break. Negombo SC was to bat after the break and their top order was outside having a hit to get their eyes in. One of their batters didnt have anyone to bowl to him and noticing Ravi gaping, threw the ball at him. Well obviously he impressed the batter, because he asked Ravi if he would not mind making up the numbers for the day, as they were short of a player.
No prizes for guessing, what his answer was! Before long he found himself walking out to the turf, in his best test batsman manner, to face a legend. The late great C.I., tall, fair and handsome, looking down the wicket and no doubt licking his lips at the prospect of adding another scalp to his already formidable tally. Memorable though it was, he could not remember each and every delivery. Suffice to say he managed to fight back negative thoughts and reminded himself what a batsman is supposed to do in those situations. Dont look at the bowlers face; look at the wrist at the moment of delivery. Keep your eyes on the ball and follow it all the way to the bat etc. His old school coach, during his under 16 school cricket (he didnt make it to the first 1st Eleven) would have been proud of him!
There he was, playing at one of Colombos premier venues, putting bat to ball and smothering the wily spin of one of Sri Lankas greats. Many an international player, he states, for sure would have struggled to come to grips with C.I., when they tried to read C.I... Well as he said earlier, the magic did not last long and soon he was back in the pavilion, comforted by his new found team mates. Tea was taken on the top floor of the pavilion and he thoroughly enjoyed the Lingus sausages and sandwiches which was laid out for them in style. It was not his daily team time snack those days. However the real treat was sitting at the same table with C.I who he was told, had in his day, played with as well as against the legendary Keith Miller, one of his idols.
However he was happy to say that his new team liked what they saw in his efforts and invited him to join them at their next game the following week end at the Moors ground in Colpetty. This was sheer magic but not for long. I was soon brought crashing down to earth!
The Moors game ended his promising career as a serious club cricketer in Sri Lanka. He was promoted to open batting, which was flattering but although he scored a few runs, he did not last long enough to see the shine off the new ball.
A well-built pacey scattered his stumps all over the place and with them, his dreams of making of an innings to remember. It was a serious dereliction of duty!
To make matters worse, he dropped a catch, which was unforgivable. No matter it was high and he had to cover lots of ground from deep square leg. Catches win matches and you are not supposed to drop them. His one consolation was to see his name in print the following day and being able to show off to his buddies.
In 1969 he went to England and had the good fortune to play the great game to his hearts content, practically every summer for 20 years. But when he looked back, he felt his time would have been better spent living and playing in Colombo, the city of his birth.

Tasteful  tunes
Tamara is a Sri Lankan singer/songwriter who currently resides in Melbourne with her family: husband Jacob and son Christopher. Tamara's parents also live in Australia having migrated in the mid 1960s to Melbourne. From then, their courtship began and later marriage followed.
Tamara's mother Indra St John, is of Malaysian Indian decent and father Leo St John was born in Galle and raised in Panadura.
Tamara was born in Melbourne, Australia, and grew up in a suburb called Strathmore where she attended St Vincents Primary School and St Columbas Catholic College. Tamara began to further her studies at Victoria University to gain a Bachelor of Business Management Degree, majoring in Human Resources.
Tamara's connection with Sri Lanka is quite deep. She frequently travelled to Sri Lanka to visit her family and friends who reside in different parts of the island. Tamara is extremely fond of her roots and always loves to go back to embrace the local population, food and culture.
She had been writing songs since the age of 15. Her style of singing belongs to the ballad genre. Her lyrics come straight from her heart and with her own life experience. She says that she composes her music first and then pens her lyrics. Recently she did a music video called Rain with another co musician named Gershom Moses.
It is about a troubled relationship between two people who are madly in love with each other. Up to now this music video had more than one million views all over the globe on you tube. With her hard work and dedication Tamara had the opportunity to collaborate with many artistes in Australia.
She has successfully done three music videos so far and all three songs had been played on the former Malaysian Austrohitz TV, Hitz FM and Lite FM. She won the best dance Category in the VIMA in 2016 for her single called  When you turn on me.
How did you get into the field of music
My passion, commitment and love for my music developed from the early age of four years. Equipped with a keyboard, I would play and sing and entertain the children in the street. I would sing everywhere I went. Every function and every event would pretty much be my platform to showcase my talent. I would make up songs and sing at the top of my lungs. The more I sang, the more I knew I wanted to become an entertainer.
My talent stems from my father, who is an exceptional singer. He encouraged me at a young age to listen to music, play an instrument and sing. I would sing songs that were playing on the radio with him.
They were such beautiful moments to share with someone who enjoyed music and who was as passionate about music as I am. In between writing songs from the age of 15 and over the years, I continued with school and university and worked tirelessly to perfect my craft while working full time in the capacity of a HR Consultant.
This day time job allowed me to fund my ambitions and to date I still work hard to attain my goals.
Your father used to be the lead singer of a local Sri Lankan band in 1960.
My father was 14 years old then and decided to enter a local talent quest sponsored by the Colombo Rotary Club. It was one of the most popular talent quests in those days and was hosted and judged by the famous band the Jet Liners.
My father was selected by the Jet Liners to perform in the preliminaries and was given an opportunity to start a band with other local talent. They named themselves Adventurous.
They went on to playing at local festivals and events in Panadura. My father was often invited to sing Bailas at Sri Lankan dinner dances and functions on many occasions.
Four years later, my father decided to migrate to Australia to further his studies and in between his studies he continued to sing at dinner dances in Australia and Malaysia.
2013 was a tragic year for you. You have experienced traumatic and tragic incident related to your life and your perspective on life changed in a moment of seconds.
2013 was a year that I do not want to reflect on as it has taken me countless of years to move forward in my life.
I will say however, that my entire mindset on life changed. I changed the way I lived my life, the way I treated people, and by that I mean exude even more love and care for family, friends and people in general.
I decided to do more charity work and help people with their problems and daily issues.
I changed the way I made decisions and the way I viewed life in general. Suddenly what I would have thought were big matters in my life weren't so big any more. I changed for the better.
Who is your favorite Sri Lankan vocalist
Personally I do not like to say who is my favorite singer whether it be a Sri Lankan artiste or another artiste of a different nationality, genre and style because I believe each artiste is unique and talented in their own way. I would have to say that I like a few Sri Lankan artistes whether they reside or not in Sri Lanka and they are Iraj, Infaas, Bathiya and Santhush, Natasha Rathayake, Kamal, Derrick Junkeer, Andrew De Silva and Shean Dharmaratna.
I have a large amount of respect for all of these artistes. Their lyrics, compositions and style of singing speak volumes as they put in a lot of emotion to tell a story. I find that their artistry resonates with me and it would be my greatest honour to be able to some day work with them on a song.
What would be your reaction if you get a chance to act in a Classic Sri Lankan movie
I would be so honored to work with such fine talented, creative and crafted local artistes and actors. It would be a very special and memorable achievement.
What are your future plans
I wish to continue working my way up in the music industry and to give back to my fans wholeheartedly for their belief in me.
Their constant encouragement inspires me and allows me to continue to do what I do best and that is making music and writing songs.
What is your perspective of Sri Lanka
I always love going back home to Sri Lanka, because no matter what state or situation the country is in, people still manage to have the biggest heart, so warm, loving and welcoming.
I cherish how humble and down to earth the locals really are.
Their smile seems always constant and I love to see that smile. It touches my heart tremendously.

Tea tax, SVAT issue addressed by govt speedily - Minister
The Plantation Industries Ministry says tax issues concerning the tea industry is currently being addressed at top government level along with several other issues.
Minister Navin Dissanayake and Tea Board Chairman Rohan Pethiyagoda have met Tea Exporters Association (TEA) representatives on numerous occasions to sort out their issues.
The Ministry was responding to a series of news items initiated by the TEA published last week.
The Ministry is of the view that certain aspects and facts have been left out so that a more complete and holistic view of the industry was not given and the TEA media release gives a totally negative view of the TEA industry which is incorrect.
The Ministry says that the Minister submitted a cabinet paper on the SVAT issue and it was decided by the Economic Subcommittee chaired by the Prime Minister to suspend the proposed new structure.
Under the current administration, a large amount of funds and development work are envisaged to the tea sector.
These include, the Development of the smallholder sector under funding from FAO, a US$ 65 million project already underway. These funds will be the largest amount of funds received by the tea industry at particular moment of time.
With regard to TEAs concerns on the falling tea production, the Ministry says that it has been a case of concern for everybody.
In 2014 the highest tea production was reached at 340 m MT and since then 320 m MT and 292 m MT was recorded in 2015 and 2016. The Ministry says that while TEA gives the low figures for January and February this year it conveniently omits the fact that in March tea production came to normalcy as 26 million Mt was produced as the drought conditions were reversed.
To state that tea production has drastically come down is not correct as tea production is continuing in a stable manner.
When the current Minister took office tea prices were at an absolute rock bottom with a price range of Rs 400 to 450 and there was much protest, agitations and threat of social unrest if subsidies were not increased.
However today the prices have increased between Rs. 550 to 600 and a large sector of the tea industry is satisfied with the current situation. The government has despite financial problems maintained the fertilizer subsidy allocating Rs 1500 million for years 2016 and 2017 separately giving weight and importance to the small tea producer.
TEA has also raised the issue of the global tea campaign to be launched by the export levy on tea exports that is in place. The Minister and the Tea Board Chairman went out of their way to ensure these funds remain in the Tea Board as they realize the value and the need of a well targeted global campaign for Ceylon Tea. Unfortunately government regulations and procedures have meant some unwanted delays have arisen.
It will be a pity if US$ 50 million is just spent for the sake of spending it. Therefore the ministry is confident that this campaign will begin in the next 3 to 4 months.
It will be more helpful to the industry than individual stakeholder organizations issuing media releases that portray a negative image about the Sri Lankan Tea Industry, the Plantation Ministry release said.

Ton-up Chase and Holder give West Indies edge
BRIDGETOWN, Barbados: Roston Chases second Test hundred and fine support from captain Jason Holder in a record unbroken partnership lifted the West Indies to 286 for six at stumps on the opening day of the second Test against Pakistan at Kensington Oval in on Sunday.
Called upon to repair yet another debacle at the top of the order after Holder chose to bat first, Chases unbeaten 131 was characterised by calm assurance and elegant strokeplay after he came to the crease at 37 for three.
Even if he lived a bit dangerously, the skipper also played positively and will resume on the second day alongside Chase on 58, their partnership so far worth 132 runs and establishing a new record for the seventh wicket in Tests for the West Indies against Pakistan.
Chase has so far faced 207 deliveries in five hours at the crease, stroking 17 fours while Holders innings has occupied 125 deliveries over three-and-a-half hours with eight fours decorating his knock.
On a surface offering very little assistance to the faster bowlers, the Caribbean team still managed to slip to 154 for six in mid-afternoon and at that stage it looked as if the tourists would have been well into their reply by the end of the day.
Opening bowlers Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Abbas claimed a wicket apiece in each of the first two sessions while Shadab Khan, selected for a Test debut in support of senior leg-spinner Yasir Shah, earned his first success in the shape of Shane Dowrich after Shah had accounted for Shai Hope.
There was very little assistance from this pitch and we will have to come back even harder on the second morning to break this partnership, said Abbas, who had figures of two for 47 off 18 overs, at the end of the day.
My experience of playing a lot of first-class cricket back in Pakistan would have prepared me for days like this.
Amir was the first to strike for Pakistan at the start of the day against a batting line-up surprisingly unchanged from the seven-wicket defeat in Jamaica.
Kraigg Brathwaite enjoyed a moment of good fortune when he was dropped at short extra-cover off Amir.
However the lapse did not prove costly for the visitors as Amir took the outside edge of the openers bat in the same over to give a straightforward catch to wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed.
Shimron Hetmyer, one of two batting debutants from a week earlier, faced just three deliveries before driving loosely at Abbas for Azhar Ali to take a sharp catch head-high at third slip.
Hopes struggle for runs continued when he was caught at the wicket off Shah, the leg-spinner extracting sharp turn off the first-day pitch and appearing to justify Pakistans decision to give a debut to Shadab at the expense of their fastest bowler, Wahab Riaz Kieran Powell, who batted through the morning session, departed on the resumption after lunch.
An lbw appeal off Amir with the batsman on 38 was ruled not out by on-field official Richard Kettleborough only to be overturned on review of the television replays.
Vishaul Singhs miserable start to his Test career continued with a low catch to Younis Khan at second slip off Abbas and Younis secure pair of hands were again in evidence when Dowrich, on 29, pushed at a full length delivery from Shadab and the veteran made no mistake.

True story  inspires: Dawn to Dusk
Kanchana Thuraisingham is a Government Scholar who went to University of Pune from Sri Lanka and completed her Bachelor of Commerce Hons Degree in 90's.Then she migrated to Canada working in the Finance field for few years. This was the time where many Sri Lankans migrated to Canada.
In 1993 Kanchana was certified by the Ministry of Citizenship Canada as a Cultural Interpreter. This was the stepping stone to meet many community people from Grass root level to every other level in different situations. Coming from a War zone, it was shocking to meet many devastating stories and the Trauma came along with their baggage.
Dawn to Dusk producer Kanchana Thuraisingam
Going to a Womens Shelter changed my mind to switch my career from Finance to Social Work. My own people were struggling in a new country where they came for refuge. Even though Canada was a great country,
It was hard for the community to adjust with the new culture, weather, language, legal system etc.This caused many family disputes, Depression, Addiction, Financial struggles and many other. These factors made me change my career as A Social Worker. I volunteered and gained experience in many non profit organizations and went to School to study in the field. Also certified my self as a Crisis Counselor, Kanchana says.
She has worked as a Front line Counselor for Victim Services with the Region of Peel Police. They mainly worked on Domestic Violence. Later she became the first Sri Lankan to establish a non-profit organization called "Sri Lankan-Canadian Community Services in 2006.This agency is a platform for all Social needs.
During my career I had seen many stories of individuals but this particular incident was something which cannot be accepted and imagined. This led me to write the story and bring it to visual as a community outreach.
Initially it was planned as a short film which now transformed into a future film. There has been other situations merged and completely privacy has been maintained, she added on the movie she has penned the script for and produced.
Dawn to Dusk has been filmed in Canada and Cuba. The team wanted scenes showing the nature of Sri Lanka and Cuba was the best location to create such atmosphere. All the artistes involved in the project are Tamil Canadians.

Twain fears Lyme disease  may have been behind  voice collapse
The country star developed dysphonia, a vocal cord disorder often caused by stress, but she recently discovered a bacterial infection may have been behind the drama.
As she warms up for a performance at this weekend's (29-30Apr17) Stagecoach festival in California, Shania tells the Los Angeles Times that she wasn't able to fix her vocal issues with an operation and months of silence, like Adele, Sam Smith, Meghan Trainor, and Steven Tyler.
"A singers typical problem is nodules on the vocal cords from overuse or poor technique," she tells the newspaper. "That was not my problem. My problem isnt unique, or rare, but the exercises are very different than for nodules, and I cant get an operation for mine."
Twain reveals she'll always have to take care of her voice before shows for fear it will give up on her again.
Many people believed the stress surrounding the breakdown of her marriage to songwriter/producer Mutt Lange prompted her voice issues, which kept her out of the recording studio and off the stage for six years.

Voice of the people ON MAY DAY
May Day rallies clearly illustrate the stark political, economic, and social cleavages in Sri Lankan society. Three major demonstrations that took place in Colombo, those of the UNP, JVP, and Joint Opposition (JO), drew crowds in the tens to hundreds of thousands that hailed from all corners of the island.
While the constituents of the JVP and JO were quick to condemn the coalition governments progress, or lack thereof, those of the UNP pointed to its triumphs.
Period of freedom
JVP supporter Nandasena
The rule of law has been reinstated in the country, and the legal situation is in good condition. Its not like the earlier days where there were white vans. Its a period of freedom in Sri Lanka, said K. Perera, a farmer from Ratnapura.
Corruption free society
U. Gunawardene, like Perera, defined the success of the coalition government in negative terms, in that he pointed to the abuses of the former government that no longer occur explicitly.
The corruption of the last regime is over. I can say that with confidence. No longer do people, especially enemies of the past regime, have to fear for their lives, he said.
Development poised to flourish
M. Rafeek, however, acknowledged that many of the promises that Ranil Wickremesinghe made when he reassumed the role of Prime Minister had not yet come to fruition.
N. Fernando
We have to give the administration more time. Its only been two, two and a half year. They deserve our patience. They have done a lot to improve the rule of law.
They just secured GSP+, which is a good sign. I think increased foreign direct investment and infrastructure development will come in the next two or three years, he said.
JVP can form a society for all to live together and prosper
The JVP supporters, however, were far less forgiving of the coalition government, as many of them noted that there is little difference between it and the Rajapaksa regime.
All these politicians are the same. They say the right things, but then nothing ever comes of those words. We need to form a society for all people to live together and prosper. I think the only party that gives us that hope is the JVP, said T. Banda, a farmer from Kurunegala.
The idea of hope permeated the rhetoric of the JVP supporters who spoke with the Daily News, each of whom pointed out that the UNP and SLFP, as well as the JO, do not properly or effectively fight for the poor and vulnerable.
They might tell you that they will increase subsidies for farmers or provide better education for children, but they really wont do anything about it. The poor in villages are in the same situation as we were three years ago.
The JVP has a plan to make the poor economically empowered. They know about the interest of the poor, and hopefully they will get power in 2020. That way we can make the country work for rich and poor equally, said Renuka, a farmer from Anuradhapura.
Nandasena, another farmer from Anuradhapura said he thinks the JVP will fight for him.
We just need a party that will give us a voice. The corruption and greed that are going on in the country are worse than when I was young. We need a voice, he said.
Unlike UNP supporters, most of whom pointed to their partys achievements in favour of talking about the policies that would lead to greater prosperity, the JVP marchers put forth a coherent set of policies that they believe would improve the quality of life for most Sri Lankans.
Many held signs protesting education privatisation, environmental destruction, inadequate support for farmers and other labourers, and corporate corruption.
These are the policies that will make Sri Lanka a more equal and fair place that allows everyone an opportunity to improve their life, said Renuka.
Govt does not provide sufficient subsidies
The JO supporters, by contrast, seemed to care little for policy. Marching up Galle Road between rows of buses, this mostly male group, many of whom were in an inebriated state, enthusiastically extolled former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Mahinda is an honest man. The government is not providing me sufficient subsidies. I know that Mahinda will give me more, said Sudath, a dairy farmer from Tangalle.
Mahinda is my president. All the corruption accusations against him are baseless. He is the only one capable of fixing the country, said C. Fonseka of Colombo. When pressed on exactly how Rajapaksa would fix Sri Lanka, he replied: I know he would.
UNP supporters carrying an elephant symbol to Campbell Park 
In between complimenting Rajapaksa and various members of his family, the supporters railed against President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe in colourful language.
But N. Fernando, a tour guide from Panadura, gave a more measured endorsement of Rajapaksa.
You have to give him credit for ending the war, building the highways, the Hambantota port, and the Mattala airport. The coalition government has not provided that kind of development at all, he said, while adding that, in his estimation, none of Sirisenas or Wickremesinghes promises have become a reality.
Octopus made by JVP supporters on parade
All these people are saying Rajapaksa is corrupt, but look at the bond scandal. These people are doing the same thing, he said.
Suffice it to say that there was little agreement on the best way forward for Sri Lanka. UNP supporters pointed to past achievements as proof that their party is on the right track, while backers of the JVP and JO lambasted the unity government.
While the JVP backers offered some policy recommendations that they hope would lead to prosperity, the JO patrons celebrated Mahinda as the saviour.
As he walked by, a monk shouted that Mahinda was a God worthy of praise.

Water-proof  Denim Jeans are 'in'
Firebrand jeans retailer Long Island Clothing Company (LiCC) today launched a trail blazing brand of water-proof jeans and thus takes the much favoured denim jeans to yet another level.
The launch of the water-proof jeans titled LiCC Libert invites you to be part of a grander scheme. Wearing wet clothes is always a drag, but wearing wet jeans can be even more so due to the weight. Chances are you might be caught in a sporadic thunderstorm which will eventually soak through your denim jeans. This hampers your journey and your style but with LiCCs new style revolution, rain need not be a damper as your jeans will stay dry as the dessert and fashionably so!
Nature offers a glimpse of this concept through the lotus plant which appears nonchalant about water droplets which roll off its surface. Similar to its rough texture that expels water, is the Libert collection, inspired by the origins of nature itself to present the much-anticipated water-proof jeans. It is the most authentic pair of jeans for those who wish to live without boundaries.
No retailer in the Sri Lankan market has launched a local product as such and we at LiCC wanted to be the first to launch the water proof jeans, targeting all the bikers in Sri Lanka, to make them ride with freedom and confidence. It is not merely the bikers who will benefit from this fabulous brand but each person who has felt the discomfort of being soaked to the bone in a pair of wet jeans, said CEO of LiCC, Yasotharan.
