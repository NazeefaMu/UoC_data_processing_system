Auspicious time for US firms to do business with Lanka
This is the best auspicious time for American firms to do business with Sri Lanka, remarked Robert Hilton, Charg dAffaires at American Chamber of Commerce Annual General Meeting last week.
American firms are eager to do business here and the U.S. Government is engaged in ways to increase bilateral trade between our countries.
He said that there is a renewed commitment from US for the fact that the government is focusing on key areas and other fundamental values.Two weeks ago, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Mark Linscott visited Colombo and encouraged the Government of Sri Lanka to implement policies that will increase trade and improve the business climate.
Mark emphasized that to attract more trade and investment opportunities, Sri Lanka will have to institute predictable, sound, and transparent economic policies, including taking steps to remove corruption and favoritism from government tenders.
He also discussed removing some of Sri Lankas tariffs that overly burden domestic and foreign businesses. He urged the promotion of intellectual property rights and encouraged Sri Lanka to increase its own competitiveness by joining the WTO Information Technology Agreement, or ITA.
At the same time, Mark also addressed micro-level issues.
He brought up the current one-year limit on residence visas as a barrier to foreign investment. We were told the Government of Sri Lanka will be lengthening the duration of residency visas to three years, which I am sure will be welcome news to many of you.
When the Government of Sri Lanka takes such positive steps after joint lobbying from the AmCham and the U.S. Government  U.S. firms will naturally migrate to Sri Lanka. As they do, Sri Lanka will be able to import more high quality U.S. goods, he added. Currently, Sri Lanka exports $2.8 billion of goods to the United States annually while Sri Lanka only imports $269 million from the United States.
For the benefit of both our countries, this enormous deficit needs to be closed. The Embassy will continue our engagement with the Government of Sri Lanka and the business community to address this issue.
Our work, our shared work, is challenging, but we are all contributing toward a Sri Lanka that is more inclusive, more just, more peaceful, and more prosperous. And, through our hard work, the United States and Sri Lanka will become closer friends and allies and will do much more business together where all parties will all benefit.
He also said that the he and Ambassador are both heartened by the increased number of American companies represented on the AmCham board.
I believe that American companies are more engaged because the AmCham is becoming more effective, and that increased engagement in turn only improves and increases what the AmCham can achieve. (SS)

Sri Lanka extends support to Bosnia Herzegovina
Sri Lanka has offered its support to Bosnia Herzegovina in its quest for European integration, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said.
Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana paid an official visit to the Republic of Bosnia Herzegovina from September 28 to 30 on an invitation extended by its Government.
Foreign Minister Marapana had a meeting with the Deputy Foreign Minister of Bosnia Herzegovina Josip Brkic in the latter's constituency at Medjugorje on September 29. At the meeting, Deputy Minister Brkic gave an account of the history of Medjugorje and explained how it became a center of religious significance for the Roman Catholics.
Deputy Minister Brkic explained to the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister the constitutional background of the Government of Bosnia & Herzegovina, particularly their system of elections, the rotating Presidency and their application for European integration. The Deputy Foreign Minister briefed Minister Marapana on the Human Rights problems faced by Bosnia & Herzegovina during the Yugoslavian war and the difficulties of post-war reconciliation.
Foreign Minister Marapana had briefed the Bosnia Herzegovina Deputy Foreign Minister on the current constitutional reform process in Sri Lanka and offered Sri Lanka's support to Bosnia and Herzegovina in its quest for European integration, a Foreign Affairs Ministry statement said. Minister Marapana had met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bosnia Herzegovina Igor Crnadak on September 24. The one to one meeting between the two Foreign Ministers was followed by formal discussions between the delegations of Sri Lanka and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Welcoming Minister Marapana and the Sri Lanka delegation, the Foreign Minister of Bosnia Herzegovina highlighted the importance of the meeting and saw it as a springboard for opening diplomatic relations and bilateral cooperation between the two countries, both of which are in the process of post-conflict reconciliation and reconstruction.
Foreign Minister Marapana, thanking his counterpart for the invitation, made a brief reference to the Non-Aligned Movement, of which former leaders of the two countries, Sirimavo Bandaranaike and President Tito were pioneers. He assured Minister Crnadak that a BosniaSri Lanka parliamentary friendship group would shortly be formed in the Sri Lanka Parliament.
Foreign Minister Crnadak stated that though the main focus of Bosnia Herzegovina at present is on integration with the European Union and regional cooperation with Balkan states, they are also very keen to open a new chapter in foreign affairs by establishing trade and investment promotion between Bosnia and Asian countries like Sri Lanka. He said that to that end the opening of an Honorary Consulate in Colombo is a welcoming step.
Minister Marapana invited Minister Igor Crnadak to visit Sri Lanka to promote bilateral relations. At a press conference, which followed the meeting, the two Ministers outlined the importance of the present visit in promoting mutual cooperation and goodwill between the two countries, the Foreign Affairs ministry said.
The Foreign Minister was accompanied by the Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to Austria Priyanee Wijesekera and Namal Zoysa, Second Secretary of the Sri Lanka Embassy in Vienna.

Youngsters of today did not have proper childhood due to war
Children of this country did not have a childhood for the past 30 years. They spent their childhood in a country that was on fire because of racial tensions and they did not have a tomorrow to look forward to. The youngsters today are the children of those days. They must have memories of their childhood. Our country did not have the bonds that we have today. We are really split along boundaries, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
He was addressing a gathering at the Manchester International Football Institute, Kollonawa, to commemorate the world Childrens Day where the biggest training session in Sri Lanka held in this regard.
The Minister said Children have followed the example of their elders and were divided along narrow racial lines.
"Children have the freedom to learn and play. It is the responsibility of the elders to train youngsters to maximise use of this freedom. I request all citizens of this country not to corrupt the young and impressionable minds of our children. It is everyones duty to develop a strong generation who will take charge of the countrys tomorrow," he said.
He said there was a drop in the percentage of children taking up to sports. "The main reason is that children give priority to studying. Another reason is that parents do not have the financial ability to spend on extra activities for children. A strong future generation can be built up if children are encouraged to take up a sport that is in keeping with their financial abilities," the minister said.
He said it was common in our country to see people cheering different countries when international matches were played forgetting that they were Sri Lankans.
"In this world there is only one country that a person can call his motherland. We are all Sri Lankans no matter what religion or ethnic group we belong to. If more and more children are encouraged to take up sports I believe that we will be able to develop a strong nation tomorrow," the minister said.
Manchester Football Institute Kollonawa had organised the event to commemorate their first year anniversary and representatives from all over the island participated.

Audit report on Central Expressway, SriLankan Airlines to Parliament this month

The special audit reports on the Central Expressway and SriLankan Airlines will be presented to Parliament this month, Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe said.
Speaking to the Daily News, the AG said today that his Department is currently working on these audit reports as per the instructions of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE).
The two reports will be handed over to the Speaker and the COPE Secretariat.
The report on the Central Expressway deals with the procurement procedure followed with regard to the construction of section three of the Central Expressway and the report on the SriwLankan Airlines deals with the order made to purchase 8 long distance airbuses and its cancellation.
Both these are serious and complicated issues. Our teams are now collecting the necessary documents pertaining to the audit, he said.
Commenting on the order of eight A350 airbuses to the SriLankan Airlines, the AG termed it as an insane decision that resulted in heavy financial burden to the country.
The SriLankan Airlines ordered those eight aircrafts at once despite the fact that it was already incurring massive loss. It was done without knowing any means to repay and without knowing any route to operate them. Certainly it was not done thinking of the future market, he said.
The AG pointed out that he would not term the additional cost the Government had to bear in cancelling the aircraft deal as a loss.
Had the Government proceeded on the deal the total cost the Government has to bear would have been enormous. We will indicate that figure in the report. The compensation payment was to avoid that plight. Already Rs 16 billion has been paid as compensation to cancel four airbuses and the last payment in that regard is still to be made. The amount of compensation for the rest of aircrafts is yet to be negotiated, he explained.
The AG, further observing that the SriLankan Airlines came under the scrutiny of the AGs Department very recently, said the Department audited it for the first time last year. The AG also said a performance audit on the SriLankan Airlines is being conducted now, adding that the payments made to its management would come under scrutiny during the audit. We understand that there are certain issues over the payments made to its top management. The details of them will come out when we present our 2016 audit report with regard to the SriLankan Airlines, he stated.

Australians deny demanding money for return of Tamil refugees body
Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry vows to cover cost
The Australian High Commission in Colombo is denying that they, or the Australian government, ever demanded money from the family of a deceased Tamil refugee in exchange for sending his body back to Sri Lanka.
The 32-year old Rajeev Rajendran was found dead at the Australian detention facility on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, on Monday. Officials there say he committed suicide.
Aran Mylvaganam, a spokesperson for the Australia-based Tamil Refugee Council, said that Rajendrans family had visited the Australia High Commission in Sri Lanka on Monday.
There, the family was told that they would have to pay 900,000 Sri Lankan rupees to have (his) body transported home, he said in a statement. But the High Commission is denying Mylvaganams account.
The Australian Government  including the High Commission has not been approached by Mr. Rajendrans family and has not requested funds to repatriate his body, they said in a written statement Wednesday evening.
They added that because the man died in Papua New Guinea, repatriation arrangements are a matter for the Papua New Guinea Government.
This is an appalling abrogation of responsibility, Mylvaganam responded in an interview Thursday.
The Australian government transported Rajeev to Papua New Guinea and the camp on Manus Island  no amount of legal manipulations can erase these facts, he said. He accused the Australian government of trying to pass the buck.
He also said that the request for money may have come from the Consular Office of the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry, with whom the family has also been communicating about Rajendrans body.
Reached by phone Thursday evening, Senior Director General of the Consular Affairs Commission GanegamaArachchi said his office is looking for funds to cover the repatriation cost for the family.
This is a unique case, and we are not ruling out the possibility of finding funds at any time, he said.
Rajendran had been seeking asylum since 2013, according to the Tamil Refugee Council. He was being held at Manus Island, a former Australian military base, which the Australian government uses to house refugees and asylum seekers.The Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea ruled that such a practice was illegal last year, and the centre is scheduled to close at the end of October.
Multiple human rights groups, including Amnesty International, claim that refugees are systematically deprived of mental health care at Manus Island.
Mylvaganam, of the Tamil Refugee Council, said that Rajendran was suffering from depression for over a year, and had tried to cut his own throat just three days before his death.
He said the situation was further evidence the detention center should be closed, and all refugees and asylum seekers there granted protection.

CONSUMER WINS FR PETITION AGAINST CEB, POLICE
For arrest made on false information | CEB ordered to pay Rs.1 million and former Piliyandala OIC to pay Rs. 100,000
The Supreme Court ruled that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Piliyandala Police have violated the Fundamental Rights of an electricity consumer by arresting him on false information that he tampered with an electricity meter in 2005.
A Three-Judge-Bench comprising Justice Anil Goonaratne, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Vijith K. Malalgoda ordered the CEB to pay one million rupees as compensation to the petitioner, a resident of Katubedda, for violating his Fundamental Rights.
Nishan de Silva, a former OIC of Piliyandala Police was also directed to pay Rs. 100,000 as compensation to the petitioner.
This is a Fundamental Rights Application pertaining to an electricity meter which had been tampered (alleged to be tampered by the Petitioner). The Petitioners main complaint is that he was arrested by the Police on false information.
He also states that the Electricity Board officials (Respondents) falsely implicated and made very incorrect observations to merely put him in trouble. The petitioner also pleaded that the eighth Respondent Nalaka Udayanga closely associates the officers of the Piliyandala Police. The petitioner pleaded that the ninth Respondent, a CEB Manager Investigations had instigated the impugned arrest of the Petitioner, by making false complaints, and the arbitrary arrest of him by the Respondents.
The Supreme Court on 14.03.2012 granted leave to proceed for alleged violation of Article 12(1), 13(1) & 13(2) of the Constitution.
This court having considered the version of each party is more than satisfied that the Petitioners fundamental rights are breached.
The story of the Petitioner is more convincing than the Respondents. It is regrettable that the official Respondents conducted their usual business in the most unacceptable manner.
It is no excuse for the Police to state that the Petitioner was detained until the report of the CEB was forthcoming to the Police.
Is it the position that the Police in this instant was unaware of the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code
Until the arrival of Petitioners Attorney, at the Police, kept the Petitioner in Police custody Why was that The Respondents who held office in the CEB cannot take cover under the law and take pride for their acts done to the Petitioner. The law should never be flouted to such an extent.
Though such unacceptable acts took place some years ago, I wonder whether the CEB has made an attempt to rectify their mistakes, thereafter. Consumers request should take precedent, and it should never be ignored or delayed.
A Government Agency should serve the people, for which it was established by statute, and should not attempt to harm the consumer based on unacceptable proof, Justice Anil Goonaratne observed.
Arrest of a person could be done only according to procedure established by law. I am also inclined to hold that the Petitioner was not produced before the Magistrate within the time required by law. These are basic rights available to a citizen, as per Article 13 of the Constitution. Considering all the above matters, I hold that the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution have been violated by the OIC of Piliyandala police and CEB,Justice Anil Goonaratne further added.

Demonetisation disrupts Indian informal sector - Moodys
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to keep the repo rate at 6% after cutting it by 25 basis points at its last meeting, says Moodys. That vote was 4-2. Declining prices of key rural commodities are primarily the cause for the disinflation trend.
Although food prices are expected to rise over the coming months due to base effects, the forecast of normal rainfall for the monsoon season will likely keep a lid on overall food prices.
Further, Indias growth is decelerating. Demonetisation has disrupted the informal sector of the economy, but investment has also been moribund. Because of low growth and inflation, the RBI will keep an easing bias.

Speaking to the Daily News today the AG said Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama, who is chairing the Ministerial Sub-Committee, assured him that the report would be presented to the next Cabinet meeting, without fail.
The Cabinet deferred approving the final draft of the long overdue National Audit Bill that was submitted in the first week of August, and appointed a six-member committee to look into it.
Its report was expected at the last Cabinet meeting, but as it was not presented, the Cabinet postponed taking up the bill.
The National Audit Bill has undergone 22 revisions since its first draft was compiled in 2004.
The AG said he was yet to be informed of any further amendments proposed to the Bill, adding that there had been no new Amendments proposed by the Sub-Committee as at last week.
The AG noted that certain Ministers have reportedly opposed to the surcharge provision in the Bill that enables recovery of an amount overpaid to a public servant, or a recoupment of any loss caused to the Government for which he is held responsible. The objections they have must be presented in writing. If such objections were raised we would have to revisit the draft, he added.
The AG, convening a special press conference on August 18, appealed to the Government to gazette the long awaited National Audit Bill, observing that the inordinate delay in passing the legislation has hampered work of his Department.
JVP MP and COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti has expressed his intention of presenting the draft Audit Bill to the House as a Private Members Bill as the Government constantly delays it. Handunnetti said the work in this regard is progressing, and added that he hopes to present it to Parliament within this month.

## Title: Ethics and CSR in entrepreneurship
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Finance

Ethics and CSR in entrepreneurship
Organizations can demonstrate social responsibility in numerous ways: they could donate funds to education, human livelihood, arts and culture, underprivileged children, addressing starvation or they can make commitments to reduce their environmental footprint, implement fair trade, sponsor events and work only with suppliers with similar values.
Responsible for curing social ills is a fundamentally insubordinate guideline. This is especially true for small businesses and entrepreneurts, who tend to have more limited resources than their larger counterparts.
In many societies, voluntarily helping others in need is considered a highly moral or ethical act. A famous example for this type of moral behaviour is the Tsunami disaster that affected our country in 2004.
The people gave their contribution with no expectation of benefits in return-not even the expectation that they would be recognized for their charity.
A selfless act of giving, or charity, is a traditional quality in our Sri Lankan culture. Charity requires a voluntarism of self and an elevation of the interests of helping others. In western cultures, what we consider good is based on the ability of a person to consider others before self and to sacrifice personal desires for the betterment of others.
Social responsibility is an ethical thought or theory that an entity, be it an organization or individual, has an obligation to benefit to the society at large. In other way social responsibility is a duty every individual or organization has to perform so as to maintain a balance between the economy and the ecosystem.
It requires sustaining the equilibrium between these two parameters. It pertains not only to business organizations but also to anyone whose action impacts the environment and society. This responsibility can be passive, by avoiding engaging in socially harmful acts, by performing activities that directly advance social goals. This shows the various ways that companies can invest in being socially responsible and the value those actions can bring to the company.
While the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) may be thought of involving large corporations, conducting business through balancing the long-term objectives, decision-making, and behavior of a company with the values, norms, and expectations of society. It is very often small business owners who are asked for gifts and donations in general scenario.
Entrepreneurs and small business owners are often easily accessible to those who would ask for donations and owners may feel it is an obligation to give in fear of losing community support. The question remains as to what level business owners should be expected to contribute a portion of their profits to society. The assumption that business owners have a social responsibility suggests that businesses, as members of society are expected to participate as a social member and enables their existence.
The purpose of an organizations existence, under this model, is to not only look after the interests of the owner, but to also take into account the interests and impacts it has on stakeholders. The model further assumes that businesses must act in a socially responsible manner to fulfill ethical obligations to society.
Organizations can demonstrate social responsibility in numerous ways: they could donate funds to education, human livelihood, arts and culture, underprivileged children, addressing starvation or they can make commitments to reduce their environmental footprint, implement fair trade, sponsor events and work only with suppliers with similar values.
However, real-life applications of CSR have served more to enhance corporate image than to serve as a model for ethical behavior. It will be shown that ethics is not related to philanthropy and that humanity, especially for entrepreneurs and small business owners, to be part of the marketing tool. While ethical behavior is always encouraged and must be maintained by the organization, philanthropy must play a role in developing and supporting the owners brand identity and image within the community.
Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a form of self-regulation to monitor and ensure compliance with the spirit of the law, ethical standards and social norms. The goal of CSR is to embrace responsibility and encourage a positive impact through its activities on stakeholders.
If we assume that organizations must act in a socially responsible manner, then it can be expected that business leaders would seek an accepted standard for responsible behavior. As a result, many businesses have viewed charity as an easily recognizable and quantifiable measure of ethical behavior and use this behavior as a demonstration of the organizations healthiness.
Morally acceptable philanthropy can also be viewed in a strategic sense so that charitable efforts improve the competitive position of the organization. Philanthropy can align social and economic goals and improve a companys long-term business prospects. This sort of targeted philanthropy becomes a way for companies and communities to pursue winwin situations.
Larger businesses use public examples claiming that community support is simply the morally right thing irrespectively organizations that contribute to charitable causes are more positively perceived by the public.
Entrepreneurs and small business owners, seeking to imitate best practice examples announced by large firms, donate organizational funds and other resources to a number of community charities, typically with the assumption they are completing a moral requirement to the community and are exhibiting good ethical behavior.

There are three parts to the discipline of business ethics. They are categorized as personal, professional and corporate. All three are inter-related.
To remain as ethical business of society, the business owner and the business operations should always follow legal requirements and social norms such as follow tax regulations, full filling statutory requirements imposed by the country law in terms of employments, timely obtain proper license and permits, protecting environment, maintaining good health and safety standard, produce or sell quality products and services in reasonable pricing to the highest extent possible, while remaining an effective business operation. Philanthropy may be followed at the decision of the owner, but only to the extent that it can further develop the business.
Ethics are very important values in entrepreneurship ventures. This is particularly essential in decision making process. Ethical morality reminds entrepreneurs to make trustworthy and profitable entrepreneurship decisions that can enhance benefits and preventing harms to the stakeholders.
The entrepreneur must establish a balance among ethical needs, economic feasibility and social responsibility. A managers attitude concerning corporate responsibility tend to be supportive of laws and professional codes of ethics. Entrepreneurs have few reference persons, role models and developed internal ethics codes.
Responsible for curing social ills is a fundamentally insubordinate guideline. This is especially true for small businesses and entrepreneurs, who tend to have more limited resources than their larger counterparts.

Illegal settlers in Nuwarawewa tank  reservation contaminate water
Anuradhapura people in grave dange
The Nuwarawewa reservoir, the main drinking water source for Anuradhapura, is in a devastating state due to illegal squatters at the tank reservation.Illegal constructions including hotels were put up in the area affecting surrounding of the tank.
Anuradhapura Divisional Irrigation Engineer P.U.K. Tilakaratne said the illegal settlers must be removed and their construction have to be demolished to protect the environment and the people in the area.
The farmer organisations have complained to the Anuradhapura Government Agent and the District Agriculture Committee that evacuating takes a very long duration. They said zonal irrigation authorities had no power to take legal action against the illegal settlers.
The land and legal section of the Irrigation Director General that handles the lawsuits against the squatters has no power to carry out preventive measures efficiently, he said.. Nuwarawewa, Tissa Wewa, Abhayawewa, Mahawilachchiya and Mahakanadarawa come under the Anuradhapura Irrigation Division. A recent survey found 2,933 squatters in Nuwarawewa and 161 in the Tissa Wewa tank reservations. Abayawewa tank reservation has 44 and the Mahakanadarawa 20. The Mahawilachchiya tank reservation has 57.
"Three cases against the offenders in the Nuwarawewa reservation were decided against them and we have already demolished one house and two more have to be evacuated. We have to continue the process through the land and legal section at irrigation head office and not at the zonal level, Tilakaratne said. The Engineer said several sewerage systems were opened to the Nuwarawewa and the toilets near the tank contaminated the water. He said some illegal settlers even have land permits. Three Jayaboomi land grants holders dwell in the Nuwarawewa reservation, he said.

"Galle Dialogue", the International Maritime Conference organised by the Sri Lanka Navy for the 8th consecutive year is scheduled to be held at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo.
The Conference will be held on October 9 and 10 with the participation of the Navy Commanders of the other countries and a large turnout of representatives from 38 countries under the Greater Maritime Visibility for Enhanced Maritime Security .
The Navy Media Unit said it was a major challenge today keeping the maritime sphere safe and secure since vast oceans were vulnerable to be utilized by criminals for nefarious activities due to blindness and lack of or sympathetic legal regimes to deal with wrongdoer.
The Unit said that the rapid evolution of maritime security threats and challenges demand a proactive response from the key players who have the responsibility of keeping the oceans safe and secure. As we all act as nodes of a web that is laid over the maritime domain, the role played by stakeholders in protecting the maritime sphere from a wider range of threats is therefore considered crucial.
Though, there are quite a number of agencies that are involved in ensuring maritime security and managing their own affairs/ back yards such as Merchant Vessel traffic, smuggling trails of humans and drugs, and IUU fishing, human trafficking, each of them has their capabilities and capacities focused on different sectors to acquire visibility only in their interested sectors. Therefore, one of the significant challenges that we face today is to explore how best each one of us can work in unison to share the own visible maritime segment with rest of us to minimize Maritime Blindness.
Navy Media Unit said it was in this context that this years Galle Dialogue theme Greater Maritime Visibility for Enhanced Maritime Security has been articulated to pave the way to enhance maritime visibility and address maritime security threats and challenges through a proactive stratagem.

Mastercard launches early detection system
With speed being a critical factor in fighting fraud, Mastercard announced the launch of Early Detection System.
This new service provides issuers with a unique advanced alert for cards and accounts at a heightened risk of fraudulent use based on their exposure in security incidents or data breaches.
The business of stolen data is in the news daily and thieves are getting faster every day. Just last month, 143 million identities were reported as compromised in one data breach, and it can take as little as nine minutes for stolen data posted to the dark web to be used. Knowing that not all compromised accounts will be used fraudulently, and every second counts, Mastercard developed Early Detection System to help financial institutions take action faster, thus preempting more serious attacks.
Using Mastercard network insights, predictive capabilities and a combination of internal and external data sources, Early Detection System determines if a card or account is at risk and sends an alert to the issuer with a quantification of the level of risk.
The issuer then uses the level of risk to more accurately prioritize what action to take - from monitoring transactions more closely to proactively issuing a replacement card.
Knowledge is power, and this service helps issuers act significantly faster and with greater precision to stop potential fraud before it occurs, said Ajay Bhalla, president of enterprise risk and security at Mastercard. Our issuers can now proactively target the fraudulent activity resulting from previously breached or hacked data, helping them reduce costs and maintain the best possible cardholder experience.
Early Detection System is available to issuers globally and captures all types of fraud across all transaction channels.
The system identifies everything from active criminal trading of account data, to identification of cards being tested prior to being used for fraud, to account data that appears at-risk but without sufficient evidence to declare an Account Data Compromise event. This provides issuers with alerts on a much broader set of at-risk accounts potentially 6 to 18 months ahead of traditional alerts.

Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said that the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) will not increase fuel prices despite continuous requests by the Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) for both parties to increase the price of petrol and diesel prices evenly.
LIOC held discussions with me and the Finance Ministry officials requesting permission for an increase in fuel prices. But, I told them not to take such a decision at this juncture. But, if the LIOC increases its prices, we must be ready to cater to the peoples needs without any interruption, Minister Ranatunga said.
The government will not increase fuel prices as it would be a burden to the people eventhough there is a necessity for a fuel price revision, he said
If fuel prices are increased, it would hav an adverse effect on all sectors of the country. Finally, it is the poor public which suffers. That is why the CPC will not increase its prices, he added.

The other as foe History is replete with the horrors of us-vs-them narratives
Currently being watched by riveted and shaken viewers across the US, Ken Burns 10-part documentary, The Vietnam War, is relevant for places and issues far removed from the America and Vietnam of the 1960s and 1970s.
During that wars early period, which was also when India and China fought a short war, many saw the communist world as a global monolith where the Soviet Union, China and North Vietnam harmonised their roles for conquering the world. The Vietnam War shows that what the American forces were up against in Vietnam was not international communism but wounded nationalism. Ho Chi Minh and others like General Giap were Vietnams admired leaders, not agents or followers of the Kremlin or Mao. Foreign intervention, not capitalism, was what Vietnamese men, women and children were resisting. The US lost immense quantities of blood and treasure in Vietnam before recognising that nationalism was a stronger force than ideology. Then the US forgot what it had learnt, and Afghanistan and Iraq followed. Now, Trump appears to threaten Iran and North Korea with devastation.
The need for an enemy seems universal, as is the compulsion to see the foe as evil. The Vietnam War reveals that at least for some American soldiers, despising the Vietnamese was central to their war in southeast Asia. When, from the 1980s, communism seemed to sink below the horizon, the concern of those dependent on a good-versus-evil clash was allayed with the arrival of Islam.
For Americans, Islam arrived on September 11, 2001, wearing a terrifying face. Suddenly the world seemed more dangerous than before, but also less complicated. There was once more a visible evil to unite against, its terror visible on TV screens, its mosques visible in the landscape, its adherents visible, because of their clothes and beards, on the street. Just as yesterday, Russians, Chinese, Vietnamese and Cubans were all, and above all, Communists, today Afghans, Syrians, Pakistanis and Iranians, and dozens of other groups, including the Rohingya, are all, and above all, Muslims.
Muslims and non-Muslims
There is a difference. Customers today of a good-versus-evil show are not confined to the US, the western world, or the capitalist class. As visible foes, Muslims are available in virtually every part of the world. Muslims dont make life easier for themselves when they join in dividing the world between Muslims and non-Muslims. True, many Muslims seem to prefer fighting fellow-Muslims, but they seem to banish any unease about this by assuring themselves that their Muslim foe is not a Muslim; he or she is only pretending to be one, or is not in any case a Muslim of the right sort. Pakistanis now admit that they lost Bangladesh by refusing to see that for East Pakistanis their Bangla identity was a life-and-death question. A common Muslim-ness was hopelessly insufficient for political unity.
Today, on her part, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is in error when, refusing to call the Rohingya by their name, she refers to them simply as Muslims. Whether she realises it or not, she thereby contributes to the Muslim/non-Muslim divide so favoured by the simplifiers of our times, people who yearn for an us-versus-them, good-versus-evil clash, which, as Vietnam showed, can prove extremely costly.
First and foremost, the Rohingya, like the rest of us, are human beings. Unlike the rest of us, they have been forced out of their homes and lands in large numbers. They are Myanmars outcasts, in that terms literal meaning. For India to slam the door against them, and to threaten those of them already in India with deportation, is to display a heartlessness which the world may not quickly forget. The argument that, being Muslim by religion, the Rohingya are actual or potential terrorists and therefore ineligible for entry into India has no logic or law behind it, apart from the fact that it shamelessly squeezes out every drop of humanity.
Law of humanity
The line is also imprudent because it subjects Indians living in dozens of other countries to current and future hazards. Today, they come for the Rohingya. Tomorrow they may come for the Indians, of whom there are many even in Myanmar, in different parts of that land.
Whether they live in India or elsewhere, people of Indian origin have an enormous stake in the legal principle that no one may be discriminated against, or punished, for being linked by blood, ethnicity or religion to a criminal or terrorist.
To welcome a Chakma refugee from Bangladesh, who by religion may be a Buddhist, and a Tamil from Sri Lanka, who perhaps is a Hindu by religion, but deny entry to a Rohingya pushed out of Myanmar, who happens to be a Muslim, would appear to flout the Constitution, not merely the law of humanity.

Our wired future
The bedrock on which our world has been built is communication. From the carrier pigeons of yesteryear to videoconferencing, we have devised various ways to keep in touch with each other. Today, we can video call someone on the other side of the world for free, as long as we like thanks to the power of the Internet that has linked the entire world. We can instantly transfer files and photos, chat by text and voice and shop the entire world all from the comfort of a cozy armchair at home.
But the origin of all this lies in an invention called the telephone, which is now more than 140 years old. The telephone enabled us to call anyone anywhere in the world by dialing a few numbers. Long before radio waves were discovered, telephone signals were sent through wires. Today, we do not need any wires to talk  everyone on the planet has at least two mobile phones and apps such as Whats App and Viber have made video calling as easy as ABC.
This does not mean that the traditional telephone is dead. Far from being as dead as a dodo, the International Direct Dialling (IDD) system is very much alive. No web-based service can still match the quality of the traditional IDD call. Just as the late Arthur C Clarke predicted, an international call is now only marginally more expensive than a local call. And did you know that most of our international conversations (and data) are still sent over the wire across continents, despite the availability of satellites
Sri Lanka has always occupied a pivotal position in the international telecom sphere thanks to its geographic position at the centre of the East-West maritime transport lines. This is why Sri Lanka has been a prime landing spot for the South East Asia  Middle East  Western Europe 5 (SEA-ME-WE) state-of-the-art submarine cable system that can carry both voice and data.
The latest SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable system, for which a landing station was commissioned in Matara by President Maithripala Sirisena this week, spans approximately 20,000 km, offering POP-to-POP (Point of Presence) solutions from Singapore to Europe via France and Italy. The system connects 17 countries and serves as a new platform for development in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) industry.
The conceptualization of the new submarine cable system evolved around the capacity requirements of the various continents to support the next generation of Internet applications. The SEA-ME-WE 5 cable is designed to provide upgradeable transmission facilities by adopting the latest state-of-the-art multiple 100 GBPS technology. When fully loaded, the SEA-ME-WE 5 cable system is capable of carrying a total 24 terabytes per second, the equivalent of transmitting around 4,800 high-definition movies every second. No wireless system can still match these speeds.
Sri Lanka has been in the forefront of communications technology in South Asia. Sri Lanka was the first to introduce Optical Fibre, 3G and 4G and hopefully, will be the first to introduce 5G when this next generation wireless protocol goes on air around 2020 offering up to 100 times faster download and streaming speeds for HD video, data and audio than existing 4G. Local telecom companies have already trailed 4.5G systems, so this target is perfectly achievable.
Wired or wireless, the Internet will be the biggest beneficiary of the coming telecom revolution. There is even a term for the future in which everything and everyone will be connected all the time. It is called the Internet of Things (IoT). Amazons Alexa and Googles Home AI voice assistants are just a preview of the IoT revolution, which will connect up to 50 billion devices from microwave ovens to cars in the next few years. In fact, motoring will be the biggest beneficiary of 5G and IoT, with the industry predicting fully autonomous cars on our roads by 2030.
These autonomous cars require a network that can facilitate multiple interactions between numerous connected devices. The traffic lights, road signs, weather stations, other cars and pedestrian crossings will all send network signals instantaneously to communicate road conditions to the car, allowing for a safer driving experience. The amount of bandwidth required to connect these devices together is not available on the 4G network. Also, autonomous cars will have the necessary reaction time to engage the brakes inches from obstacles, a feat simply not possible on the 4G network.
Our regulations must be flexible enough to allow for this rapid expansion in telecom capacity and capability. Our lawmakers have shown that they are among the most forward thinking in South Asia when it comes to telecom expansion and regulation. The Government recently slashed taxes on data rates and is on a drive to make more free Wi Fi hotspots available. Telecom devices and related products such as laptops attract little or no duties and taxes. The Government has also introduced the Smart Classroom concept for senior classes which will showcase future educational concepts, most of which are already feasible. A brave new world is coming and we must all be ready for it.

Philippines hails US as top ally
THE PHILIPPINES: The Philippines military chief hailed the United States as his nations number one ally and announced a return of regular war games, following President Rodrigo Dutertes call for warmer ties.
Duterte last week vowed to be friendly with the United States, signalling an end to relentless criticism that included a vow to end all joint military exercises.
Military Chief General Eduardo Ano, returning from Hawaii where he met US Pacific Command chief Admiral Harry Harris last week, said Thursday the allies had agreed to increase joint military exercises for 2018 after they were scaled down this year.
The president said: I want to be friendlier to the US. So we have a closer relationship and more exercises, Ano told reporters in Manila.
He (Duterte) said to continue engagement with the United States. They are still our number one ally. Ano said the joint exercises next year would focus on counter-terrorism, disaster response and even territorial defence.
As he sought to loosen his nations alliance with the United States, Duterte also looked to build warmer relations with China and Russia.
During a visit to Beijing a year ago he announced his nations separation from the United States.
He later explained he was angry at Obama for criticising his war on drugs, which has since seen thousands killed and led rights groups to warn Duterte may be orchestrating a crime against humanity.
Duterte said last week the dispute was water under the bridge as he thanked the United States for helping the Philippines fight Islamic militants who have occupied parts of the southern city of Marawi since May 23.
The US has provided intelligence, weapons and training to local forces trying to retake Marawi.
The fighting has claimed more than 900 lives and raised fears the Islamic State group is trying to establish a Southeast Asian base in the Philippines.
Ano said on Thursday the Philippines would still pursue closer defence ties with China.
Ano was speaking at a ceremony at which China turned over 3,000 assault rifles and ammunition worth 168 million pesos ($3.2 million) to the Philippine military for use in fighting terrorism. The US is not our enemy. China is not our enemy. Our utmost priority is the interest of the country, Ano said. - AFP

Plans to sell out M2 block in Mannar in 2021
The Petroleum Exploration Development Plan under the directive of Minister of Petroleum Resources Development Arjuna Ranatunga and the Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat (PRDS) plans to sell out the M2 block in Mannar in year 2021 for exploration of natural gas, for commercial operations.
This is subsequent to a continuation with Joint Study with TOTAL of France off the east coast  Blocks JS5 & JS6.
The block contains two natural gas and condensate discoveries (Dorado and Barracuda) both of which were discovered by exploration activities in 2011. The volumetric analysis of these two discoveries has indicated a combined potential reservoir capacity in excess of 2 TCF (Trillion Cubic feet) of natural gas and 10 million BBL (barrels) of condensate.
In addition in discoveries, the Mannar basin has sufficiently thick and mature sedimentary deposits that may yield high quality oil and natural gas which would be adequate for the next sixty years.
Initial studies of well data and regional studies indicate that the source rocks have the potential to generate 5 billion barrels of oil and 9 Trillion Cubic feet of natural gas. PRDS has already carefully mapped this risked potential that is yet to be explored and verified.
During 2008  2015 a sum of US$ 26 million has been spent on petroleum exploration activities for local capacity building and procurement of local goods & services by the Operator of block M2 in Mannar (ex-Cairn SL 2007-01-001). Nearly 17 local suppliers transacted US$ 18 million services during this period demonstrating a slow emergence of a new industry. Four local universities are assisted and guided to establish upstream petroleum related course modules. The M2 block exploration program itself is a US$ 240 million worth of a petroleum data asset, conclusive of two gas discoveries.
The government hopes to open Block M2 as part of a limited tender offer, to find a partner to appraise and develop the discovery of natural gas, as well as to explore for additional prospects. (IH)

Plea to reconstruct Ginigathena-Peragolla road
The non-construction of the side-way draining system at a few places along a road from near the Ginigathena Central College on the Ginigathena-Peragolla bus route to Gonawala in the Ambagamuwa DS division in the Nuwara Eliya district has caused a great inconvenience to residents in the area.
The road was constructed by a private company under the supervision of the Road Development Authority. It was carried out under the Integrated Road Development Project implemented by the Higher Education and Highways Ministry at a cost of Rs. 28.95 million funded by the Asian Development Bank.
The residents of several villages including Gonawala, Medilla,Bogalkande and Kotahela said one-km-long road was constructed on a mountain with a deep drainage system but the non-construction of a drain at a few places has attributed to the situation where the rain water flowing down from the hill to the road.
Schoolchildren and parents have to wade in the muddy water during rainy days.
Residents have complained about the situation many a time to authorities and the minister but no action was taken to date.
They urge the Higher Education and Highways Minister and the authorities to take immediate steps to remedy the situation.

Production is taking in place Asia only because there was consumption demand in the United States and the West. Therefore, the production was outsourced to Asia. This model is changing and has changed, to near-shoring and re-shoring which is placing a huge challenge to the carriage of goods by sea, out of Asia, said Chairman Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake.
He also stated that the outsourcing model into Asia had been challenged due to increase in cost in Asia, loss of employment in the US and Europe and the adverse situation pertaining to the creation of new employment in the developed world.
We need to understand that the demand for the carriage of goods is a derived demand and it is derived out of demand for trade. Ports and shipping have to follow trade, he said.
Dr. Dissanyake made these statements at a recent presentation titled Why Ports Have to be Demand Driven
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce had organized the seminar at its auditorium with a series of presentations on the Hambantota Port and the Industrial Zone. Several experts and professionals in the maritime transportation business expressed views through presentations at the seminar.
Dr. Dissanyake said due to the huge investment required, the port had to be demand driven and the ports in Sri Lanka were ideally positioned to seize opportunities provided they continued to create the competitive advantage required in the changing global environment.
Dhara Wijayatilake  Secretary General and CEO of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce moderated the seminar.

Religious lobby cannot dictate public health policy : Dr. Udagama
Human Rights Commission Chairperson Dr. Deepika Udagama, advocating on the revision of abortion laws in the country stressed that the public policy on health matters should not allowed to be dictated by religious lobbyists.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, Dr. Udagama said her Commission is in full agreement with the draft changes to the law to permit abortion under strict conditions in the case of rape and if the foetus is malformed.
Joining in the on-going debate on relaxing abortion law, the Chairperson observed the public policy on health ought to be made on the basis of strong medical and secular grounds and not on religious beliefs.
The Commission respects the religious views and freedom of speech of everybody, but these are issues that ought not to be decided on the basis of religious beliefs. Those who have such religious beliefs can make personal choices even if abortion is permitted on the above mentioned grounds, she noted.
Dr. Udagama, observing that the abortion is a public health issue that affects the reproductive rights of women, highlighted the need to have a modern and healthy debate over it in Sri Lanka. We have to look at what is going on in the rest of the world as well. Sri Lanka has already undertaken obligations in this regard by ratifying the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), she said.
She recalled even in 1995, when the Government proposed an Amendment to the Penal Code with the aim to relax abortion laws, it could not be presented to Parliament due to a religious lobby. The discussion on abortion laws has been there for decades, but it has always been centered around religious beliefs. It is time we think seriously on the health rights dimension of this problem.
We believe it is a very important reproductive health issue for women and medical sciences do back up this position, she added.

Sampanthan speaks on merger of N&E with UK Minister: Promotes pluralism within a sovereign state
Leader of the Opposition and Tamil National Alliance Leader R. Sampanthan who met with visiting UK Minister of State for Asia and Pacific Mark Field called for a merger of North and East provinces citing the two provinces largely represent Tamil majority adding that the constitution will provide for the protection preventing separation.
The majority Sinhala community need not be afraid of the merger of these two provinces as there will be a Constitutional protection preventing any move towards separation.
The power-sharing arrangements will be worked out within a United, Undivided and Indivisible Sri Lanka, Sampanthan pointed out to the Minister.
The Opposition Leader further said we are seeking an arrangement that will enable people to exercise powers related to their social, cultural, economic, and political matters based on the principle of sovereignty of the people as citizens of this country. But this power should not be taken back in anyway.
The Opposition Leader who met the Minister at Westminster House in Colombo elaborated on the political situation in the country adding that the TNA has genuinely participated in the process of framing a new constitution.
From 1957 onwards there had been various attempts made to recognise the pluralism in this country, but unfortunately, none of those efforts came to be realized, he said. The need for a power sharing arrangement has been in discussion over 30 years since 1957. Only in 1987 with the involvement of Indian Government for the very first time a power sharing arrangement was recognised in the constitution of this country. From that time, onwards steps were taken by every successive Government to address the National question and evolve a final solution, he added.
Framing a new Constitution is an important task in finding a resolution to the national questionSampanthan said adding that failure would result in a recurrence of violence.
Speaking of the consequences of violence in the past, Sampanthan said, fifty percent of the Sri Lankan Tamils live outside the country and if we dont find a lasting solution more people will leave the country he cautioned.
Answering a question regarding the role of the diaspora members, Sampanthan said that the Diaspora is adopting a pragmatic approach, they too would like to see an acceptable resolution to this issue.
Sampanthan highlighted the importance of the role of the International community at this juncture and said that the United Kingdom must take all efforts to support these processes to see a positive end and also to ensure that the Government of Sri Lanka delivers on urgent matters like release of private lands, issue of Missing Persons and Political Prisoners.
The British Minister assured the TNA Leader of the constructive engagement of the UK government and wished the TNA leader all success for all his efforts in framing a new Constitution.
Britiah High Commissioner to Sri Lanka James Dauris and other High Commission officials were present at the meeting.

SLT inaugurates Submarine Cable Landing Station in Matara
Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) inaugurated a Submarine Cable Landing Station (SCLS) in Matara, aiming to become a hub of communication in Asia, SLT Chairman P.G. Kumarasingha said.
In line with the inauguration of the SCLS, SLT laid the foundation stone for a Cable depot in Galle.
The Chairman added that SLT has already completed the cable-laying process as a partnered project. The undersea submarine cable project called 'SEA-ME-WE-5,' will increase the data-transferring speed by tenfold. This is the fifth underwater submarine cable of the SLT.
The completion of its partnered project, the 'South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 5' (SEA-ME-WE 5), is expected to increase its international bandwidth capacity by tenfold, for the future requirements of the country as well as the South Asian region. With this global initiative, SLT will further strengthen its position as the only ICT solutions provider in the country having multiple global connectivity options with a gigantic bandwidth capacity that is adequate to cater to the requirements for more than 25 years ahead, the Chairman said.
This futuristic project is in collaboration with the country's vision for the future to empower the ICT super highway towards becoming the digital hub of the region.
The SEA-ME-WE 5 project, already completed with the partnership of 19 global operators, has designed a future-ready network that is capable of delivering a 48 Tbps (48,000 Gbps) global bandwidth capacity to Sri Lanka by facilitating both east and west cables, the Chairman added.
He further pointed out that the landing of this international cable at Matara will be a key milestone as well as a landmark for the telecom industry of the country.
The SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable system will further enhance the uninterrupted connectivity to the world since any redundancies of the existing submarine cable systems (SEA-ME-WE 3 and SEA-ME-WE 4) can be routed through SEA-ME-WE 5 cable system. Asked what the direct and the indirect benefits of this project, the Chairman replied that the new cable system will enable Sri Lanka to leverage on its strategic marine geographical location in achieving the countrys strategic goals. Moreover, this global project will have a positive impact on the overall growth of the countrys economy. On the economic front, a high-speed broadband environment will encourage higher GDP, enhanced exports, increased productivity, inward migration and modernizing of other sectors. At all micro, small and macro-economic levels, it will reduce transaction costs, increase market coverage and competitiveness and create significant opportunities for job-creation and income-generation.
In addition, it will foster economic growth and development through affordable, reliable and seamless global communications, he said.
This initiative will be one of the key enablers in achieving the move towards an inclusive digital economy and a smart Sri Lanka, he added.
The SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable system, spanning approximately 20,000 km, links Singapore, all the way to Europe via France and Italy.
It connects 16 countries altogether, serving as the new platform for future business ICTs.
The SEA-ME-WE 5 cable system is designed to provide upgradeable transmission facilities by adopting the latest state-of-the-art 100 Gbps WDM coherent technology.
Speaking on the Cable Depot in Galle, the Chairman said that this is the first state-of-the-art Submarine Cable Depot the South Asia.

SP public servants still await special distress loan
Southern Province public servants said they did not receive the special distress loan assured by the Public Administration and Management Ministry circular number 14/2017 dated 28 06.2017.
Permanent state employees affected by recent natural disasters were guaranteed a distress loan worth six times value of their monthly salary that they have to settle in 36 months and the temporary employees to the value equivalent to their three months salary that they have to settle in 18 months, the circular stated.
The circular stated that the distress loan should be granted strictly to the government employees who suffered in the recent floods and landslides in the province in May 2017 and by August 31, the loan scheme should be stopped. However, it is alleged that provincial state workers were not granted the loan.
An official of Southern Province Chief Secretariat said the media that the treasury did not release the fund for the loan scheme despite their official requests and subsequent reminders.
The Secretary to the Treasury announced that they had already released Rs. 487 million to the District Secretaries of Galle, Matara and Hambantota respectively. But the District Secretaries refuted the claim, the Southern Province Chief Secretariat official said.
Galle District Secretary S.T. Kodikara said he received fund only for the development work but not for granting distress loans.
The Southern Provincial employees charged that it was an official discrimination and injustice on them as the central government employees in the province had been promptly rewarded the loan.

We are waiting for the approval of the Economic Policies and Planning Ministry and the Management Services Department to recruit more teachers. If the approval was given, it would resolve the graduates' unemployments, Bandara said.Recently, unemployed graduates in the province protested demanding the employments in the State sector and met the Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake and discussed their issues.

## Title: Visa to launch QR payment system to Sri Lanka soon

Visa to launch QR payment system to Sri Lanka soon
Governments of India and Sri Lanka are encouraging digitization and this would result in a huge growth in cashless payments in the future, said Shivakumar Sriraman, Chief Risk Officer, Visa India and South Asia.
Nearly 20-25 billion devices across the planet will be connected by smart devices by 2020 in some form of fashion and this too would help to promote digitization, he said.
"If digitization was to increase in India by 10%, then the estimated cost of cash would be 1.5% of GDP. So, 10% increase means that by 2022, India will save Rs. 4 lakh crores. This is the size of the savings potential for digitization. We must take steps; we are 8, we must move to 1," Sriraman said.
In comparison with China, 45% of China is already digitized. However, only 8% of India is digitized, which presents a huge potential to grow.
The governments adoption of digital payments will be critical in driving Indias digital dream. It is both a challenge and an opportunity because the biggest consumer of cash is the Government of India. Out of the 900 billion or so of PCE, the citizen to government payments such as taxes, water bills, electricity bills, MTNL, etc., amount to about US$ 150 billion. Less than 2% is digital. Indian Railways which is largest ecommerce merchant in India, income tax, corporation tax, water tax, etc., are valid examples.
India represents perhaps the single largest cash displacement opportunity in the planet. Indias PCE is about 60% of its GDP, in dollar terms it is about a trillion dollars and less than 8% of that is digital.
At Visa, our mission is to help digital payments replace cash as a mechanism for payment. If you look at countries like Sweden, they are already in excess of 90% digital payment penetration while India we are still 7-8%. I would say this gap is the potential that all of us have. I think we are at the cusp of what is a significant decadal opportunity, Sriraman said.
The size of the challenge and the opportunity in India is too large for one player to take on himself, whether its Visa, RuPay, MasterCard, or anyone else.
In terms of debit activation rates in India, 90% of all debit card transactions are made on an ATM, as per the RBI data.
The interesting thing from Indias perspective is that we have about surplus of 830 million debit cards. The basic understanding that one needs to input four digits to withdraw cash. Therefore, using the same payment credential, to put it into a machine and type the same four digits and the transaction is over, its an easy education from a consumer perspective.
Visa is really excited about the potential of debit cards in the country; the use of debit cards is increasing. I am not using a debit card. I am using debit credentials. Those credentials can be used in QR. This is the first operable QR system in the world. It will be shortly launching in Sri Lanka as well.
QR is a simple yet powerful solution with great potential to shift consumers and merchants from cash to digital payments for everyday spends. It provides the speed, security and convenience that cash payments cannot match. With the common standards, coupled with the low-cost acceptance method, QR payments can enable Indias financial inclusion.
We have seen the merchant base in India expanding from 1.57 million in November, to 2.6 million merchants now and in Sri Lanka too this segment is increasing.
India is witnessing a change in the way digital payments and financial services are delivered to consumers. The key drivers of this change includes a seismic shift in the way consumers shop, pay, and manage their money (driven primarily by the ubiquity in connected devices) and the emergence of rich commerce experiences with payment embedded as part of this digital experience.
Data suggests that there are between 14 to 30 million merchants in some form in the country. The current numbers for BharatQR adoption stands at 2.5 million merchants, and for a country of Indias length, breadth and diversity, this count is not even scratching the surface.
The medium and the SME sector in India is the least organized in terms of availability of formal finance, which is one of the reasons why the NBFC price to book valuation is high. But the NBFCs can lend only 5% to 10%; however the merchants dont have a payroll statement or a cash flow statement.
The interesting thing about fintech is that one cant lose electronic payments so it can be used as a surrogate to impute gross margin, profitability and therefore really increase the access to working capital and formal finance, said Cietan Kitney, Head of Asia Pacific Merchant Sales & Solution, Visa. "Not only is finance expensive but it is also not available. Finance is expensive because NPAs are high. Once the digital footprint grows, the finance rates can be efficient. It will be higher for a defaulter but it will be lower for someone with a good credit score," he said.
In India, there are two reasons why we feel optimistic about merchants adopting digital payments. First, with the monthly GST and reporting, etc., there is an electronic trail is being created. Second, the appetite for SME lending in India is high because it is underpenetrated. Anybody who leaves a digital footprint gets more enquiries, supply efficiency and access to formal finance. We think it is going to be a significant positive drive.
As the leader in payments, it is imperative that Visa enables its clients to meet consumer demand and help them keep up with the pace of innovation in digital commerce, Kitney said.
