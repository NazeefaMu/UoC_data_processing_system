US lawmakers oppose 92 per cent cut in aid to Sri Lanka

Citing the geographical and strategic location of Sri Lanka, a Senate committee has opposed Trump Administrations proposal of a drastic 92 per cent cut in American aid to Sri Lanka.
Given the geostrategic importance of the country, the Committee does not support the Presidents budget request for Sri Lanka, which proposed a 92 per cent reduction in assistance from the prior fiscal year, the Senate Appropriations Committee said in a report passing the annual State appropriations bill for the fiscal year 2018, beginning October 1.
The appropriations bill, which landed on the Senate floor yesterday for consideration, seeks USD 43 million for Sri Lanka. This includes USD 35 million as economic support fund, USD 6.8 million for non-proliferation and anti-terrorism and USD 500,000 in foreign military financing and an equal amount for training of military personnel.
The Committee recognises and supports the efforts of the Government of Sri Lanka to advance democracy and the rule of law, and encourages further steps to address the underlying causes of the armed conflict by promoting justice and reconciliation, the Senate Committee said in its report. The Senate committee on its report said that Sri Lanka is strategically positioned along key shipping lanes and emerging from decades of conflict. The House Appropriations Committee has also passed its Foreign Appropriations Bill, but defers from that of its Senate bill on Sri Lanka. Last week during a Congressional hearing, lawmakers had expressed concern over massive cut in US aid to Sri Lanka.
In Sri Lanka, US foreign assistance will be cut by 92 per cent, mostly from accounts that have supported programs to promote the rule of law, democratic reforms, post-Civil War reconciliation and related efforts, rued Congressman Ted Yoho, Chairman of House Foreign Affairs Sub Committee on Asia and the Pacific.
These programs are cost-effective ways to contribute to Sri Lankas transformation while pursuing a partnership and strategic lead critical locations, he said.
Even at their height in 2016, US assistance commitments to Sri Lanka were about 42.5 million, and thats a bit less than half the cost of a single F-35 fighter jet. That seems like a reasonable investment to gain a friend in one of the worlds most critical sea lanes, Yoho said.
While were forming a large Millennium Challenge Corporation compact was Sri Lanka, the MCC will focus on economic activities. Im concerned that by changing course so drastically, we want to make sure that were not throwing away the investments weve already made in Sri Lanka, leaving a gap in the democracy and governance programs Sri Lanka badly needs, and potentially forcing the closure of our USAID mission, said the US lawmaker.
For the fiscal year 2018, the Trump Administration has requested USD 3.4 million in foreign assistance for Sri Lanka. It focuses on strong support for security cooperation and enhanced strategic trade controls, while contributing to Sri Lankas progress toward becoming a mine-impact-free nation by 2020.
Additionally, the MCC is developing a compact with Sri Lanka after it successfully passed the MCC policy scorecard in 2016. In June, MCC approved an initial USD 7.4 million to study potential projects and conduct due diligence work in the transport and land sectors. MCC is working closely with the Government of Sri Lanka to bring a compact for Board approval in 2018, the State Department said.

'Wonder Woman' Sequel: Patty Jenkins Officially Set to Return as Director

Patty Jenkins is returning forWonder Woman 2.
After an unusually lengthy and tough negotiation, the director has closed a deal with Warner Bros. to helm, co-write and produce the sequel to the movie sensation of the summer.
The deal is precedent-setting, making Jenkins the highest-paid female filmmaker in history, though getting to this point was challenging, according to one source.
Jenkins came on toWonder Womanas a replacement for director Michelle McLaren, who left the project over creative differences. But she became an indispensable figure and, along with star Gal Gadot, the face of the movie in the months before its June opening.
But Jenkins only had a deal for one movie.
When the film became an immediate hit, lassoing over $103 million in its opening weekend, Jenkins and her camp found themselves in a very enviable position. Negotiations began for her return after that first weekend but dragged on even as the movie showed remarkable staying power, becoming a true (and rare for summer 2017) phenomenon. The pic grossed over $402 million domestically and has topped the $800 million mark worldwide.
Sources say Jenkins will receive directing and writing fees in the high seven figures (think somewhere in the $7 million to $9 million range) onWonder Woman 2but, more significantly, will have a considerable backend. (At her peak, filmmaker Nancy Meyers earned in the $5 million range, according to sources.) The deal is a superheroic leap for Jenkins, who was paid $1 million for directing the initialWonder Womanbut was looking to get something more on the level of Zack Snyder's pay after he helmedMan of Steel,according to sources. Just asWonder Womanbroke barriers for superhero movies, Jenkins' deal breaks a glass ceiling for women directors.
Gadot already is attached to the follow-up, which Warner Bros.has dated for Dec. 13, 2019.

Operationalize Office on Missing Persons, replace PTA, fast track release of lands held by military : Zeid

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Husseinon Mondayurged the Sri Lankan Government to swiftly operationalize the Office on Missing Persons, replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and fast track the release of lands held by the military.
Hussein, making the opening statement at the 36th session of UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva, gave an update of human rights issues in 40 countries.
Referring to Sri Lanka in the course of his speech, Hussein reiterated his request to replace the PTA with a new law in line with international human rights standards.
He also emphasized the need to fast track the release of land occupied by the military and resolving of long-pending cases registered under the PTA.
In the North, protests by victims indicate their growing frustration over the slow pace of reforms. I encourage the Government to act on its commitment in Resolution 30/1 to establish transitional justice mechanisms, and to establish a clear timeline and benchmarks for the implementation of these and other commitments, he stated.
This should not be viewed by the Government as a box-ticking exercise to placate the Council, but as an essential undertaking to address the rights of all its people. The absence of credible action in Sri Lanka to ensure accountability for alleged violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law makes the exercise of universal jurisdiction even more necessary, he added.
Sri Lanka at the UNHRC 34th session held in March this year received a two-year extended timeline to fulfill its commitments undertaken in the 2015 resolution. Sri Lanka co-sponsored the resolution in this regard and it was adopted without a vote.
Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the UN in Geneva led by Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha represents Sri Lanka at the 36th session of the Council fromSeptember 11-29.
Hussein in his opening remarks gave priority concern to deteriorating human right situation in Rakhine State in Myanmar, adding that over 270,000 people have fled to Bangladesh in less than three weeks according to the reports reaching the UNHRC.
Many more people reportedly remain trapped between Myanmar and Bangladesh. ...We have received multiple reports and satellite imagery of security forces and local militia burning Rohingya villages, and consistent accounts of extrajudicial killings, including shooting fleeing civilians he stated.
Turning to the subject of migration, Hussein expressed his concerns over the US Governments decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programmein six months time.
I am disturbed by the increase in detentions and deportations of well-established and law-abiding immigrants.  Some migrants, including longstanding residents, are now so frightened of expedited deportation they refrain from accessing police protection and courtrooms, he stated referring to latest developments under the Trump administration.
The High Commissioner in his speech also discussed key concerns in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Cambodia, Yemen, Syria, Egypt, Bahrain, Venezuela, the United States, Turkey, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Mali among others.
The High Commissioner, recalling that he had entered the final year of his current mandate, stated that he would discharge with vigour and determination in the remaining year.

India raises 'offensive' lamb advert with Australia

India has lodged a diplomatic protest with Australia over an advert depicting the Hindu god Ganesha enjoying lamb.
The TV advert, by a meat industry lobby group, portrays figures from several religions sitting down to a meal.
It has caused anger within the Hindu community in Australia because Ganesha is never depicted eating meat.
The High Commission of India in Canberra said it had made a "demarche" to three Australian government departments.
It also urged Meat & Livestock Australia (MLA) to withdraw the advertisement because many people considered it "offensive and hurting their religious sentiments".
"A number of community associations have also registered their protest with government of Australia and Meat and Livestock Australia," the high commission said in a statement.
The advert shows religious figures including Jesus, Buddha and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard talking and eating at a table. It makes a brief reference that the Prophet Muhammed "cannot make it".
Australia's Advertising Standards Bureau said the advert had attracted more than 30 complaints relating to "a number of faiths".
The Hindu Council of Australia said it was a "crude and deplorable attempt" to use images of Ganesha to promote lamb consumption.
One online petition to ban the advert has attracted more than 4,400 signatures.
Australian man Kapil Sachdeva told the BBC he had started the petition after seeing widespread anger on social media.
He also criticised the advert for being released days after the Hindu festival of Ganesh Chaturthi, which celebrates Ganesha's birthday.
The MLA defended the advert last week, saying it had aimed to promote diversity and unity.
"The campaign features gods, prophets and deities from across a wide range of religions alongside atheism, in a clearly fantastic nature, with the intent of being as inclusive as possible," spokesman Andrew Howie said in a statement.
"Our intent is never to offend, but rather acknowledge that lamb is a meat consumed by a wide variety of cultures and capture how the world could look if people left their differing views at the door and came to the table with open arms, and minds."
Last year, the group drew controversy for an Australia Day advertcriticised as offensiveto both vegans and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.

Killing of 27 inmates at Welikada Prison; Writ petition re-fixed for support

The Court of Appeal today re-fixed for support for October 17, a writ petition which sought an order directing the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and Director of the CID to commence an investigation into the Welikada prison riot in 2012 resulting in the death of 27 prisoners.
When the petition came up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne, counsel who appeared on behalf of the petitioner sought a further date to support the petition.
Sudesh Nandimal Silva who was in remand custody at the time of the alleged incidents took place had filed this writ petition citing Commissioner General of Prisons, Director of CID, Inspector General of Police, Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs and the Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioner stated that he was wishing to bring to the attention of the Court what he saw and was within his personal knowledge of the said tragic incidents for the purpose of obtaining the reliefs.
On November 9, 2012 at about 1.00 pm the petitioner and other prisoners at Welikada prison received information that personnel from the Army and STF were about to enter the prison to conduct a search operation. The petitioner got to know that here was an argument between prison officials and a contingent TID, STF waiting at the gate of the prison on the procedure related to the search operation.
The petitioner stated that the prison was in the control of the Army until 10 am on November 10, 2012. By that time 27 of the prison inmates had been killed by STF/Army/TID/Prison Intelligence. The petitioner has made a complaint to the CID on February 2, 2015.
The petitioner stated that although four years has lapsed since the brutal killings of these prisoners no action has yet been taken by the police or the Attorney General to conduct the investigation and prosecute the offenders.
This petition was filed through senior counsel K.S. Ratnavale and Counsel Senaka Perera.

Premier proposes increase in intake of students to Sri Lanka Law College

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has released a proposal containing measures to increase the intake of students to the Sri Lanka Law College and to further develop legal studies in Sri Lanka.
The Premier released the proposal in response to a request made by the Sri Lanka Bar Association in his capacity as the National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister at the Prime Ministers Office in Colombo, yesterday.
The proposal was made following an extensive study carried out by the Prime Ministers Office, which revealed that the number of lawyers in Sri Lanka stands at a minimum, relative to the population of Sri Lanka.
The proposal suggests increasing the student intake to the Sri Lanka Law College in order to mitigate the prevailing shortage of lawyers in the country and ensured that this decision will pave the way for a society of more law-abiding citizens.
Furthermore the proposal deduced that the high cut off mark and the limited amount of opportunities vacated to peruse law studies as reasons for the current shortage of lawyers in Sri Lanka.
In 2016 statistics, it revealed that 8,432 students have lost the opportunity to enter in to the government law school due to the high cut off mark and even though 5,135 students have applied to follow the curriculum only 239 students have been qualified.
To mitigate this shortcoming the proposal suggested establishing more law schools, introducing new subjects related to law studies and conducting examinations under the direct supervision of the Sri Lanka Examinations Commissioner General and the Sri Lanka Constitutional Assembly to ensure the standard of law studies.
