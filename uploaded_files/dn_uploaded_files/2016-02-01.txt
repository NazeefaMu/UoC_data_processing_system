[APPRECIATIONS - (01-02-2016)]

MEL GUNASEKERA:
You cared so much for the people around you
The painful memory of that horrible day - February 2, 2014, the darkest day in the lives of our family has dawned again...
We are forced to relive that gruesome day, when you left us all in a matter of 20 minutes. To me your eldest cousin and all of us in the Malawana / Gunasekera family this day will haunt us for the rest of our lives.
On a personal note, to me February 1 - St. Bridget's Day will now always be a painful day. This year it will be especially painful and emotional to me, as the school day celebrations, Holy Mass, and the March Past won't be held in the Hockey Field unlike in the past years, but in the Primary School grounds beside the Montessori which is the very place you spent your final hours in this world on the Feast of St. Bridget, February 1, 2014.
The school choir (of which you were also once a member when in school) will be positioned co-incidentally in the place, in the Primary grounds to sing for the Mass, where ironically you stood for the last time chatting to me, and your friends, classmates and your teachers on your last day on earth. God planned and destined that you came personally to say goodbye to St. Bridget's on her feast day and to all those you loved.
Recalling our close bond during your childhood and my early teen years at Nawala, how you sat on my lap in the school bus, with your baby chatter in heavy British accent (acquired from your play school in the UK) without a care in the world.
Whenever we missed the school bus, your Thathi - Uncle Marcus took us both on his scooter with you in front enjoying the ride, and me on the pillion with my school books, we travelled at full speed to get to school by 7.30, and once inside the primary gate I used to carry you with your bag and drink bottle and run to the Montessori, leave you in your class, and run to my class in the Upper school. Your days in the Primary School especially in the Choir and band with Miss Lorna, and also the Upper School Choir and Western Band were treasured moments, where your musical talents shone.
These loving memories engulf me and hurt me during these days as I prepare to celebrate our school day- the Feast of St. Bridget on February 1 with the School Choir and the Western Band, walking around the very place you bade me farewell in the Primary grounds.
The unusual expression in your eyes that night, gazing at me intently, with your head tilted to a side on February 1, 2014, after which you hugged me and kissed me saying "Good night Priyanthi Akki, Bye God Bless, take care, love to Mariella."
The memory of your voice and final words will echo in my heart, and bring tears to my eyes for the rest of my life. Meli you cared so much for the people around you, and so gentle that you would never hurt a fly. You loved your friends and family and no matter how hard you worked, you were always there whenever someone needed you, to go the extra mile.
The Catholic Church celebrates the feast of the Presentation of Our Lord on February 2, the day commemorating Mother Mary and St. Joseph carrying Baby Jesus in to the temple and offering Him to the Father.
Simeon the Prophet received Jesus from the hands of His parents Mary and Joseph, and told Mother Mary: "This Child is destined to be rise and fall of many, and a sword will pierce your own heart" And it's incredible that such a kind hearted Angel like you, suffered 54 wounds on your body in a matter of 20 minutes, at the merciless hands of your inhuman murderer at the very moment, your Ammi and Thathi were offering you to the Lord at Holy Mass during the Offertory and Consecration on that Sunday Morning, February 2.
It is humanly impossible to explain or fathom the plan and purpose of God. All I can say is your death was a reflection of the sufferings of Jesus on Calvary while Mother Mary remained at the foot of the cross praying. It is this immense faith in God and His Mother Mary that that keep your parents and brother strong, after your tragic end.
Meli, I know that if you are here today, you would be telling us all to cheer up, and to think about how wonderful your life was. You would want us to celebrate your life and not be sad about losing you. You touched our hearts with so many things. The hearts of your Ammi Manel, Thathi Marcus and brother are filled with so much pain. We know you are watching over them and dwelling in their midst unseen to human eyes, carrying them on Angels wings. After you left us, Radhika has been a gift of God and also your gift to the family, showering them with love and care, being a rock and great support to your parents and brother in your absence.
As two years have passed, we pray with all our hearts, ask our loving God that Divine Justice will have the last word, even though we know you will not come back. The wounds in the hearts of your parents and loved ones will never heal as memories of the sparkle and twinkle in your eyes, your laughter which we will cherish and keep a flow. Rest in the peace of Christ our darling cousin Meli. We love you and You will live on in our lives forever.

John Dhanapala:
He stood tall
I was much saddened to receive an overseas call from my friend H.P. Wijewardhane that our mutual friend John Dhanapala had passed away.
Dane as he was known to us entered the Arts Faculty of the University at Peradenya from Richmond College, Galle. We first met in Marrs Hall but it was in Ramanathan Hall that I came to know him much better.
Having passed out before me, he became a teacher. It was during the long vacation before our final year that he hosted me and my other close friend W.M.K. Wijetunge (later Professor of History) when we visited his home at Thihagoda, Matara in the course of a cycle tour covering four provinces in the mid fifties.
A year or two later I came to appreciate his gentle and graceful ways when we worked together as members of the tutorial staff at Trinity College, Kandy. The British Principal who made it a habit of visiting class rooms to judge for himself the quality of teaching on the part of the untrained teachers complemented him for his high standard of teaching.
This was probably why Dane chose pedagogy for a career while we birds of passage were looking for government jobs which were more remunerative. There was a mild surprise to the students and teachers when he broke ranks by donning the national dress in place of the usual western dress worn by the teachers in the Upper School of this century old public school which cherished and nurtured western cultural values.
More on the diminutive side he stood tall among senior teachers like Gordon Burrows, Hilary Abeyratne, Sahayam, Sinnathamby, Daniel, Toughie Silva, Jacob, RL Kannangara whom I came to know during my short stint there.
He stuck to this noble profession teaching in two more schools here, his alma mater Richmond College and Royal College, Colombo. Retiring prematurely he obtained employment as a teacher in a Catholic school in Pakistan.
He was kept in employment by the Marist Brothers for almost two decades although he was not a Catholic being a Methodist by conviction.
Even after returning from the long stint in Pakistan, Dane chose to continue teaching religion on a voluntary basis in a former missionary, now government controlled school in Kotte. On the last occasion I spoke to him, about a year ago, he tried to recall the lines of the Sinhala songs and Latin hymns teacher Lionel Perera and I sang in harmony recorded by Rev. Eliot on the tape recorder and relayed over the amplifiers during the carnival nights at Trinity College.
Our fading and failing memories were unequal to the task of recalling the lines of the duets.
Dane's wife predeceased him about 10 years ago. He leaves a son and daughter and four grand children. Self effacing as he was he lived a full life in accordance with the tenets of his religion and the ethical values and the culture of our motherland devoting time and energy in the service of the many young generations of students here and abroad.
May he rest in peace!

Tribute:
Putting yourself in others' shoes
Seven years ago, I met a professor who delivered a talk on peace and conflict resolution at the University of Kelaniya.
He spoke about 'Empathy' which was not a familiar topic in our day to day conversation. Later on, empathy became a word that we loved the most and used the most. The person who communicates the beauty about empathy with thousands of students in Sri Lanka is Professor Jayantha Senavirathne who is about to retire from his university career.
I met Professor Senavirathne as my teacher, instructor and supervisor at the University of Kelaniya where I studied my first degree on peace and conflict resolution.
What makes Professor Senavirathne a groundbreaking academic on the Sri Lankan peace education arena He is a key member among Sri Lankan academics who work on promoting peace education at a time period that no one spoke out about peace education.
Peace education is educating people for peace. Or in other words, peace education attempts to transform society by creating a peaceful consciousness that condemns violent behaviour. It attempts to transform ways of thinking that have been developed over time.
It questions the structures of violence that dominate everyday life and tries to create a peaceful disposition to counteract the omnipotent values of militarism. Irrespective of political and personal level threats, Professor Senavirathne has been questioning violence in the Sri Lankan society for the past three decades.
He is still questioning and condemning the violent political and social structures. Betty Reardon, one of USA's groundbreaking peace educators, suggests that peace education is . . . [the] transmission of knowledge about the requirements of, the obstacles to and possibilities for achieving and maintaining peace, training in skills for interpreting the knowledge, and the development of reflective and participatory capacities for applying the knowledge to overcoming problems and achieving possibilities.
Professor Senavirathne transformed knowledge and also interpreted knowledge. As a young university student we were brave enough to question our professor and challenge him. But the beautiful thing was he always says "find solutions, always putting yourself in others' shoes".
I still can remember how he emphasises each letter in that sentence. He puts life into the sentence. In holistic definition, peace education is about influencing people to behave more peacefully, or to develop caring and non-aggressive people who relate peacefully to others in their own lives, facilitate the well-being of others, and work to promote peace and prevent violence in society and the world at large.
We travelled together with Professor Senavirathne with the message of peace and ethnic harmony. South to North, North to East and around Sri Lanka. He is not a typical academic who doesn't have ground level experience. He is a practical academic who brings practitioner's skills and academic's knowledge into one hand.
Professor Senavirathne is a groundbreaking peace educator in Sri Lanka. We wish you long life!

Ansar Jabir:
Reminiscing fond memories of our father
It has been a year since your death but time seems to have made no difference to the pain of your absence. Memories of you are still fresh in our minds and continue to be played over and over like a record in perpetual playback.
We revisit that fateful day and wonder what could have been done to change the outcome. We come up with several solutions but alas you're not here anymore and we unwillingly have to succumb to the divine plan every time. We believe in the infinite mercy of the Almighty and pray that you're basking in its shade right now and will be forever.
You taught us countless things about life. To be generous to those less well off, to be upright in our dealings with our fellow human beings, to live within our means and several more things too many to enumerate here.
You proved to us that formal education does not necessarily correlate with intelligence or success. You enabled us to pursue our goals in life and tempered our dreams with a dose of pragmatic realism that only a father and a husband could apply.
You left people with memories of your tact, generosity, business acumen and your down to earth attitude. You mixed with people at every level of society from presidents, diplomats and monarchs of nations to those who came home yearly to ask for some sort of monetary aid.
What made you stand out was your acumen as an expert gem merchant. This expertise lead you to the unique distinction of being the one to provide the beautiful blue sapphire in Princess Diana's engagement ring which Kate Middleton now wear's.
It makes us immensely proud to be your sons when people mention these traits of yours and inspires us to be sons that you would have been proud of.
Despite the difficulties entrusted on us by your absence. We try to be thankful to the Almighty. Your passing away is part of His divine plan and apt lesson for us all.
It has most importantly taught us not to take for granted the loved ones in our lives and to be thankful to them as their loss can never be replaced.
May Almighty Allah grant him Jennathul!

Distortion, thy name is creativity

Theatre in any country demands an audience. No audience for theatre, or any other art form, indicates a cultural poverty of some sort. Parakrama Niriella, a veteran in local theatre, foresaw this poverty and founded Janakaraliya as a remedy.
Janakaraliya (Peoples Theatre) was formed with a mission to develop a culturally and spiritually awakened society. Structurally a mobile cultural organisation, Janakaraliya uses a collapsible theatre and travels through districts with its theatre group.
It journeys from district to district with a host of activities: organizing drama, theatre training for youth, providing cultural and spiritual experiences and offering the people an opportunity to participate in cultural activities. The Janakaraliya team comprises Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim youth hailing from different parts of the country.
Q: Your pet project is Janakaraliya. Why have you initiated such a project
A: A few decades ago, our artistes worked together without any issue of their ethnicity. That is before the war erupted. With a war going on, artistes were no longer united. We wanted to unite them under one umbrella. Janakaraliya is the result.
The project is also involved with programmes such as mobile theatre and theatre groups. When we work together as one group of people, it will be always for the betterment of the people. Ethnic harmony is a necessity for the art.
We have also launched programmes to introduce theatre for schools.
Q: Drama and Theatre is already a school subject. Isnt it
A: Drama and Theatre is confined to a theoretical subject at the school. How many people are following arts as a subject But how many of them actually get into painting as a profession Same goes for drama and theatre. It has become only a subject. You can study it well, pass the exam and then complete forget it. Students hardly pursue theatre as a professional subject.
Our school syllabi do not move a step ahead from Ediriweera Sarachchandra. We have not started serious studies of his successors.
Q: Drama and Theatre is not a lucrative profession as yet. Probably why.
A: Any aesthetic subject should have a market. A market has to be created. Art, as a whole, is a necessity of life. Just like you go to a doctor for medical treatment, and an engineer for a building construction, an artist should also offer you a service.
We have 24 hours a day. We work for eight hours. And we have the rest of the time for entertainment. Recently my daughter wanted to take our granddaughter somewhere on a night-out. We were looking for a place, and could not come across any sufficient place. You cannot go to Diyatha Park everyday. There is hardly any theatre hall. There is hardly any place to listen to a good music concert. You cannot find good museums. You cannot find good libraries. But there were more than enough eateries. When we have time for entertainment, what we do is eating and hardly anything else.
Q: All the same, Colombos walls are full of posters of upcoming stage plays. Doesnt that mean that we have a good number of theatrical productions
A: I did not mean to say that we are short of stage plays. We have talented young dramatists. But they are not being maintained. Doctors and engineers are looked after by the government. They can operate independently. Even politicians somehow manage to have an independent life at least for five years. But the artistes have no such guarantee.
Giving them a house or another perk or two is not what a government should necessarily do. The Government should allocate a separate budget to sustain artistes. India, for instance, has allocated a certain percentage of their GDP for the artistes. At the same time, stage plays such as Phantom of the Opera and Lion King have been shown for years. Like doctors, engineers and any other government employee, the artists should also be maintained by the government.
The local theatre has about 15,000 spectators. They are the ones who come to theatre throughout the year.
Q: You mentioned that we have not moved ahead from Dr Sarachchandra. However William Shakespeare, a 400-year old playwright, is still celebrated in the west. Why
A: What I mean is that we should not become a slave of Sarachchandra. Shakespeare is interpreted from many angles. Some study his language. Some study his theatre. And they move on from what he has originally written. Hamlet, for instance, has come out with quite a lot of productions. I watched a new version of Merchant of Venice. There the scriptwriter has moulded Shylock into a sympathetic character. Without damaging the text, they have tried to justify why Shylock came to be what he is. Akira Kurasova deconstructed Shakespeares Macbeth in Throne of Blood. He made use of noh tradition.
Q: Would not that be distortion
A: Distortion is a requirement to sustain arts. Most great playwrights distorted ancient texts. In a distorted play, you should be able to see the original as well as the innovated plot.
Q: Buddhist elements seem to have seeped into arts as a recent trend. Whats your view
A: That is largely because of the rekindled racism. The problem with these Buddhist films is that you cannot see much creativity. For example if Prince Siddhartha performs fighting shows, we do not like to see him bleeding. We will get rid of such scenes. And we include all the other miraculous events like walking in the air.
Q: Would not that fall under fantasy category
A: They can fall under fantasy category. But then such films are meant for children and the hare-brained. Adults have nothing to gain from such films. At the same time, there are films which make use of the magic realism concept. Even if fantasy or magic realism elements are shown, you should be able to link them with the reality.
Take a film about a cruel emperor, and you make use of unrealistic scenes to show his cruelty. We know the scenes are unrealistic. We also know that such scenes are meant to enhance the cruelty of the emperor.

Djokovic thrashes Murray for sixth Aussie Open title
World number one Novak Djokovic hammered a misfiring Andy Murray in straight sets to win a record-equalling sixth Australian Open title and strengthen his grip on men's tennis on Sunday.
The Serbian world number one swept to a 6-1, 7-5, 7-6 (7/3) victory in two hours, 53 minutes to hand Murray his fifth defeat in the Melbourne Park final.
Djokovic equalled the tally of Australia's Roy Emerson, who won the tournament six times between 1961 and 1967, an achievement that has gone unmatched in the 49 years since. It was also Djokovic's 11th Grand Slam title, and he moved into equal fifth place with Rod Laver and Bjorn Borg behind 17-time leader Roger Federer.
Djokovic paid tribute to his vanquished rival, telling the crowd at the presentation: "Tough luck tonight Andy, you are a great champion, you're a great friend, a great person.
"He's very professional and committed to this sport, so I am sure in the future he is going to have more opportunities to play for this trophy."
Djokovic underlined his status as the dominant force in Melbourne, after downing Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to win his first major title in 2008 and beating Rafael Nadal in an epic final in 2012, along with his four wins over Murray in 2011, 2013, 2015 and now 2016.
Djokovic also extended his Grand Slam winning streak to 21 matches, and he has not lost a match at the majors since he was defeated by Stan Wawrinka in last year's French Open final at Roland Garros. While Djokovic was further enhancing his reputation, Murray has the unwanted statistic of becoming only the second man in the post-1968 Open Era to lose five Grand Slam finals at any one major. AFP

Ishani breaks another national swimming record

Sri Lanka's top swimmer Ishani Senanayake of Sri Lanka Army and Killer Whale Aquatic Club added another feather to her swimming cap when she broke the national free style record for 800 metres at SAF Games Swimming Trials worked off by the Sri Lanka Aquatic Sports Union (SLASU) at the Sugathadasa Stadium Swimming Complex.
Ishani Senanayake timed 9.55.46 minutes to eclipse the record of 9.56.10 minutes held by National swimmer Machiko Rahim since November 2012. She set up this record at the National Swimming Championship.
Twenty year old Ishani Senanayake is the fastest woman in the waters in the 800 metres free style event and is the proud owner of both the long course and short course national records. She achieved both these during a short period of time which is a true reflection of her improvement of both speed and skills in this water sport.
By merit alone she has been selected for the SAF Games swimming squad for the SAF Games to be held in New Delhi. She will be competing in three events and is presently under the watchful eyes of Manoj Abeysinghe.
The SAF swimming contingent underwent training at the Peradeniya University swimming pool this week to get themselves familiar with various conditions.
The conditions at New Delhi is expected to be colder than Colombo hence this acclimatisation at Peradeniya.
This is a good move by the swimming authorities as acclimatisation plays an important role.
Ishani Senanayake has many swimming records to her credit at various meets and was adjudged the champion swimmer at the recently concluded National Sports Festival where she established two meet records.

## Title: MILITARY ETIQUETTE!
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Monday, February 1, 2016 - 01:00
MILITARY ETIQUETTE!

The military services have a long history in which many traditions have become an established norm. These traditions can be broken down into various customs and courtesies. A custom is a way of acting in a manner that has continued consistently over such a long period that it has become a sort of unwritten law. And it becomes a usual way of acting in given circumstances. It is a practice so long established that it has the force of law.
A courtesy is a form of polite behaviour and excellence of manners. You will note that military life gives rise to many situations, not found in civilian life, that require special behaviour. Customs and courtesies that help make life orderly and are a way of showing respect.
These old customs are regular, expected actions. They have been constant sources of disciplined and civilised behaviour and passed from one generation to the next. The exercise of customs, courtesies, and ceremonies helps keep discipline and order in a military organisation.
The keywords in military etiquette are discipline and honourable conduct, the hallmarks of an officer and gentleman. Every officer is expected to conduct him/herself in the highest ethical manner in all relationships with peers, superiors, and subordinates. Such upright behaviour is expected of them both in and out of uniform.
Courage is another watchword in the armed services lexicon. In acknowledging their commitment to courage, they accept that courage is the value that gives them the moral and mental strength to do what is right, even in the face of personal or professional hardship.
Their commitment to these core values acknowledges that they will obey orders, while demanding respect up and down the chain of command. As services personnel all military men and women are supposed to be proud professionals.
It is their duty to always work as a team. But they cannot achieve this type of professionalism without maintaining a mutual level of respect for one another. Their job will be made that much easier if they observe the principles of military etiquette and courtesy.
The day-to-day duty of every soldier, sailor and airman and woman is to work together as a team to improve the quality of their work, their co-workers and themselves.
Saluting is very much a part and parcel of military a tradition and a rule. It is perhaps one of the oldest signs of respect leading back to the Romans whom all armies and navies adopted this practice from. All officers largely regard the salute as a very basic measure of a person's level of professionalism and sense of respect toward a Commissioned Officer/Warrant Officer.
It is indeed a required act of military courtesy. Regulations governing its use are founded on military custom deeply rooted in tradition. The salute is a symbol of respect and a sign of comradeship among all services personnel. The salute is simple and dignified but there is great significance in that gesture. It is a time-honoured demonstration of courtesy among all military personnel that expresses mutual respect and pride in the service.
All military personnel are advised to never resent or try to avoid saluting persons entitled to receive the salute. The most common form of salute is the hand salute. However, there are other types, such as gun and rifle salutes.
Every officer is expected to obey certain unwritten laws. There are no regulations or written instructions to assist the newly commissioned officer in most of these matters. If an officer seeks guidance from those in authority he will usually receive the unsatisfactory reply that this is "done" or "not done" because it is the "Custom of the Service."
A newly enlisted officer is liable to make many unfortunate mistakes before he/she learns from experience the numerous un-written customs he is expected to comply with.
Lectures will undoubtedly be given in these subjects at the beginning of their training, but there is so much to learn in the early days and so much to interest them, that it is not to be wondered at if the importance of this aspect of their training is not realised by the majority until it is too late.
It would be best for everyone to remember that in the armed forces, the various grades of colonels, generals, and admirals are addressed simply as Colonel, General, or Admiral. Their surnames can be added, but during a drawn out conversation the title alone is the simpler accepted choice. In the Army and Air Force, non-commissioned officers are also addressed officially by their titles, although they may also use "Mr." or "Ms." socially. Warrant officers are called "Mr." or "Ms." both officially and socially.
Naval officers who rank from lieutenant commander up are called 'Commander.' Officers below that rank are called 'Mr.' in conversation but when introduced are referred to by their titles.
But the immediate responsibility for the care and preparation of men for battle rests on the shoulders of the junior commander - a responsibility that he must take control of eagerly and tackle firmly in the knowledge that the officer who measures up to his job has no more loyal supporters than his own men.
The future of the Armed Forces lies with its officers, and, in particular, with its junior officers. It is their contribution that will determine the morale and fighting spirit of the troops in battle.
The junior officer should also remember that his personal bearing will exercise a dominating and permeating influence not only with his own men but with the general public and that the tone of an army is set by its officers.
In public, therefore, as on parade, he must conduct himself in such a fashion that the uniform he wears is regarded by the general public less as a uniform than as the hallmark of that great profession of arms to which he belongs - a profession whose prestige in time of war is vitally bound up with a nation's destiny. Such admirable and exemplary behaviour would obviously prompt a snappy salute from an admiring public.

New vistas at Vista Lite

Man's imagination knows no bounds. Millions of films have gripped the world with its creativity and it keeps on growing. It creates change and it creates a thought revolution. It has transformed the lives of so many through fiction and non -fiction. Every year thousands of films come out in almost every region of the world. It is one of humanity's greatest achievements. Great minds like Stan Lee have created their own brand of films, like Stan Lee's hugely successful marvel comics. People are crazy about marvel comic movies because they bring excitement. The Daily News visited Ja-Ela to check out the hype generated with the opening of Vista Lite.
"I believe the opening of a cinema is a worthwhile effort. From what I can remember in 2014, five cinema halls mushroomed. However, last year, only one cinema hall opened. We have great expectations this year because this being the month of January, we have already opened up Vista Lite. New cinema halls entering the cinema system in Sri Lanka is important to the industry. One factor that has to be taken into consideration is the quality of the cinema hall. That is of vital importance," said Secretary Exhibitors Association, Nishantha Pradeep Mohittige.
"Here we are using state-of-the-art technology. Vista Lite is equipped with the latest 4K digital projection systems coupled with 7.1 digital surround sounds and 'eye popping' 3D to give our patrons the ultimate movie going experience," Mohittige added.
Movie Works is an entertainment based company involved in building and operating state-of-the-art luxury mini cinemas. The Cinemas are Liberty Lite (Colombo 3), Amity Lite (Maharagama), Sky Lite (Matara) and the latest addition is Vista Lite at K Zone Ja-Ela.
Managing Director Anura JasenthuliyanageDirector Technology Palitha Perera

The brains behind the company are the duo Palitha Perera - Director Technology and Anura Jasenthuliyana - Managing Director.
"These two sometimes work night and day to bring quality to the cinema industry. Their contribution to the enjoyment of their patrons is commendable. So they have brought all of this forward. Their companionship has been the pillars of movie works. So we must strengthen our effort to provide quality entertainment to patrons of this country and for this we appeal to the media. This is also for those who are in the industry right now and for future generations," Perera said.
Vista Lite was originally intended as a shopping space with K-Zone being a shopping complex but the open space was later converted to the cinema.
"After much deliberation, we were able to build this cinema which is comfortable and fulfills all expectations. So this cinema hall has 200 seats. We want the patrons to have an 'out of this world' experience with the best technology and draw audiences from Ja-Ela," said Perera.
The ceremonial opening of the Vista Lite 3D Cinema was held on January 22 with the screening of the Star Wars in 3D.
"We intend to offer the magical creations of Hollywood and Bollywood at a very reasonable rate of Rs. 300 along with the worldwide release in a luxurious and true cinematic environment. The ticket purchase is facilitated via online with www.tickets.lk. Vista Lite project partners are John Keells Holdings. Their initiative is to include a modern cinema in one of the most sought after shopping malls in Sri Lanka," said Jasenthuliyana.
K- Zone Ja-Ela is a modern day shopper's dream which has been modeled on the image of Wal- Mart Stores in America. It has a food court, Gymnasium, banks and supermarket.
"Vista Lite wants to go to the crowds in Ja-Ela and get them on board so they can experience some quality stuff. The screen we are using must be specially mentioned because it is one of the best. It is a new screen type," pointed out Perera.
It has been seven years since the day when Anura Jasenthuliyana and Palitha Perera started their endeavour.
"It has been a long journey. Liberty Lite, Kollupitiya was our 'first born'. We have been friends for a long time as schoolmates and boarders for almost 10 years. Our passion was film. We would watch as many films as possible. Once we were caught by our warden when we were watching a film in the hall! We had a close relationship with cinema even though at that time we had no understanding of the technology used. Even today in the world the number one entertainment are movies. This will never leave or become outdated. It is forever. So this endeavor of ours is a labour of love. So we have been able to do all of this because of that chemistry. We also believed in ourselves and in each other. So it has been an eventful journey starting from Liberty Lite. So this gives me genuine pleasure to see all of you here to view this cinema before its opening. So now it is finally complete and has come to fruition. And I am very satisfied about this," said Jasenthuliyana.
Jasenthuliyana emphasized that we must keep up with the development of cinema all over the world. This includes technology and latest releases.
"So we want to capture the essence of Hollywood and Bollywood. Our plan is to release the films in Sri Lanka as soon as they have been released in other parts of the world. So we want to give this opportunity to our filmgoers."

Holy Cross 1953/54 classmates celebrate 60th anniversary
The 1953/54 group of classmates of Holy Cross College, Kalutara, celebrated their 60th anniversary with a get-together at Panorama Hotel, Kalutara recently.
The Chief Guest was LLRC member and Missing Persons Commission head Maxwell Paranagama who is an old boy of Holy Cross College, Kalutara.
Holy Cross College, Kalutara Rector Rev. Fr. Carlton de Silva and Vice Rector Rev. Fr. Chrisantha Kumara also graced the occasion.
The meeting commenced with the singing of the college anthem and the observance of two minutes silence in remembrance of the departed classmates.
The Chief Guest was welcomed by Dr. Lucian Jayasuriya who garlanded him. In his address, Dr. Jayasuriya thanked the Chief Guest and his wife for accepting the invitation and attending the function.
He also thanked the organisers for keeping in touch with all classmates and organising these get-togethers continuously for six decades. He also noted the dwindling numbers in later years, - particularly Deshabandu Dr. Reggie Seimon, Rex de Silva and Evans Cooray who passed away last year - as all classmates are now Octogenarians or thereabouts.
The Chief Guest recalled his days spent at Holy Cross College along with his brothers.
Rev. Fr. de Silva said he was delighted to be in a group where classmates meet annually. He also said that he has never come across such a meeting of zealous classmates holding meetings continuously for such a long period.
Subsequently, singing of Christmas Carols and songs of yore were presented by the Group with music provided by an organist and a guitarist.
The Vote of Thanks was delivered by the chief organiser Percy de Silva. He also mentioned the past teachers who moulded the group for what they are today and mentioned that among the group are eminent doctors, lawyers, engineers, journalists, Members of Parliament, and even a Professor and a High Court Judge who all performed a yeoman service to the country during their hay days and brought honour to their Alma Mater!
The meeting culminated with lunch and all the members of the Group vowed to meet next year as well.

Return of the Dictator

[The cast]
Ralahamy
Wijerathne WarakagodaHamine- Malini Weeramuni Mahaththaya Daya TennekoonStella - Pinnya SamarathungaGalpotha- Prabhath DhevidraNella - Purnima Pilapitiya and Kiruthika ThurairajahHirithala Kolla - Pradeep Kumara Production TeamDirector - Namel WeeramuniCostumes - Senaka de SilvaMake up -Buddhi GalappaththiSet - Lal HarendranathMusic - Jayathissa AlahakoonLighting - Prabath Manohara
It is official. The Dictator is back. Yes, the imaginative re-working of H.C.N. De Lanerolle's play called The Dictator, which was staged at the Punchi Theatre last year, directed by the creative genius that is Namel Weeramuni, is back on the boards, this time at the venue it was originally staged way back in the 1950s, at the Lionel Wendt, on February 7, 2016.
For those of you who missed the previous performances of this hilarious yet poignant classic, here is the chance to see Malini Weeramuni as Hamine epitomizing the role of the dominant wife, and threatening to bring the house-down as she henpecks her husband the Dictator, himself. She gets brilliant outstanding support from Daya Tennakoon as Mahattaya and Pinnya Samarathunga as Stella. The supporting caste comprising thin, bespectacled, Galpotha (Prabhath Dhevindra) the reporter from the Daily News and Nella (Purnima Pilapitiya/Kiruthika Thurairajah) the no-nonsense woman of steel from the Times of Ceylon also render brilliant caricatures of those in the print-media while Pradeep Kumara who makes brief appearances as the exorcist is bound to give you a few goose-bumps regardless of whether you are a believer or a non-believer of the occult sciences.
Undoubtedly, Wijeratne Warakagoda, as Dictator, holds centre stage. From the first moment he steps onto the stage to the last scene when he stamps his foot and proclaims from now on he will be the Dictator in his home, one cannot fail to admire the ceaseless energy of this veteran actor and the skilled performance he delivers. Just to watch his face, crossing from bafflement to wide-eyed pleasure at how he manages to defeat the enemy through huniyum and anjanam eli is priceless.
In a way The Dictator is a timeless tale about the dominance of the wife over the husband.
Even Haminey obeyed me! exclaims Ralahamy in wide eyed wonder as he recollects his dream. Even though he hopes to hold the reigns of his household from now on, it is highly unlikely he will succeed.
The strict look on Hamine's face with the corners of her mouth turned down indicating she will stand no such nonsense, says it all. In other words, no married man can ever have the power of a dictator at home. We think we can, but we can't, laughs Director Namel Weeramuni.
The set expertly designed by Lal Harendranath, the costumes by Senaka de Silva, make-up by Buddhi Galappaththi and music by Jayathissa Alahakoon culminate in bringing a bygone era back to life.
Here is a production that guarantees to give you one of the most enjoyable evenings spent at the Lionel Wendt in recent times.
The combination of a historically intriguing story, a heartily funny script and truly remarkable performances results in making The Dictator, one of the must see plays of 2016. (One warning though: by the time the play ends you might end up having a few permanent laugh lines on your face, but believe me, it's worth it.)
Be sure not to miss this hilarious theatrical masterpiece on 7th February at the Lionel Wendt at 7pm.

[SINGER CRICKET CORNER]
Come back win over Afghans ensures Lankans quarter final spotICC UNDER 19 WORLD CUP NEWS:
Sri Lanka U19s after a great game of cricket since they arrived in Bangladesh booked a place in the quarterfinals of ICC U19 World Cup 2016 winning both matches they played so far in the first round against Canada Under 19s and Afghanistan Under 19s with a game to play on Wednesday against their Pakistan counterparts. The results of Wednesday's match will decide as to who would clinch the top spot in Group B as both teams, Sri Lanka and Pakistan have already qualified to play in quarters.
Lankan youth's morale was very high as they won both warm-up games comprehensively. The roles of skipper Charith Asalanka and his deputy Shammu Ashan in the four games they played so far were admirable that they led their team from the front in all their victories.
After Lankan youths handed Canada an enormous 196-run thrashing in their first group-game, they had a tough time against Afghans in the second outing as their batters except Charith who made a gallant 71 failed to post a challenging total after batting first. Afghans chasing a modest target of 185 to win were in a somewhat comfortable position when they reached 74 for four halfway through their innings, but panic set in as Lankan bowlers ripped the heart out of the Afghans batting claiming their last six wickets for just 77 runs to win the match by 33 runs.

After Royal made 348 for seven with the help of Thiran's century, Lasith Embuldeniya and Charuka Hatharasinghe sharing 7 wickets between them made Maris Stella bat again as the Negombo School managed only 213 in reply.

Thurstan College raced to the top position in Group B pushing table leaders St.Josephs to third slot after they beat Zahira by 10 wickets. Thurstan's first innings score of 262 in reply to the Zahira's 126 gave them a healthy first innings lead of 136.
Zahira in their second innings needed to bat well if they were to save the game and in the end they somehow managed to avert the innings defeat but Naveen Gunawardana capturing six wickets did not allow Zahira to build up a sufficient overall lead that could force a draw. Thurstan needing just 42 to win were home in just under five overs to win the match by 10 wickets.

Kaveen Bandara who took a match-bag of 10 wickets was instrumental in Maliyadeva's marginal first innings win. St.Aloysius chasing 211 to win forced a draw in the end after they had made 143 for six in their second innings before close on the final day.
Maliyadeva : 193 in 54.1 overs (Damith Perera 80, Dilshan Kollure 41, Hareen Buddila 3/50) and 191 in 72.3 overs (Dulaj Ranathunga 50, Damith Perera 30, Hareen Buddila 5/97, Navindu Nirmal 2/17)

Somewhere, over the rainbow...

There is a saying that the greater your storm, the brighter your rainbow. This seems to be the idea that director Priyantha Colombage has tried to capture in his latest cinematic voyage, 'Dedunu Aakase'. The team held the 'muhurath' ceremony of the movie recently at Galadari Hotel, Colombo.
A Swarnavahini production, 'Dedunu Aakase' stars upcoming actor Hemal Ranasinghe in the lead role. Two new faces to the screen will join him as his leading ladies: Chulakshi Ranatunga and Shanel Fernando. Chulakshi is Miss World Sri Lanka 2014 while Shanel is a seasoned model.
The movie rotates round the lives of Samudra, Vihangi and Pavani. Both Samudra and Vihangi are two youths who are well versed in dancing. They complete their education and train to take part in a dance competition. But Vihangi becomes injured in the process and has to bid adieu to dancing for a few months.
Enter Pavani. Vihangi sees that Pavani has a flair for dancing and tries to link her up with Samudra so that the two can take part in the competition. But Samudra is against the idea at first. Vihangi somehow manages to convince him that this is the best step to take at the moment. So Pavani and Samudra start to practice the dance items together.
Vihangi is in love with Samudra but Samudra only sees her as a friend. He also knows that his family will never welcome her to their home as his future partner. As time passes Samudra and Pavani form a relationship. Vihangi is detached from their life. But after eight long years the three meet again. This meeting changes their lives forever. This triangular romance is what is brought onto the wide screen through 'Dedunu Aakase'. Director Colombage along with Tharaka Herath Dhamunumulla has written the script. Ranga S Bandara who has worked with Colombage in the advertising sector will be handing the camera for the movie.
Megha Kavinda Colombage and Diran Wijesinghe are the editors of the project. Chitral Somapala will be handing the music while Upul Shantha Sannasgala, Nandana Wickramage, Vajira Mahakanumulla and Priyantha Colombage had penned the lyrics of the songs in the movie. The assistant director is Donald Jayantha. The art director is Mangala Fernando. Nalin Prematileke will be handling the makeup department while Udeni Alwis and Megha Kavinda Colombage are in charge of the still photographs. The colour grading too is by Megha Kavinda Colombage. Janaka Ullandupitiya designed the costumes. The line production is by Palitha Tennakoon and Ruvin Maladeniya. The recording and graphics are by Diran Wijeyasinghe.
Apart from the lead actors, Jayalath Manoratne, Saheli Sadithma, Srimal Wedisinghe and Madhini Malwatte too will be acting in the film.

What you need to know

Dr. Chrishan Jude Jayamaha (M.B., B.S. PG Dip in Med. Micro., M.D. (Med. Virology), a Consultant Virologist attached to the Department of Virology, Medical Research Institute (MRI) speaks about Zika virus infection, the latest disease reported from many Western countries in the world affecting many people, especially pregnant women and newborns.
Q  Zika virus is the current health issue in many countries. Why are we so concerned about it 
A - The concern about this infection is mainly due to the relationship between Zika virus infections during pregnancy and observed increase in congenital (birth defects) malformations of the central nervous system among newborns (especially microcephaly- small head).
Dr. Chrishan Jude Jayamaha (M.B., B.S. PG Dip in Med. Micro., M.D. (Med. Virology), a Consultant Virologist attached to the Department of Virology, Medical Research Institute (MRI).

Q  How does the virus spread 
A - Through mosquito bites. Zika virus is transmitted to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. These are the same mosquitoes that spread Dengue and Chikungunya.
Q  What are the symptoms of Zika virus infection 
A - About one in five people infected with Zika virus become ill (develop Zika).The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis (red eyes). Other common symptoms include muscle pain and headache. The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting for several days to a week. The incubation period (the time from exposure to symptoms) for Zika virus disease is not known, but is likely to be a few days to a week.
Q  How long will the disease last and how do doctors diagnose it 
A - Zika virus usually remains in the blood of an infected person for a few days, but it can be found longer in some people. Severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon. Deaths are rare. The symptoms of Zika are similar to those of Dengue and Chikungunya.
Zika can be laboratory diagnosed by antibody developed against Zika virus, but cross reaction with Dengue and Chikungunya viruses can occur. Polymerase chain reaction PCR can be also used in early periods of the infection to confirm diagnosis.
Q  What are the treatments available at the moment
A - No vaccine or medications are available to prevent or treat Zika infections. Doctors treat the symptoms. Affected patients need to get plenty of rest and drink fluids to prevent dehydration. They need to take paracetamol to relieve fever and pain.

Wish Upon a Butterfly

Ever wondered how you could tell someone in the best way possible about the magnificent, ethereal feeling that is bubbling in your heart which can be summed up into one simple word - love! Wonder no more. Go out into your garden, pack your love with care and send it to your beloved - on the wings of a butterfly.
If you can find one, though. For, scientists say butterflies are in grave danger of disappearing from planet earth if we do not take the necessary steps to give them the habitat they need to survive.
Imagine a world without butterflies. They are surely the epitome of natural beauty, their wings probably sprinkled with rainbow dust are the place where love and awe and inspiration meet. Not surprisingly, the ancient Greek name for butterflies was the same as their word for soul - 'psyche'. Yet, this could not have been just a chance association: the adult butterfly is, after all, a creature that transforms from lowly larval 'worm' into one of the most beautiful of all life forms.
The good news is it is quite easy to create a haven for these lovely winged creatures right in your garden. You may even find that you already grow the flowers that attract butterflies. With just a little more effort you could transfer your garden into a magical fairyland when the sun teases open the petals of flowers in the early morning and the butterflies flit from one newly opened flower, to another, whispering sweet secrets...
To get down to earth from these lofty thoughts, when deciding where to locate your butterfly garden, experts say it is best to choose a spot that is not isolated from other plants. Butterflies will be more likely to find your garden if there are other flowers nearby to lead them to your mini paradise. But if your butterfly garden is the only patch of flowers in a vast sea of grass, butterflies won't have much reason to be in the area. If you have a border of flowering shrubs and other butterfly-enticing plants are scattered around your yard, the butterflies are much more likely to spend time in your garden.
Even though beginning a butterfly garden can be as simple as choosing flowering plants that will invite adult butterflies to your garden to feed, if you want to create a garden that will act as a sanctuary, attracting a wide variety of butterflies while also providing a place where butterflies can grow and multiply, you will first need some simple planning. By considering which plants to grow and evaluating your garden site, you can plant a garden that will help with the creation processes of butterflies too.
The hitch here is, even though many flowering plants will attract butterflies to your location, not all flowers look attractive to the eyes of a butterfly. Still, selecting plants that will feed butterflies while also encouraging them to stick around for a while, laying eggs and creating a new generation of butterflies, can easily be done. To do this, you will need to choose plants that fall into two groups: nectar plants that will provide adult butterflies with energy and caterpillar food plants that will feed caterpillars. With careful selection from these two groups, your garden will provide for the entire life cycle of butterflies.
As most lepidopterists say, the relationship, however, between butterflies, caterpillars and the plants they use for food is not a casual one. It is a relationship created over thousands of years as flowering plants developed alongside insects. As a result of this long development, caterpillars will use only certain plants for food. At the same time, butterflies are equally picky about what plants they will select to lay their eggs on. In order to encourage caterpillars in the garden, butterfly gardeners need only select the plants that are preferred by caterpillars in their location. Nature and chemistry will take care of the rest.
According to Douglas B Ranasinghe, Former President, Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka, "To establish butterfly gardens you should have a few Host plants, Nectar plants and land space. At the inception, it is recommended to plant 'Adana Hiriya' 'Wara' 'Aththora' 'Akkapana'',Kiri Aguna wel', as Host plants and 'Balunakuta', Shoe flower, Trdex, Zeeniyas, Ixora as Nectar Plants. A used earthen curd milk pot with mud, sunk to floor level and a container to hold some ripe fruits will be sufficient for a small garden."
Other plants you could grow to attract butterflies include Dehi , Bowitiya, Edaru, Kahabiliya, Mussenda, Eraminiya, as well as trees like guava, Ugurassa, Siyabala, mango, Karapincha and Kathurumurunga.
In addition to providing food for butterflies, your butterfly garden should also provide a resting place for your visitors. Include flat rocks in your garden where the butterflies can sun themselves. It is even better if the rocks have shallow depressions where water will puddle and provide a place for butterflies to gather for a drink.
Another important point to remember is not to use insecticides in your garden. Believe it or not, having many insects in your garden, is a good thing. About 97 percent of the insect world is beneficial to your garden. The good guys usually take care of the bad guys if you give them a chance, and don't just eradicate them because they are ugly. Always remember when you see a scary bug, it is not necessary to kill him. He may be a good guy who could get rid of a lot of bad guys!
Finally, when your garden is in order, remember to install a comfortable bench placed where you can sit and admire your beautiful surreal guests.
That's it for this week.
Let me leave you with this Irish Blessing. "May the wings of the butterfly kiss the sun/And find your shoulder to light on. To bring you luck, happiness and riches. Today, tomorrow and beyond."
