Lady luck Anushka Sharma taught me how to be more patient, reveals Virat Kohli
Virat Kohli said that it was none other than pacer Zaheer Khan who gave him valuable advice and told him to talk freely about his relationship with Anushka Sharma.
Indian skipper Virat Kohli has credited Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma for making him more sensible and patient in life. In a candid chat on a talk show, Kohli revealed that it was Anushka who brought composure and grace in his life and helped him sail through the tough periods in his cricketing career.
I must thank the lady luck. You have seen me, you know I had no sense before. Ever since the lady has come into my life, shes taught me a lot of things. Ive learnt a lot, become more sensible in the last 4 years all because of her. Shes taught me how to be more patient and taught me how to utilise the position you are into the fullest.
Stating that Anushka had always stood by him, especially during and after his poor run of form in England, the Delhi lad went on to say that she kept him motivated constantly and inspired him to strive harder everyday.
I have never tried to be someone else. But the flip has been because of her. In England in 2014, Anushka was there in my life, she understood what I was going through so she kept me motivated. Her support helped me push through, however bad it was for me. She was a constant in that time. Then Australia happened and I ended up scoring runs, in her presence. So it was a special thing for both of us because she had also faced so much flak. We were being criticised and people were saying this is what happens when you allow girlfriends on the tour., the 28-year-old said.
When asked what made him finally come out and speak about his relationship in the open Kohli revealed that it was none other than pacer Zaheer Khan who gave him valuable advice and told him to talk freely about it.
A very big reason behind me not hiding my relationship is Zaheer Khan. Luckily he was one of the first guys I spoke to about this and he said whatever you do dont try to hide it because youll stress yourself. And on top of that, youre in a relationship, youre not doing anything wrong.
Im actually very grateful that my first interaction about this was with Zak. And he told me the right thing to do so Ive followed it ever since, Kohli concluded.

31,000 MT of petrol arrives
A chemical vessel transporting 31,000 Metric Tons of 92 percent Octane petroleum procured by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) as an emergency measure to cushion off the effects of a fuel shortage, arrived in the island last night.
Officials from the CPC told the Daily News that this shipment was enough to cater to the demand which has doubled in the last four days due to a shortage in the market. However, speaking to the Daily News, the CPC Common Workers Union alleged that this was merely a short fix for a long term problem.
We have never had buffer stocks. Weve been importing and procuring as and when the stocks run out. We need to break free of this cycle and ensure that we maintain enough stocks, said D. G. Rajakaruna, Secretary to the CPC Common Workers Union.
Our primary problem is the lack of storage facility for which weve tabled necessary proposals and agreements. Weve asked that the government make use of the Trincomalee Oil Farm.
Rajakaruna said despite the fact that there is a Cabinet paper on the matter, the issue has been on hold for far too long. We recently protested, demanding the government to make use of these oil tanks, which has sufficient storage. At present, even the LIOC is not making use of all the tanks. Theres no reason why it cannot be shared.

## Title: AFTERMATH OF GEETHAS VERDICT
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, November 9, 2017 - 01:00
AFTERMATH OF GEETHAS VERDICT
The Supreme Court verdict, declaring that Galle district Member of Parliament Geetha Kumarasinghe was ineligible to sit in the legislature because she was a citizen of Switzerland through marriage at the time of the last general election, has caused serious concerns in the corridors of power, particularly in the Joint Opposition (JO) faction of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA).
Kumarasinghe is better known for her charisma and glamour as an actress and starred in many award winning movies including Karumakkarayo and Paalama Yata. As a politician, she did make waves among her own party colleagues in the Galle district but her hallmark had been her undisputed loyalty to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, even after he was defeated at the presidential election.
Now, Kumarasinghe finds herself ousted from Parliament on a legal technicality following a long drawn out legal battle. There has even been speculation that she may be called upon to reimburse the emoluments she received while she served as a MP.
Geetha Kumarasinghe has had a relatively short but eventful political career. In 2010, after Rajapaksa had consolidated himself in power following his victory at the presidential elections in January, he invited many celebrities to run for Parliament. Among them were Kumarasinghe, the undisputed queen of the Sinhala screen, Malani Fonseka (who was accommodated on the National List) and cricketer Sanath Jayasuriya.
Southern Provincialcouncil elections
Fonseka was appointed from the National List and Jayasuriya entered Parliament from the Matara district but Kumarasinghe was unsuccessful, not having sufficient preference votes in the competitive Galle district, despite her celebrity status. Nevertheless, she persevered as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) organiser for Bentara-Elpitiya and contested the Southern Provincial Council elections in 2014, winning a seat in the Council.
Kumarasinghe ran for parliament again in 2015 and was placed fifth in the preferences list with 63,955 votes. Kumarasinghe was elected to Parliament as the UPFA had secured six seats in the Galle district. Chandima Weerakkody, Ramesh Pathirana, Nishantha Muthuhettigama and Manusha Nanayakkara secured more preference votes than Kumarasinghe while former minister Piyasena Gamage missed out, being placed seventh on the list.
It was known at the time of the election that Kumarasinghe was a Swiss citizen by virtue of her marriage to Chris Fuhrer Ferdinand. She dismissed these concerns at the time, saying she had written to the Swiss Embassy renouncing her citizenship.
The bar on dual citizens holding office came into effect only after the National Unity government enacted the 19th Amendment, following the election of President Maithripala Sirisena. Ironically, the UPFA also voted for this amendment. Under this amendment, Article 91(1) (d) (xiii) stipulates that No person shall be qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament or to sit and vote in Parliamentif he (or she) is a citizen of Sri Lanka who is also a citizen of any other country.
Following Kumarasinghes election, the issue received wide publicity and her election was challenged in the Court of Appeal in March 2015 by five voters of the Galle district. In public, when the question was put to her, Kumarasinghe maintained that she would eventually be vindicated by the courts of law. That was not to be. On May 3, 2017, the Court of Appeal held that Kumarasinghes election was unlawful.
Kumarasinghe promptly appealed the decision and on May 12, 2017, the Supreme Court issued a stay order on the Court of Appeal decision until the appeal to the Supreme Court was heard. This is what concluded last week. The verdict of the five judge bench of the Supreme Court, comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justices B.P. Aluvihare, Sisira J. De Abrew, Anil Gooneratne and Nalin Perera was unanimous.
The judgment was read in court by Justice Abrew. When I consider the Article 91(1) (d) (xiii) of the Constitution, I hold that if a candidate in a Parliament Election is a citizen of Sri Lanka and any other country on the day of the parliamentary election or on the day of taking oaths as a Member of Parliament, he or she cannot be considered as an MP and that office of such a person as an MP is a nullity, Justice Abrew observed. After taking oaths as a MP, if he or she becomes a citizen of any other country or continues to be a citizen of any other country, he or she too cannot be considered as an MP and that office of such a person as a Member of Parliament is nullity, Justice Abrew added.
Kumarasinghesdisqualification
On Tuesday, Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas office announced that it had formally received the Supreme Court verdict and that this would be communicated to the Elections Commission shortly. The Elections Commission is likely to call upon Piyasena Gamage, who is next on the list of UPFA preference votes in the Galle district, to fill the vacancy created by Kumarasinghes disqualification. Gamage is as much a loyalist of President Maithripala Sirisena as Kumarasinghe is of Mahinda Rajapaksa. He is likely to be entrusted with a ministerial portfolio as well.
There was some discussion in political circles as to whether the entire UPFA list of parliamentarians would be disqualified. This followed the disqualification of the entire United National Party (UNP) list for the Colombo Municipal Council election in 2006, following the inclusion of a candidate who was under 18 years of age in the list. This led to the farcical situation of an Independent group winning the election and Uvais Mohamed Imitiyas, a 22-year-old trishaw driver becoming the Mayor of Colombo.
However, most legal experts feel that Kumarasinghes disqualification does not fall within the ambit of the grounds enumerated in Section 19(1) of the Parliamentary Elections Act which sets out the instances where nominations can be rejected. Still, this is a matter of interpretation of the law and interested litigants could yet canvass this argument in courts which would of course, leading to another lengthy legal wrangle.
If the entire UPFA list were to be ruled ineligible, the UNP stands to gain about four more parliamentary seats in the Galle district and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna too could gain a seat. In any event, the UNP is unlikely to pursue such an option which would create bad blood between the partners in the National Unity government.
Interestingly, Kumarasinghes disqualification has greater ramifications than the fallout for the movie star turned politician. That is because two leading figures in the JO, the Rajapaksa brothers, Gotabhaya and Basil, are also dual citizens holding citizenship in the United States of America. In fact, the JO faction had been complaining about the dual citizenship clause in the 19th Amendment, claiming that it had been enacted to specifically exclude them from the Sri Lankan political arena.
In the aftermath of Mahinda Rajapaksas defeat in January 2015, both Basil Rajapaksa and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, after an initial period away from the limelight have returned to the forefront. Basil Rajapaksa is the mastermind behind the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) - or the pohottuwa party as it is popularly known- that is expected to field JO candidates at forthcoming elections and be the next political vehicle for the Rajapaksas.
Presidentialcandidacy in 2020
Since the 19th Amendment also debars a person from holding the office of Executive President more than twice and effectively bars Mahinda Rajapaksa from running for President again, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is increasingly being projected as the JOs next presidential candidate, although how the next President is elected is still unclear in the wake of proposed constitutional reforms.
Nevertheless, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, with his track record as the Defence Secretary who successfully prosecuted the war against terrorism, is an integral part of the JOs future plans.
He has launched an organisation of professionals- Viyath Maga- and this has given rise to speculation that he is preparing himself for a presidential candidacy in 2020.
With the verdict on Kumarasinghe now delivered, the JOs roles for these two Rajapaksas are in jeopardy. Basil Rajapaksa has stated publicly that he would not renounce his United States citizenship. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa did state in 2015 that he had applied to renounce his US citizenship but when asked earlier this year, he was non-committal about the issue.
How the JO deals with this conundrum is eagerly being observed by the mainstream SLFP because the verdict on Kumarasinghe could mean that the top triumvirate of the JO- Mahinda, Gotabhaya and Basil Rajapaksa- are effectively out of contention for the next major elections and that would mean a big blow to the dissidents who rely on the Rajapaksa brand name for their success.

Alls well that ends well
At the time of writing this piece, the much anticipated shipment, that will defuse the large scale crisis, caused by the countrywide petrol shortage, was set to arrive in the country. Hopefully, the shipment would have arrived on scheduled, last evening and the distribution process commenced without any undue delay, putting an end to the grave hardships endured by motorists, particularly the three wheel operators, whose livelihoods, no doubt, suffered due to the petrol crisis.
Both, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Petroleum Minister Arjuna Ranatunga apologized to the public, for, what was after all, a grave lapse on the part of the government for not anticipating situations of this nature that may be upon us without warning. It is easy to blame the government for not maintaining additional buffer stocks. But, as Minister Ranatunga said, the storage capacity of the CPC did not permit this. Stocks can be maintained only within the confines of the available storage capacity. Hopefully, the government will be wiser for the experience and take measures to ensure there is no repetition. It should devise measures to get the quality of the fuel checked, at the port of origin, instead of waiting until the shipment had already arrived. Government ministers and officials go abroad for flimsy reasons, but no expert is sent to check the quality of fuel until the government is saddled with an unusable shipment.
However, what has to be taken serious note of is how the crisis originated, in the first place. The minister kept on telling the public that there were adequate stocks to meet the demand, until the shipment arrived, and there was no need to panic. But, by then, panic buying had kept on snowballing, triggered by a SMS message, that caused all hell to break loose and a mad scramble for petrol by the motorists, who went onto stockpile, for which they could not be blamed. From where did this SMS originate The minister has already urged the authorities to trace the source of the SMS, to ascertain who was responsible for setting off the alarm. This could also be a trial run, a precursor for other such alarms, mischief makers may be anticipating to set off in the future. Coincidentally, the refinery at the CPC too began to malfunction at the same time while the computer system too was out. Was there a sinister force at work behind the whole affair, to cause panic and chaos in the country and place the government in difficulty
The authorities should lose no time in getting to the bottom of the whole affair. It wont be difficult to trace the source from which the SMS originated, considering that content of text messages that figured in the alleged bond scam, too, were unraveled and placed before the Special Presidential Commission investigating the matter. If not, the government will have to confront similar crises in the future, as well, when a single text message will set off alarm bells, creating chaos and mayhem in the country. With mini elections round the corner, there is a very likely possibility that political forces who are desperate to get back to the saddle are planning similar scenarios. With unlimited financial resources at their disposal, former VIPs, may, well plan attacks on multiple fronts, at one and the same time, to create the maxim damage, so that the collective public wrath will be directed at the government.
At the time of writing, a train strike too had been planned, from midnight yesterday, to coincide with the tailing off of the petrol crisis, and, running concurrent to the death fast commenced by the parents of the Anti-SAITM medical students. The government should be alive to these unfolding events and deal firmly with politically motivated acts of sabotage.
Be that as it may, the Joint Opposition has seized on the patrol crisis to jump on its hobbyhorse of India bashing. JO firebrand Wimal Weerawansa told parliament that, had the government not ceded 20% of the petroleum distribution market to India, the shortage would not have cropped up. In fact LIOC has control of only 16% of the local market, while the CPCs stake is 84%. It is therefore difficult to comprehend how an island-wide petroleum shortage can be blamed on the LIOC, unless it deliberately contaminated its own oil shipment. As Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in the House, since the LIOC came into being in 2003, why did not Mahinda Rajapaksa cancel the deal, when he was President
For a people friendly budget
It is hoped that Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera will unveil a people friendly budget today, that will have something in it, for all. His, no doubt, will be an unenviable task, given the economic ruin and the gigantic debt the country had been placed in, by the former regime. But, known for his unconventional style of politics, Samaraweera, who will be presenting the countrys 71st post independence budget, it is certain, would depart from the beaten track, and, spring some surprises.

Banking stocks, dollar hit by U.S. doubts
Banking stocks dropped and the dollar slipped on Wednesday as doubts over tax cuts and bond market moves hurt profitability and raised questions over the longevity of the current expansion in the United States.
European banking stocks were the worst performing sector as share indexes across the continent opened lower, following a poor session for U.S. banks.
The dollar edged lower against a basket of currencies hurt by a media report that suggested the implementation of a centerpiece corporate tax cut under discussion in U.S. tax reforms plans could be delayed.
Derek Halpenny, head of global markets research at Mitsubishi UFJ in London, said he was dubious over the progress of the tax cuts program being urged by U.S. President Donald Trumps campaign.
The initial phases of discussions within the House (of Representatives) have brought up a lot of divisions and problems . If the story is true that theyre considering a delay of one year to the corporate tax cut, those big differences will need to be sorted, he said. Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Prime Partners, said the doubts over the tax issue reinforce the case for some consolidation in the market, which has been fully priced for good news.

book review: Politics in a different sphere
Title: Mind Politics in Buddhism: Struggle for Power and Peace Author: Professor Ananda Welihena
The term politics can be defined as a struggle for power and peace. This definition was introduction by none other than the American political scientist. Hans Morgenthau, in his work, Polities among Nations: Struggle for Power and Peace.
This concept of politics reveals how nations, or states, are engaged in the pursuit of power and peace. Their principal aim is to seek power, and in effect, achieve peace for progress. Power is also being used in order to wage war and to do evil to nature. Everyone's wish is that power must be used to do service and achieve peace. Acquired power must be retained, expanded and reinforced. The state, or the polity, is eager to become an empowered by using the acquired power.
Religions, in the past and in the present, have waged war and also done service. They have struggled to preserve their position and power. Currently, people are behaving violently in the name of religion. Race is one other factor which has contributed to violent uprisings. Ethnic groups have struggled to defend their specific culture and identity. These three groups, for an example, have the potential to purify and cultivates noble values, and in effect, become empowered in order to be of service to the world.
As states, religion and ethnic groups struggle for power and peace, the human mind equally struggles for power and peace. It is engaged in politics. It is engaged in a political task. Its aim is to be powerful and peaceful, despite many difficulties and problems. Its desire is to proceed from impurity to cultivation of noble values. A state struggles to achieve power and peace by resorting to economic, social and cultural development. A state that has struggled and gained power is called politically developed country. A politically developed state has power, which implies that in is valuable and beautiful. It becomes the cynosure on the people.
How does a mind strive to become powerful and peaceful How does it achieve value and beauty It can become powerful and peaceful by resorting two strategies. They are: 1) Purification and 2) Cultivation, Purification implies that negative values, thoughts and beliefs must be noted and uprooted by using the tool of mindfulness. One has to be liberal and equanimous. Cultivation implies that he purified mind is used as the soil to cultivate. When weeds of negative thoughts and feelings are uprooted, purity arises in the mind. It is not easy to purity the mind and cultivate noble values in the purified mind soil. There are obstacles cultivated. Purity and cultivation are the hidden potentials of the empowered entity. A developed and empowered mind is charged with power, value and beauty. Mind has to struggle hard to gain like the State, religion and race is become developed and empowered. It must struggle to achieve this wish.
It is not facile to uproot weeds of negative thoughts and values and cultivate seeds of noble values. One has to struggle hard. It means that one has to engage in mind politics. This struggle will produce the favourable results of power, value and beauty at the level of the mind.
A farmer concentrates on a piece of land, uproots weeds, removes its stone,s thorns and roots. A mind developer, or mind fornicator purifies and cultivates the mind by uprooting negative thoughts and cultivating positive values. The land becomes .......and contributory the cultivated mind too become cultivate, innovative and contributory. The cultivated mind. Like a cultivated land, can be called empowered. It can be called a work of art.
Mind struggles to become a work of art. This struggle is political, because it has conflicts and difficulties. Lord Buddha is one who was involved in the work of mind struggle or mind politics. He was initially involved in state politics at the royal palace of his father, who was the King of a region in India. He decided to involve in mind politics by choosing a forest life initially. His findings are recorded in the Dhammapada verses.
There are 423 verses in the Dhammapada; they reveal how one can be trained and formed to struggle for power and peace.
Just as an arrow maker straightens an arrow shaft, even so the discerning person straightens his mind, so fickle and unsteady, so difficult to guard and control (Dh. Verse No. 33).
A politician's mission is to purify and cultivate the polity, and in effect, empower it with value and beauty. A mind developer's task is to purify the mind and cultivate it with seeds of noble values.
Both are engaged in the struggle for power and peace. Plato, the Greek philosopher, wrote in his work Republic that kings must be philosophers. And philosopher must be kings. A mind developer's role is to struggle and lead the mind from impurity to purity and from purity to cultivation of noble values. As the state, or the polity, desires to bloom where it is planted with the help of the politicians, the mind too wishes to boom where it is planted, with the assistance, of the human being. Mind politics is about how the mind struggle to achieve and acquire power and peace through a process purification and cultivation, Meditation (Bhavana) is the most popular strategy that the Buddhas had taught his disciple to practice. Wisdom springs from meditation (Dh Verse No. 282).
In this direction, Professor Ananda Welihenas treatise is noteworthy. Professor Welihena is a learnt philosopher. He secured a special BA degree in a Political Science and International Relations from the University of Peradeniya in 1984.
He pursued a Master's degree at the University of Colombo, and joined the academic staff of the Department of Political Science of the University of Peradeniya. This interdisciplinary work is base don the experiences and learning, gained at the University of Peradeniya as a member of the academic staff.
Author writes that mind can be defined as the sixth sense of the human person according to Buddhism. It can be developed and trained, purified and cultivated as the other five senses for the good of oneself and the happiness of the world. This is the good news preached by the Buddha. In the process of evolution, mind's development is indispensable. A polity, too, should be developed by struggling for power and peace.
Mind is in a state of anarchy; it demands law and order, peace and harmony, security and prosperity. Society is in a state of anarchy as well. The Hobbesonian State of Nature prevails, where each man is a wolf to another (home, homine, lupus). The human being and the head of a State must struggle, and gain power and peace.

Budget to unveil many relief measures
Tax relief across several sectors:Commodity tax reduced on a number of consumer items:Revenue targets to be achieved with no burdens on low, middle income earners :
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera will present Budget 2018 in Parliament at 3 p.m. today.
In the macro-economic perspective, the Governments budgetary proposals for next year are aimed at lowering the Budget-deficit, increasing state revenue and easing the debt burden. This years Budget comes ahead of the Local Government polls to be held in January.
The Government has hinted that the Budget will provide more concessions and tax exemptions to Small and Medium Scale Entrepreneurs and many other needy sectors, including exports, agriculture, IT, education and tourism etc. It hopes to achieve its revenue targets without burdening the low and middle income earners.
The special commodity tax on several essential food items were reduced yesterday as part of Budget 2018. The list includes potatoes and big onions reduced by Rs. 39 per kg, Dhal by Rs. 12, dried fish by Rs.50, Coconut Oil and Vegetable Oil by Rs. 25 as at midnight yesterday. The Gazette Notification with regards to the reduction was issued yesterday noon.
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera pointed out that the government will have to endure a cost of Rs.1.5 billion per month on this relief pack.
Minister Samaraweera making this announcement yesterday at the Finance Ministry said Budget 2018 will encourage self sufficiency.
He also said the main focus of Budget 2018 will be on long term development measures, on education, industry, agriculture and Green Economy.
Quoting an ancient Chinese proverb, Minister Samaraweera said the fundamentals of Budget 2018 will be based on the principle Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for lifetime.
He also highlighted the importance of encouraging self sufficiency among the younger generation who will be the future contributors to the countrys economy.
However, there are times that we need to give instant relief measures to the people as well. If we take the unwelcome weather conditions like floods and droughts we had during this year, the economy was badly affected and living costs has increased. Changes in the global economy also impacted drastically on the local economy. So it is important as a government to intervene at a time like this to give people relief as well, Minister Samaraweera said.

Century after the fall of  Capitalism
The victory of the proletarian revolution in Russia in October 1917 was the key historical event of the XX century. Almost all the progressive and right thinking historians believe that it radically changed the entire course of mans destiny and generated a marked development of a new culture in human relations. The Great October Revolution not only laid the foundation stone for the first socialist state, ending mans exploitation, it also inspired people of all countries to fight the York of Capital.
It found its continuation in the deeds of the builders of socialism, in the heroism of anti-fascists, in the defeat of Hitlers Germany and militarist Japan, in the establishment of a new socialist order in Eastern Europe, in the collapse of the colonial system, in the storm over Latin America, in the inspiring Cuban Revolution, in the courage of Che Guevara, Salvador Allende (Chile) and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and todays leap forward achievements in Peoples Republic of China and Revolutionary Vietnam.
In short, it heralded the emancipation of mankind from the York of Capitalism and paving the way for a more democratic and humane way of life, for the suppressed masses all over the world.
February Revolution and October Revolution
It showed in no uncertain terms that there is a way out for the oppressed to attain liberty, equality and fraternity by putting into the dustbin of history, The Horrified System of Booms and Slumps. In short, Capitalism. Even the present President of Russia, V. Putin has called for an honest assessment of the 1917 revolution that occurred in his own country.
These are his own words- We all know what consequences the so-called great upheavals we usually have. Unfortunately, our country had to face many such upheavals in the 20th Century. 2017 will mark the 100th anniversary of the February Revolution and October Revolution. On this occasion, we could once again assess the causes and essence of Russian revolutions. Not only historians, but the entire Russian Society needs an honest, deep assessments of those events.
Agricultural performance of Russia on the eve of the World War I showed the lowest yields in Europe. The peasants who were toiling in the fields used ten million wooden ploughs; 30 % of them had no working animals to draw the plough and had to hire a horse from the neighbouring Kulak at exorbitant rates. Poverty, hunger and disease with a very high rate of infant mortality were the order of the day.
By 1910, around 54% of all Russias industrial workers were employed in factories with 500 workmen or more-the highest percentage in the world of its kind. However, the control of these factories was highly concentrated. Monopoly organisations-either trusts directly owning group of factories, or syndicates marketing their products-controlled over 75% of Russian output, most of the coal and iron are mined, a very large proportion of metal goods such as steel rails, girders, and agricultural machinery, most of the oil and sugar production, and so on.
The speed at which Russian industry developed from the 90s onwards must not, however, hide from us the incredibly backward state of the Russian economy. In spite of all this development, when compared to the proportion of her size, Russias network of railways in 1913 was four times smaller than that of the U.S.A; and twelve times smaller than that of Germany and United Kingdom.
Her output of coal, in proportion to the population, was five times less than that of France, fifteen times less than that of Germany, 26 times less that of the USA and 31 times less than that of Great Britain. Moreover, the lag was increasing at an alarming rate.
The Russian output of iron per head of population was three times less than French in 1900. It was six times less than German output in 1900. Further, it was already eight times less than American output per head in 1900.
Although these figures reveal that there was some industrial development in Russia during this period, it was mainly due to the influx of foreign capital. The rulers of Russia turned to the French money market for the loans which constantly needed to balance its budget.
Beginning with loans for urgent treasury purposes and railway construction, foreign capital imports began to flow into the coal, iron and steel industries, attracted by largely heavy profits (25-50 %) than it could earn at home. Between 1896 and 1900, a quarter of all new companies were foreign and by 1900 foreign capital accumulated for 28% of the total. By 1914, the proportion had risen to 33%. Foreign capital controlled 45% of Russias oil output, 54% of her iron output, 51% of her chemical industry, nearly 75% of her coal output. More than half the capital of six leading banks of the country-themselves controlling nearly 60% of all banking capital and nearly half of bank deposits- was foreign.
Marxist theories
Between 1878-1800, in St Petersburg and other industrial towns in Russia, numerous workers organisations with a revolutionary programme were continually being formed, even though they were regularly suppressed by the police.
However, the political literature that came out during this period, revealed that their formations and militant activities were being powerfully and energetically reinforced by a stream of Marxist literature, at first smuggled in from abroad and then re-produced by hectograph and secret printing press within the Russian border. This development was a direct result of the organisation called, Emancipation of Labour Group founded in Geneva by Plekhanov.
In this exercise, he was actively supported by Narodnik organisation. During later years the Narodniks shed their ultra-left ideas and accepted the teachings of Marx and Engels. Plekhanov began a series of brilliant polemical explanations of Marxist theories and successfully challenged the ideas of the terrorists, the Narodniks and other advocates of rival theories established in workers ranks. In this emerging revolutionary field, Plekhanovs task was taken over and developed at home cleverly by a young student of a later generation., Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin), whose brother had been executed by the rulers of Russia for having connections with Narodniks in 1887.
Hearing the grave situation in Russia, Lenin came back to his Motherland in 1893 and got deeply involved in the series of strike struggles of the workers. Further, apart from helping the struggles of the workers, he initiated various programmes to establish Marxist study circles in the main cities and also carried out various propaganda works relevant to the changing political situation in the country.

North Korea, the country of the hour
I personally do not believe in destruction (Avi Gattho Aviyen Nasi) as every human being belonging to any race or religion has the right to live in peace and harmony. In the past few months, North Korea has been in the limelight threatening South Korea, Japan and the USA whereas President Donald Trump is being agitated and forced to play his trump card as the entire world is patiently and silently watching in great anxiety as to what calm before the storm means.
We all know the professionalism in Western Diplomacy which is five-star to the hilt, with full-suit attire, served with the finest blend of spirits, with a five-course meal and will put you on top of a Murunga Tree and even nominate you for a Grammy award and finally backstab with a silencer like 008.
They talk about human rights and war crimes. Were they totally deaf and blind when our nation was devastated by a civil war for 27 years Their culture is borrowed, their food is borrowed (Pizza) whereas the Liberty Statue is a gift and the language is slang when the four letter word is commonly used and the only nation which mentions in God we trust in their currency.
The blanket bombing by the B52 bombers in Vietnam is not supposed to be a war crime, whereas approximately around 300,000 illegitimate children fathered by the American soldiers are presumed to be human as they were labeled as a new race called Amerasians. What would have been the consequence if it had been done by us
The most dreaded and deadliest terrorist group went on a rampage and massacred innocent civilians and exploded bombs in warded places during broad daylight.
The attitude of the United Nations was mum because we all know as an open secret as to who controls the United Nations because the self-appointed general of the world needs wounds to sell their weapons of mass destruction simply because the blood money is their main source of income.
The approval given by the Pentagon which is the headquarters building of the USA has five sides and five angles.
I personally feel if South Korea and Iran could develop their military prowess, the balance of military superiority will keep both sides at bay or else the self-appointed five-star bully will be the unconquered ruler of the universe.

COMBANK makes leasing more  affordable with Hybrid Leases
A new leasing product that makes leasing a higher value vehicle more affordable at commencement has been launched by the Commercial Bank of Ceylon especially for upwardly mobile company executives and professionals.
The Banks new Hybrid Lease combines the features of a Super Lease with the option of paying only a comparatively low rental during the first six or 12 months, paying regular rentals thereafter, and a lump sum at the end of the lease.
After the first six or 12 months, a fixed monthly rental can be paid until the penultimate month of the lease. Concluding the lease, a lump sum residual will be recovered as the final months payment.
This product will be offered for both unregistered and registered vehicles, and for sale and lease-back leases, the Bank said.
Commenting on the launch of this new product, Commercial BanksDeputy General Manager Personal Banking Sandra Walgama said, The Hybrid Lease provides an opportunity for vehicle enthusiasts to buy the automobile they aspire to own. They will now be able to purchase a higher value vehicle at an initial lower monthly rental, thanks to the novel repayment structure.
Hybrid Leasesare expected to be most suitable for personal use vehicles from reputable brands that have a high re-sale value. Commercial vehicles too will be considered on a case by case basis, the Bank said.
As an additional service to customers with excellent repayment records, the Bank said it will offer an extension of up to two years on the lease tenure to repay the residual lump sum of the Hybrid Lease granted to unregistered vehicles. This extension is subject to conditions, and if offered, will be treated as a fresh lease facility.
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon had previously launched an easy vehicle leasing product  Super Leasing which allows customers to pay part of the vehicles value at the end of the lease period, enabling monthly instalments to be calculated for only part of the value of the vehicle. This facilitates lessees to pay a lower monthly rental than that of a regular leasing scheme, whilst being able to buy a higher value vehicle.
Commercial Banks overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 19 outlets, Myanmar, where it has a Representative Office in Yangon, the Maldives, where the Bank has a fully-fledged Tier I Bank with a majority stake and Italy, where the Bank operates its own money transfer service.

David Bent to give keynote at 'Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards'
David Bent, world-leading advisor on sustainable business based in the UK, specialist member of Good Karma Consultants, will deliver the keynote address at the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Award 2017 of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, which will be held on November 28 at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel, Colombo.

"We are in a time of profound change. Transformation is inevitable. Countries are developing. People have more options as workers, customers and citizens.

And either we will be forced to adapt to dangerous climate change, or we will transform our economies to avoid it, says Bent.
He will share his experiences of working with world-leading companies which are benefiting from acting now, how they got started and how they spotted the next investment to profit from sustainability. He will also speak about the leading edge of innovation in business, finance and policy around the world.
There will be winners and losers. The best way to predict the future - and win - is to invent it. You have the choice to innovate so you thrive, and Sri Lanka succeeds, in a sustainable world,adds David.
While in Sri Lanka, Bent will also conduct a full day workshop for Chamber members, together with individual workshops for specific corporates who are interested in developing a sustainability focused business model, and taking a leadership role in their industries.

Dayasiri blames CPC officials for petroleum crisis
A lack of adequate petroleum buffer stocks is a major factor in the current fuel crisis, said Co-Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday, as he explained that the government would take the responsibility for such structural deficiencies which have plummeted the country into chaos. Addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing, he added that systematic issues at the level of bureaucracy had allowed the issue to worsen as neither the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) nor the Ministry have a plan to avert the crisis. We have to clearly state that it was the CPC officials who have allowed this to turn into a crisis, Minister Jayasekara said.
Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne in the meantime assured that two ships carrying fuel were scheduled to arrive in Colombo on Wednesday (8) night; one from Singapore and another from India,
By Thursday (9) we should be able to restore supplies in Colombo and by Friday the rest of the country would be covered, the Minister added.
On October 15, a ship carrying petrol for LIOC was rejected after two tests. At the same time, a ship bringing fuel to CPC which was supposed to have reached Sri Lanka on November 2 was delayed until 9 November. To add fuel to the fire, the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery broke down on October 31 due to a power failure and it took three days to be repaired.
They rejected the fuel after the second test because it was pointed out that a third test done by an independent party was liable to be influenced. This was what happened in 2011, when substandard fuel was released to the market,the Minister said. Minister Senaratne said the LIOC could not be blamed for this as they only catered to 16 percent of the market.
The average daily usage of fuel in the country amounts to 2,500 metric tons but due to rumours, of a possible fuel shortage, consumption had shot up to 4000 metric tons last week, he said.
On October 30th, 3,623 metric tons were released, on October 31st 3,045 metric tons, on November 1st 2,880 metric tons, on November 2nd 2,801 metric tons, on November 3rd no petrol was released because it was a Poya Day and November 4th 2,866 metric tons were released. On November 5th once again there was no petrol released as it was a Sunday. Employees dont turn up for distribution on holidays,explained Senaratne. He said that though more petrol than usual was being released to the market, it was still insufficient as people were pumping their tanks full. Cabinet this week also appointed a four member ministerial advisory council to look into the present crisis, identify immediate measures which need to be taken to resolve the crisis, find out those responsible and to recommend remedial measures to avoid a future crisis.
We discussed the problem at length at the Cabinet. The COPE Committee reports clearly indicate that even in the 2011, 2012 fiasco which incurred Rs 8.3 billion in losses, we had problems due to delays in our testing, poor communication, lack of proper planning or forecasting to meet the challenges of a changing market and the Kolonnawa tank with 15,000 metric tons hasnt been repaired for over a year and a half, to name a few, Minister Jayasekara explained.
The Minister also questioned as to why the committee did not request for a ship sooner rather than waiting for the crisis to worsen.
These are jobs of the officials and when they dont perform and it collapses, it comes down on the entire government and the President,Jayasekara said.
The buffer stocks had been increased from 60,000 metric tons in 2015 to 90,000 metric tons at present but that too has been insufficient.
Jayasekara proposed that the Muthurajawela storage be developed further so that stocks could be increased.

Disturbed student told to wear ear plugs
A female undergraduate billed to sit for her finals shortly who went to a Grama Niladhari in the area to complain about the disturbance caused to her studies at night by a neighbour's barking dog had a harrowing experience when the Grama Niladhari advised her to wear ear plugs during study time to overcome the irritation, a report from a village in the outskirts of Alawwa said.
The report said, the family living in the house adjoining the undergraduate's house and property which had bought a dog recently had been in the habit of tying the animal to the fence bordering the two properties at night as a safety measure. The animal had been in the habit of barking at night to overcome loneliness disturbing the girl studying next door. When repeated requests made to neighbours to tie the dog elsewhere failed to earn a positive response, the girl had gone and complained to the Grama Niladhari. The officer had visited the house concerned to advice the occupants to take measures to prevent causing disturbance and the neighbours had responded by keeping dog indoors for several days.
However, they had once again resorted to the earlier practice of tying the dog on to the border fence and the barking had started once again as usual disturbing the girl in her studies.
The girl had gone and complained to the Grama Niladhari once more.
The Grama Niladhari had then said that there is no legal provision to take action regarding such issues and requested the girl to wear ear plugs when studying at night and even gone to the extent of demonstrating the manner it could be done.

Dreaming  of soft hands
How to make your hands soft
1. Warm Water:
Soaking your hands in warm water is a brilliant technique for soft hands. You must get the temperature right as warm water dries the skin. Add a few drops of Lavender oil or Rose essential oil to the water. To create a fragrant and soothing experience, you can soak your hands in a basin full of warm water for ten minutes. You will feel your hands become softer, and your neighbors kid wont scream when you pinch his cheeks!

2. Vaseline:
Vaseline is one of the most widely used moisturizers today. You should wash your hands with warm water as directed above and coat your hands with Vaseline every night before you go to bed. Alternatively, you can wear cotton gloves while sleeping. You will wake up with smooth and spongy hands the next morning. If you dont have Vaseline, any old moisturizer will do.

3. Sugar And Olive Oil:
This one-minute remedy is a real winner. You can do this before you head to a party, or even if you are going out on a date. Mix 1 tablespoon of Olive Oil with a tablespoon of sugar and work it into a paste. Work the paste into your hands, paying equal attention to the palm and the cuticles. Olive oil is a great moisturizer, while sugar helps remove dead cells. Holding hands will be a divine experience for your partner.

4. Cream:
Malai or Cream is an effective home remedy for soft hands. This remedy is one of the simplest ones on here. Take a bit of Malai or homemade ghee and work it into the palms, nail beds, and cuticles. For best results, leave the malai on for half an hour. Wash off with warm water, avoid using soap. Although, your hands will still be a bit slick with the malai most of it will be washed away by the warm water. Your hands will become softer within a week.

5. Gram Flour And Curd:
Besan or Bengal gram flour can be used for things besides coating pakodas. Besan has been known to be great for all types of skin, being used to treat acne, remove discoloration and add glow to the skin. When mixed with curd, it can be used to treat dry and rough hands. Work besan and curd into a paste and apply generously to the hands. Wash it off in 15 minutes and your hands will feel as soft as a feather.

6. Butter And Almond Oil:
Another effective remedy to get those supple hands is a mixture of butter and almond oil. Butter lubricates the skin and the Vitamin E rich almond oil decreases fine lines and wrinkles. To make the mixture, take two teaspoons of butter and add 1 teaspoon of almond oil. Apply this evenly on your hands and leave the mixture on for 20 minutes. Wash it off with warm water and voila, and see how soft your hands feel.

7. Egg Yolk, Honey And Almonds:
Egg yolk contains high amounts of Vitamin A, while almonds boost the Vitamin E content in your skin. This mixture exfoliates, moisturizes and nourishes your hands, giving you those supple hands you deserve. Add 1 tsp of honey,  tsp of crushed almonds and a hint of rose water to an egg yolk. Work them into a paste. Massage your hands with this mixture for 10 minutes and let it stay for 15-20 minutes before rinsing it off with warm water.

8. Wear Gloves:
The main reason most women have rough hands is due to household chores, exposure to hard water and detergents, which sap moisture from ones hands. Although this is not truly a remedy, wearing rubber gloves while working in the kitchen or handling detergents can help you avoid dry and rough hands. Wearing cotton gloves overnight can also help rejuvenate the skin on your hands.

9. Abrasive Hand Wash:
We know all about the germ killing antiseptic hand wash that is supposed to keep your hands free from germs. What they dont tell you is how the liquid will drain your hands of the much needed moisture. So, one way to get soft hands is to choose a moisturizing hand wash. Try to wash your hands with warm water as often as you can. Remember to pat your hands dry instead of rubbing them with a hand-towel.

10. Lemon And Sugar:
This is one of the oldest and most trusted remedies for soft hands. Take a half cut lemon and coat it with sugar. Scrub the lemon into the cuticles and the nail beds and the flat of your palm. Leave the mixture on for a minute before washing the mixture of, preferably with warm water. Pat your hands dry. This is one of the fastest remedies for soft hands.
Now that you know how to make hands soft and smooth naturally, let us know if youll give these remedies a try. Do tell us whether any of these home remedies has worked for you. Please share your thoughts below!

Exemplary Voyages joins  World Animal Protection
The Sri Lankan inbound tour operator, Exemplary Voyages (Pvt) Ltd recently joined the World Animal Protection (WAP) to extend its support towards the globalized animal rights protection initiative.
Exemplary Voyages which signed the World Animal Protection Pledge (WAPP) in Colombo became the countrys first company to join World Animal Protection Organization.
Speaking to Daily News Business, Exemplary Voyages General Manager Dhanushka Wijeyekoon said the World Animal Protection Organization invited Exemplary Voyages to support this initiative after considering the contribution made by the company to carry out responsible tourism in Sri Lanka.
Signing of this pledge will add more value to the animal welfare activities in the countrys tourism industry, he said.
Wijeyekoon highlighted that World Animal Protection which was established 50 years ago to protect animals around the world is one of the worlds leading animal welfare organizations.
He said the main objective of this initiative is to create the awareness among all sectors, especially local tour operators and local and foreign tourists, on the importance of protecting animal welfare.
Being a responsible inbound tour operator, we took this animal welfare initiative to promote sustainable tourism in the country and also to limit such activities where animals are harassed for commercial purposes, he said.
Wijeyekoon further said that vast range of animals are used by local tourism stakeholders to please tourists, especially foreign tourists even without considering the plight of innocent animals.
He said the WAPO is actively engaged in over 50 countries and has close rapport with animal rights protection.
Wijeyekoon further said that it is a privilege for the Exemplary Voyages to join World Animal Protection as the first Sri Lankan company. He further stated that they have planned to educate thousands of their clients who visit Sri Lanka about the importance of animal welfare.
Animal welfare is a contemporary business issue especially in the tourism industry where various animals are used for entertainment proposes, but if we closely look at this we will see the facilities given to animals are not suitable, he said.
Accordingly, the Exemplary Voyages has decided to contribute to the betterment of the animals and voice their opinion about the importance of animal welfare.

Federal Reserve gains a plumber-in-chief with Jay Powell
On the eve of his official nomination as the next chair of the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell was addressing an industry roundtable on the efforts to move the financial system away from Libor, the disgraced global interest rate benchmark.
Although the 64-year-olds remarks to the New York Fed were prerecorded, his willingness to dive into the minutiae of interest rates illustrates how the policymaker has embraced the nitty-gritty of financial market structure more than most since he joined the Fed board in 2012.
At some point during his stint at the helm of the Fed, Powell will probably find the experience and knowledge he has accumulated in the plumbing of financial markets tested. Under the former private equity executive, the Fed will face the task of managing a turning point in policy as officials shrink a $4.5tn balance sheet the US central bank amassed fighting the financial crisis and shielding the economy from its fallout.
While Janet Yellen has gingerly begun this task, Powell will continue the retreat with US corporate bond markets trading near record highs and stocks reaching new peaks. The big concern for investors is that as the Fed  and other central banks  retreat from QE, changes in how securities are traded, namely how capital-constrained banks are reluctant to act as market makers in bonds and credit, raise the risk of a major shock in financial markets. In the environment that we are in now, having someone who understands the plumbing of financial markets is very positive, says Nathan Sheets, now chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income after a stint at the Treasury, where he worked closely with the central bank official. Governor Powell certainly fits that bill. Powell, who will also have a slew of fresh governors, including a new head of the New York Fed after Bill Dudley said on Monday that he would be leaving next year, has voiced optimism that a gradual reduction in the Feds holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities will be orderly. However, he has also warned that the fragility of an outdated market structure  yet to fully adjust to a new breed of tech-savvy traders that have become more prominent in the $14tn US government bond market  may spell problems.
Most of the time in most markets liquidity is OK. But it may be more fragile, and more prone to disappearing in stress situations, he told the FT last year. There hasnt been a liquidity-related incident that has had a significant effect on the real economy. That doesnt mean it wont happen.
As a Fed governor, his interest derives from the central banks responsibility to ensure stability of the financial system, where Treasuries are the chief source of collateral for many institutions and clearing houses which back vast amounts of derivatives trading. US government debt also plays a key role in portfolios for domestic and foreign investors. He has voiced support for central clearing of repo trades that are integral to the functioning of the broader Treasury market.
He has shown a strong interest in this part of the market and so we are optimistic and confident that will continue, says Paul Hamill, global head of fixed income trading at Citadel Securities. We feel strongly that there are some sensible things that should be implemented.
But it is an interest that is also rooted in his experiences as an undersecretary in the US Treasury in the early 1990s, when he sat on a committee probing Salomon Brothers after the investment bank sought to rig Treasury auctions and was fined for infractions of the rules. The episode still gives me nightmares, Powell said last month.
Some Fed observers pointed to Powells willingness to re-assess capital requirements and rules implemented since the financial crisis, such as the Volcker rule that prohibits banks from proprietary trading, as sharpening his appeal to a White House that has vowed to de-regulate. (Financial Times)

Finance Minister presents  maiden Budget today
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera will deliver his maiden Budget speech in Parliament (Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill) today. It would be a development-oriented Budget, giving sweeping benefits for entrepreneurs to kickstart businesses.
In a brief media event at the Finance Ministry, Minister Samaraweera said that benefits would also be offered to the agri sector, education, exports and imports; the Budget would also encourage a green economy. This budget would one aimed at strengthening families.
The Minister recalled a Chinese proverb which said that its better to teach a man to fish rather than giving him fish to eat and said that this theory too would be a cornerstone of the Budget. We dont want to offer short-term benefits, but give long-term sustainable benefits in the Budget.
Asked to comment on the rising prices and price control of some essential goods, the Minister said that he was against price controls. Its an open economy and market forces should decide prices.
The government also reduced prices of essential items by reducing the special commodity tax. To absorb this, government would allocate Rs. 1.5 billion each month.
Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said that Minister Samaraweera was the Minister of Finance for just six months and during that time too several concessions were offered to the public. These included the reducing of tax on single cabs, Batta lorries, lowering of telecom and other income taxes.
Government expenditure for next year is estimated to be Rs 3,982,367 million with Rs 1,308,939 million spent on recurrent expenditure, while Rs 668,324 million has been allocated for capital expenditure. Revenue including foreign grants is estimated at Rs 2,175,000 million.
Sri Lankas total borrowing requirement from both foreign and local sources for next year will be Rs 1,813 billion. The debate on the second reading will start on November 10 and the third reading and vote will be on December 9.

Fortunaglobal introduces affluence  soft token for local banking
Colombo-based Fortunaglobal, a leader in omni-channel banking software solutions for Sri Lanka's FinTech sector has started rolling out its software (soft) token solution to local banks.
Offering up a higher level of security that is time based, this solution is a better option when compared to the more expensive hardware tokens.
Part of Fortunaglobal's Affluence omni-channel banking and financial services platform, which is widely recognized as being the benchmark for Sri Lanka's FinTech sector, the Affluence Soft Token is a software-based security token that generates an One Time Password (OTP).
For banks and financial institutions that are looking to introduce additional layers of security, especially for overseas clients who significantly benefit from a short-lived OTP via SMS, this solution offers a great relief from a major pain point. Further, easy integration, via standard APIs, with any third party solution is an added advantage. Importantly, the solution works seamlessly with any banks existing Internet Banking or Mobile Banking solution.
A replacement for hardware tokens, this solution provides a distinct OTP for each activity, from a shared secret key that is unique to the mobile application installed on one's smart device.
Affluence Soft Tokens add even greater levels of security to Affluence-based banking transactions since, even if an user's traditional password is stolen or compromised, attackers cannot gain access without the OTP, which changes after a set period of time.
The benefits of the Affluence Soft Token also include its flexibility and ease of use, while also being very cost effective in comparison to the more expensive hardware tokens. An OTP can also be generated offline, without the requirement of any sort of network coverage.
Further, the Affluence Soft Token also offers numerous other features, from secure transactions with two factor authentications, to allowing end-users to securely generate the OTP from their desired mobile device, as well as giving them the option to revoke and re-activate Soft Tokens using the same simple activation process. It even provides enhanced compatibility with a wide range of mobile devices.
Commenting, Fortunaglobal CEO Suren Kohombange said, Not only is our Affluence Soft Token solution cost effective compared to more expensive hardware tokens, it also offers greater security.
At the same time, it continues to be flexible and simple to use. All the hallmarks of a revolutionary product that can help banks and financial service companies immeasurably.

This novel initiative is among the first of its kind to make an appearance on Colombos food scene, which over the years has acquired a unique identity of its own while still keeping up with global culinary trends.
Veganism has taken the world by storm as a movement that is centred on healthy, plant-based eating and perhaps more importantly, it has been shown to have a positive impact on our planet. There is a growing understanding of the environmental cost of meat production and other agricultural issues which makes the idea of a vegetable-driven diet more attractive and, for some, also the responsible thing to do.
Guests will be treated to a completely vegan experience, free from any animal products used in food preparation or presentation. With the increasing interest on healthy living and widespread awareness on sustainably sourced products, the Galle Face Hotel wanted to introduce Vegan Week in order to do our part in promoting this movement. We also introduced this initiative to be more inclusive and cater to the growing community of vegans here in Colombo stated The Galle Face Hotel, General Manager, Deni Ohlsen-Dukic. The events are open to anyone interested in trying out vegan food. It is possible to eat a completely plant-based diet which is not only healthy but delicious, added Ohlsen-Dukic.
Vegan Culinary Workshop
Vegan Week at the Galle Face Hotel kicks off with a culinary workshop on November 13 from 6 to 8 pm. The workshop will be hosted by Chef Tora who flew in from Sweden for this especially curated Vegan Week. As a food and meal scientist, Chef Tora will provide information on veganism and share recipes for clean eating. The workshop will be conducted in partnership with the Sri Lanka Youth Climate Action Network (SLYCAN). The workshop will also touch on a global movement called #MeatlessMondays which has a very simple message: once a week, cut the meat. Chef Tora will talk to guests about how going meatless as little as once a week can affect the health of our planet.
Vegan Cocktail
On November 17, the Galle Face Hotel will treat guests to a completely Vegan cocktail event with all-natural nibbles, and dessert. The ingredients are cruelty-free and locally sourced, with all natural products used for flavour and colour.

Green light from people for new Constitution: Bishop
The Methodist Church Sri Lanka expresses its appreciation to all the political parties that have remained involved in the process and exercise of drafting a new Constitution, without giving into the attempts made by certain politicians and even religious personnel to bring to a halt, a mandate that the people of this country clearly gave at the elections held in 2015, said Methodist Church President /Bishop Rev. Asiri P. Perera.
Issuing a statement, the Bishop said, We should not forget the fact that both Mahinda Rajapaksa (who received 47% votes) and President Maithripala Sirisena (who received 51%votes) pledged to the people of Sri Lanka that they would bring in a new Constitution if they were elected the President of the country on the 8th of January 2015. Therefore, all right thinking people of Sri Lanka must realize that the green light for a new Constitution has already been given by 98% of the people who voted at the Presidential Election on January 8th, 2015. The statement added: All those who now try to bring to a halt the exercise of formulating a new Constitution must realize that they are acting against the will of the majority of the people in Sri Lanka and we as a Church call upon all such persons and groups to kindly give up their campaign and stop their irresponsible actions and join in the process of formulating a new Constitution.
It is no doubt there are differences of opinion when formulating a Constitution that seeks to satisfy all sections of people who live in a country like ours. But these should be first debated at the appropriate forums rather than dragging them to the streets to provoke the masses through unhealthy slogans.
The Methodist Church of Sri Lanka entreats all people of our land and especially the Christians to pray and get involved in healthy discussions and dialogue that promotes the need to find a lasting solution to a burning issue that has cost so many valuable lives in our country, and resolve the same through appropriate constitutional change."

Holding LG polls on electoral basis ensures democracy: SB
In accordance with election pledges of the Yahapalana government, it is now possible to hold the Local Government election on the electoral basis ensuring democracy and the peoples franchise, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S.B.Dissanayake said.
According to this system, an MP will be elected from each electorate while a number of MPs from each political party will be decided on the number of votes obtained by them.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, the Minister said this system will prevent candidates campaigning based on race, cast and religions.
Although the UNP and Joint Opposition wanted to retain PR system, the SLFP was against it from the beginning, he added.
The Minster further said that JO is keen to show that the government and President Maithripala Sirisena are yearning to join with their Pohottuwa party. But, the actual situation is that JO members are coming behind SLFPers requesting to recruit them.
The JO members want to show that President and the government want to recruit them, but, they are not joining with them.
But, the real situation is many members in the JO are calling us day and night suggesting that they like to join with us at least on the temporary agreement. However, we also believe it is good for both parties to join hands and working forward. That is why President made an open invitation for all to join with the party.
He added that It is President Maithripala Sirisena who ended the practice of poaching MPs belonging to one party to another. I can state with responsibility that 11 politicians of the JO tried very hard to join the UNP.
Some people were on the verge of joining and several others were not accepted into the UNP. But, after discussions between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe,the practice of grabbing MPs from one party to another party was stopped.

The National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry and the Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry are patronizing the housing promotion project.
The programme is coordinated by District Planning Director Sugath Nayanananda. Nayanananda told the Daily News that the request intimated to the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry to allocate 5,000 new houses out of the 50,000 housing package being donated to the North by the Indian government to those families who had undergone untold hardships during the past, where terrorism and war were prevailing.
The planning director further said that this request was answered with a positive response.
We are planning to distribute these 5,000 houses to the needy families residing in the Mahavilachchiya, Nuwaragam Palatha (Central), Medawachchiya, Kebithigollewa, Padaviya, Horowpothana, Kahatagasdigiliya and Palugaswewa DS divisions situated along the boundary villages belt extending from Nochchiyagama to Habarana.
In addition to these, another batch of 85 new houses are to be offered to the low-income families in the Medawachchiya, Kebithigollewa, Padaviya, Horowpothana, and Maha Vilachchiya DS divisions, under the patronage of the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry, he added.
Construction of 10 houses have been completed in the Yakawewa, Thammenna Elawaka, Anekattiya and Periyakulama Grama Niladhari divisions in the Medawachchiya Divisional Secretariat jurisdiction.
Nayanananda said that the construction work of 47 houses have already been completed and that one house costs Rs. 800,000.
Under this housing programme, arrangements are in progress for commissioning 16 drinking water supply projects in the Kebithigollewa, Mahavilachchiya, Horowpothana, Padaviya and Medawachchiya areas.

How smartphone security  ushers in a new age of banking
First it was passwords. Then it was fingerprints. Now it is iris and facial recognition. The latest features on your smartphone are a key part of the evolving banking experience.
The debut of the original iPhone 10 years ago not only marked the dawn of the smartphone era, but also laid the groundwork for the development of mobile banking. Prior to 2007, customers had to make their way to a branch or an ATM to do their banking. Online banking was an option, but it offered limited on-the-go convenience at a time when Wi-Fi was patchy and PCs were heavy. Today, because smartphones seldom leave our hands, the distance between customers and banks has been all but eliminated.
The proliferation of smartphones is central to the stellar rise of mobile banking as a preferred method of managing money, yet it is often forgotten that early mobile platforms were little more than an extension of online banking. Remember the time when an entire website was just dumped onto an app without adjusting for the drastic reduction in screen size We may have the smartphone to thank for the clutter-free interface now found on mobile and online banking platforms.
An overlooked fact  which also happens to be a major difference between mobile banking and online banking  is that your smartphone is also a smart security device. Only a few years ago, in order to log on to your online banking account, you would need to pull out your physical security device (which you most definitely did not carry with you at all times), punch in your personal identification number so that you could generate a security code, and input said code before time expired. Nowadays your smartphone can do all the heavy lifting in user identification and verification. On many phones, all you need to do is scan your fingerprint to access your account and make a transaction.
The unveiling of the latest iPhone has drummed up plenty of interest around its new features and how some of them will be applied in banking. The launch of Face ID on the iPhone X will likely help popularize facial recognition as a form of user identification and verification. In fact, HSBCs customers in China can already add payees and transfer money with a selfie. According to our research, more than 60% of Chinese believe that biometrics such as facial and fingerprint recognition will be the only way to access banking services within 10 years.
Advances in biometrics technology mean passwords may soon become a thing of the past, for you are your password. Voice recognition, which checks a large number of vocal characteristics, including cadence, speed and pronunciation, allows customers to access phone banking without a security number. The cutting edge in iris recognition analyzes the veins in the white of an eye, adding an extra level of security to mobile banking. Small 3D scanners can record and recognize the unique pattern of veins in a finger, and some banks have piloted finger vein scanners on ATMs.
It is too early to tell which technology will become the preferred or standard method of identification and verification, but we know for a fact that banks must remain vigilant in protecting customer data, including biometric data.
Another new iPhone feature that will play a more prominent role  if not in the current generation of smartphones, then surely in future ones  is augmented reality (AR). Some banks are already using AR to help customers locate branches and ATMs, while others display offers and deals to customers when they walk by or into shops.
It is not difficult to imagine AR being used in a more advanced manner. Perhaps you see a car you like. Once your smartphone recognizes the model and the price, it offers you a number of payment options, illustrating the interest rates, the number of payments and the amount repayable, including any charges. When you find an option that best suits you, you can complete the purchase  right there and then  and authenticate it with biometrics.
We are now 10 years into the smartphone era, but advances in information and communications technology are still only beginning to transform the way we bank. It is impossible to predict with certainty how banking will look in 10 years time, just as a decade ago no one could have imagined that we would all be carrying banks in our pockets. What is certain is that banks application of innovation and technology will make the banking experience simpler, better, faster and more secure.
The future of banking will be a mix of brick-and-mortar and digital solutions. The role of the branch has already shifted: walk into a branch nowadays and it is increasingly common that customers are there seeking professional financial advice or assistance with complex transactions. Your smartphone, meanwhile, offers you the convenience of doing simple transactions anytime, anywhere.
Bank innovation has always shaped  and been shaped by  customer behavior. But as phenomenal a tool as technology is, ultimately banking is all about relationships. Achieving the right balance between technology and the human touch is the recipe for providing the best possible banking experience.

## Title: INCLUSIVE COOPERATION IN THE INDIAN OCEAN REGION

## Date: Thursday, November 9, 2017 - 01:00
INCLUSIVE COOPERATION IN THE INDIAN OCEAN REGION
Profound and complex changes are taking place in the current world regarding geopolitical and economic circumstances, with opportunities and challenges driving ahead. During the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Chinese President Xi Jinping called on the people of all countries to work together with other friendly countries toward a new form of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice, and win-win cooperation and a community with a shared future for mankind, and work together with the people of all countries to build an open, inclusive, clean, and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security, and common prosperity.
Every country should respect each other, discuss issues as equals, resolutely reject the cold war mentality and power politics, and take a new approach to develop state-to-state relations with communication, not confrontation, and partnership, not alliance. Indian Ocean Region (IOR) keeps a good momentum while immense unsteadiness and uncertainties parasitize. China has always devoted itself to safeguarding peace and stability of IOR and promoting common development for IOR featuring harmony, cooperation and win-win result. China insists on that inclusive cooperation is the sole path for a bright future of IOR.
Carrying forward the Thousand-Year Silk Road
Thousands of years ago, China and Indian Ocean (IOR) countries started cultural exchanges and trade. Throughout history, the Chinese civilization reached the world and Chinese learned from the outside world by its endless fleet of ships, resulting in the Maritime Silk Road, which benefited generations by generations with its connectivity.
The Ancient Maritime Silk Road founded itself the artery of transportation for Asia, Europe and Africa. Faced with harsh conditions, countless envoys, monks and dealers of dynasties made their way to the West on this artery to learn and to trade. Therefore, the abundant products and advanced production tools were introduced to IO countries. Moreover, the Chinese civilization including Confucius thoughts, laws and regulations, clothing, plantation, architecture and relevant technologies reached the IO coast, which propelled its economic development and social progress. Meanwhile, Buddhism, agro-products and crafts from IOR, were introduced to China along the Silk Road.
The long-standing trade, culture and people-to-people exchanges never ceased away but were renewed with long time river. More than 600 years ago, Chinese navigator Zheng He, heading fleets of over 200 ships and 27,000 crew members, travelled to the West Pacific and IO for 7 times and made himself a legend in this Region. The giant fleets visited more than 30 countries including Sri Lanka, India and Kenya. Zheng He stayed in Sri Lanka as Envoy for 5 times. The voyage of Zheng He largely deepened relations between China and Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central East and African countries. Since the fleet of Zheng He experienced a few fights against the pirates, they enjoyed generally freedom and security of navigation in most time of their voyages.
Deepening cooperation and bound together
Under the context of globalization, IOR in some sense has ever become one of the global prosperous centers. Moreover, South Asia becoming the most promising Sub-Continent in the 21st Century. Fortunately, Alfred Thayer Mahan's prediction made in 1890 that Whoever controls the Indian Ocean will dominate Asia might not be realized, because no one could dominate the IO and common development and sharing are the main trend which will be sustained.
With a vast territory, China shares borders with 5 countries from South Asia and most southwest provinces of China hold intimate geographical ties with South Asian countries and deeper and longer linkage with their South Asia neighbours than with eastern Asian countries. Being not only the good neighbour and friend of inter-dependent and mutual support for South Asia countries, China is inseparable for South Asia and IRO. Future and destiny of China and IO countries are closely linked together. Viewing from this perspective, China is definitely part of South Asia and IO.
Since 2014, President of the Peoples Republic of China Xi Jinping made historic visits to South Asian countries including Sri Lanka, Maldive, Bangladesh and Pakistan, starting a new chapter for good neighbourly and friendly relations.
China has ever deepened practical cooperation with South Asian countries in the field of sustainable development, trade and economic cooperation, people-to-people exchanges, combating pirates, alleviating poverty and disaster relief, etc. Trading volume between China and South Asian countries witnessed a rapid growth, which reached 110.7 billion USD in 2016, accounting for 3.2% of total trading volume for China with the world. In recent five years, China has provided more than 10,000 scholarships and training opportunities for South Asia countries. Referring to Sri Lanka, China provided 1,300 scholarships and training opportunities in 2015, 1500 in 2016 and this figure has exceeded 2000 for 2017. For a consecutive of three years, Sri Lanka received more foreign-aid training resources from China than any other country.
China is a great trade power. Nearly 40% of its foreign trade goods has to transport through Indian Ocean shipping line. Each year, more than 5,000 merchant ships depart from China or travel to China through the route, navigating around South Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Safeguarding the freedom of navigation and security in the Indian Ocean are major interests and concerns of China.
China stands as a major force for the development, peace and stability in the Indian Ocean Region. China actively participates in the UNs escort missions and anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden. By 2016, China has dispatched 25 batches of naval fleets, 78 vessels, 54 helicopters and 21,000 people to conduct escort missions for about 6,300 Chinese and foreign passing ships. China successfully rescued over 60 vessels in distress by then. It fully embodies Chinas effective exercise of maintaining freedom of navigation and security and the responsibility of major power. China shares the common fate with the regional countries consistently. China is also an active member of ReCAAP (Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia) which covers more than 30 countries along the Indo-Pacific Region including ASEAN nations, Australia, Sri Lanka, Japan, Korea, India, Pakistan, Denmark, Netherlands, UK, US and etc,.
As the Chinas Governor of the ReCAAP, I envisioned the cooperation on combating piracy and safeguard the navigation freedom in Indian Ocean. As one of the vital users of the Indian Ocean shipping lane, China has proved that no country is more eager than China to maintain a peaceful and secure, united and cooperative, and prosperous Indian Ocean family. China will continue its commitment to enhance relations with countries in the Indian Ocean region, making positive contributions to promoting regional peace, stability and prosperity.
Soon after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Chinese government provided humanitarian emergency assistance to the affected countries along the Indian Ocean coast, donating CNY 522 million (Rs. 12 billion) in total and sending medical rescue teams and professional rescue units to help the affected countries to carry out rescue and reconstruction. Chinese society and public also donated CNY 290 million (Rs. 6.6 billion) to the victims in the disaster areas. For the past two years, China has provided a great deal of assistance for the drought and floods in Sri Lanka every year, amounting to Rs. 940 million, and committed itself to the reconstruction.
I noticed seriously that Alice Wells, Acting Assistant Secretary of the State of the United States, recently claimed in the Congress that unsustainable debt burdens for Sri Lanka were made out of Chinese non-concessional loans. It is completely unfounded statement. Instead, she stated that the United States was the largest grant provider of assistance to Sri Lanka. In fact, most of Chinese loans to Sri Lanka are concessional, with a fixed rate of 2.0%, and Chinese government has to provide a large amount of financial subsidies on interest payment.
Economic and social development in Sri Lanka
China's concessional loans support projects including hydro-projects, power plants, roads, railways, ports, airports and other infrastructure building, playing an important role for the economic and social development of Sri Lanka. As a developing country, China has done its utmost to help developing countries through bilateral cooperation and South-South cooperation mechanisms. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China's total assistance to Sri Lanka has amounted to more than CNY 10 billions (Rs.220 billion). From 2014 to 2017, China offered CNY 1.5 billion (Rs.33 billion) as aid given gratis to Sri Lanka, and China will offer CNY 2 billion (Rs.47 billion) to Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2020. The Chinese granted projects, such as Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall, Nelum Pokuna Theatre, Kidney disease hospital, Cancer funds etc., serve Sri Lanka society and public well and for sure, it is obvious to all. China always respects Sri Lanka's sovereignty and internal affairs, offering aid given gratis without any attached political conditions, only requiring it to be used for people's livelihood and benefit the general public as much as possible.
According to the United Nations resolution, developed countries are urged to donate their 0.7% of GDP on providing assistance to developing countries. In fact, most countries, except some European countries like the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway, did not fulfill their obligations. Chinese people are most against those who are rich but not benevolent, and Chinese culture promotes kindness, harmony and relief. China will continue to do what we can and what we promise, in helping developing countries including Sri Lanka, in the way of action rather than Carrots plus Sticks or talking approach.

India claim first T20 series win over New Zealand
Thiruvananthapuram: Virat Kohlis India beat New Zealand in a tense eight over a side clash to take a first T20 series against the Kiwis and strengthen their claim to be the worlds best team.
Rain reduced the third match of the series in Thiruvananthapuram to a 48 ball lottery and Kohlis side were stronger in the boundary chase and smarter in the bowling battle.
While Manish Pandey hit 17 off 11 balls, Hardik Pandya made 14 and Kohli 13 in Indias 67-5, the home side owe a particular debt to man-of-the-match bowler Jasprit Bumrah in the six run victory.
His two overs cost just nine runs while he claimed the key wickets of big-hitting Colin Munro and Henry Nicholls. Indian coach Ravi Shastri hailed Bumrah, who cannot get a Test place, as a thinking bowler.
Pandey and Kohli both hit a six and a four in quickfire innings that New Zealand just could not match as they reached 61-6.
Pandey went to a spectacular catch off Trent Boult that highlighted a night of brilliant fielding. He fired the ball toward the long-on boundary producing a full length dive by Mitchell Santner who deflected the ball to stop it going over the line and set up the catch by Colin de Grandhomme.
New Zealand started aggressively. Munro hit his first ball for a six, but made only seven before he was caught in the second over trying to hit Bumrah.
Captain Kane Williamson and Glenn Phillips went in successive balls in the fifth over leaving New Zealand facing a struggle to defend their number one place in 20 over cricket.
Though the result could have gone either way with just two balls remaining, New Zealand reached just 61-6 with de Grandhomme making an unbeaten 17.
You would be lying if you said you were not tense, said Shastri. They saved the best for the last in terms of fielding, the electricity was there.
Shastri said that while 67 was not an automatic match-winning score, the fielding and good start by the bowlers had put pressure on New Zealand.
India had never beaten New Zealand in a T20 match going into this series. New Zealands defeat means Pakistan are the number one ranked 20 over nation again. New Zealand also lost a one day series in India but Williamson said they had still come out of the tour stronger.
It is a difficult place to play, said Williamson. They are possibly the best team in the world.
By many counts, India are the best team. They lead the Test rankings, while Kohli is top-rated batsman in one-day and T20 internationals. Bumrah is the number one bowler in T20.
The Indians have not lost a home series in any format since being beaten by South Africa in one day games in 2015.
We have won a few on the trot and it makes us very proud, said Kohli.
India must now prepare for a three Test series against Sri Lanka starting November 16 in Kolkata. AFP

Inflation should stabilize  at 4-6% in 1Q 2018 - CB
Inflation which is at a high of 8.6% is expected to stabilize at 4-6%, Central Bank Governor Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy said Tuesday. He said that apart from the adjustment for VAT and anticipated easing of supply-side disruptions in agriculture, todays Budget may bring relief to consumers.
Although Sri Lankas rate of inflation, particularly headline inflation, is higher than anticipated, core inflation was at manageable levels, the Governor said. Headline inflation accelerated due to high food inflation, the Central Bank said.
Dr Coomaraswamy was speaking at the news conference to present the Central Banks seventh monetary policy review, at which the Bank opted to keep interest rates steady ahead of todays Budget.
For September 2017, the year-on-year headline NCPI (National Consumer Price Index) was 8.6%. However, the core rate of year-on-year NCPI for September 2017 was 4.6%. The headline CCPI (Colombo Consumer Price Index) for September 2017 was 7.8%, while core inflation for the month stood at 6%.
Headline inflation is a measure of the total inflation within an economy, including commodities such as food and energy prices, which tend to be much more volatile and prone to inflationary spikes.
Core inflation is a measure which excludes transitory or temporary price volatility in commodities such as food items, energy products.
The Governor said that at the beginning of 2017, two peaks for inflation were anticipated  one around March and the next, at around this time of the year. But the rate of inflation was higher than predicted.
He said nevertheless, it was core inflation that reflected actual demand in the economy. It was demand-side pressures that that the Central Bank could address.
The peak in inflation was not due to demand-side pressure, but due to supply-side weather-related disruptions and tax adjustments, particularly VAT, which was enforced in November 2016. The country has seen three agricultural seasons hit by drought, while floods and consequent landslides in May 2017 hit the islands Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern and Central Provinces, further weakening agriculture output.
Dr Coomaraswamy said that since present inflation levels were caused by factors outside the influence of the Central Bank, tackling inflation with monetary policy measures was not appropriate.
However, if headline inflation persists at a high level for some time, that can get translated into rate pressure.
The Governor said that inflation therefore needs to be closely monitored for demand-side pressure. Dr Coomaraswamy was however hopeful of a drop in inflation for two reasons  in November 2017, the effects of VAT which came into effect in November 2016 would be reflected, while it was hoped that supply side disruption to agriculture would ease, with prevailing favourable weather conditions.
He said that if the government is able to maintain fiscal discipline and the Central Bank maintains good monetary policy, demand-side pressures on inflation can be controlled.

Interbrand announces  Best Indian Brands 2017
Interbrand, the world's largest and most influential brand consultancy, has released its 2017 Best Indian Brands Report, the definitive growth guide to the Top 40 brands in India.
The Best Indian Brands Report complements Interbrand's Best Global Brands Report, the most prestigious brand ranking table globally, which is based on a unique combination of attributes that contribute to a brand's cumulative value: the financial performance of the branded products and services, the role the brand plays in influencing customer choice and the strength the brand has to command a premium price or secure earnings for the company.
For five consecutive years, Tata Group has continued to hold the top position. It has proven to be an interesting year in the world of brands and businesses; despite Airtel's strong performance, Reliance jumped into #2 which brings to light the success driven by the launch of Jio, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries that provides wireless 4G LTE service in the country.
HDFC Bank, ranked at 4, is followed by Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), State Bank of India, Infosys, Mahindra, ICICI and Godrej rounding out the Top 10. The best growth performances belong to Maruti, Reliance, HDFC, JSW and Kotak, as these brands understand the relevance of purpose centricity, technology, and brand, which contributed to their growth. More than half of the Best Indian Brands came from five sectors: Automotive (5), Diversified (10), Financial Services (12), Telecom (2), and Technology (2). Automotive is one of the top growing sectors and leading the change is Maruti Suzuki, which posted a 19% increase in brand value from 2016.
Breaking into Best Indian Brands for the first time at #17 is Royal Enfield, an Indian motorcycle manufacturing company, with a brand value of INR 90.8 billion, riding on its successful year on year financial performance and successful branding efforts which have been consistently executed across touch points.
Another new entrant comes from the basic materials sector - Ambuja Cement at #40 with a brand value of INR 15.18 billion. Given its strong financial performance, and despite the impact of demonetization and its recent merger with ACC, Ambuja is staged to drive growth.
The Best Global Brands understand that brands are the platform for growth. A quick look at the top growing brands confirms how outgrowing the now and changing at the speed of life creates admirable value growth, said Ashish Mishra, Managing Director, Interbrand India. Encouragingly, the top growing Best Indian Brands also have begun to understand and demonstrate the levers that drive growth and value.
The Top 40 Indian Brands have a combined total value of INR 4755.7 billion, an increase of 5% from 2016.

## Title: JOHN  MILTON:  WHY HE INSPIRED  THE WORLD
## Supertitle:

JOHN  MILTON:  WHY HE INSPIRED  THE WORLD
He was responsible for the brilliant and fierce pamphlets that included the famous defence of literature in Aeropacitica (1644) when poetry was pushed back into doledrums during the Civil War. He dared the system to do so, he who rose to write his monumental work for which he is best remembered, Paradise Lost.
John Milton (1608-74) always had luck on his side especially on his writing efforts based on religious and political convictions. One such, On The Morning of Christ's Nativity zoomed his early popularity. As luck followed him, he had the signal honour bestowed on him by an audience with Pope Urban VII arranged by the most powerful man in Rome, Cardinal Francesco Barberini who was the councilor and uncle to the Pope. Milton being a strong Protestant made no difference to the Pope who was amazed at his credentials. Young Milton was only thirty years old and conversant in Latin and Italian as well as in English that impressed the Pope.
FATHER'S INFLUENCE John Miton's father was a composer that made his son with a lifelong embrace for music though he did not peruse a career in music that his father afforded but led him to associate with composers of his time especially Henry Lawes. Milton senior's prosperity was delectated at providing his son with an eminent tutor, Thomas Young who was a Scottish Presbyterian from the University of St. Andrew's. Researchers are of opinion that Young may have influenced the tender Milton to religious radicalism that resulted him becoming a strong Protestant which made his devout Catholic father, Richard Milton disinherit him.
Let on his own, Milton attended St. Paul's School in London and studied Greek and Latin and most of the classical languages found in his poetry. Not second to his English poetry, he also wrote in Italian and Latin.
Milton attended Christ's College, Cambridge and graduated in 1629 and ranked fourth of 24 honour graduates. Obtaining his Masters of Arts in July, 1632, Milton stayed on to become an Anglicam priest. As shadows cast on coming events, this must have been a precedent to him having written the first datable compositions on two psalms at the age of 15 when he was at Long Bennigton.
Lady of Christ's College He came to be known as Lady of Christ because of his delicate fair complexion, grace and infinity when he was sixteen years old. As he matured, he was not happy being called by this term and quickly asked the church and call to refrain from it because of his loyalty and reverence to Mother Mary whom he adored.
'What slender youth, bedewed with liquid odours,
Courts thee on roses in some pleasant cave,
Pyrrha For whom bind'st thou
In wreaths thy golden hair,
Plain in thy neatness Oh, how oft shall he
On faith and changed gods complain, and seas
Rough with black winds and storms
Unwonted shall admire!
Who now enjoys thee credulous, all gold;
Who always vacant, always amiable,
Hopes thee, of flattering gales
Unmindful. Hapless they
To whom thou untried seem'st fiar ! Me, in my vowed
Picture, the sacred wall declares't have hung
My dank and dropping weeds
To the stern God of Sea.'
If I say Miltons work inspired and fired the imagination of William Wordsworth, no one will dispute. He had sweeping powers not only on writers but his followers and all those engaged in poetry and prose writing during his life time and continue to do so,
What made Milton the icon poet of England Many talent put together; his disposition, toward life , trust and faith in god, love for humanity, simplicity and the will to do the right thing.
Not lyrical at all, he shunned nature in writing but chose characters in people and places. Unlike Wordsworth, he appealed more to the serious reader, especially after the resounding success of PARADISE LOST , divided into several books. This masterpiece was followed by PARADISE REGAINED.
Book no.1 begins with Argument :-
This First Book propose, first in brief, the whole subject,-
Mans disobedience, and the loss thereupon of Paradise, wherein he was placed ; then touches the prime cause of his fall  the Serpent, or rather Satan in the Serpent; who, revolting from God, and drawing to his side many legions of Angels, was, by the command of God, driven out of Heaven, with all his crew, into the great Deep. Which action passed over, the Poem hastens into the midst of things ; presenting Satan , with his Angels, now fallen into Hell  described here not in the Center (for haven and earth may be supposed as yet not made , certainly not yet accursed ), but in a place of utter darkness, fitliest called Chaos. Here Satan, with his Angels lying on the burning lake, thunderstruck and astonished, ofter a certain space recovers, as from confusion; calls up him who, next in order and dignity, lay by him: they confer of their miserable fall. Satan awakens all his legions, who lay till then in the same manner confounded. They rise: their numbers: array of battle: their chief leaders named, according to the idols known afterwards in Canaan and the countries adjoining. To these Stan directs his speech; comforts them with hope yet of regaining Heaven; but tells them, lastly, of a new world and new kind of creature to be created, according to an ancient prophecy, or report, in Heaven-for that Angels were long before this visible creation was the opinion of many ancient Fathers. To find out the truth of this prophecy, and what to determine thereon, he refers to a fully council. What his associates thence attempt. Pandemonium, the palace of Stan rises, suddenly built out of the Deep; the infernal Peers there sit in council.
JOHN MILTON was born on 9 December 1608 in Bread Street, London into an effluent Roman Catholic family, was considered a man of letters and, English poet and a polemicist. An angry young man who defended the freedom of the press among many other atrocities. His condemnation of pre-publication censorship is among history's most influential defense of free speech.
Continues.
O' Nightingale that you bloomy spray
Warbl'st at eve, When all the wood are still
Thou with fresh hope the lovers' hearts dost fill
While the jolly hours lead on propitious May
Thy liquid notes that close the eye of day
First heard before the shallow cuckoo's bill,
Portend success in love, O, if Jove's will
Have linked that amorous power to try soft lay.

Kandy SC unconvincing in first outing
It is usually difficult to draw any conclusions from the result of the first game at any major tournament because it does not prove a true indication. Any way reigning league champions Kandy Sports Club did everything possible to beat CH & FC winning 23-6. Rugbywise It was a disappointing game for both teams. The Kandy fans who filled the stands in their numbers, expected a better performance, but they would have been much happier to see their club winning by a bigger margin. Last season in their opening game against CH & FC they scored a 96-0 victory.
The match ended as it began, with Kandy SC maintaining their favorites tag but had to toil to record this win. Kandy SC players under the leadership of Gayan Weeraratne entered the field with vigor and determination writ on their faces. The game's first points came within the first 34 minutes with a penalty. The second half was expected to be exciting but to the surprise of spectators it was once again sloppy rugby by both sides and the game ended in victory for the visitors who were searching for a try in what seemed to be a very long final minutes as the game was played in semi darkness. The match was called off seven minutes before the long whistle. In the last quarter of the game, few players forgot their rugby rules which resulted in unwanted brawls and two yellow cards shown by referee Dinka Peries to Mohammad Rifkhan of CH&FC and Heshan Silva of Kandy SC. There was a spectator who invaded the field wanting to sort out the brawl. Sad that the host team had not taken measures to stall spectators from invading the field which could have led to ugly incidents. Earlier in the second half of the game Nigel Ratwatte of Kandy SC who came in mid of the second half of play was the first player for the season to be shown a yellow card for a dangerous tackle.
The game started with the teams being introduced to the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, a keen rugby fan and whose son was captaining the host team. Seated next to the former President in the grand stand was Kandy Sports Club Trustee 'Mr. Rugby' Malik Samarawickrama, CH & FC president Shammi Silva and two Kandy SC committee members Mahesh Weerasinghe and Janaka Pathirana. Being the seasons opening game, Kandy should have been better attuned particularly as reigning champions and added strength and confidence to the team.
In the entire match, Kandy SC dominated possession and territorial advantage but failed to convert all this possession into points. However they are sure to do well in the rest of the matches. Although Kandy SC did improve on line-outs, as they knew they had to, winning there share and even stealing a two or three from the CH & FC, Kandy SC should certainly be looking to improve on ball handling in their next outing.
The Kandy SC recorded 10 ball handling errors, three of which came from the backs and rest by the forwards, the handling errors all seemed to come within CH & FC territory and stalled the Kandy SC from breaching the defence and scoring more points. Altogether, Kandy SC missed nearly seven scoring opportunities that came their way. The speed and strength of the CH & FC allowed them to keep continuous pressure on the Kandy SC side and, in the end, the defending champions didn't have enough juice left in the tank to motor to a more convincing victory.

Microsoft empowers Sri Lankas youth in digital era
The prevalence of internet connectivity, the ubiquity of mobile computing, and the disruptive change brought by social and multimedia have transformed the way we live, learn, and work.
This is especially true when it comes to education, which has great potential to benefit from the advantages of todays technology - both in transforming how students learn, and in preparing them to enter the workforce of the digital future. Educators have been facing pressure to digitalize their entire curriculum in the last decade. It has given rise to a steep learning curve, especially for accomplished teachers accustomed to more traditional approaches.
There are many teachers who would like to branch out more into digital learning. But they simply lack the technical experiences they need to feel confident and prepared to lead a classroom using technology. To make matters worse, it can be difficult for public schools to allocate funds to invest in technology, says Yashinka Alles, Education Lead for Microsoft Sri Lanka & Maldives.
To help local schools transform in Sri Lanka, Microsoft has partnered with the Western Provincial Department of Education, Headstart, Commercial Bank, and Dialog to launch Project Smart School. Its missiontransform the learning environment of a traditional secondary school into one that is smart and enabled by the latest technology. Since the programs launch in 2016, a total of 65 public schools from the Western Province have found ways to create a digital learning system. "The progress in technology adoption and change in instructional approach has been amazing," says Yashinka.
For example, at one public school - Gothami Balika Vidyalaya, Colombo - 87courses were created using the Learning Management System (LMS) provided by guru.lk, a software application integrated with Microsoft Office 365 that delivers educational courses and training programs.
As a result, the school now boasts approximately 55 courses that are taught using technology - daily. Further, at Bandaranayake College Gampaha, teachers in artistic subjects, such as drama and dancing, have also begun developing their own digital content and incorporating it into their curriculum. Since the launch of Project Smart School, more than 1,000 teachers have been trained by the program on the effective use of technology in teaching and learning. Of this group, those who went on to complete Microsofts Trainer Academy were further recognized as official Microsoft Innovative Educator (MIE) Trainers.
In Sri Lanka alone, Microsoft has recognized 300 teachers and 10 schools through the Microsoft Innovative Educator Experts (MIEE) and Microsoft Showcase Schools competitions, which were conducted alongside the Smart School Project. The recognized educators and schools will participate in the upcoming Bett Asia Leadership Summit on November 15-16, as well as at the Global Educator Exchange held by Microsoft in March 2018, where they will have the opportunity to engage with other innovative educators and learn about projects that have successfully integrated technology in the classrooms across the globe.
The winning schools for the Microsoft Showcase Schools competitions 2017: Bandaranayake Central College, Veyangoda; Bandaranayake College, Gampaha; Dhammananda Maha Vidayalaya, Moronthuduwa; Gothami Balika Vidyalaya, Colombo;
Mahinda Rajapaksa College, Homagama; and Taxila Central College, Horana. The most innovative teachers for the Microsoft Innovative Educator Experts (MIEE) 2017: Roshan Kumar from Bandaranayake Central College, Veyangoda; Anuradha Buddhika from Bandaranayake Central College, Veyangoda; Surani Maithripala from Gateway College. Today, Microsoft is announcing its plan to take Project Smart School a step further with the aim of incorporating technology into more public schools by the end of the year.
We believe that every child deserves a quality education where effective and creative learning can be delivered. Through our products, services, and programs, were working to empower educators through technology to transform the way students learn in the new digital economy, Yashinka concluded.

Nissan cuts operating profit  forecast after Japan recall
Japans Nissan has reduced its full-year profit forecast as a safety inspection scandal hit earnings. The carmaker expects operating profit of 645bn yen ($5.7bn; 4.3bn) for the year to March 2018, down from previous guidance of 685bn yen.
It also saw a sharp drop in operating profit for the three months to September owing to weakness in the US. It recalled 1.2 million cars in the domestic market last month after flaws in safety checks were discovered.
At a media briefing in Yokohama on Wednesday, Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa gave a long bow of apology and vowed to regain the trust in the wake of the scandal.
I would like to express my apologies to customers, business partners, dealers and all the people who have been supporting Nissan, he said.
Japans second-largest carmaker suspended local production for about three weeks after it revealed uncertified workers carried out final vehicle inspection checks for decades. On Wednesday, it resumed production at all six of its domestic assembly plants.

Parliament
Interim Report was only views of parties and people
The government could have explained earlier that the interim report of the steering report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms was not a draft of the Constitution but views of all parties and people made during 73 meetings, so that the public would not have been misled by politicians who sought petty political gains, said Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday.
He said that SLFP, TNA, JVP, Joint Opposition, etc., have submitted their views in it and they would again work together in the next step to bring about a new Constitution.
He made these observations yesterday, during the debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms which was held in the House of Parliament.
He said that he would not disagree power devolution within the limits specified in the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. He added that if power was to be divided going beyond the 13th Amendment, the country would be federal. He also said that the SLFP is of the opinion that the Executive Presidency should be maintained unchanged. He added that the General election system should also be changed.
"The foremost place given to Buddhism should not be changed," Minister Samarasinghe said.
"Buddhism had been our heritage for 2500 years and it should not be changed. The rights of those who follow other religions should also be preserved. The SLFP had already proposed an anti discrimination clause into the Constitution."
He also said that the unitary status of the country should not be changed.
Minister Samarasinghe who came up with this notion at the Constitutional Assembly, recalled that the Supreme Court had held that the 13th Amendment was in accordance with the Constitution only because it made provisions to appoint governors who could exercise the powers of the Executive President. The Minister also said that powers in the concurrent lists should be devolved to provincial councils. He also said that Chief Ministers in the North had failed to use the powers already given to them.
He came up with this argument by recalling that he as a provincial minister brought a statute to establish the Western Province Transport Authority and was first to issue a provincial gazette notification.
He said at one time North East Province Chief Minister Vartharajah Perumal had failed to take such decisions, but only declared Eelam.
"The Government had decided to meet the Maha Sangha and other religious leaders to explain matters to them," Minister Samarasinghe said.
"This is indeed a good move though it is a late decision. It is good to see Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe explaining the correct position of the government although it was somewhat late."
He also said that this is a very important juncture since all parties had got together to formulate this Constitution. He wanted to know the extent of the damage to the country's image due to the Black July of 1983. He said that presently we have been successful in reversing such damages.
He added that US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs in New York Thomas Shannon visited Sri Lanka and commended the country's endeavours. He added that the US Government had donated US$ 21 million and another war ship to the Sri Lanka Navy.
Welgama says he advocated for abolition of Executive Presidency
UPFA MP Kumara Welgama yesterday in Parliament, advocated for the abolition of the Executive Presidency, reiterating that the SLFP since the time of President J R Jayewardene, was against the Executive Presidency.
Welgama, who represents the Joint Opposition group, said he had always spoken against the Executive Presidency and would continue to do so.
Observing that President Maithripala Sirisena is also in favour of abolishing the Executive Presidency, the MP said that he would give his his fullest support to the President in this regard.
I spoke out my opinion on the Executive Presidency at a Central Committee meeting of the SLFP a couple of months ago. Several members stood against my opinion. Since then, I was not invited to the SLFP CC meetings. I am working as an electoral organizer for the SLFP for 35 years and also Vice President of the party. Democracy means the freedom of speech. When I started expressing my opinion, I was cut off from committee meetings, he complained.
The MP said he is in favour of a President similar to William Gopallawa or the President in India. After giving due powers to Provincial Councils, we could have a President with fewer powers, he added.
The MP also noted that foreign countries such as America, had shown more interest on a Constitution-making exercise in Sri Lanka, than the locals.
This was evident when an all-party representative group headed by the Speaker was in the USA. They focused only on two issues. Firstly, they objected to long term leasing of Hambantota Port to China and secondly they spoke about a new Constitution. They turned a blind eye to many other burning issues in the country, he remarked.
People have a right to change constitution if it affects countrys development: Ravi
The citizens of a country have the right and power to change the constitution of country provided the same affects the development of the country itself, said UNP Parliamentarian Ravi Karunanayake yesterday.
The government's attempt is to bring about a constitution formulated by ourselves under which the future generations could live together peacefully.
He made these observations yesterday, during the debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms which was held in the House of Parliament.
He also said that there was a dialogue in the country emphasizing the need for a new Constitution, changing the manner the country is governed and also the election system. He said the role played by Ven. Madaluwave Sobitha thera in leading such dialogues was commendable. He also said that as the people lived separated, the country experienced a three decade civil war.
"Owing to extremists, we have not been able to achieve peace in the country," MP Karunanayake said.
He said that during the past seven decades, we have led a pathetic life and this was the time to change everything. "We had lost many things during the past seventy years and the opportunities that we lost are also immense," MP Karunanayake said. " We should not let this situation continue to next generations."
He further said that we have to accept that the English language is important as an international language, but Sinhala and Tamil languages should be given priority.
He added that in addition to human rights being included in the Constitution, clauses on health, education and food should be included in the same. "We have to formulate national policies in that regard as well," MP Karunanayake said. "If there were such national policies on Education, students do not need to stage protests on various matters."
He said that we have to create a society where the people are treated equally and create Sri Lankans. "The people wish to develop the nation, but they are reluctant to change the Constitution," MP Karunanayake said. "If one constitution prevents the development process, we should be able to changes it."

Pathfinder participates at Vision for Shared Prosperity  in Indo-Pacific Region seminar in New Delhi
The United Service Institution of India (USI) under the directorship of Lieutenant General PK Singh organized its annual seminar on first week of November 2017 at New Delhi on the theme of, From Contest to Cooperation: A Vision for Shared Prosperity in the Indo-Pacific Region.
The seminar was aimed at bringing together varying perspectives on mapping of Blue Economy and its sustainable development, debate evolving security environment and its impact on peace and development and proposes measures for building viable collective economic and security architectures in a win  win paradigm.
General Dr. VK Singh, Minister of State for External affairs was the chief guest and delivered the key note address.
The minister highlighted the need to move from contest to cooperation for the progress of the region and strengthening regional forums and institutions to address the maritime security concerns in the Indian Ocean Region.
The term Blue Economy refers to a sustainable ocean based economic model that is largely dependent on coastal and marine ecosystems and resources. Harnessing of Blue Economy entails use of environmentally sound and innovative infrastructure, technologies, and practices including institutional and financing arrangements. Urbanization, pollution, over-exploitation, and climate change can be detrimental to the sustenance of a balanced coastal ecosystem.
There is a growing awareness in the world today that we need to be careful about exploiting the ocean based economy, as we cannot afford to damage the very ocean that is our lifeline. There is renewed understanding about the oceans as a key natural source for national as well as regional economies. This understanding has led to increased concern about ecological health and sustainability of oceans. This has compelled number of states to take measures to study the economic value of the oceans and to take measures to protect them.
The Indo-Pacific Region (IPR) combines Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. Multifaceted globalization has ensured that developments from the Suez Canal to the Sea of Japan or from African shores of the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific are strongly interrelated and mutually dependent. Owing to its overwhelming importance the IPR is termed as the Indo-Pacific Pivot. The region encompasses almost half of the world population, three of the ten largest economies, more than fifth of world GDP, 1/3 of world exports and half of the worlds maritime tonnage.
It is home to an enormously populous and diverse mix of ethnicities, cultures, political systems, religions, and economic models. The region is the maritime trade highway of the world and combines Southeast Asian states with the western Pacific, functioning as the throat of sea routes punctuated by Strait of Malacca, Sunda, Lombok and Makassar.
At least 40 per cent of the worlds sea borne trade, 50 percent of its container traffic and 70 percent of the traffic in hydrocarbon products transits through the region. Almost 68 percent of Indias, 80 percent of Chinas and 25 percent of the US oil is shipped through the IOR. Uninterrupted flow of oil, natural resources, and goods is extremely crucial for developing economies, like India and China. The IPR has huge potential for harnessing its Blue Economy.
The seminar focused on:
1.To cross-fertilize different perspectives on the security and economic challenges and cooperation clearly bringing out the convergences and divergences between various stake holders.
2.To develop a nuanced understanding of the existing and emerging economic and security architectures and examine their efficacy to boost strategic trust and foster cooperation.
3.To provide inputs to respective governments and institutions for review and reframing of policies and crafting strategic guidelines for bilateral / multi-lateral security, economic cooperation, and building bilateral trust.
4.To publish the proceedings of the seminar in the form of a book for wider dissemination to strategic community and academia
Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage presented a paper titled, Mapping the Potential of Blue Economy in the Indo-Pacific Region.
The ocean is the future of humankind. The humanity will increasingly depend on the ocean resources, not only as a medium of transportation and protein supply, but as an untapped resource pool as well.
The Blue Economy implies sustainable exploitation of living and non-living resources from the ocean. It is a sustainable economic model.
The Ocean has limitations in absorbing heat, pollutants and other hazardous materials, though it is considered as an absorber. There will be effects on marine ecosystems, if the health of oceans declines. The Indian Ocean Region is considered as a rich ocean area for hydrocarbons such as oil and gas, fish and sea grass and sea bed minerals.
However, the general health of the ocean is declining in the Indian Ocean as well. There is even a dead zone of 60000 square kilo meters in the Bay of Bengal. This is alarming. It has been observed the ocean is heating up 13% faster than early envisaged. When the surface on the ocean is warm and water content of the atmosphere above the ocean is high, it would result in extreme weather conditions such as cyclones, excessive rain and floods.
Main attributors for declining ocean health are human induced pollution and emitting of Carbon Dioxide.
This paper endeavored to understand the potential of living and non-living resources in the Indian Ocean and threats to sustenance of the same. Understanding of potential threats, which can sustain or hamper regeneration of ocean resources, especially from human-induced pollution is important in order to maintain a balanced economic model in the ocean.
Admiral Colombage made following recommendations for effective ocean management in the immediate future with a view to protect the health of oceans for long-term sustainable exploitation;
 Prevention and significantly reducing all kinds of marine pollution from all platforms at sea and specially from land-based activities including marine debris and nutrient pollution.
 Sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts. Take actions for restoration of the coastal areas and vegetation including mangroves in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans
 Minimize and address the impact of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels. Minimize dumping of industrial waste and other form of discharges to the ocean.
 Effectively regulate harvesting and overfishing, IIU fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans. Restore fish stocks to a level which can produce maximum sustainable yield.
n Ban selling of IUU fishing and compel markets not to sell those IUU products.
n Conservation of at least a certain percentage of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on available scientific information.
n Increase economic benefits to small island developing states and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism.
n Increases scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, in order to improve ocean and coastal health and to enhance contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries.
n Enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in UNCLOS, which provides legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources.

Perfect paut
Lipsticks have been a womans companion for ages. Adding a dash of colour to the visage or trendily coupled with your accessories, the product offers as many options as the brands coming in. Finding the right lipstick for your skin tone is easier than you think. Read on to find out more.
Lip colours and skin shades
Everyones skin has undertones of either yellow or pink. Yellow is warmer. Pink is cooler. Knowing your undertone is enormously helpful when youre trying to figure out which lipsticks look best on you.
A quick way to identify your skins undertone is to look at the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, and you also tend to gravitate towards wearing blues, whites, and grays, youve got pink undertones. If your veins appear more green, you have a warmer yellow undertone. If they appear to be both blue and green, you are the lucky owner of a neutral skin tone (meaning equal pink and yellow tones), and you can wear any colour.
Still unsure Hold a piece of gold jewelry and a piece of silver jewelry up to your face. Ignoring your personal preference, assess which looks better with your skin - cooler (pink) tones go better with silver jewelry, whereas warm (yellow) skin tones work better with gold.
To simplify the process, you can also stick to shades that typically suit olive, fair and darker skin tones.
Olive skin tones are generally neutral, so its hard for you to go wrong. Most nude, pink, orange, and red shades are going to look good on you.
The great thing about really fair skin is that bold reds and deep s can be worn. Avoid anything too light or with too much of a yellow undertone so you dont look washed out. Dark skin tones deep plum, berry red look fantastic. Avoid anything too light or pale on the lips. Deeper shades look more naturally flattering.
Lip balm before applying lipstick
It can be confusing to determine whether you should apply lip balm over or under lipstick. You have to apply a balm beneath the lipstick before application because lip balm protects your lips while moisturizing it.
Yellow teeth due to lipstick
Frosty pinky shades, corals, and matte formulas are the biggest culprits when it comes to dulling and even yellowing your smile. Yellow-based shades like coral are popular, but play up plaque on your teeth. Matte shades are equally trendy, but that dullness translates to your smile as well.
Choosing a red lipstick
From the silver screen to the catwalks of London Fashion Week, there is one beauty look that is always on trend: red lips! Worn by actresses including Helen Mirren, 71, and Susan Sarandon, 69, time and time again red lipstick is the trend of choice for the A-list on the red carpet. The main thing is to choose a shade that suits the shape of your lips. Many women are put off by bold lip colours because of the risk of colour bleeding around their mouth. This is especially the case for older women, when fine lines and wrinkles around the lip area are more common. You should use a clear lip liner to avoid this from happening. The trick to wearing red lip stick is with confidence without feeling clowny.
Avoid getting lipstick on ones teeth
Use this trick to ensure that your lipstick doesnt transfer to your smile. Form an O with your lips, put your index finger through the O, and slowly pull it out. Voil - all that pesky lip colour that was waiting to get on your teeth is now on your finger. Give your teeth a quick once-over so you know for sure that theyre smear-free.
Fading lipstick
Before you go over the first step, apply a little bit of foundation over your lips. Outline your lip first and then make sure to fill in your lips. Your end goal is to have lips that are totally covered in lip liner. Then you need to fill your lips with your lip stick.
Feathering lipstick
While outlining your lips is important when you want to prevent feathering, its not going to do anything to make your lipstick last longer. If you want a ruby red lip that will stick around for a few hours, you absolutely must cover your lips in lip liner first. Thats all there is to it. Simply grab a pencil and cover your lips with it.
Fuller lips
Use concealer to make your lips look fuller. This will make your lipstick go on closer to the colour in the tube, and make your lips look larger.Dab lip gloss in the middle of your lips.Using clear lip gloss or a shade close to your lipstick colour, apply a dab of gloss onto the middle of both of your lips. The shimmery product picks up light, making your pout look fuller.
Use a lip liner that matches your lipstick, and trace just slightly outside your natural lip line. Fill your lips in with lipstick, or just use the liner for your whole pout.Avoid dark lipstick. Rocking a nude or pale pink pout isnt just trendy. It will make your lips look naturally larger. Dark s flatten the appearance of your mouth.Invest in a lip-plumping product. Lip-plumping products come in many forms: glosses, balms, sticks, gels, and pots. Applying these to your lips can temporarily make your lips look fuller.
The plumping effect will only last for a couple of hours, but you can renew it by reapplying the product to your lips.
Dry lips
Replenish moisture in your lips. The most immediate way to bring relief is to apply a lip balm with ingredients that lock in moisture, like petroleum jelly (Vaseline). Other hydrating ingredients include beeswax and Shea butter. Avoid heavy matte lipsticks as these can dry out your lips.Exfoliate your lips. Stay hydrated. You can keep your lips plump and moisturized by drinking 8 to12 glasses of water a day.Protect your lips from the sun. Your lip balm or ointment should also include at least an SPF 30. Be sure to especially protect your bottom lip because it tends to be a little more exposed than your upper lip.
Brush your lips lightly with a toothbrush in a circular motion. This can remove dry flakes and improve circulation, which gives your lips a small boost and rosy .

SECOND DEATH ANNIVERSARY OF Ven. Sobitha Thera:
President says, his was not a one man show
President Maithripala Sirisena said that he has delegated powers to all unlike previous Presidents.
The President said the only thing that the former Presidents did not do was to distribute petrol at the fuel stations.
People are tearing me to pieces these days because of the petrol issue. Several former leaders were part of every decision that was taken and I cannot blame the public for criticising me for every single thing that goes wrong in the country, he said.
President Sirisena was addressing an event organised to commemorate the second death anniversary commemoration of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera at the Ape Gama in Battaramulla yesterday.
The President said that he is the one who is responsible even if a parent cannot get school admission for a child.
The government is accountable and has the responsibility to punish the wrongdoers. But we need everybodys support to do the right thing in the right manner, he said.
The President said: Prof. Sarath Wijesooriya said though the countrys Civil Society Organisations played a pivotal role in bringing the Good Governance regime to power, they are disappointed at the manner in which the government is conducting itself. President Sirisena said he fully endorsed the remarks made by Prof. Wijesooriya adding that if they (Prof. Weerasooriyas remarks) were put to a vote, he would raise both his hands to express his support.
I cannot speak everything openly but I would not disagree with Prof. Wijesooriya. We came to power by defeating the previous government to usher Good Governance. While criticizing others for their past conduct, we should also make sure that we are performing our tasks in a fair manner, he said.

## Title: Promoting openness in government Mayor of Seoul

Promoting openness in government Mayor of Seoul
Mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon is on his second term as Mayor of the Capital of South Korea; a city with a population of over 10 million and an annual city budget of 23 trillion Won (approximately USD 20 billion). In 2011, he introduced the concept of governance based on Communication, Cooperation and Participation to encourage greater participation of the citizenry in local governance and to make available administrative information of the city to the public.
As the President of Citynet; a regional network of local government authorities specializing in sustainable urban development, Park believed that cities play an important role in driving sustainable development and that in order to have the former, the city must first listen to its people.
A bottom-up approach is always more effective and sustainable, he said in an interview with the Daily News during the sessions of the 8th Citynet Congress held in Colombo this week.
Following are the excerpts of the interview:
Q. You were first a civil activist prior to becoming Mayor, was that transition challenging
A. It was different, the nature of activities was different but I think it is very important to have the participation of citizens in governance, which I always emphasized during my activism to the bureaucracy.
Q. Did you see instances where ideals had to give way to pragmatism when you were Mayor
A. I have always emphasized the practical mindset instead of abstract political propaganda. I thought that changing the lives of citizens in the real sense was most important.
Q. You have also encouraged communal programmes such as Seoul Sharing and an Energy Welfare Civic Fund. How did you introduce such concepts in a major city like Seoul which is driven more toward individualism and profit
A. Korean society traditionally has been community oriented. We have long kept the tradition of community; helping each other in times of crisis, poverty or invasion from other countries. But with economic development we lost this sense of community and it became individualized, personalized and led to the collapse of the community. With my election into office, I tried to bring the sense of community back into our society. Even during this short period, we can witness so many community organizations born within Seoul; many citizens organizing among themselves to do something for the community. I think it is very important to bring real change from the grass roots. Even if we have excellent policies, if you implement them top down, it will not be easy to bring in real change, but from bottom-up, change is very efficient.
Q. Critics have pointed out that in a city of almost over 10 million, it would take a lot of time to listen to everyone and policies often get delayed
A. There are problems in a city like Seoul. But we have no choice but to bring such bottom up approaches to institute fundamental change. And I think it is working. In the last six years, we could witness many changes which were brought about and the surge of community groups in many villages within the Seoul Metropolitan area, which has spread to other Metropolitan areas too.
Originally, the citizens were very thirsty to cooperate with each other to get things done or to make changes in their lives. So it was very timely for us to start the community movement and it was very natural.
Q. Now that we are in the era of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), coupled with the need to have increasing economic growth, as Mayor where do you think the line should be drawn. For example, would you agree with displacing communities to use their land for economic purposes
A. We had a period of rapid economic development in the past which was very successful but it also had serious consequences. The inequality, in the economic sense is being broadened and the conflict between the classes; between the poor and rich is getting worse. Plans of economic development, without social welfare protection for human beings will make it impossible to have sustainable economic growth. Since my election, I have emphasized that there needs to be more focus on human development such as social welfare, public health, and so on. In terms of climate change, I brought the initiative, One less Nuclear Power plan. Traditionally it was said that Nuclear power was more clean and efficient to provide power, but with the effects of the Fukushima disaster in Japan, we were given strong awareness of the danger of nuclear power plants. It is not easy to reduce energy use and produce renewable energy, but we had good governance with the citizens and it was easy to mobilize them and empower them. Within six years, we accomplished the reduction of CO2 emissions comparable to two nuclear power plants. It was actually about motivating the citizens to save energy and produce renewable energy. We had a system of accumulation where the citizens can save energy and receive some incentives or benefits. So more than 1.8 million citizens participated in the initiative and many towns were declared energy self- sufficient during the initiative. All these miracles were made possible due to the civic engagement and empowerment of the citizens.
Q. Usually, the role of the Local Government Authority is envisioned through the provision of basic facilities such as garbage collection, water, sewerage, etcbut have you seen your role as Mayor, going beyond that to want to engage with the citizens and to become a role model city to the world
A. The Central Government and nation sets the guidelines and the City Government and Municipalities, fill in the contents and implement the policies set by the Central Government. But I think the role of cities is becoming more important. When we first initiated the climate change systems in Rio over 20 years ago, the Central Government was the only player. But under the new climate change system agreed in Paris last year, the city governments role was given more emphasis so in this sense, I am the President of ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability), one of the three big associations for cities, and I am playing a great role in the climate change regime in Paris. A few months ago we held the conference on inclusive growth for Champion Mayors led by the OECD in Seoul. The idea was that overcoming inequality and bringing in inclusive growth cannot be done by the Central Government alone. The National Government is important, but the role of the City Government is also important.
Q. You have launched initiatives like the Digital Civic Mayors Office where you collect data on all aspects of the city. Have you been able to transfer this into policy or real change on the ground
A. Openness in government is very important. Transparency and accountability is the top most priority of the government. Transparency helps the government escape from corruption and adds efficiency. It is our principle to disclose all documents to the citizens, except when there are privacy or security concerns. So around 90 percent of all documents prepared by public servants are open. We have also developed all data and documents, assembled and gathered in a digital platform, so if you come to my office room, you will realize that I can understand everything that goes on in the city in real time, whether it be a disaster, fire, water supply issues, etc. Also I can send feedback to the person in charge. So it is very effective and transparent. Whether it is for big data, census, or IOT, this technology is the fourth industrial revolution. For the time being, this information is only for my use, but we are going to disclose and provide all the systems and knowledge to the citizens in future.
Q. Have you faced much resistance from the bureaucracy when opening up
A. Of course. The disadvantage of disclosing such information is that it is made available to journalists, so we can be a target of criticism. But I think this can be a medicine for our public servants because it can prevent more serious corruption from occurring. There was some reluctance at the start, but now we have agreed to the policy of transparency in our government.
Q. Mayor of Suwon during the Citynet sessions said that a Mayors role is to protect democracy and he highlighted that during the citizen protests against the former President in Seoul, you provided toilet facilities and free wifi to protesters who came to Seoul to protest every Saturday last year One would think that Local Government would suppress such protests, what made you stand up
A. An essential part of democracy is the freedom of expression. The right to demonstrate, should be respected and protected at all times. Seoul City Hall Plaza is a good place for assembly and demonstration. So every Saturday or Sunday there was a big demonstration. I think those demonstrations should be protected and guaranteed. We always have protests, one man demonstrations, etc, and sometimes it is against me. And they say that Mayor Park should leave. But I have asked my staff to provide them with a parasol for shade and water. It is an essential part of democracy.
Q. Do you not consider this as a threat to authority
A. Speaking out and the voice of citizens is very important. Even if it is wrong. Whether it is right or wrong can be judged by the citizens. I cannot judge, I have to hear the voice of every citizen. Of course I do not feel good when they criticize me, but it is my duty to hear their voice.
Q. South Korea is also facing an ageing population and you have the challenge of making the city inclusive for the ageing, how will you face this challenge
A. Crisis always can be an opportunity so we have a big population of baby boomers who are in their 50s and early 60s. And without intervention, they simply become the elderly. So we are providing new education to the baby boomers to prepare them for the coming age and to enjoy the second stage in their life. This could be helping them in start start-ups or social contributions, so we have started campuses for them so that they can learn how to prepare for the second stage of their lives.

Sharing the  Shakespearean flame
No matter what profession you practice, no matter what occupies you within the day, if you find that silent flame within their heart which lights the path to any form of art, you should kindle it further
Reliving the masterpieces of William Shakespeare the 16th century conqueror of English literature the Shakespeare Theater Festival 2017 is well prepared to bring out the essence of his works for Sri Lankan enthusiasts from December 11 to 18 at the Maradana Tower Hall Theater, Colombo 10.
The greatest Shakespearean productions  Macbeth (English and Sinhala productions), Othello (English and Sinhala productions) and Hamlet (Sinhala production) are planned to be unfolded as the director of the creations,Obinamuni Gamini De Silva celebrates 40 years of Shakespeare Theater life.
The festival also includes Shakespeare Challenge 2017 Award Ceremony with the categories: Drama, Quiz, Oratory, Translation and Essay. The best three plays of the competitions, selected from schools throughout Sri Lanka will also be performed.
De Silva is the initiator of The Shakespeare Center, Sri Lanka  a community which was created in order to encourage theater in Sri Lanka and to widen the knowledge of Shakespearean Theater Art and Literature.
We are a team which is bound to fulfill our duties and responsibilities for the Theater and we do so with discipline, said De Silva at the press conference which was held recently at the Institute of Sinhala Culture, Colombo 07. We try to bring the developed concepts of English literature into our own literature, said De Silva.
A silent but passionate mission
Killing oneself would be a better idea than practicing theater in this country, nowadays, said actor Sarath Dikkubura, who was also present at the event. And he proceeded to mention how, despite this fact, the Shakespeare Center carried out the very duty with no financial advantages.
"We contribute to Theater however we can and one of our main intentions is to spread Theater in education by welcoming young, talented students into our art. Our duty is not only to contribute to theater, but also to reveal the depth of art and literature to our future generations. Through the programmes we are planning for the future, we hope to do a well-meaning service to the Theater and through that, to the children of the country.
Actors under the skin
People from various professions contribute to theater because they like the essence they can add to the society through it, said Yajish Thennakoon, Attorney at Law. He has been a part of the Shakespeare Center community for two years. We are fortunate to be a part of this, he said.
Various professionals come together in this and have been able to attract global attention, De Silva confirmed. De Silva and his team were invited to stage their Othello English production at Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in Stratford-Upon-Avon  the town where Shakespeare was born  for the 400th Shakespeare Commemoration Theater Festival.
Shakespeare Center Sri Lanka was nominated by the United Nations Volunteers as Sri Lankas only voluntary institute for drama and is recognized by the International Theater Institute and Royal Shakespeare Company.
In addition, De Silva mentioned that the measures are underway to produce Othello in Tamil. He is also working on bringing Hamlet onto the silver screen by 2018. The team also produced the operatic Macbeth in 1992.
Shakespeare Drama Competitions were started in schools by Shakespeare Center in 1993 and have been carried out to this day. We show no mercy in our quizzes, said De Silva, convincing the thoroughness of the competitions. This was an attempt to situate theater activity and Shakespearean literary corners in the school curriculum. I consider it my duty to hand over this task to the next generation, he added.
The reason why Shakespeares creations have made it to the 21st century from the 16th is the subculture he brings out through his works, actor Jayalal Rohana said. The language Shakespeare uses in his literature is a blend of Latin and Persian. He has added more than 3,000 words to the English language. You could study one page of his works and write a book about it. Gamini De Silva does that very task in theatre form, Rohana added.
The Shakespeare Theater Festival 2017 is one such attempt in decades of service and this endeavor will go on, one step after the other, carrying eager artists forward with it. Tickets for the festival are now available at ''Sinhala Cultural Center'', Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 07.
To move forward, Rohana said, what you need is courage. Bear in your heart just enough unfailing courage, and you will go a long way in this deep, wonderful art, he said.
No matter what profession you practice, no matter what occupies you within the day, if you find that silent flame within their heart which lights the path to any form of art, you should kindle it further. If you see with the eyes of an artist, you should reserve time, will and strength to it and you should fuel that flame till it burns your soul.

Small group in govt. criticizing me for appointing Bond Commission: President
President Maithripala Sirisena said a small group in the government continuously criticised him for appointing a Presidential Commission to probe the Bond issue.
The President further said that those individuals had also spent money to run social media trolls that spread hate and insults against him.
If Ven. Sobitha Thera was alive, he would have backed me for appointing the Presidential commission, he said.
He was addressing the event organized to commemorate the second death anniversary of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, yesterday at the Ape Gama, in Battaramulla.
I can handle the criticisms from the Opposition, but the ones who are criticizing me within the government, are, in a way, acting against the principles of Ven. Sobitha Thera, he said.
The President said that there was a huge outcry from the public as well as civil society organizations to probe the fraud.
We were not appointed to fill our own pockets or to rob money. I did what I promised to the people, he said.
The President further said that Ven Sobitha Thera never had any political motives, he always tried to protect the rights of people in this country and added that the concept of common candidate originated in 1988 and finally it was the present government that made it a reality in 2015.
When I contested for the 2015 Presidential election as the common candidate, there were instances where stones were thrown, stages were set on fire and the state media used to the maximum to criticize us. But we overcame all those barriers and finally won the hearts of the people, he said.

Society must correct political culture distorted by former regime: Prof. Wijesooriya
The present society is struggling to correct the political culture distorted by the Rajapaksa regime, Professor Sarath Wijesooriya said yesterday.
Wijesooriya made these observations at an event held to commemorate the second death anniversary of Reverend Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera, which took place at Ape Gama, Battaramulla.
Professor Wijesooriya said that it is important to reflect as to why the majority of the country decided to defeat the Rajapaksa regime.
This is a question we should always go back to. It is equally important to consider the answer to this question. It is but a mere dream to build a proper governance without being sensitive to this answer, he said.
It is the responsibility of this government to build the world that Ven.Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera anticipated. His expectation was a country ruled by law. President and the Prime Minister of this government still have time to fulfill Ven. Sobhitha Theras wishes. We may not be able to voice these wishes the same way Ven. Sobhitha Thera did. But we must say that we will be completely dedicated to realize the political restructure his reverend wished for. Prof. Jayasooriya also said.
Our struggle against the political culture created by the Rajapaksas, should not be misread as an attempt to rebel against the present government.
It has been three decades since we started speaking about a new Constitution. The Abolishment of the Presidency, change of electoral system, power devolution, and reconciliation were not just the promises given by the Common Candidate at the 2015 election. Former President Rajapaksa also gave the same promises, Professor Jayasooriya further said.

Sponsors can help bring in more fans
Greetings islanders and here we are at the kickoff weekend of another intense rugby season ...a season that promises absolutely everything in the middle for the 80mins... and little room for players still trying to upgrade their fitness, both mentally and physically.
Matches: CH v Kandy, Havies v Police
Army v Navy, Air Force v CR
Two weeks ago we watched tradition ....step up ... with the captain's game ...the younger CR team, outlasting a new look CH team, full of names and hopes...looking to make their own history before Xmas.
Rugby fans will be licking their proverbial lips, anticipating huge impact stories both in Kandy and Colombo.
Questions burning holes in all experts portfolios...
1. Can Kandy defend their league title this season under Gayan Weeraratne
2. Will CR or Navy be dominant again after many moon
3. Is it Havelocks on the silverware this year ...big guns still a force perhaps
4. What's all the fuss and glam about a new look CH
Naturally I am not of pundit or expert origin ...rather a former player still mighty keen about our island game and more curious George about the level of conditioning....how strong the warrior and how good the mind under pressure
The season is, by definition, a massive stretch ...each game a real tester as Kandy discovered at the Racecourse against CH ...it's all on performance and effort on the day ...in the middle.
The battle upfront was unforgiving...the boilerhouse boys solid set, evenly shared by both front rows ...and it was only their ruck and maul game that outdid CH in the last quarter. Kandy are endowed with the luxury of Sri rep players from head to toe ...its hard to defend that level of quality ...especially their backs ...Roshan Weere at 9, Fazil M at 10, Gayan Weere and Danuska Ranjan at 12, 13, Ritchie D on the right wing and Williwara the left ...all runners, all finishers ...the entire national 7s Line to boot!
This is a nightmare lineup for all defence and counter attack plans ...give these boys any dirty ball under the most comprehensive drift plan...they will still punch major holes and hound goal lines with relentless efficiency.
It is difficult to anticipate many defence lines holding strong for all 80 minutes...so its just a matter of time before the lions and defending champions score.
Fundamentally, Havelocks or CR are probably likely to give threshold capital boys a run for their eco friendly money ...and round 1 presents some tantalizing possibilities... All sides are vulnerable under pressure. which means patience, both in attack and defence ...a great asset to have in possession.
Packweights will be key in the last quarter...as set play will be a much planned matter ...quite well handled by both set of 8s ...if anything the scrum half skills, our point of difference.
On that note, its absolute skill and efficient speed at 9, that will change all that ...the quality of Weeraratne and Sooriyabandara, a luxury to behold and shudders for those trying to close them down.
Coaches generally like to think their base is safe and all options in hand ...that gives them freedom to plan their attack and defence game ...in numbers and zones ...both 22m areas, their speed zones ...finishing being the elusive grail right from the kick off to the final whistle ...the coaching staff a little shy to dream too much especially if you are playing a superior Kandy, Havies, CR or Navy.
Weekend 1, panned out quietly but surely, very much according to plan ...with the predicted teams, pushing past to record fairly decent wins and some relief...
Kandy, Havelocks, CR, and Navy all shaping past to win game 1 and enjoy their socials ...if that assurance remains for week 2 is very different indeed, as the quality of opposition will change all the dynamicsand last weeks win and confidence ...merely a thought at the start of the new Dialog rugby league and nothing else.
Each weekend will carry a comprehensive set up and line up as a serious test, whatever the teams playing at home or away.
Traditionally all the forces team, by definition, carry superior fitness among their squads, in the first 4 weeks...call it Defence Services syndrome ...slightly in contrast to the club sides, still fighting rusty muscles and better breathing recovery in the weeks ahead this has its own sense of logic and tough for those analysts trying to make sense of the big teams current performance levels.
All considered ...professional club rugby is starting to upgrade their set up and the playing environment is certainly a far cry from 2 seasons ago.
The level of professionalism and player wellness, a bigger focus and a critical part of the transfer process this year.
Teams are counting the days in defined anticipation, as to when they get to reveal their new look lineup ...New captain's skills in leading hopes and ambitions out each weekend...but most of all the ever magnetic chance of winning the confrontation...some magical scores and greatest of all the execution of their game plan and substitute recycling ...that changed their eventual result ...assuring a decent W for the home team and their die hard supporters.
My parting thought to the entire rugby family of islanders...who will be adrenaline charged for their home team ...what can Dialog do with Sri Lanka rugby to make the match an unforgettable experience for all us fans, give us more interaction, and the opportunity to meet our stars in the middle A genuine fan zone, memorabilia, signed merchandise and match pictures autographed and available....this might pull in the numbers and finally see Colombo crowds match the enthusiasm and fanatical loyalty the Kandy boys enjoy and thrive on.
Aloha rugby fans ...let's get closer, understand the nature of this great game and enjoy the warriors this weekend.
It's only going to get more intense and more compelling...Cheers islanders.

The celebration was held at the prestigious China World Hotel.

Thailand begins talks on FTA with Sri Lanka
Thailand has started negotiations to enter into a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Sri Lanka, said Chulamanee Chartsuwan, Ambassador of Thailand to Sri Lanka addressing the Bilateral Trade between Sri Lanka and Thailand discussion yesterday at the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka.
She said Thailand plans to triple trade with Sri Lanka by 2020 from the US$5 million mark today.

The first phrase of this zone will be complete by 2018, she said.
The embassy plans to organize a tour of Thai businessman in July-August 2019 which will enable to promote more partnerships between SMEs of both countries. Chartsuwan also invited Sri Lankan businessman to register in trade fairs in Thailand so that they can use that registration as credentials to obtain visas.
The Thai Ambassador said Thailand was working on reforming the visa system. Sri Lanka businessman can now request for visas by sending an email request which they will facilitate one by one. There is also a possibility for Sri Lankan businessman to obtain six months and one year multiple visas. The Ambassador however cautioned that Sri Lanka should consider improving its Doing Business ranking which has further deteriorated from 110 last year to 111 this year. An improvement in the Doing Business ranking will be very conducive to the country, she said.

Thajudeen Murder case; CID to ascertain identity of suspicious persons
The CID yesterday informed court that they have initiated a comprehensive investigation to ascertain the identity of several suspicious persons in connection with the murder of former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen.
Filing a further report in Court, the CID informed Colombo Additional Magistrate Jayram Trotsky that it had deployed several investigative groups to examine the facts obtained from individual informants regarding the suspicious persons who involved in the incident.
The CID further informed Court that they have identified several suspicious telephone calls and sought the assistance of several government institutions including Department of Immigration and Emigration, Department of Registration of Persons and Department of Motor Traffic to ascertain their identity.
Meanwhile, acceding the prosecutions request, the Court issued an order directing the CIDs Forensic Investigation Unit that an analytical report pertaining to the Thajudeens mobile phone be handed over to the CIDs Gang Robbery Investigation Unit for further investigations.
Former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake,former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera and former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof.Ananda Samarasekara had been named as first,second and third suspects of this case respectively.
They were arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder and conspiring to commit the murder. They are currently out on bail.
However, third suspect Prof.Ananda Samarasekara was not present in Court yesterday. The Court was informed through his lawyers that Ananda Samarasekara is receiving treatment at a hospital.
While delivering the verdict, former Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris on February 25, 2016 ruled that the death appeared to be a murder and ordered the CID Director to immediately arrest all suspects involved in the incident and produce them before Courts.

The recipients will undertake Masters degrees at Australias top universities in a range of fields including public policy, international trade and development, human resource management, engineering management, clinical psychology and international business.
Australia is a leading provider of tertiary education, demonstrated by the increasing number of students studying there. Currently, there are 708,000 international students enrolled in Australian universities, up from 640,000 last year. This includes a growing number of Sri Lankan students, said High Commissioner Hutchesson.
High Commissioner Hutchesson reflected on the importance of education over the 70 years of bilateral relationship, which was celebrated this year.

Trump, first foreign leader to dine in Chinas Forbidden City
CHINA: Donald Trump will receive an honour in Beijing not granted to any US President since the founding of the Peoples Republic of China: official dinner inside the Forbidden City.
When Trump and his wife Melania joined President Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, for a tour of the Forbidden City, the historic palace that housed Chinese emperors and their families for almost 500 years.
Trump was expected to dine with Xi inside the Jianfu Palace, although the exact location of the dinner hasnt been confirmed.
The building dates back to the 18th century and was fully restored in 2005, making it one of the most well-preserved parts of the palace complex.
Wherever he dines in the Forbidden City, Trump becomes the first foreign leader to have an official dinner in the palace since the founding of the Peoples Republic in 1949.
Dining in the Forbidden City is a significant honour for Trump, in keeping with what Chinas Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai promised would be a state visit-plus.
The Chinese government knows who theyre dealing with, said Beijing-based historian Jeremiah Jenne. Its another in a long line of fairly shrewd moves by the Chinese government and something (Trump is) going to be very impressed with.
Originally constructed in the early 1400s, the Forbidden City is considered to be among the most important architectural and cultural monuments inside China. Designed to reflect the majesty of the emperor, the vast walled complex consists of over 90 palaces and courtyards of varying significance.
The site is currently undergoing major renovations, and areas previously not accessible to the public are being opened up.
Some of those spaces are incredibly opulent and done with a much greater level of detail than the (public areas), Jenne said. Im sure hes going to be in for quite a treat.
Ming Wang, a professor of government and politics at George Mason University, said the Chinese will give Trump an exceptional reception, essentially theyll try to make Trump happy -- that will work to Chinas advantage.
(Xis) going to treat Trump almost like an emperor, said Ming.
Using the Forbidden City in this manner is a dramatic shift from how the palace was viewed in the early decades of the Peoples Republic, the successor to the revolutionary government which overthrew the Qing Empire. What was once known as the palace of blood and tears is now being used for a state visit, Jenne said.
This is an example of how the narrative (within China) has shifted, particularly in the last 25 years, its no longer about emphasizing class revolution, in recent years its been much greater emphasis on the glories of Chinese civilization.
Trumps visit to Beijing comes on the back of successful trips to Tokyo and Seoul, where he was lavished with praise by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Moon Jae-in.
While both those leaders are key US allies, Trump will be facing a much more formidable task in China, where he will be hoping to get support from Xi for reigning in North Koreas nuclear and missile programs, as well as trade issues.
Ahead of leaving Seoul Wednesday, Trump tweeted he was very much looking forward to meeting with President Xi who is just off his great political victory, referring to the Chinese leaders shoring up of power at the 19th Communist Party Congress last month.
At a joint press conference with South Koreas Moon on Tuesday, Trump emphasised how important China was to the North Korea issue, saying Xi has been very helpful.

Word perfect!
Her talent rocked the Lionel Wendt theatre as the Workshop Players brought Lerner and Loewes Broadway classic My Fair Lady onto the stage. Hailing from a musical family 20 year old Amarsha Tissera never dreamt that she would give life to the iconic role which had been played by Audrey Hepburn in the timeless classic.
However this in not her first brush with a stage play. She has previously acted in Peter Pan in 2008, playing Wendys character when she was in her early teens. The play was directed and produced by Sharika Jayawardene for the Flying Solo School of Speech and Drama.
Since the play ran for 10 days, Amarsha shared Eliza Doolittles role with Daniella Perera. It was directed by Surein de S. Wijeratne and produced by Jerome L. de Silva. My Fair Lady is based on George Bernard Shaws Pygmalion, and is considered one of the finest musicals ever created.
I heard about the play last year. Initially I wasnt going to audition for the main lead. I was going to try my luck for the ensemble. However my Mum encouraged me to go for the lead. There were about 23 girls auditioning for Elizas role. I was the newbie in the crowd. I just walked in with a smile without any knowledge on how to take care of my voice even. I just could not believe it when I got the call informing me that I have got the role, Amarsha enthused.
She noted that she has grown up watching My Fair Lady with her sister since she was 7. She has been listening to Beethoven and Mozart from childhood because both her mother and grandmother were music teachers.
Both sides of my family either play a musical instrument or sing. No one has done drama per say, Amarsha expressed.
It was a lot easier being a Covent Garden girl because there is no need to act like a lady then. Being ladylike was the most difficult part of the project for me! You need to be so prim and proper and word perfect. The transition in which she was taught to utter certain words differently was the most fun part for me because it showed the audience that even a common flower girl could amount to something as beautiful as a duchess, Amarsha recalled some of her favourite scenes from My Fair Lady.
She said that the most challenging process during the week and a half in which the play ran involved taking care of her voice.
I used to simply drink hot water and taking part in a singing event. With My Fair Lady I learnt that you need to look after your voice 24 hours a day. This involved consuming bees honey and steaming to help clear the throat. You also need to drink coriander water and Paspanguwa daily. We had to drink two glasses of water as soon as we got up. Then a specific breakfast followed to give us energy. We were also advised to get adequate sleep. Since I was not use to such a schedule I found it very difficult to follow, the bubbly youth giggled adding that it was this change of lifestyle rather than the acting which was a trail to her.
She notes that the most important advice that Surein has given her was not to react to missing a lyric. Just keep going because the show must go on.
Working with Jerome was memorable because he was back on stage after five or six years. The entire experience was simply magical for me, she beamed.
Amarsha Tissera.Pictures by Ruwan de Silva
A past pupil of St Bridgets Convent and Lyceum College, Waththala, Amarsha has been involved with drama from grade six. Firstly she starred as Portias clerk in Merchant of Venice. Driven by a passion for acting in stage plays she began taking part in the school productions annually.
We did My Fair Lady during the last year I was at school. I played Elizas character there too. Therefore the lines were very familiar during the Workshop Payers rehearsals, she said.
Music runs in the family. Amarshas mother, Anusha Tissera, plays and teaches the piano. Her father, Trajan Tissera, is attached to Lanka Aluminum Industries PLC. Her sister, Tehani, plays the violin. Amarsha plays the cello and the piano. She had learnt to play the cello since she was seven and completed grades 1 to 8 with the ABRSM and Trinity College of London. She has trained under her mother and Tamara Holsinger. Amarsha has completed grades 1 to 8 in piano with the Associated Board of the Royal School of Music (ABRSM) and holds a A.T.C.L from the Trinity College of London. She has learnt to play the piano from her mother and Ramya De Livera Perera. She has completed Grade 8 ABRSM in singing, under Naomi Gooneratnes guidance. She has completed grades 1 to 8 and holds an A.T.C.L. from the Trinity College of London for speech and drama and was trained by Sharika Jayawardene and Tamara Holsinger. She also sings with the past Bridgteens Choir Contempo.
Amarsha is currently in the third year of her LLB degree. She aspired to study law from childhood but after her stint in the spotlight on stage she is considering studying theater as well.
She says that sacrifices are evident if you want to excel in the scene.
It is difficult if you cannot be flexible. If you are in a play you have to give your 100 percent. You need to be there mentally and emotionally to take on the role. Many of the Workshop Players had professional commitments too while they took part in the production. Luckily I had the opportunity to stay away from lectures because I was not missing out much, she said.
She says that she owes all that she is today to God, her family and her teachers because it is their confidence, their support and their love that has brought her to this point in her life thus far. Amarsha is also grateful to the Workshop Players for giving her an opportunity of a lifetime and welcoming her into the workshop family.
Her message to the youth is, I think fear; is one prevalent factor, fear of rejection, the fear of not being good enough, that holds back individuals from achieving their potential or to even take that leap of faith, to believe that they can do anything they set their minds to. I, too, was very nervous to audition for the role of Eliza Doolittle. But one bit of advice my mother instilled in my sister and I - if you dont try, you will never know. Life is all about taking risks and trying. Dont ever leave room for regret and end up living a life of what-ifs. The world is full of endless possibilities and they are within your reach. Dont hide in your box and throw your God-given talents away all because youre afraid to take that leap of faith. Nothing is impossible until you make it be. All you need is 20 seconds of insane courage.

Yemen conflict: UN official warns of world's biggest famine

Yemen faces the world's largest famine in decades "with millions of victims" if aid deliveries are not resumed, a senior UN official has warned.
Mark Lowcock, the UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, urged the Saudi-led coalition to lift its blockade of the conflict-torn country.
On Monday, the coalition shut air, land and sea routes into Yemen after Houthi rebels fired a missile at Riyadh.
The ballistic warhead was intercepted near the Saudi capital.
Saudi Arabia said the blockade was needed to stop Iran sending weapons to the rebels.
Iran denies arming the rebels, who have fought the Saudi-led coalition since 2015.
Lowcock was speaking on Wednesday, after briefing the UN Security Council on the issue behind closed doors.
"I have told the council that unless those measures are lifted... there will be a famine in Yemen", Lowcock told reporters.
"It will be the largest famine the world has seen for many decades with millions of victims."
Earlier this week, the UN and the Red Cross warned that a "catastrophic" situation threatened millions of Yemenis who relied on life-saving aid deliveries.
The Red Cross said its shipment of chlorine tablets, vital to combating a cholera epidemic which has affected more than 900,000 people, had been blocked.
The UN says seven million Yemenis are on the brink of famine.
The country relies on imports for virtually everything civilians need to survive, but now neither food, fuel nor medicine can get in.
More than 8,670 people - 60% of them civilians - have been killed and 49,960 injured in air strikes and fighting on the ground since the coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in March 2015, according to the UN.
