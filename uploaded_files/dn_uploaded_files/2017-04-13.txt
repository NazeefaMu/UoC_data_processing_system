Avurudu thoughts
The Sun has been so pivotal to our ancient civilization that we still continue many of the practices that our ancestors engaged in, giving prominence to the life-giving Sun and Nature. Many of those practices and beliefs were intertwined with astrology. Hence, the transition of the Sun from Pisces (Meena) to Aries (Mesha) has become a major celebration in Sri Lanka over the centuries.
The Sinhala and Hindu New Year that dawns tomorrow is an opportunity to reaffirm our bonds with each other and with Nature itself. Avurudu, (the more popular vernacular term) is celebrated in many other Asian countries under different names. It is a joyous national event that brings all Sri Lankans, here and abroad, together.
Although primarily celebrated by Sinhala Buddhists and Tamil Hindus, Avurudu celebrations see the active participation of all communities and religious groups. Avurudu is the perfect time to shed all differences  ethnic, religious and political  and support endeavours to establish lasting peace in our island. Such ethnic and religious unity is the need of the hour, especially when certain chauvinist forces opposed to the peaceful co-existence of various communities are working overtime to re-ignite the flames of hatred. People have however rejected their overtly racist political campaigns.
Unity and peace will be key themes for the Sinhala and Hindu New Year. Peace should begin in our hearts and in our homes. This is the lesson that Avurudu teaches us. It is a time for forgetting all past disputes and for giving and forgiving. It is a time for re-engaging in cultural traditions that we have nearly forgotten. Avurudu makes us admire and cherish our age-old moral values that centred on the village-temple-school axis.
Avurudu is perhaps the only event that motivates the entire populace, from Point Pedro to Dondra Head, to sit down for a meal at the same time and begin work at the same time. Many Sri Lankans living abroad also follow these auspicious times. Avurudu teaches us the value of togetherness, respect, forgiveness, punctuality, peace and co-existence. These are timeless traditions that we have inherited from our forefathers, ones we should in turn perpetuate for posterity.
Avurudu is a time for renewing bonds within families and among relatives. It is not unusual or families and relatives to be at loggerheads over various matters, but there is no point in continuing such hatred. We should forget such animosities that give rise to hatred and radiate compassion instead. Engaging in religious observances during the Nonagatha (Literally no auspicious times) period brings religion closer to our lives which are veering alarmingly away from moral values.
The Avurudu tradition of worshipping our elders and seeking their blessings through the anointing of oil reminds us of the need to honour and care for our parents and elders at a time when they are neglected in many societies. Ganu Denu (transactions) goes beyond the literal monetary meaning of the concept of give and take  that sharing and caring should be an integral part of our lives.
One can dismiss auspicious times (Nekaths) and Avurudu traditions as archaic beliefs that do not belong in the modern digital era, but they are rituals that still bind our society together and give us time to take a short break from the rat-race lifestyle. Not many modern families sit down for at least one meal every day instead of being glued to the TV. The screen has taken over from conversation. That is a result of commercialism taking over our lives at the expense of family bonds and traditions.
Commercialism has also crept into all national and religious festivals. Judging by newspaper and television advertisements, Avurudu has become a big shopping and entertainment season with its core values and message facing the danger of being swept aside in this torrent of commercialism. This should not be the case. We should see through the commercial veneer into the real purpose of national events such as Sinhala and Hindu New Year.
Every New Year ritual has a meaning and purpose. They prepare us for a fresh New Year filled with fresh resolutions. The main resolution that we should see through collectively as a nation is achieving reconciliation. This is a time to reflect collectively on why and where we have gone wrong during the past and on how we could put things right at this juncture. Avurudu is not only an ideal opportunity for peace and reconciliation at home and in the village, but also in the country as a whole.
The Nation has entered a decisive phase of seeking lasting peace and reconciliation following a brutal conflict. The lawmakers have been busy drafting a new Constitution that is likely to address the concerns of all communities and religious groups in the country. The Sinhala and Hindu New Year could be a unifying factor in creating a new Sri Lanka and a Sri Lankan identity. That is one New Year resolution that we should uphold and strive to turn into reality in the coming year.

Avurudu: Wheeling on with time
Among all festive seasons of Sri Lanka, the Avurudu must be the one that is least capable of flying under the radar. Awash goes the countrys media apparatus with experts offering descriptions, mostly unoriginal, about the history and other aspects of the ceremony. Another school takes a different path to question and pass judgement on the ceremony for its increasing commercial faade. That school is a minority, constituted mostly by the youths. Questioning is admirable and sometimes looks quite an exceptional option.
But does questioning alone do justice Questioning the validity of Sinhala Tamil New Year, in a way, shows ignorance of the bigger picture. When we question, we indirectly think we are unconventional thinkers. This indirectly makes us happy. Before questioning, we must reflect the bigger picture.
Probably why the rest of us opt to tag along the festive spirit: the Sinhala and Tamil New Year.
A day or two of friendship
Like in any other community, the Sinhala Tamil New Year exists to unite people of different backgrounds and ideologies. A festival of such a category is essential for humankinds survival. Naturally, a man is pushed towards negative traits such as wrath and hatred. These traits continue to pervade most human relationships throughout the year. The festival has a potential to outweigh these negative traits by freshening and smoothening relationships.
The soaps have often shown how wrathful families finally make amends. The trend or customs may sound boring, as it rolls on every year without much difference. But the human race needs such festivities for its own survival. A day or two of friendship is much more worth than a whole year spent in wrath.
Amid all hardships, man would finally reap his harvest. That usually happens once a year. That certainly deserves celebration. Festivities are born to celebrate harvests. The New Year, despite whatever changes take place, may continue to grow. The festival depends on the usual routine of its followers. Sri Lanka's evolution of the New Year offers a good example.
Sri Lanka was preliminary  and continues to be, to a lesser extent - an agricultural country. So the New Year customs were mostly based on agrarian society. But with the British arrival, the society experienced many upheavals. The New Year in the same vein faced a cultural change. Like anything, it too has to face evolution.
What is the better New Year No one has the right to judge. The New Year serves its purpose as the society wheels on with times. Many argue that the New Year has become a trader's festival  commercialised, more sophisticated in phrasing. Not only such phenomenon is inevitable, but it is also a part of the deal that is evolution.
The society's needs have grown far beyond than it was a few decades ago. There are certain points where it exceeds beyond the tolerable level. The government had to increase taxes on cars, especially the best-selling Indian brands, as the traffic congestion was getting worse. When buying rate goes high, even beyond a tolerable point, it takes a toll on the whole social system. The rulers have to hold against such currents.
Evolution is what everything has to undergo. Festivals and ceremonies are no exceptions.
In times of yore, the custom was to drop a one-cent coin to the well. It bore many messages. The well used to be one source of income. The residents used water to vegetation as well as their own purpose. But things are different now. The well is becoming an antique item in the urbanity.
A well could be dug in the garden to keep up with the tradition. For some, this may be a joke. For some, this may be a good symbolic gesture to keep with the tradition. For some, this may just be ridiculous.
To dig the well or not, that is not the question. The question is if we should accept and come to terms with evolution.
With evolution, customs have to change. This metamorphosis has quite a few words: globalisation, modernization and urbanisation are beautiful words.
We had no other source of water. So we had to keep well in reverence. The well was an important element, hence it had related customs. Now with the pipelines flowing down beneath us, do we still have to adhere to that particular custom It doesn't mean we must cease respecting the ancient water systems. But we too have to move on.
Keep up with the tradition
This is one example. When these customs cease, the questions and criticism emerge. The New Year is losing its glamour, some can easily opine. These opinions matter, and are relevant. The festivities may lose their glamour. But who can expect glamour to continue every year without any difference Seasons change. New discoveries unfold. If these come to pass, how can only the festivities remain undisturbed The New Year has truly become the trader festival, one may say, as they are the category most benefited by the occasion. Saying so doesn't mean we must reverse the situation. We simply cannot do that. We cannot reverse the grown up human necessities. Our era is technologically advanced. But that does not matter.
Many doubts have started surfacing.
This is merely one period we are passing. Many more things have occurred, and are about to occur. With many arguments and questions drifting through, what is left for us is to keep up with the tradition that evolves with time.
As we roam among a techno-savvy crowd, the real Avurudu is gradually becoming a vintage festival. Ergo, in a centurys time, this very same Avurudu might not be able to retain the civil eminence it is privileged with now. It will be left inscribed in the vulnerable sands of history as a good old antique festival.

Battle of wits
The SAITM issue is by no means over. The government is likely to go ahead with gazetting minimum requirements and then seeking court approval to implement them. Whether the GMOA will still stick to its guns at that stage remains to be seen, but this is a battle of wits that is likely to continue for many months to come. Meanwhile, patients at state hospitals will bear the brunt of the actions of the GMOA, whether they like it or not.
The crisis over the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) appears to be heading for a confrontation between the government and the major doctors trade union, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) while opposition political parties are keen to get maximum political mileage out of the issue.
Late last week, the GMOA staged a crippling one day countrywide strike in state hospitals. It was reported that its doctors also kept away from private practice that day. That the trade union, which claims it is fighting to protect the lives of innocent patients did so at a time when the country is battling dengue and influenza epidemics, attracted much criticism and casts doubts on their integrity.
By early this week, the Ministry of Higher Education announced a series of proposals aimed at resolving the issue. It included the takeover of the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital in Malabe which will now be run as a teaching hospital under the Ministry of Health. The government envisages that this would provide adequate numbers of patients for the clinical training of SAITM students.
In addition, several other measures were announced. The provision of additional clinical training at the Homagama and Avissawella hospitals, a mandatory examination conducted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) for students qualifying from private medical schools and the stipulation of minimum standards for medical education are among them.
Court of Appeal decision
The government was cautious to announce that these measures will be subject to any decision arrived at by the courts. It will be recalled that it was the Court of Appeal decision in late January this year that opened the floodgates for protests against SAITM.
That was after the Court of Appeal announced that SAITM students were entitled to have their degree registered with the SLMC. Since then, the SLMC has lodged an appeal in the Supreme Court against the decision by the Court of Appeal.
Legal experts say that while this has given some time for the SLMC to review its stance, the Court of Appeal verdict is extremely sound in law and is based on the strict interpretation of the Medical Ordinance and the Universities Act, as they stand now.
The government hopes that the measures announced earlier this week will provide the basis for a resolution of the SAITM crisis which is beginning to have its impact. Already, students of all state medical faculties are boycotting lectures. As a result, their final examinations will be delayed. This would necessarily mean that the graduation of the next batch of doctors from state medical schools will be delayed- and there wont be a batch of new doctors available to take over when the current batch of interns end their one year of internship.
However, the GMOA appears to have pooh-poohed the governments proposals and dismissed them prematurely. Its intentions were made clear when their spokesmen jumped the gun and stated that gazetting of minimum standards for medical education would only aggravate the crisis- even before the minimum standards had been announced!
In fact, it was the Court of Appeal which, in its judgement which noted that at present, there are no minimum standards for medical education, which could be considered to be legally binding. Only weeks ago, the GMOA was agitating for these standards to be announced. Now however, they have done an about-turn and are challenging the declaration of such standards, even before they have been officially revealed!
It is understood that these standards are now being prepared by the SLMC. They will cover the minimum Advanced Level qualifications for students studying Medicine as well as other issues including facilities for teaching such as lecture halls and library facilities, the cadre of the lecturers and professors, the number of beds and other facilities available for clinical training.
Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital
It is learnt that SAITM will meet most of these standards, once the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital is taken over by the government. However, it has already declared that some of its students may have only three simple passes at the Advanced Level examination instead of the two credits and one simple pass which is likely to be the stipulation of the SLMC.
SAITM has pointed out that the SLMC announced its requirements only in 2011. Until then, SAITM had enrolled some students with three simple passes but since then all its students fall within the SLMC requirements, SAITM has said. No doubt, these claims will be subjected to the most rigorous scrutiny by the government, the courts of law and of course, by those opposed to SAITM.
Another potentially problematic issue is the minimum requirements of staff in medical schools. It is well known that some state run medical faculties- most notably the Rajarata, Eastern and Jaffna medical schools- lack adequate permanent staff. The question as to why the GMOA and the SLMC does not raise this, if they are indeed genuinely concerned with the standard of medical education has already been asked, but this will come to the fore when minimum standards are gazetted into law.
Demand for closure of SAITM
The current stance of the GMOA, in the wake of the government announcing what many would consider a reasonable solution, is puzzling if one considers it to be a merely professional trade union fighting for its rights. However, there are now indications that the GMOA, instead of securing standards for its profession, is keen on brow beating the government politically.
Its President, Anurudhdha Padeniyas speech at the culmination of last Fridays protest was a case in point. It appeared to be extremely political and described Leader of the House and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne as amanayo or fools.
Padeniya was also treading on dangerous ground when he asked, What is the point of having courts when it cannot deliver proper judgements Many interpreted this to be a reference to the Court of Appeal decision that was in favour of SAITM and that Padeniya could in fact be cited for potential contempt of court.
The GMOAs current demand is for the closure of SAITM and for the institution to be nationalised. They want history to repeat itself because protests against Sri Lankas first privately managed medical college, the North Colombo Medical College (NCMC) in Ragama saw it being nationalised at the height of the insurrection launched by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) by then President Ranasinghe Premadasa and affiliated to the University of Kelaniya as its medical faculty.
Indeed, the JVP- as well as the Joint Opposition (JO) - has joined the GMOA in its current agitation against SAITM. That is not surprising because that is what opposition political parties do: they join campaigns that are directed against the government.
Nevertheless, the JO will find itself in quite embarrassing situations if it actively takes up cudgels against SAITM. That is because SAITM was conceived and launched during the tenure of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Not only did Rajapaksa encourage SAITM, he also conferred scholarships to deserving students who entered SAITM. Given this background, how the JO now defends its anti-SAITM stance would be interesting.
For the government though, although the SAITM issue has the potential to become an enormous challenge, it is also about one of policy. That is whether it endorses private medical education in Sri Lanka or not. Sri Lankas first experiment with private medical education, the NCMC, fell victim to the political circumstances of that era. The government does not want that to happen again.
The best way forward for the government is to work with the SLMC and the state medical faculties to formulate a series of stringent guidelines that will allow private medical education but at the same time ensure a series of checks and balances that prevents medical education being devalued and exploited on a commercial scale.
Given the current strained relationship between the government and the GMOA, with the GMOA pursuing its own political agenda, the government is unlikely to get the support of the doctors trade union. However, this may not have a major impact as the actions of the GMOA are now increasingly being seen by the public to be self-serving rather than altruistic.
The SAITM issue is by no means over. The government is likely to go ahead with gazetting minimum requirements and then seeking court approval to implement them. Whether the GMOA will still stick to its guns at that stage remains to be seen, but this is a battle of wits that is likely to continue for many months to come. Meanwhile, patients at state hospitals will bear the brunt of the actions of the GMOA, whether they like it or not.

Thank you Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka
I am delighted to send this letter to Daily News in great appreciation of the aforementioned Ministers kind thought which prompted him to cause action to ease the terrific traffic congestion at Rajagiriya, between Rajagiriya Junction and Ayurveda Hospital, specially in the mornings.
I am a daily traveller from Welikada to Kollupitiya in No 177 Kaduwela-Kollupitiya bus. Earlier, invariably in the mornings, buses plying from Kaduwela to Kollupitiya took about more than half an hour to pass this short distance.
Minister Patali Champika thank you very much. Now owing to your efforts it takes even less than 10 minutes to across this vulnerable point.No one dreamt of such a smooth vehicle movement plan in the said area earlier.
The entire travelling public in this area will appreciate your kind gesture indeed.

Dengue Type 2 strain: Unfamiliar menace
Officials from the Dengue Control Unit are blaming the current dengue outbreak on the appearance of the type 2 dengue virus, which has newly arrived in the country.
From 2009 until 2016, dengue virus types 1 and 4 were circulating in Sri Lanka. But in 2016, the type 2 virus appeared, which is a virulent strain. Our population is not immune to this variety of dengue, and that is why we are getting many more cases than usual, said Dengue Control Unit Consultant Community Physician Dr. Preshila Samaraweera.

Sources from the Ministry of Health, Nutrition, and Indigenous Medicine also told the Daily News that the number of dengue cases is on the rise in the country and that the disease will likely cause more deaths in 2017 than it did last year.
This news comes alongside reports of overcrowding at various hospitals throughout the island, as some patients are sharing beds, while others are receiving treatment while seated in chairs or lying on the floor. The overcrowding at the hospital where I work is getting more and more serious due to the dengue and flu outbreaks. There are often two people to a bed, and sometimes, still others sleeping on the floor. Despite these difficulties, I can say that we continue to deliver high quality care, said a physician from a private hospital who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The rising numbers are causing concern in the medical and public health communities, as the country is on pace to have twice as many dengue cases than it did last year.
The first three months of 2017 saw 27,898 cases and 53 deaths, while there were just 55,150 cases and 90 deaths over the course of last year. Public health officials have also blamed irregular weather patterns on the increased prevalence of dengue.Part of the problem is the unusual rain pattern that we are experiencing. Usually there are two peak dengue seasons: June through July and then November through January. But this year, we had increased cases in February and March because the monsoonal rains did not come as expected, said Public Health Department Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Ruwan Wijayamuni.
The rains have come every few days with heat increase in between the rains, and these conditions are ideal for mosquito breeding, he added.
Various other South and Southeast Asian countries, such as India, Malaysia, and Singapore are also experiencing large dengue outbreaks that are testing public health and medical services.
This year, there are more cases than there have been in the past. Because of the increase in cases, there are more patients who are dying, and the public gets alarmed when people die. The healthcare system is effectively treating people, but having some patients die is inevitable, said an official from the Ministry of Health who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The official added that most hospitals have the proper facilities to deal with the outbreak, but that there are some that are understaffed and lack the proper equipment, especially in the remote and poor reaches of the island. Some hospitals in rural areas lack the resources to treat people suffering from dengue, and we are working to get people with severe cases to better-equipped facilities located nearby.
We are doing all we can, and of course we wish we could do more to fight back against the disease, but the hospitals are geared to handle the current outbreak, the official said.
The Dengue Control Unit and Public Health Department are stepping up mosquito fogging, surveillance, and container removal programmes to combat the surge in cases. My team recently inspected 11,800 houses in the Colombo area, and we found potential breeding sites in 12 percent of those houses. We would like to see that number at five percent or less, said Wijayamuni.
He added that it is finally up to the public to take action since his organization does not have the personnel to monitor the entire city. That being said, Wijayamuni noted that he started carrying out indoor mosquito fogging between 5:30 and 7:30 am, since that is when mosquitoes search for food.
Officials also bemoaned the fact that many people lack the knowledge of how to effectively limit their exposure to mosquitoes and remove breeding sites.
We are ramping up awareness campaigns, both through the dengue control unit and the media, to teach the public how to identify and destroy the containers, used tires, and plastic cups that mosquitoes use to reproduce, said Samaraweera.
Officials are confident, however, that they will be able to contain the current outbreak.

Dos and donts when lighting crackers
Adults should not have hand contact when lighting firecrackers while children should not be allowed to light fire crackers at all, National Training Officer of the Colombo National Hospital Accident Ward Pushpa Ramyani De Zoysa said.
Adults should light firecrackers and make a dash for it and they should not go back and examine if there are any unlit firecrackers, De Zoysa said.
They should not light fire crackers under the influence of liquor, she said.
According to Zoysa, a fire crackers should not be more than two inches long and the fuse should not be shorter than two and half inches. The firecracker should be cylinder shaped. They are usually packed in their hundreds in one big packet. Other firecrackers are not safe. They are similar to bombs and sometimes people die or lose body parts by lighting them.
The firecrackers should not be dropped from high rise buildings. They should not be thrown over walls, into gardens etc. If anyone gets burnt while lightning firecrackers, they should wash the injury with clean cold water for at least 20 minutes and if an eye gets burnt, it should be watered continuously until the victim reaches the Eye Hospital, she said.

Easter Messages: Jesus supreme sacrifice remembered forever: President
The unparalleled supreme sacrifice made by Jesus Christ to save the human beings who are born in sadness and experience sadness throughout life, will be remembered forever, stated President Maithripala Sirisena in a message marking Easter.
The message added: The Christian devotees who celebrate the Easter with great devotion demonstrate that incomparable supreme sacrifice was made in order to rise above the humans and achieve divinity.
When Jesus Christ saved the human mind from sin, the entire mankind was blessed forever. Jesus Christ, who was magnanimously selfless even to sacrifice his own life for the sake of fellow human beings, thus gave an example for humankind to understand that the divine love is eternal. He demonstrated the truth that somebody can be destroyed but cannot be defeated.
The supreme sacrifice of Jesus Christ is celebrated by the Christian devotees all over the world to enlighten the hearts of the people about the most prominent selfless act that marked the existence of the world today.
The love which makes the human mind soften with kindness is a gift from God transferred through the Easter. I wish that Easter will bring divine blessing for all Christian devotees.
Cross was a challenge to political, religious hierarchy: PM
The Cross was a challenge to the political and the religious hierarchy of the day and it continues to challenge Christians to herald in change in keeping with the doctrine Christ preached - that of love compassion and forgiveness, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe sending a message marking Easter.
The full text follows: Jesus Christ was and is one of the greatest teachers of history, whose message of love and compassion has touched hearts and transformed lives of people throughout the ages.
The Cross was a challenge to the political and the religious hierarchy of the day; the Cross continues to challenge Christians to herald in change in keeping with the doctrine Christ preached - that of love, compassion and forgiveness. The season of Lent teaches them the meaning of sacrificial love that was so poignantly depicted in the life of Christ.Christians observe Good Friday at the foot of the Cross and rejoice in the resurrection of Christ on Easter Day - symbolising the victory of justice, mercy and forgiveness that form the foundation of selfless living Christ preached.
May Christians everywhere truly experience the joy of resurrection and love for fellow mankind this Easter. A blessed Easter to all!
Celebration of hope: Sampanthan
Easter marks a celebration of hope for all Christians. It is a time, as such, to look back at the past, evaluate the present, and look forward with hope to the future, stated Opposition and Tamil National Alliance Leader R. Sampanthan in a message marking Easter.
The full text follows:
It is my joy to extend greetings to all those celebrating Easter in Sri Lanka.
Easter marks a celebration of hope for all Christians. It is a time, as such, to look back at the past, evaluate the present, and look forward with hope to the future.
Jesus Christ embodies the need for love, peace, and reconciliation among all people. His life also marked a devotion to justice and a commitment to uplift the marginalized and the downtrodden in society.
It is my hope that as a nation, following the life and example of Jesus, we would strive this Easter to strengthen the bonds of unity among the different communities and break down the barriers of distrust among us.
We are presently at a crucial juncture in our countrys history. I call upon all Sri Lankans, therefore, in the true spirit of Easter, to rise to the challenge, join hands, and work towards creating a future that is marked by justice, peace, hope, and reconciliation for all our people.
Easter message from Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka: Let us show solidarity with the poor and the marginalised
Easter is the most sublime feast of the Liturgical Year in which we proclaim and celebrate the victory of Jesus of Nazareth the Risen Lord Our Saviour, over sin and death. We let the words of the angels resound in our ears,
Why do you look for the living among the dead He is not here, but has risen(Luke.24:5). This year we make this joyful proclamation at a time when we as the Church in Sri Lanka focus our attention on St. Joseph Vaz who made Jesus Christ alive in our midst, states Rt. Rev.Dr.J.Winston S.Fernando S.S.S., President, Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka and Rt. Rev.Dr.D.Valence Mendis, Secretary General,Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka in a release.
The release adds: Easter is an experience for us to discover the joy of believing in Jesus by being in solidarity with the poor and the marginalised. It also invites us to discover that our faith in Jesus is an inestimable gift given to each and everyone of us. Easter is quite a fitting season to thank God for our faith in the person of Jesus, the Christ. God has bestowed upon us this unique gift of our faith in Gods only begotten Son.
Thus, we also need to thank all those who were in strumental in communicating to us this gift of our faith. The unparalleled mission accomplished by Fr.Joseph Vaz in rekindling the gift of faith echoes in our minds as we renew our faith in Christ in this Easter.
This is also a suitable time for us Priests, Religious and Laity to rededicate our missionary commitment in the footsteps of St. Joseph Vaz, the Apostle of Sri Lanka.
The Risen Lord appeared to His disciples and granted them the gift of peace. True peace is an outcome of justice. We celebrate this Easter at a time in which the people in our country are searching for new paths to establish justice and truth. There is an effort to develop solidarity and reconciliation among the people in our motherland. This could be done only if we respect one another avoiding petty differences and safeguarding each others dignity. At this Easter, there, fore let us implore the gift of peace and justice upon our dear country and its people.
While we thank God and rejoice in the unique gift of peace, let us also be mindful of those who suffer for the lack of the basic requirements of life. In spite of the different schemes for economic development, most of our people seem to be entrenched in poverty.
Our Christian discipleship always invites us to care for those in need since it is our duty to recognise the face of Jesus in those who suffer. Our Easter joy must make us recognise ever more deeply the demands of Christian discipleship. We need to do all we can to alleviate the pains of those around us. May they recognise in and through us the joy and the beauty of believing in Jesus and in becoming his disciples. May we become the agents of the peace the Risen Saviour communicated to His disciples.

We wish all our faithful and our readers the joy and the peace of the Risen Saviour!
Time to rejoice: Amaratunga
Easter is a time for rejoicing thankfully assured that sin is forgiven and life extends beyond the soil of the earth, stated Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga in a message marking Easter.

Easter celebrating the glory of the Risen Lord marks the end of the Holy Week commemorating the Crucifixion, Death and Resurrection of Our Saviour Jesus Christ. The glorious rising from the dead forms the bedrock of your Christian faith which manifests the divinity and humanity of Our Lord.
The Resurrection defeating death and triumphing over the forces of sin and evil opened the gates to the Kingdom of God to mankind for eternal life in union with God himself.
So Easter is a time for rejoicing thankfully assured that sin is forgiven and life extends beyond the soil of the earth.
Let us awaken to demonstrate our committed gratitude to the Saviour by contemplating and reflecting on His message of love, reconciliation and justice extending to our neighbor and society at large for peaceful co-existence.
Wishing you a blessed and meaningful Easter, may its message bring you a new re-awakening with new aspirations and new hope contributing to a way forward in a peaceful country.
Coinciding with the Holy Week, our Buddhist and Hindu brethren celebrate their culture and tradition based New Year and I take this opportunity to wish them a happy and Prosperous Sinhala and tamil New Year.

Florida declares state of emergency because of wildfires
US: The governor of Florida declared a state of emergency Tuesday as more than 100 wildfires burned large swathes of land in the southeastern US state.
The measure by Rick Scott frees up more resources to fight the fires and distribute supplies to people affected by them.
Today I am declaring a state of emergency in Florida to ensure we are ready to respond to and prepare for these fires, Scott said.
The Florida Forest Service said 105 fires are now burning in the state, with 23 of them burning more than 100 acres (40 hectares).
The blazes have torched more than 8,000 hectares of land. Since January, fires have blackened around 28,000 hectares in the southeastern state.
Weather forecasters predict the next few months will be hotter and drier than usual in Florida, so more forest fires are expected.
This may only get worse as we enter the hotter summer months and it is crucial that we take every action right now to be prepared, Scott said. In the first three months of the year, wildfires have burned 2.5 times as much land as in the same period of last year.
We havent seen this active of a season since 2011, said Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam.
Were seeing that every area of our state is susceptible to wildfire, he added. - AFP

Flying bails could become a thing of the past
The spectacular sight of bails flying through the air as a jubilant bowler celebrates might not be seen much longer, after crickets lawmaker approved the use of tethers to protect players from injury.
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), guardian of the laws of cricket, has taken steps to protect wicketkeepers from the sort of horrific eye injury that ended the career of South Africas Mark Boucher, by ratifying the use of tethers to limit the distance that bails can travel when the wicket is broken. The MCC has altered law 8.3, following an approach from companies in South Africa and the UK who submitted designs for tethers attaching bails to the stumps, without limiting their ability to be dislodged. It involves two holes drilled into the off and leg stumps.
If it prevents someone losing their eyesight, its got to be worth considering, Fraser Stewart, the MCCs laws manager, told ESPNcricinfo.  Stuff

Govt. must take over SAITM: GMOA
The government must take over SAITM, not only the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said.
Addressing the media at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the GMOA will not let the government make SAITM function as a private company. The GMOA does not agree to let a private company use a state body which runs with public funds. According to Dr. Zoysa, a statement issued by the Higher Education Ministry on April 7, has reassured the facts presented by the GMOA. The statement said so called MBBS degree holders from SAITM do not have competence to obtain registration from the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). That is why clinical training and examination have been proposed for them by the Higher Education Ministry, he said.
Dr. Zoysa said SAITM has failed to manage its hospital as a teaching hospital. The Higher Education Ministry propose to take it over and fulfill its shortcomings. The Attorney General's Department should rectify the wrong details it presented to the Court of Appeal, he said. The GMOA Secretary said the pressure put on the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) by politicians should be defeated by uniting professionals in Sri Lanka. The SLMC is an independent body established by the Act number 40 of 1988. The Ceylon Medical Council (CMC) was established by the Medical Council ordinance number 24 of 1924, he said.

Japan to be Sri Lankas partner in development
As Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe wound up his official tour to Japan yesterday, he walked away with Japanese Prime Minster, Shinzo Abe promising development assistance to Sri Lanka and in return Sri Lanka would ensure that her Ports, once developed would remain open to all.
Issuing a final joint statement at the Japanese Prime Ministers office, the heads of state, said that in principle they agreed that the Indo-Pacific Oceans needed to be free and open, including their ports.
Wickremesinghe in his speeches earlier this week had also invited Japan to be part of the Trincomalee harbour development project along with India while also inviting Japanese private firms to bid for the new terminal at the Colombo Port- A move seen to balance present Chinese investments in the Ports of Colombo Hambantota.
On Wickremesinghes ninth visit to Japan, Abe said they exchanged candid views on security, maritime cooperation, economy and economic cooperation.
He explained that while the era of Indo-Pacific was being ushered in, True regional prosperity could not come to being without the realization of a free and open Indo-pacific.
To make this happen it is indispensable for Sri Lanka to achieve Sustainable growth as a hub and develop ports that are open to all, further stated Abe and added, The Prime Minister and I were in complete agreement with such concepts.
Thus Abe said Japan would aid Sri Lanka in developing quality infrastructure and be a partner for sustainable growth in Sri Lanka.
Accordingly the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Japan, Dammika Ganganath Disanayake and Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Kenichi Syganuma exchanged notes on: the loan for rural infrastructure development, loan for the further expansion of the Kalu Ganga water project and a grant aid for economic and social development.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe reiterating Abe, said that as island nations we must trade with everyone and that there should be a stable maritime order in the world.
He further explained that like Abe, he too agreed on the freedom of navigation of the seas and that there should not be any imbalances in the Indian Ocean.
Stability should be agreed to by all of us and free commerce and transparent economic cooperation is the basis of going forward and basis of friendship between two countries.
The stability of the regions depend on its economic prosperity and social development, he added.
Wickremesinghe further reiterated that all the ports developed in Sri Lanka would only be used for commercial activities and not for any military purposes.

Malik ton as Pakistan down WI to take series
PROVIDENCE, GUYANA, Tuesday - Shoaib Malik scored an unbeaten century as Pakistan beat West Indies by six wickets to clinch victory in their one day international series in Guyana on Tuesday.
Malik sealed the win -- and his ton -- in spectacular fashion, smashing a six off West Indies captain Jason Holder to wrap up victory with nearly seven overs to spare.
Maliks 101, which included two sixes and ten fours, was matched by an assured 81 from Mohammad Hafeez as Pakistan finished on 236 for four in reply to the home sides 233 for nine.
I cant thank Hafeez enough for the way he played because he took all the pressure off me, said Malik after collecting both the Man of the Match and Man of the Series awards.
West Indies fought hard and credit to them but this really gives us encouragement going into the Champions Trophy.
Hafeez completely dominated their partnership, his innings coming off 86 balls with two sixes and eight fours before a miscued sweep off Ashley Nurse found Veerasammy Permaul on the backward square-leg boundary.
Permaul, the left-arm spinner brought into the match at the expense of fast bowler Alzarri Joseph on a turning track, proved expensive while leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo also lacked potency in helpful conditions.
I felt we had a decent enough total but we just couldnt put enough pressure on Malik and Hafeez after the early breakthroughs, said Holder.
Ive got no regrets about the decision to bat first because I think we recovered well and should have made a better effort of defending that total.
West Indies were indebted to Shai Hope (71) and Jason Mohammed (59) after their top-order once again crumbled.

Men should not clip the wings of women: Malala
PAKISTAN: Men should not clip the wings of women and let them fly, Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai said as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres designated her as the youngest-ever Messenger of Peace.
The role of men, fathers and brothers is really important.
There were so many girls just like me in Swat Valley who could have spoken out but their fathers did not allow them, their brothers did not allow them to do so, the 19-year-old Pakistani education activist said. She said her case was different as her father did not stop her, Malala said during a ceremony here on Monday to designate her as the UN Messenger of Peace, the highest honour bestowed by the Secretary-General on a global citizen.
... All I had was a father and a family who said yes you can speak. It is your choice. I think that is what we need.
We need brothers and fathers and all men in the family to let women be who they want to be.
She said her father always told people not to ask him what he did for Malala, but ask what I didnt do I didnt clip her wings.
Men should not clip the wings of women and let them fly and let them go forward, Yousafzai said, as her father Ziauddin Yousafzai sat in the audience and watched her.
Yousafzai, who was shot in 2012 by the Taliban for attending classes, is the youngest-ever UN Messenger of Peace and the first one to be designated by Guterres since he assumed office in January this year.
With the designation, Yousafzai joins other current Messengers of Peace including Oscar-winning actor Leonardo di Caprio for climate change, actor Charlize Theron, whose focus is the prevention of HIV and elimination of violence against women and actor Michael Douglas whose focus is disarmament. - DECCAN CHRONICLE

## Date: Thursday, April 13, 2017 - 01:00
MY PRECIOUS JESUS, HOW GREAT THOU ART..
Consider all the world's thy hands have made  how great thou art.
How many times have I said it and how many times have I meant it I get that piercing rip through my heart when I look into thy loving, compassionate eyes, but what have I done for thee. Nothing at all. But Jesus you know I love you with my heart and soul. Everything climaxes ultimately to Good Friday that finally you redeemed us all. There is no one Christian who would have passed a day and for that matter, a moment without repenting this Lent season but that is insufficient. It has to come from the heart and be a commitment to Jesus. Many of us feel the tears rolling down, sighs escaping and pierced by guilt but remain mortals. That's we are. When the week of agony passes away and Jesus Christ ascends, we all forget our spiritual pledges
And continue our sinful lives forgetting how great he is.
UNDERSTAND THE WORD
For Jesus to abide in us, we have to understand his word and accept the final sacrifice, any child of God from time and original translation in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek texts, will understand the correct meaning and grasp the greater degree of assurance, perhaps because of the underlying cultural and historical significance. Every word in their sacred identity were used in the ancient and modern translations, to English as well as in other Languages in the presence of the Holy Spirit.
The Holy Bible remains our contact with God and his son, Jesus Christ.
It is the most translated authentic text to be read by millions of races and nations and anyone dare contradict its statements. We find Lord Jesus's birth, sacrifice and ascension in the New Testament.
WHO WAS JESUS
The Living Saviour, our servant who serve us, the Living water who quench us, our food that he provides us, he is the way and the truth, he is our life - giving shepherd. He is also our light in darkness. He is the way when we stumble. Jesus is god and the coming king in all glory. He is the door, we have only to knock and it is open to one and all. He is our Redeemer because of which he sacrificed his beautiful and compassionate life to save the word. The Risen Lord the world venerate in spirituality.
I know Jesus as my Saviour but he knows me better; my frailties and how I let him down in moments of temptations of the world but he loves me over and over again with no animosity but with compassion. Jesus said I am the Door but what lay behind the door is our own seeking and the door has come down to all of us and it is open to believers who are willing to understand his descriptive metaphors of revealing himself. If so, we must ask ourselves why we continue standing in the dark
A believing Christian is not nominal. They are not the progeny of the first Christian generation who have strayed from Biblical Christianity and often under the influence distorted teachings of Jesus Christ but there are others who sacrificed their lives for spiritual truth, the catalysts of such spiritual revolution.
Therefore, we cannot live without Jesus for wholeness of life that many non-Christians have come to recognized in our Lord, especially because of his crucifixion and the way he sacrificed to redeem the world not only those who believed in him but all non-believers.
Good Friday is not only for us but for the whole world, every individual every nation up in arms against each other, Jesus belongs to everyone, even to Pilate who sentenced him to death and Herod who found Jesus innocent against charges leveled against him. Even upon the cross, he forgave the thief who trusted him and repented. Such was the undying love for all. The Bible speaks of the nine fold fruit of the Holy Spirit (Gal. 5:22). It refers to the character of Jesus. Remember, it is the fruit and not fruits. It is an integrated whole. It is one multiple fruit and it is the Holy Spirit who produces Christ character in us. Jesus vanquished death and rose again to fulfill his Father's promise to release the bondage that Satan holds over us, His children.
Jesus knew his time had come for the mission to be completed and obeys his Father in heaven. He knew by now everything was completed and in order to the scriptures to come true. He said I am thirsty'. He was given a bowl of cheap wine. Jesus drank the wine and said It is finished'. Then he bowed his head and died. It was Friday. An army officer who saw what happened, praised God. Saying Certainly, he was a good man'.
Earlier, Jesus was put through immense suffering carrying the heavy cross up the hill by the soldiers who had no mercy on him. It was about twelve o'clock when the sun stopped shining and darkness covered the whole country until three o'clock and the curtains hanging in the Temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split apart, the graves broke open and many of God's people had died were raised to life. It was amazing. They left the graves and after Jesus rose from death, they went into the Holy City where many people saw them. The soldiers, who were watching Jesus, saw the earthquakes and everything else that happened and were terrified.
The man named Joseph from Arimathea who loved Jesus very much and to whom the body of Jesus was given by Pilate for burial, took charge of the mortal remains of Jesus. That night Joseph and Nicodemus took about thirty kilograms of spices, a mixture of myrrh and alooes and wrapped him in linen which is the Jewish custom of preparing for burial. After everyone left the burial site, Mary Magdeline could not tear herself away from Jesus because she loved him so much, much more than all who knew Jesus. However, she departed only to return early morning.
JESUS APPEARS FIRSTTO MARY MAGDALINE
At dawn, Mary stood crying outside the tomb. She was heart-broken and in despair as she peeped over and looked into the tomb and saw the angels dressed in white sitting where the body of Jesus had been, one at the head and the other at feet.
Woman, why are you crying they asked her and Mary answered,
They have taken my Lord away and I do not know where they have put him.
Then she turned around and saw Jesus standing there but did not know it was Jesus.
Woman, why are you crying Jesus asked her. Who is it that you are looking for She thought it was the gardener. So, she said to him,
If you took him away Sir, tell me where you have put him and I will go and get him'. Jesus called her Mary'. Immediately, she turned around to face Jesus and uttered in Hebrew,
Rabboni (Meaning Teacher)
Do not hold on to me Jesus advised her because I have not yet gone back to my Father but go to my brothers and tell them that I am returning to Him who is my Father and their Father, my God and their God.
The magnified Mary went and told the disciples what the Lord had related to her. Her heart was filled with joy as Jesus appeared to her first among all, a woman raised from sin and whom Jesus too loved.
In the recess of our hearts, let us welcome Jesus into our midst this season and thereafter and strike an everlasting relationship as that of Mary in the stillness of Lent.
An excerpt from a message to his sheep by the Lord Bishop of Colombo, Rt. Rev. Delo Canagasaby during the lent season to cleanse our hearts in the solitude of prayer'.
Stillness, silence and calm are becoming so removed from our lives and even from our worship of God. And yet, it is in the stillness and in the silence that God speaks to us and we discern his will Be still and know that I am God (Psalm 46:10) Let us make time during this Lent withdrawal, for quietness, for stillness and for listening, so that our hearts and minds may be attuned God's presence and our walk strengthened and made surer.
Our Pilgrimagefrom Lent to Easter
The period of Lent is a preparation for the events of the Passion week where we meditate upon and accompany Jesus on his last entry to Jerusalem, to the last Supper with his disciples, to his vigil in the Garden of Gethsemane, to his betrayal, trial and execution. At his trial Jesus told Pilate, I have come into the world to bear witness to Truth(John 18.37). As disciples of Jesus, the Church too is called upon to follow the example of her Lord and Master to stand for and witness to the truth. The truth is more often than not, unpalatable, inconvenient, a nuisance and even n unnecessary luxury for those in position of power and authority, as it was to Herod, Pilate and the many Herods and Pilates of history then and now and as it is indeed it can be for us all. The truth is nevertheless what renews and librates us from ourselves, our selfish ways, our small mindedness and our pretty concerns.
Let us then together partake this Lent of that death that Christ died in order to make us free. For he offers us a better way of life, emptied of the heavy weight of our self centredness, so that together with Christ we may rise, as the scripture declares . Set free from bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. (Roman 8.21)

NEW YEAR MESSAGES
Decisive year to determine future: Sampanthan
It is a year that could be decisive in determining the future of our country and people.
My hope and prayer, therefore, is that we would unite in the coming New Year, to achieve our dream of building a peaceful and prosperous Sri Lanka that upholds the dignity and equality of all communities, stated Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan and Tamil National Alliance Leader in a message marking the Sinhala and Tamil New Year.
The full text follows:
I would like to extend my heartiest wishes to all those celebrating the Sinhala and Tamil New Year.
As always, a new year marks a new beginning and brings new hope and expectation for everyone. As a nation, we have a crucial year ahead of us. It is a year that could be decisive in determining the future of our country and people. My hope and prayer, therefore, is that we would unite in the coming new year, to achieve our dream of building a peaceful and prosperous Sri Lanka that upholds the dignity and equality of all communities.
I believe, however, that this dream could only be realized through a new constitution. Hence, I call upon all citizens to support the promulgation of the new constitution, ensuring the realization of the dream of a new Sri Lanka.As we celebrate the new year, I would also like to encourage that we remember our brothers and sisters who are vulnerable, marginalized, and grieving among us.
They deserve our attention, support, and urgent action.
May this new year bring true happiness, peace, and prosperity to all.
Fine example to depict spiritual bondage: Ravi
I extend my greetings wholeheartedly for Sinhala and Tamil New Year 2017 which is celebrated in an honorable backdrop where peoples supremacy is assured, freedom of expression and freedom for life are secured, stated Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in his message for the New Year.
The message adds: Having passed several decades of gloomy and agonizing eras, I believe that we are today walking down the red carpet of coexistence and equality.
Coexistence is not a new concept. We celebrate Sinhala and Tamil New Year together since time immemorial and it is a fine example to depict the spiritual bondage among all Sri Lankans irrespective of their caste, class, creed or race.
Simultaneously, we know that all of you are patiently tolerating so much hardship by making a lot of commitments for the wellbeing of the future of this country. Wrong decisions and lack of managerial skills in our economy in the past have compelled us to suffer today.
However, the principle of my life is that any determined person with self-confidence can face any challenge.
Therefore, lets face challenges together and lets stand together.
May your lives be prosperous and such spiritual strength brings you merriment in this Sinhala and Tamil New Year!
Festival of happiness: Ekanayake
The Sinhala and Tamil New Year based on the trajectory of sun and moon can be described as the national festival that creates happiness and joy among the common masses, stated State Minister of Lands T. B. Ekanayake.
The message adds: The dawn of blessed springtime in the month of Bak bringing a rich harvest consolidates national unity.
The New Year ushered in according to auspicious times giving pride of place to customs and traditions creates new hope and aspirations in peoples hearts.

A Health Ministry statement said `Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), the drug used to treat Influenza A(H1N1) patients is freely available countrywide and there is no shortage in this drug.

Rare honour Sri Lankan to captain Harrow against Eton
Sri Lankan-born Rahul Wijeratne will be creating history when he leads Harrow this year in their traditional cricket match against Eton at the home of cricket - Lords Cricket Ground on June 24, a 55-overs-a-side contest. Rahul, son of Sri Lanka business tycoon Ravi Wijeratne has been appointed captain of Harrow School for the current English school cricket season.
Seldom has a Sri Lankan had the honour of leading such a prestigious institute which is over 400 years old and in the oldest of all cricket fixtures  Eton v Harrow which will be the 177th contest between the two schools this year.
The Eton v Harrow cricket match is an annual fixture between Eton College and Harrow School and is one of the longest-running annual sporting fixtures in the world and, the only annual school cricket match still to be played at Lords.
In 1957 one of the finest all-round cricketers produced by Sri Lanka, Gamini Goonesena became the first Asian player to captain Cambridge University in their traditional match against Oxford University at Lords.
Rahul doesnt think that he is the first Sri Lankan to captain Harrow at cricket. To my knowledge there has been one before me but there have been multiple Sri Lankans who have walked to play on the hallowed turf of Lords. My brother and I played in my first big match three years ago, said Rahul.
Recounting his appointment of leading such a prestigious institution Rahul said, Its a great feeling. I have played in the big match twice already and have thoroughly enjoyed both occasions. To be made captain just makes the day even more special especially as the game is played at the Home of Cricket  Lords.
Although a resident of England since the age of six, Rahul said that even though he had spent the major part of his life in Old Blighty he was still a proud Sri Lankan.
Although I have been in England for my school life  I will always be a proud Sri Lankan. To be made captain of a school that is quintessentially British such as Harrow makes me more proud as I lived in Sri Lanka until I was 6, said Rahul.
I entered Harrow as my brother was already at the school and I got a cricket scholarship too. I wanted to go to boarding school and this has helped me focus on both my academic and sporting needs. I want to read Politics at Leeds University in the UK next year, he said.
Rahul had his primary education at the Overseas School of Colombo before he moved to the UK where he started at St Martins Northwood and then moved to Harrow at the age of 13.
I played cricket really early since I could pick up a bat and just played in the back garden. I joined my first club at the age of seven and havent looked back since, said Rahul.
I was very young so I never played while I lived in Colombo, but for a few years I came back and played for the Mercantile Cricket Association and also in the Nelson Mendis tournament for three years. Growing up in Sri Lanka its hard not to gain an immediate love for the game.
The energy that the game brings to the country is immense and I can clearly see it growing every time I come back. My brothers also played cricket and we all played together, he said.
Not surprisingly one of Rahuls cricketing heroes is the great Kumar Sangakkara, the former Sri Lanka captain currently playing with English county Surrey.
Two big names pop up when I think of cricket. Kumar Sangakkara, the way he leads the country in tough times is what stands out and what I look up to, said Rahul. The way he behaves on and off the pitch is something I would also like to copy in the future. Secondly, is Alistair Cook (the former England captain) who has scored vast amounts of runs for England and his modesty is admirable.
Talking of Harrows chances of winning their traditional encounter against Eton, Rahul said, I have always felt the game is based upon how the pressure is dealt with. I have been an underdog one year and won the game but I feel this year will be a great chance for Harrow to win again. Its a rather young side so a lot of them will have nothing to lose and will hopefully be able to perform well on the day.
The match was traditionally a two-day, two-innings affair, but in 1982 it was reduced to one day and one innings a side.
It moved to a limited overs format in 1999. Of the 176 matches played so far Eton leads with 56 wins to Harrows 52 with 68 drawn. Last years contest was abandoned as a draw due to rain with Harrow scoring 163 off 45.5 overs and Eton replying with 113-8 in 45.4 overs. Wijeratne batting at no. 4 was dismissed for 19 and opening the bowling took one wicket for 24.
I would say I am a batting all-rounder and at school level I will be used as the main spinner in the side. I bat at number 4 usually but will bat at 3 for the school this year, said Rahul.
Getting appointed captain of Harrow has been a huge moment in my cricket career and something I am extremely proud of. I also have captained the Middlesex under 17 sides and hopefully will continue to do so. I was very pleased to be involved in the England Cricket Development tournament at the end of last summer and my most memorable game was against Essex County Cricket Club where I hit 165 in a three-day match, he said.
Talking of the individuals who have shaped his career so far Rahul said, I have had multiple coaches in my life but I lot of my success boils down to Middlesex County Cricket Club who I have represent proudly since I was 11. Also, the coaches at Harrow such as Steven Jones, Graham Furber and Robin Martin-Jenkins (son of late cricket writer and commentator Christopher Martin-Jenkins) who have helped greatly.
Apart from cricket Rahul has also excelled in two other sports. I play two rather unique games called Racket and Fives which are played by a handful of schools in the UK. I have won the Fives National Championships twice and have reached the semi-final in Rackets Championships twice too.
Rahul who lives with his mother and three brothers in the UK (his father is based in Sri Lanka) said he will look to gain a professional contract at Middlesex and work hard to become a first-class cricketer.
I will also continue to work on my academic side by studying politics at university and eventually I want to move back to Sri Lanka. My brothers, all share a love for the game and my parents just sit back and watch us, said Rahul.

Rogaining, a sport tailor made for Sri Lanka
Rogaining is a lesser known sport in Sri Lanka, but will soon be popularized due to the island's very appropriate landscape for the sport.
Rogaining is the sport of long distance cross-country navigation. The championship rogaine is of 24 hours duration but there are several shorter versions of 3, 6, 8, 12, and 15 hours. There have also been longer events (dubbed 'Endurogaines') lasting 48 and 50 hours. In their native Australia, Rogaines are usually held every month during weekends near full moons, with annual state championships and an annual national championship. They require dozens of volunteers to run, including course setters and caterers and are often attended by hundreds of participants. A competitive 24-hour rogaine requires a map area of around 250 km 2 (~ 100 mi 2 ), for relatively flat terrain; terrain with significant climbs may require far less or far more area, depending on the placement of checkpoints. Teamwork, endurance, competition and an appreciation of the natural environment are features of the sport.
Rogaining involves both route planning and navigation between checkpoints using a variety of map types.
Rogaines are generally day and night events in which teams of two to five members travel entirely on foot, navigating by map and compass. Teams select their own order of visiting checkpoints in terrain that varies from open countryside to hilly forest.Teams travel at their own pace and anyone from children to grandparents can experience the personal satisfaction that comes from cross-country navigation at their own level of competition and comfort.
A central base camp known as a 'hash house' provides hot meals and teams may return at any time to eat, rest, sleep or enjoy the fellowship. Teams travel at their own pace, and anyone from children to grandparents can experience the personal satisfaction that comes from cross-country navigation at individual levels of competition and comfort.
Rogaining can trace its roots back to 1947 when the first of many events with some of the features of rogaines was organized by the Melbourne University Mountaineering Club. The events from the 1940s eventually led to the birth of the sport of rogaining in April, 1976, in Melbourne, Australia. The sport was named, rules were adopted and the worlds first rogaining association was formed (the Victorian Rogaining Association). Growth of the association and the sport occurred rapidly over the next decade.
Teams of two to five members visit as many checkpoints as possible in the time allowed. Shorter duration rogaines often allow solo competitors. Checkpoints are scored differently depending on level of difficulty in reaching them; therefore teams choose a strategy (for example, to visit many low score checkpoints). Teams travel entirely on foot, navigating by map and compass between checkpoints in terrain that varies from open farmland to hilly forest.

SINHALA AND TAMIL NEW YEAR MESSAGE: Aluth Avurudda serves as a catalyst for fresh thinking: President
The customary rites and rituals attached with the Avurudda, based on the transition of the sun, depict the social connotation of the deep and subtle connection between man and nature in physical and spiritual facets since the origins of life on Planet Earth many ages ago, states President Maithripala Sirisena in a Sinhala and Tamil New Year message.
The Presidents message adds: Aluth Avurudda is a turning point of our lives as it resuscitates to serve as a catalyst to change our attitudes for bringing some fresh thinking.
The manifestation of rituals during the Avurudu festivities is a living example for gratefulness of the human being, since time immemorial, and such values are still alive in the collective consciousness of the people due to the strength of our cultural sprit in an age where the agricultural life style is being transformed, tremendously.
The entire gamut of the Avurudu customs portrays praising nature which is similar to a caring mother figure towards mankind; as she offers humans the sustenance they need to survive. It also showcases a renewal of the close relationships with fellow members of society. The Avurudu Nakath system has paved the way to time management with a time table for the activities come under the Avurudu celebrations. Practicing the exchange of money at an auspicious time in all solemnity in the Avurudu celebrations is a deep-rooted value of our distinctive cultural heritage as it denotes being authentic in the transactions is a noblest manner as both giving and receiving are taking place simultaneously in a much transparent manner.
The intention of the whole range of Avurudu customs, marked in line with the transition of the Sun, is the formation of a new man free from regressive thinking and menial attitudes.
Lets determine to join hands to build a country where reconciliation and coexistence are given pride of place while making the victories achieved more meaningful. I wish a very happy, prosperous and peaceful Aluth Avurudda to all Sri Lankans living in the country and overseas, the message adds.

Two nabbed while transporting dudong meat
Two persons who had been transporting parts of dugong (sea cow) for meat had been arrested by the Navy on Sunday in Thavulpadu, Mannar.
Parts of dugong which had been killed for meat were being transported by a three wheeler. The weight of the haul was about 82 kg. Dugong, a rare marine mammal, is being hunted for its meat which is sold illegally.
The suspects, who were produced before the Mannar Magistrates Court on Monday, were released on surety bail of Rs 100,000 each. The Wildlife Conservation Department was conducting investigations to trace the killers of the animal.
Dugong is classified as vulnerable to extinction according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Dugongs are protected under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance.
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), to which Sri Lanka acceded in 1979, limits or bans the trade of derived products from it.
Dugongs found in sea grass meadows in the North West of Sri Lanka, namely the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay, are highly threatened and the species is probably critically endangered, according to marine biologists.

Ven. Ananda Thera accuses Rajitha of double standards
If the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) and the Public Services United Nurses Union (PSUNU) unite, a people friendly government can be formed for sure, PSUNU President Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera said.
Releasing a statement to the media yesterday he said it was the PSUNU which commenced to offer diplomas for nurses in 2011 at Temple Trees with the participation of (then) President.
Therefore, the current Health Minister should not give birth certificates to others children. If he does not know the history, he should learn from President Sirisena.
According to Ven. Ananda Thera, the Health Minister had admired the President of the Government Nursing Officers Association during the recent ceremony held to hand over diploma certificates to 1,290 nurses and indirectly he had ordered them to obtain membership of the association. This is purely an unethical and unacceptable act, he said.
When the GMOA and PSUNU supported the Dental Surgeons Association strikes during the regime of late President J.R. Jayawardena, the current Health Minister praised both organizations and now he is accusing them.
This shows his double standards. At that time he did not care if patients were affected by strikes, Ven. Ananda Thera added.
