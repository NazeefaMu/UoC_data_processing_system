A century of friendly rivalry: Trinity-Antonian big match
It will not just be a historic moment for Kandy's two great educational institutions, but a milestone in Sri Lankan school cricket when Trinity College takes on St. Anthony's College in their Centenary Battle of the Blues in Kandy on March 10 and 11 under the theme of 'A century of friendly rivalry' at the Pallekekke International Cricket Stadium.
The Trinity-Antonian joint committee called upon a press briefing at Hotel Galadari recently to announce an array of activities they have organised in line with the Centenary Big Match and to launch a new website www.trinityantonian.com where one can find important information related to the big match from its inception in 1914 to-date and all activities the joint committee has arranged in celebration of Centenary big match. The launch of the Centenary big match logo which will be used in all activities related to the match was also in the agenda of the day.
The sixth oldest school cricket encounter of the country has an excellent record from the beginning and known to be the most peaceful big match in Sri Lanka, with no incidences of hatred and clashes throughout the 100 years. The brotherhood and rich tradition, the two schools are bestowed with have made the Trinity-Antonian big match one of the biggest annual sporting events in the Hill Capital.
The two schools have an impressive cricket history and are also two of the oldest schools to take up the game in Sri Lanka. Trinity entered the game first and played the first match in 1893 followed by Antonians in 1899. After 99 years the big match tally stands 23 victories for Trinity and 12 wins for St. Anthony's with 64 matches ending in draws. Trinity dominated the pre-independence era winning most of the matches and Antonians registered most of their wins after 1948. The John Halangoda Challenge Trophy was introduced to the big match during the later part of the last century in memory of an outstanding Trinitian who subsequently turned out to be a great cricket coach at St. Anthony's. Shanogeeth Shanmuganathan will captain the Trinity side while Mohamed Alf will be the skipper of the Antonians at the Centenary big match. It will be interesting to see who will be the lucky captain to take home the special gold coin embossed with the Centenary big match logo which will be use for the toss.
When asked why Trinity-Antonian encounter does not follow the tradition of extending the match to a three-day affair with the dawn of the centenary, a joint committee member replied that they had lengthy discussions over the matter and said most of the Old boys of the two schools are living out of Kandy or abroad. So most of Old boys from outside Kandy stay only for the one-day match due to their other commitments. Even though for the Centenary match they expect a large gathering of expatriates and locals, they have decided to continue as a two-day match mainly due to lack of spectators. "We will also continue the big match at our school venues after the centenary match," he explained.
Both schools have produced excellent cricketers who have graced the national and international arena. Among them are Jack Anderson, A.C.M. Lafir, Mahesh Goonatilleke, Bernard Perera, Marlon Von Hagt, Ruwan Kalpage, Piyal Wijetunga, Muthiah Muralitharan, and Sajith Fernando (all from St. Anthony's) and Ravi Ratnayeke, Nilantha Ratnayake, Kaushalya Weeraratne, Kumar Sangakkara, Sachith Pathirana, Niroshan Dickwella, and Lahiru Kumara (all from Trinity) to name a few.
St. Anthony's principal Rev. Fr. Rector Henry Bernard Wijeratne said that the specialty of the Trinity-Antonian big match is that it was never played for a win at any cost over the years. It has always maintained the gentle-manliness and friendship between the two schools. "This indeed is a remarkable achievement by two of the oldest schools in Kandy. Hill Country's Battle of the Blues has been a great platform that showcases class, talent and spirit of friendly revelry," Rev. Fr. Rector emphasized.
Speaking about the Centenary big match Trinity principal Andrew Fowler-Watt expressed his joy of being a part of this historic moment and said, "We have to show what sports should stand for. The two schools have set an example to other schools over the 100 years and hope they'll continue it for long. People from all around the world come here to be a part of this Centenary match, so we have to preserve the spirit of the game. I am eagerly waiting to celebrate my first big match win with Trinity this time, Fowler-Watt said.
Chairman, Organising Committee Chandrika Jayawardena explained the long list of activities the joint committee has lined up to celebrate this cricketing milestone. Among them, Antonian Global Conference (March 8 - Colombo), Antonian Cocktail Evening (March 8 JAIC Hilton), Antonians Vehicle parade (March 9), Traditional tea party (March 9 at school), Centenary night (March 10 - Earl's Regency), Antonian Cricket carnival - softball (March 12 - college grounds), Centenary Dinner Dance (March 18 - Earl's Regency) are the prominent events.

A small HUTCH logo appears on the side of the screen that can be tapped swiftly to expand and show the subscribers detailed balance and enable to conveniently activate popular data packs directly on the screen itself without exiting the screen.
The subscriber will therefore be constantly aware of his balances and can pre-purchase additional packs before running out of balance resulting in suddenly interrupting their internet experience.
Commenting on the latest introduction, HUTCH Sri Lanka, Chief Executive Officer, Thirukumar Nadarasa said, HUTCH continuously strives to bring innovative service features to our subscribers to enable them to more conveniently access and use HUTCH services without interruption.

Dr. Binod Chaudhary, a true friend of Sri Lanka
Sri Lankas enterprises and companies are doing well and they dont need any guidance, said Dr. Binod Chaudhary, the first and only billionaire from Nepal listed in the Forbes list.
He said some Sri Lankan companies have set up offices overseas and some are even listed in the London and New York Stock exchanges.
Speaking at the launch of his book Making it big in Colombo, he said that today businesses have taken a different turn. You find global taxi companies like UBER that dont own a single cab, and hotel companies like B&B that own over 700,000 rooms in less than one year and also companies like Google, Facebook which are all over the world doing business without people not talking to its management.
Talking about himself he said that he is happy being a billionaire but sad that his country, Nepal was in poverty. He said that the 2015 earthquake not only shook the ground of Nepal but changed the lives of over 25% of the 25 million population.
My aim is to see that the country elevates to the next level before I die and to achieve this objective I will do my part, Chaudhary said.
He said that he may even take to politics once again if he could help in this crusade once again rather than being just one of the 600 members in the Nepal Parliament.
Commenting on the business he said that one reason for his success was he saw a potential of a project long before it even commenced and he believes that its instants and not the knowledge gained at business schools that helps to forgo business ventures. What I am saying is that only business school knowledge is not enough.
Dr. Chaudhary said that private sector is very important to a countrys growth and the living example was Korea where private brands like LG, Hyundai and Samsung helped to make the country a developed nation.
Its usual that businessmen help politicians during elections but then the politicians should not try to run the businesses when they are elected. Commenting on Sri Lanka he said that the liaison was started when he met entrepreneur, Tilak De Zoysa at one of the international chamber forums.
When I visited Sri Lanka there was a war going on and investors and tourists were rushing back. But I saw the potential in the country and invested in the leisure sector involving Tilak de Zoysa Jetwing and the Galle Face Hotels Group.
He said that he loves Sri Lanka and when the country bleeds he is in pain. My love for Sri Lanka and investments into the future dont have bearing as to who or which government is in power.
Meanwhile, former Foreign Affairs Minister and MP Prof. G. L. Peiris reviewing his book said that Dr. Chaudhary has been a true friend of Sri Lanka. I can boldly say that he has done more service to Nepal in education, health and training sectors than the government of Nepal.
He also said that he is a good reader of the future since when he visited Sri Lanka for the first time several SriLankan aircraft were in flames at the Colombo airport after the LTTE attack. Still he saw the silver lining in Sri Lanka and invested.
He also said that Chaudhary is a good thinking businessman who met strong challenges with ease. One he was framed for murder by a good friend but he proved his innocence. In another occasion when his loving father suffered a heart attack a close family circle member wanted 25% stake in the company. He successfully overcame these issues diplomatically. He said that Chaudhary is a strong believer in brands and he would never ever forego one.
He may drop a joint venture or even a partnership but never a brand.

Raees inspired by Sholay
Raees makers will be releasing its original sound track separately in the music album. The films director Rahul Dholakia says the source of inspiration was the Sholay album.
I was a kid when Sholay released, but I do remember listening to Gabbars theme and the iconic dialogues on radio. So, when the idea came up about the original soundtrack (OST) I was most excited, Dholakia said in a statement.
He added: We have some killer themes and extremely punchy dialogues  imagine the combination of both! That would be really cool as no one has done it before, and we have the substance so why not The makers decided on coming out with OST when the trailer of the film had a complete commercial touch with a foot tapping background score.
Set against the backdrop of the prohibition in Gujarat, Raees touches upon the way the alcohol industry crumbled and several illegal activities followed. Its trailer gives a glimpse of the story backed by heavy duty action sequences, and many thrilling moments. In the film, superstar Shah Rukh Khan essays the title role of Raees, a bootlegger. It also marks Pakistani actress Mahira Khans foray into Bollywood.
Meanwhile, Sunny Leone is seen dub smashing Shah Rukh Khans dialogue from the film and it is kind of funny. Sunny is doing an item number Laila Main Laila in Raees. The song is already a hit amongst her fans. Laila Main Laila is the remake of the original Laila O Laila that featured Zeenat Aman. In an interview with indianexpress.com, Sunny shares how she got to do the item number in Raees.

## Title: Abu Fuard, the irrepressible
## Supertitle:

Abu Fuard, the irrepressible
The story of Abu Fuard is a fascinating one. Not only was he a renowned cricketer and a wonderful all-rounder, what he did behind the scenes to steer the country to Test status remain engraved in the minds of those of us who saw this man in action both on and off the field, in the corridors of power and in cricketing fields in the hinterland of our country.
He schooled at Wesley College from where he graduated and launched his career that took him to stardom. As an off spinner he was a sensation. He had flight, variation and all the tricks of the trade. He was a pioneer in bowling what is now called the doosra made famous by Pakistans Saqlain Mushtaq.
The doosra is a delivery bowled with the off break action, but which pitches and instead of turning in goes towards the slips. As a right hand batsman, he had the knack of fitting into any slot. He was primarily an opening batsman and runs flowed from his bat at school, club and country level, although at national level he did not strike it that rich with the bat. He was brilliant at slip.
He bowled magnificently against Richie Benauds Australians in a whistle stop game at the Oval bagging five wickets which prompted Benaud to say he would have loved to have Fuard in his team that he was taking to England for the Ashes series.
I can vouch for his brilliance as I had the good fortune of playing with Fuard at the Colts and then later against him when he donned the Colombo Cricket Club colours; and facing his wiles, I went on to score my first Sara Trophy century. Fuard would give his 100 per cent and more on the field and any fielder dropping a catch off his bowling would get a tongue lashing and that lashing would make that fielder a better one.
That was Fuard the cricketer. Now about his Administrative and leadership qualities.
Before Gamini Dissanayake, then President of the Cricket fought the good fight breaching the defence of the lords at Lords and bowling them out, the game in Sri Lanka was centred and dominated by the elite schools, particularly Royal and S. Thomas the college known as the one by the sea.
History tells us that when Sri Lanka played what some condescendingly called whistle stop games against the full member ICC countries such as England, Australia and West Indies, the Sri Lanka team comprised five Royalists and five Thomians and the solitary man who fitted in from another school. Yes, that was the right handed genius with the willow the Great Mahadevan Sathasivam on whom I will dwell on in the columns to follow.
But after the fantastic achievement of Dissanayake for the country, the game broke out "tsunami like with every known school dotted on the map of Sri Lanka taking to the game with great enthusiasm, delight and joy.
Yet, the man behind the scenes who worked the trenches to make things happen was none other than that former Wesley, Moors, Colts and CCC cricketer, the all round ABU FUARD, the irrepressible. While still active in the game he decided that the best way to influence and bring about changes was to throw in his lot with the administration of the game.
He was a credible "Change Agent" as he was widely respected for his achievements as an excellent off spinner with a mythical 'doosara' action. And that's not all--he was a stylish batsman and a most reliable slip fielder. When Fuard spoke people listened because the records spoke for him and he spoke with all sincerity to bring Sri Lanka cricket to the global scene. He found a welcome place in the administration.
Once in the administration FUARD realized that the bottom line for him was getting Sri Lanka as a full member of the International Council. Fuard's task was to find a dynamic leader who had the prowess of persuasion and the political skill to bring about change.
Fortunately for FUARD living down his lane at Deal Place, Colpetty was a young, energetic and daring Minister in Gamini Dissanayake on whom President J.R. Jayewardene had shouldered the responsibility of delivering on what seemed impossible tasks such as diverting the Mahaweli in Gamini Dissanayake. Why not lure him to the Cricket Board, Abu Fuard mused.
This cannot rest as an idle dream---it had to be spun into reality. When approached, Dissanayake had his reservations as it involved taking on the Lords of Cricket who guarded their wickets jealously in an exclusive club. Dissanayake was conscious as was Fuard that this would end up as a "jihad"! Sri Lanka in Test Cricket Where is Sri Lanka Do they play cricket---a cynic was heard asking over a beer! So Fuard could not suffer insults nor suffer fools.
He worked tirelessly to convince Dissanayake that this was as important a challenge as any other and one that will put the country on the map of global sports. After many nights of deliberation and strategic thinking Dissanayake took on the challenge. And delivered he did, relying a lot on counselors foremost of whom was Fuard.
On being elevated as a full member of ICC, Dissanayake turned to Fuard and vested in him the challenge to architect the development of the game in all parts of the Island . Fuard broke the stranglehold that the elite schools held in the game by focusing the spotlight on the provincial schools where he knew there were many a gem unseen and uncut.
And today Sri Lankan cricket is dominated by talent from the provincial schools and the hinterland. If one takes a closer look at the game and the outstanding cricketers it has produced, the majority of them come from lesser known schools who before the country became a Test paying nation rarely played any competitive cricket. Fuard did everything possible to open the doors to the rural cricketers.
And yes, today the Sri Lanka team comprises many cricketers from the rural schools who have hugged the headlines here and abroad with their stupendous feats with either the willow or the ball and made the game and country proud. A fair share of that success no doubt should be credited to Fuard.
In addition, Dissanayake foisted the developing of the Trinity College grounds at Asgiriya to international standard to Fuard. Having been closely associated with Fuard I can vouch for the fact that he threw in his lot to see to the realization of the Asgiriya Stadium to international standard. Sadly the Asgriya Stadium is no more in use for Test cricket after the Pallekelle Stadium was built. Fuard travelled up and down to Asgiriya every day, supervising and instructing the engineers and the builders and seeing to its completion in record time.
A little anecdote: Once in a Sara game against Dimbulla at the Colts Ground, Fuard was bowling and I was fielding at deep mid on. Ubhaya de Silva the former Royal stalwart mistimed and hit a ball off Fuard that sailed high.
Watching the flight of the ball coming down my heart was in my mouth. I knew that if I were to drop that catch the choicest words from Fuard awaited me. I cupped my hands together, but the ball popped out. A cold shiver ran through me and I was trembling and shaking and it was that tremble that made me catch the ball again off the rebound. What a sigh of relief I heaved with Fuard staring down on me.
For what Fuard did for the game; for the players , for the administration, and for his efforts to open the doors to outstation cricketers to become national stars, he certainly deserves legendary status. Above all he was man with sincere passion for help elevate Sri Lankan cricket to the global scene.
May the turf lie lightly over him!w

A(H1N1) virus fast spreading in Bibile
A(H1N1) virus is fast spreading in the Bibile area with around 30 patients being warded at the Bibile hospital.
A separate ward has been established to house the A(H1N1) patients, hospital authorities said.
The virus circulates throughout the year in all tropical countries. The routine pattern of the illness shows peaks of infection in November, December, January, May, and in June. The death of three patients at the Kandy General Hospital is an unfortunate incident. They were victims of unexpected complications. Therefore, generally the public has no reason to panic about an Influenza A(H1N1) spread.
According to Health Ministry Epidemiology Unit Consultant Virologist Dr. Samitha Ginige, elderly people over 65 years or children below two years, pregnant women, mothers in postpartum period, people with suppressed immunity and those with chronic diabetes, chronic obstructive airways disease, heart, liver, kidney and metabolic diseases should seek medical advice from a qualified practitioner to prevent complications.
Without panicking, the public needs to be vigilant. Some people develop complications very rarely. However, those who suffer from flu and feel short of breath or weakened health condition, should seek prompt treatments.

Animal health mobile clinics in Kilinochchi district from FAO
Under the Agro-Economic Development Project funded by the Government of Canada,the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in collaboration with Department of Animal Production and Health (DAPH) in the Northern Province has introduced animal health mobile clinics in Kilinochchi district to ensure good dairy management practices as well as to increase the milk production in the district.
FAOs initiative to provide mobile animal clinics provides assistance to the livestock sector to improve productivity, promote viable milk businesses and enhance contribution of the dairy sector to food and nutrition security and livelihoods for the livestock farmers in the district.
Thus far, mobile clinics were conducted in Skanthapuram, Uruthirapuram, Akkarajan, Mulankavil, Karanthai, Piramanatharaaru, Tharmapuram and Kalmadunagar and over 600 livestock farmers have benefited from these mobile clinics.
The dairy sector has great potential for further development in Sri Lanka and can constitute an effective way for farmers to diversify their livelihoods. The challenge they face is to keep their animals healthy and productive. FAO is very pleased to be working with the DAHP to bring the necessary expertise to the farmers through the mobile clinics said Nina Brandstrup, FAO Representative for Sri Lanka.
With the end of the conflict in the northern Sri Lanka in 2009, the livestock sector in the district was characterized by insufficient numbers of livestock and related assets, low productivity, a disorganized market for milk, shortage of dairy cattle, lack of breeding and related services, lack of grazing land, dearth of livestock feed and disorganized service and market networks.
We are indeed thankful to FAO and the Government of Canada for enabling this service. While providing us advice and expert guidance on quality forage feeding, artificial insemination, good dairy management practices, these newly established clinics extend animal health services to our doorstepsaid S. Kathirgamasamy, cattle farmer from Kilinochchi District.

Australian man trapped in dam with nose just above water

An Australian man has survived spending hours struggling to keep his nose above water after his excavator rolled into a waterhole.
Daniel Miller, 45, had been riding the machine at his remote property 300km (180 miles) north of Sydney.
When the edge of the dam gave way, the farmer was pinned down by a bar on the three-tonne excavator.
Miller said he adopted a yoga pose - arching his back for air - until a neighbour 500m away heard him shouting.
"I was trapped and had to keep my head up above water using my arms, I guess it was the cobra position," he told Sydney's Daily Telegraph.
"I'm not a yogi but I guess you could say yoga saved my life. That and the will to live."
Rescue crews said the ordeal on Tuesday lasted two hours, but Miller's wife, Saimaa, wrote on Facebook it was five hours.
Miller said he spent "the whole time" thinking about returning to his wife and their two young children.
Police chief inspector Neil Stephens said only Miller's nose and forehead were above the water.
"He's been extremely lucky to survive," inspector Neil Stephens said.
Firefighters drained some mud and water before wading in to free Miller.
"How he kept his back arched with his nose above the waterline was quite incredible for that amount of time," said Fire and Rescue New South Wales deputy captain Steve Howard.
'Sheer mental strength'
Miller was taken by helicopter to a hospital in the nearby city of Newcastle, where he was treated for hypothermia and minor back injuries.
"Dan is OK!" Millers wife wrote online.
"He was trapped... with the weight of his excavator on his back, and with the boggy dam ground below him slowly slipping away.
"It was literally sheer mental strength and determination to survive that got him through. As well as being fit, strong and healthy. Nothing to do with luck.
"Legendary effort from a legendary man."

Meanwhile, Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris appearing on behalf of the CID informed Court that a bail order issued by previous Magistrate enabling the accused to appear before Courts registrar once every three months instead of appearing before the CID last Sunday of each was an informal order and contrary to the general Court procedure.

Central Bank to raise Rs 2.5 bn from bond issue : Foreign reserves to reach US$ 7.5 bn by year end
The Central Bank has sought Cabinet approval to raise US$ 2.5 billion 2017 from a sovereign bond issue of US$ 1 billion and a syndicated loan of US$1.5 billion, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said yesterday.
With these fund inflows the country could expect its foreign reserves to reach US$ 7.5 billion by the end of this year, he said in Colombo yesterday.
The governor said the economy was responding to the stabilization measures adopted by the Central Bank and the government. However monitoring the macro economic developments was necessary in the period ahead before adopting further corrective measures, he said.
Coomaraswamy said the credit lending of the two state banks which stood at 30 percent plus and other banks 20 percent was alarming and was greater than they liked because it may undermine monetary policy transmissions. In 2016, the Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank had credit growth of 30 to 32 percent while private banks have reduced the rate below 20 percent.
He said the Central Bank will look into where the growth was coming from and the credit at state banks may be growing partly due to funding local contractors who were building roads. The governor said however that they did not intend to influence individual commercial decisions of banks.
Coomaraswamy said taking Lankas debt management out of the Central Bank was a decision in the correct direction because only a very few countries keep debt management under the purview of the Central Bank.
The Central Bank Monitory policy outlined that in January 2017 tourism earnings had increased by 12.9% to US$ 363.6 million. Workers remittances in December 2016 increased by 10.7% to US$ 684.6 million and for the period of January to December 2016 worker remittances had increased by 3.7% to US$ 7.2 billion The Sri Lanka rupee which depreciated by 3.8 % against the US Dollar in 2016 also had recorded a depreciation 0.6% this year up to February 7. The countrys Gross official reserves stood at US$5.5 billion in January 2017.

Ceylinco General Insurance records Rs. 16.1 bn premium income in 2016
Ceylinco General Insurance Ltd has recorded a premium income of Rs.16.1 billion (Rs.16,117 million) in 2016 with an impressive growth of 18.9%, which signifies an increase of Rs.2.5 billion over the previous year.
Announcing excellent results for the year ended December 31,2016, recording yet another exceptional year Ceylinco General Insurance Managing Director Patrick Alwis said last years performance was outstanding, and easily the best results recorded in the recent past.
The insurance arena is dynamic and fraught with stiff competition. Despite the price undercutting practiced by some players, customers have understood the value of Ceylinco VIP On The Spot.
We have worked hard and worked together, and we have surpassed expectations, once again. We have come out on top, and we remain committed to managing our business, exercising disciplined control and maintaining far-sighted leadership. As always, the most important focal point remains on our driving force - the customer.
Alwis said: Ceylinco General Insurance paid claims amounting to Rs. 10.4 billion during 2016, settling all genuine claims in the quickest possible time. This is an increase of 62% year on year. The sharp increase in claim settlement is a result of the large number of claims we paid,during the floods in May 2016. Claims were paid within a period of 14 days, enabling customers to return to normalcy in the fastest possible time.
Some of these customers had only insured their vehicles, but not their homes, while some had insured their shops, but not their houses. However, Ceylinco General Insurance, looking at the situation from a humane angle, decided to pay a percentage to compensate the damages to their homes as well.

Under this system, youth of the National Youth Council have been trained to educate the public and gather their views on the proposed new Constriction islandwide. This program has already been completed in seven districts. As a second step, we are educating political science teachers and their students on the Constitutional Reforms. They will be deployed to raise the awareness among the various segments in the society. The program has already been implemented in 12 districts, he said.
In addition, Civil Society members will be educated with the assistance of the Sarvodaya Organisation to create an awareness among the public on Constitutional Reforms. We will also educate public servants from next month.

Crab city for Hambantota, aquaculture industrial parks in Batticaloa, Mannar
The government is planning to create a Crab City in Hambantota in addition of setting up two aquaculture industrial parks in Batticaloa and Mannar districts, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
These projects are in line with the ambitious drive to double the export earnings from fisheries and aquatic resources by 2020.
Speaking at the Second International Ornamental Fish Trade and Technical Conference held in Colombo he said aqua culture parks in Mannar and Batticaloa will be on 3,000 and 2,000
acres of land respectively.The work on the Mannar industrial parkis slated to begin next month.
Sri Lanka is blessed with more than 10,000 internal reservoirs and some 116 lagoons and according to the Minister ,it has been suggested to develop the existing 116 lagoons while setting up several breeding centers in selected areas to develop aquaculture resources of fish species in high demand for export purposes.
Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage speaking at the event said the worlds ornamental fish industry is worth over US$ 3 billion with exports worth about US$ 300 million.
Sri Lanka is currently the sixth largest supplier of ornamental fish to the global market
He said developing countries account for 55% of total exports while 90% of the worlds demand for ornamental fish is met by farm fish and the rest is mainly by wild collected marine fish.
Sri Lankas ornamental fish industry has a 50 year history having started in 1952.Sri Lanka exports fresh water, brackish water and marine water fish species, marine invertebrates and aquatic plants.
Due to the overexploitation of the marine ornamental fish species, the government imposed some strict regulations to make sure the industry can be sustained while encouraging the farming of freshwater fish species, the Minister noted.
Although Sri Lankas main buyers for ornamental fish includes the USA, Japan, Hong Kong and the EU countries, Sri Lanka contributes less than 5% of the world demand. Therefore, Sri Lanka has a lot of opportunities and strength for the development of the ornamental fish industry,Gamage said.

Dazzling Du Plessis trumps spirited Sri Lanka
Cape Town: A career-best innings by Faf du Plessis trumped a thrilling century by Upul Tharanga as South Africa beat Sri Lanka by 40 runs in the fourth one-day international at Newlands on Tuesday.
Du Plessis hit 185, only three short of the South African ODI record, as South Africa piled up 367 for five.
It seemed as though Sri Lanka, who had been outplayed in the first three matches, would be on the end of another crushing defeat.
But Sri Lankan captain Tharanga hit a magnificent 119 off 90 balls and led his team's most spirited showing of the series. They were in with a chance of winning until a late slide in which they lost their last six wickets for 20 runs in 4.3 overs to be bowled out for 327.
"Faf played an exceptional knock," said South African captain AB de Villiers. "Tharanga also played a fantastic knock but there wasn't a lot of panic. I felt comfortable with the variety we had in our bowling."
Tharanga and fellow left-hander Niroshan Dickwella thrashed 100 runs in the first 10 overs on the way to a first-wicket partnership of 139 off 98 balls before Dickwella was caught on the midwicket boundary off Dwaine Pretorius for 58 off 47 deliveries.
Kusal Mendis (29) helped Tharanga add 64 for the second wicket as Sri Lanka stayed comfortably ahead of the required run rate until Wayne Parnell dismissed both batsmen. Tharanga, who was caught at backward point, hit 11 fours and seven sixes and left the field to a standing ovation.
"We needed to get a good start and it was a much better batting performance," said Tharanga. "Unfortunately we lost too many wickets later."
South Africa took full advantage of good batting conditions winning the toss.
Du Plessis made his runs off 141 balls and hit 16 fours and three sixes. He was caught at long-on off the first ball of the last over trying to clear the boundary with a hit which would have taken him past Gary Kirsten's long-standing South African best of 188 not out, made against the United Arab Emirates during the 1996 World Cup in Rawalpindi.
Du Plessis shared century partnerships with Quinton de Kock (55) and De Villiers (64).
"When you're feeling in good touch you've got to score big runs. That's my job," said Du Plessis, who said the partnerships with De Kock and De Villiers were crucial. "Quinny was striking the ball nicely and that took the pressure off me, then AB was brilliant running between the wickets."
Sri Lankan hopes flickered briefly when Hashim Amla was caught at first slip off Lahiru Kumara for one and South Africa were able to score only four runs in the first three overs.
But Du Plessis and De Kock quickly gained control, with the left-handed De Kock finding form for the first time in the series, reaching a half-century off only 40 balls as he and Du Plessis put on 100 off 87 balls for the second wicket
De Kock hit seven fours and two sixes in his 46-ball innings before he was caught at slip off left-arm spinner Sachith Pathirana.
Du Plessis and De Villiers added 137 off 122 balls for the third wicket before De Villiers missed a sweep against Pathirana and was bowled for 64 off 62 balls. He hit four fours.
Pathirana was Sri Lanka's most successful bowler, taking two for 55 and conceding only two boundaries in his 10 overs. AFP

Deshamanya R.K.W. Goonesekera was an inspiring teacher: CJ
Deshamanya R.K.W. Goonesekera was an inspiring teacher with a tremendous passion for his work. He was well-known for his ability to explain complex legal concepts and judicial decisions in relatively simple terms, Chief Justic K.Sripavan said.

He was a profound scholar,a distinguished member of the legal profession, a gentleman par excellence, an advocate for human rights, and a citizen of integrity and vision, Chief Justice Sripavan said.
Bar Association of Sri Lanka president Geoffrey Alagaratnam rememberd Goonesekera as a legend of the legal profession.
R.K.W. was not merely a great lawyer with a great legal mind. He was an academic, a scholar, and a jurist of exceptional calibre.
He demonstrated in his teaching career, both at the Peradeniya University and and as Law College Principal that he was an exceptional teacher. Above all, he was a genuine and sincere human being whose thought patterns were sound and strong, he said.
Human rights lawyer J.C. Weliamuna praised Goonesekera for his commitment to free speech and his respect for dissenting views: He encouraged dialogue between those who disagreed on certain issues, and he openly encouraged junior colleagues to discuss things openly with him, he said.

Education Ministry to end teacher shortage
The Education Ministry will recruit teachers to end the teacher shortage in schools, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
About 3,868 Physical Training Instructors will be recruited to end the shortage of PTIs in schools.
Meanwhile, 1,732 assistant teachers who are serving in rural schools will be recruited to the teachers service as Grade 3-11 teachers. As a remedy to end the Tamil medium teacher shortage, 3,202 retired teachers will be recruited on contract basis. About 1,093 graduates will be recruited to teach science and mathematics streams in Advanced Levels in National Schools. They will be recruited as Graduate Teachers to Grade 3-1 (A) of the teachers service.
Meanwhile, applications will be called from diploma holders and advanced level passed applicants to fill the teacher shortage in primary and secondary schools. Once the Education Ministry receives the approval of the State Services Commission, application process will be carried out. These teachers will be recruited on provincial basis.
Minister Kariyawasan said attention has been drawn on amending the teachers service minute after discussing with teachers' unions. He said assistant teachers' allowance will be increased from Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 10,000 aiming to evaluate their service, while obtaining the best outcome.
When the Minister was questioned by the media as to why the ministry does not concentrate on streamlining the school sport sector, he said the ministry has taken measures to streamline the school sport sector.
That is why we are going to recruit 3,868 PTIs to schools. Regional wise and zonal wise sport meets will be carried out again, he said.
The minister said teachers who are serving more than 10 years in the same national school will be transferred. Speaking on the SAITM issue, he said he is not against the private universities, but those universities should maintain quality standards. It is better to establish private universities in the country since it keeps billions of money in the country as students need not go abroad for higher education.
He said two more medical faculties will be established in Wayamba and Sabaragamuwa universities.

Eligible students to be admitted to Royal Grade One
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said qualified and suitable students in the waiting list will be recruited to Grade One of Royal College, Colombo in place of students whose admissions were halted following the forwarding of fraudulent documents.
The Minister said that it has been scheduled to complete the Grade 1 admission process by next week after selecting students from the second list (Waiting list).
He told the media that 31 children, whose parents had applied for Grade One admissions at Royal College allegedly using fraudulent documents, were de-listed.
The admissions to Grade One had been suspended after the Education Ministry received several complaints including a complaint from the Principal of the college itself to look into the alleged irregularities in the admission process. The Ministry then launched a special inquiry into the admission process on the advice of the Minister by appointing an inquiring committee.
The inquiry was launched after receiving several complaints about the irregularities that are alleged to have taken place in the admission process. We have investigated 147 addresses mentioned in the applications and have recovered 31 fraudulently prepared documents Minister Kariyawasam said.
He added the documents had addresses of several public places, security counters, religious places and business establishments.
On the recommendations of the inquiring committee, seven education officers allegedly involved in malpractices during the admission process were interdicted. These officials served on the interview board and the appeal board.
Minister Kariyawasam said that investigation relating Grade One admission process of other 15 schools is being held and the Ministry will take tough action against errant officers without considering their positions.

Epic Technology Group implements DAS system at Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Epic Technology group has re-energized the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a state-of-the-art eDocument Attesting System (e DAS).
This project was procured and managed under the leadership of the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA). Citizens of Sri Lanka who use this system will experience a new level of customer service like never before at the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
This new technology implementation at the Consular Department will enable citizens to get their source documents and certificates attested and certified within a maximum time span of 15 minutes, a process which used to take 6 -8 hours earlier.
The consular division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs serves on an average of 500 citizens per day who require attesting and certifying their documents.
The department examines and certifies 1200 to 1500 documents per day. With this new (eDAS) system, the general public would spend only a maximum time of 15 minutes at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while it reduces the cost of transaction to a bare minimum.
The second phase of enhancements to this system is already under consideration, where, with the enhancements, the citizens could even get prior appointments at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, if they intend to visit the consular division on a specific date to obtain their services by simply dialling 1995.
This fully integrated system will connect all major governmental institutions such as the Examinations Department, Department of Education, Department of Immigration & Emigration, Registrar of Persons Department, embassies, and foreign missions, etc. for real time verification and authentication of source documents within seconds.
Speaking at the launch of this National Service, Executive Chairman and Managing Director of Epic Technology Group Dr. Dehigama said I am proud that Epic Technology Group has been able to join hands with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the ICTA to deliver this superior state-of-the art solution, which will directly benefit the citizens of Sri Lanka.
This is a revolutionary solution that will touch the hearts of many citizens. I also would like to extend my gratitude to Dr. Harsha de Silva, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, who lead the project from the forefront pushing and guiding everyone towards the goal.
Also, the ICTA lead by Muhunthan Canagey played an extraordinary role in making this dream come true.
He added, we take pride in being a 100% home grown entity, and when our technology can benefit our citizens directly it makes me extremely honoured and proud. Hats off to the Epic Team for a wonderful job done.

Faith moving mountains
With God all things are possible.
Romans 8:31  If God is for us, who can ever be against us
Romans 8: 38  And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from his love. Death cant and life cant. The angels cant and the demons cant. Our fears for today, our worries about tomorrow, and even the powers of hell cant keep Gods love away..
The Apostolic Diocese of Ceylon (ADC) gathered the leaders of all its member churches for the inaugural meeting recently. The ADC hosted over 500 clergy, making it one of the largest pastors gatherings of Charismatic/ Pentecostal leaders nationally. The ADCs collective congregation is approximately 50,000 strong.
The Daily News attended this groundbreaking event.
It has been one and a half years since I took office as Chief Overseer of the Apostolic Diocese of Ceylon. It has been an inspiring, progressive and empowering journey for all the churches that came under our wing and joined as one under our revived mandate. My commissioning towards the thousands of independent churches in the country was envisioned on the dawn of 2013, and since then I opened my heart to heal, teach and cover those who wanted a spiritual father and leader, said Rev. Dr. Kirby de Lanerolle, Chief Overseer.
The ADC has now amassed 515 churches becoming the largest charismatic denomination in the country. De Lanerolle emphasized that 2015 marked the dawn of a new era for the free churches in Sri Lanka.
It was at this very prophetic season that we experienced, all things working together for the good of those that love him, who have been called according to his purpose (Romans 8:28), when the Indian National Apostolic Diocese concurrently mandated us to fulfil the very vision that had been birthed in our hearts.
We are the largest non  Catholic denomination in the North and East. The ADC episcopates a congregation of nearly 40,000 island-wide. The Charismatic churches in the country face challenges on different levels. This Diocese has identified four socio religious political areas that we are committed to work for 2017 -
 The challenges of the burial of the dead of a charismatic believer which has been challenged on many occasions unless a main line letter is submitted. We want to especially thank Law and Order Minister Sagala Rathnayaka for taking an interest and following through with an inquiry into this matter in the North and East.
 The challenge to upgrade and build the premises of our churches and worship centres.
 The challenge to be identified as clergy on our travel documents, official documents and our ID cards
 The challenge to place charismatic children in schools in the absence of a letter from a main line church.
The ADC is committed towards religious harmony and dialogue between religions, so that we can work in harmony towards serving a united nation through the multi religious and cultural communities that we are placed in.
It is important as members of the body of Christ that we emulate the heart of reconciliation within our own church body thereby reconciling the hearts of leaders within our own faith. The Church is divided into nearly 41,000 denominations worldwide with different doctrines and beliefs within the foundations of the Bible. Reconciliation between brethren and bridging the gaps through friendship and love should be of utmost importance in accordance with our faith, explained De Lanerolle.
Dr. Lakshman Madurasinghe, International President Medicina Alternativa and Ceylon Holistic Centre rendered a powerful speech saying that the Pastors have a great challenge but there are also great opportunities to serve in Sri Lanka.
We are multiracial, multi-religious and a multi-ethnic society, and naturally there will be many challenges that you will have to face as you go along. But the most important thing is that as you go along, the Lord is there to support you. More than all the plans that we can bring together it is the Lords guidance. And as you rely on him, you will be empowered to carry on your ministerial work. In 1John 2:27, we are told that the anointing will teach you everything. Nevertheless when Paul was writing to 2Timothy, in Chapter 2 it is said  to bring people who are faithful and able to teach and train them. He tries to identify that there are certain ministries  the fivefold ministries we have and to empower, teach and develop, and guide them systematically to be able to be of service in society, said Madurasinghe
Madurasinghe also touched on the areas of competency, commitment, character and consciousness, and their importance.
We have to develop our competence and we have to have a systematic way of building those competencies to face challenges, cross cultural issues, international connectivity and so on, stated Madurasinghe.
Madurasinghe urged followers to be committed to the church, committed to your pastors and leadership in order to be able to derive and gain the maximum.
For too long we have been scattered doing our own thing. Coming under an umbrella supports you, motivates you, encourages you and enlightens you. Character too is important. Many pastors in many parts of the world, have tried to do their own thing and deviating from that character that should be flawless in the presence of God and in the eyes of everybody. Christ consciousness is also vital. But this is not the consciousness spoken by these new age movements and doctrines! We have to be careful about that.
They believe you can advance to a level of consciousness ultimately as Christ Consciousness. We are not into developing that type of consciousness. We are talking about beholding as a mirror the glory of the Lord so that our image will be like his and that comes when you yield to the Lord! There is a lot of work to be done.
Much Bible reading to be done, a lot of areas to learn and equip so we carry on as completely competent soldiers in the vineyard of God, elucidated Madurasinghe.

Former Higher Education Minister S.B.Dissanayake revealed yesterday that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had allegedly contravened the University Grants Commission (UGC) to allow the Kotalawala Defence University (KDU) to start its own medical faculty.
I am personally against the methods that were used to get it approved,added the minister. Addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Parliamentary Complex,
he said that at the start, the UGC opposed the KDU accepting students to study medicine as the university was not under its direct supervision, We objected to it.
The UGC made it clear that the KDU had to comply with their regulations before it could approve students to its medical program.
But, Gota had llegedly brought in an Act of Parliament to register it separately.
It was then contrary to the Sri Lanka Medical Council Act so he went and amended that, Minister Dissanayake said.
The SLMC Registrar opposed it at first.The GMOA also remained quiet at that time- did not oppose at all. It all went through smoothly, explained the minister.

Maximum efforts will be made to prevent any doctors strike that could be planned in connection with the SAITM issue, Health Services Acting Director General Dr.Jayasundara Bandara said.
Unlike other professionals,
doctors cannot be imported or produced instantly. A few retired doctors is insufficient to provide services to the large number of patients,Dr.Bandara said.
Addressing a media seminar at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, Dr. Bandara said although the Government Medical Officers Association warned about taking trade union action, they have not launched a strike. Therefore,we are hopeful that no strike will take place.
Dr.Bandara said a doctors service cannot be done by anyone else. A labourer can be replaced but a doctor is irreplaceable. Nobody else can fulfill the role of a doctor. Even if retired doctors are recalled to serve, they cannot treat all patients in all hospitals.
Therefore, we will work to prevent any possible strike.The Pet scanner ordered for the Maharagama Cancer Hospital will be brought soon. The technical evaluations have already been completed.But, before that the Pet Scanner installed in the Colombo General Hospital must commence operations, he added.

However, during the period under review, we have seen increasingly challenging operating conditions across most sectors. Increasing VAT rates and the introduction of VAT at hospitals, new pharmaceutical pricing regulation and increasing inflation have impacted Q3 profitability.
In addition, we have seen higher sales and distribution costs incurred in Bangladesh as we grow our operations there. Further, we have experienced continued losses at our new hotel, Anantara Peace Haven Resort in Tangalle.
As a result, Q3 saw revenue growth of 14% and PAT growth of 1.9% over the corresponding period last year, Group Chief Executive Officer, Steven Enderby said.
We continue our efforts to enhance and develop the luxury travel market in Sri Lanka through our close relationship with Minor Group.
During the first nine months of the year under review, the Groups consumer sector delivered revenues of Rs.12.3 bn, a 10.1% increase over the previous financial year. Operating profits were Rs.1.7 bn, 22.9% YoY growth, whilst earnings grew at 29.8% to stand at Rs.1.4 bn.
Consolidated healthcare sector revenue stood at Rs.13.9 bn, a growth of 17.0%. Operating profit and earnings grew at 14.6% and 13.5%, to achieve Rs.1.5 bn and Rs.964 mn respectively. During the last quarter, healthcare sector experienced challenges arising from new pharmaceutical price
regulation and the introduction of VAT on specified hospital services.
J. L. Morison posted a YoY growth of 6.0% and operating profit growth of 1.3% for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. Our Rx Pharma portfolio continued to do well benefiting from new product launches.
Our Leisure, Travel and Aviation (LTA) business recorded total revenue of Rs.2.9 bn, reflecting 5.4% YoY growth for the first nine months. Hotels sector recorded a revenue growth of 2.8% over last year recording a topline of Rs.1.2 bn.

Morisons Gripe Mixture has been a trusted name for decades in Sri Lankan households as an infant Carminative Syrup. Although it has traditionally been the refuge of parents trying to assuage their babys stomach or bowel disorders, the mixture is an effective remedy to ease pain caused by acidity and flatulence for anyone.
The new Gripe Mixture for older children and adults will enrich this preparation with added natural ginger extract for more effective relief and a more definitive taste and experience. Gingers natural anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties will enhance the mixtures performance by helping to increase digestive juices, neutralize stomach acids and help relieve gastrointestinal irritation.

ICC Womens World Cup Qualifier: Lanka make short work of Irish
Brilliant half-centuries from Prasadani Weerakkody (61) and Dilani Manodara (53 n.o.) coupled with excellent bowling by off-spinner Inoshi Priyadarshani (3/21) gave Sri Lanka Women their first win in the ICC Womens World Cup qualifier tournament at the NCC grounds yesterday.
Batting first Sri Lanka racked up an impressive 239-8 and dismissed Ireland Women for a paltry 93 to record a convincing win following their defeat at the hands of India on the opening day on Tuesday.
Prasadani hit eight fours in her 81-ball knock and Dilani four fours in facing 60 balls.
Ireland were troubled by the spin cum pace combination the Lankan came up with and were all at sea with only two batters getting into double figures.

Importance of 60th anniversary of Sri Lanka-China diplomacy
On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and Peoples Republic of China, as the President of Sri Lanka-China Friendship Association (SLCFA), I am honoured to extend warmest wishes to our two peoples and the leadership of our two countries.
This important anniversary scheduled for February 7 is the greatest event within the diplomatic chronology of Sri Lanka during past six decades.
On February 7, 1957, S.W.R.D.Bandaranaike and Zhou Enlai, two Prime Ministers of Sri Lanka and China established official relations at Colombo, mutually holding hands of bilateral diplomacy and friendship. During the period of foregone 60 years, it was China who assisted us most, in economic, security, political and diplomatic fields without being second to any other country in the world. People of Sri Lanka will never ever forget the fact that the victory of the 30 year old separatist war would not have been successful in 2009, if not for assistance provided by China to our government.
Hence in May 2013, leaders of our two countries proclaimed the uplifting of relations to a Strategic Cooperative Partnership of Sincere Mutual Assistance and Everlasting Friendship in the official communique jointly issued. I take this opportunity to wish success to the Free Trade Agreement expected to be signed in China during the official visit of Sri Lankan Prime Minister in May this year, which would be a major foothold of 60 year old state to state diplomacy.

India axe triple centurion for Bangladesh Test
Hyderabad: India captain Virat Kohli insisted Wednesday that his record-breaking side werent taking their debut home Test against Bangladesh lightly -- despite dropping a batsman who scored a triple century on his last outing.
After going unbeaten in the last 18 Tests, Kohlis number one ranked team is widely expected to swat aside a Bangladeshi outfit that has never beaten top-notch opposition on their travels.
And after a 4-0 win over England in their last series, Indias confidence is so high they even feel they can drop rookie batsman Karun Nair, who scored 303 not out in the final Test in Chennai.
But Kohli, who has himself scored three Test double centuries since July, said there was no danger of the worlds top-ranked Test team becoming complacent.
No team is invincible, no team is unbeatable, he said, ahead of the one-off match in Hyderabad which starts on Thursday.
We have been able to win games because of persistence by the bowlers, application by the batsmen, coming back from tough situations.
Kohli did not reveal his line-up, but made clear that fit-again Ajinkya Rahane would return in place of Nair who has a Test average of 160 after scoring an unbeaten 303 against England in December.
One game doesnt overshadow two years of hard work from another player. You need to understand what Jinks (Rahane) has done for the team over the past two years, Kohli said.
He averages almost fifty in this format and he is probably the most solid batsman in the Test team. He deserved to walk back into the team whenever he got fit. Karun was stepping into his shoes and what he did was remarkable, but sealing his spot as far as the squad was concerned is what Karun did.
Kohli is well aware of the dangers of India getting carried away after the home favourites were knocked out of last years World Twenty20 at the semi-final stage by the unfancied West Indies.
During the same tournament, India only just scraped home in their match against Bangladesh in the last ball of the game.
India also lost a one-day series in 2015 on a tour of Bangladesh, while a one-off Test was drawn after being disrupted by rain.
We are wary of their ability and the talent that they bring to the table, Kohli told reporters.
This weeks match marks the first time that Bangladesh have been invited to play a Test in India since they won Test status in 2000.
While Bangladesh did manage to beat England for the first time in Test cricket in Dhaka last year, their struggles away from home were once again underlined by two subsequent defeats in New Zealand.
Bangladeshi skipper Mushfiqur Rahim said the tourists were excited by the prospect of taking on the best in the world in an historic match. It is a great opportunity to show some character and show our ability and hopefully we can match up with the top side, said the wicketkeeping batsman.
We played really well against England and individually we played well against New Zealand... Although we lost the last two Tests (there were a) lot of positives coming from those two games. AFP

Kandy Sports Club  League kings for record 18th time
Kandy Sports Club have retained the Dialog A division league championship for yet another year with one more match to play against bottom of the table CH&FC the following week which will be of academic interest.
Kandy SC playing 24 carat gold rugby recorded their sixth win in a row win in the second round league to set a new league record by winning the trophy for the 18th time. They had earlier won in 1994, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2015 and 2016.
The Kandy players made the hill capital proud and especially their godfather Malik 'Mr. Ruby' Samarawickrema who has been the cornerstone of their victory. Despite his onerous duties as minister he still found time to come and watch his ruggerites perform which inspired the team and the players.
In a tough league competition Kandy earned the top spot when the team grew in stature after early hiccups and competed admirably at the highest levels of competition.
The defending champions stunned Havelock SC 26-11. As game it served as a microcosm of Kandys improvements, be it in adversity, the dominant set-pieces or the clinical way they finished off their four tries.
Havelock SC took the field with dreams of completing the season with high hopes and winning the title, but all their hopes went up in smoke as Kandy SC tore them into shreds playing some amazing and eye catching rugby. Havelock were terrible in the first 40 minutes, but in the second half they were hanging on by their skins. Although the Park club had home advantage of playing under lights with master tactician Ronnie Ibrahim the coach guiding the team well this year, all this went astray as Kandy showcased a powerful performance to win the game convincingly.
Shehan Pathirana played extremely well for Kandy with his individual brilliance. He has grown as a rugby player and a person and has developed his game incredibly well. After the amazing teamwork and good thinking, Kandy players made the hill capital proud and fire crackers were lit in the town when victory was achieved and the trophy won.
The Park club started out strong scoring three points off penalties within the games opening six minutes and never looked back, using strong options passing the ball with good defensive tactics to dominate throughout the first half. A good passage of play was observed but they failed to add points on the score board. The second half continued as normal and Kandy took control of the game and blocked all passages not allowing the Park club free of handling of the ball.
Kandy SC hit back in the back-end of the game with Havelocks mistakes ruining the home team's chances. In the second half Kandy SC were much better than Havelocks in many areas, and the strength of this side was in their fitness, co-ordination and ability to play under pressure. Kandy SC gave it their best shot in the second half with some intelligent rugby; they completed their job by scoring four tries, a penalty and a drop kick. The score would have been higher if the conversions and penalties were converted. Thilina Wijesinghe had an off day with his boot and he was able to convert only two out of the nine opportunities he got to kick at goal. Kandy SC team will now be at peace having totally fulfilled their potential and becoming the first club to win the tile the highest number of times in Sri Lanka.
Senior players such as Fazil Marija, skipper Roshan Weeraratne, Gayan Weeraratne, Kishore Jehan, Richard Dharmapala, Sashika Jayawardene, Nigel Ratwatte, have formed the backbone of this team for more than a half a decade. They are great players and outstanding men. Kandy SC has reached peak form at the right time after a poor start and now the sky is the limit.
Its a pleasure to see them play as a combined unit with considerable power, co-ordination, and good control, discipline, kicking and navigating the team superbly and dropping another game-changing goal to bury the disappointments of previous games.
All players contributed extremely well towards the success of the team, notably the highest try scorer Dhanuska Ranjan, Richard Dharmapala, Thilina Wijesinghe was a great asset for the team with his kicking ability. The other players worthy of mention for their contribution are Shehan Pathirana, Vishwamithra Jayasinghe, Buwanaka Udangamuwa and Gayan Ratnayake actually the entire team should be applauded for their fine performance Kandy SC also has the luxury of a fantastic bench of players as replacements. The coach Sean Wijesinghe and the Rugby Committee should be considered the best for the decade for guiding the team to reach great heights this rugby season.

As protests held by the residents of Keppapilavu, Mullaitivu continue for the tenth consecutive day, the military has asked that the protesters outside the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) camp show proof of ownership for the land.
Military Spokesperson, Brigadier Roshan Seneviratne addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing yesterday said that he had been informed that the land in question belonged to the government under the Forest department and it was not private land, We have informed them that if they prove their ownership to the land through the divisional secretariat, the Air Force would take that into consideration and release whatever land that is possible to be released, said Brigadier Seneviratne.
The families together with their children however continue to protest and around 84 Tamil families claim ownership to around 20 acres of land on which the SLAF camp is situated on. If they continue to protest despite our assurances, it is clear that they are operating on a separate agenda. It is also strange that they did not lay claim to this land for the past eight years but have now come to claim them,the Brigadier said.

Kiriella warns SLMC: Abide by court ruling
Will seek courts intervention:
Students cannot be held hostage to the whims of GMOA, SLMC :
Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday said the government would comply with the court ruling on SAITM and warned that if the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) did not adhere with a court ruling to register students from SAITM, they would have to be taken to courts.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Parliamentary Complex, the minister stressed that the students cannot be held hostage to the whims of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) and the SLMC.
The GMOA and the SLMC which had been strongly opposed to the private medical college have reasoned that the institution was not up to standard and that the medical students did not receive adequate clinical training to qualify as competent doctors.
A court ruling in 2015 allowed the students to receive their clinical training from the Awissawela Base Hospital and Kaduwela MOH but Kriella said that the students are yet to benefit from this due to intimidation from the GMOA.
We will intervene in future with the help of the courts to ensure that the students receive proper clinical training. Dr Neville Fernando has also offered his hospital to the government on a private-public partnership, said the Minister.
He explained that he had met SLMC, Chairman, Dr Carlo Fonseka last year and asked that the SLMC grant registration to the students who were completing their studies at SAITM if they were to pass the ACT 16 exam but Dr Fonseka had refused to consider such a request, Now the courts have asked that they be registered without a common exam, said Kiriella.
He added that if the SLMC agreed, the government was prepared to appeal to the courts to include the ACT 16 exam for SAITM students.
Former Minister of Higher Education, S.B. Dissanayake who also addressed the media pointed out that only 40 percent of students qualifying for medicine from the state universities were taken on merit basis, 55 percent enter through the district quota system. This means that students in remote areas could also enter the medical faculty with three passes, said Dissanayake.
Every year 300 students who receive three As from major towns dont get the opportunity to do medicine. They need a place to go and they can be given scholarships, he added.
In a scathing attack on the GMOA and SLMC, the minister said ; The GMOA are opposed to everything. When we wanted apothecaries to have the opportunity to become doctors, they were opposed to it, when nurses wanted degrees, they opposed. They are very hypocritical.
According to the former and present ministers of Higher Education, the government has been trying its best to attract international universities to set up medical and other campuses in the country but the persisting issue at Malabe has put them all off.
We need competition between universities, it is then that they would improve,Kiriella said as Dissanyake added, Just because you open a private university, our state institutions will not fall apart. We have 4,31,000 children studying in international schools at present and they all cannot afford to go abroad. The government has to find them universities too.
The government this year will start construction on two new medical faculties in the universities of Wayamba and Ruwanpura. They have also signed a MoU with Manipal university in India to set up a local campus.

Lanka worries about Indian Trojan horse

For decades before and after Sri Lankas independence in 1948, Indias relations with the island nation were political and adversarial.
But since the second half of the 1990s, there has been a gradual shift to trade, development assistance and investment, in that order.
While India has been wanting to build bridges with Lanka, veering from two decades of exclusive involvement with the intractable Tamil question, the latter has been exploring government-to-government economic tie-ups with India.
The ice was broken in the mid 1990s when an India-friendly Chandrika Kumaratunga became president on the promise of a rapprochement with Tamils (including the LTTE), and also friendship with India which had backed the Tamil demand for autonomy and imposed the India-Sri Lanka Accord in 1987 to bring it about.
Quick negotiations led to the IndiaSri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISLFTA) in 1999. What followed was a remarkable increase in bilateral trade, set to reach $5 billion now.
Though the balance of trade is heavily in Indias favour, Lankas exports to India grew from a minuscule $58 million in 2000 to over $600 million in 2015-16, thanks to the agreement.
Indias exports to Lanka are much higher at $4 billion, but 70 per cent of it lies outside the FTA. Indias assistance portfolio in Lanka is now nearly $2.6 billion, out of which $436 million is in the form of grants. Even its loans are cheap coming at an interest of 1.75 per cent.
Taking the money spent and pledged together, India has extended to Lanka $1 billion for rebuilding its decrepit railways.
The 50,000 houses for war-affected Tamils and poor Indian-origin Tamils cost India $270 million. Recently, India gave $20 million for rainwater harvesting in the dry Northern Province; $7.5 million was given for a free ambulance service.
Indian FDI in Lanka totals over $500 million. India has pledged to set up a 500 MW LNG-powered plant at Kerawalapitiya.
Indian companies want to invest in the East Container Terminal at Colombo port and the Trincomalee port hinterland development.
Indian trans-shipment accounts for 70 per cent of the earnings of the Colombo port which is sustaining the loss-making Chinese- built Hambantota port. However, Indias economic engagement with Lanka has not been an unmixed blessing.
Fear of economic domination by the Big Brother has replaced the earlier fear of political and military dominance. Sri Lankans argue that Indias Non-Tariff Barriers have greatly restricted their exports under the FTA.
Fears of an influx of Indian professionals stopped the signing of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement at the last minute. Agitators are now threatening to scuttle talks on Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) though India ruled out movement of natural persons.
Despite an assurance that almost all employees of the $7.5 million Indian ambulance service would be Lankans, it was seen as a Trojan Horse of RAW.
India was disappointed when the 500 MW coal-fired power plant project at Sampur was called off after six years of talks. As a compensation for its ouster from Sampur, Colombo said India could set up an LNGbased 500 MW power plant in Kerawalapitya, but it is not known if the offer would stand in the months to come.
In violation of an India-Sri Lanka 2003 agreement, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) has been trying to take over three of the 99 oil tanks in Trincomalee given to the Lanka Indian Oil Corporation (LIOC) for 35 years.
The CPC says it needs the tanks to store diesel for use in power plants. The LIOC is ready to provide the facilities as a joint project, but that is not acceptable to the CPC.
Late last month, the Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises threw a bombshell by saying that since the LIOC had not signed the lease agreement relating to the tanks within the stipulated six months, Lanka should take over all the 99 tanks.
But LIOCs case is that the 2003 pact does not mention the need for a lease agreement, that the LIOC has been paying the stipulated annual leasing fee of $100,000 to the government regularly, and that the local land records show that the owner of the land is the LIOC.
Two Indian firms which were to lead an international consortium to build the Colombo ports East Terminal (as per the wishes of the Lankan government), are now out in the cold because Lanka suddenly said the criteria would be revised.

Nilakshi Parndigamage
Nilakshi Parndigamages story is one of success  a dream realized. Strong-willed and determined, she showed signs of promise very early on in her life and subsequently attended Yale. She was recently appointed the Dean of Ezra Stiles, one of the undergraduate colleges of Yale University. Outstanding Personalities features Nilakshi Parndigamage, who is certainly living up to her potential.
Q. Your entire education in Sri Lanka was at Visakha Vidyalaya, where you were also appointed the Head Prefect in 2000. How do you think your time at Visakha helped you later in your higher studies and in your career
A. I received a world-class education at Visakha. I say world class without any hesitation because it is Visakha that prepared me for my academic and professional careers. In addition to the academic aspect, the school also taught me that it is the most natural thing in the world to befriend, love, respect, and work with those who were different to me; treating everyone with compassion and respect. Perhaps it was the influence of Buddhism because we were reminded daily that we needed to be mindful of our thoughts, words, and actions because they ultimately have the power to affect others and the world around us. I am deeply indebted to some of my teachers, who had a knack for keeping me grounded and teaching the importance of humility. I know that what I gained from the school has shaped who I am and continues to influence decisions I make on a daily basis.
Q. Yale is one of the highest ranked and most competitive universities in the world. You attended Yale on a full scholarship and were a student leader on campus who was very involved in several student organizations. Can you describe some of your activities while you were a student
On her wedding day
A. I have been very fortunate to have been influenced by wise and caring teachers, professors, mentors, and bosses. I was a member and later the President of the Center for Buddhist Life at Yale. The university had a considerable population that identified themselves as Buddhists. I met a lot of people from around the US and the world. Some had a formal education in Buddhism and others were more focused on practicing the Dhamma. It was a wonderful group. In the aftermath of the tsunami, we organized an overnight pirith ceremony - the first of its kind at a Yale - bringing in monks from various countries who were based in the US to chant overnight. Members of the Yale community from all over the world gathered in solidarity at the pirith ceremony. It was tough to be so far from home during that time, but it was remarkable to witness that pouring of love and support.
Q. Can you speak a bit about your academic interests while at Yale
A. I majored in Political Science and wrote my thesis on the difficulty of prosecuting sexual violence perpetrators in international war crimes tribunals. During my four years at Yale, I chose to study a lot about the rise of nationalism in various countries such as Germany, the former Yugoslavia, and Rwanda, and explored the mechanisms adopted by various post-war countries in reconciling the horrors of civil war. I was awarded a fellowship to work at the Yugoslavia War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague for a summer, which was a fascinating work experience. The tribunal was prosecuting those who carried out wartime rape, and I was interested in studying how difficult it is to prove wartime sexual violence in a court of law. That led me to my thesis topic. I went back to work at the tribunal after I graduated from Yale.
Q. Why the fascination with civil wars
A. I honestly did not know how to not study the topic. Having grown up in Sri Lanka and having experienced the war second-hand as a Colombo-resident, I was used to the single narrative of why the war came about and how we should not question history as it was written down in our text books. After I arrived at Yale, I had the option of really digging deep and studying about other countries that had similar civil war narratives. I realized just how similar and flawed all our narratives were.
Q. You have won many awards while representing Sri Lanka at various public speaking contests around the world, and also after you moved to the US. At your Yale graduation, you were one of three students from the entire university who was awarded the David Everett Chantler Award for exemplifying the qualities of courage, strength of character and high moral purpose. What was this award about and how did you feel upon receiving it
A. I had done a lot of academic work on human rights and civil wars, had worked at the Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal as a student, and had done a lot of work with the homeless population in New Haven and with the Buddhist Center. I believe it was in recognition of all that engagement.
Q. After your time at Yale and in The Hague, you pursued a career in law and ended up in Baghdad and later in a high-level corporate law firm in New York and Washington, D.C. Can you describe some of those experiences
A. I attended the University of Virginia School of Law which is located in Charlottesville, Virginia where I obtained my juris doctor degree. I did human rights advocacy work while in law school and worked at the International Center for Transitional Justice in South Africa for a summer. After law school, I worked for an organization based in Washington D.C., where I helped advise Iraqi parliamentarians on how to re-draft some of their legal codes to better protect religious minorities.
Nilakshi with her family
This was at a time in Iraqs recent history when the violence was relatively low, and there was genuine interest and hope expressed by Iraqi lawmakers who wanted a set of legal codes that would better adhere to their international treaty obligations. I worked there for a year before joining an international corporate litigation firm in New York. I worked at the firm for almost five years, first in their office in New York City and then in Washington, D.C., specializing in complex commercial litigation involving big U.S. and multi-national companies. It was very different from my previous work in the human rights field, but I didpro bono work to keep my sanity!
Q. You now serve as the Dean of Ezra Stiles College at Yale University where you preside over a college of 500 Yale undergraduate students. What does your job entail
A. I am thrilled to be back at Yale. I loved the inclusiveness and intellectual curiosity that was pervasive at Yale when I was a student, and I am happy to say not much has changed since then. Ezra Stiles is one of the twelve undergraduate colleges at Yale, and I serve primarily as the main academic adviser to Stilesians who study various subjects in the sciences, arts, and humanities. I love my job because, in addition to advising students on their studies, I also get to counsel them through whatever challenges they undergo during their four years at Yale. In addition to my duties as the Dean, I will be teaching a class in the Political Science Department at Yale next year. My days are busy but never the same, and I like the unpredictability that comes with the job. I am fortunate to live with my family in the Deans residence inside Ezra Stiles College. We enjoy being a part of a very diverse community, and I especially appreciate getting to work with thoughtful and smart students.
Q. How do you stay connected to Sri Lanka
A. My heart and soul will always be Sri Lankan. My parents, extended family, and best friends still live in Colombo, and I dont think I go half a day without talking to some of them. I get involved in various social justice projects from time to time, which keeps me connected to those who are not family or friends in SL. I have been fortunate to have returned home to Sri Lanka every year since I first left in 2002, and I hope to continue that tradition even though it gets a bit tougher once your family starts growing.
My son Gihan is bi-lingual and loves eating rice, parippu, and pappadam. While his childhood is definitely different to the one I had, he still benefits from some important aspects of having a Sri Lankan parent (like getting to eat a lot of Lankan food at home!). I do not need to make a special effort to stay connected to SL  thankfully, its a natural extension of who I am.

Light up your home
Lighting in your home is one of those items that you dont always notice when it has a good presence and feeling when youre in the space. Although, when the lighting is poor and you are trying to perform a task, or you feel the opposite of how you would like to feel in the space, you notice it immediately. Lighting is for ambiance, aesthetics, tasks, and seeing better in your home. Think about your home and if it has all the lighting qualities you would like. If your answer is no, here are some tips on how to choose the perfect lighting for you and your family.
Provide lighting for safety and security on the exterior of your home:
Walkways, sidewalks, perimeter of your house, and the front entry should be lit with ambient lighting. Too dim of lighting on the exterior is a welcome sign for intruders. While too bright of exterior lighting is costly and disturbing to neighbors. Consider installing flood lights at the exterior corners of your home that are motion activated to further deter intruders. Follow the aesthetics and security lighting of your neighborhood for further guidelines as to what to implement at your own home.


Use exterior wall sconces for dcor:
Outdoor lighting doesnt have to only be utilitarian. Wall sconces can provide washes of light against the exterior walls of your home to create ambiance in the evening hours. Directional sconces pointing upwards or downwards can focus on architectural elements on your home, and draw attention to exterior niches and plantings around your home.
Inside your home use multiple light sources for one space:
For rooms like the kitchen, bedrooms, and living spaces, multiple light sources will help you achieve a variety of functions and activities in that space. In the kitchen, under counter lights can provide great task lighting. While in a living room, opt for a floor lamp next to a couch or favorite reading chair. In bathrooms the lighting at the mirror should be free from shadows and glaring light.
For high ceilings and modern dcoruse recessed lighting:
Can light fixtures, so called because of the metal recessed can that is inserted into the ceiling and the light fixture fits inside. These fixtures are subtle and can be directional, and can be connected to dimmer switches to give a range of light from subtly dim to full brightness to illuminate an entire room.
In nurseries and kids rooms, remember night lighting:
Think about the lighting for when children sleep when planning lighting requirements. Night lights can help small children from being scared, but can also help parents navigate through dark rooms. For nurseries consider a dim wall sconce, or table lamp that can be used for changing diapers, or rocking infants to sleep.
In formal living and dining areas, research chandeliers wisely:
In spaces that a formal chandelier is considered, choose one that will not date your space. Often times chandeliers are bought without thinking of the space and the dcor that surrounds it. Chandeliers come in extremely simple designs that include faux candles, small bulbs, or a few lights to the ornate and expensive crystal varieties. Whichever is your dcor choice, measure out the space, and ceiling height before ordering to ensure enough head room will be available below the hanging chandelier.
Dont be afraid when choosing lighting for your home, it can help your ambiance and mood in the space. If you need lighting help ideas get inspiration from lighting stores, catalogs, and online decor and fashion blogs/magazines. Just like the color of your rooms, lighting should enhance your space and make it feel warm and inviting!
Determine what your lighting goals are:
Direct or task lighting is focused in the space you are trying to work. Ambient or indirect lighting is used for ambiance and for overall lighting of a space. Once chosen you can begin to choose lighting options. Each room in your home should have a mood you want to set, as well as a function you want your lighting to serve. (freshome)

ABM Ceylon Limited is a partnership between Brown & Company PLC (Browns), and Exide Industries India, and Browns has had the privilege of being the sole distributor for Exide, Lucas and Dagenite automotive batteries in Sri Lanka.
This award is of special significance, as last year too ABM was granted the Merit award under the same category. Winning the National Quality Award in 2016, is a strong testament of the companys unstinted strife towards quality and excellence, said M. Ramachandran, CEO ABM Ceylon Limited.
Exide is a long standing and well-known brand in the automotive industry, currently being sold in over 90 countries around the world. It is the only battery to carry the SLS Certification, built to JIS Standards, offering up to 5 years warranty, coupled with a strong island-wide dealer network and BattMobile services; a value add to Fully Loaded Exide products and services.
Lucas was established in 1872, the same year that the petrol engine was first patented. The business that Joseph Lucas founded in Birmingham, represents the consistency and durability of Lucas products and has made Lucas one of the most successful automotive brands in history. These batteries are manufactured in Sri Lanka under UK standards.
Dagenite is an All Terrain Battery manufactured in Sri Lanka. Dagenite automotive batteries are suitable for cars, vans, three wheelers, buses, Lorries or any other land vehicle and are priced more competitively than any other competitor brand in the market, making this the ideal battery option for the price conscious consumer.

Media harassment at ICC Womens WC qualifiers
The ICC womens World Cup qualifiers that commenced in Sri Lanka to select four teams for the big event in England next June continues as an event that is not worthy of its name as an ICC status tournament when considering the facilities extended to the media personal.
Even though this is an international event, only one overseas journalist from India is present at the venues to cover the matches. The facilities provided to all media personal were very unsatisfactory.
According to the SLC sources they are not engaged with the organizing of this ICC event and the representative of ICC, Rajasekhar Rao, the officer in-charge of media personal was vehemently criticized for his inefficiency to provide facilities for media men. Being an experienced media-man Raos step-motherly treatment has not gone down well with the local media.
On the opening day, local photo journalists were not allowed to cover the matches inside the grounds and asked to capture pictures of the event from outside the ground. Due to this restriction only a few media-men were present to cover the match between Sri Lanka and India on Wednesday.

Munchee Samaga Gamata Sarana celebrates 100th project
Munchee, the flagship brand of Ceylon Biscuits Limited recently celebrated the completion of its 100th milestone project at Wavegama Kanishta Vidyalaya in Sooriyawewa, Embilipitiya.
The company donated a mathematics lab, which was equipped with desks, computers, books, learning tools and materials that will now aid the students in their efforts to become more confident young learners and mathematicians.
The lab is also the most complete and well-resourced facility of its kind in the Sooriyawewa area, and is part of Munchee's long-term efforts to support the needs of local communities and the education of youth across the island.
As pioneers in corporate social responsibility, Munchee and CBL take great pride in implementing sustainable business practises across the group's operations, which provide local communities with basic needs and support at a grass-roots level.
The Munchee Samaga Gamata Sarana project was initiated in 2010 and in just six years; the project has successfully completed 100 need-based initiatives that have uplifted the lives of children, youth and community members across the nation. Munchee Samaga Gamata Sarana is a continuous village outreach and community development initiative that carries out activities in all parts of Sri Lanka every year.
Commenting on the completion of the school's math lab, W.A.K Wijenayaka Principal said, We are extremely grateful that Munchee and CBL filled this void in the local community, by helping us to build a mathematics lab for our students.
Commenting on the project Theja Peiris - Group General Manager Marketing, Ceylon Biscuits Limited said: The Munchee team recognized the importance of this project as mathematics is an important GCE O-Level subject. We were really touched as parents, students and school teachers all came together and did whatever they could to ensure that the project was completed on time. We are truly proud to have successfully completed our 100th project since Munchee Samaga Gamata Sarana was launched."
The Munchee Samaga Gamata Sarana projects, which are conducted by the Munchee sales team with the participation of local officials and community members, strengthen stakeholder relationships and help Munchee to forge lasting bonds with multiple communities.
The project has invested Rs. 34 million to date in communities across Sri Lanka, helping over 100,000 people in need. The first project was launched in Walagama, Kegalle where Munchee built a secure bridge over a deep stream to replace a make-shift log bridge that school children were using and elders were struggling to cross.
The new bridge offered a safer option for the community and both school children and elders in need of medical treatment were able to travel over the stream with ease.
Another similar bridge was constructed over a railway line in Ratnapura, to ensure that young students could travel to school safely.
Munchee and CBL have a dynamic sales force and they have served as the key drivers of the MGSG project, taking the passion, commitment and spirit of the Munchee brand to Sri Lankans young and old, across the entire expanse of the island.
It is through this project that the Munchee team has strengthened the brand's legacy as a leader in CSR, sustainability and consumer care and engagement.

The nature of survival and success!
The time has indeed come ...many a walrus will grin and all of us islanders, cloaked in anticipation as the Dialog league finally concludes. Survival has been the name of the game and the definition of measured performance from the first kick-off back in November 2016. Kandy, Havelocks, Navy and CR likely contenders from their early season form ...but eventually turned out to be lulled into a false sense of security for us fans and team supporters.
Navy certainly looked for that step up and a chance to push the bigger teams out of the way ...and for 80% of the league lived upto expectations, especially beating the defending champions Kandy in the first round and spinning the wheel of fortune their way. But it was desperately short lived and whatever ambition the Navy had.....soon evaporated.
Would have been exquisite prospect for CR, Havies and Kandy ...to fight for the title and write their own history...
The potential to be creative and ability to react under pressure....pretty much the decisive factor, between all teams.
CR on the other hand never really looked the part, or did their business.with any conviction ....result ....tough reality and just about living up to their potential in the premier division ...interesting to see if they change their combination, for the knock outs.
Driving the badge of courage and flying the traditional club flag, was the old guard and vastly improved Havelocks, whose team performance gave them the best possible opportunity to win the league title. Coach Ronnie Ibrahim defiant about proving his skills, inspiring the team and out thinking Kandy, then grabbing the league cup back to clubhouse in Colombo.
Lets try to nudge some additional performance in the knockouts ...the complex nature of rugby gives them plenty of time to decidethe pressure is that the player can be made to react differently.
Knockouts are totally different and anything is possible, given what we have already seen ...Havies can muscle up for a repeat in the knockouts and still feel confident about some silverware ...this month.
Kandy added their own drama by dropping two games in round 1....they spent the 2nd round a lot more focussed and with purpose ...brushing aside all and sundry,
Leading that fight for Havelocks is Dulaj Perera, whose form with ball and anything else, rugby related ...is nothing short of phenomenal ... 171 points from his trusted right boot as he commands respect and nearly had the cup back at the park.
Many will be contemplating how to support the frame.....and outfox Kandy to the next cup title....same team but little fitter, more confident and perhaps their own system of delivering despite the injuries ....with the error of margin so close ...its really a small fact that will change the nature of this re-clash and a 2nd title to grab some headliners.
Rugby needs another serious contender or two, to match up to Kandy on every level in the middle ...that way we are able to enjoy the highest level of skills, fitness, power, passion and strategy in the middle.
People talk about the brand of rugby played here in Sri ...its a jealously guarded and heavily protected virtual reality that pops up around this time of our rugby season, and gets the purists all fired up about the order of things etcneedless to say, the brand of rugby and our resident experts hallowed opinionglorious fiction!
But the stubborn reality, is that we need to set our sights on this most needed brand of island rugby ...then intravenously administer to the coaches and performance staff so our squads are graded on this particular skill set, most important ...the mind for more.
England coach Eddie Jones gave his bench on Saturday for the opening RBS 6 Nations against France - massive compliments for a job well done he said Englands win was an ugly one and the W was vital.
Most significantly it was the step up from skipper Hartly, the likes of Itoje and Daly who kept the marauding French at bay ...England were lucky to scrape home on the final whistle 19-16 and will take the ugly win with open arms, especially considering 7 injuries to their regulars like Vunipola x 2, Tuilangii, Robshaw, Haskell, Kruis etc. The Lions tour down under putting more pressure on the regulars to have recovered in time to make the cut.
Scotland on the same note sniffed past an in form Ireland 27-22, and shocked the RBS platform 2017 ...it was an equally hard graft 80mins with some lung busting loose work that confronted the mighty Irish boiler house to a grinding halt.
The pundits must be well intimidated and forecast suitable caution with speculation for the rest of the 6 Nations.
Wales have their work cut out and will need some magical performance upgrades to get past England, France and Scotland over the next 2 months RBS 6 Nations schedule.
Breaking news on the schools rugby season being pushed back by another month to accommodate ground availability...cricket big matches...and most significantly of all...a possibility of new partners for title sponsorship of this incredible Sri asset ...and easily the most popular sport in Sri Lanka second only to international one-day and T20 cricket ...protection for this platform is vital and fortuitous.
We wait with abated breath for the schools association announcement and acceptance of their new partnership with Singer PLC or Dialog Axiata PLC...a massive step for the school game and an assured future for our Asian and Commonwealth Games platforms.
Biggest hand to Kandy for clawing their way back and showing that quality in your squad and on your bench is a massive performance asset ...and gives the coach such flexibility and confidence that can break the opposition.
Kandy tore the 2nd half up with Danushka Ranjan power and skills that separates him from all three quarters in Sri rugby ...he is a sensation and plenty petrol too.
Finally add super substitute Sooriyabandara for 6 mins to full time and his scintillating pace from some dull ruck ball inside his own 22metres ...to pure space down the right touchline past all defenders and just Kutty Dixons desperate cover tackle ...to stop the try failed. Full time icing on the cake and a mesmerized stadium that held their breath till Sooriya B flew over the line - his talent and skills the next level of exceptional and vastly underutilized up at their Nittawela champions cauldron.
Blessings rugby hearts ...prepare to absorb the intense knockouts starting shortly...bula bula a new champion club in the making!

OMP cannot enter into own agreements
Amendments approved by the Cabinet this week will not allow the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) to enter on its own into agreements with any person or organisation to help achieve its mandate. The amendments proposed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe sought to repeal paragraph (a) of article 11 of the Missing Persons Act No 14 of 2016.
Paragraph (a) of Article 11 states that, The OMP shall have the following general powers- (a) to enter into agreements, as are necessary to achieve the mandate of the OMP, with any person or organization.
The Office of Missing Persons was authorised through an Act of Parliament in August of 2016 but the office responsible for tracing those missing during conflict is yet to be established.

Opening windows
In architecture, comparisons between then and now are inevitable. Also, we cannot help but imagine what life will be like in the future. As human beings, we question our environment. In doing so, we also contemplate on the kind of changes that will take place and have taken place. This is necessary for growth. Without comparing, we cannot grow. Archworld meets up with architect Asanga Samarasekara to discuss footsteps in the sand.
The Egyptian pyramids and massive reservoirs built by ancient kings, great ancient creations such as Sigiriya are definitely timeless creations. The sky scrapers and massive construction that we experience now cannot be compared with these so-called timeless creations. I believe being architects, we have been inspired by those master pieces pertaining to that era, said Samarasekara.
We live in an era where everything around us is rapidly changing. Science is making amazing advances. Dolly the sheep was the first mammal cloned. If life can be created in such a way, can there be substitutes for architects
I dont think robots and computers can take over the creativeness of an architect. Artificial intelligence wont be able to beat the creative power of an architect. Minimizing mistakes and providing a certain level of accuracy are just technical aspects with respect to achieving a certain creation, stated Samarasekara.
Sometimes we are torn between our deeper human needs, such as the need for rest, relaxation, belonging, identity and security, and running after prestigious images and symbols of the consumerist culture.
Always in achieving a comprehensive product, an architect will be addressing the deeper human needs such as the need for rest, relaxation, belonging, identity, security aspects, the lifestyle and behavioral pattern of the particular user through a unique concept. The particular images, forms and symbols may be some of the elements and tools that he can adopt, pointed out Samarasekara.
Death has been personified as the grim reaper, absolutely impartial and not a respecter of persons.
The inevitable death of humans and the decaying of buildings over the years can be conceded as the ultimate finale of a certain era, but the particular architectural language and style will be unique and inherent to that particular period, explained Samarasekara.
In previous articles, we touched on emotions. Like sociologists and psychologists, an architect is privy to the complex emotions of the mind.
An experienced architect can understand the nature of a certain client, throughout the design process and also through various discussions prior to this. The ultimate product will be providing solutions to various emotions associated with the particular user. His unique design concept consisting of various tailor-made spaces may provide solutions to various emotions such as anger, fearfulness, tiredness and stress, elucidated Samarasekara.
The secrets pertaining to various professions may be different from one to another. But the way you deal and react to your client, your ability to convince someone and the products you deliver will be helpful to retain the stability of any professional.
When you satisfy the clients various needs through a unique design concept, then it always becomes a livable space. Ultimately with a proper sequence of various steps that you may adopt, it will lead to achieving a practical product, which may be more logical with a timeless beauty, reflecting the creativeness of the architect, pointed out Samarasekara.
The service of an architect must never be underestimated. It is he/she that makes the difference between something really good and something really great.
Always great architecture will reflect friendliness to its environment. The relationship with purpose, along with the form and the uniqueness of addressing the various needs of the user will automatically make it great, said Samarasekara.
Being in the tropics is fun! You get ample sunlight throughout the year, you can open your windows and let the wind blow in! There are so many fun things you can do in the tropics. Your inside and the garden outside can be merged together because you dont have to close the windows. You can have a courtyard. You only need to guard against the rain. With the ample sunlight, you can create so many contrasts and shades. You can orient your house in so many ways.
Being in a tropical country, the buildings put up in Sri Lanka should always address various climatic aspects through various elements and forms. When you design a residence for someone through a proper design process, an architect will be providing solutions for various inevitable issues. In that sense building in the tropics provides more possibilities when it comes to achieving something, explained Samarasekara.
The challenges that you encounter may differ from one case to another for an architect. The nature of a particular response will depend on his experience and maturity. There may be some successful ways of merging traditional style with modernity. All this will depend on his creativity.
The architect will be the ideal person who can provide solutions for environmental, climatic, urban issues and financial crisis. The architectural education consists of a variety of subjects which helps to develop the thinking pattern of an architect in addressing such issues, argued Samarasekara.
Again practicing architecture in the tropics with the abundant sunshine allows us to create unique spaces. We can use these natural attributes to create some fine architecture. We can create so many moods and experiences.
Approach to spirituality will always depend on the ability of visualizing the space. It may be a very interesting exercise to practice spiritual spaces, summed up Samarasekara.

Palace Advisors
Politicians, whichever party they belong to, have no qualms about spending public funds indiscriminately on their behalf, especially, on ego boosting exercises and the sky is the limit. Rulers representing both major political parties have some monument or other, a sports stadium, airport or port named after them, all of which were built by public funds. Not only that, some of them even use public funds for personnel projects. Critics of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa held that the late leaders Gam Udawa programme was meant to promote his image and that he used public funds to build a Piya Gama and Maugama named after his parents. The public are aware as to how the Rajapaksas spent millions of public funds to build a cenotaph to commemorate their long departed parents, in Hambantota. It was also revealed that public funds were spent even for an overseas stint at a prestigious Defence Academy of a young Rajapaksa. The list goes on.
It is hoped that with the establishment of the Right to Information Act the public will get an opportunity to ascertain the extent to which politicians had used public funds for uses other than that which directly benefited the public. The same goes for the squandering of public funds to reward relatives, friends, and lackeys of the rulers. We say this because it is being revealed that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had spent over Rs. 90 million of public funds to pay the salaries of 196 advisors. State Minister Niroshan Perera replying to an Oral Question in Parliament on Tuesday, while naming four advisors currently serving President Sirisena, said there were no personnel secretaries and only six coordinating secretaries in the employ of the President.
There is no argument that all leaders have their own choices for the post of advisors and they are, needless to say, individuals who have won the confidence of the leader or those with close links. But there has to be a rationale for these appointments, since public funds are involved. Those functioning as advisors should posses the ability and capacity to provide the right counsel to the ruler so that what would ensue from this advise would be beneficial to the country and its people.
But this certainly was not the case under Rajapaksa where advisors were a dime a dozen, a good majority of them with dubious credentials, their only qualifications being their obsequiousness and fawning servility to the powers that be. These advisors not only had the ear of the then President but also the run of the Temple Trees, with some of them even becoming more powerful than Ministers. It was plain to one and all in the know that these appointees had no inkling as to what was expected of them and occupied the post purely for the salary and other perks that included luxury vehicles. Rajapaksa had a good assortment of these advisors who were repaid for their loyalty by the public purse. Among these advisors were a good many Bikkhus who were in the thick of Rajapaksas election campaigns in the past.
It is difficult to fathom what qualifications did a whole caboodle of Buddhist monks have to advise the former President who looked as if he did not need any advise on Buddhism. These advisors were also seen among the throngs that comprised the delegations that accompanied Rajapaksa overseas and put up in expensive Seven Star hotels, their bills paid for by the public. Not just Buddhist clergy, there were advisors representing all religions - some of them imposters- who had virtually pitched camp at Temple Trees. What counsel these men of the cloth offered Rajapaksa in spiritual guidance is difficult to comprehend when one considers the state repression, white van abductions, the murder of journalists etc. that were common at this time. Equally, what guidance had an oracle who doubled as an advisor and paid for by the public had to offer the former President that would have positively impacted on people is hard to fathom since Rajapaksa himself was duped by this palace seer.
Be that as it may, the Yahapalanaya government should seriously consider the role of advisors in its fold. They should be made productive or the post done away with. Only those with proven ability and professional and intellectual capacity in a particular subject, assigned to Ministries and government bodies dealing with that subject. The post of advisor, which bears significant stature within the ruling circles in the developed countries should not be devalued through the hiring of stooges, political rejects and sycophants. Above all, this post should not be made a refuge for jobs for the boys and gals. A means should also be sought for limiting the number of advisors in government and criteria specified for the post of advisor. Fore long, the post of advisor had been abused by all rulers to reward their friends, relatives and henchmen to earn a living, paid for by the public. Besides, a ruler who employs a large contingent of advisors is not doing himself much credit and runs the risk of being called an incompetent.

Present rice prices would go down by next week: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that rice prices would go down by next week, as the government had taken steps to import 51,000 metric tons of rice and another hundred thousand metric tons are to be released to the local market soon.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also said that the Rs. 15 special commodity levy upon a kilo of rice, was reduced to a Rs.5.00 as an incentive to reduce the rice prices in the market. He further pointed out that within the next three months, two hundred and fifty thousand metric tons of rice is to be imported due to drought conditions currently prevailing in the country.
PM Wickremesinghe was replying to a question forwarded by MP C.B. Ratnayake on the increased rice prices in the market.
"In 2014, the previous government did not purchase any paddy in the Yala season. We brought three hundred and thirty five thousand metric tons of paddy in 2015. With the current drought condition, we only hope for a 30% - 40% of paddy production for this season," PM Wickremesinghe said.
Minister of Special Assignments Sarath Amunugama, on the same issue said, by today one kilo of Nadu rice would be Rs.72 and one kilo of Samba will be Rs.80.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake confirmed that a gazette regarding this decision was issued yesterday.
Replying to a question raised by MP Dinesh Gunawardane, PM Wickremesinghe said the government had no problem regarding the issuance of necessary fertilizer to the farmers.
"The current problem at hand is the shortage of water. You should conduct a 'poojawa' for quick rain fall as a support for the people and the government," PM Wickremesinghe added.
PM Wickremesinghe also said the Public Utilities Commission is to raid sales outlets that sell rice for higher prices disregarding the controlled price.
Disallowing Dy Minister to speak, a reminder of Standing Orders
Explanations by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya over Standing Orders in Parliament was not aimed at either the Prime Minister or the Leader of the House, the Speakers Media Division said in a release yesterday.
When Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake stood up to answer an oral question by raised by UPFA MP Indika Anuruddha on behalf of the Lands Minister , the Speaker disallowed it stating it was against Standing Orders.
The Speakers media division said the Speakers explanation to the House at that time was not by any means an instruction to the Prime Minister or the Leader of the House, but a reminder on Standing Orders.
Country has lost nearly Rs. 110 billion from 15 public enterprises: COPE
The country has suffered a loss of about Rs 110 billion from 15 public enterprises of which the latest is on the Committee report on Public Enterprises (COPE) deals with Committee, Chairman Sunil Handunnetti said.
Handunnetti made this observation in Parliament yesterday, while tabling the third COPE report of the Eighth Parliament that contained findings and recommendations on 15 institutions which was summoned before the Committee from May 1 to August 31, 2016.
The 15 institutions include the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment, the Road Development Authority, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd., State Engineering Corporation, Telecommunication Regulation Commission, Sri Lanka Cricket, Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation, National Lotteries Board, Ceylon Electricity Board and Sustainable Energy Authority, Sri Lanka Football Federation, Sri Lanka Ayurvedic Medicine Corporation, four Maga Neguma Institutions under the Road Development Authority, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Kurunegala Plantations and the Employees Trust Fund Board.
Handunnetti highlighted the colossal waste and unfeasible and non-economical projects of these institutions which had made a huge negative impact on the countrys economy. Quoting the report, he said the accumulated loss of the Hambantota Port as of now is Rs 37 billion.
No party is willing to shoulder the burden concerning the loss making Sooriyawewa Cricket Stadium. Is it the State Engineering Corporation or the Ports Authority that has to pay the Rs 5.3 billion due for its construction The Road Development Authority had made many payments for projects not coming under its purview. The cost of the Lotus Tower project is another burden. The spending of millions of Euros and dollars received to the Sri Lanka Football Federation was not done transparently. The State Engineering Corporation has also suffered a loss of Rs 2,918 million, the COPE Chairman said.
He urged the relevant ministers to consider the reports recommendations seriously and implement them as soon as possible.
The COPE report says that the State Engineering Corporation had recruited 602 employees without the approval of the Department of Management Services. The Corporation had paid Rs 1,353,000 as salaries and Rs 626,000 as overtime allowances to employees who had been released for election work during the run-up to the 2015 elections. In the years 2013 and 2014, vehicles and drivers of the Corporation had been released to the Housing and Construction Ministry without the approval and Rs 37 million and Rs 42 million had been paid respectively as rental, fuel expenses and drivers salaries for the vehicles thus released.
The COPE had found that the Sri Lanka Rupvahini Corporation had telecast all the advertisements with a value of Rs 34,719,750 of one presidential candidate free of charge during the last Presidential election.
The National Lotteries Board has paid Rs 64,680,000 for displaying hoardings in November 2014 without properly depicting advertising purposes through the photographs depicted in them.
The COPE has also identified that there were irregularities in utilizing 100,400 Euros and 10.2 million US dollars which had been received by the Sri Lanka Football Federation.
The COPE has observed that the Employees Trust Fund had failed to work as a primary dealer though Rs 200 million had been invested in Treasury bonds through other institutions without calling for bids.
Bimal detours on SAITM issue
MP Bimal Ratnayake while querying as to when the University of Ruhuna would be opened from the Leader of the House Lakshman Kirella, made a detour when he question on the much controversial SAITM issue.
MP Ratnayake questioned Kiriella if he was aware that SAITM students are reluctant to produce their Advance Level Examination results.
Replying to Ratnayake, Kiriella swiftly replied that what mattered was really not the SAITM students' reluctance to produce their A/L results, but the reluctance displayed by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) members to reveal their A/L results.
Kiriella alleged that some GMOA members only had scored three 'S' passes in their A/L exams. They have been able to enter the universities because they had sat for their A/L examinations from rural districts, Kiriella alleged.
So why not the students who had received ordinary passes in their A/L examination get themselves enrolled in a degree they prefer, Kiriella questioned.
MP Ratnayake then questioned the Minister of Higher Education and Highways, as to who set the standards on road development in Sri Lanka.
Ratnayake was pointed out that the question was irrelevant. However, Kiriella later was compelled to reply that the Road Development Authority (RDA), which is under his ministry, was responsible for road development activities in Sri Lanka.
The reply was then followed by MP Ratnayake as to who was responsible to set standards to medical education in Sri Lanka.
"Is it the RDA that is also responsible in setting standards to the medical education in Sri Lanka" Ratnayake questioned.
Kiriella pointed out that since the SAITM issue had received a Court order, there is no point in questioning on the issue. MP Sunil Handunnetti, in his question to Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, also took time to again question as to who exactly was responsible to rule out the standards to the medical education in Sri Lanka.
When pointed out the question was irrelevant, Handunnetti was quick to reply that the question was indeed relevant, since the government university students who protested against the SAITM are now imprisoned.
MP Ramesh Pathirana, posing a supplementary question, repeated the question for the third time.
"Does any minister in the government know who is responsible in setting standards to medical education in Sri Lanka" Pathirana asked.
The question however was left unanswered.
Defence Minister to discuss resettlement issues of Keppapiluv with PM today
Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardane yesterday, said a meeting was due today with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to discuss issues related to the resettlement of Keppapiluv in Mullaitive area.
The State Minister was replying to an adjournment motion forwarded by TNA MP Sumanthiran, regarding the protest carried out by the first owners of the lands in Keppapiluv which was now being used by the Sri Lanka Air Force.
State Minister Ruwan Wijewardane said he could arrange a meeting with the Air Force Commander-in-Chief, along with other Military commanders an the Vanni District Secretary to further discuss the issue concerned.
He also pointed out that the Sri Lanka Air Force was unaware that lands they occupied were private property, since they were assigned with these lands by the Wildlife Department during the times of war.
"The Air Force established an Air strip during the war time in this area as a national security measure. Now, the air strip is used not only for military purposes, but also for civil affairs." Wijewardane pointed out.
All parties concerned, would be able to come to an amicable solution after several rounds of discussions, Wijewardane pointed out.
Gazette Notification to grant tax exemptions on CHEC Port City (Pvt) Ltd, in Parliament
The Government yesterday presented to Parliament a Gazette Notification to grant tax exemptions to the CHEC Port City Colombo (Private) Limited under the Strategic Development Projects Act.
The Gazette issued by Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama on January 30, was presented in Parliament by Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake.

PM declines release of Iranathivu Islands for resettlement
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday in Parliament, declined a request from TNA MP S. Sritharan to release Iranathivu Islands in Kilinochchi for resettlement.
Wickremesinghe said the Navy had informed that the Iranathivu Island could not be released for resettlement at present as it was a strategic location to control Indian fishermen from poaching and drug smuggling. The Premier was replying to a question by MP Sritharan during the Prime Ministers Question round. About 437 people belonging to 190 families left this island in 1990-1992 due to security threats during the war. However, the Navy is operating from this Island to prevent Tamil Nadu fishermen poaching into Sri Lankan waters and raid drug trafficking. Despite that, the people have been allowed to use the island for their agricultural, religious and fishing purposes. If these activities are obstructed, I would ask Minister D M Swaminathan, State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena and Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi to look into it and you could discuss the problem with them, he told the MP.

Reaching out with love and kindness
There is a popular Sinhala saying Colombata kiri gamata kekiri (Milk for Colombo and cucumber for the village), which highlights the great disparity in state education between Colombo and the more remote areas of the country.
Things have not changed much since then and now, for many remote schools. There is a great disparity in development activities between Colombo and the rest of the country. The facilities in the urban schools far exceeds the more remote schools which in many instances have been forgotten.
This is a story of a random act of kindness by a group of caring strangers which brought immence joy to these innocent little hearts. Development however, cannot be that random.
Around 100 miles away from Colombo, in the North Western Province lies the village of Kedannawa. The village has one primary school; the Kedannawa Primary school located in the Puttlam Educational zone in the Anamaduwa electorate.
Children received their education from Grade one to six but the school can only house five grades. To make up for it, the school has resorted to building a temporary shelters out of coconut branches for the grade five students. Around 90 children are taught by eight teachers in this school.
As fate would have it, as the country celebrated its Independence on February 4 amidst pomp and pageantry at Galle Face, a group of compassionate passengers on the Puttlam-Colombo train line stopped at this remote school, bearing gifts worth Rs. 500,000.
They brought school equipment, sports goods and musical instruments along with them and every child received a school bag with books, stationary, a lunch box and water bottle. The group had found their way to the school upon recommendation by a man named Jayakody who works for the Postal Department.
Every day we travel on the Colombo-Puttlam train to work. We work in different offices in Colombo but over the years we have come to know the familiar faces on the train and have became friends. This year we decided that we should all go on a trip together but after much deliberation we thought we should just help out a school in a remote area. We came here having called the Provincial Education Department but once we got here, we all knew that we made the right decision, said Shyamali Keruna Rajapakshe one of those who donated to the school.
The villagers, teachers and children welcomed us very warmly. We have never received such a welcome. But, we could not hold back the tears when we saw the children using scraps of tin hung around their neck as musical instruments when welcoming us, she added. Rajapakshe observed that the government had made big plans to distribute tabs to schools children in this years government Budget which was endorsed by many. While the children in Colombo are moving on to modern technology, those in more remote areas still had to make do with scraps of tin for musical instruments. For such a small country, the gap between the haves and have nots is immense, she added.
A drop of rain on parched land
Many residents in Puttlam are facing the consequences of the prevailing drought and the villagers of Kedannawa are no exception. Much of their paddy harvests this year have failed and many have had to opt for daily labour to survive. As a result the parents have had no time to focus on the childrens educational needs or to even spend extra on them.
The kindness of these total strangers has been like a sprinkle of rain on the desert. We have suffered for so long that it was as if we had become a parched land that had not received rain for many years. We certainly appreciate the kindness of these strangers who brought us some long overdue respite, said Sandya Kumari Wijesundara, a teacher at the school.
It has been 75 years since the school was first established and thousands of children have passed through its doors but no government has taken steps to provide it with a building. The present building as well as the temporary hut was made by the parents of the children and it was their money and effort that was put into it.
Having given everything to Colombo, they are now trying to give the children in Colombo schools tabs, but we dont even have a roof over our heads. I ask that the officials take a good look at our conditions and provide these children with much needed facilities, said Wijesundara. Having received the first rains through these compassionate passengers on a train, the school awaits the long overdue monsoons from the government.

SAARC must guard against ISIS: Defence Secy.
The severity of the issue of ISIS terrorism itself is enough for SAARC countries to strengthen its ties, Defence Secreatry Karunasena Hettiarchchi said at a panel discussion on SAARC, Its Impediments and Way forward.
Other panelists were Ex Secretary General of SAARC Nihal Rodrigo, Pakistan High Commissioner Major General Syed Shakeel Hussain, senior Anaysts from Pakistan Ikram Sehgal and Riffat Hussain, Director General of Institute of National Security Studies of Sri Lanka (INSSSL) Asanga Abeygoonasekara.
The event was held at Galadari Hotel, Colombo organised by INSSSL and the High Commission of Pakistan.
Hettiarachchi said, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are the most afflicted victims of terrorism in South Asia. It is essential for the member states of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to strengthen the association to combat terrorism.
During recent past South Asia has experienced numerous incidents of violence and extremism. The region turns out to be an epicenter of terrorism, he said.
The terrorist outfits, such as ISIS, have become a global threat with ability to cause violence transcending borders. It is disturbing that this began in the Middle East and spread to Europe and the United States. The United States is affecting our region as a result of this, he noted.
The Government of Sri Lanka believes that regional corporation is vital if terrorism is to be eliminated from the region, he said.
President Maithripala Sirisena has often emphasized the importance of building trust and unity among the members of SAARC, he said.
SAARC must also address challenges such as improving sustainable development and bilateral trade. Hettiarachchi said, The combined efforts of SAARC countries achieved commendable progress in all areas during the past thirty-one years owing to mutual trust the member states held in each other.
These achievements are a testament to the significance of our Regional Corporation.
However, there have been instances showing declination of that mutual respect, and the result was that the Association could not achieve its full potential, he pointed out. .
Speaking on the poverty alleviation programs in the region, Hettiarchchi said in spite of numerous such programs being launched targeting poor people , a very high number of people still live below poverty line without access to drinking water and education.
Countries such as Korea, South Korea and Singapore have come out of poverty not through special programs targeted at poor people, but because of economic development achieved by them, he added.

## Title: SAITM vs GMOA :Hypocrisy over Hippocratic Oath

SAITM vs GMOA :Hypocrisy over Hippocratic Oath
An issue that would have, in the ordinary course of events, become a debate for professional bodies and the legal system to engage in, is quickly snowballing into a political hot potato: the controversy over the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
What has triggered the current debate is last weeks ruling by the Court of Appeal directing the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to provisionally register graduates who have been awarded their medical degrees from SAITM. The much awaited verdict has led to howls of protest from the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) and medical students in state medical faculties but the issue is now threatening to spill over to the political arena.
It is unfortunate that an issue such as private medical education which is critical to the countrys wellbeing is being mishandled in this manner. In this exercise, the GMOA and the SLMC must take the lions share of the blame for their deplorable conduct but the SAITM has had its lapses as well.
There are a myriad of reasons why private medical education is warranted in Sri Lanka. The state universities produce just over a thousand doctors every year, which is not sufficient to meet the nations needs.
Private medical education
There is no bar to students studying medicine overseas and returning to Sri Lanka to practise their profession- although that is much more costly and results in the loss of valuable foreign exchange to the country.
Also, the method of selection to state medical faculties is not strictly on merit: it is on a district based system which can be justified for socio-political reasons but at the same time it deprives thousands of talented and competent young men and women of the opportunity to pursue a career in medicine.
The countrys first experimentation with private medical education came in the early 80s when J. R. Jayewardene was President. He gave his blessings to the North Colombo Medical College (NCMC) in Ragama. That too led to a tussle with the GMOA. Ironically, supporting the GMOA was the Government Dental Surgeons Association (GDSA) and its Secretary at the time was Rajitha Senaratne who is now Minister of Health and is supportive of SAITM gaining recognition.
The same slogans that are heard today  of buying the medical degree from the Veda Kadey- were heard then but the NCMC went on to produce doctors who have performed creditably both locally and internationally and are indeed an integral part of the staff of many state medical faculties. Therefore, for those familiar with the NCMC saga, there is a sense of dj vu about what is happening today.
The NCMC was eventually nationalised when Jayewardene passed on the Presidency to Ranasinghe Premadasa. It is understood that now, the GMOA and those aligned with it in their battle against SAITM, will be making the same demand from President Maithripala Sirisena.
However, it must be noted that the NCMC was nationalised under very different circumstances, when the country was in the throes of an insurrection launched by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in an era where corpses were a common sight on the streets and when the entire university system had come to a grinding halt.
The trigger for the current unrest, the Court of Appeal decision compelling the SLMC to register SAITM graduates, highlights several issues. The Court has arrived at its judgment based strictly on the legalities of the issue and observed that the SLMC has no power to take over the functions of the Higher Education Minister. It further observed that the SLMC had acted in violation of Section 19 of the Medical Ordinance when making regulations relating to SAITM without having any power to do so.
It ruled that recognition (or de-recognition) of SAITM was the prerogative of the Minister of Higher Education. Similarly, while the Medical Council can make recommendations regarding the registration of a medical degree, the authority for that decision finally rests with the Minister for Health.
SAITM students
More telling was the Courts observations regarding the process followed by the SLMC in refusing recognition. It observed that the SLMC team inspecting the facilities available at SAITM for undergraduate training recommended that SAITM develop a working relationship with the Ministry of Health, so it could improve training in disciplines such as Forensic Medicine and Community Medicine; yet it recommended that the SAITM degree not be recognised. The court noted that the observations do not match with the final recommendation.
The court was even more scathing with regard to the conduct of the SLMC in recognising the medical degree awarded by the Kotelawela Defence University (KDU). It noted that the SLMC had inspected the facilities at SAITM at length and submitted a detailed report before recommending that its degree not be recognised.
However, with regard to the KDU, the SLMC had considered the facilities at KDU in only two paragraphs of their report and come to the conclusion that the facilities provided for training were of a very high standard even prior to the construction of the teaching hospital. The court observed that it appears two different standards have been used when preparing these reports.
In fact, when the SLMC recommended improvements to SAITM, the latter sought assistance from the Ministry of Health. In January 2016, the Ministry agreed in principle to provide facilities at its hospitals and clinics at Avissawella and Kaduwela to allow clinical training in Community Medicine, Forensic Medicine and Psychiatry to SAITM students following a fundamental rights application filed by students in the Supreme Court. However, the GMOA thwarted this move, instructing its membership not to teach SAITM students at these locations.
It is also well known that other state medical faculties in the country, most notably at the Rajarata University and Eastern University, are woefully understaffed even if their teaching hospitals provide adequate clinical facilities for students. As a result, authorities in these universities struggle regularly to conduct lectures and examinations, often transporting lecturers from other universities to Anuradhapura and Batticaloa on an ad-hoc basis in desperate attempts to complete their curricula.
In fact, the President of the GMOA, Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya is listed as a visiting senior lecturer at the Rajarata University in the Department of Paediatrics which has only a visiting professor and no other senior lecturers! However, the facilities provided by these faculties are somehow deemed adequate by the SLMC; nor has the GMOA ever raised concerns about patient safety in view of the shortage of teaching staff at these state run medical faculties. Thus, the bona fides of both the GMOA and the SLMC in this entire exercise have to be questioned.
The integrity of the President of the SLMC, Carlo Fonseka has also been called in to question following the Court of Appeal decision. Previously a much respected Professor in Physiology, Fonseka served as Competent Authority for the NCMC when it was nationalised. He is on record vociferously advocating the need for private medical education during the previous government, when SAITM was set up. Now however, he sings a different tune.
Fonseka would argue that it is all about maintaining proper standards in medical education, but the Court of Appeal has now observed double standards being employed by the SLMC itself. If Fonseka has a fibre of decency remaining within him, he should have resigned forthwith for that is what honourable men do.
In all of this, SAITM has confined its battles to exploring legal avenues. However, in comparison to the NCMC thirty five years ago, it too appears to have made some blunders in its quest for recognition. The NCMC was administered by the College of General Practitioners, a non-profit making organisation while SAITM is owned by Dr. Neville Fernando, a doctor who took to politics and then successfully tried his hand at business. A frequent charge against SAITM is that it is a business. While profit should not be a dirty word, SAITM erred in enrolling two batches per year during recent years which only aggravated the claim that it was all out to make money.
The NCMC, using funds it realised from students built a teaching hospital in Ragama and donated it to the government to administer. SAITMs Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital remains a private hospital, thus attracting low numbers of patients. While donating the entire hospital to the government may not be feasible financially at least a section of it will need to be operated on a non-fee levying basis, if it is to generate adequate numbers of patients required for clinical training.
Matters have now taken a turn for the worse following the Court of Appeal verdict when the GMOA began actively canvassing political support for its campaign against SAITM. It met with the JVP leadership as well as former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The issues at stake- the principles of private medical education and ensuring proper standards in this process- will unfortunately pale into insignificance and politics will come to the fore, if political parties now dabble in this.
Rajapaksa has already been wrong-footed on this issue. He went public opposing the SAITM and posing the question as to whether only children of powerful people should be allowed to become doctors. His statement attracted ridicule and derisive responses in the media asking whether only children of powerful people should be allowed to become lawyers as well, a thinly veiled reference to his own circumstances. Besides, a video has emerged where he is seen distributing scholarships to SAITM students when he was President!
Home-grown doctors
The incident where the Chief Executive Officer of SAITM, Dr. Sameera Senaratne was allegedly shot at on Monday night adds an entirely different dimension to the issue.
It indicates that the battle is getting uglier by the day although the immediate step that is likely to be taken is appealing the decision of the Court of Appeal in the Supreme Court, which the SLMC is likely to do.
From what has transpired thus far, it appears that the laws relating to the registration of doctors in the country need to be reviewed and strengthened to allow the SLMC to retain its role of ensuring proper standards in the medical profession.
However, the SLMC and the GMOA are equally culpable of being on a malicious and vindictive witch hunt against SAITM, instead of using the powers and resources at their disposal to assist the institution to produce home-grown doctors. As a result, a few hundred young Sri Lankans are left in limbo after years of toiling hard for a medical degree and the medical profession is fast losing its standing as a noble calling.

Should Sri Lanka Roll Over in Geneva
The 47-member Human Rights Council (HRC) has a mandate to hold no fewer than three regular sessions a year, for a total of at least ten weeks. These sessions take place in March (four weeks), June (three weeks) and September (three weeks). Further, if one third of the Member States requests, HRC could decide to hold a special session at any time, to address human rights violations and emergencies. That was how the 11th Special Session of the HRC was convened to consider the situation in Sri Lanka in 2009, a week after the conflict came to an end.
Noteworthy is the fact that the request for convening the special session was made by the Permanent Representative of Germany to the United Nation on 19th May, the very day hostilities, which witnessed the defeat of the LTTE, and rescue of over 300,000 civilians held hostage by that organisation, came to an end.
It is a well-known fact that both the United Kingdom and France were miffed at Colombos decision to continue the fight against the LTTE to an end, even after a mission undertaken by the two foreign ministers during the last days of the conflict to save the LTTE leadership from annihilation. That effort to pass strictures against Colombo failed to bear results, as Sri Lanka successfully marshalled support of 29 members of HRC, in favour of resolution S-11/1 Assistance to Sri Lanka in the promotion and protection of human rights sponsored by Sri Lanka.
UN human rights mechanisms
Resolutions on the human rights situation in Sri Lanka are not a new phenomenon. Way back in 1987, while the armed conflict against the LTTE was at its infancy, Sri Lanka had to face a hostile resolution in the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), the forerunner to HRC. On that occasion, the initiative to take Sri Lanka before the CHR was made by distantly situated Argentina at the bidding of Sri Lankas closest neighbour, India. Why Argentina chose to act as cats paw was due to Sri Lankas vote in favour of the UK in the United Nations General Assembly on the Falklands issue.
The two experiences in1987 and 2009 have an interesting similarity. That is, the UN human rights mechanisms were used by politically and economically powerful countries to target selected countries. Sadly, that situation continues even after the establishment of HRC in 2006. Despite allegations of human rights violations, Sri Lanka also served CHR, on more than one occasion.
Sri Lanka fought valiantly in 1987 and dragged consideration of the resolution until the last hour of the last day of the spring session. Sri Lankan delegation spearheaded by late H.W. Jayewardene and Ambassador Jayantha Dhanapala succeeded in amending the resolution to take care of its concerns and allowed it to be adopted. However, Sri Lanka was wise enough not to cosponsor that resolution. That was not what Sri Lanka did in September 2015.
Having resisted three previous resolutions since 2012, Colombo decided to co-sponsor resolution 30/1 that had unprecedented 23 introductory paragraphs that set the stage for 20 operational paragraphs, filling five pages! By doing so, Sri Lanka became party to the resolution and committed the country to take certain measures, which now it finds difficult to deliver. The current position taken by Colombo that foreign judges cannot sit in judgement without amending the constitution and seeking consent of the people at a referendum is one such example. Another is the thinking that adopting a new Constitution takes priority over setting up courts to probe war crimes. These two are not the only examples where Sri Lanka is forced to backtrack.
US resolution on Sri Lanka
Pathfinder Foundation believes March will be reckoning time for Sri Lanka. Having become party to the resolution inspired by the west, the new administration that promised good governance and upholding of human rights, must now decide how it should handle the forthcoming spring session. The original sponsor of the 2012 was the United States, to the extent it was known as a US resolution on Sri Lanka. Along with that country, the United Kingdom too played a key role. So, it will be the task of these countries to shepherd Sri Lanka in the direction desired by them. Letting Colombo off the hook is not a choice for them and they would use all their persuasive skills in Colombo, Geneva, London and Washington DC to keep Sri Lanka dangling until they succeed in extracting the maximum.
In the eyes of the west that is the price Sri Lanka should be pay for its impertinence way back in 2009, when Colombo failed to lobby and prevent a special session of HRC from being held to discuss the situation in Sri Lanka and decided to sponsor its own resolution in Geneva. Admittedly relations between the previous administration and the west was such, lobbying at that point would have been a futile effort.
Some believe that turning the tables against the west at the special session resulted in the country becoming a target at the subsequent sessions of HRC. Others express the view that the feeling of euphoria in May 2009 was such, Sri Lanka, still in a combative mood, could not have agreed to strictures by the west. It may be that the same feeling of euphoria after the election victory prompted Sri Lanka to cosponsor the resolution in 2015 without considering consequences!
As Sri Lankas progress in implementing the resolution has been tardy, major sponsors of resolution 30/1 could be persuaded to agree to an arrangement called roll over, thereby postponing the judgement day. If Colombo has made steady progress, but failed to fulfil some of the commitments given in Geneva  there are not less than seven of them in the resolution  a decision to roll over would be easy. The first question is, how long will Sri Lanka be allowed to roll Will it be twelve months (i.e. March 2018) or 18 months in September
The next question is, will Colombo be able to satisfactorily fulfil all the commitments it voluntarily undertook to fulfil, including the proposal to establish a commission for truth, justice, reconciliation and non-recurrence; establish an office of missing persons and an office for reparations; participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism of the Commonwealth and other foreign judges; trial and punishment of those responsible for crimes; undertaking a review of the Public Security Ordinance Act and to review and repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act; release publicly, previous presidential commission reports; take constitutional measures for a political settlement including devolution of political authority etc.
Office for Missing Persons
The other question is, if a roll over is granted for one year, which must be negotiated in advance of the March session, would Sri Lanka be able to satisfactorily fulfil all the commitments referred to above and other demands made within a space of 12 months By this time, the Foreign Ministry should be aware what Sri Lanka has achieved since adoption of that resolution. What the administration should carefully consider with all honesty and sincerity is, whether it could and would make good of the solemn undertakings given to the international community two years ago.
The administration also should consider the consequences it must face, if it falls short of fully implementing the resolution at the end of the roll over period. Going by the past performance and the prevailing ground situation in the country, it is not too difficult to guess what would be Sri Lankas performance at the end of the negotiated period. At that time, Sri Lanka should be ready to explain why it failed to fully address the commitments given to the HRC.
The current situation and thinking seems to be vastly different from those in 2015. That position appears to be, foreign judges can participate but not sit in judgement and adopting a new constitution is more important than commencing a probe on war crimes etc.
What would be the situation if the constitution making process currently underway suffers a setback Even establishment of an Office for Missing Persons appears to have fallen between the cracks. If this is the real situation on the ground, what will Sri Lanka achieve by demanding a roll over Is it not better that we explain the ground situation clearly and succinctly and extricate ourselves from a worst situation we may have to face next year In the circumstances, it would be advantageous for Sri Lanka to renegotiate the resolution during the March session
Sri Lanka has gone through a roll over in the past. That was during the 28th session of the HRC, exactly two years ago. If such an understanding is reached yet again, Sri Lankan issue will not be subject to discussion at the forthcoming session. Moreover, the High Commissioner for Human Rights will be spared of having to present a report on Sri Lanka. Consequently, developments in Sri Lanka will not be subject to discussion and all those tedious tasks could be postponed to 2018. But then, Sri Lanka must be ready to deliver when the issue comes up for discussion in 2018, whether it happens during the March or September session.
There are other options as well. Sri Lanka could negotiate a purely technical procedural resolution requesting HRC to postpone consideration of resolution 30/1 to a future session say for example to 38th or 39th session in March or September 2018. Unlike in the case of a simple roll over decided at an organisational meeting, such a resolution would generate some discussion on the situation in the country, courtesy interested delegations and the NGO community egged by the Tamil Diaspora. While such a discussion is unavoidable, there is another danger. Delegations in Geneva have the habit of front loading such resolutions with the intention of leaving their fingerprints to be shown to their capitals.
It is a well-known fact that some delegates in Geneva make careers out of human rights situations just as much as those in foreign capitals. If such a situation happens, there is no guarantee about limiting the contents of the so called procedural resolution would end up. If that is going to be the case, that exercise would be akin to negotiating a new resolution. Moreover, there could be attempts by eager beavers to go beyond what is reflected in resolution 30/1, such as reference to the recently released report on The Consultations Task Force (CTF) on Reconciliation Mechanisms!
UN members
HRC was established in 2006, replacing its predecessor CHR. It was the expectation of member countries that ills afflicted the latter organisation could be addressed by the new entity. However, what has happened is exactly the opposite. HRC was quickly overwhelmed by UN members that represent the developed west known as the West European and Others Group (WEOG). It is this group that dominates the HRC and decides, which country should be hauled before it and who in their group should choreograph that exercise. For example, in the second half of 1980s, Sri Lanka was handled by Canada. Today the USA and UK have taken over that responsibility. Likewise, other members of WEOG will be driving resolutions targeting other developing countries particularly in Asia and Africa. To counter this onslaught, those countries have established group called Like-Minded Group. It was this group that came for support of Sri Lanka during the special session in May 2009.
The Foreign Ministry, should be aware how the CHR and its worthy successor HRC were progressively politicized and used as a tool by the west to subdue targeted countries. Ironically today Sri Lanka has more than one centre of gravity focusing on foreign relations. As such, there is lack of coordination resulting in confusion, which should be avoided in the interest of the country.
Role of the Geneva based clearing house on human rights, known as the Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), in manipulating human rights has been a subject of discussion for some time. Being an institution of the United Nations system, one would expect that office to be impartial in its role and function. There are allegations of manipulation by that office. It is a well-known fact that where staffing of the OHCHR is concerned, it is more of a domain of the west.
A scrutiny would reveal that China and India, being the most populous countries in the world representing almost 40% of the humanity have only a handful staffers in that office. A survey conducted some time back revealed that countries such as the US, UK, France, Germany and even Italy have unusually high numbers in the staff in the OHCHR. There are also junior staff members in that office, who are being paid by some member countries. It is not a surprise that those countries would be in a better position to influence the day to day work of OHCHR through such officers.
Against this backdrop it is not a surprise that hardly any developed country in the west get hauled up by the HRC. It is not that there are no violations of human rights in those countries or their troops do not get involved in violation of human rights. Similarly, it is rarely if at all, when oil rich gulf countries are targeted by HRC. So, to keep business going as usual, HRC must find victims elsewhere and where else could they be found other than in Asia or Africa
This does not mean Sri Lanka has been lily white and being scrutinized unfairly by HRC. In the last four and half decades the country and its people have gone through two insurgencies in the south and faced the brunt of separatism in the north and the east. During this period, allegations of human rights violations have been rampant. In the 1980s disappearances in Sri Lanka were second only to Iraq. Similarly, over the years there have been reports of extra-judicial killings including large scale massacres, torture, attacks against journalists and countless number of other allegations resulting in the word impunity been widely used to describe the situation in the country. Hence the demand for accountability and prosecution of offenders. Whether there could be genuine reconciliation without bringing individual violators to justice is something that needs to be addressed. Crime without justice is an invitation for repetition in the future.
Leadership changes in US and UK
Against this backdrop, administration in Colombo has an unenviable responsibility to fulfil in the human rights field. The international scenario has undergone new developments with leadership changes in the US and UK. This may present an opportunity for Sri Lanka to present its case to the international community.
Based on the above, Pathfinder Foundation recommends:
Rather than seeking a postponement of consideration of the situation and facing the eventuality next year, Sri Lanka should explain the prevailing ground situation e.g. foreign judges, constitutional measures etc. to the main sponsors of the resolution and undertake renegotiation of the resolution based on ground realities in Sri Lanka. Whether opting for a roll over or seek purely technical, procedural resolution, Sri Lanka should bear in mind that the breathing space allowed would be for a limited time. As such, the government should make urgent arrangements to put in place mechanisms to implement the re-negotiated commitments bearing in mind its credibility will be at stake.
Government has a responsibility towards its citizens first. Crime without punishment is not the way for reconciliation. Prosecution of offenders in relation to cases, where threshold of evidence has been established, should be given priority. Members of the armed forces, police etc. should be informed at high political level that they will be held individually accountable for violation of human rights.
Government should continue its cooperation with mandate holders appointed by HRC.

Spreading the word of Krishna
Most people are eager to achieve money or fame. But without expecting anything in the age of 70, Bhakti Vedantha Swami Prabhupada accomplished a great record.
Swami Prabhupada was born in 1896 and met his spiritual Master (Guru) Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswathi Goswami in 1922 at the age of 26. The Guru liked this educated young man and convinced him to dedicate his life to teaching Vedic knowledge in the Western world. Srila Prabhupada became his student, and 11 years later (1933) at Allahabad, he became his formally initiated disciple.
Recognizing Srila Prabhupadas philosophical learning and devotion, the Gaudiya Vaisnava Society honoured him in 1947 with the title Bhaktivedanta. Bhakti-vedanta meaning one who has realized that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the end of all knowledge.
In 1950, at the age of 44, Srila Prabhupada retired from married life, and four years later he adopted the vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his studies and writing.
Srila Prabhupada traveled to the holy city of Vrndavana, where he lived in very humble circumstances in the historic medieval temple of Radha-Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and writing. He accepted the renounced order of life sannyasa in 1959. At Radha-Damodara, Srila Prabhupada began work on his lifes masterpiece, a multivolume translation and commentary on the 18,000-verse Srimad-Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana).
Publications
He has written over 60 volumes of authoritative translations, commentaries and summary studies of the philosophical and religious classics of India.
In 1944, (from his front room at Sita Kanta Banerjee, Calcutta), he started the publication called Back to Godhead, for which he acted as writer, designer, publisher, editor, copy editor and distributor. He personally designed the logo. His well known name, Prabhupada, is a Sanskrit title, literally meaning He who has taken the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord where prabhu denotes Lord and pada means taking shelter.
From 1950, he lived at the medieval Radha-Damodar mandir in the holy town of Vrindavan, where he began his commentary and translation work of the Sanskrit works Bhagavata Purana. His guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, had always encouraged him that If you ever get money, print books, referring to the need of literary presentation of the Vaishnava culture. Sri Roopa Gaudiya Matha Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh was the place where Prabhupada used to live, he had written and studied in the library of this building, and here he edited the Gauiya Patrika magazine.
Time was moving fast. Swami Prabhupada was achieving the age of 70. It could be the right time swami Prabhupada to accomplish the command of the Guru. So Prabhupada was trying to go to America to spread the knowledge of Krishna Conscious to the English speaking world.
A shipping company owner Sumathy Morarji was a devotee of Lord Krishna and she was well known to swami Prabhupada. Swami Prabhupada approached her and requested her help to go to America.
Sumathi Morarji was able to do any help to Swami Prabhupada but as he was very old she thought it will not be suitable for him to travel to America.
She said No. You are not healthy. It would be too cold there. You might not be able to come back, and she doubted whether he would be able to accomplish much there. People in America were not so cooperative, and they would probably not listen to him.
Sumati Morarji was concerned. Swamiji, you are so old. You are taking this responsibility. Do you think it is all right
He reassured her, lifting his hand as if to reassure a doubting daughter, it is all right.
But do you know what my secretaries think They say, Swamiji is going to die there.
Swami Prabhupada made a face as if to dismiss a foolish rumor. Again he insisted that she give him a ticket.
All right, she said. I will make an arrangement to send you by our ship. Swami smiled brilliantly and happily left her offices, past her amazed and skeptical clerks.
He then left India, obtaining free passage on a freight ship called the Jaladuta, with the aim and a hope of fulfilling his spiritual masters instruction to spread the message of Krishna Conscious around the world. In his possession were a suitcase, an umbrella, a supply of dry cereal, about eight dollars worth of Indian currency forty Rupees and several boxes of books.
Voyage
During this voyage swami Prabhupada landed in Sri Lanka on August 19, 1965. The Sri Lankan branch of ISKCON is celebrating his visit of 50 years.
Swami Prabhupada mentioned in his Diary about his arrival in Sri Lanka as follows;
The next morning 19/08/65 I informed my situation to Captain Pandia and he was very kind to take me to the shore in a motor launch. We dropped at Elizabeth gate talked with some Ceylonese clerks and then in a taxi we went to the office of Narottam & Pierera Co. The manager Banka was a Gujarati gentleman and he received us well. He arranged for me a good car to go around the city.
The office quarter was quite busy and many foreign offices and renowned banks were there. I saw the Governor Generals house, the Parliament House, the Town Hall (and) one very nice sea-side Hotel and passed through very nice clean roads, bazaars. The city appeared to be nice and clean, and the small bungalows nicely decorated. The city is quite up to resembling an Indian city like Madras and Poona. The busses and taxis were clean to see. The bus stands almost crowded like that of the Indian cities. The offices conducted almost in Indian style. The culture and civilization is Indian but artificially India and Ceylon is divided. We start for Cochin at 6 p.m.
By journeying to USA, he was attempting to fulfill the wish of his guru, possible only by the grace of His dear Lord Krishna.
The journey proved to be treacherous. During the arduous forty-day sea journey the ship met heavy storms. For two consecutive nights, he had severe heart attacks which almost killed him. On the third night, Lord Krishna appeared to Srila Prabhupada in a dream. The Supreme Lord Himself was pulling the ship to America, encouraging Srila Prabhupada and giving him all protection. Srila Prabhupada penned this prayer upon reaching New York City.
When he sailed to the United States in 1965, his trip was not sponsored by any religious organization, nor was he met upon arrival by a group of loyal followers. As the Indian freighter Jaladuta neared his destination.
On 13 September he wrote in his diary: Oh my Lord Krishna, I do not know why you have brought me here. Now you can do whatever you like with me. But I guess you have some business here, otherwise why would you bring me to this terrible place How will I make them understand this message of Krishna consciousness I am very unfortunate, unqualified and most fallen. Therefore, I am seeking your benediction so that I can convince them, for I am powerless to do so on my own.
He then sat under a tree in a park in New York City, played on some small hand cymbals, and sang the Hare Krishna mantra:
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. 
Surprisingly, some young people walked over, sat down, and joined in with this strange chant. They listened with interest when he spoke of yoga and of how meditation could take them to a higher level of consciousness. With the help of students, Bhaktivedanta Swami rented a small storefront on New Yorks Lower East Side to use as a temple.
Later, in a small shop in front of the Temple some people watched, fascinated, as he performed the traditional arati ceremony with incense, bells and lamps, and followed him as he showed them how to chant the mantra using wooden beads. He even cooked vegetarian meals for them, with delicious, exotic-sounding names; dahl, subji, chapatti, pakorah, samosa, halavah, laddhu and gulabjamon.
The young people had never experienced anything like this before. Gradually he taught them how to live a good and simple life, free from bad habits and confusing ideas.
In July of 1966, Bhaktivedanta Swami established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). Under Srila Prabhupadas pure guidance the Krishna consciousness movement quickly flourished. Within months ISKCON Radha-Krishna temples opened in New York, San Francisco, Boston, Los Angeles, and Montreal.
Tours
After a group of devotees and a temple had been established in New York another center was started in San Francisco in 1967. From there he traveled throughout America with his disciples, popularizing the movement through street chanting (sankirtana), book distribution and public speeches. One of 108 worldwide temples he opened by 1977, was dedicated to Krishna-Balarama.
Once ISKCON was more established in the USA a small number of devotees from the San Francisco temple were sent to London, England. By the time of his death in Vrindavan in 1977, ISKCON had become an internationally known expression of Vaishnavism. In the 12 years from his arrival in New York until his final days, he circled the globe 14 times on lecture tours that took him to six continents. He also directed the founding of the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, which claims to be the worlds largest publisher of ancient and classical Vaishnava religious texts and he founded the religious colony New Vrindavan in West Virginia.
He authored over 80 books (with many available online on Vedantic philosophy, religion, literature and culture including four published originally in Bengali). He introduced international celebrations in the capitals of the world such as Jagannatha processions. According to the most recent issue of Back to Godhead magazine, founded by Prabhupada, there are at present, over 400 temples and farm communities listed to visit.
The Sri Lankan branch of ISKCON Sri Radhakrishna Temple was opened in 1976. At present, they are constructing a new large temple for Lord Vishnu at 188, Newchetty Street, Colombo 13.

Sri Lanka to seek additional time to investigate war crimes

TheSri Lankan Foreign Minister said on Wednesday (8) that the country will petition the UN for more time to investigate the allegations of war crimes occurring during thecountry's 26-year-long civil war.
Sri Lanka promised the UN in 2015 to investigate the estimated 65,000 missing peoples from the civil war with the Tamil Tigers.
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera communicated that the government would seek an extension at the next UN human rights session that begins at the end of this month.
The global community has been calling on the Sri Lankan government to create more accountability, most recently since the end of the Sri Lankan civil war.
Last month a Sri Lankan panel of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms recommended the appointment of a hybrid court composed of local and international judges to oversee the adjudication of allegations of war crimescommitted during the nation's civil war.
Late last year the UN Independent Expert on minority issues, Rita Izsk-Ndiaye urged the Sri Lankan governmentto better protect minorities.
The UN released a report in 2015 finding thatwar crimes may have been committed during the war.
Later in 2015 thePresident of Sri Lanka rejecteda UN recommendation for international involvement in its domestic investigation of the war crimes.

Two die of oral cancer daily
Two or three persons die of oral cancer in Sri Lanka daily.Fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of cancers detected in Sri Lanka is oral cancers, Acting Health Services Director General Dr.Jayasundara Bandara said.
According to Dr. Bandara,Oral and Maxillo-Facial Surgeries have achieved a great advancement during the past years and now facilities are available at the newly opened National Dental Teaching Hospital for such surgeries. Even the scar of the surgery can be removed with the latest laser treatment. He expressed these views during a press briefing held in Colombo to mark the International Dental and Maxillofacial Surgeons Day falls on February 13th. Dr. Bandara pointed out that presently the Government spends around 3.2 percent from the GDP on the health sector and there are over 25 clinics available countrywide to offer advanced dental treatment to the public. The Government does not limit the funds when it comes to offering medical treatment to the public.
The media has a responsibility to educate the public on available free advanced dental treatment. The doctors attached to state hospitals should treat journalists well in order to maintain a healthy relationship which will benefit both parties. Media should be handled carefully like the way we handle a serpent. The serpent bites only when we hurt it. It does not bite when caught from the head, he added.

Welikada prison killings: Action against those responsible: PM
Action will be taken against individuals responsible for the killings of prisoners at the Welikada prison in 2012 once the Government receives the Police report into the incident, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister yesterday in Parliament tabled the report of the Commission which probed into the Welikada Prison clash on November 9, 2012.
He tabled it in response to a question by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
MP Dissanayake, observing that 27 prisoners were killed and another 40 prisoners were injured during the shootout at the Prison, inquired what action would be taken against the assassins behind this controversial incident.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe on behalf of the Government strongly condemned those killings at the Prison which took place during the previous regime led by Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He said he had already instructed the Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry to take steps to implement the recommendations given in the Committee report. The Committee led by retired High Court Judge Nimal Nambuwasam also included retired Senior DIG Ashoka Wijethilake and retired Administrative Officer S. K. Liyanage. It was appointed by Justice Minister Dr.Wijayadasa Rajapakshe on January
22, 2015 and its report was submitted on June 9. However, the report was not in public domain until it was tabled yesterday.
The Prime Minister said a copy of the report has also been forwarded to the IGP. He said the Justice Minister has sought the Cabinet approval to pay Rs 500,000 each as compensation for family members of the prisoners killed, and Rs 100,000 each as compensation for prisoners injured.
He said report of the Commission could be taken up by the relevant oversight committee for discussion.
He said Parliament would be informed of the future steps the Government intends to take to reveal the assassins and steps to be taken against them once the Police report into the incident is submitted. We do not want to hide anything. That is why we presented the report to Parliament, he added.

Writ petition filed by Sena Mills over importation of palm oil dismissed
The Court of Appeal has dismissed a writ petition filed by Sena Mills Refineries Pvt. Ltd.seeking an order preventing customs from causing investigations and inquiry into 24 containers of palm oil.
The petitioner Sena Mills Refineries Pvt Ltd had cited Director General of Customs and Chief Assistant Preventive Officer of Customs as respondents.
Preventing operations branch of Sri Lanka Customs detained 24 containers declared as Crude Palm Fatty Acid (CPFA) in March 2016 and caused investigations.
Having referred the drawn samples to accredited laboratories in Sri Lanka and overseas for physiochemical analysis and product identification, it has been confirmed that the product is palm oil with a free fatty acid content ranging from 16-20%. Since the product has been declared by the consignee Sena Mills Refineries Pvt Ltd as crude palm fatty acid, it was never referred for certification under food act and Sri Lanka standards.
The maximum free fatty acid content stipulated for imported palm oil under the gazette notifications published in line with the Food Act and Import Control Act is 5% for crude palm oil and 0.1% for RBD (Refined Bleached and Deodorized) palm olein. As described in the expert opinion submitted by Dr.Janak Vidnarachchi, senior lecturer, faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya on the laboratory reports, containing of higher percentage of free fatty acid in palm oil poses threats of heart deceases and cancers. Approximately 17,000 MT of same product in 850 containers has already been imported by the same company since 2012.
The importer had declared that the product crude fatty acid he imports is subjected to a refining process in Sri Lanka and improves to come within the stipulated 0.1% FFA before released to the market as RBD palm olein.
As revealed at the investigations, the importer through his exporter in Malaysia had submitted a manufacturing process describing the product crude palm fatty acid as obtained from the top of the distillation columns during the distillation process of palm oil.
The investigation officers had sought the assistance of Malaysian palm oil board on this issue and MPOB having conducted investigations on the manufacturer/exporter in Malaysia, has reported that the product crude fatty acid is a blend of RBD palm olein and palm fatty acid distillate in the ratio of 75%-25% which has been done on the request of the importer in Sri Lanka.
When the investigations were carried out by customs, the importer sought a writ of mandamus by the case CA/Writ/158/2016 filed in the Court of Appeal claiming that since a classification ruling has been issued by the Nomenclature and Classification Committee of the World Customs Organisation, detention of containers is unlawful and no further investigation or inquiry could be carried out on this importation by Customs.
However, the Attorney General representing the Director General of Customs argued that the product imported has not properly declared to customs and also the product is adulterated palm oil although it is declared as crude palm fatty acid. He also pointed out that importation of adulterated food is prohibited by Section 2 of the Food Act No 26 of 1980 and become a restricted article for import in terms of section 12, 43 and 47 of the Customs Ordinance thus shall be forfeited. Further he argued that containing of higher level of free fatty acid in palm oil makes it unfit for human consumption.
According to the judgment, the Court of Appeal Justice Preethi Padman Surasena was of the opinion that the action of the customs to detain the 24 containers is well within the law and that there were reasons to believe the commodity declared as crude palm fatty acid is adulterated palm oil. Hence the Court sees no reason to prevent customs from causing investigations and inquiry into the importation. The writ application filed by Sena Refineries Pvt Ltd was dismissed with cost.
Presidents Cousel Romesh de Silva on the instructions of D.L.& F.de Saram appeared for the petitioner. Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathilake appeared for the respondents.
