Flemingo Foundation partners with The Music Project

Flemingo Foundation, the CSR arm of Flemingo International has signed an agreement to partner with The Music Project as part of its CSR initiatives.
As part of this, Flemingo will sponsor the music education for the children of Lakdas De Mel College, Kurunegala for the period till March 2017. The sponsorship includes their weekly classes, holiday programmemes, festival programmemes, competition as well as the Bi-annual UNITE orchestra residential workshop where the music project children from all schools come together.
The Music Project is inspired by El Sistema (a publicly financed voluntary sector music education programme in Venezuela) and aims to foster a sense of musical achievement on an individual and personal level by providing those whose lives might have been affected by poverty, war or abuse, a therapeutic and holistic opportunity to excel and fulfill their own potential within a thriving musical community. The Project aims to provide links between the children of the north and south using music as the link language and to ensure long term ties. As the programmeme progresses, the two orchestral communities from the north and south, work together to perform and participate in workshops that would involve instrumentalists and specialists. This end result would ensure that the kids of two diverse communities establish links through music, thereby achieving social cohesion, unity and harmony.
Flemingo Foundation since its inception has focused on children. Previously, they had been running a very successful educational and humanitarian project Educate to protect to raise awareness amongst Sri Lankan school children, as well as their parents and educators, against silent child abuse. In three years, the programmeme had reached out to more than 25000 children and 6000 adults, thus enabling and empowering them for a better life.
Flemingo has also sponsored SOS villages in Chennai, India and Africa in the past.

SLFP is not anyones fiefdom: Thalatha

The SLFP is not the fiefdom of anyone, said Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala. The minister, speaking at a UNP promotional programme in Kalawana, said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa thought that he could remain in power for more years. His son Namal Rajapaksa becomes President after him at whatever cost, she said. She said the Bandaranaike dynasty lasted for 50 years. The former President also thought that his family could rule for 50 years.
However, when the son of a farmer family from rural Polonnaruwa became President, it is hateful to them. They though it did not matter even if people perish as long as members of the Rajapaksa family become Presidents. Since there is no sign that the Rajapaksa family can come into the power, they try to block the path of President Maithripala Sirisena, he said.

Gammanpila like a parrot clamouring  for attention  - UPFA Gen. Secy.

United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said UPFA MP Udaya Gammanpila was like a pethappu.
He was responding to a question raised by a journalist regarding the comments made by UPFA MP Gammanpila on late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaikes policies.
MP Gammanpila had said that the SLFP was created to break up parties.
Minister Amaraweera said MP Gammanpila simply uttered baseless allegations like a parrot with the intention of gaining cheap political advantage.
He questioned as to whether there was any value to the publicity afforded to MP Gammanpila, as he was without any proper party affiliation or adherents.
Preparations have now being finalised to celebrate the 65th Anniversary of the SLFP in Kurunegala on September 4 on a grand scale. This years rally would be the most outstanding of all rallies held by the SLFP in terms of mass people participation, said Fisheries Minister and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera.
He was responding to a question raised by a journalist with regard to the preparations of the SLFP anniversary celebrations.
We have also invited the members of UPFA and also former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to participate at the anniversary celebrations, he said.
Minister Amaraweera said that all SLFPers at grassroots level, have realized the real political situation in the country and was now rallying around the party.
This is the nature of the SLFPers and when there is an attempt of dividing the party, they rise and team up with greater strength and vigour whenever sinister attempts are been made by distinguished elements to break up the party, he said.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist regarding the recent statement by UPFA MP Udaya Gammanpila on late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaikes policy, Minister Amaraweera said that he acts like a Pethappu and just makes baseless allegations with the intention of gaining political advantage.
