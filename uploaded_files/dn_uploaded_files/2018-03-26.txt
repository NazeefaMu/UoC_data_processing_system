Trinity-Kingswood rugby clash should be close
The eagerly awaited confrontation between the first two schools who played an inter-school rugby match in 1906, Kingswood College and Trinity will be a close tussle when they meet in a schools rugby match at Nittawela today at 4.30 pm.
It will be interesting to see how both teams who are good at rugby dish out today. Kingwoodians lost their opening game to Royal College and in the second game beat S. Thomas. Trinity who beat St. Anthonys College in the first game went down in the second game to St. Josephs College in their own den, due to poor rugby.
Kingswoodians is led by Tharindu Waligampala and Trinity by Avishka Shiek.

Untapped feminine talent
Across the world, International Womens Day was observed on March 8 to celebrate the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women. In Sri Lanka, it was celebrated on this day, too. But it was also celebrated again last week, when the Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT) hosted a conference, She Can: Inspired Women Inspire Women, centered on womens empowerment, to mark the occasion of the day. Featuring some of the most renowned women in the business sector, She Can was designed by IIT to empower and inspire women of all ages and sectors by allowing them to hear each others success stories. And indeed, they did.
Last Thursday evening, nearly one hundred women (and some men too) crowded into one of the event rooms at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall. The event was attended by the cream of Sri Lankas business field, corporate professionals secondary and tertiary education students, members of the media and IIT staff. And the audiencea sea of colourful saris, frocks, and pantsuitswas visibly jubilant for the night of programming that awaited them.
First up to speak, with a focus of Lets be the change we want to see, was Nilushi Jayatileke, the Director of Marketing, Personal Care, for Unilever Sri Lanka. She began her speech, during which she encouraged audience participation, by explaining that just 30 percent of Sri Lankan women are employed, and that the majority of those employed are migrant workers and estate workers. She added that women in the country make up jut 2.5 percent of top management roles in the business sector.
Then she arrived at a rather interesting culprit, one of many, for this disparity: women. She explained that women often constrained themselves by not allowing themselves to imagine they could achieve more esteemed positions. According to Jayatileke, womens career choices have increased in recent years; yet despite this, womens leadership in the professional sector has dropped.
Do you think society puts more emphasis on men to succeed than on women to succeed, she asked the audience. Most responded in the affirmative.
One reason, she said, is gender stereotyping of careers. Are females supposed to be nurses and teachers, versus doctors and engineers, she asked. She further prompted the audience to acknowledge whether they promote these stereotypes. Do we also look at it like that Are we more comfortable going to a male doctor versus a female doctor Are we comfortable with our structural engineers being female Should the sales force be male
The point, Jayatileke insisted, is that people have latched onto these stereotypes and follow them, involving themselves in safe yet stereotypical roles. So women must get beyond that.
She also explained that men in womens lives must be more involved in the domestic sphere to allow women to venture more into the business sphere. This would involve liberating both the men and the women of the country. And finally, she insisted that women stop calling each other and allowing themselves to be called bossy, which is a gendered term.
Next up to speak was Nilusha De Silva, the Founder and Managing Director of Skrumptious, a locally based brownie and dessert company. In her presentation, De Silva took a different and more personal approach, using humor to address the issue of women in entrepreneurship through invoking her own experience as a businessperson.
She said that before starting scrumptious, she wanted to answer the question of why Sri Lankan food brands have not, for the most part, gone global. She found that the reason was consistency and uniformity, and was then able to get her product down to a simple-step process.
Speaking of difficulties she faced when trying to start her own business, De Silva surprised the audience by saying that she had no issues with men.
The biggest lesson she said she learned was that the world did not revolve around her, and that people did not have to acquiesce to whatever she requested.
[Starting your own business] takes a while, but thats why your success becomes a success. If everybody says yes, if everybody agrees with you, if everybody says youre the best, youre not going to do any of these things well, she said.
I took everything in life easy before I started Skrumptious, and this company and this business really changed a lot of aspects in my life for the better.
Finally, she dismissed the notion that pervades some aspects of common culture, which claims that it is better or more prestigious to start ones own company than to be an employee of another.
Some people think its a greater achievement to do your own business. Actually, it is an achievement but it isnt a greater achievement than what youre doing at your organization. I left the corporate field because I realized that I was not good at it, I was not good at being an employee, I didnt have the skills that were required. Its up to you to decide what is right for you.
During the tea break, the audience members mingled with the speakers and each other, and an excited buzz permeated the halls of BMICH. Both the women and men in attendance could be heard discussing how much theyd already learned over the course of the evening, and how impressed they were with the speakers theyd heard.
After the tea break, there were two more speakers. Niloufer Anverally, the Founder & Managing Director of Cotton Collection, spoke about Women in Leadership  what it means to be a female leader and what struggles female leaders face. Shehani Seneviratne, the Chief Operating Officer of 99X Technology Ltd, spoke about Women in IT, outlining the barriers to entry and more for women interested in entering the technology sector.
The evening ended with a lovely panel featuring all the speakers, taking questions from the audience and remarking on the similarities and differences in each of their journeys. The imagery of the powerful Sri Lankan women on stage was inspiring and motivating.
And even more, it reinforced a quote by Hillary Clinton which was read at the beginning of the evening:
Women are the largest untapped reservoir of talent in the world. It is past time for women to take their rightful place, side by side with men, in the rooms where the fates of peoples, where their childrens and grandchildrens fates, are decided.

Wanted Leaders for a TB-free world
Each year we commemorate World TB Day on March 24 to raise public awareness about the devastating health, social and economic consequences of tuberculosis (TB) and to step up efforts to end the global TB epidemic. The date marks the day in 1882 when Dr. Robert Koch announced that he had discovered the bacterium that causes TB, which opened the way towards diagnosing and curing this disease.
Despite significant progress over the last decades, TB continues to be the top infectious killer worldwide, claiming over 4 500 lives a day. The emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) poses a major health security threat and could risk gains made in the fight against TB.
Theme
The theme of World TB Day 2018 - Wanted: Leaders for a TB-free world- focuses on building commitment to end TB, not only at the political level with Heads of State and Ministers of Health, but at all levels from Mayors, Governors, parliamentarians and community leaders, to people affected with TB, civil society advocates, health workers, doctors or nurses, NGOs and other partners. All can be leaders of efforts to end TB in their own work or terrain.
This is a critical theme, given the political importance of the upcoming UN General Assembly high-level meeting on TB this year, which will bring together Heads of State in New York. It follows on from a very successful Ministerial Conference on Ending TB in Moscow on 16-17 November 2017 which resulted in high-level commitments from Ministers and other leaders from 120 countries to accelerate progress to end TB.
World TB Day provides the opportunity to shine the spotlight on the disease and mobilize political and social commitment for accelerate progress to end TB.
Background
Last year, WHO reported that 10.4 million people fell ill with TB and there were 1.8 million TB deaths in 2016, making it the top infectious killer worldwide. This disease is deeply rooted in populations where human rights and dignity are limited. While anyone can contract TB, the disease thrives among people living in poverty, communities and groups that are marginalized, and other vulnerable populations.
These include: migrants, refugees, ethnic minorities, miners and others working and living in risk-prone settings, the elderly, marginalized women and children in many settings etc. Factors such as malnutrition, poor housing and sanitation, compounded by other risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol use and diabetes, affect vulnerability to TB and access to care. Furthermore, this access is often hindered by catastrophic costs associated with illness, seeking and staying in care, and lack of social protection, resulting in a vicious cycle of poverty and ill-health. The transmission of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) adds great urgency to these concerns.
Curable
Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that most often affect the lungs. Tuberculosis is curable and preventable. TB is spread from person to person through the air. When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become infected.
About one-quarter of the world's population has latent TB, which means people have been infected by TB bacteria but are not (yet) ill with the disease and cannot transmit the disease.
People infected with TB bacteria have a 5 to15 percent lifetime risk of falling ill with TB. However, persons with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a much higher risk of falling ill.
When a person develops active TB disease, the symptoms (such as cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss) may be mild for many months. This can lead to delays in seeking care, and results in transmission of the bacteria to others. People with active TB can infect 1015 other people through close contact over the course of a year. Without proper treatment, 45 percent of HIV-negative people with TB on average and nearly all HIV-positive people with TB will die.
Risk groups
Tuberculosis mostly affects adults in their most productive years. However, all age groups are at risk.
Over 95 percent of cases and deaths are in developing countries.
People who are infected with HIV are 20 to 30 times more likely to develop active TB (see TB and HIV section below). The risk of active TB is also greater in persons suffering from other conditions that impair the immune system.
One million children (0 to14 years of age) fell ill with TB, and 250 000 children (including children with HIV associated TB) died from the disease in 2016.
Tobacco use greatly increases the risk of TB disease and death. 8 percent of TB cases worldwide are attributable to smoking.
Global impact of TB
TB occurs in every part of the world. In 2016, the largest number of new TB cases occurred in Asia, with 45 percent of new cases, followed by Africa, with 25 percent of new cases.
In 2016, 87 percent of new TB cases occurred in the 30 high TB burden countries. Seven countries accounted for 64 percent of the new TB cases: India, Indonesia, China, Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, and South Africa. Global progress depends on advances in TB prevention and care in these countries.
Symptoms and diagnosis
Common symptoms of active lung TB are cough with sputum and blood at times, chest pains, weakness, weight loss, fever and night sweats. Many countries still rely on a long-used method called sputum smear microscopy to diagnose TB. Trained laboratory technicians look at sputum samples under a microscope to see if TB bacteria are present. Microscopy detects only half the number of TB cases and cannot detect drug-resistance.
The use of the rapid test Xpert MTB/RIF has expanded substantially since 2010, when WHO first recommended its use. The test simultaneously detects TB and resistance to rifampicin, the most important TB medicine. Diagnosis can be made within 2 hours and the test is now recommended by WHO as the initial diagnostic test in all persons with signs and symptoms of TB. More than 100 countries are already using the test and 6.9 million cartridges were procured globally in 2016.
Diagnosing multi-drug resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB (see Multidrug-resistant TB section below) as well as HIV-associated TB can be complex and expensive.
In 2016, 4 new diagnostic tests were recommended by WHO  a rapid molecular test to detect TB at peripheral health centres where Xpert MTB/RIF cannot be used, and 3 tests to detect resistance to first- and second-line TB medicines.
Tuberculosis is particularly difficult to diagnose in children and as yet only the Xpert MTB/RIF assay is generally available to assist with the diagnosis of paediatric TB.
-WHO
Key facts
Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide.
In 2016, 10.4 million people fell ill with TB, and 1.7 million died from the disease (including 0.4 million among people with HIV). Over 95 percent of TB deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries.
Seven countries account for 64 percent of the total, with India leading the count, followed by Indonesia, China, Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, and South Africa.
In 2016, an estimated 1 million children became ill with TB and 250 000 children died of TB (including children with HIV associated TB).
TB is a leading killer of HIV-positive people: in 2016, 40 percent of HIV deaths were due to TB.
Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) remains a public health crisis and a health security threat. WHO estimates that there were 600 000 new cases with resistance to rifampicin  the most effective first-line drug, of which 490 000 had MDR-TB. Globally, TB incidence is falling at about 2 percent per year. This needs to accelerate to a 4 to 5 percent annual decline to reach the 2020 milestones of the End TB Strategy.
An estimated 53 million lives were saved through TB diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and 2016.
Ending the TB epidemic by 2030 is among the health targets of the Sustainable Development Goals.

What exactly does a librarian do Everything!
Growing up, I liked to imagine what it would be like to work in a library. What little I knew about them was what Id gleaned from movies and TV because my conservative parents never took us to any and only let me read books they purchased from the Bible Book Store. I didnt know any librarians in real lifeoutside of the elderly woman who ran our tiny school media centerbut I understood librarians were smart and savvy. Cool and collected.
They were everything my rowdy, boundary-busting, literature-hating family was not. I envisioned a sweet future for myself sitting behind an elaborately carved wooden desk, surrounded by towering stacks of leather-bound books. Id read for hours in total silence, vanilla and almond perfuming the air. Pages wafting in a gentle breeze. Nobody around to bother me. With librarianship, Id finally have solitude. Peace.
Circulation desk
I cling to these happy memories whenever somebody breaks the copy machine for the fourth time that day by jamming a ballpoint pen inside the feed tray. Or spills their kale smoothie down the side of the circulation desk. Or when a person decides to eat an extra large pizza while vaping in the womens bathroom. I think: remember why you chose this job The elegance And I laugh.
The reality of being a librarian is that its hardly ever about sitting down and it has absolutely nothing to do with peace and quiet. Its about assisting others. Its about community service. Librarianship asks you to do 12 things at once and then when youre in the middle of those projects wonders if youve got any tax forms left or an eclipse viewer. Its endless questions. Its my two dollar fine pays your salary.
Its a grubby little hand at storytime grabbing your leg and smearing glitter glue down the side of pants youve already worn twice that week. Its finding the right answer to a question and reveling in that small joy for a bare moment before another patron comes up to ask you something even weirder. Its library work, and its exhausting.
A certain type of person gravitates toward this field. Its generally people with a thirst for research, those who love books, and individuals who understand theyll never pay back their student loans. Every job in a library depends on someone elses to function. Libraries are buzzing hives filled with extremely busy, frazzled, overworked people.
Staff and Librarians work together to make sure that everything runs as smoothly as possible, which it NEVER, EVER DOES. Lots of different types of library work happens everywherenew jobs crop up daily, thanks to evolving tech and shifting community needsbut there are some standard positions that remain eternal.
Peace and quiet
The reality of being a librarian is that its hardly ever about sitting down and it has absolutely nothing to do with peace and quiet. Its about assisting others.
First of all, theres the backbone of the library: technical services. These thankless individuals work in stuffy back rooms cataloging your books and movies, maintaining a plethora of exciting, information-rich databases so that students can continue to only use JSTOR for their assignments. They understand systems that have operating manuals that read like misprinted IKEA furniture assembly instructions.
Technical services staff are expected to deliver items that arent yet available because they havent been published, find books that are absolutely out of print, and expected to work a couple extra hours over the holiday break because someone in the Art History department wants access to Interlibrary Loan they wont even pick up until after New Years. Okay, yes, Im talking about me here.
Then you have your public services staff. They man the circulation and reference desks, helping patrons on the frontlines by answering continuous, nonsensical questions. These employees have to locate a book when all the patron knows is that the spine was possibly red with black writing and that there was maybe a dog in it.
Public services jobs are for those lucky individuals who have people skills, but those skills are tested daily by someone breaking the copy machine (again), and then yelling about fines, the renewal policy, and the fact they cant borrow some half-n-half from the staff fridge. Nobody wants to deal with a patron looking at porn again on the public computer. These are library employees who go home and drink a lot. All right, Im also talking about myself here. -Lit Hub

Withdraw school circular on MP, PC member invites - Teachers Union
The Ceylon Teachers Union has demanded that the Colombo Zonal Education office immediately withdraw a circular it issued which demanded that principals invite MPs and Provincial Council members in the area for school functions.
A letter dated February 20, 2018 signed by the Zonal Education Director P.N. Silva orders principals to give MPs due priority and respect when they attend such functions. The names of the said Provincial Council members representing the structural committee of the Colombo education zone was also annexed with the Director's letter.
The Ceylon Teachers Union General Secretary Joseph Stalin told Daily News that the Zonal Educational Office should immediately withdraw the letter. The people elected a Yahapalana government to prevent politicians poking their nose on matters related to schools. This whole system has been politicised and should be changed. Action must be taken for officials who act according to the will of the politicians, Stalin said.

World number one Halep crashes out of Miami Open
MIAMI, Sunday - World number one Simona Halep tumbled out of the Miami Open on Saturday, falling 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 to Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska.
The third-round defeat comes a week after Romania's Halep was toppled in the semi-finals at Indian Wells by Japan's Naomi Osaka, who went on to win the title in the California desert.
With the first set in hand, the mercurial Halep was clearly frustrated when Radwanska dropped just four points in the opening four games of the second to seize a 4-0 lead.
Halep reclaimed one break, but was broken again as Radwanska forced a third set, in which an early break put Halep up 2-0.
The Romanian couldn't maintain the advantage, however, and her 44 unforced errors were too much to overcome as Radwanska won six of the last seven games to seal the victory.
Radwanska, the 2012 Miami champion, hadn't posted back-to-back match victories since January.
She next faces former world number one Victoria Azarenka, who rallied for a 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory over 20th-seeded Latvian Anastasija Sevastova.
Azarenka, of Belarus, is unseeded this year as she tries to get her career back on track after taking time off to have a baby.
Despite the defeat, Halep is assured of retaining the number one spot when the rankings are updated at the end of the tournament. But her exit leaves the women's field in the elite hardcourt tournament without its top two seeds after second-seeded Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki lost to Monica Puig on Friday night.
Wozniacki was smarting Saturday, not from anything Puig offered on court but from what she said was threatening and vulgar behavior by fans at the match.
In a Twitter post, the Danish star called on Miami Open organizers to act after fans threatened her parents and swore at the niece and nephew of her fiance, David Lee.
During the match last night people in the crowd threatened my family, wished death upon my mom and dad, called me names that I can't repeat here and told my fiance's niece and nephew (who are 10 years old) to sit down and shut the f--- up, she said in a Twitter post.
Meanwhile security and staff did nothing to prevent this and even accepted this to take place, Wozniacki added.
Tournament director James Blake said player security was the event's No. 1 priority.
During the match, we had tournament and WTA staff, as well as tournament security courtside, Blake said in a statement. They never witnessed, nor were they notified of any specific threats made to the players or their families. If they had been notified, the situation would have been handled immediately.
In other third-round action, fifth-seeded Czech Karolina Pliskova defeated Taiwan's Hsieh Su-Wei 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (7/4). Pliskova will battle for a quarter-final berth against Zarina Diyas of Kazakhstan, who defeated German Carina Witthoeft 4-6, 7-5, 6-0. - AFP

Customer service cloud an emerging tool
Customer experience (CX) is fast emerging as a key competitive advantage in todays marketplace. In fact, according to Forbes Blake Morgan, 75% of companies set improving CX as an objective for 2018.
This is due largely to the way that technology can augment the relationship between businesses and customers, and the way that tech companies have disrupted industries by providing a superior customer experience. Industry leaders are now taking note and looking at how they can harness technology to create a more powerful customer experience. Sysco, the worlds largest foodservice company, is one of those leaders and together with Sysco LABS, they are reimagining the foodservice customer experience.
Customer experience is the product of the interactions between the customer and the organization over the duration of their relationship. Traditionally, CX was relegated to interactions that happened in stores and with salespeople or products, but the explosion of the online marketplace has changed the expectations of customers.
Rasika Karunatilake  Vice President, General Manager and Head of Shared Services at Sysco LABS in Sri Lanka
Along with being able to make purchases online, customers also expect organizations to behave more like their friends. For example, today an organization with a Facebook page will be expected to chat with customers through the messenger app, and most leading organizations will be expected to have mobile applications of their own to provide greater transparency and communication.
Todays CX improvements are numerous and diverse. Customers expect greater transparency on the supply chain and workflow of organizations - consider how it isnt enough to know that your Uber is arriving, you need to know exactly how many minutes away it is and see its location on a map. This practice is being adopted by more and more industries; from food delivery services to airlines, organizations are trying to communicate with customers in real time.
The customer service cloud is another emerging tool; using the massive amounts of data transactions produced, companies are able to not only save customers' time and effort, but also offer them fairer prices. In industries such as food supply, where the price of the commodity is prone to fluctuation based on supply and demand, cloud pricing allows organizations to use algorithms to assign the best price possible.
Another major area of innovation in CX is smart stores.
The implementation of augmented reality in stores is increasing dramatically; driven by advancements in the technology and in the internet of things, clothes retailers like Rebecca Minkoffs are using smart mirrors to help customers virtually try on clothes, see if the item is available in other sizes, colors and much more. Amazon too is breaking into this space following their acquisition of whole foods.
With Amazon Go they are creating grocery stores without checkout counters where customers are automatically charged for whatever they walk out with.
Sysco LABS is working on achieving this level of CX innovation in the foodservice industry. With a focus on Syscos entire foodservice chain, from farm to fork, Sysco LABS is reimagining every relationship with technology; the farmer and the food storage team, the relationship between the food delivery team and the restaurant operator, and the one between restaurants and customers. The innovations of the teams will ultimately allow restaurants to run smoother and grow by providing their customers with a better experience.
In re-imagining this process, Sysco and Sysco LABS will be employing four core principles. The first is customer-centricity; bringing the customer into the room and having them weigh in on CX design decisions.

UNP can correct its shortcomings
The United National Party (UNP) came second in the Local Government elections, but it can correct its shortcomings and go forward. The UNP received 33 percent of the total votes cast and the SLFP received 13 percent. People who received 13 percent votes cannot decide who should be the leader of the UNP, which received 33 percent of the votes, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
He was addressing the newly elected UNP members of the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council led by Chandana Lal Karunaratne at the Municipal Council after they took their oaths before him on March 23.
"A few parliamentarians cannot dictate terms to the UNP and appoint its leadership. No one will be allowed to dilute the UNP till people like Sajith Preamdasa and myself are in it. We will forge links with people and march forward. We, however, have to remedy our shortcomings expeditiously, Dissanayake said.
Dissanayake said it was a happy day for them since they had been able to set up the administration in several local councils including Nuwara Eliya and Kotmale. The UNP may set up administration in Hanguranketha and Walapone as well, he Minister said.
Minister Dissanayake said that as the UNP district leader in Nuwara Eliya, he was not happy about the UNP's overall performance countrywide during the local election.
It was more so because a powerful party like the UNP with a 70-year-old history had been beaten to second place by a fledgling party like the SLPP. The reasons adduced for the UNP's poor performance were that it failed to look after its supporters, resolve fertiliser problems, and provide jobs to party supporters. The other was that it had neglected its Sinhala-Buddhist vote base, he said. The Minister said that unless they corrected these shortcomings within the next two or three months, they would not be able to advance as a party.
They had already conveyed this message to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and briefed him on the need to re-organise the party, Dissanayake said.
Minister Dissanayake said that unlike the SLPP, the UNP had promising second level leaders like Sajith, Akila, Sagala, Harsha, Eran and few others and some duties and responsibilities in the party should be vested in them without restricting them to their ministry posts.
"The party needs a full time General Secretary who would work round the clock like the late Gamini Athukorale, who could be contacted on the phone round the clock. Electoral organisers of the UNP should be given more powers without making them co-organisers," he said.
Dissanayake said certain statements made by the President too impacted badly on the UNP performance at the elections. "If both the SLFP and UNP jointly contested under the 'Swan' symbol, they would have emerged victorious. The two government leaders failed to consider that strategy, the Minister said.

Afghanistan thrash Windies to win WC qualifying final
HARARE, Sunday: Mohammad Shahzad starred as Afghanistan laid down a marker ahead of next years World Cup by romping to a seven-wicket thrashing of the West Indies in Sundays qualifying final in Harare.
Leg-spin sensation Rashid Khan became the fastest bowler ever to reach 100 one-day international wickets as the Windies were bowled out for 204, before big-hitting opener Shahzad smashed 84 as Afghanistan knocked off the runs with 9.2 overs to spare.
Both Afghanistan and West Indies had already made sure of their places in the 2019 World Cup by topping the 10-team qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe.
West Indies star Chris Gayle capped a poor personal tournament as he was dismissed for only 10 by 16-year-old leg-spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman, who finished with 4-43.
Rovman Powell hit 44 as the two-time World Cup winners recovered to at least pass 200.
Rashid, 19, dismissed Shai Hope to take his 100th ODI wicket in only his 44th game, beating the previous record held by Australias Mitchell Starc by eight matches.
Shahzad played some remarkable shots in his 93-ball innings, clubbing 11 fours and two sixes before holing out to the part-time spin of Gayle. Rahmat Shah struck an assured 11th ODI half-century as Afghanistan cruised to victory to lift the troph
Scores:
West Indies 204 in 46.5 overs (Mujeeb Ur Rahman 4-43)
Afghanistan 206-3 in 40.4 overs (Mohammad Shahzad 84, Rahmat Shah 51). AFP

Antibiotics increase womens risk of death
Antibiotics increase womens risk of an early death from heart disease by inflicting irreparable damage on their gut lining, new research warns.
Those who are prescribed a dose that spans two months or more are 58 per cent more likely to succumb to terminal heart issues, the study found. In fact, their risk of premature death from all causes bumps up 27 per cent.
The findings come a month after the FDA warned people against a particularly common antibiotic sold under the brand name Biaxin - which is used to treat many skin, ear, sinus and lung infections - for its link to potentially fatal heart issues.
The study is one of the first to quantify how much antibiotics affect the gut lining and heart health. While previous studies have found antibiotic use is associated with long-lasting changes to gut microbiota, no study had examined how significant this damage would be for relatively healthy people.
Gut microbiota alterations have been associated with a variety of life-threatening disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer, said lead author Dr. Lu Qi, Professor of Epidemiology at Tulane University.
Antibiotic exposure affects balance and composition of the gut microbiome, even after one stops taking antibiotics.
So, it is important to better understand how taking antibiotics might impact risks for chronic diseases and death, he explained. In a collaborative study with Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Qi led a team studying 37,510 women over the age of 60 who did not have heart disease or cancer at the start of the program, which spanned from 2004 until summer 2012.
Assessing each womans antibiotic use, they put them into four groups, fewer than 15 days; between 15 days and two months; or two or more months. By the end, they found a clear correlation between antibiotic use and premature death risk, particularly if the course was longer.
Women who took antibiotics for two months or longer, were 27 per cent more likely to die from any cause except cancer than those who took no antibiotics at all. Death risk was higher still if these women had a history of antibiotic use in their middle age too.
Although we observed a notable association between long-term antibiotic use and risk of death, it isnt yet clear whether long-term antibiotic use is the specific cause of the association, Dr Qi said.

Sumana Perera
A dynamic nurse
Life is a splendid gift. There is nothing small about it. - Florence Nightingale
Our country lost an illustrious nightingale of our own who was greatly inspired by the above quote from the role model of her profession, when nursing professional Sumana Perera passed away recently.
Nursing always held a great appeal as a vocation for Sumana since her childhood. As a child, she had taken interest and pleasure in treating injured pets. So when she was selected to undergo training as a nurse at the age of 20 in 1963, it was more a fulfilment of a cherished ambition than an initial step into a lifelong career.
Sumana would often tell this writer who first came to know her as a fellow employee of the Health Department and later, as the wife of a close friend, I came into nursing by choice, not by accident.
Soon after graduating from the Post-Basic School, Sumana was promoted as a nursing sister and assigned to the National Hospital Accident Service Unit. Later, authorities appointment Sumana Sister-in-Charge of the Medical Intensive Care Unit which was opened by former late President J. R. Jayewardene. She was promoted to Matron soon afterwards.
She later won a scholarship to undergo training in specialised nursing care for trauma victims, in Finland. On her return to the island upon completing the training course, she was briefly the Gampaha General Hospital Matron. By this time, arrangements were being made to shift the Accident Service Unit of the National Hospital to a new building and Sumana was transferred back to the unit to take over as its matron.
Sumana was appointed the National Hospital Chief Nursing Officer in 1992. She assumed duties as a Director of Nursing at the Health Ministry in 2000 and continued to serve in this capacity until her retirement in 2002.
According to her colleagues, Sumana was inspired by the illustrious career and writings of Florence Nightingale and would often cite her quotes to inspire her peers and subordinates.
Following is one of the popular quotes from Florence Nightingale which she often cited:
If a patient is cold, if a patient is feverish, if a patient is faint, if he is sick after taking food, if he has a bed sore, it is generally the fault not of the disease, but of the nursing.
After her marriage to former Lake House Director D. K. Somasiri, Sumana, a human dynamo, found time to extend her active support to social service projects her husband was involved in, as an active member of the Ganemulla Lions Club.
She was a life-member of the Sri Lanka Nurses Association and held key posts within it from time to time. She also took a keen interest in the activity of the Graduate Nurses' Foundation from its inception. In fact, she was among the first batch of BSc Nursing graduates that passed out from the Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL).
Sumana leaves her husband D. K. Somasiri and daughter Nadeesha Jayamaha.
I wish to conclude this appreciation with the famous quote:
Death leaves a heartache that no one can heal; love leaves a memory no one can steal.
May she attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

N. Pathmanathan
Pillar of strength
Namasivayam Pathmanathan was the first officer to gain entry into the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS) in the Batticaloa District, in 1967. He passed the open competitive examination conducted by the Examinations Commissioner General. He passed away on March 4, 2018.
Pathmanathan was a past pupil of Shivanadha Vidyalaya (Rama Kirishnan Mission), which has produced numerous SLAS Officers including I. Shivanadha, at that time, was the leading English Medium School in the District.
V. Thiyahalingam of Huskison Street, Trincomalee, was my classmate at Shivanadha Vidyalaya as well as at the School of Agriculture, Peradeniya, where we completed our Diploma Course in Agriculture. It is he who connected me to late Pathmanathan, who invited me to serve at the Trincomalee Provincial Council Office when he was the first Chief Secretary to the Provincial Council of the North and East. Then the Chief Minister was Varatharaja Perumal. Thiyahalingam currently now working in London.
Late N. Pathmanathan had held a number of executive posts, such as Government Agent, Deputy District Secretariat Treasury Secretary, Finance Ministry Budget Director and several other high-ranking positions.
Lastly, he was appointed the Rehabilitation of Persons, properties and industries Authority (REPPIA) Chairman by the Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Minister.
Having passed the G. C. E (O/L) and G. C. E. (A/L), he also served as a Teacher in English at St. Michael's College, Batticaloa, until he entered the University of Peradeniya.
He was a pillar of strength to all those who came met with. He was also the District Governor to rotary clubs in the Batticaloa District from 2002  2003. This loss leaves a void that could never be filled.
I convey my deepest condolences to the members of the bereaved family of late Namasivayam Pathmanathan. May his soul rest in peace.

Sylvia Weerasinghe
Woman of unwavering faith
The weight of this sad time we must obey. Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say. The oldest hath borne most. We that are here shall never see so much nor live so long. - William Shakespeare
I feel a void left by your absence. I miss you dearly. You were more of a mother than a friend to Hillary and I. We were blessed to have you in our lives. I will remember all the times you prayed for us, those wake-up calls to check after a court hearing, because a squatter illegally occupied our home.
We remember all the special and vivid memories, images of our Sunday evenings at Calvary Church, when we looked forward to attending service and meeting you. We could never forget you visiting us in Oman, the happiness of having you in our home and of those meetings where the Expatriate Christian Community in that part of the world, were blessed to meet you and hear the word of God.
During that time, our spiritual life changed as well, while we watched you pray regularly at dawn. All this is in the prism of our memory. Those were the brightest images from the stream of time that we have of you, our beloved Aunty Sylvia. Your constant communication, reassuring care and concern, touched the core of many for sure. Our hearts will always hold safe the love and care you had for Hillary and I.
You always reminded us of faith, that no matter what, even if life turns cold at times, Gods love and tenderness will pull us through the roughest of waters. Your beloved children and family have inherited the same esteemed love you had for God, which accompanied you every step and in every path of your life. You lived in the light of your faith and your values.
Many would speak of you and share their thoughts of your remarkable and unshakable faith in God. How can we forget that smile of yours, which always meant so much to those who met youthat smile that will never be lost, beaming in the marvelous splendor of Heaven. We here on earth, will always love you and miss you so much.

Marhooma Florine
Vibrant personality
Those we love go away
They walk beside us everyday
Years may pass and fade away
But memories of loved ones are here to stay
The Malay world was made to look the poorer by the untimely demise of one of its vibrant personalities who graced many an occasion with her witty and active participation.
Marhooma Florine was a hands-on individual who would do her utmost to alleviate the hardships faced by the underprivileged with her persuasive tactics and she would walk the extra mile to garner the necessary donations, whatever the cause may be, but never at a loss to meet her desired goals.
A product of Ladies' College, she never lost common touch as she was able to move with the highs and lows of society as she was a prominent participant in all activities in which she saw her stewardship prosper.
She was always at her best at any occasion; she would stir up proceedings at any get-together, break into song and dance, filling the occasion with rapture, with her sterling performances. How we miss her in her absence, will be felt by all the institutions to which she lent her patronage.
I would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to her dearly beloved husband, Laddie, who stood by her at all times and to her children and their extended families.
Death is not the greatest loss in life; the greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live.

Asian markets tumble as Trump sparks trade war fears
Asian markets plunged on Friday following a sell-off in New York as Donald Trump sparked fresh trade war fears by imposing huge tariffs on Chinese imports and Beijing unveiled its own measures against US goods.The president announced levies on up to US$60 billion of imports from China for what he describes as the theft of American intellectual property, fuelling speculation that a strong recovery in the world economy could be thrown off course.Thursdays announcement comes just weeks after the White House imposed stinging taxes on steel and aluminium products entering the US causing equities to plunge as Trump drives through with his America First protectionist agenda.China responded by saying it was not afraid of a trade war, while it also released a list of potential tariffs on US$3 billion worth of US goods, from pork to fruits and wine and including some steel and aluminium goods.
The news boosted Chinese pork producers though Hong Kong-listed WH Group, which owns US giant Smithfield, plunged eight percent.
There was little positive reaction to the US saying late Thursday it would suspend duties on metals imports from the EU, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea.
Wall Street was sent spiralling by Thursdays news with all three main indexes shedding between 2.4 percent and 2.9 percent.And those losses filtered through to Asia. Tokyo was hammered 4.5 percent to hit a near six-month low, with exporters also hit by a surging yen, which is considered the go-to currency in times of turmoil and uncertainty.
The greenback fell below 105 yen for the first time since Trump was elected president in November 2016, while it was also down against the euro and pound.
Hong Kong collapsed 3.4 percent and Shanghai lost 4.2 percent, while Sydney sank two percent.Hannah Anderson, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, warned: The effects are likely to be felt more strongly in the US and increase both consumer and producer prices.
Exports are extremely important to the Chinese economy, but have been trending less so in recent years and the US has been shrinking as a share of Chinas export market. AFP

Atherton says premeditated Australia bang to rights over ball-tampering
LONDON, Saturday: Michael Atherton said the premeditated nature of Australia's ball-tampering during the ongoing third Test against South Africa made it different from the dirt in pocket affair that blighted his career.
Australia captain Steve Smith dramatically admitted his side were guilty of ball-tampering after the third day's play in Cape Town on Saturday.
He added the senior leadership group had spoken about breaking one of the Laws of Cricket during the lunch interval before team-mate Cameron Bancroft did so -- and then tried to hide his offence from the on-field umpires -- in the next session of play.
Back in 1994, then England captain Atherton was seen taking dirt from his pocket and rubbing it on the ball during a Test against South Africa at Lord's.
He was later fined 2,000 for failing to disclose the dirt to the match referee but remained as England captain despite calls for his resignation.
But Atherton said the deliberate nature of Australia's actions, allied to the fact it involved a junior team member in the 25-year-old Bancroft, appearing in just his eighth Test, made it a different case to his own.

Australias day of shame ends in 322-run rout
CAPE TOWN, Sunday: Australian crickets day of shame ended in a crushing 322-run defeat by South Africa on the fourth day of the the third Test at Newlands on Sunday.
Set an unlikely 430 to win, Australia were bowled out for a paltry 107, with fast bowler Morne Morkel taking five for 23.
It was a fittingly dismal end to the match for Australia after they were caught up in a ball-tampering scandal on Saturday which sent shockwaves through the sport.
Skipper Steve Smith was subsequently banned for one match by the ICC, just hours after he and vice-captain David Warner had stood down from their positions for the remainder of the match.
Its been a horrible 24 hours -- I want apologise to our fans and those back home, said stand-in skipper Tim Paine.
The Australians had already woken to bruising criticism from their own chief executive and prime minister, as well as condemnation from around the cricket world.
It followed the admission by Smith and young batsman Cameron Bancroft that they had deliberately tried to change the condition of the ball on Saturday.
The day seldom got any better.
Tim Paine and his bowlers could not stop South Africa from taking their second innings total to 373.
Embattled opening batsmen Bancroft and Warner weathered a challenging 70 minutes before tea at the start of their second innings before the run-out of Bancroft sparked a collapse in which all ten wickets fell for just 50 runs in 19.3 overs and 99 minutes.
Bancroft fell to a direct hit from midwicket by South African captain Faf du Plessis after being called for a risky single by Warner. - AFP

CAPE TOWN, Saturday: Australia ball-tampering scandal -- who's saying what:
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and I want to be here (the press conference) because I'm accountable for my actions. I'm not proud of what's happened. I've got to live with the consequences and the damage to my own reputation that comes with. -- Cameron Bancroft
I'll be honest, I was nervous about it because with hundreds of cameras around that's always the risk. -- Bancroft
The leadership group knew about it. We spoke about it at lunch. I'm not proud of what happened. It's not in the spirit of the game. -- Captain Steve Smith
My integrity, the team's integrity, the leadership group's integrity has come into question and rightfully so. I am embarrassed to be sitting here and talking about this. We're in the middle of such a great series. For something like this to overshadow the great cricket that has been played and not have a single cricket question in here, that's not what I'm about and what the team is about. It's big error in judgment but we'll learn from this and move past it. -- Smith
We spoke about it and thought it was a possible way to get an advantage. -- Smith
No I won't. I still think I'm the right person for the job. -- Smith says he will not resign
The Captain of Australia admits to cheating... put him on a plane out of here Cricket Australia. Your Legacy deserves better. -- Former South Africa spinner Pat Symcox on Twitter
This was a premeditated attempt by the Australian team to cheat. -- Former England captain Nasser Hussain
Shocked & disappointed. -- Former Australian fast bowler Mitchell Johnson
Disappointing and disgraceful........ a shocking day for the baggy green. -- Ex-Aussie fast bowler Craig McDermott
I feel a bit for Cameron Bancroft because I don't think he's taken it upon himself to do something and put it in his pocket. Who's told him to do that It's important to find out that. I think we've got to get to the bottom of why that has happened and what was it. You've got to own up. You've been caught, you've got to own up and say what was it you were hiding. You can't have that in the game. -- Ex-Aussie star Shane Warne
WHAT THE ........ HAVE I JUST WOKEN UP TO. Please tell me this is a bad dream. -- Michael Clarke, who was Australia captain before Smith
Steve Smith,his Team & ALL the management will have to accept that whatever happens in their careers they will all be known for trying to CHEAT the game ... #SAvAUS. -- Ex-England skipper Michael Vaughan
In my opinion he has tampered with the ball, and used an object to do that. Clearly he's hiding something away from the umpires and when they approach him he pulls something outside of his pocket. -- South Africa's former captain Graeme Smith on TV commentary
My 2cents worth - This will be Darren Lehmann's greatest test as a coach, cos I will struggle to believe that this was all Bancroft's idea. #SandpaperGate. -- Kevin Pietersen on Twitter. Smith insists that Lehmann was not involved
In tennis, players can skip the mandatory press conference, if they pay a hefty fine. I imagine if that option was available in cricket, CA would be writing a cheque right now. #damagecontrol. -- Former India women's player Snehal Pradhan. - AFP

Amid ball-tampering probe
Australia skipper Smith banned by ICC
CAPE TOWN, Sunday: Steve Smith stepped down as Australia captain on Sunday and has been suspended for one test by the International Cricket Council amid stunning ball-tampering revelations that have plunged the test team into crisis.
Smith was also fined 100 percent of his match fee, while opening batsman Cameron Bancroft, who was caught on camera attempting to alter the condition of the ball, was handed three demerit points and a 75 percent fine of his match fee.
Bancroft, however, escaped a ban and is therefore free to play in the fourth test starting in Johannesburg on Friday if selected.
David Warner also resigned as vice-captain on Sunday amid shock and disappointment at the conduct of the team back home.
Cricket Australia said Smith and Warner had agreed to give up their leadership roles following discussions with the governing body, with wicketkeeper Tim Paine to take the reins for the remainder of the third test in Cape Town and mostly likely now the fourth.
This test match needs to proceed, and in the interim we will continue to investigate this matter with the urgency that it demands, CA CEO James Sutherland said in a statement.
Cricket Australia and Australian cricket fans expect certain standards of conduct from cricketers representing our country, and on this occasion these standards have not been met.
All Australians, like us, want answers and we will keep you updated on our findings, as a matter of priority.
Smith and Warners demotion came hours after Australias Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull heaped pressure on CA to act swiftly and decisively.
I have to say that the whole nation which holds those who wear the baggy green up on a pedestal about as high as you can get in Australia, certainly higher than any politician thats for sure, this is a shocking disappointment, Turnbull said.
Smith had admitted on Saturday that the ball-tampering carried out by Bancroft had been orchestrated by himself and senior players but although he was embarrassed by the scandal, he had no intention of stepping down as skipper. -Agencies

Being Black in America
Black boys raised in America, even in the wealthiest families and living in some of the most well-to-do neighbourhoods, still earn less in adulthood than white boys with similar backgrounds, according to a new study that traced the lives of millions of children in the USA. White boys who grow up rich are likely to remain that way. Black boys raised at the top, however, are more likely to become poor than to stay wealthy in their own adult households. Even when children grow up next to each other with parents who earn similar incomes, black boys fare worse than white boys in 99 percent of America. Large income gaps persist between men  but not women.
Black men consistently earn less than white men, regardless of whether theyre raised poor or rich.
According to the study, led by researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, income inequality between blacks and whites is driven entirely by what is happening among these boys and the men they become. Though black girls and women face deep inequality on many measures, black and white girls from families with comparable earnings attain similar individual incomes as adults.
Income inequality
You would have thought at some point you escape the poverty trap, said Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist and an author of the study. The study, based on anonymous earnings and demographic data for virtually all Americans now in their late 30s, debunks a number of other widely held hypotheses about income inequality. Gaps persisted even when black and white boys grew up in families with the same income, similar family structures, similar education levels and even similar levels of accumulated wealth.
The disparities that remain also cant be explained by differences in cognitive ability, an argument made by people who cite racial gaps in test scores that appear for both black boys and girls. A more likely possibility, the authors suggest, is that test scores dont accurately measure the abilities of black children in the first place.
If this inequality cant be explained by individual or household traits, much of what matters probably lies outside the home  in surrounding neighbourhoods, in the economy and in a society that views black boys differently from white boys, and even from black girls.
One of the most popular liberal post-racial ideas is the idea that the fundamental problem is class and not race, and clearly this study explodes that idea, said IbramKendi, a professor and director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University. But for whatever reason, were unwilling to stare racism in the face.
The authors, including the Stanford economist Raj Chetty and two census researchers, Maggie R. Jones and Sonya R. Porter, tried to identify neighborhoods where poor black boys do well, and as well as whites.
The few neighbourhoods that met this standard were in areas that showed less discrimination in surveys and tests of racial bias. They mostly had low poverty rates. And, intriguingly, these pockets  including parts of the Maryland suburbs of Washington, and corners of Queens and the Bronx  were the places where many lower-income black children had fathers at home. Poor black boys did well in such places, whether their own fathers were present or not.
The research makes clear that there is something unique about the obstacles black males face. The gap between Hispanics and whites is narrower, and their incomes will converge within a couple of generations if mobility stays the same. Asian-Americans earn more than whites raised at the same income level, or about the same when first-generation immigrants are excluded. Only Native Americans have an income gap comparable to African-Americans. But the disparities are widest for black boys.
Sexism and racism
Lives of 20 million children born between 1978 and 1983 are reflected in the study. Using census data that included tax files, the researchers were able to link the adult fortunes of those children to their parents incomes. Names and addresses were hidden from the researchers.
Previous research suggests some reasons there may be a large income gap between black and white men, but not between women, even though women of colour face both sexism and racism.
Other studies show that boys, across races, are more sensitive than girls to disadvantages like growing up in poverty or facing discrimination. While black women also face negative effects of racism, black men often experience racial discrimination differently. As early as preschool, they are more likely to be disciplined in school. They are pulled over or detained and searched by police officers more often.
The new data shows that 21 percent of black men raised at the very bottom were incarcerated, according to a snapshot of a single day during the 2010 census. Black men raised in the top 1 percent  by millionaires  were as likely to be incarcerated as white men raised in households earning about $36,000.
At the same time, boys benefit more than girls from adult attention and resources, as do low-income and nonwhite children, a variety of studies have found. Mentors who arent childrens parents, but who share those childrens gender and race, serve a particularly important role for black children, Ms. Hurd has found.
That helps explain why the presence of black fathers in a neighborhood, even if not in a childs home, appears to make a difference.
Some of the widest black-white income gaps in this study appear in wealthy communities. This fits with previousresearch that has shown that the effects of racial discrimination cross class lines. Although all children benefit from growing up in places with higher incomes and more resources, black children do not benefit nearly as much as white children do. Moving black boys to opportunity is no guarantee they can tap into it.
Other research findings
This study makes it possible to look in greater detail at interrelated disparities that researchers have long studied around income, marriage rates and incarceration. Here are some of the other findings.
Theres a large gap in the marriage rates of white and black Americans, even after accounting for income. One reason income gaps between whites and blacks appear so large at the household level is that black men and women are less likely to be married. That means their households are more likely to have a single income  not two. If black children dont have married parents, the argument goes, theyre more likely to grow up with fewer resources and less adult attention at home.
Poor children appeared to have less opportunity in the Southeast and more in the Northern Great Plains. With the new data, its now possible to look at the effects of geography separately for blacks and whites.
Poor white children struggle in parts of the Southeast and Appalachia. But they still fare better there than poor black children do in most of America. In effect, the worst places for whites produce outcomes that are about as good as the best places for blacks. These new maps also suggest that part of the reason the Southeast looks bad for all children, in the middle map, is that the region is home to many black children who fare particularly poorly there.
African-Americans made up about 35 percent of all children raised in the bottom 1 percent of the income distribution.
They made up less than 1 percent of the children at the very top. This picture captures both a source of racial inequality and a consequence of it. White children are more likely to start life with economic advantages. But we now know that even when they start with the same advantages as black children, white boys still fare better, only reinforcing the disparities seen here.
In reality, whites and blacks are not represented equally across the income spectrum. More than two-thirds of black boys are raised by poor or lower-middle-class families, while more than half of white boys are raised by rich or upper-middle-class families. What the article shows America has a long way to go equalise life for the Black community.

A bouquet to Rajitha
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has come in for a lot of praise for the steps he has taken to bring relief to the public by reducing the prices of certain essential drugs. It goes without saying that medication is as important as food for survival for a certain category of patients who are sustained by drugs. In most instances they are left without the wherewithal to purchase their drugs and are dependent on their offspring or family members. Hence, the high cost of drugs may pose a burden to the entire family, as well.
It is essential that drug prices are kept to a minimum so that they will be affordable to the perennially ailing, particularly those in the evening of their life. To this category belong the pensioners whose eternal lament has been that they are unable to purchase life saving drugs due to their high prices, with the meagre sum they receive as pensions, going by the public columns of the newspapers. It is this vulnerable sections that are mostly at risk due to vital drugs being beyond their purse.
The ministers move to reduce the prices of certain essential drugs will therefore be of immense relief to these sections. The minister has slashed the prices of 48 essential drugs. In India the prices of some 600 vital drugs have been reduced. It would be most welcome if the Dr. Senaratne considers reducing the prices of at least 100 drugs, if not more. True, the price reduction of essential drugs effected by the minister did not endear himself to the multinational drug companies, known for their penchant for unconscionable profits. Perhaps, this also alienated the minister from the GMOA, and, most attributed the doctors running battle with the minister to this factor. It is well known how pharmaceutical company representatives visit government doctors during duty time and occupy their time in lengthy sales talk, to the neglect of patients. It is also well known how doctors receive foreign trips, curtsy these pharmaceutical companies, as quid pro quo. Hence, the rumours connecting the government doctors with these pharmaceutical companies and this forming the basis for their animosity with the minister could not be entirely unfounded. Still, the minister deserves praise for standing up to the pharmaceutical mafia and taking the side of the poor patients, by his bold decision to slash the prices of essential drugs.
In fact Minister Senaratne has gone one better and taken steps to reduce the cost of certain treatments provided at private hospitals. A gazette notification on controlling 50 different treatments provided by private hospitals will be issued soon, Dr. Senaratne told parliament on Thursday. I have already discussed the matter with the office bearers of the Private Hospital Owners Association (PHOA) and informed them that charges will be controlled and a gazette issued shortly, the minister stated. Earlier the minister also reduced the VAT imposed on charges levied by private hospitals in relation to certain tests carried out and also consultant fees, which, no doubt, would have endeared himself to the public, who, hitherto, had been forced to pay astronomical amounts by way of private hospital bills even for the simplest of treatments.
However, the private hospitals could offset these positive steps by recourse to other means to fleece the sick. It is common knowledge that doctors at these private hospitals order numerous tests on their patients that in most instances are superfluous and they (patients) are billed huge sums for these tests. The patients are left with no option but submit to these tests rather than take a chance. True, there is nothing that the minister could do to check the authenticity of these tests. This could well be the reason that he has thought of controlling the cost of certain treatments at private hospitals, which is to be commended.
Other measures too should also be adopted to force these private hospitals to fall in line. Today, private hospitals are in huge demand and are patronized by even the ordinary folk due to the poor facilities at the state hospitals. The public also prefer the personalized attention they receive at private hospitals and the pleasant atmosphere, compared to the poorly run government hospitals. There are also special state of the art facilities at these private hospitals that are lacking in government hospitals that draw the public to the former. Of course the state medical institutions are much improved today, compared to the past, with up to date facilities in most of them. Yet, the unkempt and chaotic state of government hospitals force the public to seek private medical care much against their will. Hence, this situation needs remedying.
There is also the crying need for more doctors in the country. Recent media reports shed light on the fact we are short of some 8,000 doctors. The recent strike action by medical students over the SAITM issue only went on to aggravate the situation. Immediate measures are called for to address this problem. A moratorium should be placed on doctors seeking greener pastures abroad for a certain period so that the country avails itself of their services. After all, their education was paid for by the public.

LONDON, Saturday - Cambridge comfortably beat Oxford to win the 164th mens Varsity boat race on a gloomy River Thames on Saturday.
The bulkier light blues boat quickly pulled ahead at the start and they never wavered over the 6.8km course.
By the time the boats reached Hammersmith Bridge, Cambridge were nine seconds ahead and the second half of the race was a procession as they crossed the line nearly four lengths clear.
Every other race Ive done here, Ive felt so nervous, but I felt really calm, Cambridge cox Hugo Ramambason said.
We wanted to get a good start, keep moving, and earn the right to win the race. Last year was real tough, but the attitude in the squad has been so good.
Cambridge also won the earlier womens race by an even larger margin while both Cambridge reserve crews won their races on a day of complete domination.
Oxford had won four of the previous five mens races. Cambridge lead the overall series 83-80.  Agencies

Canada-funded research bears fruit for SL farmers
The launch of two new research-developed products to enhance the preservation of fruits was held recently in Colombo, with the participation of Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha and the High Commissioner of Canada to Sri Lanka, David McKinnon.
The Canadian International Food Security Research Fund (CIFSRF)  an initiative of Global Affairs Canada and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC)  supported a partnership between the University of Guelph in Canada and Indian and Sri Lankan institutes, as well as research and development organizations from three other developing countries, to address post-harvest losses of fruits in South Asia.
In Sri Lanka, the research was undertaken by the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) of the Science, Technology and Research Ministry through a grant of CAD 790,112 (approximately Rs. 94 million) over a six-year period (20122018) for the project titled Enhancing Preservation of Fruits Using Nanotechnology.
The research targeted post-harvest loss, reduction of high-value Sri Lankan fruits and maintenance of their quality for obtaining premium prices in the domestic and export markets. Poor handling of fruit results in post-harvest losses of nearly 40 percent in developing countries, including Sri Lanka.
The research scientists utilizing cutting-edge nanotechnology successfully developed two new products to extend and optimize the use of hexanal for pre- and post-harvest applications to commercial fruits, such as bananas, papayas and citrus.
Hexanal, a natural compound that can delay the ripening of fruits is a highly volatile molecule, but nanotechnology regulates the release of the compound, successfully preserving the fruit. The research work has included an extensive study of the biosafety of hexanal with data clearly showing that hexanal is harmless to honey bees, natural pest enemies, earthworms and is safe for humans.
The Bio-Wax and Tree Fresh Formulation (TFF) developed by the scientists are edible formulations with the added advantage of not only reducing moisture loss, but also reducing loss due to spoilage caused by post-harvest diseases. The innovative products are eco and environmentally friendly and would ensure international food safety standards. The two new products developed through this research were launched for commercial production by Hayleys Agriculture Holdings Ltd, at this ceremony.
The project has also extended collaboration to another Canada-funded project, namely, the Agro-Economic Development Project (ADP) implemented by UNDP.
The technology was provided to Nirveli Banana Producers and Processors Association in Jaffna to process waste material from banana fibre extraction to produce environmentally friendly bio-degradable paper products which can be used in place of the polyethylene covering currently used during transportation and distribution of fruits.
The innovative products will significantly reduce post-harvest losses, improving incomes and livelihoods of smallholder fruit farmers, and also provide new economic opportunities for women farmers engaged in post-harvest operations and contribute towards Sri Lankas economic development.

Ceylon Chamber of Commerce  marks 179 years
Sri Lankas premier business chamber completed 179 years of steadfast service to the nation yesterday, March 25th, 2018.
This marks a commendable achievement for the organization, which has continued to play a pivotal role in the business landscape of Sri Lanka, since its inception in the 19th century.
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce was established in 1839. Between 1834 and 1837 a few Chambers of Commerce had already been established in the region  in Bengal (1834), Bombay and Madras (1836) in India, in Canton in China (1834), in Penang in Malaysia (1837) and in Singapore (1837). At the time, Ceylon was under British rule as were India, Singapore, Malaysia and a part of China. This group of Asian Chambers are known to have been among the earliest to be set up anywhere in the world.
The decisive nudge to establish a Chamber of Commerce in Ceylon came from Governor Stewart Mackenzie who was keenly interested in promoting Ceylons Agriculture and Trade. Since then, the Ceylon Chamber has evolved and continues to represent the interest of diverse sectors of business, and continues to foster and protect the growing commerce of Ceylon.
In 1839 the Ceylon Chamber commenced with a membership of eleven (11) and 179 years later, the Chamber counts a direct membership of 618 Members, 35 Affiliated Associations, and a cumulative outreach of over 8,500 companies island wide.
Over the years, the Chamber has remained a proud institution whilstproviding service and sound leadership to all industry and service sectors. The Chamber will continue to uphold its Ten Principles of Governance which stands for the development of the Sri Lankan industry at large. Being a responsible voice and a formidable advocate, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce truly is the premier forum for business.
The Secretary General and its CEO Dhara Wijayatilake noted that, The reasons that inspired the formation of the Chamber 179 years ago, remain valid even today and it is with a sense of satisfaction that we note the achievements in realizing the goals the Chamber has set for itself.
This year the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce specially celebrates the launch of its revamped web platforms, chamber.lk, along with economy.lk and the launch of a new web portal bizinfo.lk which are scheduled to take place shortly.
We are excited to reveal the new platforms which will provide efficient means of dissemination of information, and deliver a more welcoming and resourceful experience to its users.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have finally sent out the 600 invitations to their eagerly anticipated May wedding after months of fevered anticipation.
Some 600 guests will attend Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding service at St. George's Chapel before they all make their way to a lunchtime reception at St. George's Hall, which is being given by the Queen.
Later that evening, 200 guests are invited to the private reception at Frogmore House given by The Prince of Wales. The invitation stipulates a strict dress code with men asked to don military uniform - likely to be worn by Harry, a former soldier who is now Captain General of Royal Marines - or a morning coat and lounge hat, with women asked to wear a day dress and hat.
The invitations, posted this week, have been produced by company Barnard & Westwood, which has held a royal warrant for printing and bookbinding by appointment to the Queen since 1985.
Using American ink on English card, the invites feature printed italic writing and are issued under Charles's name and bear his heraldic feathers embossed in gold at the top. Each invitation was printed by Lottie Small, who recently completed her apprenticeship on a machine from the 1930s that she affectionately nicknamed 'Maude'.
The invitations are similar to the ones sent out for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in 2011 - although these were in a different font and were issued with the Queen's royal cypher.
The invitations read: 'His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales KG KT requests the pleasure of the company of....... at the marriage of His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales with Ms Meghan Markle at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on Saturday 19th May, 2018 at 12 Noon followed by a reception at Windsor Castle.'
The royal couple will marry at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle on May 19, with millions of people expected to watch around the world. They will then embark on a carriage procession around the Berkshire town, cheered by residents and visitors, before a reception at St. George's Hall. A smaller number of guests will join them at the evening receptions hosted by Prince Charles. The Queen will attend, as will the rest of the royal family, along with Markle's parents Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland.
Prince George and Princess Charlotte are likely to take on the roles of pageboy and bridesmaid. The royal family is paying for the wedding, including the church service, the music, the flowers and the reception. But the security costs for the high-profile event are being covered by the state.
Harry proposed to Suits star Markle during a cosy night in over a roast chicken dinner after a 16-month whirlwind romance. In his engagement interview he told of how 'the stars were aligned' when he fell for his future wife, whom he met on a blind date.
The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will marry the couple and the Rt Rev David Conner, Dean of Windsor, will conduct the service at the Castle's 15th century chapel.

Minister to the badge of office
It is very strange that a veteran parliamentarian, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, has raised a question in parliament whether Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, Minister for Regional Development, could wear his military uniform when attending parliament. Surely he should have known that there is a dress code for parliamentarians. Here, it would be interesting to know Arvindh Kumar, Badulla MP, was not allowed to enter the House as he was wearing a dark orange colour shirt.
The Sergeant-at-Arms, Anil Samerasekera had said, dark coloured shirts are not allowed and they should wear either the national dress or lounge and women parliamentarians, Sarees and long sleeve blouses. Sleeveless not allowed.
In 2009, TNA MP for Batticaloa, Thangeswary Kathiraman, it was reported, was ordered to leave the House as she was wearing a Shalwar-Kameez. A. R. Anjan Umma of the JVP was allowed to come in Abaya and Hijab after obtaining prior permission and so are the Muslim Members to come in their religiously prescribed dress. It was also reported that Srimani Athulathmudali was not allowed to enter as she was wearing a skirt and blouse.
I remember a very interesting incident when we had to attend parliament during Committee Stage of the Budget, when our Ministry votes were taken up. Officials had to occupy the Official Box, and permission was granted only to those who either wore the national dress or lounge  coat and tie. It so happened that our Accountant walked in wearing only a shirt and tie, without a coat. That was the first time he was attending parliament.
He was politely told by the Arachchi that he cannot be allowed entry as he was not properly dressed with a coat. Soon, I had to come to his rescue. Seeing an officer, a friend, from another Ministry leaving, after his business was over, I asked him for his coat, explaining the predicament we were in and made our Accountant put it on. What a sight it was. An oversized coat, touching almost his knee. However, the problem was solved, as the Arachchi allowed him in.

Colombo to endure severe  Grade A office space shortage
There would be a great demand for Grade A office spaces in Colombo, said global real estate consultancy Jones Lang La Salle (JLL) JLL, Lanka, Managing Director Steven Mayes.
The existing stock of office space in the grade A sector in Colombo is just over 1.5 million square feet. When considered in the context of anticipated total demand for Grade A in 2018, at around 5 million square feet, it is very apparent that there is a shortage of about 200% in supply. Absorption of most Grade B spaces have also seen an uptick, as occupiers run out of Grade A options and are forced to compromise with alternatives.
Steven Mayes
We remain optimistic about the commercial sector real estate space, he noted However, we are advising our clients to remain cautious about retail and residential markets, both of which face challenges going forward.
The commercial sector continues to gather pace buoyed by strong demand, especially in the international grade A space which is currently undersupplied in Colombo 1, 2 and 3.
The residential sector, especially high end condominiums, faces over supply challenges, with the recent re-imposition of 15% VAT on condominium sales, denting sentiment further. Retail markets too demonstrate less sustainability, in the medium to longer term, due to the considerable number of ongoing mall development projects.
While an uptick in demand is expected for spaces in Colombo from IT and related sectors stemming from 2018 budget provisions for the sector, it would be prudent to note that IT companies typically prefer out of town locations and lower cost options to fit with their business model. Infrastructure development focused on connectivity between Colombo and Kandy could potentially increase tourism activity, further infrastructure developments, logistics activity, and generate more general business, which will bring in more demand for office space in both cities.
Prospects for the retail sector look encouraging over 2018/19, but beyond this lies potential excess supply issues. While the ongoing mall developments will experience the first-mover advantage, those that follow may experience demand related issues due to a lack of brands to occupy space.
In current retail outlets demand for space still outstrips supply, but the gap will narrow after 2019, with other malls coming on stream in central and secondary business districts and residential zones.

Commercial Bank celebrates 15 years of remittance services in Kuwait
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon recently hosted the management and employees of Exchange Houses and the Banks premier customers in Kuwait at an event commemorating 15 years of remittance services to Sri Lanka from the Arabian Gulf state.
Kandeepan Bala, the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Kuwait was Chief Guest at the event, and in his speech, commended the role played by Commercial Bank to help Sri Lankans working in Kuwait.
Commercial Banks Managing Director, Jegan Durairatnam and a team of officers including Head of Remittances, Pradeep Banduwansa represented the Bank at the event.
The event took place at the Radisson Blu hotel Kuwait, in the famous ship-shaped AlHashemi Grand Ballroom, with the Channa Upuli Dance troupe and Sri Lankan pop, R&B and jazz singer Umaria entertaining guests. The Commercial Bank of Ceylon began its remittance operations in Kuwait in March 2003. Kuwait is a key market for worker remittances with around 100,000 Sri Lankans employed in the state. Commercial Bank works with 16 business partners to serve this customer segment, and holds a substantial market share for Sri Lankan remittances from Kuwait. The Bank has also stationed two Business Promotions Officers in Kuwait to assist Sri Lankans living and working there with their banking needs.
The Banks first Business Promotion Officer (BPO) too was placed in Kuwait in late 2003 to serve the large Sri Lankan work force.Kuwait also has the highest number of Sri Lankans, totaling over 160, working at exchange house counters.
Commercial Bank is one of the most active players in Sri Lanka in the field of remittances, offering customers a range of options including e-Exchange  the Banks own sophisticated real-time on-line money transfer service, as well as the MoneyGram, Ria and Express Money remittance services. The Bank also launched its Remittance Card in Kuwait in 2016. One of the Banks key strengths is its island-wide network of 261 branches, many of which remain open on public, bank and mercantile holidays, and its network of 756 ATMs.
Recipients of remittances sent to the Bank enjoy many benefits such as over 60 holiday banking centres and super market counters, a dedicated customer support call centre for remittances and SMS alerts facilities once the remittance is received and is ready to be paid out.

Con-artists succeed only by your need to feed on greed!
Welcome to the shadowy world of confidence artistes, or con-men. A con-man, or woman, is a person who deliberately deceives another usually for personal financial gain. Despite what you may think, a con man, or woman isn't always a shady-looking character.
A con-artist is an expert at looking however he/she needs to look. Make no mistake about it, con artistes and con-men are among the most cultured, well-mannered and courteous people on Planet Earth.
You find them everywhere, the smooth-talking sophisticated types, with an aristocratic demeanour who impress you with their charisma. Con-men are suave and slick characters and tend to be excellent conversationalists while appearing genuinely charming.
Had they taken to the thespian profession they would have won accolades and Oscars by the bushel for their acting performances. They possess the flawless ability to charm and flatter people and also make them noticeably comfortable. This is obviously an effective ploy for getting what they want from people.
The shyster employs a light and subtle touch. His modus operandi does not involve violence or blackmail to get his prey to part with his money. No. That would be a contravention of the law. That is why his technique is at variance with all other forms of crime.
The confidence trickster is occasionally graded with criminals such as thieves, pickpockets, and larcenists. But that is usually a misnomer as he is not a thief in the legal sense because he does not actually steal. In many cases the gullible victim virtually thrusts a wad of money into his grubby hands. It is a personal accomplishment to him that he does not really have to steal in a technical sense.
So you see, many con-men are not crooks in the regular discernment of the word. A con-man flourishes in his occupation primarily because of the supportive dishonesty and greed of his victim. He first wins the confidence of his quarry. He is then able to inspire in him a firm belief in his own honesty. The next step is to excite the avarice of his target holding out the exciting prospect of easy profit. All the same they could rightly be categorised as charlatans and 'dirty rotten scoundrels.'
Con-artists make money through deception. They lie, cheat and fool people into thinking they have happened onto a great deal or some easy money. Remember the old adage that you never get something for nothing.
There's another axiom which goes: "You can't cheat an honest man." Most cons rely on the victim's own greed. Con-artists know that people often throw caution to the wind when they start seeing currency signs flickering before their eyes. Deals that sound too good to be true usually are. Relatively few master con-men are ever brought to trial unless they keep pushing their luck too far. Yet of those who are tried, few are convicted. And of those who are convicted, even fewer ever serve out their full sentences. This accounts for the fact that it has been found very difficult to prosecute confidence men successfully. For once a victim is fleeced he often proves to be a most reluctant and untruthful witness against the men who have taken his money.
These scams will often come in the form of a suave dynamic salesman phoning you or through glitzy promotional material in the post or on email. Basically when it comes to all sorts of investing is that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. For example, 'Ponzi schemes' are some of the oldest scams of them all. These swindles were named after Charles Ponzi who first ran an investment scam in the 1920s where investors were persuaded to buy postal reply coupons. The scheme collapsed after he was found using new investor money to pay older investors. This is something to watch out for in cold-called investments that offer regular income or capital gains.
In Sri Lanka the Golden Key Credit Card Company run by Lalith Kotelawala collapsed like a pack of cards. Golden Key and the enterprises run by Sakvithi Ranasinghe operated such schemes on a large scale. They were two of the biggest scams to rock the country in recent years.
In recent history there have been a number of con-men who have really stood out for the wealth they amassed, their impudence and the ease with which they tricked trusting people. The majority of successful con-men undoubtedly have great style. Some call it the genius of social engineering for fleecing people for everything they have.
Our little isle too earned the dubious reputation of producing two such hustlers regarded as among the most audacious con-men in international history. No doubt, they were suave and slick and classy operators. Michael Marion Emil Anacletus Pierre Savundranayagam, better known as Emil Savundra and also styling himself Doctor Savundra (1923 -1976), was a Ceylonese international swindler and confidence trickster active in Belgium, Ghana and England. He was behind the collapse and scandal of the Fire, Auto and Marine Insurance Company in the United Kingdom. He was at least twice imprisoned for his crimes of fraud.
Then there was Charles Percival de Silva (1947-73) originally from Ceylon, with a sound education and a wealthy grandfather. He came to England in 1947. A courteous, intelligent man, he spent a quarter of a century either defrauding wealthy, gullible society people, or spending time in jail for his scams, which he referred to lightly as "one of my little games."
Operating by and large out of London's trendy West End, De Silva became identified and respected by members of London's wealthy establishment whom he would eventually swindle out of about 3 million, a staggering sum at the time. In 1951, he spent his first term in jail, sentenced for attempting to swindle Selfridge's store out of more than 2,000 in nylons, a then scarce commodity.
Released from jail, De Silva who was impressed by social connections cadged an invitation to a party held by the prestigious philanthropist Lady Dorothy Macmillan. He gave her a large cheque for one of her favourite charities, impressing the wealthy 'mug' sufficiently to get her to invest large amounts in fraudulent schemes soon after.
But what actually won him the highest questionable recognition was his duping an American multi-millionaire who had a penchant for young girls. De Silva pulled what was clearly the most incredible and hilarious scam in history which elevated him to the title of the 'Prince of Knaves' - the highest tribute the 'con' fraternity could confer on a master at the game.
Arranging a team of hand-picked prostitutes, all dressed as schoolgirls, De Silva threw a party for the American, convincing him that the young ladies had been provided by the Mother Superior of a Catholic convent school. The affluent American wrote a cheque for 25,000 to be paid to the non-existent Mother Superior. Without a doubt, it was the biggest 'pros and cons' swindle in history!

Confidence calls for strength
With the noise of the no confidence motion against the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe the issue of the powers of the president came under debate again. Comrade Jayampathi of course believes that he has put the final nails on the coffin of this issue. Strangely, things happened recently that made the yahapalana democratic movement to demand that presidency, even with the 19th Amendment, is an unwanted burden hence it should be removed with a separate amendment for that purpose. However those who want to continue with presidential system, for its shape of Raja perhaps, come forward to defend the constitution now in function.
They argue that dictatorial aspect of the constitution has been moderated to make it a powerful democratic constitution. They condemn that the near hysterical response to the local election results, by parliamentarians and the media alike, demonstrated an unfortunate lack of understanding of the powers of the President.
Executive powers
According to them the office of President today, not what was established by President Jayewardene in 1978; nor are the powers of that office the same or even similar. The 19th Amendment [19A] stripped the Presidency of nearly all the executive powers which President Jayewardene invested himself with. The President today is, in many respects, a constitutional Head of State who is required to act on the advice of the Prime Minister, similar to the Presidency under the 1972 Constitution.
However in the present constitution, leader of political party antagonistic to that of the Prime Minister can assume the post of president. This arrangement is very much different from the functions of a ceremonial Head of State, be it a Queen or President. In the United Kingdom, its exercise is regulated by convention. But we are used to entirely different tradition for several decades.
In Lanka, Article 43 of the Constitution empowers the President to appoint as Prime Minister the Member of Parliament who in his opinion is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament. No petition with signatures, or even a vote of confidence in Parliament, is required. This absolute power come from 1972 Constitution where president is appointed by the political head. It means that if the president in his opinion concludes that the sitting Prime Minister has lost the confidence of the parliament, president could attempt to throw the Prime Minister out! In any event, if the President were to dismiss the Prime Minister, he may do so only if he is of the opinion that the Prime Minister most likely does not command the confidence of Parliament, and that some other Member of Parliament does. In such event, that other person should immediately be appointed Prime Minister!
1972 Constitution
On the other hand 1978 Constitution originally provided that a Minister or a Deputy Minister may be removed from office by a writing under the hand of the President. The 19A deleted that provision. In its place was substituted a provision which states that a Minister or Deputy Minister may be removed from office under the hand of the President on the advice of the Prime Minister. Therefore, the process of removing a Minister or Deputy Minister now has to be initiated by the Prime Minister, and in making a removal order the President is required to act on the Prime Ministers advice. Thereby, the position under the 1972 Constitution has been restored. Also, the 1978 Constitution originally empowered the President to exercise his executive power to dissolve Parliament at any time after the first year following a general election. The 19A removed that power.
The President may now dissolve Parliament only in the last six months of its five-year term. If he wishes to do so earlier, he needs to obtain the consent of Parliament expressed through a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of its members voting in favour.
The President, of course, has residuary executive powers which every Head of State possesses. He is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Head of the Executive. He may declare war and peace. Now that president is a live political leader not just an apolitical figure like Gopallawa these powers are serious. He may appoint and accredit an ambassador, but only if the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has secured the agreement of the receiving state. The recent problem involving the Defence Attach in London, when the President reportedly overruled the Foreign Ministers instructions that the officer concerned should return home immediately, demonstrated the reality of presidential powers.
In addition the President has the power to pardon any convicted offender, or substitute a less severe form of punishment. Finally, the President of Sri Lanka is constitutionally vested with a unique power, without precedent in the constitution of any other country; that is, to appoint Presidents Counsel. In exercising all these powers, a political head will be governed by his political will.
Provincial administration
The 19th Amendment left intact certain powers which the 13th Amendment had vested in the President. These relate to provincial administration. The President appoints a Governor for each province. Where there is a failure of its administrative machinery, the President may, upon being so informed by the Governor, assume to himself the powers of the Governor for a period of 14 days; the powers of the Provincial Council passes to Parliament which may, in turn, confer such powers on the President who may, in turn, delegate such powers to any other authority.
The 19A, left intact the provision in the Constitution which indirectly make the Public Security Ordinance of 1947 to be a law enacted by Parliament. Consequently, it is the President who, under that Ordinance, decides whether to declare a state of public emergency, and it is the President who makes emergency regulations; however proclamation declaring the existence of a state of public emergency lapses in 14 days; unless Parliament by a resolution approves it.
Therefore, unless the President had acted with the concurrence of the Prime Minister, his proclamation will necessarily be short-lived.
The argument that presidency established by the 1978 Constitution no longer exists and the 19A has effectively abolished it is a dangerous statement. It is true that the President, of his own volition, cannot choose the Ministers.
He cannot remove any Minister from office except on the advice of the Prime Minister. He cannot dissolve Parliament at a time of his choosing. Acting alone, he cannot appoint Judges, Senior Officials or the independent Commissions. But as pointed above the residue is unacceptable. We must implement the promise to remove executive presidency.

Cows with character
A quarter of a century ago, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas wrote a gripping account of spying on her dogs as they roamed free in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her book The Hidden Life of Dogs, which described the packs surprising doings when humans werent in the picture, became a durable bestseller. Its author was not shy about what she felt she had accomplished. I have always wanted to enter into the consciousness of a nonhuman creature, she wrote.
Theres been no abatement since then of popular books that purport to expose the secret or hidden lives of animals. Thomas went on to write about cats and deer, but there are owls, octopuses, elephants, toads, bees, flies and even lobsters among recent offerings.
While the newer books tend to hang their cases on a growing body of scientific findings in animal behaviour, evolutionary biology and neuroscience, they all touch on age-old questions about consciousness and subjective experience. And because the invitation to journey into an animals mind requires at least a minor leap of faith, most writers will attempt to frame, or pre-empt, any concerns about anthropomorphism. Thomas brushed those off on evolutionary grounds, arguing that it is unscientific to draw too bold a line between our own mental experience and that of other animals, especially mammals, because our neural and hormonal networks evolved along similar pathways. That out of the way, she pronounced one dog pair husband and wife.
Scientific scaffolding
Rosamund Youngs The Secret Life of Cows, originally published in 2003, has overtones of Thomass classic, relying more on its authors intimacy with her subject than on scientific scaffolding. I have told the stories exactly as they happened but of course the interpretation of the actions of the characters is mine, Young writes in her introduction, challenging readers to take it or leave it.
Youngs characters are her cows, which she raises for meat on an organic farm in the Cotswolds. These Ayrshires and Herefords have long enjoyed privileges that modern factory farming would deny them. They have ample pasture, and express distinct preferences as to where to roam, what to eat, and whose company to keep. They seek out certain plants, especially willow, to eat when theyre feeling ill; they are siblings, cousins, friends or sworn enemies, Young writes. They are named after poets, royals, clergy and emperors. They are, above all, individuals who make choices all day long.
Young believes that the appearance of behavioural uniformity among cows, pigs, even chickens, is an upshot of factory farming. Animals and people can seem to lose their identities if forced to live in unnatural, crowded, featureless or boring conditions, she writes. On her farm mothers remain with their calves, sometimes enlisting female relatives as babysitters. (One cow named Charlotte did not take naturally to motherhood, Young writes, and her calf, Calpurnia, was not permitted to suckle milk from her debutante-type mother who announced straight away that the nanny could bring up the brat.)
Feigned ignorance
It doesnt really matter that Youngs depictions of her cows as expressing such complex cognitive states as bafflement, gratitude, or feigned ignorance when shes scolding them fall outside the scope of the empirically demonstrable. Through decades of close observation, Young has uncovered many fascinating and unknown behaviours. As she acknowledges, however, these can be hard to separate cleanly from her imagination, or ours.
The German forester Peter Wohlleben shares Youngs conviction that animal behaviour is often rooted in individual character and choice. In The Inner Life of Animals, a follow-up to his book on trees, Wohllebens subjects are woodland creatures: red deer, squirrels, boar, mice and ravens, along with domestic animals he has raised. He has seen courageous fawns, depressed does, conniving roosters. Unlike Young, he is anxious to show that his observations are objectively valid. To give them heft, he highlights findings from the past decade or so, many of them by German and Austrian researchers.
Writing about bees, Wohlleben recalls his experience as a keeper to attest that theres a lot more going on inside their little heads than the conventional wisdom would have it. Bees will attack people who have annoyed them in the past, while allowing trusted ones to approach, he says. He cites research by a Berlin neurobiologist that subverts the old notion that a hive of bees acts as a collective super-organism. In fact, individual bees are capable of a limited form of decision-making and planning, Wohlleben writes, and they are self-aware.
Wohlleben is especially sensitive to how certain species perceive hunger and cold, and to their pain and trauma. He reports encountering on his winter walks the nests of wood mice that have been plundered by martens, which steal the rodents food and often help themselves to a mouse or two in the process. What must that have been like for the other mice he wonders. Were they simply afraid of the marten, or did they also realize that its activities caused one of their own to suffer He turns to a Canadian study showing that, as he suspected, mice become highly stressed when suffering is inflicted on another member of their group.
Cold and inadequate
It requires a certain cognitive dissonance to cite scientific paper after paper in support of your own conclusions, then to malign scientists. According to Wohlleben, scientists write in dry, academic language that rarely leads to a better understanding of the subject; they demand proof of animal feelings that cannot reasonably exist. Even the term mating to describe the sex life of animals seems cold and inadequate to him.
It is not a fair characterization. Ever since Charles Darwin argued for seeing mental experience across a continuum in his book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), biologists have had to navigate between reading too much into an animals actions and ascribing everything to conditioning or instinct.
The pendulum has swung many times between generosity and parsimony, but the evidence now supports an ever-richer range of emotional experience, even as some canards get debunked (dogs dont look at you pathetically because theyre feeling guilty; its because youre yelling at them).

England three down - need another 237 runs to save Test
AUCKLAND March25-New Zealand snapped up three wickets Sunday, including that of Joe Root with the last ball of the day, to pin down an England side battling to salvage a draw from the first Test.
At stumps England were 132 for three, still needing another 237 runs on the final day to save the Test in Auckland. Danger man Root was on 51, his 38th half-century in Tests, when he was smacked on the right index finger by a flyer from Trent Boult in the last over. After medical treatment he shaped up to face the last ball of the day and was caught behind by wicketkeeper BJ Watling. New Zealand had declared their first innings on 427 for eight, with Henry Nicholls unbeaten on 145 to show the pitch held no demons. But England were in immediate trouble as they faced a target of 369 to avoid an innings defeat.
The timing of the declaration gave the hosts 50 minutes to bowl at England before dinner in the day-night Test and then have another crack in the twilight-to-dark period.
The innings was only into its third over when Trent Boult had Alastair Cook caught down the leg side by Watling for two.
But the devastating swing bowling from Boult and Tim Southee that saw England crumble for 58 in the first innings lost its zing quickly in the second. Instead, it was Neil Wagner with his barrage of bouncers in the final session who struck next.
Mark Stoneman and Root, having ridden their luck as they played and missed through the early overs, found the footwork that had deserted them in the first innings and put on 88 for the second wicket. But Wagner, not required to bowl in the first innings when Boult and Tim Southee did all the damage, broke the partnership with a new style of delivery. Two short balls to Stoneman were pulled for a four and a six to get him to 55. Then Wagner changed his angle, put more into the next delivery so it rose higher and saw the ball top-edged to Boult at fine leg. That left England on 94 for two, with Root and Dawid Malan adding 38 before Root's dismissal.
Despite England's first innings collapse, Nicholls rarely seemed under pressure when he posted his 145, his second Test century, before the declaration. - AFP

EU, six countries exempted from US metals tariffs
A senior US official has said that the European Union (EU) and six other countries will be exempt from steel and aluminium tariffs announced by President Trump, at least temporarily.
Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told a Senate panel that Trump had decided to "pause" the import duties while further discussions took place.
The tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium are due to come into effect on Friday.
The EU had argued it should be exempt.
Aside from the EU Lighthizer said Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea would be exempted.
"The idea that the president has is that, based on a certain set of criteria, that some countries should get out," he told the Senate committee hearing.
"There are countries with whom we're negotiating and the question becomes the obvious one that you think, as a matter of business, how does this work
"So what he has decided to do is to pause the imposition of the tariffs with respect to those countries."
Earlier this month, the EU's trade commissioner said the bloc would "stand up to the bullies" over protectionism.
Cecilia Malmstrm said protectionism was being "used as a weapon to threaten and intimidate us". In announcing exemptions for the European Union, Argentina, Australia, South Korea and Brazil, the Trump administration has effectively narrowed the countries that it is targeting with its protectionist trade policies. It also blunts the potential fallout to the US economy from the implementation of these trade barriers. US imports of steel last year totalled $33bn.
But if the countries granted exemptions are removed from that total - including Canada and Mexico, whose exemptions had already been announced - then less than a third of US steel imports would be subject to tariffs.
This significantly lowers the potential economic impact of the tariffs - as well as the potential help it might provide to domestic steel industry here in the United States.
And it suggests that in steel tariffs, as with many policy actions the White House has taken, the reality of what is being done falls slightly short of the rhetoric.
Gareth Stace, a director with the trade association UK Steel, said the temporary exemption from tariffs would be "greeted with an enormous sigh of relief" by the UK's steel sector.
"It now provides us with the breathing room to find a more permanent solution.

Federer to lose No. 1 ranking after shock loss to Kokkinakis
MIAMI, Sunday - Roger Federer's latest reign atop the world rankings will end after the Swiss great's shock loss to Australian qualifier Thanasi Kokkinakis in the second round of the Miami Masters on Saturday.
Kokkinakis, ranked 175th in the world, needed a wild card just to get into qualifying. But he showed nerves of steel in a 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) triumph over 20-time Grand Slam champion Federer.
I was calmer than I thought, Kokkinakis said of the third-set tiebreaker. Inside I was pretty happy, I was excited, but I kept pretty calm.
Federer, who won his 20th Grand Slam crown at the Australian Open, regained the number one spot in February after winning the ATP title in Rotterdam but needed to reach the quarter-finals to remain at the summit.
Instead he'll be replaced by Spain's Rafael Nadal when the rankings are released at the end of the tournament.
I deserve it after this match. That's how I feel. Just so bad, said Federer, adding that he could never get to any level that I was happy with today.
Sometimes you have these matches, he said. Sometimes you find a way through. I just couldn't get it done today.
The 36-year-old wasted no time in announcing he'll skip the clay-court season, including the French Open, just as he did last year after winning titles in Indian Wells and Miami.
The 21-year-old Kokkinakis, who has already battled injuries in his young career, became the lowest-ranked player to beat a world number one since Spain's Francisco Clavet was 178th when he upset top-ranked Lleyton Hewitt in the second round at Miami in 2003. Federer appeared firmly in control when he breezed through the first set without facing a break point, dropping just six points on his own serve. His lone break for a 3-1 lead was all he needed to pocket the set.
But after saving break points in the opening game of the second, Kokkinakis seized upon a lackluster service game from Federer to break for a 3-1 lead, holding firm on his own serve to force the decider.
I feel like it already started beginning of the second set when I had break points first game, and he almost wanted to give me that game, and I couldn't take it, Federer said. From that moment on, I played maybe a bad 10 minutes, which cost me the second set, maybe the match.
Kokkinakis admitted he didn't really put any pressure on Federer in the opening set.
In the second set I kind of used a couple of loose errors -- I started getting in the rallies more and dictating a bit with my forehand.
Federer was again impenetrable on his serve in the third, but he was unable to capitalize on his only two break points, both in a marathon sixth game, as they went on serve to the tiebreaker. Two errors from Federer gave Kokkinakis a 4-3 lead. A stinging forehand winner put the young Aussie up 6-4, and he closed it out when Federer netted a backhand service return.
When I feel like I'm playing on my terms I don't think there's too many people that can go with me Kokkinakis said. I just needed to play my game and play aggressive tennis.

Fellowship tried and tested
Speech delivered by Special Assignment Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok
The subject for discussion today Sri Lanka and Thailand: a timeless Partnership is very appropriate because it encompasses the past, present and future of our two countries which have many links, prominent among them being our relationships based on a common Theravada Buddhist heritage. This is clearly seen in the establishment of the Siyam Nikaya in Sri Lanka and the Lanka Nikaya in Thailand.
Buddhist links between Sukhothai and Anuradhapura in the early period, between Ayutthaya and Kandy in the middle period and between Bangkok and towns in South Ceylon in the modern period have now been carried over to the present. Our two countries have most cordial relations at state, religious, economic and people to people levels. Indeed as two of the leading Theravada countries in the world, we have exemplary relations between us and have brought a new Buddhist perspective to international relations in the modern world.
In this presentation, I will not deal with relations in the medieval period except to say that new research is highlighting the strength of our relations, visible particularly in common forms of Buddhist art and architecture, in two centres of an ancient Buddhist civilization namely Sukhothai and Anuradhapura. The Anuradhapura period in Sri Lanka, in particular, is now found to be much more complex in both Sangha and lay organisations than was described before by scholars. For instance, the orthodox Mahavihara was challenged by other Theravada sects strongly influenced by Mahayana doctrines.
Recent excavations have highlighted such diversity including the discovery in Anuradhapura of several gold plates in which the Prajna Paramita, the classic Mahayana text has been inscribed. This leads to new thinking regarding ancient Buddhist centres like Anuradhapura and Sukhothai, which we now know were linked by sea routes as well as overland silk routes'. They were much more sophisticated and heterodox than believed earlier. The link between Sri Lanka and Sukhothai and later Cheng Mai temple architecture has been well established. Sinhala Buddhist Monks have come overland via Burma and by sea to these famous Buddhist sites.
I now turn to a vital development in Thai-Sri Lanka relations in the 17th and 18th centuries. This was a time when the western powers had consolidated their presence in Asia. In Sri Lanka, the Portuguese entered the southern littoral in 1505. They were followed by the Dutch who expelled the Portuguese in 1658 and established their power in the coastal areas. However, during these periods the Central Highlands with Kandy as its capital, remained independent.
Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha
A key element of this independence was the king's possession of the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha which was housed in the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy and venerated by Buddhists all over the world. Among such Buddhist worshippers were His Majesty King Chulalongkorn who visited Sri Lanka and travelled to Kandy in 1897.
By the time the Portuguese and the Dutch established themselves in the coastline, the Sinhala Sangha had declined to a state when they abandoned many of the characteristic features of Buddhist monkhood Monks became landowners and ritual specialists and were called Ganninanses or Ganavolin, in contrast to Swamin wahanse or Unnanse which were the Sinhala folk appellations for Buddhist monks. Many of the Ganninanses, who were custodians of temple properties big and small, were not celibates. They sheltered concubines and their progeny in the Temple premises, or in adjoining lands. Hence the Vasagamas or Kinship identifies such progeny in the Temple premises, or in adjoining lands. Hence the Vasagamas or Kinship identities of such progeny and their successor kin, included Vihara Walawve and Viharagedara, denoting an acknowledgement of consanguinity.
They dressed differently from the prescribed robes of monks and practised many rituals which were prohibited by the Vinaya. Even their sermons and chanting of pirith were modified to suit the needs of village worshippers by emphasizing demons and hobgoblins. The most disturbing aspect, however, was that the Upasampada or higher ordination had died out and even the Mahanayakes were technically novices or samaneras.
The tradition of Pali scholarship had also died out and the writings of many senior ganninanses, dealt with esoteric subjects such as astrology, healing rituals and necromancy. Resistance to this parlous state came not from centres such as Malwatta and Asgiriya but from the periphery populated by village monks. The leader of this resistance was a young samanera from Welivita, which was a remote village in Tumpane, which lay in the outer boundary of the Kandyan kingdom. The novice mink was known as Welivita Saranankara. He had entered the order at age sixteen and was affiliated to the nearby Suriyagoda Temple which had an important link with Malwatta.
Saranankara discovered early that both the Dhamma and Vinaya could not be understood without a knowledge of Pali language which had by now virtually disappeared in the country another indication of the collapse of the monkhood. One of the few people who had a rudimentary knowledge of Pali was Leuke Dissawa who had been exiled by the King to Mahakehelwala in the Alagalla hills. Having learnt what little he could from Leuke, Saranankara himself furthered his studies by himself and sought out Watabuluwe Thera who was the only survivor of an earlier attempt to bring the higher ordination from Arakan  a province of Burma, during the reign of Vimaladharmasuriya the second (1687-1707). Vimaladharmasuriya's attempt at reintroducing Upasampada failed and the Sangha reverted to its ganinnanse practices. However, the young monk objected to the corruption of the Sangha and set up his Silvat Samagama of like-minded reformist monks who were characterized by their abstemious life and commitment to learning and explicating of religious texts. This brought him to the notice of the reigning monarch Narendrasingha, (1707-1739).
Kandyan literature
Narendrasingha's demise in 1739 marked a fracture in Kandyan kingship since it led to the induction of Nayakkars of Madurai as rulers of the Sinhalese. The royal line died out and, in terms of matrilineal succession, a Vaduga or Malabar Prince ascended the throne as Vijaya Rajasingha (1739-1747). Thus begins what is called the Nayakkar period of Sinhala Kingship. It is also referred to, in contempt, in Kandyan literature as the rule of the Vadugayas'. Their entry introduced a new complexity to the Kandyan polity since the traditions of the Kandyans, represented by the ambitious aristocracy, were challenged by the influence of new Malabar leaders who had the ear of the king and were also reluctant to abandon many of their customs based on Hindu religious beliefs.
Vijaya Rajasingha as a young man had been trained, at the request of Narendrasingha, by Saranankara since the priest was acknowledged as a leading Buddhist figure of this time. Indeed, according to the poem entitled Mandarampura Puvata, it was Saranankara who had managed to place his student Prince on the throne overriding the claims of a native son, Unambuwe Bandara, the son of Narendrasingha by a Sinhalese concubine.
Leveraging his position as the King's Rajaguru, Saranankara sought to limit the expansion of Catholicism and to negotiate with the Dutch, who had by now become a strong naval presence in Asia, to send emissaries to Ayutthaya in order to re-establish Upasampada in Kandy. This was a continuation of his project to cleanse the Sinhala Sangha and revive Buddhism to its early status. The Dutch too, seeing a change of heart in Kandy with the accession of the new King, responded with alacrity and a mission was sent via Batavia, their headquarters in the Asian theatre.
The early attempts at reaching Ayutthaya failed because of shipwreck and internal dissension but eventually, they succeeded in establishing strong bonds with the Siamese Court of King Boromkot even though by his time Vijaya Rajasingha was dead.
Sri Vijaya Rajasingha was succeeded by Kirti Sri Rajasinghe (1747-1782) whose reign marks an efflorescence of Buddhism and Sangha organisation, Sinhala and Pali literature and the building of many temples in the country.
The art and architecture of his period depict the best of Kandyan Buddhist culture, which was dynamic enough to assimilate South Indian and Siamese influences. Yet, the end of Kirti Sri's reign is marked by protests and revolts by Kandyan priests and a section of the aristocracy.
It even led to a rift with the Sangharaja who was accused of siding with the king's opponents on behalf of a Thai prince, Krumpti Pippet who was accused of siding with the king's opponents on behalf of a Thai prince, Krumpti Pippet who was brought to Ceylon in the guise of a monk, with the intention of making him king. But what is significant is that the institutional changes remained. In 1753 Sinhala monks had been granted Upasampada in Kandy.
Malwatte and Asgiriya continued this ritual by establishing their own individual simas which persist up to present times. These two institutions also established Sangha hierarchies with Mahanayakes and Karaka Sabhas or Management Committees made up of the senior most monks as its members. This Siamese connection was emphasized by the Siyam Nikaya. It also paved the way for later Buddhist monks, particularly of the South, to look on the Siamese King as a patron of Sinhala Buddhists.
The rejuvenated Siyam Nikaya which controlled by far the largest number of monasteries in the country led to a revival of Buddhism even in the coastline which showed a greater degree of foreign influence. Many of the castes which were predominant in the southern coastline, which had been denied entry to the Siyam Nikaya, established their own fraternities after obtaining Upasampada from Burmese monks and were therefore known as the Amarapura and Ramanna Nikayas.
Christian Missionaries
These monks together with Siyam Nikaya monks of the South not only established a strong presence but began to challenge the Christian Missionaries who were becoming more influential through colonial patronage. In this revival of Buddhism the nineteenth century the monks looked to the royalty of Burma and Siam as they promulgated the belief in a Buddhist Raja or the Buddhist King (Dharmaraja). Their ideal was King Mongkut or Rama IV of Siam who was giving leadership to a Buddhist revival in Thailand which challenged Christian Missionaries.
Rama IV established the Dhammayuthika Nikaya which emphasized adherence to the Pali based Tripitaka and a more austere lifestyle. He encouraged Pali studies, being proficient himself in the use of Pali. As a Buddhist reformer, King Mongkut had links with Ceylonese monks. He corresponded with them and financed the purchase of a Printing Press which was badly needed to counter the publications that were coming out in large quantities from the Catholic and evangelical Printing Presses. Mongkut emphasized the need for employing modern technology.
The Sinhala Buddhists, after the loss of their King in 1815, looked on the rulers of the two remaining Theravada Buddhist States for help and protection. King Thebaw (1878-1885) of Burma had helped in the building of a Rest House for Buddhists Buddhagaya. However the British annexed Burma in 1885 and exiled Thebaw and his entourage to Ratnagiri in India.
Turning to modern times it is clear that there are many opportunities to build on our historic good relations. In economic terms, we belong to two different regional groupings  ASEAN and SAARC. However, there has been greater contact between the economies of our countries in the areas of tourism, gems and jewellery, agriculture, fisheries and industry. Sri Lanka is a hub in South Asia and has Free Trade Agreements with India and Pakistan while negotiations for an FTA with Bangladesh are currently in place. Sri Lanka has GSP+status with the EU and US and can readily access the large Indian market. There is good air connectivity between Colombo and Bangkok and people to people exchanges are increasing.
In conclusion, I would like to make a proposal. The World Federation of Buddhists which was led by a Sri Lanka Buddhist, Dr. Malalasekera has functioned for over fifty years has been jointly promoted by Thailand and Sri Lanka. The time has come for our two countries to sponsor jointly a political and economic organisation of Theravada Buddhist countries in the world.
In addition to our two countries, there are Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam which share a Buddhist tradition of the Little Vehicle or Theravada. Whatever ideological differences these countries may have had in the past today they can fashion a new spirit of cooperation on the basis of a tolerant philosophy which is part of the Buddhist heritage. The Chulalongkorn University which commemorates a great Buddhist King who encouraged the spread of Buddhism in the region can play an important role in promoting such an organisation which is badly needed in the world today.

Five previous ball-tampering incidents
CAPE TOWN, Saturday: Australian batsman Cameron Bancroft and captain Steve Smith admitted to ball-tampering against South Africa during the third Test on Saturday, with the issue of players cheating by changing the condition of the ball rearing its ugly head again.
Here, AFP Sport look at five previous ball-tampering scandals in Test cricket:
DU PLESSIS - AUSTRALIA V SOUTH AFRICA, 2016
Australia's current opponents South Africa have had players found guilty of similar incidents three times in the last five years, including captain Faf du Plessis. The batsman was caught on camera sucking on a sweet during the second Test in Hobart, before using his saliva to shine the ball. Despite no accusations from Australia, the ICC found Du Plessis guilty and fined him 100 percent of his match fee. He avoided a ban and responded with a hundred in the following match.
DU PLESSIS - PAKISTAN V SOUTH AFRICA, 2013
Du Plessis was also charged for using a foreign object to change the condition of the ball in a 2013 clash against Pakistan in Dubai. He appeared to rub the ball against the zip on his trouser pocket, and was fined 50 percent of his match fee. South Africa were again caught in hot water a year later when bowler Vernon Philander was found guilty of scratching the ball with his fingers and thumb.
PAKISTAN - ENGLAND V PAKISTAN, 2006
Maybe the most infamous ball-tampering controversy in recent memory ended with Pakistan forfeiting their Test against England at The Oval 12 years ago. Umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove gave England five penalty runs after ruling that Pakistan had tampered with the ball, leaving the tourists incensed. Inzamam ul-Haq's side refused to take the field after the tea break in protest, and the umpires awarded the match to England, the first forfeiture in Test history. Pakistan were later cleared of ball-tampering by the ICC, with the governing body also controversially changing the result of the match to a draw.
TENDULKAR - SOUTH AFRICA V INDIA, 2001
Indian great Sachin Tendulkar was handed a one-match ban by match referee Mike Denness after a game against South Africa in Port Elizabeth. Television footage appeared to show Tendulkar scuffing the seam of the ball, but he was actually only removing a piece of grass. There was serious backlash from Indian fans against Denness, with allegations of racism. The ICC eventually cleared Tendulkar of any wrongdoing, but the following third Test had its Test status revoked as the Indian cricket board refused to accept Denness as the match referee.
ATHERTON - ENGLAND V SOUTH AFRICA, 1994
Then-England captain Mike Atherton was accused of ball-tampering for taking a substance from his pocket and rubbing it on the ball. He denied the allegations, saying he used some dirt from his pocket to dry his hands.
He was not charged with ball-tampering and instead fined 2,000 for failing to disclose the dirt to the match referee. Despite calls for the opening batsman to resign, Atherton stayed on as England skipper full-time until 1998.

## Title: France plans on-the-spot fines for sexual harassment in public

France plans on-the-spot fines for sexual harassment in public
France is to introduce on-the-spot fines for sexual harassment in public places and lengthen the time-limit for filing rape complaints as part of new legislation against sexual violence.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has said the aim is to ensure women are not afraid to be outside.
The legislation, which will be presented at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday and go to parliament in the coming months, was prepared before the sexual harassment allegations against the Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein and the #MeToo movement, but it has gained prominence since.
The law will also set a new legal age of consent  15  at which a minor is considered able to agree to a sexual relationship with an adult aged over 18. This move follows outrage over a case in which a rape charge was dropped when a court decided an 11-year-old girl had consented to sex with a man more than twice her age.
The crackdown on sexual harassment would mean fines for degrading or humiliating comments or hostile and offensive sexual or sexist behaviour towards a person in a public place. The minister for gender equality, Marlne Schiappa, has explained this could include situations such as men aggressively asking a woman for her phone number dozens of times when she is clear she is not interested, as well as sexual intimidation and harassment on public transport.
The legislation, which would be enforced by police officers issuing on-the-spot fines, is backed by 90 percent of the French public, according to an Ifop poll published on Wednesday.
A 2016 study by a national association of transport users in France found that 83% of women using public transport said they had been subjected to catcalling or intimidating comments about their appearance.
Schiappa said this week that the fines would range from 90 to 750. They could be far higher for repeat offenders or in the case of aggravating circumstances. The idea is that it is high enough to be a deterrent but also that we could be sure the harasser can pay it immediately, so that the law can be efficient, she said.
Questioned over whether punishing harassment in public places was difficult to enforce, Schiappa told Le Monde this month: Its important that French laws state that it is forbidden to threaten, intimidate or follow women in the street. She said it was part of a cultural fight by the government.
At the UN in New York this month, Schiappa said: We have to say: Young men, you dont have the right, youre not allowed to follow women on the streets, to intimidate them.
The new law will also give people who have been raped as children more time to file a complaint. They will be able to do so until they are 48, an extension of 10 years.
This follows recent cases in which former child victims insisted time limits must be extended. In 2016, Flavie Flament, a French radio producer, accused the photographer David Hamilton of raping her when she was 13, but said the time limit had passed for her to press charges. Hamilton, 83, killed himself in 2016 after Flament went public with her allegations and others also surfaced.
The bill also aims to increase sanctions against cyberstalking and online sexual harassment, particularly when committed by a group of several people targeting one person. The Guardian

Point of view 
The Sri Lankan equity market rout continued yet again this week, with the benchmark ASPI recording its highest weekly loss since late-Nov17 as ongoing political uncertainty was aggravated by growth concerns as the Sri Lankan economy recorded its lowest growth rate in 16-years.
The broad-share price Index lost ~66 points (-1% W-o-W), to record its highest weekly loss since late Nov17 when the market lost 70 points.
Since the rise of communal tensions in early-March, the ASPI has lost 113 index points or 1.7%, paring down the 2.3% gain (between Jan to immediately prior to the communal riots) down to just 0.5%.
Declines on the Index on the back of these domestic political headwinds have been aggravated by rising global geopolitical tensions, resulting in the benchmark index falling below the key 6500 level for the first time in 2-months.
Activity levels on the Colombo Bourse reflected the general sluggishness in sentiment, and daily average turnover levels fell ~42% W-o-W to Rs. 0.73Bn.
Market activity however was dominated by Local Institutional and HNI investors who accounted for ~67% of the weeks market turnover, as retailers opted to remain on the sidelines yet again this week.
Foreign investor appetite for risky domestic assets meanwhile also took a dip this week, as net foreign flows to the CSE fell 89% W-o-W to Rs. 0.1Bn (cf. Rs. 1.0Bn last week).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to move in line with developments on the political and economic front.
FY 2017 GDP falls tomulti-year low of 3.1% 
Sri Lankas GDP growth fell to a 16-year low in 2017, as growth fell to 3.1% Y-o-Y amid a sharper slowdown in H217. H217 GDP growth slowed to 3.2% Y-o-Y compared to H117 when growth was 3.9% Y-o-Y and H216 when growth was 5.1% Y-o-Y.
Slower growth was evident through all three sectors (Agriculture, Industry & Services) with the drought-driven slowdown in the Agriculture sector (-0.8% Y-o-Y) only partially offset by the slower growth in Industry (3.9% Y-o-Y in 2017 cf. 5.8% in 2016) and Services (3.2% Y-o-Y in 2017 cf. 4.7% Y-o-Y in 2016).
Industry sector growth remained low as Y-o-Y improvements in the F&B (+1.5% Y-o-Y cf -0.2% in 2016) and Garment (+5.7% Y-o-Y cf. 1.8% Y-o-Y in 2016) industries failed to offset slower growth in the sectors largest contributing industry, Construction (3.1% Y-o-Y cf. 8.3% Y-o-Y in 2016).
Services sector growth was also lower despite a recovery in the Wholesale and Retail industry ( 3.8% Y-o-Y cf. 2.5% Y-o-Y in 2016) as growth in the other major industries within the sector (Transport (0.9% Y-o-Y cf.5.5% in 2016), Financial Services (9.4% Y-o-Y cf. 12.3% in 2016) and Real Estate (4.7% Y-o-Y cf. 6.3% Y-o-Y) remained sluggish.
National inflation levels in Feb18 meanwhile slowed to a 22-month low of 3.2% Y-o-Y (5.4% in Jan18 and 7.3% in Dec16) supported both by the base effect (a high base prevailed in Feb17) and favourable supply conditions.
NCPI Core inflation, which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy, meanwhile continued its downtrend since Sep17 to fall to 2.0% (cf. 2.1% in Jan18).

Harpic moves South with national sanitation drive
Reinforcing its commitment to bring clean sanitation facilities to all, Harpic together with the Ministry of City Planning and Water supply completed the first set of 100 toilets the two parties have committed to build each year.
The Shri Wijeya Early Child Development Centre, Ransegoda South, Kamburupitiya was among over 30 beneficiaries in the Matara district to receive a new sanitation facility in the first phase of the project, committed to by Harpic and the Ministry of City Planning & Water supply in 2017. The Shri Wijeya Early Child Development Centre, Ransegoda South, Kamburupitiya was established over 40 year ago, but has never had a proper toilet facility until now. An estimated 50 children under the age of 6 years old, receive their first introduction to formal schooling at such institutions across Sri Lanka.
In March 2017, Harpic launched the Harpic Suwa Jana Meheyuma; Mission Wellbeing, in collaboration with the Ministry to elevate the status of hygiene across households in Sri Lanka. The project sought to build 100 toilets annually in selected districts and begun in the Katana area in the Western province.
State Minister of City Planning and Water Supply, Sudarshani Fernandopulle who has been a key proponent in the project since its inception said, We had a very positive response to the project in 2017, and hope that we can continue this initiative to drive good sanitation and hygiene.
Matara District Public Health Inspector, P. Mohotty, addressing the gathering stated that there are many areas across the island where families suffer without proper sanitation facilities.
The Ministry of City Planning and Water Supply has identified the need for nearly 180,000 toilets across Sri Lanka.

Huge gun-control rallies sweep U.S.
US: More than a million Americans flooded the streets of cities nationwide for emotional protests demanding tighter gun control on Saturday, marches spearheaded by teenagers from a Florida high school where 17 people were shot dead last month.
Politicians, either represent the people or get out, Cameron Kasky, a 17-year-old from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, told the crowd at a huge rally in Washington.
Stand for us or beware -- the voters are coming, said Kasky, one of the leaders of a dynamic and passionate student movement which has emerged following the February 14 shooting at his school.
Large crowds also turned out for demonstrations in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, Seattle and other cities -- more than 800 in all according to the organizers of the March For Our Lives. Mayor Bill de Blasio said 175,000 people took part at the New York rally, tweeting: These students WILL change America. But the largest protest was in Washington, where organizers told NBC News the crowd was estimated at more than 800,000 people, the largest gun control rally in the United States since the Million Mom March in 2000.
The main stage for the event in Washington was set up near the US Capitol and lawmakers were the target audience as speakers delivered blistering warnings that the time has come for stricter gun laws.
The people demand a law banning the sale of assault weapons, Kasky said. The people demand we prohibit the sale of high-capacity magazines. The people demand universal background checks. March organizers included a link for people to register to vote on their MarchForOurLives.com website as they seek to transform their nascent movement into a potent political force.
Signs carried by protestors lambasted lawmakers who oppose tougher laws and the National Rifle Association (NRA), the powerful US gun lobby.
These kids are right, said Jeff Turchin, a 68-year-old retired garment manufacturer who came to Washington from New York to attend the rally.
Theyre basically saying the NRA is paying off these Republicans, Turchin said of the party of President Donald Trump, which also controls Congress.
The Washington rally kicked off with Andra Day singing Rise Up and also featured a performances by Jennifer Hudson, whose mother, brother and seven-year-old nephew were shot dead in 2008.
But the most riveting appearances were by the Stoneman Douglas students.
Emma Gonzalez, 17, took the stage wearing a green military-style jacket and ripped jeans and delivered a eulogy for the 14 students and three adults slain by 19-year-old gunman Nikolas Cruz.
Tears rolling down her face, she then stood in silence at the podium for a full four and half minutes as the crowd fidgeted and some cried out Were with you Emma. Since the time that I came out here, it has been six minutes and 20 seconds, Gonzalez finally said -- the exact amount of time Cruz spent spraying bullets inside her school before fleeing.
Fight for your lives before its someone elses job, Gonzalez said. Get out there and vote. Yolanda Renee King, the nine-year-old granddaughter of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. brought many to tears with a surprise appearance.
My grandfather had a dream that his four little children will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character, she told a rapt crowd.
I have a dream that enough is enough, she said, referencing her grandfathers famous 1963 I Have a Dream speech on ending racism. And that this should be a gun-free world -- period.
In New York, former Beatle Paul McCartney showed up at a march and spoke of the December 1980 murder of his bandmate John Lennon.
Every week you hear about a new shooting and nothing is done about it, McCartney told AFP. But I think maybe after this something will be done about it. On the other side of the country in Los Angeles, comedian Amy Schumer delivered a passionate plea in front of hundreds of thousands.
You are killing children, she said, of the gun lobby. And they call people like me Hollywood liberals like theres something in it for us.
Well, whats in it for us is knowing were doing our part to keep our children alive. Demonstrations of solidarity also took place around the world, including across cities in Canada, which unveiled stricter gun laws earlier this week including enhanced background checks.
In Scotland, some relatives of those killed in a school shooting in the town of Dunblane in 1996 attended a protest in Edinburgh.
Thousands meanwhile gathered in Parkland to pay tribute to those slain in the city on Valentines Day.
The protesters met at Parklands Pine Trails Park, the same place where a somber vigil was held in the wake of the February 14 attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
Trump was in Florida as marchers gathered in Washington but the White House issued a statement.
We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today, it said. Keeping our children safe is a top priority of the Presidents.  - AFP

Before its too late
Fu Xuewei, a 25-year-old entrepreneur from Chengdu, China recently shared a beautiful set of wedding photos that are going viral. However, theres an emotional twist to the photographs where no groom seems to be found. In fact, one is not even present as the only people featured in the photoshoot are Fu and her 87-year-old grandfather.
Despite having no plans of getting married anytime soon, Fu Xuewei decided to don the bridal gown for her grandfather. The man fell seriously ill last September, with doctors warning that he could pass away at any time. Fearing he might never get to fulfill the dream of walking his granddaughter down the aisle, Ms. Fu arranged a 3,000 yuan ($475) surprise photoshoot. Keeping her plans a secret, she took her grandfather for a regular hospital check-up, only to reveal that they were going to take pictures later and he agreed.
Fu was raised by her grandparents from the age of ten after her parents divorced and she formed a special bond with her caretakers. She insists on taking care of them in return as they mean a lot to her. The young woman even has a tattoo of her grandfather. I had my grandfathers portrait tattooed on my arm in January because I want my new friends and my children to be able to know what he looks like in the future, she said. Daily Mail

## Title: Justice Murdu Fernando, new Supreme Court Judge

Justice Murdu Fernando, new Supreme Court Judge
Addressing the gathering at the ceremonial sitting to welcome Justice M. N. B. Fernando to the Supreme Court, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya delivered the following speech:
I am privileged and honoured for this opportunity to welcome Presidents Counsel Justice Murdu Nirupa Bidushinie Fernando as a judge of the Apex Court of Sri Lanka. You would bring in with you, the experience gained through 34 years of service in the public sector. You are further-decorating the list of distinguished former members of the Attorney-Generals Department who were appointed as judges of the Supreme Court. With your appointment, a fair balance is maintained in the composition of the final Appellate Court.
Having served an institution that has a history exceeding 130 years, you are now joining another institution that had inherited a longer history; one which exceeds 200 yearsthe Supreme Court.
The Royal Charter of Justice issued in London on April 18, 1801, established a new Supreme Court of Judicature in Ceylon consisting of a Chief Justice and a Puisne Judge. This court was given both criminal and civil Jurisdiction including areas such as testamentary, matrimonial and revenue. Further, the court was empowered to admit persons to act as advocates or proctors, or both. The first Chief Justice Sir Codrington Edmund Carrington, opened its first session on February 12, 1802. Since then, the institution, that was entrusted with the power and authority to dispense justice, embarked on a journey of evolution in our legal system. You are joining this institution when it has completed four decades in its current formThe Supreme Court established under the Second Republican Constitution. This institution which evolved for more than 200 years, is enriched with its traditions, rules and practices.
Justice Murdu Fernando has taken upon the responsibility to protect, preserve and further-enrich its grandeur by joining with the Chief Justice and other Justices who had already embarked on this journey. The importance to protect those rich traditions, practices and rules, was echoed by Chief Justice Sir Stanley Fisher at a ceremonial Sitting on April 16, 1930, in the following words:
Judges come and go, but the continuity of these courts is unbroken. The atmosphere remains and I do think that if it were possible for a judge of 50 years ago to return to these courts, he would at once, feel himself at home and recognise the same atmosphere and the same sense of justice animating and inspiring those who worked in these courts during his own days.
Academic excellence achieved in fields of Trade Law and Practice and International Business Law, including the areas of Marine Insurance, Copy Rights and Related Rights, had further-strengthened your ability to discharge duties assigned to you in the Attorney Generals Department and thereby, serve the Republic effectively and efficiently. The University of Colombo and Kings College of the University of London, in recognition of your academic excellence, awarded you with a diploma and a degree of Master of Law, respectively.
Leadership qualities acquired, possessed and developed since schooldays, provided you the strength to supervise and manage nearly 100 members of the legal profession, serving in the Attorney Generals Department Civil Division.
An educational institution founded more than 14 decades ago by famous Philanthropist Sir Charles Henry De Soyza, Princess of Wales College in Moratuwa nurtured and guided you during your 13-year long student life. You not only excelled in studies, but also successfully contributed to many extra-curricular activities. They included oratorical contests, debating, literary associations and student movements. Leading the school debating team, winning special awards such as Best Debater, Junior Prize for the Most Outstanding Student; holding posts of House Captain, School Prefect and ultimately becoming the Head Prefect, are nothing but features of an excellent school career. It is from such an elevated pedestal that you conquered challenges in professional studies.
Completing both preliminary and final examinations at the Sri Lanka Law College with Honours, while becoming the first in the order of merit at the final examination and being further-decorated with the First Scholarship, the Sir Lalitha Rajapakse Memorial Prize and the A. B. Cooray Memorial Prize, reflects the strong foundation you laid to build this illustrious professional career.
You continued with legal studies and obtained a Bachelor of Law Degree from the University of Colombo. You have brought pride and honour to your alma mater similar to other distinguished past pupils such as the first female Member of Parliament Florance Senanayake and Lady Evlyn De Soyza, a member of the Senate.
Justice Murdu Fernando; State Counsel, Senior State Counsel, Deputy Solicitor General, Additional Solicitor General and Senior Additional Solicitor General are the different capacities in which you served the Attorney Generals Department; an institution which has a history of nearly 13 decades.
During your three-decade long career in the Attorney Generals Department, you attracted respect and honour from all quarters. The firm but pleasing manner with which you discharged supervisory duties, created a welcoming and conducive environment to all junior officers who sought your guidance and support. Duty to the state and responsibilities arising in the discharge of such duties, were the foremost considerations that attracted your attention.
Your diligent and committed service during the last 34 years in public service, has further-illuminated your path. Simplicity and patience are added qualities that you possess, that would help you to sustain and preserve respect and honour accumulated throughout this long journey and continue it with pride.
The advise and guidance you received from former Presidents Counsels late Lena C. Fernando and late Eardly Perera during your apprenticeship and thereafter, would no doubt be of strength to you. Eardly Perera had recognised you as a person who is Brilliant, hardworking and completely engrossed in the Law.
Chief Justice Hema Henry Basnayake Q.C. aptly described the important role an independent and impartial Supreme Court plays in a society, at a ceremonial sitting on July 31, 1964.
To people, the judiciary is the sole protection against tyranny, autocracy and intemperate acts of bureaucracy. To them, it is the forum in which the liberty of the subject could be asserted. It is the place where their wrongs can be remedied, be they committed by a fellow citizen or by the State. To them, it is the only forum in which they can challenge the State on even ground. Every step the government takes to preserve the independence of the courts, every measure introduced to safeguard them, will inevitably redound to its credit. No State is safe with a subservient judiciary. It is the bane of a country, and it enfeebles a nation and makes cowards of its citizens
All achievements from your childhood coupled with your academic excellence, professional experience and skills developed as a Counsel, would bring in a blend, further-enhancing the quality of justice meted out by the Supreme Court. They would no doubt be of immense strength and courage to dispense justice not only to the satisfaction of parties who would come before you, but also society as a whole. The sense of fairness with which you had discharged duties at the Attorney Generals Department, reflects your ability to dispense justice to all parties equally, without fear or favour.
Whilst assuring you our fullest co-operation, I wish you a successful and pleasant tenure of office as a Judge of the Supreme Court!
Thank You.

Lack of funds hinders NCP road development
The improvement and maintenance of North Central Province road network has been badly affected due to lack of funds. It is learnt that ''C" and ''D" group provincial roads to a length of 555.42 km need to be renovated as soon as possible.
Also 254.85 km of gravel roads are not properly maintained and are in a dilapidated condition.
"C" and "D" category roads in the North Central Province coming under the provincial Road Development Authority (PRDA) are 1,439.32 km in length. Only 657.8 km. have been carpeted under an ADB-funded road project and 2012 Deyata Kirula district development programme. About 518.37 km of road needs to be carpeted.
A few years ago, a Rs. 6,000 million Asian Development Bank-funded road development project was implemented in the NCP by the PRDA, but the roads have not been maintained since then. In addition, 45 bridges also are required to be repaired soon.
North Central Provincial Road Development Authority's spokesman said that for the last five years, the funds being allocated to the NCPRDA for road construction, making improvements to the "C" and "D" roads, and attending to regular road maintenance have been decreasing.
The spokesman pointed out that negligence of road maintenance at regular intervals would worsen the road conditions, adding to the cost of maintenance.
He pointed out that the move to convert the provincial road authority into a department is making slow progress.

LG members in East take oaths before Governor Bogollagama
Serving the masses should be prime objective of new members of the local government and they should work with sincerity for the upliftment of the people, solving their problems, said Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama, addressing the new local government members, who were all of the National Congress.
We are always helpful to you, whenever you approach us. Corruption and malpractice should never be allowed under any circumstance, he said. The Governor was the chief guest at the oath-taking ceremony of the newly elected LG members of Akkaraipattu Municipal Council and the Akkaraipattu, Addalaichenai, Pottuvil, Kalmunai and Mutur Pradeshiya Sabhas elected from the National Congress. The ceremony was held at Akkaraipattu Athaullah Arangam under the patronage of the Leader of the National Congress and former minister A.L.M. Athaullah where National Congresss supporters were present in large numbers.
The Governor detailed the duties of the newly elected members and said that his government of good governance headed by the President of Sri Lanka is all out to build a united Sri Lanka and the President is trying his best to maintain a cordial relationship with other countries. Now that President Maithripala Sirisena is in Pakistan on the invitation of Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, bilateral talks are benefiting our countries. So its our duty to maintain our countrys reputation and image.
He also said, We are ever ready to help you. Your former minister Athaullah is a good friend of mine and was a close associate in Parliament. So you all can make use of his talents and capabilities for the welfare of the area..

Life lessons from Tolkien
Happy March, friends. I like to call it Middle Earth March. I specifically look forward to March 25th each year. In the Tolkienverse, its the Gondorian New Year, the day Sauron fell, the One Ring was destroyed, and the beginning of the Fourth Age of Gondor. Its often celebrated as Tolkien Reading Day, the theme of which this year is Home and Hearth: the many ways of being a hobbit. March 25 was also my almost-birthday. On this day, I fix many meals (first and second breakfast, luncheon, afternoon tea, dinner, and supper) and hole up with a Tolkien book. Ha ha, get it In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit Anyway.
Sometimes I reread an old favorite and revisit The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings to remember some of my favorite life lessons from Tolkien. Other times, Ill pick a less-familiar work. Its been probably 20 years and more since I read The Silmarillion, and I havent read Leaf by Niggle but once. Might be the year for that. Who knows I did start reading The Hobbit to my daughter for the first time. Shes seven and so far is mightily impressed that Bilbo gets second breakfast at all. On the Gondorian New Year, Ill definitely make all the food for her. Im determined to make her a Tolkien fan.
As a lifelong Tolkien fan myself, it is natural for me to reread the books every couple years. Each time, I discover something entirely new in them. Ive always changed in some way between readings, grown older, hopefully a little wiser, and so I pick up new things in the text. Its like an English trifle, each reading revealing a new layer to reveal some new treasure within. Its delightful. I honestly dont know if it is just because I love Tolkiens works so much, or if they are just that rich, or what, because there are any number of other books that I adore and reread often but dont find that much new in them upon rereading. In any case, there are many life lessons Tolkien that Ive learned over the years. Just a few of the ones I have found to be the most meaningful are below.
There are many paths to tread
This line always reminds me that there are diverse ways to live life and many ways to achieve a common goal. Not everyone has to do things the same way I would do it. I can be a bit of a control freak sometimes, more so when I was younger, and this helped me remember that people come at situations differently and with unique skills. There is more than one right way to do things.
All that is gold does not glitter
Dont judge someone based on their looks. Even now, many of us still need this reminder. Aragorn was initially presented as the scary-looking Strider, one of the rugged Rangers of the North. Upon first introduction, no one would ever suspect he is the true King of Gondor, Aragorn Elessar son of Arathorn, who will become one of the greatest and most beloved rulers of all Middle Earth. Obviously he cleans up pretty good, but its whats inside that got the job done.
Inspiration can come anytime, from anywhere
Pay attention. Everything and anything can serve as inspiration and writing fodder. An example from Humphrey Carpenters J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography explains that when Tolkien and his little brother were children, they had got chased out of a field by a terrifying farmer because they were picking his mushrooms. Sound familiar
Art/Writing/Learning is a lifelong process
Be patient. You dont have to do everything before the age of 30. Or 40. Or within a year. Tolkien took 14 years to write Lord of the Rings and kept writing and building his world for his entire life. He did all his writing in his spare time while he was working at his day job, teaching a variety of university courses at Leeds or Oxford, which is what actually put food on the table. You dont have to do it all right away, and you dont have to make your living as a writer. Its okay to take your time.
Darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer
Be hopeful. Do you know the unimaginable shit Tolkien endured in his life He was put through the wringer and still managed to believe that everything isnt just hopeless bullshit. I dont think he could have written an epic about good triumphing over evil without a large element of hope living in him.
Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens
Be loyal. Everyone comes to difficult times, but brave and true friends will stay beside you through nightfall and despite quaking hearts and to the end of all things.
Home is behind, the world ahead
Be curious. Go out and have an adventure and see all the places of the world while you can. Embrace change and new things.
Deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised
Be humble. You dont need recognition for everything you do. Heroes dont do heroic things for praise and glory. They do it to help people, or because its the right thing to do, or because it needs doing. Parents dont care for their children because they want thanks. They do it out of love. We take care of our honored elders because they deserve it. What need is there of praise when doing a good deed should be reward enough on its own

A little act to realise a BIG dream
The Little Hearts project is not new to the warmhearted Sri Lankans. Initiated by the s, the project aims at constructing a Cardiac and Critical Care complex at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital to treat children diagnosed of Congenital Heart Diseases (CDH).
Every year over 3,000 children are born with CDH. Each day throughout infancy is a battle to keep their little hearts beating. Those who survive infancy are restricted to a life of continuous medication, visits to the hospital, restrictive diets and worst of all, the inability to play or exert themselves like any other child.
Several generous organizations and civil groups have come forward to fund this worthy project. One such corporate is DSL Enterprises (Pvt.) Ltd. which together with its own subsidiary, Bluminz (Pvt) Ltd, introduced Speed Little Hearts Pens and Camlin Little Hearts Pencils last year. These pens and pencils are specially marketed to fund the Little Hearts project with 20 percent and 13 percent from the sales being donated respectively.
Introduced in September 2017 the sale of Speed pens and Camlin pencils has successfully increased over the past few months. As a result, DSL Enterprises has achieved Rs. 20 million, a testament to the confidence the public has on the cause. Pens and Pencils are commodities which are purchased regularly. As such, it is one of the simplest ways in which anyone can contribute to the Little Hearts project.
Commenting on the project, Dr. Duminda Samarasinghe, the Consultant Paediatric Cardiologist at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital urged the general public to make the conscious decision to purchase Little Hearts Pens and Pencils when they shop for stationary.
When the Cardiac and Critical Care complex is completed, we will be able to save five children every day. This is our BIG Dream for the Little Hearts, he said.
We Sri Lankans are naturally passionate about causes such as these. Most often we are set back by the fact that we cannot afford to financially spare high amounts to support projects. With the Little Hearts Pens and Pencils, there is no need for second thought because you will be contributing in your own possible way by simply buying the Speed Pens and Camlin Pencils. It is heartwarming to know that each one of us can do our part and this is what we want all Sri Lankans to feel, he added.
For DSL Enterprises, the Little Hearts Project in the most valuable project as it is a need of the time. Expressing his view, the Group Managing Director and Founder of DSL Enterprises (Pvt) Ltd, Asitha Wijerathne stated, We are grateful to all our consumers, especially school children, who have continued to buy our Speed pens and Camlin pencils. As a team, we have wholeheartedly dedicated our resources and effort to achieve this goal and I thank my team as well as our stakeholders for their contribution so far. We are proud to hand over the first installment and look forward to reach our target very soon.
At present over 250 million rupees has been accumulated through donors for the Little Hearts Project. It is further supported with another Rs. 170 million pledged from two organizations and Rs. 300 million allocated from the national budget by the Sri Lankan Government. The piling for the complex is set to commence in May 2018. The call for tenders for pile construction has been published in the newspapers on February 4 and the pre-bid meeting was held on February 20 of the same month. The Sri Lanka Navy will be responsible for construction and the complex is to be handed over to the hospital in November 2019.

Maersk Lanka fills 50% vacancies with women
Maersk Lanka recently marked a noteworthy accomplishment in the local shipping arena, by filling 50% of their top management with talented female role models.
The ladies, Randima Krishnaratne, Udani Warnakula, Kushani Ekanayake and Nadeera Abeykoon joined MAERSK from diverse industries ranging from FMCG, Banking, HR and Logistics.
Randima is the Country Sales Manager for Sri Lanka, responsible for achieving the countrys sales volume, and managing and guiding the sales team towards optimal performance.
Udani, the key Account Manager for Sri Lanka, manages the existing customer portfolio and focuses on acquiring new customers.
Kushani leads the Sri Lanka customer service team to support and drive positive customer experiences across Maersks broad spectrum of services.
Nadeera, as the Human Resources Business Partner is in charge of workforce planning, recruitment, talent management, leadership development and implementing the Strategic HR initiatives of the organization.
All the ladies suggested having more females on boards and senior management positions was important, as studies show that companies who do not have a well-balanced gender workforce and leadership team, under-perform in the market in contrast to those companies who have successfully achieved such a balance.
Giving their perspective in what they believe are the biggest challenges for women in leadership roles in Sri Lanka, they said the key barrier they saw were the difficulties women encounter in balancing their personal lives with work, which has stood in the way of women getting into higher levels in management.
They voiced that local companies therefore should identify and update policies and procedures to support the upward mobility of women. These should combine greater development opportunities to expand the pipeline of women in supervisory and managerial positions. They cited that diversity and inclusion should not be about gender but about attracting talent and that both businesses and government should play an important role in closing the gender gap that currently exists in the workplace.
Country Manager, MAERSK Sri Lanka, Zeeshan Mukhi said, We invest in diversity because we want to be able to attract from 100% of the talent pool and because it makes better business sense. We are very happy to have a diverse leadership team in Sri Lanka and this demonstrates our long-standing commitment to equal opportunity and gender diversity.

NCM will be a flop - Rajitha
The No-Confidence Motion (NCM) tabled against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be a flop since it can be easily defeated in Parliament, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was speaking to the media after participating in the World Tuberculosis Day walk which began from Independence Square to the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute premises on March 24.
Dr. Senaratne said they would join hands with all forces to defeat the No-Confidence Motion.
This government would continue till 2020. As the day coincided with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes birthday, he wished to greet the Prime Minister and wish him long life and ability to serve the people as the Prime Minister for a long time.
Dr. Senaratne said world attention had now been drawn towards eradicating Tuberculosis. The WHO had launched several programmes to achieve this objective as over 10 million Tuberculosis patients have been reported world wide.
The Health Ministry too had launched several programmes to educate the people towards eradicating this disease. Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa and other official participated.

New system to repatriate deceased abroad, conduct last rites
The Foreign Affairs Ministry has introduced a new system to submit documentation relating to Sri Lankans deceased abroad through Divisional Secretariats.
The Consular Affairs Division of the Foreign Affairs Ministry in coordination with the Home Affairs Ministry has introduced the new system through which relatives of Sri Lankans deceased abroad are allowed to submit identity documents, affidavits, and other documentation relating to the repatriation of human remains or conduct of last rites through Divisional Secretariats island-wide.
Secretary to the Home Affairs Ministry has already issued a circular instructing all Divisional Secretaries to extend required assistance for the effective implementation of the initiative.
So far, relatives of deceased person were required to submit such documents to the Consular Affairs Division to bring human remains to Sri Lanka, or to get authorisation to conduct last rites abroad. Under the new system, the relatives of the deceased could submit the documentation to the nearest Divisional Secretariat, which in turn would forward them to the Consular Affairs Division for appropriate action.
The new system allows relatives of deceased to have their required documentation processed at the nearest Divisional Secretariat without having the need to travel to the Consular Affairs Division in Colombo or the Regional Consular Office in Jaffna.
The general public in outstation areas would particularly benefit from the new arrangement and avoid the need for travelling long distances to Colombo or Jaffna at a time of bereavement as well as undue delays and expenditure.
The initiative is part of the endeavours of the Foreign Affairs Ministry to streamline, decentralise and improve consular service delivery to the public.

No decision has been taken to increase fuel prices in CEYPETCO fuel stations, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga said.
However, the Lanka Indian Oil Corporation (LIOC) functions in the Sri Lankan petroleum market increased the price of a litre of petrol by Rs. 9 and a liter of diesel by Rs. 5 with effect from midnight Friday (23). Following the increase the price of 92 octane petrol is Rs 126 while the price of Auto Disel is Rs 100 at the LIOC fuel stations while the price of 92 octane petrol is Rs 117 while the price of Auto Disel is Rs 95.
The media witnessed the number of vehicles showed up at the CPC fuel stations yesterday was comparatively high to the previous days. However responding to a query by media during a press conference on Thursday Petroleum Resources Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said that there were requests from the LIOC to increase the fuel prices on several occasions.

Power demand peaks to 2500 mw
No power cuts, assures Minister
The demand for electricity surged to a whopping 2500 MW on Friday (23) extending to the weekend making it the highest demand for electricity in recent months.
This is particularly owing to the prevailing and rising temperature. Officials however, assured that there wont be any power cuts despite this continuing increase in demand, State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P. Perera told the Daily News.
We have enough power on the National Grid. Our reservoir storage levels are satisfactory and fortunately for the Norochcholai power plant which is functioning smoothly, we will not have any power cuts, he said.
Meanwhile, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya addressing an event over the weekend remarked that more attention should be drawn to solar power which can meet the rising demand.
The Ceylon Electricity Board recorded an increase in peak power demand on Friday (23) to 2500 Megawatts before fluctuating to 2467 megawatts yesterday.
While the demand is expected to surge in the coming days, particularly on weekdays, we are confident of handling the upsurge in consumption and can safely guarantee that there will not be any power cuts, State Minister Perera said.
Attributing the surge in consumption to the prevailing high temperature he added that such weather conditions coupled with an increase of 10 percent demand for electricity year on year, increase the cost of power generation.
He added that for the moment only 40 percent of the total electricity requirement is generated by way of hydro power plant while the rest is generated by thermal power plants using diesel as fuel. He added that thermal power is very costly but the solar power could be generated at the lower cost.
It is unfortunate that a country like Sri Lanka which benefits from such hot climes throughout the year is unable to generate solar power, Minister Siyamabalapitiya said.
The Cabinet of Ministers have decided to provide solar power panels free of charge to public in an effort to popularize and educate the general public on this, he said.
The minister made these observations at ceremony to provide solar panels free of charge to the Rambukkana Hospital. Solar panels were also handed over to the Kegalle and the Aranayake Hospitals.
Minister Siyamabalapitiya said the consumer can get electricity free of charge and can sell the excess to the Ceylon Electricity Board. He also added that though a unit of electricity is provided to a household at a rate of Rs 4.00 an excessive unit of solar power is bought from them at a rate of Rs 22.00.
Minister Siyambalapitiya stated that so far the solar power panels are not popular as expected and the government has planned to provide them free of charge to institutions such as divisional secretariats, hospitals, temples etc.
Tussle over long term generation plan rages on
Issuing an ultimatum the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union (CEBEU) has announced that they would initiate a work-to-rule campaign in two weeks, if the government does not intervene and resolve issues relating to the Last Cost Long Term Generation Plan (LCLTGP).
Speaking to the Daily News, the unionist cite that the regulator for the power sector, the Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) had engineered a plan of its own which they say is illegal.
The PUCSL has created a LCLTGP setting aside the proposed plan by the CEB, which puts the power sector into disarray. It is due to this that that we dont have a single plant in the pipeline.
EBEU Executive Committee Member Athula Wanniarachchi told the Daily News, that they met with the Prime Minister last month, who was also of the opinion that the sector was in a disadvantaged due to the confusion.
We have been protesting against this matter for months, and have not resorted to strike action due to the uncertain political climate. However we have realized that the government is yet to heed any interest and will therefore initiate a work-to-rule in two weeks, he said.
However State Minister for Power and Energy Minister Ajith P. Perera confirmed to the Daily News that the Ministry was working with CEB and other stakeholders to resolve the matter and promised a solution would be put forth within the next two weeks.
I cannot detail the meetings but we are in discussions and will reach a solution.
Meanwhile the PUCSL, released a report last year in November, stating that Implementation issues pertaining to power plants identified in (LCLTGEP) has resulted in serious problems such as cost overruns and load shedding. The financial loss due to non-implementation/delaying of the approved power plants over the last 20years is enormous and the economic/impact of load shedding and high prices is much bigger. And the issue of implementation delays or non-implementation of power plants is not some past phenomena, but something very much prevalent even at present.

Obesity dulls sense of taste
Researchers have identified how obesity dulls the sense of taste, driving people to eat larger quantities of calorie-rich foods to satisfy their cravings. More than one third of American adults are obese and that number is growing rapidly, creating an urgent need for a better understanding of the disease and how it can be treated.
Obesity has been linked to a reduced taste sensitivity that leads people to seek out foods that are richer in sugar, salt and fat to get the same amount of satisfaction. Researchers at Cornell University have identified the mechanism behind the dulled sense of taste, revealing a possible new avenue for treatment.
Previous studies have found that weight gain reduces the number of taste buds on the tongue and that losing the weight reverses the reduction, but it was unclear how or why. A taste bud is made up of about 50 to 100 cells belonging to one of three groups that each have a different role in sensing the five primary tastes: salt, sweet, bitter, sour, and umami.
'Taste buds operate not only as sensors of essential nutrients but can also trigger powerful central reward from the consumption of hedonically pleasing food,' Robin Dando, a lead researcher on the study, said.
'Obese individuals have been reported to display a weakened sense of taste and thus may be driven to consume more calories to attain such reward,' he said.
Researchers from Cornell's department of food science and the department of molecular biology split mice into two groups, one that was fed a normal diet of 14 per cent fat and one that was fed a diet of 58 per cent fat.
After eight weeks the mice on the high-fat diet weighed 30 per cent more, but were found to have 25 per cent fewer taste buds than the lean mice. Taste buds have an average lifespan of 10 days because of a quick turnover process that involves a balanced combination of cell death and generation of new cells.
The researchers found that in obese mice, the rate of cell death increased while there was a decrease in the number of cells responsible for generation. However, mice that were genetically resistant to becoming obese did not show the same results even when they were fed a high-fat diet, which led the researchers to conclude that they're a result of the accumulation of fatty tissue rather than just the consumption of fat.
Previous research has shown that fatty tissue produce inflammatory proteins, and in this study the researchers found that the high-fat diet increased the level of one of those proteins called TNF-alpha. A subset of the mice was genetically resistant to becoming obese and was incapable of making TNF-alpha.
When fed the high-fat diet, those mice gained weight but did not have a decrease in taste buds.
The researchers were able to replicate the effects of the high-fat diet on number of taste buds by injecting TNF-alpha into the tongues of the lean mice. Overall the findings suggest that chronic exposure to a high fat diet leading to excess fatty tissue is linked to inflammation that interferes with the balancing system in taste bud turnover.

Oil price crosses $70  amid Iran deal tensions
Crude oil prices posted their biggest weekly gain in eight months with rising geopolitical risk in the Middle East threatening security supply once again.
International benchmark Brent crude gained 6.6 percent this week, briefly reaching $70.58 a barrel on Friday.
American benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose 5.7 percent this week and climbed as high as $66 a barrel.
While both benchmarks reached Friday their highest level since January 29, they also posted their best weekly gains since the last week of July 2017.
Oil prices gained momentum after investors saw increasing possibility that the US could withdraw from the historic Iran nuclear deal, and heightened worries in tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia could revive.
President Donald Trump signalled this week that he is still considering withdrawing the US from the nuclear deal.
This could bring back sanctions on the country and seriously limit Tehrans capability to export crude oil and oil products to the global market.
In addition, the US has increased arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the regional rival of Iran. Rising tensions between the two heavyweights suggest that any supply disruption from the Middle East could threaten the global oil market. (www.aljazeera.com)

Opportunistic Vettel steals victory from Hamilton
MELBOURNE, Sunday: Sebastian Vettel made full use of the virtual safety car to sneak in front of Lewis Hamilton and hold off the frustrated champion to win Formula Ones season-opening Australian Grand Prix on Sunday.
The Mercedes engines infamous party mode that delivered Hamilton a blistering pole lap on Saturday could do little once Ferraris Vettel nosed ahead when re-entering from pit-lane midway through the race at Albert Park.
Pole-sitter Hamilton had appeared set to coast to victory with a clear pace advantage but the race turned on its head with the safety car, which was called after Romain Grosjeans Haas failed and rolled to a stop at turn two.
In another bonus for Ferrari, Kimi Raikkonen finished third, fending off Red Bulls Daniel Ricciardo and leaving the unlucky Australian still searching for a first podium in his home race.

Pope urges young people not to remain silent
Pope Francis on Sunday urged young people not to allow themselves to be silenced and to stand up for what they believe in, a day after more than a million people in the United States took part in student-led protests demanding tighter gun control.
Dear young people, you have it in you to shout, the pontiff told the traditional Palm Sunday mass on Saint Peters Square, which this year coincides with World Youth Day.
While the pope was not talking about the US protests and made no reference to them in his address, his comments came just a day after huge gun control rallies were staged all across the US.
It is up to you not to keep quiet, Francis told young people.
Even if others keep quiet, if we older people and leaders, so often corrupt, keep quiet, if the whole world keeps quiet and loses its joy, I ask you: Will you cry out The pope said that the temptation had always been there to silence young people.
There were many ways to silence young people and make them invisible, he said.
Many ways to anesthetize them, to make them keep quiet, ask nothing, question nothing. There are many ways to sedate them, to keep them from getting involved, to make their dreams flat and dreary, petty and plaintive. But he pointed to a passage in the Bible where Jesus had been asked to rebuke his disciples for speaking out against injustice.
The pope quoted Jesus reply, saying If these were silent, the very stones would cry out. Please, make that choice, before the stones themselves cry out, he urged young people.
The marches for our lives across the US on Saturday were spearheaded by survivors of a shooting in a Florida high school last month where 17 people were killed.
They are demanding tighter controls on the sales of weapons, especially assault rifles, and directing their fury toward the powerful gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, and politicians who have failed to enact meaningful legislation to address rampant gun violence that kills 30,000 people per year in the US. - AFP

Re-developed Batticaloa Airport unveiled for civil aviation
The Batticaloa Airport (Code : BTC) was redeveloped and opened as a domestic airport yesterday.
The total budget allocated for the reconstruction of the runway, apron and terminal building which was Rs. 1.4 billion was born by the Treasury.
Currently Cinnamon Air is operating twice daily scheduled flights to Batticaloa and a few more airlines, Sakura Air, Southern Air have indicated willingness to commence scheduled flights to Batticaloa
Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Nimal Siripala De Silva who flew in the inaugural scheduled flight with Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe for the opening said that the airport would be a major boost to promote tourism in the area.
In addition we will start building an aviation school before the end of the year, he said.
Batticaloa airport air strip re-laid with a BITUMEN layer would function between sunrise to sunset daily as a civil airport which allows aircraft operations under visual meteorological conditions under the control and supervision of the Airports and Aviation Services (Pvt) Ltd. Sri Lanka Air Force will not get involved in the operation of the airport other than handing its own flights. The Government encourages establishment of flying schools and related industries centering the airport aiming at resurrection and up keeping of social life and conditions of living in the area.
The Government has understood the need of having scheduled air services between domestic airports for sustained promotion of internal air transport and in this context any airline which commences scheduled flights to Batticaloa airport would be given free landing and parking for a period three months from date of opening of the airport for civil use.
Air Traffic Control at the Batticaloa airport would be provided by trained and licensed personnel to provide Air Traffic Control services in accordance with the international standards. Commercial aircraft are allowed to perform self-handing with a view to enhancing the efficiency and bringing down the cost of air travel.
Batticaloa Airport was first opened 60 years ago in November 1958 and was administered by Department of Civil Aviation initially. Army Engineers of the Sri Lanka Army had helped to make the airport operable and it was open to all members of the public.
About 10 years later of its opening, the internal scheduled flights of Air Ceylon, which had been operated between the Ratmalana and Jaffna airports, were extended to cover Batticaloa airport as well.
Air Ceylon used to operate daily flights to Batticaloa via Gal Oya (Ampara) using Nord (French made) aircraft which had 29 seats. The flight between Ratmalana and Batticaloa took only 75 minutes and was in great demand.
However, with the close of Air Ceylon on August 31, 1979, the operation of internal scheduled flights were ceased. On 27 March 1983 an air force took over the operational control of the airport and established an air base at the site.
With a proposal for expansion of the airport in around 1997, about 300 families living close to the airport, were shifted and given alternate land.
With Sri Lankas commemoration of 100 years in aviation in 2012 and the Governments plan to develop internal air travel, a project was launched on September 3, 2012 for the renovation of Batticaloa airport.
The objective of development of the airport was also to help promote influx of tourists into the region by providing safer and expeditious travel instead of letting those spending long hours on roads.
The commencement of the project planned for an extension and overlay to the existing runway, fixing of runway lights and construction of a new terminal building as well as the apron; the area where aircraft are parked. As the Batticaloa runway is locked at either ends between the lagoon, it could not be extended beyond 1,560 meters, which is adequate for operation of 60 seater aircraft. Runway expansion work was done initially by the Road Development Authority (60%) and the balance part was completed by Sri Lanka Air Force.
The airport after renovation was declared open by President Maithripala Sirisena on July 10, 2016. However, formal opening of the airport of civil operations were deferred as the airport had to conform to some of civil aviation requirements, which have now been fulfilled.
The airport has a total land space of 145.2 hectares and the portion there of amounting to 75.9 hectares has been retained by Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) for continued operation of its air base.
Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka has issued an Aerodrome Licence to Airport and Aviation Services Ltd in accordance with the Air Navigation Regulations of 1955 to operate the airport as a civil airport after ascertaining their compliance with the applicable international standards.

Renovated Batticaloa airport opens
The renovated Batticaloa Airport was opened for civilian air traffic yesterday enabling direct air travel to the East.
President Maithripala Sirisena opened the renovated Batticaloa Airport on July 16 last year, which was used only for military operations until then.
The extended runway and passenger terminal at the Sri Lanka Air Force Station were opened by landing a SLAF aircraft with the President on board.
However, operating civilian aircraft got delayed until all necessary facilities were developed to handle passengers.
The first civilian aircraft landed at the airport yesterday with Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe, Ministry Secretary G.S. Vithanage and several other politicians and government officials onboard.
Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said plans were afoot to construct several other domestic airports which had the capability of handling 60 seater domestic flights.
The Minister said that the airport was renovated at a cost of Rs.1400 million.
He further said that this airport has a runway with a length of 1066 metres and a width of 46 metres. The runway is covered with a Bitumen Layer.
The opening of the renovated airport for civilian air traffic could boost tourism to the East as tourists disembarking from the Katunayake International Airport would be able to take a domestic flight to go to the East, he added.
The airport is located 1.7 kilometres from the Batticaloa town in the Seththukuda area. The distance from Katunayake to the Batticaloa airport is 206 kilometres and from Ratmalana airport 222 kilometres.
Several private operators have already voiced interest in operating domestic flights to the airport from Ratmalana. A private operator has already commenced two daily flights from Colombo to Batticaloa.
The government also plans to establish an aviation School within the premises of the airport and when fully operational, it will create a large number of jobs for youth in the area, Minister de Silva added.
State Resettlement and Rehabilitation Minister M.L.A.M. Hisbullah, Batticaloa District Parliamentarians G. Srinesan, S. Yogesweran and Alisahir Mowlana, Batticaloa Government Agent M. Uthayakumar, Civil Aviation Director General H.M.C. Nimalsiri and Transport Minstry Secretary G.S. Vithanage were present.

Rotary Club of Negombo celebrates milestone
The Rotary Club of Negombo will celebrate 80 years of service this year, since it received its charter on March 28 in 1938. It is the second oldest Rotary Club in Sri Lanka.
Rotary was introduced to Ceylon, as it was then known, way back in 1929 and quite correctly they identified the capital of the country to form the first Rotary Club; thus the Rotary Club of Colombo was inaugurated on July 5, 1925 and received its charter on December 6, 1929, at a ceremony held at the Galle Face Hotel, Colombo.
Thereafter, they searched for important towns in the country and Negombo was identified as one such town for the propagation of Rotary islandwide. Due preference and recognition was given to Negombo. The Rotary Club of Negombo came to be sponsored by the Rotary Club of Colombo in 1937 and received its charter the following year. The Club was formed with 24 members selected from amongst the elite businessmen and professionals in the area.
T.W. Hockley who was the head of Police, Municipal Commissioner and District Judge, has the singular honour of being elected as the charter President of the club and held the office of the President of the club during the Rotary year 1937-38.
Over the past 79 years, the club has engaged in humanitarian and service-oriented work and has grown in maturity and strength to be one of the foremost Rotary clubs in the Rotary District 3220, said incumbent President Rtn. Expedit Croos.
As per convention, Rotary membership is exclusive to professionals, proprietary planters, and businessmen of repute in the area. Respected politicians of the calibre of the late Shirley Corea and former Speaker of the House of Representatives and Parliamentarian, late Paris Perera were all past Presidents of the club.
The club records a rich heritage of membership comprising a blend of lawyers, doctors, engineers, architects, and businessmen of repute, currently with a membership of 62.
Croos observed that they their work has been mostly concentrated in and around Negombo, but, at times, has also extended even up to Kilinochchi when required.
Our work in the recent past emulates our desire to be the top-most club in the region, he added.
The event will be celebrated under the theme Mighty Eighty Anniversary with two separate musical shows being held on April 6 and 7, 2018.
On April 6, they will have a musical evening at Grandeeza, Negombo, at 7.30 pm, followed with Chai Sundown at Jetwing Beach Hotel, Negombo, on April 7, at 5pm.

Seamless process for project approvals soon - BOI
The Board of Investment (BOI) will have a very seamless process in terms of getting approvals for projects by the third quarter of this year, said Duminda Ariyasinghe, Director General, BOI.
He made these remarks addressing the 38th AGM of the Free Trade Zone Manufacturers Association (FTZMA) held in Seeduwa on Thursday.
Ariyasinghe said this will be implemented in two phases initially dealing with six agencies starting in April and then with 18 other agencies with a total of 24 by September, October this year.
In fact we had a very detailed meeting with all the Heads of the first six agencies and we are having MoUs so that there are specific service guarantees by each of these agencies in terms of how long they will take. They will be held answerable and it will be escalated right up to Cabinet level in terms of how this entire system is performing, he said.
Ariyasinghe said that they were also focusing on developing new export processing zones (EPZ) since substantial work has not been done in setting up EPZs since 2002 and as a result all the current zones were almost full. The BOI Director General said they were currently working on four different zones which were happening simultaneously.
We have had funding from the budget as well as BOIs own resources. So together we are working to make sure that these zones will be setup in the next two to three years.
Ariyasinghe said they had already started the land procurement and the most advanced of them was the one in Horana Milleniya which is a 250 acre zone, a joint venture between the BOI and Thailands Rojana Group. The government in this years budget has allocated over Rs 2.5 billion for these new zones, he said.
In the last few decades there have been many instances where the rules have been changed and the goal posts moved, and that is not what should be happening, he cautioned.
The single window investment approving committee will evaluate proposals in a very objective basis and has set out the basic important parameters of a project including the financial history of the company.
This will enable the committee to decide immediately whether it was a project that can go through and can be approved.
 If there are any deficiencies we immediately go back to the investor and tell him what he has to fix and come back to us and we are able to provide an approval to that project, the Director General added.
Fazal Abdeen, was reappointed as Chairman of FTZMA at the AGM.

Smith to stay captain while CA probes ball-tampering scandal
MELBOURNE, Sunday: Cricket Australia said Sunday that Steve Smith will remain captain while they investigate the ball-tampering scandal during the third Test against South Africa which has plunged the game into crisis.
There have been calls for Smith to step down or be sacked over the premeditated plan hatched during the lunch break on Saturday's third day in Newlands, after the captain admitted being the mastermind.
Chief executive James Sutherland said Sunday Cricket Australia were extremely disappointed and shocked but added that the governing body wanted to get a clearer picture of the facts before making any decisions.
I understand that that is not necessarily the fullness of response that everyone is looking for right now. But you will appreciate that there's an element of process that needs to be undertaken here, Sutherland told reporters in Melbourne.
We will work very hard over the next couple of days to get to the bottom of it -- to understand the big picture, to understand the detail and to be making further comment on that in due course.
Cameras showed Cameron Bancroft with a yellow object in his hand. (Fox Sports)
CA's head of integrity and head of team performance were flying to South Africa to conduct the investigation.
Television footage showed Smith's teammate Cameron Bancroft, 25, taking a yellow object out of his pocket while fielding in the post-lunch session and appearing to rub it on the ball.
He was later charged with attempting to change the condition of the ball.
Sutherland said he had not spoken to Smith but stressed repeatedly he was unhappy about the incident.
I have very strong and clear views about the responsibility of the Australian cricket team to play the game in the right spirit, he added.
And I don't think anyone will be under any illusions as to what I think about this.
Smith, 28, has said he would not quit, adding: I still think I'm the right person for the job.
BLATANT CHEATING
The CA chief said Australian cricket fans had every reason to wake up and not be proud of the team.
This is a very sad day for Australian cricket. I'm not happy about this at all ... And I feel like Australian cricket fans feel right now.
There was widespread disbelief and anger in Australia as the news hit the headlines on Sunday morning, with Smith's predecessor Michael Clarke saying he was feeling pretty emotional.
I can't believe if the leadership group has made a decision to do this, that they have gone and got the young kid (Bancroft) who is playing his eighth test match to do that, Clarke told broadcaster Channel Nine.
Clarke said he felt sorry for Smith, but added that the tampering was blatant cheating.
It is disgraceful. It is not accepted by anyone. Particularly in Australia. We've got the best bowling attack in the world. We don't need to cheat to beat anybody.
Players body the Australian Cricketers Association said in a statement Sunday that it seems serious errors of judgement have been committed.
It is right for match officials and Cricket Australia to investigate the full extent of what has transpired. Cricket is a sport synonymous with the highest standards of behaviour, the statement said.
Standards which must be observed at all times. And standards upheld and nurtured by generations of players.  AFP

South Africa v Australia - flash points
CAPE TOWN, Saturday: The 2018 Test series between South Africa and Australia has been plagued by controversy on and off the field.
AFP Sports looks at the flash points following Saturday's stunning confession of ball-tampering by Australia captain Steve Smith and teammate Cameron Bancroft:
1ST TEST, DURBAN:
-- Australia vice-captain David Warner and South Africa wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock clash as the teams head for the dressing rooms.
Warner claims he was reacting to a vile and disgusting remark about his wife by De Kock.
Both players were punished for the bust-up with Warner fined 75 percent of his match fee and De Kock 25 percent.
Warner said he was used to taking flak from fans and opposition players, but claimed De Kock's remark crossed a line.
The other day I was probably out of line. I've seen the footage and I regret the way it played out but for me -- it is how I am and I responded emotionally and regretted the way I played out, he said.
But I'll always stick up for my family.
2ND TEST, PORT ELIZABETH
-- South Africa fast bowler Kagiso Rabada is banned for two matches after barging into Australia skipper Steve Smith.
However, Rabada successfully appealed and was cleared to play in the third Test in Cape Town.
The ICC have set the standard, haven't they There was clearly contact out in the middle, said Smith.
I certainly won't be telling my bowlers to go out there and after you take a wicket go and get in their space. I don't think that is on and part of the game. But the standard has been set.
3RD TEST, CAPE TOWN
-- Australia laid an official complaint over what coach Darren Lehmann labelled disgraceful behaviour by spectators.
You are talking about abuse of various players and their families and personal abuse, said Lehmann.
It's not on at a cricket game - not just here, it shouldn't happen. You can have banter, that's good fun, but it's gone too far here.
The principal target was Warner, who was approached by a spectator in the members stand after he was dismissed, causing Warner to stop and turn as he climbed the steps to the dressing room.
The pair appeared to exchange heated words with unconfirmed reports saying the spectator was evicted from the ground.
Some spectators who aimed lewd chants at Warner's wife, Candice, were ejected from Newlands.
-- On Saturday, Smith and Bancroft admit ball-tampering after Bancroft is seen using a yellow object to alter the condition of the ball.
I want to be accountable for my actions, said Bancroft.
Smith admitted it was a pre-meditated plan: The leadership group knew about it. We spoke about it at lunch. I'm not proud of what happened. It's not in the spirit of the game. -AFP

Spices might get teens to like vegetables
A dash of cumin or dill might help convince high school students to load up their plate with vegetables during lunchtime in the cafeteria, a small study suggests.
Researchers got about 100 high school students in rural Pennsylvania to taste a variety of plain vegetables seasoned with just oil and salt and then try the same vegetables flavored with different spice blends. Participants rated how well they liked each dish and then indicated whether they preferred the plain or spiced up recipe.
Students liked broccoli, cauliflower, vegetable dip, and black beans mixed with corn better when recipes included a spice blend, the study found.
When forced to choose between plain vegetables and vegetables seasoned with spice blends, students preferred the spicy versions for corn and peas, broccoli, vegetable dip, black beans with corn, and cauliflower, the study also found.
This is important because we really need to make sure we are focusing on improving the vegetables served in schools to make sure students take interest in eating them, said lead study author Juliana Fritts of Pennsylvania State University in University Park.
Vegetable intake is still SO low in adolescents and adults, and these are so important for health, so we really still need to be working harder at either making vegetables tastier or encouraging people to purchase and eat more vegetables, Fritts said by email.
Teen girls should eat four servings of vegetables a day, and teen boys should eat five, U.S. dietary guidelines recommend. One serving of vegetables could be one cup of leafy greens, a half-cup of cooked or raw veggies, or three-fourths of a cup of vegetable juice.
Most students surveyed at the start of the study said the taste, the serving size, and the foods appearance were very important characteristics of school meals.
Roughly three in four students said disliking the taste stopped them from eating vegetables. More than half also said they didnt like the vegetables served in school.
Most students were familiar with common spices like cinnamon, garlic powder, black pepper, chili powder, oregano and basil, surveys also found. Very few of them were familiar with cumin, allspice, curry, and sage.
The students tasted different vegetables, sometimes plain and other times with added spices, during lunch periods on different school days. Cafeterias served canned or frozen vegetables similar to what they would normally prepare for school lunches.
Sensory scientists and research chefs at the McCormick Science Institute, which funded the study, developed the recipes for the experiment. McCormick makes spices sold in grocery stores and to industrial and commercial customers.
One limitation of the study is that participation was voluntary, and its possible students who agreed to sample different vegetables had different preferences or opinions about veggies than the kids who declined to participate, researchers note in the journal Food Quality and Preference.
Another drawback is that researchers didnt test whether a stronger preference for vegetables with spices translated into teens actually eating more vegetables. Still, the approach tested in the study would be a low-cost and simple strategy to try in school cafeterias because its using products that are already staples of school lunch programs, said Gregory Madden, a researcher at Utah State University in Logan.
Increasing the variety of vegetables served can modestly increase consumption, Madden, who wasnt involved in the study, said by email. A more effective strategy is to get rid of competing foods on the plate.

PM tells Parliament
State of emergency for seven days
Cabinet decided to impose a State of Emergency for seven days taking stock of the current situation in the country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday.
The Prime Minister said the other relevant laws to impose a State of Emergency would be enacted in the country temporarily.
He made this observation taking part in a Special Adjournment Debate moved by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake on the prevailing unrest in the country.
The Prime Minister giving a brief account on the two incidents in Ampara and Teldeniya, stressed that the series of violent acts which followed were deliberate attempts by an organised gang to inflame racial tensions, adding that those could not be underplayed as happened out of sudden anger. He said while the Buddhist monks and Muslim clergy in the area tried to resolve the issues, groups that came from outside created chaos.
The Prime Minister promised that swift measures would be taken to provide relief and pay compensation for the property damaged and affected people.
The Premier pledged the Government would not hesitate to implement the law against the culprits who triggered racial violence, adding that the IGP was conducting a special investigation on the shortcomings on the part of Police in maintaining law and order.
He said action would be taken against any officer found to have neglected his duty. However, he appreciated the efforts of Police personnel to control the situation and maintain law and order.
He told the House that the National Security Council which met on Monday night instructed the Heads of Security Forces and Police to take urgent steps to restore normalcy and immediately implement the law against those involved in violent acts. They have been instructed to be on alert to control any unrest that might ensue.
He emphasised that the Government condemns the recent violent and racial acts in the strongest possible manner, reminding that 30 years brutal war had taught the nation the importance of peace, unity and freedom.
We see that certain power hungry groups are planning various conspiracies and acts of sabotage to disrupt the public life. Racism is their only resort. They try to grab power by creating terror in the country. They spread false and distorted information profoundly by the social media. One such group was engaged in this vicious campaign for the last nine months. As a result a heated situation has erupted in the country, he pointed out while emphasising the Governments commitment to protect the Sinhala Buddhist heritage and rights of all other ethnic and religious groups in the country, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
He made an appeal to the public not to fall prey to those who try to fulfil their petty gains by inciting racism, but to act patiently and rationally. He pointed out Police was swift to arrest the four suspects who assaulted an individual on February 22 who later succumbed to his injuries on March 3.
We cannot let anybody to take the law into the hands. The public confidence in law and order has been deteriorated. We have to restore this confidence from the legal action we take in the coming days, the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister, observing that the reports in social media reach the entire world, pointed out false and racist propaganda on social media is a disgrace to the country.

Super Fashion to open mega stores in Piliyandala and Ja-Ela
Super Fashion Panadura will be opening two mega stores in Piliyandala and Ja-Ela this year and will be launching their own online delivery arm. The retail store would also be celebrating their seventh anniversary in May.
The General Manger, Chathura Hathurusinghe, M. Jayatissa said that Super Fashion Panadura, was built by famed educationist, Dudley Peiris on a 15 perch abandoned land opposite the Panadura Police station in 2007 and its initial plan was to offer the building on rent. However the eldest son, Janaka (current Managing Director), saw the vacuum for a quality Mega cloth store in Panadura and decided to create Super Fashion Panadura taking a calculated risk. 
Merchandise were imported from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, China and India and local items too were on sale and Super Fashion Panadura became an instant success.
Due to this phenomenal growth, three years after its operation we added two additional floors and increased the permanent staff carder to 125.
He however said that Sri Lankan suppliers are very slow in adopting to change, creating new designs and innovation this is the reason they still import.
We have many CSR activities targeting our employees and also the public. We also host and an annual staff get-together where our suppliers too are recognized and this year the event will be held on May 1, at Blue Water Wadduwa.
Outlining their plans for 2018 he said that they will be opening two mega stores in Piliyandala and Ja Ela this year. Currently we offer online purchases and soon we would be creating a special unit for free delivery within 40 km by our own staff.
