Ravana no more in hibernation
According to historical sources, our motherland was much bigger 5000 years back. The major portion of it is now buried at sea and only one eighth of the land is visible as Sri Lanka.
Rajawaliya says, due to misdeed committed by Ravana, his entire empire was buried at sea.
Is Atlantis another name for Ravanas land which now is concealed under the seabed Had the tectonic plates of the Earths surface shifted that land to a distant place of the globe over the centuries
Is Ravanas Dandu Monara aka Pushpaka Vimana still in existence and kept safely in an isolated place, here in our country
Some historians say Ravana being a member of the Galactic Federation had ruled 10 worlds in our galaxy which are depicted by the ten heads of his. They also opine galactic federation is keeping Rawanas hibernated body hid in a place until the right time for making his comeback.
Ra means the Sun and it is said, the Sun induced energy (solar energy) to Dandu Monara to be airborne. In an Indian annual festival, Ravanas effigies are burned even now as he was Ramas arch-rival.
Ramayanaya Nurthi
The Indian hermit Valmiki in 500 BC wrote the poetic tale of Ramayana even before Mahabharata was written.
This mind blowing story provided many insights to artistes, especially to dramatists and filmmakers world over. Sri Lankan attorney and playwright John de Silva wrote the script and made Ramayanaya Nurthi in 1933. Film director Manik Sadrasagara casted Gamini Fonseka as Ravana in his film Sita Devi that was made based on Ramayanaya. The song Nimhim Sewwa in the film sung by maestro Amaradewa became an evergreen one.
The visionary, Kalasuri Arisen Ahubudu made his own version of Ramayanaya play as Sakvithi Ravana decades back. Its hit song was Pombule Mage Pombule.
The original Ramayanaya Nurthi based on John de Silvas play has been reproduced now. Branded yet again as Ramayanaya Nurthi it is directed and edited this time around by Kalabhushana Lionel Gunatilleke. The play focuses on school children and the general public as its target viewer segments.
Nimal Jayasinghe is the assistant director of the Ramayanaya Nurthi and it is presented by the Tower Hall Theatre Foundation.Ramayanaya Nurthis second performance in 2017 presented by the Tower Hall Theatre Foundation in association with the education ministry was staged on October 31 at the Tower Hall. The occasion was graced by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and former state minister of child affairs and deputy head of the Prime Ministers office, Rosy Senanayake.
Since Ramayanaya is in the school curriculum now, it is very important for parents to come with their children and watch this Nurthi. School Principals could contribute by staging the play for the benefit of school children, says Kalabhushana Gunatilleke.
The essence of Valmikis Ramayanaya is in my Nurthi. Pandit Vishvanath Lauji who was an Indian music maestro had made music scores for John de Silvas Ramayanaya Nurthi and we went by those scores, he added.Nurthi is a form of Art that has a blend of dancing, music and singing embedded in it along with enhanced gestures and facial expressions of the performers. The original Ramayanaya has 54 songs although the newest creation has 34 inclusive of the evergreen Nurthi song, Amba Damba Naaran. Another object of making the new Ramayanaya Nurthi has been to preserve the diminishing art of Nurthi for posterity.
Folklore says Ravana had exceptional powers that astounded people of this world. Though he abducted Sita, the lady of Rama, he never intended to make Sita lose her chastity.
In different time circles there would have been people with exceptional powers who inhabited this world. They would have had the power to be airborne and to interact with beings from other worlds. Ravana represented that clan of exceptional individuals who ruled this world and beyond. The weapon called Rama Sara used by Ravana is similar to a missile used in modern warfare. Rama in desperation would have sought help from Gods to win his final battle with the mighty Ravana, said Gunatilleke.
He added, All these factors being food for thought, I decided to stick to the original story of late John de Silvas play when making the Ramayanaya Nurthi, since the core object was to revive this original Nurthi after decades.
Ranga Weerkoon (late Quintus Weerakoons son), Sanka Jayalath and Iwanka Peiris portray Rama, Ravana and Sita in the Ramayanaya Nurthi.
Tower Hall Theatre Foundations assistant director programs, Chandana Wijesundera Bandara said Ramayanaya Nurthi will be staged again in January 2018.

Reading against the grain
Much to the delight of the coffee-table-book author and the travel connoisseur, Sri Lanka is not only rich in natural beauty, but also equally well-endowed with ornate, detail-laden travel accounts of Westerners encountering its landscape for the first time. The series of publications by the National Trust of Sri Lanka, for instance, or books on her national parks often quote from and excerpt this language.
Where does this language come from At its zenith, the British Empire covered roughly one-fifth of the globe, allowing the associated network of officers, sailors, soldiers and administrators to traverse the thirteen million square miles under its control and write accounts of their time. Time spent in Asia coupled with the requisite Eton-Oxbridge educational combination, lent itself well to the writing of lyrical, evocative prose about the colonies.
Take, for instance, one description from in 1860 given by James Emmerson Tennent, the Irish-born lawyer and statesmen who served in various capacities in Sri Lanka.The laudatory paragraph concludes: Ceylon, from whatever direction its approached, unfolds a scene of loveliness and grandeur unsurpassed, if any land in the universe rivals it.
What prose, what praise. Perhaps it is no surprise that contemporary writers of travel, heritage and nature books continue to recycle such quotations in their books, essays and Instagram posts.
But writing is never neutral, never apolitical.
Conventions of writing
Particularly from the nineteenth century onward, English travel writing (and European travel writing in general) was an established genre with particular conventions; the writing was closer to fiction than to contemporary reporting. Accounts were stylized and ornamented, written to allow Western audiences to partake vicariously in adventures in far-off lands.
In the wake of Edward Saids seminal 1978 work, Orientalism, and other schools of philosophy that focus more on language (such as semiotics), scholars are more alert to how language shapes meaning, cultural attitudes and affect.
Today, centuries after these Victorian travel accounts were recorded, the object has become the subject as Sri Lankans themselves read and recycle these accounts written about them.What should we be alert to when reading How does one read against the grain, that is, read from the vantage point of not taking everything that is written for granted, uncritically, but instead read them with historical awareness and criticism
A simple recipe might be to watch out for eroticization, the trope of the primitive-ideal and selective excerpting.
Paradise myth
Beauty can be dangerous. The scholar Melanie Murrays has argued that the construction of a paradise myth on islands allowed for colonizers to foreground the aesthetic of the places they visited and ignore local humanity. Paradise, after all, relies on oversimplification. Life cannot be messy or complicated in Eden. Characters with too much humanity, intellect or complexity would detract from a story of pristine island peoples untouched by the corruptions of the West.
As such, the appreciation of Sri Lanka often relied on an immutable, native, primitive beauty. The scholar Valerie Packenhams survey of the experiences of Edwardian British citizens (such as Leonard Woolf, Virginia Woolfs husband) travelling in the colonies, remarks on the way in which, despite Westerners disparaging remarks about local customs, almost every Northerner disliked even more what they saw as the consequence of trying to Europeanize and Christianize the natives.
For example, the American author Mark Twain wrote Following the Equator: A Journey Around the World in 1897, narrating his travels around the British Empire three years prior. The text contains one chapter on Ceylon, recounting his visit in 1890. Twain waxes a lyrical about the islands natural beauty: Ceylon present. Dear me, it is beautiful! And most sumptuously tropical, as to character of foliage and opulence of itan oriental charm and mystery, and tropic deliciousnessa line that quivers and tingles with a thousand unexpressed and inexpressible things, that haunt one and find no articulate voice. Twains account is strikingly beautiful, and many of us may feel that it conveys adequately and articulately the wonders of the island.
Elsewhere in the text Twain writes: I can see it to this day, that radiant panorama, that wilderness of rich color, that incomparable dissolving-view of harmonious tints and lithe half-covered forms, and beautiful brown faces, and gracious and graceful attitudes and movements, free, unstudied, barren of stiffness and restraint However, this appreciation of the beautiful brown faces (especially those of the women), is removed if the women appear to any extent European. In his account, the attitudes and movements of the locals is defined in opposition to something presumably European, stiffness and restraint.
Writers dissonance
Twains disgust at the un-exoticized native is expressed in his description of the following incident when he sees a group of local schoolgirls: Just then, into this dream of fairyland and paradise, a grating dissonance was injected. Out of a missionary school came marching, two and two, sixteen prim and pious little Christian black girls, Europeanly clotheddressed to the last detail, as they would have been dressed on a summer Sunday in an English or American village.
Here, Twains distaste for the grating dissonance between the locals in Western dress and his ideal of fairyland and paradise is made explicit. This dissonance, however, is articulated by Twain, and not the locals. The black girls cannot be clothed in the way of an American or European, is masking some inherent primitive truth. Twain exclaims in disgust that the girls clothes were unspeakably ugly!/ugly, barbarous, destitute of taste, repulsive as a shroud.
Twain might be accused of racism, but Twain was also a member of the Anti-Imperialist League, a Boston-based group of intellectuals and public activists begun in opposition to the American annexation of the Philippines. How do we square his apparent conception of locals with his anti-imperialist convictions The paradox is a vexing one, but one which is it worth calling attention to. Perhaps the lines between savior and oppressor are not so easily drawn.
A second example we might consider are the letters of the English writer Anthony Trollope. Trollope visited Ceylon in 1875 and wrote of his travels in the British magazine The Liverpool Mercury.
Writing about Peradeniya, Trollope repeats the familiar refrain that Eden was in Ceylon. He describes It is a land of loveliness, surrounded by the most perfect scenery which the mind can imagine. However, this conception of the most perfect, almost Edenic scenery does not require fully realized individuals.
In one letter, for instance, he recalls: All along the road, though we were travelling by night, we found natives awake and swarming in numbers. In all the cottages there were faint lights, and whenever we stopped there were slight, half-naked creatures looking at us. In the dark it was almost impossible to see whether these were men, women, or children These types of impressions, un-gendered, un-individuated, are all too common in travel accounts.
Habit of excerpting
A further problem with travel writing is that the descriptive portions of the texts are often only pieces of a larger whole. Our modern habit of excerpting, or taking out the loveliest portions of text leaves out the less-than-palatable portions. Both the Chilean writer Pablo Neruda and the Russian playwright Chekhov left beautiful accounts of Ceylon. But they are also accounts which contain worrying narrations of relations between local women and foreign men visiting the island.
Nerudas memoirs offers: One of [the women] told me about her visits to the chummies. Thats what they called the bungalows where young Englishmen, clerks in shops or firms, lived together in groups to save on money and food. Without a trace of cynicism in her voice, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, she told me that she had once had sex with fourteen of them. Neruda expresses his indignation and horror at this story but concludes, She was not a prostitute. No, she was just another product of colonialism, a candid and generous fruit off its tree
Anton Chekhov visited Ceylon in 1890. The visit took place on Chekhovs return from a tour of the island of Sakhalin, where a Russian prison camp was located, about which he wrote The Island of Sakhalin (1893-94). After Sakhalin, Chekhov travelled through British Hong Kong, Singapore and Ceylon. His account of Ceylon is captured in a letter addressed to a friend, Alexei Suvorin, on December 9, 1890, from Moscow. Chekhov wrote that Sakhalin was hell but Ceylon was paradise, drawing once again on the paradisiac island trope.
Womens racialized bodies are connected to Chekhovs rhetorical construction of paradise. The woman becomes racialized, reduced to her ethnic and physical features of dark eyes and Hindu ethnicity. David Spurrhas argued that the absence of individuation is a defining feature of the colonial discourse. By obscuring the woman and the landscape, and reducing her to a set of physical features, Chekhov robs the local woman of her individuation.
Needless to say, these are not the portions that are reprinted when their writing is used to demonstrate the beauty of Lanka. The lure of travel writing is understandable. It gives us prettified, descriptive prose accounts of Sri Lanka. But perhaps it is also a far warning, especially for local readers, to read against the writing, to read instead for nuance, mutability, complicated categories of localness that cannot be so easily defined, circumscribed and described. Read, but do so against the grain.

Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam appearing on behalf of the Attorney General made these remarks when the appeal petition pertaining to the SAITM issue was taken up before the Supreme Court.
On a previous occasion, a majority of a divided three-judge Supreme Court Bench granted special leave to appeal with a petition filed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) challenging the judgment of the Court of Appeal to register a student of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe provisionally as a medical practitioner in terms of Section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance.
The Supreme Court fixed the matter for argument on January 23 and 29 next year.
On a previous occasion, the Supreme Court had allowed Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) to intervene into the appeal filed by the SLMC. Through this appeal petition, the SLMC sought an order to set aside the judgment dated January 31, 2017 by the Court of Appeal.

Yan Oya Reservoir Project
Resettlement process in disarray
Resettlement of displaced people due to Yan Oya reservoir project is standstill for varied reasons, Yan Oya reservoir project land officer H. Ranasinghe said at the monthly district Agriculture Committee session.
The Yan Oya reservoir, the largest in the district, comprises a 2 1/2 Km long dam built at a cost of Rs. 36,000 million.
Nearly 2,000 farmer families need land for cultivation and housing and about 220 families lost their houses and property due to the Yan Oya project.
The Central Environment Authority has not so far granted its approval to clear jungle to settle people. Kajuwatta, Malporuwa, Issannewewa, Milewa and Omarakada were earmarked for resettlements. Representatives of the evacuated families U.B. Dasanayaka and S. Abeysinghe brought to the notice of Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake that they were not provided with drinking water, electricity, sanitation, roads and they were not allowed to clear forest for housing.
They said that resettled people were threatened by wild elephants and authorities had not taken steps to build electric fences to obstruct wild elephants from invading the resettlement areas.
They said they were not provided with alternative mud lands depriving them from their livelihoods.
Wires were fixed for domestic power supply but connections were not given to date, they said.
Schools, community centres, cemeteries and other welfare facilities were not established so far, they said.
The Chinese CAMC Engineering Company, which was entrusted to complete the work including the spill, sluice, main dam and three saddle dams, is waiting till the resettlement process is over to give the final touch to the construction work.
Filling water to the reservoir could not be carried out until the end of 2018 or beyond due to unwarranted delay in resettling evacuated families. The CAMC would ask for a huge compensation over the long delay in resettlement that prevents them from completing their contract, sources said.
Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minster Vijith Vijithamuni Soysa said the people in Yan Oya zone in the recent past saved the area from getting in to the clutches of the tiger terrorists, risking their lives and suffering untold hardships, without leaving their villages in fear.
When we implement development activities in this area, rules and regulations must be eased without comparing with other areas of the country, he said.
Unfortunately, many necessities were overlooked allowing the people to suffer without housing, land and other infra structural facilities. I am to submit a paper to get the Cabinet approval to pay each family of these innocent destitute farmer families a Rs. 8,000 monthly allowance until they were provided with alternative mud lands, Minister said.

ROBERT MUGABE RESIGNS
Robert Mugabe resigned as President of Zimbabwe Tuesday, Parliament Speaker Jacob Mudenda announced, bringing the curtain down on a 37-year reign.
Mugabe was swept from power as hisautocratic rule crumbled within days of a military takeover.
I Robert Gabriel Mugabe in terms of section 96 of the constitution of Zimbabwe hereby formally tender my resignation...
with immediate effect, said speaker Mudenda, reading the letter.
The bombshell news was delivered to a special joint session of Parliament.
Lawmakers had convened to debate a motion to impeach Mugabe, who has dominated every aspect of Zimbabwean public life since independence in 1980.
It was greeted on the streets of the capital Harare with car horns and wild cheering.
It capped an unprecedented week in which the military seized control, tens of thousands of Zimbabwean citizens took to the streets to demand the president go and 93-year-old Mugabe wrestled to remain in power.
Mugabe had ruled Zimbabwe almost unopposed since the country won independence from Britain.
But his efforts to position his wife Grace as his successor triggered fury in the military that had underpinned his regime.
Meanwhile, Impeachment proceedings against Mugabe began earlier on Tuesday as the ruling party, Zanu-PF, attempted to remove him from office.
Thousands of Zimbabweans had also turned up outside parliament to urge on MPs, chanting, dancing and waving placards in Africa Unity square
Shortly before legislators met, the man expected to succeed him broke more than a week of silence to add his voice to those calling for the ageing leader to step down.
Emmerson Mnangagwa, until recently Mugabes vice-president and right hand man, urged the nonagenarian leader to accept the will of the people.
Mugabe has been under house arrest and key allies of his wife, Grace, removed from power since the military took charge last week.
The ruling Zanu-PF party, which at the weekend voted to make Mnangagwa its leader and demote Mugabe to a rank-and-file member, introduced the motion to impeach and the opposition seconded it.

Sculpted intelligence
In oriental culture, especially in Hindu and Buddhist tradition, each direction is believed to be guarded by the guardians. Different guardians are given to different Lokas or Realms. The guardians of each Loka is called by a special terminology called Palas. According to Hinduism, each direction is allocated to one particular guardian-or deity. Each Pala has its own Loka. These guardians are called as Palas. The Palas are divided into categories. The main two categories are Dikpalas and Lokapalas.
Dikpalas mean guardians of different directions. The term Dikpalas is a Sanskirit term. The guardians are the deities who guard specific directions of space according to Hinduism. The group of eight deities is referred as Asta-Dikpalas, literally meaning guardians of eight directions. Sometimes they are often referred to additionally with two extra deities; hence altogether there are ten Dikpalas for ten different directions.
Nine directions
When altogether there are ten Dikpalas, they are called as Dasa-Dikpala. In Hinduism, these traditional images are often depicted on the walls and rooftops. In certain countries in South East Asian region like Java and Bali have altogether nine Dikpalas for nine directions. These nine Dikpalas are mentioned as Nava Dikpalas. Such faith could be seen in the Chinese faith also. According to Chinese tradition total number of Dikpalas are four, which are guarding four different directions.
Meanwhile, Lokapalas mean the guardians of a different kingdom. They are supposed to guard Nine Lokas. Altogether for nine Lokas, nine guardians are allocated. Different guardians are allocated for different directions. Kubera is the deity of Northern direction and he guards with the weapon of mace. Indra is believed to be the God of air and his direction is east. Yama is the God of South and his weapon is the staff. Varuna is the God of Water and his direction is the West. His guarding weapon is the noose. Besides Lord Brahma guards the zenith, (the highest point in the sky). Vishnu guards at Nadir the point just opposite the Zenith. His guarding weapon is chakra. The Ishana guards the northeast and his weapon is a trident. Agni guards the southeast and its weapon is spear. Vayu guards the northwest; Nirrti guards the southwest with the sword.
Temple entrance
In Buddhist tradition, the Lokpalas guardians are named as Dhrtarastra (East), Virupaksa (West) Vaisravana(North) and Virudhaka (South)l With these Lokapalas Lord Brahma and Vishnu are also included. Following this tradition, still, the Hindu religious temples install guards at the temple entrance. These Hindu temple guards are called as Duwarapalakas.
Similarly, in the Sri Lankan archaeological sites beautiful guard stones are found. The guard stones are found at the entrance of the important places such as Buddhist temples. Earlier guard stones were installed at royal palaces, important royal courts, water reservoirs and cultural chambers. In Sri Lanka, a variety of guard stones is found at different archaeological sites.
At the entrance of Hindu temples, two guards are always installed at the entrance. These guards are called either Dwarapalas or Dwarapalakas. They are always installed not only at the Hindu temple entrance but they also guard at the entrance of sanctum or sanatorium. A Pair of Dwarapalakas is installed not only as the entrance guards, but they are also regarded as servants or as warriors for protection. Normally these statues are installed as huge figures. Even in the South East Asian region at the entrance of the temples the guard figures are depicted with tuff and fearsome appearance.
Vaishnava cult
The nature and appearance of Vishnu temple Duwarapalakas are quite different from the Saiva temples. In the Vishnu temple, Duwarapalakas reflect the Vaishnava cult.
They resemble the artifacts or the symbols of Vaishnavaism. The temple guards of Vaishnava temples bear, Namam on the forehead and hold Chakara with the right upper hand and conch in the left hand. In the one lower hand the mace is held and in the other lower hand holds the noose (pasa cord, the coil of rope). In the Sakthism division in Hinduism which is strongly connected with Sakthi worship (Kaali worship). At the entrance of the Satkhi temples, two female guards are guarding the temples. These female guards are called Duwarapalakis. In certain Skanda temples, two Idumpan guards are installed to guard them at the outside temple entrance
Installing Duwrapalaka statues at the entrance of Hindu temples came into being following the ancient tradition of installing of Lokpalas and Dikpalas. A lot of bronze Dikpalas and Lokpalas sculptures are excavated from the Polonnaruwa area. Now all these sculptures are well preserved, housed and displayed in numerous different museums of Sri Lanka, especially in Colombo and Polonnaruva.

Senerath can't be charged under Public Property Act: Magistrate
Former Presidents Chief of Staff, Gamini Sedara Senarath and two officials were yesterday ordered to be released on bail by the Colombo Fort Magistrate.
The Magistrate observed that the suspects cannot be charged under the Public Property Act.
They are charged for allegedly misusing public funds by illegally investing Rs.4 billion from the Rs.18.5 billion approved by the Cabinet for a hotel project in 2012.
The three suspects, Gamini Senarath, former Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Managing Director Piyadasa Kudabalage and former Samurdhi Commissioner Neil Bandara Hapuwinna were released on a cash bail of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of one million rupees each by Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
The Magistrate further observed that so far there is no sufficient facts brought before court to institute criminal charges against the three suspects. The first and second suspects were barred from leaving the country.
In her bail order, the Magistrate maintained that Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation is a company registered under the Company Act and thereby it does not come under the Public Property Act. However, the Magistrate observed that there is no obstacle for the Attorney General to initiate legal action against the suspects following the conclusion of investigations.
According to a B report filed before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court, they have been accused of misusing government funds by illegally investing Rs.4 billion from the Rs.18.5 billion approved by the Cabinet in 2012.
The funds in question had been the allocated for the Kollupitiya Grand Hyatt Regency Hotel, to be constructed by Canwill Holdings, a company affiliated to Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, but had been invested in the Hambantota Hyatt Regency Hotel project.
It is revealed that Canwill Holdings formed two subsidiaries, Sinolanka Hotel and Spa, which was implementing the Hyatt hotel project in Kollupitiya and Helanco Hotels and Spa to carry out the proposed Hyatt hotel in Hambantota.
The reconstruction work of the partly build Celestial Residencies building of the failed Ceylinco Group was then transformed, during the past three years, to build the Hyatt hotel in Colombo. The land was leased for 99 years from the Urban Development Authority (UDA) after the former Ceylinco property was expropriated by the previous government in 2011, in terms of the provisions in the Revival of Underperforming Enterprises and Underutilised Assets Act No.43 of 2011.
The prosecution maintained that the Canwill Holdings Ltd is a state-owned public enterprise, set up during former regime, with Rs. 18.5 billion in equity, secured from its major shareholders, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, which has invested Rs. 8.5 billion, and Litro Gas and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) with Rs. 5 billion each.
On November 9, the three suspects appeared before Court as per an undertaking given to the Supreme Court. However, at that time, the defence counsel appearing on behalf of the suspects told Court that their clients were not surrendering to Court, but merely appearing for the purpose of making a statement to the FCID.
Senarath and two others had filed three Fundamental Rights petitions in the Supreme Court seeking an order preventing the FCID from arresting them in connection with a magisterial inquiry, under the Public Property Act and Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
This petition is to be taken up for support on November 24.
Presidents Counsel Ali Sabry with Anil Silva PC, Sampath Mendis and Counsel Nalinda Indatissa appeared for the suspects. Chief Inspector Anura Premaratne appeared for the FCID.

Sharapova named in India luxury housing fraud probe
New Delhi: Five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova is under investigation by Indian police for cheating and criminal conspiracy after the collapse of a luxury housing project that she endorsed, a lawyer said Tuesday.
The firm behind the development is alleged to have taken millions of dollars from homebuyers before the project folded.
Piyush Singh, a lawyer representing one of the buyers, told AFP that police had filed initial charges of cheating and criminal conspiracy against Sharapova as part of a wider case against the firm Homestead Infrastructure Development.
The 30-year-old tennis star travelled to India in 2012 to launch the luxury high-rise apartment complex -- named Ballet by Sharapova -- which prospective buyers were told would house a tennis academy, a clubhouse and a helipad. The website of the project quotes Sharapova as saying her goal was to make the owners feel like they own something special and different.
Any celebrity who endorses any product technically becomes an agent for that company. No one would have invested in the project if Sharapovas name was not there, said Singh.
The project in Gurgaon -- a satellite city of the capital New Delhi -- was supposed to be ready in 2016 but, Singh said, construction work was abandoned after builders collected millions from homebuyers.
Police were not immediately available for comment on the case, which is being heard in a Delhi court. Calls to the developers also went unanswered. Sharapova has not commented on the case. AFP

Art, culture play pioneering  role in transforming societies
The Citizen's Media Movement should demonstrate that integrated living is how good governance will be sustained and ingrained in citizens, National Arts and Cultural Policy of Sri Lanka Chairman, Dr. Sunil Wijesiriwardena said.
Integrated living is possible through citizens who are culturally integrated with themselves, with other communities, with the past, the present and with the rest of the world, he said.
Dr. Wijesiriwardena said to bring about a real change in society, there is a need to restructure the ways in which art, religion and education is pursued.
Delivering the key note speech at the 25th anniversary of the Free Media Movement (FMM) at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute yesterday, Dr. Wijesiriwardena said renaissance was all about restructuring art, religion and education. FMM organised a "National Summit on Free Media Culture with social responsibility" with the participation of print, electronic, online media personnel, activists, policy decision makers, academics, intellectuals and civil society organizations.
He noted that a study of world history and the renaissance movements that ushered the communities from darkness to light, highlight the particular ability of art and culture, to play a pioneering role in healing and transforming societies.
Explaining the central role of media in our daily lives and the changing media environment of the past decades, he said that the media environment has changed since the inception of the Free Media Movement.
He added that journalists are a group of people who are targeted for expressing their thoughts and views.He questioned whether the journalists have got the freedom they anticipated 25 years back.
According to Dr. Wijesiriwardena, people fail to see the details of the issues and questioned when there are no good people in a country how it is possible to implement good governance.
He said that during the past 60 years, as a nation, we have only thought of legal reforms, political reforms and economic development.
He added that we have never thought about cultural renewal- that is to transform the society, change social values and collective consciousness but changing the consciousness was not possible thorough legal, political or economic reforms.
He questioned whether all our teachers, doctors, artists, students, Journalists and politicians are real and doing their job as expected.
Dr Wijesiriwardena said that we are still unable to arrive at a justifiable answer.
He said that these issues cannot be solved by changing the constitution or the structure of an institution. "However, it has to be acknowledged that state governance has not been able to do enough, nor has it done the right thing to nourish a healthy living culture among the citizens of this country," he said.
He further said that expectation of a youth today is for a luxurious life, good transportation and other material needs.There is a void in communication between one person to another and added that they need to learn how to engage with family, nature and with themselves, he said.
He said that teachers, artists, religious leaders and journalists have a huge responsibility in bringing a change in the society and added that they should know to maintain their professionalism.

Constitution requires immediate reforms
Momentum will be lost if a referendum on reforms to the constitution is not held within the next three months, said Verite Research, Head of Media Research Deepanjali Abeywardena, presenting the sentiments shown by the press on the ongoing constitutional reform process.
The presentation was made at a discussion on the constitutional Reforms and Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly, organized jointly by Internews and the Law and Society Trust, which was held at the auditorium of the International Centre for Ethnic Studies recently.
Member of Parliament and member of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly of Sri Lanka Dr. Jayampathy Wickremarathne, Law and Society Trust Director Dinushika Dissanayaike, Internews Director Sam de Silva and a select gathering including journalists were invited for the discussion.
Most discussions in the press have taken place on the themes Unitary and United, Supremacy of Buddhism, and Federalism and Separatism from time to time, but subsequent to the release of the interim report of the steering committee on September 21, 2017, all three themes have been discussed simultaneously, said Abeywardena.
From March to August, 2017, the content of the Sinhala press was 46 percent positive, while the content of the English Press was only 42 percent positive. The Tamil Press has been Neutral 49 percent to be exact on what they carried with respect to the constitutional reform process. Among the television channels we monitored, the most negative coverage was by Derana Aruna, she said.
The Joint Opposition dominated the discussion on constitutional reform process until the Interim Report was released in late September, after which the other political parties joined the discussions. At present the most vociferous are the Buddhist clergy. But once again, the Buddhist clergy is also divided in opinion. The voice of the clergy can change the press sentiment to a great extent, she added.
Up to now, it has been the government that defended accusations made by the Joint Opposition, but now we see former president Mahinda Rajapaksa coming forward to defend actions taken during his tenure with the entrance of two new themes of discussion, namely the Executive Presidency and the 13th amendment. All this time, while the UNP has been defending the reforms, the SLFP has not come out to take ownership, but have only come forward to rectify inadequacies.
It is time that the UNP and SLFP jointly answer the undermentioned doubts raised over: Abolishing the Executive Presidency will result in instability, the government lacks a mandate to amend the constitution, NGOs are behind the draft reforms, reforms will compromise the Unitary State and lead to a Federal State, Buddhism will lose its primacy of place, the new constitution is already drafted and What is the need of a new constitution, she added.

Those involved in corruption, fraud will be exposed - State Minister
Science, Technology and Research State Minister Lakshman Seneviratne said it was due to the intervention of President Maithripala Sirisena that many fraudulent and corrupt practices were exposed to society.
We all must appreciate his great effort, he added.
However, we believe that all the Bond deals made during the former regime should also be investigated as some information with regard to the direct involvement of certain members of the previous government has already been revealed, Seneviratne said.
State Minister Seneviratne said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has set an example to others by appearing before the Presidential Commissions investigating the Bond issue. We must appreciate the Prime Ministers actions.
When Former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran was questioned by the COPE, it was proved that there was a bond issue, State Minister Seneviratne said.
The COPE report also stated clearly that there was a irregularity in the Bond deal. It was the appeal by COPE members and the public that President Maithripala Sirisena appointed the Presidential Commission to probe Central Bank Bond issue, he said.
However,if the MPs in the COPE have spoken to officials of Perpetual Treasuries, while the COPE proceedings were on, it is a very serious matter.These members should be ashamed of being Members of Parliament, the State Minister added.
Commenting on the Local Government election, the State Minister said since the united approach by both factions of the SLFP will result in a SLFP victory at the forthcoming Local Government polls, certain elements want to sabotage that paving the way for a UNP victory, Seneviratne said.
The SLFP was of the view of that the Local Government election should be held. We have already selected the best candidates throughout the country who can give strong leadership to develop their villages.
If the SLFP is divided, it will destroy the party. That has been proven through past experiences. When we are divided, we end up in the Opposition for many years. The UNP suffered the same for 20 years, he said.
If both SLFP factions stay united, our victory is guaranteed. Otherwise, we will end up as the losers at the forthcoming election causing much disappointment to our supporters. If former President Mahinda Rajapaksa insists on contesting from the Pohottuwa, he will have to bear the responsibility for the SLFPs defeat.

As FFSL, we want to use opportunities like this to interact with European based clubs and other organizations with a view to support football in Sri Lanka in terms of development programs and exposure.
We are delighted about this opportunity as there are many former professional players accompanying this team. Football without Borders team will also be engaged in a few charity related activities during the tour, extending their engagement in Sri Lanka beyond football, said FFSL president Anura de Silva.
The team will be touring across the country with friendly matches being organized in Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Gampola, Nuwara Eliya and Matara. The Swiss team comprises of 25 members with 16-player team captained by Gianni DAgostino and a staff team of 8.
The goal of Football Without Borders is to narrow the borders among nations through sport by continuing to develop football in countries with lesser resources and equip teams with the basic requirements such as footballs, jerseys, pants and socks. In the process, they wish to make awareness about culture, geography, people and allow a mutual insight into the teams culture as well. Through synergies with relief organizations and football clubs, they also strive for sustainable cooperation.
Emil Franklin Kronemberg, Chairman of ECD Holidays partnered FFSL for the Swiss teams visit in Sri Lanka said that his team of holiday specialists are excited to be a part of this great tour.

Future of Sri Lanka is its youth
The future of Sri Lanka is its youth, and that future depends on access to a quality education in a safe and nurturing environment, said United States Embassy, Chief of Mission Robert Hilton at the opening of a US funded refurbishment of a school in Batticaloa.
Originally built in 1976, this all-girls school was selected by the US Pacific Command (PACOM) for upgrades on recommendations from the Sri Lankan Eastern Province Ministry of Education and the Disaster Management Centre. The U.S. Government and the Sri Lankan Ministry of Education have invested 95 million rupees (approx. $624,750) to build this three-story addition to the school. This addition means that another 480 students will have the opportunity to pursue their education.
The new addition offers a safe environment for students to explore new concepts and challenge old notions. The windows provide students a view of different landscapes of ideas, while the doors open to new opportunities. This is what a school represents: a chance for Sri Lankas youth to learn, to examine, to challenge. It is especially important to offer these opportunities to young women and girls.
The education of women has historically been overlooked in many societies, including my own. Im pleased we can provide this assistance to the future female leaders of Sri Lanka, Hilton said.
We are standing in a densely populated area that is unfortunately vulnerable to natural disasters. Because of this, we have worked with the Disaster Management Center to construct a building that can serve as an emergency shelter for the local population in times of need. The kitchen can prepare 500 meals a day and the new 35,000-liter water catchment system and 2,000 and 500 liter water tanks will ensure safe drinking water for anyone who shelters here.
Over the past four years, PACOM and the Embassy have worked closely with the Eastern Province Ministry of Education and the Disaster Management Center on the school.
I would like to thank them for their support and cooperation throughout this project, and also thank the school principal, H.M. Mansour, and our partners at Magbool Engineering Consultants and Hairu Engineering Consultancy (Pvt.) Limited.I also want to recognise the U.S Army Corps of Engineers for their essential contributions and thank Richard Stanlee and the Pacific Command/US Embassy Civil Military Support Element. They made it all possible, he said.

Timeless appeal
There are two reasons you should buy a ticket for Timeless Classics. You will be able to enjoy an unforgettable evening of music by an amazing line up of talent including Soundarie David, and Shehara (Shey) Liyanage. And you will have the opportunity to make a difference in this world. Your compassionate act will do a lot of good to a lot of people.
Timeless Classics, is a concert to raise funds toward two of the Rotary Club of Colombo Easts anchor projects namely, Project BEAPAccident and Emergency Trauma Unit Centre at the Teaching Hospital in Batticaloa, and the eradication of dengue which has been a terrible scourge.
The Rotary Club of Colombo East is proud to partner with Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo for this worthy cause.
The musical show is directed at raising finances to support the National Trauma Service in Sri Lanka, in partnership with the Ministry of Health and also to purchase an Ultrasound machine for the Batticoloa Teaching Hospital. All funds remaining will benefit the Dengue Eradication Program, commissioned in conjunction with the Ministry of Health.
Daily News speaks to Soundarie David about this unforgettable night.
Working towards a performance is always an exciting and challenging experience, and that is what I like the most when preparing for a show. Further working with talented Shehara, who I have known for years, both from her days in the HFC school choir, to now  in Soul Sounds - has always been a creative experience. Music is personal to me, so this concert like all other concerts is special. What is interesting is the fact that it will showcase some of the well- known Timeless Classics through the ages. Further, my original works will be featured as part of the performances, and I am privileged to work alongside some great musicians for this. The well- known Jerome De Silva will be a Guest Artist at this show. Jerome being the theatre person he is, has always brought in something new, fresh and dynamic to any show, and I look forward to this component of the show as well, said David.
Certainly the combination of talent promises a mesmerizing evening. Soundarie will be collaborating with Shehara on the piano. The songs are Timeless Classics.
Young or old, the audience is bound to have a favorite from their repertoire list. From the likes of Nat King Cole, to Whitney Housten, to Adele, it has a local twist to it. Also what is special is the unique arrangements to each and every song. You need to be at the concert to experience this.
For Soundarie working with Shehara has also been a rewarding experience, watching Shehara grow in voice and personality. Shehara is a talented singer and performer and this collaboration is eagerly anticipated by both women.
We started raising funds for the BEAP project as early as March 2017, where we did a similar concert in order to raise funds in Melbourne, Australia.
This concert was a success  both in terms of fund raising as well as the concert, which was well received.
Hence we decided to do something similar in Colombo, to not only give our local audiences a treat in terms of the whole concert experience, at a brand new venue, but also a chance to contribute to a good cause. So by coming to this concert and buying a ticket for it, you will definitely be making an impact in helping someone, explained David.
For a concert with a difference, for a good cause, Timeless Classics is where you need to be on November 26 at 5 pm. It is bound to be something special.
Yes, Shangri- La is a new venue, and having gone to the site for initial meetings, I can guarantee that it will be something grand, unique and special. The entire concert has also been conceptualized by our talented production team to go with the theme and venue. So it is going to be spectacular, pointed out David. David stressed that the concert will be refreshingly different while still being one of high quality. It will have the stamp of musical genius. It will live up to the expectations of the crowd, maybe even more! It will be an umbrella of music covering a wide variety of songs. It will be refreshing.
I anticipate an audience of music lovers, and not just specific to any genre of music, because like I mentioned this concert will cater for all.
So we invite all those who want an evening of good music with a difference, difference in terms of the type of repertoire, the type of arrangements, the ambiance, the show and of course added to this, the unique talented voice of Shehara, the unmistakable Jerome De Silva, and Soul with unique original music, added David.
David remarked that rehearsals are going well, it is fun and challenging, because they are always trying to create something new. Davids debut at Shangri-La makes this performance special. Timeless Classics will take place at the Shangri-La Ballroom, and as the largest ballroom in the city, this is the ideal venue for an event of this nature.
The night will truly be one to remember  an unforgettable night. Every concert, every experience, and every challenge that is thrown my way, is something that I am thankful to god for. So I look forward to the experience, the concert, and will cherish the memories, said David.

Govt. allocated Rs. 1,000 million for railways
The government has allocated Rs. 1,000 million for the refurbishment of 25 railway stations in the 2018 Budget, said Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
Speaking at a ceremony held in Kurunegala on Monday, 20, to open a 75 m new fifth platform at the Kurunegala Railway Station, the minister explained that the current government has given prominence to improving public transport.
Special focus has been given to railways. Of the total passenger numbers in the country, only 42 percent uses the railway. Railways are being run at a loss today, but it is a public service, and as such, we will take it forward for the public's benefit, he said.
This railway station had only four platforms, but with the fifth addition, it will be easier for the passengers. The railway department has spent Rs. 75 million on this. But simply upgrading railway buildings alone will not be sufficient; passengers who come here should be given good service, added the minister.
Since taking over, the minister pointed out that the Railways had hired 250 station masters and it was done without any political influence. He insisted that he had not provided his supporters jobs in the railway.
The main problem we face within the Department is the trade union mafia. Due to the power struggles among trade unions, there is, to a certain extent, a breakdown in the railway service. Our trade unions resort to strikes even for the slightest problem. If for one year, we abandon such trade union action and come together to work for the benefit of the railway, we will definitely be able to improve it, said de Silva.

Over 1,500 families in Ratnapura need land
We need to provide alternative land for 1,676 families in Ratnapura and 215 acres were already identified for the purpose. We cannot easily take over land owned by plantation companies. We have to follow a certain procedure. The government will take every step possible to provide relief to the affected people, Ratnapura District Secretary Malani Lokupothgama said.
She was speaking at an awareness programme conducted at the Ratnapura Weralupa, Diamond Restaurant on Monday (20) for the media on the disaster management mechanism and the need to prepare for challenges posed by climate change.
Many ask for land in the medium risk areas. We need to make people get used to living with disasters. Otherwise, we will have to evacuate the whole of Ratnapura, Lokupothagama said.
She said it was necessary to have trained volunteer organisations at the village level to mobilise people at times of disaster to minimise harm.
The damage caused to houses, buildings and roads with the recent floods and landslides cost Rs. 17,200 million to the government. Lokupothgama said Rs. 1,376 million was allocated to rehabilitate 312 roads and to reconstruct 79 schools and the work on them were in progress. She said canals and waterways should not be blocked when constructing houses and the relevant government institutions should not give permission for such construction.
If everyone fulfilled their responsibilities, we would not have such problems. People implement their plans on holidays thinking that there are no government officers to stop them, she said.
Certain people provoked the displaced due to floods and landslides saying that the government was unable to provide them with land. But as government officials, we have certain procedures to follow, she said.
Ratnapura District Disaster Management Centre Assistant Director Muditha Manjula, District Coordinating Officer Hemantha Abeywardena, National Building and Research Organization Director Abeetha Wanasundara, officials and journalists participated.

Ranjit Jinasena Memorial Autocross, a boost for grass root level
The Ceylon Motor Sports Club (CMSC), Sri Lankas oldest club involved in motor sport, come out once again to refresh the memories of many a stalwart in Motor Sport who knew the great Motor Racing Legend, Ranjit Jinasena, by conducting a
Members and Friends Autocross at the Jinasena Estate in Katana Negombo.
Ranjit to his piers, and uncle Ranjit to many of us, as he was fondly remembered knew him to be involved in many a pioneering events, that catered to grassroots level motor sport being enjoyed by novice drivers and riders.
Ranjit was the president of the CMSC, at the time of his passing away and his fervent wish was that he wanted to see young drivers come into the sport and for experienced drivers to represent Sri Lanka Overseas.
Having remembered his wishes, the CMSC, is organizing a 1.2km sprint type Autocross, which will bring back many memories of the past.
The CMSC is gearing this event, to suit the novice drivers in different classes, and invite competitors to bring their road going cars and take part in this type of event, which has been the birthplace of many a star today.
An Autocross is where a competitor drives on a demarcated route, which is within a private coconut estate, while the route is outlined by marker tapes. The competitor may for his ease have a navigator, which is not compulsory. Two runs will be given and the best cumulative time achieved will be classed as the winner. This is not a mass start type of event and each competitor will be timed alone.
All proceeds of this event will be in aid of RTJs favorite charity, the Deaf and Blind School  Ratmalana where Nilanthi Jinasena still officiates as a trustee.
The President and his committee wish to invite all well wishes from yesterday who knew RTJ as well as new drivers who wish to have a Sunday out and experience the art of motor sport in your home car to come and try this event.

Some employing delaying tactics regarding elections
The Collective of Election Monitoring Organizations yesterday charged that the writ petition filed by six electors challenging the legality of the Gazette notification on Local Government delimitations is also a part of the governments agenda in postponing elections.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Centre for Society and Religion in Maradana, PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said a politically motivated group of six people from different districts had gone to the Court of Appeal and are challenging the delimitation report.
He questioned whether these people give their opinions during the delimitation process, adding that the committee went around the country to obtain peoples views.
He further said the committee has issued its report nine months ago. But none of these individuals had given opinions to the delimitation committee.
Therefore, it is clear why they are challenging the delimitation report at this time, he said.
The Elections Commission clearly stated that they are going to hold elections in January. That is why this politically motivated group filed a petition with the intention of delaying elections. All political parties, including the UNP, SLFP and JVP claim that they are not opposed to holding elections.
We respect these individuals right to file a petition if they are attempting to seek justice and we are ready to take their side if they are being discriminated, Hettiarachchi said.
Addressing the gathering, CaFFE Executive Director Keerthi Thennakoon alleged that the five individuals who filed the petition had close connections with some powerful SLFPers and the Local Government Minister is also making various attempts to postpone elections.
This petition is scheduled to take up for hearing at the Court of Appeal today.

Warner hit by neck injury ahead of Ashes
Brisbane: Australia vice-captain David Warner said he will undergo intense treatment on his neck after suffering sudden pain during training on Tuesday, just two days before the first Ashes Test in Brisbane.
The opening batsman injured his neck while taking a high catch on the Gabba outfield, and later left for the dressing room to get treatment.
"My neck is quite stiff," Warner told reporters. "I took a high ball and something just twinged in my neck. I haven't really had a stiff neck like this one before."
The 31-year-old said he was hopeful his neck would "settle down in the next 24 to 48 hours", adding: "I don't think a sore neck is going to keep me out."
"I'll try and have a hit tomorrow at some stage. I have to work on my technique a little bit more, probably facing up," he said."I'll get some more treatment tonight, get some heat packs, get some fingers into it and hopefully it's better tomorrow."
Warner added that he left the net session later on, as the neck issue meant he was not able to take his usual stance.
"If I can't be face-on, there was no point in hitting because I can't angle myself," he added. "That's not how I want to train."
Warner is a key member of Australia's Ashes team and averaging almost 60 at home.
He is due to open with debutant Cameron Bancroft.AFP

Airtel empower customers to shop on  Google Play using mobile balance
For the first time in Sri Lanka customers will be able to purchase apps and other digital content through their Airtel recharges or reloads on Google Play. This Direct Carrier Billing (DCB) service will permit prepaid customers to have their purchases deducted from their remaining balances, while postpaid customers will have their purchases incurred to their monthly phone bill. 
Given that the circulation of credit cards is still considerably low, especially among the youth of Sri Lanka. Airtel's recent collaboration with Google Play will introduce a great alternative to online purchases for those who currently do not have a credit or a debit card.
Airtel customers will be the first to be able to purchase digital content from the comfort of their smartphones, reaping the benefits of Airtel's 40% faster internet and Google Play security.
Airtel customers will now have access to millions of paid apps on Google Play store, including new movies, music, educational content and games.
Although a lot of people are online, their ability to transact has been limited because of the requirement to own a credit card. This alliance will give our customers the ability to do so in a convenient and safe manner. said Jinesh Hegde, CEO and MD at Bharti Airtel Lanka. This is a highly customizable payment solution that gives digital merchants and app stores direct access to mobile operators wallet
Customers can easily activate DCB on their android handsets by adding Use Airtel Billing in the payment methods of their Google Play account menu.

Yal Devi collides with two lorries
The Yal Devi Express met with an accident with two lorries at the Hunupitiya railway crossing in Wattala, causing major delays on the Colombo-Kandy main line, yesterday.
The drivers of the two lorries had managed to escape unhurt.
The accident which occurred at 6.05 am had occurred when a dilapidated vehicle traveling in front of these two lorries had broke down in front of them. Thereafter, a van transporting schoolchildren had, against traffic rules, overtaken the lorries to bypass the broken down vehicle. This has caused the lorries to get stuck on the crossing.
A rail guard had been present at the crossing, but according to witnesses, he was busy on the telephone when the lorries got stuck on the crossing.
They added that he had not taken any steps to prevent the accident. Neighbours, the lorry drivers and witnesses state that if the guard had paid more attention, the accident could have been prevented.
The accident led to delays in the two railway lines at the crossing with the Yal Devi itself being delayed until 8.30, inconveniencing many office workers and schoolchildren.
The commuters, as well as area residents asked that the minister ban the use of telephones by rail guards while they're at work. The Kiribathgoda Police Motor traffic Unit is conducting further investigations into the accident.

Basils request in almanac case fixed for Nov. 24
The Court of Appeal yesterday reserved its order for November 24 to decide whether to issue an order staying proceedings into the controversial almanac case.
The case is heard before Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga. The Court of Appeal bench comprises Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya (President) and Justice Shiran Gunaratne.
Filing a Transfer Application in the Court of Appeal, former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa has sought an order staying any further proceedings into the controversial almanac case heard before Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga, currently presiding over Court No.6 of Colombo High Court.
Rajapaksa has sought an order transferring the case from Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga to any other court of High Court of Colombo.
Judge Kulatunga also delivered the judgment regarding the Controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case. Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to TRC.
In his petition, Basil Rajapaksa stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC) which initiated an inquiry against him.

BOI targets US$ 1.5 bn FDI for 2017
Sri Lanka would target over US$ 1.5 billion foreign direct investments (FDI) for 2017, said Chairman Board of Investment Dumindra Ratnayake.
We are targeting US$ 5 billion by 2020. The total FDI in 2016 was US$ 801 million.
Addressing on breakfast meeting in Colombo yesterday he said that after a drop in FDI there has been a pickup in 2017.
He said that in the first quarter of 2017 the country attracted US$ 216 million and it increased to US$ 332 million in the second quarter. The third quarter FDI inflows were US$ 443 million.
He said that they are also expecting a mega Japanese investment which would be over Rs. 1 billion and also several other projects.
He also said that they will only look at ethical and environmental friendly projects and would not approve unethical projects.
There was a recycle project for scrap metal for a sizable investment but we did not approve it since we found that the local value additional was minimal and it has environmental issues as well.
Ratnayake said that since taking over last January several prudent measures were taken to iron out and clear bottle necks.
He said that there is still an issue at rural level when executing BOI projects due to red tape at pradeshiya saba level. We are addressing these issues. He also said that the present 12 BOI zones are now almost 95% occupied and if a big investor comes the BOI do not have any land to offer to them.
No new zones have being created since 2012 and due to this we are now looking at creating new zones.
This is why we are now going ahead with the creating of the Rojana Zone in Horana which would be PPP project with a Thailand base company.
He also said that in the last six years more attention had been given to infrastructure related FDI which was over 60%.
I think that this should be 40% and 60% of FDI should be from the manufacturing. This situation is now shifting in the right direction.
He said that the Biyagama Zone is today having an issue with regard to water.
This is because when the zone was planned they did not take in to account the township and the population growth in the area. We are now going recycle water from the zone to be reused in the zone.

## Date: Wednesday, November 22, 2017 - 01:00
Suntharalingam from Vavuniya fought for Indian Tamils in Central Hills
Brief tenure of a cultured statesman
Chellappah Suntharalingam was born on August 19, 1895. He was an academic, mathematician, politician, lawyer, Member of Parliament and government minister.
Educated at St. John's College, Jaffna and St. Joseph's College, Colombo, he entered the London University from where he graduated in mathematics. He then went on to Oxford for a double first in mathematics.
Suntharalingam had four eminent siblings: C. Nagalingam, a Supreme Court judge; C. Panchalingam, a medical doctor; C. Amirthalingam Director of Fisheries; and C. Thiagalingam also a leading lawyer.
Ending his academic and legal carrier, Suntharalingam became interested in politics in 1940. He contested two by-elections to enter the State Council in 1943 and 1944 but was unsuccessful. In 1947, as an independent candidate contesting Vavuniya he won and entered Parliament. At the invitation of D S Senanayake he joined the United National Party led government and in September 1947, he became the Minister of Trade and Commerce in it.
The Prime Minster introduced the infamous Ceylon Citizenship Act a year later which deprived the Indian Tamils their citizenship rights under Indian and Pakistani Residents Citizenship Bill. They who comprised five percent of the nation's population were left stateless and disenfranchised.
When the second reading division was called, Suntharalingam walked out of Parliament in protest. Instead of answering a call for explanation he resigned from the Cabinet to become a champion for the rights of Indian Tamils in the plantations. He declared that if the Buddha were to come to Sri Lanka today, He himself would be disfranchised and deported.
Use of Sinhala only policy
Suntharalingams most vital role in politics; his clear and serious role as a public personality engaged in pursuit for justice and fair play; he comes into eminence with the involvement of the Indian Residents Citizenship issue. The plantation labour had made Sri Lanka their home for two centuries, and contributed hugely to build the nation's economy. Other top Tamil politicians from Jaffna, like GG Ponnambalam supported Governments move. Suntharaligam frankly stood up for fair and cultured treatment of residents who had been brought in early 18/19th Century to build the wealth of this nation.
As an Independent Member of Parliament for Vavuniya, the former Cabinet Minister, C. Suntharalingam proposed an amendment to the Throne Speech of SWRD on June 24, 1956 voicing grave displeasure with new governments policy on the use of Sinhala Only for governmental purposes and in higher education.
He said, it would lead to a demand for the creation of a separate autonomous state of Tamil Ilankai composed of all Tamil speaking peoples in the island. He stressed that if the disturbing amendments to language use did not please Tamils, they would insist in a separate State.
Participating in a Parliamentary debate he said, one time the Prime Minister of Ceylon had most diabolically disfranchised the Indian Labour population, without whose efforts the government could not run a single day. If they organised a hartal, the government would be on its knees in a fortnight.
During Bandaranaike rule in late fifties, speaking in the House he referred to those freedoms under that government, he wanted them to consider one simple example under the freedom of association.
Whatever might be the views of the UNP, they had the right to march to Kandy. But the hoodlums of the government had obstructed them; the Police had looked on, and had banned the march.
Would such a thing have happened under the Brithish rule Make no mistakes, we have not exchanged British rule, for Sinhala rule, or British imperialism for Sinhala Socialism.
At no time we have succumbed to a foreigner, or have we betrayed our people as Ehelepola did in 1815.
We will go down only fighting, we will lose our rights only on the battlefield, he declared. DS knew and appreciated what democracy was and lived up to it; not like cut-throats we have now, who keep changing their minds. DS did not do anything without first consulting me.
Philip Gunawardene -: Awissawella:- that was his blunder.
C Sunderalingham -: Some blunder resulted in the member for Awissawella occupying a ministerial seat. Unwillingly I made that mistake. Forgive me. Do you hold the same view of independence today, as you held at the Independence Day meeting when you addressed it
Philip Gunawardene:- Yes of course.
C Sunderalingham:- I thought he was a fine and sincere revolutionary. He is the most dangerous kuthu karanam politician of the worst type.
Interruption:- what about you
C Sunderalingham:- I challenge any one to point out one single matter in which I committed kuthu karanam, I have not done so, because I study every matter and discuss it fully before I make up my mind on it. And once I made up my mind no one can make me change it. - Hansard - Nov. 7, 1957.
Professor of Mathematics
Suntharalingam became an outstandingly brilliant intellectual who decorated the chair as Professor of Mathematics.
Suntharaligam renounced the routine duty of the civil service, however superior it was and instead chose the relatively more challenging duties and demanding responsibilities as a higher university don.
The Professor was quite compassionate to undergraduates whose shortcoming he endured in a broad minded way. A celebrated and respected scholar and accessible counsellor, he was truthful and never faltered to promote the cause of students against British trained stern authoritarians who headed these establishments of higher learning.
Suntharalingam protested against the adoption of the national flag; in fact he resigned his seat in Parliament too in 1951. However, he won the bye-election comfortably bringing him back to Parliament. He won again at the 1952 parliamentary election. Suntharalingam strongly opposed the attempts to make Sinhala the sole official language.
All Ceylon Tamil Congress candidate T. Sivasithamparam defeated Suntharalingam, the independent candidate at the parliamentary election in 1965; which was repeated in1970 by Federal party candidate and leader S. J. V. Chelvanayakam when he contested Kankesanthurai seat as an independent. Suntharalingam spent his retirement in home town Vavuniya until his death in February 1985.
He formed a singular Tamil movement called, Tamils who would not be subjugated Front, calling for equality with majority in treatment in a multiracial nation in every respect. Failure to meet his reasonable demands resulted in so much chaos and disorder to Sri Lanka and its people.
Most countries have only few honest politicians and this is just like having a body with only few good organs functioning!

Calls for CoI to probe 'Commonwealth Games' spending
A commission should be appointed to investigate as to how a private company spent Rs. 200 million state funds for the Commonwealth Games, State Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim said.
Flashback: MP Namal Rajapaksa and then Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage explaining the proposed Commonwealth Village to an official ahead of the costly bid to host the event.
The Minister said this in response to a question posed by JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa in Parliament yesterday.
He said there is no account called Commonwealth Games and it is necessary to inquire into this issue.
However, there was a current account that was operated as C.W.G. Hambantota 2018 (Pvt) Ltd., and Rs.11 million was invested in a fixed deposit. The minister said state funds and donations were deposited in the above mentioned account.
State funds amounting to Rs.190,387 million had been deposited in this account. It was difficult to obtain details of this account from the bank. This money had been used on foreign trips and safaris, Minister Hashim said.

Calm against the chaos: Mahanama College
A leader himself, Head Prefect of Mahanama Shehan Dhananjaya is the man any leader wanted in his team. He is the kind of man any general would want in his battalion. Dhananajaya possesses certain qualities that are needed for a man or a team to succeed. Perfect Prefects features Dhananjaya who aims to be an officer and gentlemen.
His dream is to become a senior officer in the Sri Lankan Navy and start an orphanage and an elders home. Dhananjaya is inspired by the former American President Abraham Lincoln with whom he has much in common. According to Dhananjaya, Lincoln had that all important quality - to control ones emotions. He listened to everyone and had the ability to communicate his goals and visions. A man whose principals were like a rock, Lincoln is regarded as one of the greatest Presidents not only in America but in the world.
Openness and Conscientiousness
Dhananjaya is the kind of man who has admired whether his team is successful or has been defeated.
The personality traits in me are Openness and Conscientiousness. I feel that I am open to change. I am a creative thinker and always looking to innovate. I am conscientious. I am also a person who is able to form warm and productive relationships in life, said Dhananjaya.
In life sometimes we fear things when there is no reason to fear. We create imaginary problems. Dhananjaya has his own scheme. The question that is foremost on his mind is - is there really a problem here How many of us worry endlessly How many of us struggle with non -existent problems Often we create problems in our own heads, that arent really out there in reality. So you need to relax a bit. And then you need to question yourself as to whether this is a really big problem. Life becomes so less stressful when you stop making a mountain out of a molehill.
When you accept that the problem already exists, and stop resisting, then you also stop putting more energy into the problem and stop feeding it. Now it just exists (well, more or less, you might still feel a bit down about it). You can use the energy you previously used to feed the problem with  the energy that probably made the problem look bigger than it was to find creative solutions to the problem, said Dhananjaya.
Positive mindset
You dont need to be alone in life. Others have faced similar problems to yours. Sometimes having someone to talk to does wonders. There is an old saying  There will always be help for those who ask for it. Dhananjaya also believes that a positive mindset is a key to overcoming a problem.
Use 80 percent of your time to find solutions. And only 20 percent to complain, worry and whine. It might not always be easy but focusing your energy, time and thoughts in this way is much more beneficial for you and others than doing the opposite, pointed out Dhananjaya
Dhananjaya would certainly make a fine officer. He has such an organized mind. A mind that has been trained to address all forms of problems and how to solve them. It is actually the trait of a very competent leader.
When you encounter a problem, break the problem down into smaller pieces. Solving a problem can sometimes seem overwhelming and impossible. To decrease anxiety and think more clearly, break the problem down. Identify the different parts it consists of. Then figure out one practical solution that you can take for each of those parts. Use those solutions. They may not solve the whole problem immediately. But those solutions can get you started and might solve a few pieces of it, explained Dhananjaya
Emotional impact
Every cloud has a silver lining is what they say. There is something positive that you can take out of every challenge or problem. It makes you more empathetic. It gives you the ability to relate to others and form relationships.
I have found that there is almost always a positive side to a problem. Perhaps it alerts us of a great way to improve our business or relationships. Or teaches us how our lives perhaps arent as bad as we thought. Finding this more positive part of the problem reduces its negative emotional impact. You may even start to see the situation as a great opportunity for you, said Dhananjaya
Dhananjaya has been inculcated with proper values in life. Proper ethics. He looks inward and outwards.
I want to engage in Social Service like helping the poor people and developing the public utility services. My aim in my spiritual life is defeating the three main poisons in the world - greed, anger, and ignorance. I focus my emotions and consciousness on one thing only. And that is why the Buddha was so calm, explained Dhananjaya
Saying that all human beings are equal and everybody have same rights, Dhananjaya pointed out that considering the situation in India and around the rest of the world, there are certain natural rights which women are deprived of.
All women and even men need not conform to the stereotypical thinking of society. However, when it comes to women they have the right to go out and come safely home at any time. This is a burning issue these days because of violence and sexual abuse against women. You cannot pin the blame on her modesty. She also has the right to choose her life partner on her own and marry at the age she wants to. Still, the barriers of caste and age restriction prevail. Another issue is having true economic independence. Even though there are increasing trends in the number of women working, their financial independence is still not fulfilled because of patriarchy, added Dhananjaya
Dhananjayas message to the youth is to learn to give up trying to control everything. Being a great leader is about influence and listening to those around you. These are attributes rarely taught in school.
Bad things do happen to me and how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness, immobilized by the gravity of my loss, or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I have  life itself, said Dhananjaya.

Chrysotile asbestos roofing products not health hazardous - Prof Fernando
Two studies conducted by the University of Moratuwa and the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) on chrysotile asbestos roofing products, (white) points out that they are not health hazardous.
On the critical issue of public health risk, to date not a single specific study that shows the disease burdens caused by chrysotile in Sri Lanka has been conducted.
Professor Ravindra Fernando, Chairman, National Dangerous Drugs Control Board, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo said, the latest scientific evidence published internationally strongly supports that Chrysotile is significantly less hazardous than the amphibole forms of asbestos (e.g. crocidolite and amosite) which are not imported to Sri Lanka and when properly controlled and used, chrysotile asbestos in its modern day high-density applications does not present risks of any significance to public and/or workers health.
Since 1955, Sri Lanka has used locally produced chrysotile containing roofing material for home and commercial use. Both international and domestic studies have shown that there is no clear evidence or data on health risks of chrysotile to workers or consumers.
Therefore, Sri Lanka should not ban the use of chrysotile asbestos.
The Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka (CCI) and the Chrysotile Information Centre of Sri Lanka (CIC) also shared the findings of two in-depth studies conducted by the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) and the University of Moratuwa on Chrysotile roofing products were shared with public at a conference held recently at the Hotel Ramada, Colombo.
These are the first-ever such studies to be conducted in Sri Lanka.
The first study, carried out by the NBRO, reviewed conditions in both the working (ambient) and general environment. The NBRO carried out the study focusing on chrysotile fiber exposure in three main areas  manufacturing sites, construction sites and demolition sites and houses - where Chrysotile cement roofing sheets are used.
According to H.D.S. Premasiri, Senior Scientist at Environmental Studies & Service Division, NBRO, all the exposure levels of chrysotile fibers in all three studies are much below internationally-recognized safety thresholds limit [OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) Standard of Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL)] which is 0.1 Fiber per cubic centimeter in all three studies.
Sunil Amarawansa, Director of the Chrysotile Information Centre added, In Sri Lanka there are four manufacturers engaged in the manufacture of Chrysotile cement fiber roofing sheets and all the factories have adopted the Safe Use of Chrysotile Fibre practice, minimizing the risk of Chrysotile fiber to become air borne and prevent exposure to workers.
The second study, conducted by the University of Moratuwa involved a comprehensive, comparative analysis of Chrysotile fibre cement roofing sheets and the proposed alternative fibre roofing sheets.
The study was conducted under the supervision of Professor Asoka Perera, Professor of Civil Engineering at the University, an recognized expert on cement and concrete, and an authority on the subject of developing alternative materials to Chrysotile cement roofing.
The purpose of this study was to understand the quality differences of alternative roofing materials versus chrysotile cement roof tiles. The results revealed that non-asbestos fiber cement roofing are nearly two times weaker than chrysotile asbestos sheets, they must be replace frequently, and the total life cycle cost is comparatively higher than Chrysotile Cement roofing sheets, he said.
Furthermore, the study suggests that proposed non-asbestos roofing sheets cannot replace current chrysotile-cement roof tiles because non-asbestos sheets are far below the required quality including durability and strength that are vital for the safety of the consumers. Since 1955, Sri Lanka has used locally produced chrysotile containing roofing material for home and commercial use. Both international and domestic studies have shown that there is no clear evidence or data on health risks of chrysotile to workers or consumers. Chrysotile asbestos roof sheets are the preferred choice of roofing materials, especially amongst Sri Lankas low and mid-income populations. A potential ban on Chrysotile poses adverse impacts on the national economy, even affecting householders affordability and quality of living conditions.
Asbestos is a commercial term, referring to two families of different, but naturally occurring fibre silicates, which are characterized by extraordinary heat resistance and strength. (SS)

Animal friendly Budget for 2018
On Daily News of November 11, Animal Rights Activist Lalani Perera has commented that Budget 2018 includes animal friendly elements which are laudable. She also states, globally the trend is to close down zoos, hinting for a better tomorrow for the animals held captive in the Sri Lankan zoo.
I want to add a few suggestions in support of this highly compassionate idea for the future of caged animals.
In a zoo, the animals held imprisoned for life, are not even guilty of a crime.
However large or open air a zoo is, it is infinitely small compared to the vast habitat wild animals are born to. So it is torture beyond compare to confine them to a lifetime of restricted movement, where their natural instincts in the joys of eating, playing, mating and sleeping are so thoroughly inhibited, as to make them tense and depressed.
They have an inborn fear of man. Imagine the trauma of being exposed to the nearness of their enemy, on a daily basis!
Our zoo should be closed down. The animals can be sent off to the countries or places of their birth. The others, who cannot be relocated for some reason or another, can be looked after till death, in a pleasant area in the premises, away from the eyes of the visitors.
A Virtual Reality Cinema and Park, should replace the zoo. Wide screens, with stereo sound, can be set up to show excellent documentaries of the various animals living in their natural habitat.
For a nominal fee, pamphlets on the lifecycle of the wild animals should be made available to educate the visitors.
The rest of the zoological gardens should be artistically laid out with trees, waterways, restaurants etc, to make it a pleasing environment for the visitors to pass the time.
Closing down our zoo and setting up a Virtual Reality Cinema and Park will showcase to the world our ethical behaviour towards defenceless and innocent wild animals, who are at the moment cruelly incarcerated for life, in zoos.

In crickets Ashes, can England tick without Big Ben
London: England are resigned to being without Ben Stokes for the whole of the Ashes series and it will be fascinating to see whether they can replace him -- and win without him -- against Australia.
Stokes, who was vice-captain to Joe Root, did not fly out with the rest of the squad after a late-night incident in which he appeared to get involved in a fight outside a Bristol nightclub in September.
Recently, there has been speculation that the 26-year-old all-rounder, often compared to former Test great Ian Botham, could return in time for the third of a five-Test series.
But with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) still waiting to discover if he will be charged by prosecutors, Stokes's Ashes participation remains uncertain.
Stokes's combination of skills -- powerful left-handed batting, lively seam bowling and brilliant close-catching, allied to an ability to inspire his team-mates -- make him one of the most highly prized players in world cricket today.
They also help balance the side, with England able to play an extra specialist bowler without weakening their batting.Such is Stokes's importance to England that many pundits believe they cannot win the Ashes without him.
"Stokes is two things - he's a class above the rest, and he's such a match-winner that he drags the team along with him," former Australia captain Ian Chappell told the Wide World of Sports.
"If he gets things right and plays really well, he's the sort of player who can lift the rest of the team.
"Without him they (England) are no chance (to win the Ashes)," he added.
Stokes's ability to shine even in the most difficult of circumstances was seen when he made his maiden Test century against Australia in Perth during the 2013-2014 Ashes series, where England suffered a humiliating 5-0 defeat.
This year Stokes, a genuine all-rounder, became the Indian Premier League's most expensive foreign player when he was signed by the Rising Pune Supergiant for 1.7 million ($2.2 million).
He justified the price tag by scoring 316 runs at a strike rate of 142.98, and taking 12 wickets at 7.18 in the Twenty20 event.
But if Stokes wins big, he can lose big too -- notably when Carlos Brathwaite hit him for four successive sixes to snatch a stunning win for West Indies in the last over of the 2016 World Twenty20 final.
Stokes, however, often demonstrates more guile than is suggested by his all-action approach.

Dahanayakes witty dimensions
A splendid article on Prime Minister W Dahanayake authored by Dr Upatissa Pethiyagoda rekindled in me effervescent memories of the rare maverick politician who added life to Parliament and fame to Galle.
Soaked in the soothing gems of English romantic poetry his witty parodies directed at Prime Ministers, Ministers and fellow members, too many to recall and reproduce here, often kept the House in fits of laughter. His mastery of the English language made him a legendary expert in the now-defunct Parliamentary art of filibuster. I remember he once made a 13-hour non-stop speech in Parliament to delay the passing of a bill.
Dahas claim that he shook a money tree scattering the fruits to be picked up by the voters of Galle has been often repeated for several decades. This historic brag is neither morally wrong nor unethical. As Dr. Pethiyagoda contends there need be no remorse in meeting guile with guile. The satisfaction that Daha would have got with voters accepting the bribes of Amarasuriya and voting against the latter is justifiable and understandable. His innocence remained untainted. This brag will remain a saucy bit of typical Wijayananda wit!
Bertrand Russells essay
Another conclusion of relevance is that the voters of Galle at the time were not idiots. They were wise enough to gleefully accept the largesse offered by power greedy givers and kick them out. Today, the country is in dire need of such voters. What a contrast! Politicians of today swimming in ill-gotten wealth shake and rattle Wine Stores and bars to roll out barrels and barrels for voters to guzzle and vote for them not once but even several times! Fools! What they should do is to as Dr. Pethiyagoda says take the largesse  the bottle, lunch packets, bus hires, Tea Shirts and Caps, but deny them convertibility!
On the subject of remorse after doing Something wrong I am reminded of an essay of Bertrand Russell that I read over 75 years ago as a schoolboy in which Lord Russell cites an instance where he claims that he derived immense satisfaction after uttering a lie.
Lanka Prajatantra Party
One morning when he was on his constitutional walk on an English country road he had seen a weary fox overtake him and turn right at the crossroads ahead of him. Moments later had followed a posse of red-jacketed huntsmen. The leading huntsman had pulled up near Lord Russell and enquired, Sir, did you see a fox go this way  Oh yes, a few seconds back a fox ran past me and turned left at the crossroads.
By uttering a lie and sending the fox hunters in the wrong direction, Bertrand Russell had saved an innocent life. Indeed he had good reason to be happy!
Personally, the few meetings I had with Daha are firmly etched in my memory. I was the ASP Ratnapura in the early sixties when he came campaigning as the leader of his new party, Lanka Prajatantra Party. Although Parliament stood dissolved he was the Prime Minister. After accompanying him in his official 1 Sri 1 Cadillac for whistle-stop meetings at Kahikatoa, Godakawela, Pallebedde, Embilipitiya, Panamure and Rakwana we ended up at the Pelmadulla Rest House for lunch.
William, the Rest House Ralahamy looking quite Impressive with his handlebar mustache and Silver buttoned white tunic coat greeted the Prime Minister with clasped hands. Before entering the room prepared for him, Ralahamy, bring me my gargling mixture, he ordered. It was half a tumbler of warm water laced with salt and sugar! After gargling his throat he had a stiff drink of arrack (the Rs. 8/= variety that came in an amber bottle) with a dash of lime juice and warm water. I had to politely turn down his offer of a drink saying that it was improper for me to take a drink as I was in uniform and on duty.
At his invitation, I sat down to lunch with him. When the lunch that consisted of hot plain white kekulu rice, kiri hodi, pol sambol and tempered sprats was served he called for his briefcase that was in the Cadillac, pulled out an envelope and sprinkled a brown powder over the white rice. He explained to me that it was rice bran that he always carried with him in his brief case!
Gentleman par excellence
The Pelmadulla Rest House Ralahamy of the early sixties of the last century was a remarkable character. On many an occasion, he proudly related to me of his meetings with Lord Soulbury, D.S. Senanayake, Sir John Kotalawala, Sir Richard Aluvihare and several other dignitaries. His pretty, English-speaking, only daughter got married to a young British engineer who was attached to the Udawalawe development project. The Englishman had fallen in love with her after she had served him a portion of Yorkshire pudding turned out by her!
When I was the Asst. Director of Police Training in the sixties in charge of recruitment almost all the applicants from Galle came with recommendations from Daha. They were beautifully handwritten in purple ink. Most of them failed to make the grade. At about this time when I chanced to meet him at Woodlands the residence of the Prime Minister, at a friendly chat, referring to his recommendations I reminded him of the saying, He who recommends everybody, recommends nobody. His response was Dont you know son; we politicians have to please everybody. Your job is to select the deserving ones!
Wijayananda Dahanayake, Prime Minister, Minister, teacher, lover of English Poetry, fair critic and exemplary parliamentarian was indeed a gentleman par excellence. Memories of this lovable maverick will live forever in the hearts of many.

Disastrous Smartphone
The secret of a full life is to live and relate to others as if they might not be there tomorrow, as if you might not be there tomorrow. ... This thought has made me more and more attentive to all encounters, meetings, introductions, which might contain the seed of depth that might be carelessly overlooked.
"This feeling has become a rarity, and rarer every day now that we have reached a hastier and more superficial rhythm, now that we believe we are in touch with a greater amount of people, more people, more countries. This is the illusion which might cheat us of being in touch deeply with the one breathing next to us. The dangerous time when mechanical voices, radios, telephones, take the place of human intimacies, and the concept of being in touch with millions brings a greater and greater poverty in intimacy and human vision." Nin wrote those words in 1946, but she might as well have been writing them today.
She starts with a YOLO and ends with a contemporary-sounding rumination of just how horrible we've all become now that we hold the power to be in touch with millions of people in the palms of our hands.
That's right, we're talking about how annoying and rude and antisocial we've all become with our smartphones and tablets. - CNN

The Provincial Public Service Commission called for applications to recruit English Diploma teachers and interviews for the posts were held in Trincomalee last month.
About 272 candidates were selected and about 120 were disqualified. They said they were put aside at the interviews even though they hold qualification for the posts.
They say HNDE holders have no other employments but to teach. Therefore, they request the Governor to resolve their issue and provide them with suitable employments.

Eric Rajapakse  Opticians celebrates  100 Years
Eric Rajapakse Opticians is celebrating 100 years, making history as one of the countrys oldest eye care brands in Sri Lanka.
When Alfred Rajapakse started Colombo Optical company in 1917 there was just a handful of other optical companies in the country. Eric Rajapakse moved the premises to Upper Chatham Street, establishing himself as a leading figure in the optical industry.
Rohan Rajapakse, after him, opened many branches, in Colombo, Kandy and Jaffna, expanding the business considerably. At the time, the company had a lens manufacturing plant in Ratmalana and a factory producing spectacle frames and were also agents for several prestigious retail brands such as Christian Dior, Dunhill, Pentax and Rodenstock. The company created the Eric Rajapakse School of Optometry, which has been instrumental in training many of the country's practising opticians.
Eric Rajapakse Opticians has been witness to the evolution of the optical industry in Sri Lanka. Starting out with a small number of long-established, family companies, the industry has become more competitive with new companies entering the market.
Brand awareness and easier distribution channels have contributed towards linking the optical industry with fashion and retail industry. The availability of all international brands has brought fashion retail into the optical business, explained Managing Director, Rajeev Rajapakse. Eric Rajapakse Opticians have had a hand in training, moulding and inspiring a great number of opticians in Sri Lanka. It is a great thing that many opticians, senior practitioners as well as new people, have worked with the company at some time, Rajapakse said, explaining that the importance of education and of sharing knowledge was very strongly instilled in him by his father.
The company continues to as an established brand in a fast evolving market, and Rajapakse states: We are proud to have had a hand in shaping the indstry, as we will continue to do into the future.

Justice League:
Exceptional and ebullient
Combining some of the foremost characters of the DC universe, Justice League delivers an action-packed, visually-pleasing superhero movie which is rather ebullient in comparison with its predecessors, albeit with a few shortcomings.
Following Supermans demise at the hands of Doomsday in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Batman discovers that the world now faces the very threat he was previously warned of; another alien invasion. Leading an army of parademons, the Apokoliptian known as Steppenwolf seeks to gather three sentient, extraterrestrial supercomputers called motherboxes capable of manipulating energy, in order to reshape the Earth in the image of his home-planet, Apokolipsan objective he was once prevented from achieving thousands of years into the past by the united forces of the Amazonians, Atlanteans, and mankind, amongst other powerful beings. In order to prevent humanitys impending doom, Batman, realising that he cannot stand against these nemeses alone, sets out to ally other meta-humans possessing special abilities, namely The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg, with the aid of Wonder Woman.
Smoother flow
The storyline and plot progression possessed an allure and established a stage for most of the superheroes to sufficiently display their powers and abilities. However, a few scene transitions in the beginning of the movie lacked a certain level of fluidity, and the movie as a whole, did feel rushed, perhaps due to the fact that Warner Bros. mandated a runtime of under two hours. As events unfolded thereafter, however, the movie attained a smoother flow. Although Steppenwolfs intentions were known from the early stages of the movie and no significant plot twists were present, Justice League counterbalances those setbacks as it manages to present stunning battle scenes accompanied by exceptional visual effects.
The dialogues compellingly conveyed the mysteries surrounding the incursion and the motherboxes, while hinting at what is to make its advent in the future of the franchise. The fears and regrets that the main protagonists bear in their hearts are effectively addressed, while their tragic pasts, although illuminated, still hold a certain mystery reserved for their upcoming standalone movies. The heroes learn to recognise and address their flaws in order to overcome the restrictions they impose upon themselves. The movie also brings out some enjoyable humour, even from characters who would usually not be inclined to do so. A noteworthy change that DC made with Justice League is the omission of its usual metaphors and parables, which was coherent with their previously darker, more dramatic essence.
The bonding between characters was quite entertaining, and was a pillar that firmly supported the storys charm. The main casts portrayal of their respective characters was consistent, as was it moving when needed be.
Newfound team
Batman, riddled with guilt, is seen on a journey for absolution, seeking to honour the memory of Superman. However, that very guilt is shown to lead him to make precarious decisions, albeit calculated.
He also attempts to co-operate with his newfound team, which deems challenging and leads him to be arrogant and insincere on certain occasions.
Wonder Woman still remains the unwavering, brave warrior, and learns to conquer her fear of leadership.
The Flash being socially-awkward, over-enthusiastic, and hyperactive; and Aquaman, with his charismatic and exuberant personality; bring in much amusement to the screen.
Cyborg is initially portrayed as dispirited, as he is still learning to accept and adapt to his new cybernetic body which was born of a motherbox, but grows to be more hopeful and cheery towards the movies conclusion.
Considering Steppenwolf, although he was presented as a challenging villain for the most part, there was no solid foundation or room allocated to build more character depth for him.
The Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) involved in the movie, especially considering the depiction of the surges of electricity related to the Speed Force, and the battle involving Steppenwolf and Aquaman in Atlantis, was brilliant. The final battle between the League and the parademons, with the collaboration of CGI and cinematography, was enthralling as well, and the dark yet vivid, fiery filter introduced to the environs in which it commences, along with the booming bombardments that take place in its presence, was captivating to the eye.
Even though DC proceeded in a different direction this time and succeeded in delivering a crowd-pleasing spectacle with Justice League, it was achieved at the cost of the usual solidity they offer. Nevertheless, with this movie, DC lays the foundation for a wider range of movies to come.

Flight of a nightingale
Latha Walpola, the greatest Living Legend of playback singing behind Sinhala Silver Screen, the golden voice ever created with Deshamanya Title, the second highest National Award, completes 70 years this year 2017 in her career in singing. This is a remarkable milestone in her life arguably as the longest Living Legend.
Latha was born on November 11, 1934 in Colombo to a family of seven members. Her father was Joseph Leenus Fernando, an employee of Cargills Ltd and her mother was Elizabeth Muriel, a teacher who always encouraged Latha to sing. She began her schooling at St. Anthony College, Galkissa. She became a member of the Church Choir leading as a small girl by the display of her innate skills in vocals. Latha has won accolades after accolades repeatedly with her high scale singing voice that captured the hearts of Music fans of the world.
Leading artists
Latha was born and bred in Galkissa ( Mount Lavinia) where she was fortunate to have associated with leading artists at the time residing in Galkissa who most willingly helped Latha to showcase her talents through Radio Ceylon. Among them were C.A. Fonseka, Susil Premaratna, Vincent de Alwis, Kalidasa Kurukulasuriya and C.T. Fernando.
C.A Fonseka the popular Radio dramatist who introduced many artists like Rukmani Devi, Susil and Fredy Silva to Kala Lokaya was a very close family friend of Latahs family. Latha lived at Peris Road, Galkissa and CA Fonseka lived on Siripala Road between Odean Cinema and Galkissa Cemetery which was walking distance from Lathas residence.
Known by childhood name as Rita Jenevi Fernando she was first introduced to then Radio Ceylon (Now Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation) at the age of 12 years by C.A.Fonseka, At the beginning, she took part in chorus singing in C.A. Fonsekas Sarala gee Programs with his sons Ervin and C.D Fonseka.
1947 was the unforgettable year of Lathas singing career when this future Nightingale of Sri Lanka then known as Rita Jenevi Fernando by birth sang her first song at the age of 12 yrs. Exactly 70 years ago, Vincent de Alwis, the versatile violinist at Radio Ceylon who was a close family friend of Latha extended the golden opportunity to sing a duet with him in his Sarala Gee Program. The song was Kandulu Denethe Vehena Kima Mata Pitu Pala Vedana Hada Vedana written by Sarath Wimalaweera and music composed by Vincent de Alwis himself.
High esteem
In recognition of her congenital talents and skills, Vincent de Alwis introduced her to Susil Premaratne who lived on St.Ritas Rd, Galkissa, and C.T.Fernando residing on Priyadharshanarama Rd, Dehiwala. Latha became the female partner in singing with Susil and C.T. She has spoken in high esteem of Susil considered as her Guru. Lo Ada Ninde, Salalihini Kowul, Mal Bara Himidiriye, Jesu Rajanani and Nisala Rae sung with C.T. and Mihiri Suwada, Nanwanu Sri Lanka Ran Wan Karalin Kalu Kelani Nadee. Ru Raese Adina Lese and many other songs sung with Susil in the latter part of 1940 and early 1950s are a few highly popular songs in every household even today.
The Legendary Cinema Sakvithi Gamini Fonseka recalled the memories of Latha at her 50th anniversary of becoming the leading female voice celebrated in 1997. Gamini was an Art student of Susil Premaratna in 50s. While he was drawing practicals at Susils home, Latha was rehearsing a song in the next room. Gamini became inquisitive to know where that melodious lovely voice was resonating. Gamini peeped into the room quietly as directed by Susil and saw a lovely teenage girl singing. This was how Gamini and Latha first met each other.
In recognition of her miraculous voice par with Latha Mangeshkar, Queen of Music in India, deep voice playback singer Susil Premaratne named this future Nightingale of Sri Lanka as one and only Latha of the island of Sri Lanka in 1949 or 1950. Not Jenevi, it was Susil & Latha coupled singers as published in all posters of musical shows in 1950, 51 and 52.
High demand
Namo Mariyanee recorded in 1948 became a household favorite in Sri Lanka showered upon with outstanding success. Talented with high scale voice she was in high demand for Church Carol songs. Seethala Duruthu Mahe, Nunwa Jaya Handa Pem, Soka Nege Mae Den, Oba Prema Raja Mage and many other songs recorded in 1948, 1949 and 1950s became highly popular together with Carroll songs composed by Fr Mercelyn Jayakody.
She was fortunate to have recorded a few songs like Sukomala Banda Lelawa, Dunhinda Helena and Diyaluma Helena originally sung by Chitra Somapala. By 1950 she became a shining spectacle invading the living rooms of each and every household in Sri Lanka by her beaming golden voice. Mohamed Ghouse, P.L.A.Somapala and B.S.Perera the famous musicians at the time brilliantly utilized her harmonious voice of high-pitched tone into their musical creations. All these musicians invited her to participate in all the musical shows organized throughout the island in early 50s.
In 1953 Latha made her debut in playback singing behind the screen in Eda Rae. Three duets were recorded as Hari Hari, Hebeta Mage Luck Kale, Prithi Prithi Darling with famous actor Herby Seneviratne and music composed by legendary Music Director Mohamed Ghouse. All these songs were comedy songs.
But her second film Prema Tharagaya screened in 1953 became the milestone in Lathas life. It was the starting point of Latha to become a playback singer to leading charters of movies. The duet Honda Hondama Weya Lowa Kisima Thenaka Neha in Prema Tharagaya was recorded by Latha and Dharmadasa Walpola who later became the Silver Voice behind Sinhala Silver Screen and paved the way not only to become the most demanding playback singers for main roles at the time, but also to be a lovely couple who after five years tied the nuptial knot on 12th of April, 1958.
From  Eda Rae screened in 1953 to Lantin Singaco in 2016 Latha rose to the apex of high reputation recording over 600 films including movies like Jeevithaya  Puran Appu never screened.
Musical career
A special feature is that Latha has recorded playback singing for almost every actress in Sinhala cinema except Rukmani Devi. During her musical career, she not only sang for actresses Rohini Jayakody, Thalatha Gunasekara and Girley Gunawardana in the 50s and 60s but also, fortunately, held the rare opportunity of singing behind the screen for their three daughters Veena Jayakody, Nadeeka Gunasekara and Sabita Perera who later became popular on the silver screen. As far back as the 1960s it became largely a profitable business to dub Sinhala dialogue into Hindi and Tamil movies running popular in Sri Lanka. Latha Walpola was adjudged the best for her outstanding performance in singing before original playback singers in India. She did playback singing for popular Indian actresses as Vyjayanthimala, Nimmi, Nadira et al.
It is hard to reminisce the exact number of songs that she has recorded last 70 years. Basically, it is presumed that the total number of songs would be over 6750 songs from her first song - Kandulu Denethe Wehena, a duet with Vincent de Alwis in 1947 to Sansara Mawathe, a duet with Dr. Nimal Senanayake in 2017.
She is not only the leading playback singer but also indisputably a successful artist. She sang for Famous Gee Malu such as Barisil, Kele Mal and Navarella of Premasiri Kemadasa, Daskon drama of Herbert M Senaviratna , Kumara Kassapa, an opera of Dayarthna Ranthunaga . In addition, she has played a few mini roles in three Sinhala films. Latha dubbed her pristine voice for Nimmi in Angulimala and Anjali Devi in Pathiwatha. Pushpa Sungara, an opera (Geetha Natakaya) was produced by Sesha Palihakkara for presentation in front of Queen Elizabeth II during her visit to Sri Lanka in 1952 dominated by Latha with W.D.Amaradeva, the main playback singer. She won various awards including Presidential Awards.
Latha is a gifted artist by birth with no single educational background in music who surprised the entire Sri Lanka. Latha is one of the rare singers who could sing in three octaves on high scale voice maintaining the voice unchanged. Most singers sing in two octaves. She has been in the apex of her talented skills in high degree during the last 70 years. As a tribute to her outstanding presentation of musical brilliance, the Government of Sri Lanka has quite appropriately honored her with Kala Suri Award in 1991 and Deshamanya Title, the second highest National Award in 2016 distinctively awarded to the rare and remarkable greatness of inestimable contribution made to Arts & Culture. May she be Well and Happy in Good Health. Lata Walpola, the indisputable Nightingale of Sri Lanka is a National Treasure worthy of Emulation.

Green pitches likely in Nagpur and Delhi too
India are likely to play the final two Tests of the Sri Lanka series on pitches helpful for fast bowlers as preparation for the forthcoming South Africa tour, which starts on January 5 in Cape Town.
The second Test of the Sri Lanka series will be played from November 24 in Nagpur, and the final Test in Delhi from December 2.
It is learnt that during the Australia ODI series in September, the Indian team management, led by coach Ravi Shastri, spoke to concerned officials in the BCCI and stated that the pitches for the Sri Lanka Tests should act as preparation for the South Africa tour. It is understood that Shastri emphasised that the pitches ought to be lively greentops, which are hard and bouncy.
It is also understood that the Nagpur pitch is covered evenly with grass and is expected to retain a greenish tinge when the second Test begins on Friday. According to concerned officials, the role of the spinners is likely to be negligible in the first half of the match, and more effective during the final two days.
Such a request from the team management is unusual only because India have fashioned Test victories at home against oppositions mostly on bald, turning tracks, which assist the spinners from the first day. Incidentally, India had played a Test on a rank turner, during Shastris time as team director, in 2015 against South Africa. The match ended in three days and was rated poor by the ICC match referee.
However, under Virat Kohli, India are keen to challenge themselves overseas and with Tests lined up in South Africa, England and Australia in the next 18 months, Indias players and coaches want to be prepared.
The greentop at Eden Gardens on the first morning of the first Test was a clear indication of the team managements thought process. Although Suranga Lakmal silenced the Indian top order in the first hour on a damp pitch, India, led by their new-ball pairing of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami, nearly stunned the visitors on the final day, taking seven wickets in a little over 26 overs.
After the first days play was truncated by rain in Kolkata, Indias batting coach Sanjay Bangar pointed out that India are now a team which doesnt really want to play in easy conditions.
He said players were open to playing on such challenging pitches as it only led to improvement.
On Monday, India opener KL Rahul admitted that such surfaces were a good test for the batsmen.
Its very clear that were preparing for the next two years that were going to travel abroad and play a lot of cricket overseas, and we are going to find wickets like this, and it is going to be challenging for all of us, so we wanted to prepare in that way.

IAPC&M  recognizes Deepal  Sooriyaarachchi   as accredited master coach
Well-known business professional, Deepal Sooriyaarachchi has recently been conferred the title of Accredited Master Coach & Mentor (AMC/M) by the International Authority for Professional Coaching & Mentoring (IAPC&M).
Based in the United Kingdom, IAPC&M provides accreditation for professional coaches, mentors, training providers and corporate in-house programmes across the globe that pass their vigorous criteria and commit to honour their exacting industry standards for the protection of the end user.
Sooriyaarachchi was awarded his accreditation after the IAPC&M validated his wealth of training, authenticated his certification and practically assessed his professional experience in the areas of coaching and mentoring as practised throughout his career that expands nearly three decades.
Consequently, he is the natural choice when contemporaries seek coaching, and or mentoring, personally and or professionally. Now that the highest industry authority in the world has endorsed his capabilities, Sooriyaarachchi will obviously continue to provide these services while enriching the management development work he currently engages in.
The IAPC&M uses a rigorous assessment process to maintain such high standards when accrediting anyone, be they a practitioner, senior, master or fellow coach/mentor. Sooriyaarachchi supplied over 40 testimonials, reflective case studies and conducted several live coaching sessions and was interviewed before achieving his AMC/M status. Ongoing CPD is also a fundamental part of accreditation.
Sooriyaarachchi currently focuses on mentoring very senior managers, mostly in the C suite, and business leaders. Deepal is a marketer by profession with a passion for developing people.
Sooriyaarachchi said, "I am humbled by this recent recognition of my competencies by the International Authority for Coaching and Mentoring and gives me greater encouragement in doing what I love, developing people. I have been helping many young professionals who are at thresholds of assuming greater responsibilities in their careers. Compared to their predecessors todays executives have to shoulder greater responsibilities much earlier in their life and they are constantly challenged to perform in an environment that is constantly changing. This poses extreme pressures on them and they need extra help to face them. The assistance of a professional coach or a mentor can mean a lot. Sometimes it is that extra perspective, reassurance is all what is needed for a person to move to the next stage. In a world where there is very little time to observe, reflect and learn from the phenomena it is nothing but common sense to have a professional help from an experienced coach or a mentor.

India prove why they are no. 1
India proved why they are the current no. 1 ranked Test team in the world when they fought back strongly from a hopeless position on the first four days to nearly pull off a sensational win in the first Test against Sri Lanka that ended in a nail-biting draw at Eden Gardens, Kolkata on Monday.
It is seldom that one sees Sri Lanka take a first innings lead over India in a Test played on Indian soil  they had done it only once before in a rain-hit first Test at Chennai in 2005 when Sri Lanka scored 168-4 after dismissing India for 167 - and 122 looked quite a handy one when India in their second innings slumped from 166 for no loss to 281-7, an overall lead of only 159 and looked in danger of having fight on their hands to save the Test.
But as it turned out Virat Kohli played a captains knock of 104 not out to steer his team through stormy seas and threw the challenge back at Sri Lanka by declaring at 352-8. It left Sri Lanka with a tricky period of 30 overs to survive or chase down 231 for their maiden Test win in India.
In the 26.3 overs that was possible before bad light ended the match it was Sri Lanka who were battling to save the Test at 75/7. By reducing Sri Lanka to such a moderate second innings score, India who had been on the back foot throughout the first three and half days of play would have gained their composure back for the rest of the series.
As for Sri Lanka they made use of a good toss and the conditions well to put India under the skids to bowl them out for their second lowest total 172 against them in India. It was no surprise to see the seamers from both sides dominating the match in seamer-friendly conditions and on a pitch with grass described by Sri Lanka head coach Nic Pothas as more English than subcontinent.
What Suranga Lakmal, Lahiru Gamage and Dasun Shanaka did for Sri Lanka with the new ball the Indian trio of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammad Shami and Umesh Yadav matched to perfection that resulted in a rare occasion where for the first time in India the home team spinners didnt pick a single wicket in a Test.
From Sri Lankas point of view it was a far better display than they put up in the Test series against India at home some three months back when they were routed in all three Tests inside four days. If not for the bad weather and light that clipped off several hours of play over the five days there might have been a repetition of that.
Sri Lanka cannot be too happy with their batting for had it not been for their bowlers Rangana Herath and Suranga Lakmal they would never have got to a total of 294 after being 201-7.
The top order has to fire and like former captain Angelo Mathews pointed out getting to fifties wouldnt help you win a Test match. Mathews and Lahiru Thirimanne both scored fifties but failed to convert them into big ones and extend them into match winning proportions.
Mathews batting at no. 4 is a good move, he is the most experienced of the batters and that position gives him the opportunity to play a big innings for his team and for the others to bat around him. The key to Sri Lankas batting is Dimuth Karunaratne and Mathews. Karunaratne has the ability to play long innings and hold up one end so that the others can play freely and contribute to the total as they did in the two-Test series against Pakistan.
However one area that Sri Lanka needs to address is their second innings. Even in the Pakistan series although they managed to win both Tests their second innings was suspect being dismissed for 138 in the first Test and 96 in the second. Here again at Kolkata they were reeling at 75/7.Batting under pressure is something that the Lankan batsmen are not quite accustomed to.
That comes with experience and the Lankan batting line up does not have that with the exception of Mathews. Although they displayed some of it against Pakistan if was only in the first innings.
The second innings batting was quite a different story. The next two Tests in the series are not going to be easy as India is certainly going to come back at them with all guns blazing. Sri Lanka had better watch out.

Inflation, as measured by the change in the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI), which is compiled by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), increased to 8.8 per cent in October 2017 from 8.6 per cent in September 2017, on year-on-year basis, the Central Bank said in a news release yesterday.
The change in the NCPI measured on an annual average basis increased from 6.8 per cent in September 2017 to 7.1 per cent in October 2017.
When the monthly change is considered, the NCPI increased from 123.3 index points in September 2017 to 124.8 index points in October 2017.
This monthly increase was mainly due to the increase in prices of the items in the Food category which was led by adverse supply side developments.
Price increase of coconuts, vegetables and rice were prominent. Nevertheless, prices of fresh fish and eggs declined.
Meanwhile, the impact of LP Gas price revisions introduced in September 2017 was also observable. Furthermore, Restaurants and Hotels sub-category too recorded a price increase during the month.
The NCPI Core inflation, which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy, continued to follow the declining trend exhibited since the early months of the year. As such, the NCPI Core inflation decreased to 4.1 per cent in October 2017 from 4.6 per cent in September 2017 on year-on-year basis.

John Milton of Areopagitica fame
Just the other day, a Ceylon University friend, an encyclopedist, phoned and asked whether the government, whom he knows, despite the stumbles, have my support, intends to introduce some form of press censorship. I replied this may be a dead rope of an agent provocateur, given the classical background of both the President and the Prime Minister and not give much credence to rumor. Nevertheless I thought, since the subject of censorship was raised, it is prudent to give John Milton's views on censorship, even though l am on the horns of a dilemma not knowing how to tame shadowy, scurrilous, scumbags, addicted to bombast, slander and hogwash, when they mount attacks on the innocent.
In 1644 Milton published the Areopagitica, an appeal to Parliament to revoke their Licensing Order of June 16, 1643.This order was meant to bring publishing under government control by creating a number of official censors to whom authors would submit their work for approval prior to having them published. Milton's argument was censorship is little more than an excuse for state control of thought. Recognizing that some means of accountability was necessary to ensure that libellious or other illegal statements were kept under check(noteworthy examples are the recent lament in Parliament by a member complaining about some erroneous, mischievous and irresponsible garbage thrown at him at the Bond Commission hearings, when charges he argued, must rest on evidence not to be invalidated by any argument which human wit can devise or by information found in old cabin trunks and under weather beaten mattresses and the other a citizen traveling to Hulftsdorp, seeking redress for being humiliated by mockery, billingsgate, intimidation by black coated brethren, seated in high cushioned revolving chairs, at the office of the AG).
As the essayist Edward Gunawardene, reputed for his biting wit, recently pointed out in the Daily News, these petty, black coated, money changers shock the senses of the decent and referred to the coup case where the 3 court bench of MC Sansoni, LB de Silwa and HNG Fernando received much respect from the Silks, even though the latter were fighting a rearguard action against the evidence. Evidence, if not for the grace of God, would have placed me also in the dock.
Stifling an opinion is an ugly evil. If the opinion is right we are robbed of an opportunity of exchanging error for truth. If it is wrong we are deprived of a deeper understanding of the truth, in its collision with error.
But what is different today is the strength given to the printed word to disperse widely at the speed of light. These powerful means not only express they modify, change and distort. Nourished by the underlying skepticism, gross ignorance and ineptitude that pervade modern society, often seen, ad nauseam, in monopolizers of newspaper opinion columns, they employ the old sophist tricks to weaken the stronger argument and color the implausible. Thanks to the new found power they rule the world more than they did when Milton wrote the Areopagitica. Then, reason constituted as it were the solar system, within which truths like epicycles, moved.
Milton was admired by his peers. In 1802 Wordsworth wrote.
Milton, thou shouldst be living at this hour
Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea
England hath need of thee
She is now a fen of stagnant water

Kohli left fuming by Dickwellas antics
Virat Kohli and Team India were on a mission in the final session of the opening Test against Sri Lanka at the Eden Gardens on Monday. However, the visitors pulled out all the stops to try and derail Indias charge.
One such instance occurred when Niroshan Dickwella took the cue from some footballers and tried the dark art of time-wasting.
Kohli and pacer Mohammed Shami were having none of it and blasted Dickwella for his time-wasting antics.
Kohli was visibly furious and was seen angrily gesticulating at the umpires.
Nigel Llong finally got Dickwella and Kohli together, had a chat with the two and calmed things down before the situation could boil over. Former Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene took to Twitter to laud Dickwellas antics had words of praise for the Indian skipper as well and a certain Virat Kohli even replied to it.
Mahela Jayawardene @MahelaJay
Enjoyed @NiroshanDikka attitude and antics this afternoon. Good test match.. well played @imVkohli. Looking forward to the next one.
Virat Kohli @imVkohli
Replying to @MahelaJay @NiroshanDikka
Yes, test cricket at its best. Onto the next one now.
Kohli smashed a scintillating century, his 18th in Tests and 50th overall in international cricket, as India set Sri Lanka a 231-run target to win.
The visitors were left reeling as Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami took centre stage and destroyed the Sri Lankan batting order.
Sri Lanka were 62 for four when Dickwella took his time-wasting tactics too far and left Kohli fuming.
Sri Lanka only had a bit more than two hours to negotiate and they almost faltered. They huffed and puffed and somehow survived.
In the end, Sri Lanka were reduced to 75 for seven when bad light came to their rescue.

Loneliness: the most devastating malady
A survey was conducted a couple of years ago in Switzerland with one hundred participants - men, women and the youth of all ages - to find out three main problems that make them unhappy. All of them gave three different reasons, but 78 of them had stated one common reason that was responsible for having eluded them of their happiness. That common reason was Loneliness. While analyzing the causes of loneliness, a gamut of interesting, but at the same time, very sad information was revealed by the participants.
Children said they felt lonely because their parents had little time for them. The teenagers - the community that is in focus in our country for wrong reasons, and is omnipresent these days in various crisis situations than ever before - felt misunderstood and alienated from their elders.
There was also the loneliness within the marriage bond, where either or both spouses felt estranged from their partners, even while living together in the most intimate of relationships. Most poignant of all the rest was the loneliness of the middle-aged and the aged individuals, who felt useless and unwanted. Such information substantiates that loneliness strikes without regard to age, place or condition.
Dr. Paul Tournier, the eminent Swiss psychiatrist, who supervised the said survey declared at the end that Loneliness is the most devastating malady that has affected people of all ages. We, in Sri Lanka, in our unparalleled wisdom, might argue that it may be the case of Swiss, that is not our cup of tea, because, in Sri Lanka, we are a unique nation of people, who need not feel lonely, since we have so many things to engage in and feel happy. We can only congratulate them for their vision.
Loneliness and aloneness
It has been scientifically proved that loneliness is the seed condition from which sprouts a host of other problems which inhibits the spirit of the modern man and woman. The opinion of most medical experts is that there is no human condition so acute or so universal. The mal-effects of loneliness seep deeply into many of our most vexing problems. Various studies on loneliness have proved that most people seeking help due to their feelings of loneliness. Another study indicated that loneliness had triggered many people to make decisions to take extreme action of committing suicide.
We have to distinguish between loneliness and aloneness, as they are far from the same. Aloneness can bring on loneliness and often it does. But, it necessarily need not. Some of the most active and productive people themselves be alone most of their time. But they have learned to use their solitude creatively. Even biologically, we need periods of aloneness. It helps us to generate more physical and spiritual strength to face our more crowded workloads. If and when we do not act in such manner, it may tend to drive us towards loneliness.
Psychological condition
Unlike when an external factor like a germ or a virus is instrumental in making us sick, our sickness of loneliness is created by our own self, because it involves our mental faculty. In other words, our loneliness is felt in our mind, and it is a mental or a psychological condition, which has nothing to do with any physical part of our body. Therefore, we can argue that our loneliness is the result of what we do or do not do, how we behave or how we do not behave and so on. So, it is a case of our attitudes, our thoughts and our deeds, that creates our loneliness on one hand, and will help us to shun the illusion of loneliness, on the other hand.
However, there are a number of methods we can follow to rid of us the feelings of loneliness. Here are some of them:
Finding our tribe: Selecting like-minded friends with common interests. All of us will then be open, proactive and creative and will work towards the same purpose, thereby impacting on our attitudes, thoughts and deeds, leaving no room for loneliness.
Seeking true friends: Our being surrounded by many people does not help us to get out of loneliness. We need at least one close, trustworthy and reliable friend. Then only a closeness between us will mature, which in turn helps both parties to care about each other in a meaningful way, and drive loneliness of each other out of bounds.
Tap into our compassion: Compassion is a great human quality, though rarely exhibited these days. But if we practice compassion first towards our own self and then towards others, we will be kept busy and positively engaged most of the times. Thus we shall have no time to be lonely and feel the distress of loneliness. All existing religions teach us to be compassionate. So it is more or less mandatory.
Be with nature: Nature and its varied resources are a great remedy for all kinds of human ailments. Their beauty, the potential and the intervention with human life are all of enormous efficacy, so much so, that they can create many alternatives to replace the feelings of loneliness. A walk on the beach, a picnic to a nearby park, a hike to the woods help us to enjoy the beauty around us. We watch, listen and breathe the air and experience the grace of the fauna and flora and the wonders of Mother Nature.
Practice gratitude: In order to keep our mind busy and engaged in some virtuous activity, because loneliness is a mind and mentality based condition, it will be very pertinent and helpful to think of those with gratitude who helped us to build our life. Caring for another person will make us feel connected and happy that we were able to help the needy or nurture someone in difficulty. All such details will keep our mind occupied, leaving no room for loneliness.
People think being alone makes you lonely, but dont think that is true. Being surrounded by the wrong people is the loneliest thing in the world.
- William Shakespeare

In Love with the Heartbreaking Beauty of the Discomfort
With my body in pain, I looked up at the sunlight and kept my heart open. And I took in the heartbreaking beauty of life. I witnessed it, and found it to be miraculous, pain and struggle and discomfort and all. It wasnt beautiful in spite of the pain  the pain was a part of its total beauty. The struggle and discomfort itself was heart-renderingly gorgeous, as was everything else in the moment.
This weekend I took part in a workshop on relationships and intimacy called the Art of Fearless Intimacy, by John Wineland and Kendra Cunov. Theres a lot I could write about the weekend, which was life-changing, but I want to speak to just one moment. The moment: I was in a standing pose, doing about a quarter squat, with my arms raised in the air. For what seemed like an eternity. I was looking deeply into another mans eyes, a complete stranger, and also a brother and fellow warrior. We held each others eyes, and matched each others breath, for more than half an hour.
We came to be in deep discomfort, holding ourselves in stillness in that pose. My shoulders ached, screamed for mercy, wanted nothing more or less than rest from the work. My mind wanted to get away from the discomfort. And in this moment, I could see my mental habit: reject discomfort and pain, shut it down, get away from it, find peace from it.
This is a pattern that has held me in sway since boyhood. In this moment, I found a place where I was devoted to this brother, and wouldnt let him down. I wanted to show him, through my gaze, my deepest soul, my devotion to those I loved, my fierce heart ready to go to battle for him, for my family, for all of you. - Zen Habits

Lovers Leap
As far back as 1968, two collectors of folktales from the West Indies were in search of a publisher for their maiden collection of narratives. They have been actively engaged in the collection of these folktales, especially from those members of the families who have come to Jamaica from various parts of African continent.
The collection by Rev Eddie Burke and Anne Garside was titled as Water in The Gourd and Other Jamaican Folk Stories and contains seven narratives of varying experiences. As accepted by the Oxford University Press, the book came to light initially in 1975 and late in 1979.
The printed book was widely discussed. One of the folk stories titled as Lovers Leap came to be discussed from various points of view, as it revolved around several complex issues in the West Indies human frame of living. The setting of the story was true to life and goes as follows:
Historical accord
On the South Coast of Jamaica in the Parish of St Elizabeth is a great cliff which rises hundreds of feet above the sea. From here one can see the whole south coast of the island spread far below. The highest point on the cliff is known as Lovers Leap. This setting is followed by a historical accord of the situation.
Over 200 years ago, the Lovers Leap was called Pedro Point, the highest point on the great Pedro Bluff. A lookout was kept there to give warning of pirate or enemy ships, for Jamaica was attacked from time to time by the Spanish and French fleet which came sweeping around the western end of the island.
With these details in the background, the reader comes to know a certain story of how the said cliff got the name Lovers Leap. As the retelling goes, Pedro Point was on the property of a very wealthy planter, Josiah Yardley. He is depicted as a hard man, hard in his dealings and harsh in his dealings with the slaves in his plantation. As the story is retold, Yardley had kept one of his slaves as a permanent lookout or a watcher on Pedro Point to watch the enemy ships.
The name of the young slave was Kunu John. Kunu was well known for his steadfastness and had been a prince among his own people in Africa. He was also known for his anti-slavery activities though he was forced to be a slave. In spite of the punishment, sometimes imposed, he refused to obey his Master Yardly. Finally, it was decided that Kunu be given the position of the watcher on Pedro Point. But what happens could be perhaps unbelievable. Kunu was not always alone on the cliff. A pretty slave girl named Tansy came to see him during the night. Kunu and Tansy loved each other.
Below the cliff
But as things go on, certain things around them changed. But the reader comes to know how sensitive the romance is. The Two lovers swear to each other that they will never be parted. As the story moves a day comes when the country tends to be peaceful at last, and it was no longer necessary to keep a lookout on the cliff. Yardley wants the brave slave Kunu to come back to the plantation down below the cliff. Yardley too wants to get rid of him by selling him to another master in the slave market, named as Spanish Town.
Tansy comes to know about the news. She gets to know it from her fellow slaves. Tansy felt that her heart would burst. As such, she stole out of the house during the daytime to meet Kunu on the cliff. They meet each other. Kunu is surprised to see her at an odd time. Both of them discuss the matter.
This folktale is written in such a sensitive mood that it comes close to a modern short story. Tansy and Kunu decide to run away from the entire human surrounding. But Kunu thinks furthermore on the issue and says that he does not wish to get caught and as such prefers to end up his life by not getting sold once more, instead die by leaping down the cliff. But before I die I must tell you a story that I have listened from my people in Africa, says Kunu to Tansy.
Legend rewritten
This sub-story, as I hard, had become one of the favourite mini-narratives in Jamaica. I wish to draw your attention to the legend as it is rewritten in the collection. In the days when the world was very young, the sun and moon were always quarrelling with each other. The moon felt that the sun had a much better time of it than she because there were more goings on in the daytime. People were eating and working and fighting and laughing and talking, and the sun could look on and enjoy it all. When the moon finally rose in the sky, there were the three frogs to keep her company. The rest of the world was asleep. At last, she could stand it no longer and went to complain to the great Earth Mother.
What happens next in the sub-story is fascinating.
To the great Earth Mother, the moon says that she has divided world unfairly, by saying that she has favoured the sun and disfavoured the moon. The great Earth Mother smiles when she hears the complaint of the moon and says:
Daughter, do not be discontented with your lot. It is true that the sun has all the hustle and bustle of the work a day world, but you have a special charge over all brave men who seek freedom. You must shine to give them hope and courage. As you go up the sky, it will be a sign to them that there is another world beyond the grave. And it will be a sign to lovers that they can find eternal love together if they choose.
Though it is hinted as to what will follow, the main story does not come to a close. One step further is kept.
While Kunu the slave had been telling his story, the conch had been blown to signal the end of work int eh fields. It was already evening.
The events take another turn of interest. A dialogue between the two ensues. Kunu says: You must go back to the house soon, Tansy.
And you Kunu, what will you do
When the moon rises, Tansy, I will jump off the cliff. Better death than a life of slavery and separation from you. That way I shall be free.
Let me jump with you Kunu. Lets jump together, then no one can part us ever again. The inseparable moment comes hinting the height of romantic belief put into action. The final commentary in the story becomes a statement of fact when the following comments are inserted.
The next morning Yardley got up as usual and called for Tansy to bring him his hot water. But there was no Tansy. Yardley was annoyed. IN a very bad temper he went up to Pedro Point to tell that he was going to sell him in the slave market, but there was no Kunu either. Yardley was furious. He rode all over his property asking if anyone had seen the missing couple. The folk narrative reaches a point of illumination when a half-crazy old woman who lives by herself in a little hut near the cliff/edge comes out with news which reaches the level of fantasy. According to her, she had gone out last night to gather herbs and had seen two figures jump together over the edge of the cliff. The moon had caught them up in a great golden net, and when she looked again she had seen them walking on the moon. The reader of the Jamaican folk story is given a lesson in reality and fantasy.

Mastercard - Educate Lanka  empower young women
Mastercard and Educate Lanka presented the first batch of Mastercard sponsored scholarships to educate female students from socioeconomically marginalized backgrounds at a ceremony held recently in Kandy.
Mastercard had partnered with Educate Lanka earlier this year to initiate the scholarship program, as a part of its Doing Well and Doing Good initiative to empower young women in Sri Lanka.
We are excited to have taken the first step towards a deeper collaboration with Mastercard to create an inclusive and equitable society and look forward to realizing the full potential of our collective visions. This is also an opportunity for us to demonstrate the efficacy of a sustainable and impactful corporate-social partnership model in helping Sri Lanka to advance its socioeconomic targets and meet its commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, said Manjula Dissanayake, Founding President of Educate Lanka.
In addition to offering financial assistance, the program also provides mentorship, skills training, career and leadership advancement, and employment opportunities through Educate Lankas complementary programs. This helps ensure that the students have the best opportunities for a successful life. The program also allows them to learn directly from members of the Sri Lankan business community, thereby directly enhancing their wealth of knowledge and employability.
Mastercard has always been about creating a lasting positive impact and a brighter, more inclusive future. Our partnership with Educate Lanka helps us accomplish these goals through the power of education. This will also help create a stronger workforce and increase the nations global competitiveness. We congratulate the first batch of scholarship recipients who are striving to end the cycle of poverty and reaching for a better life, said R.B. Santosh Kumar, Country Manager  Sri Lanka & Maldives, Mastercard.
Educate Lanka is the brainchild of Manjula Dissanayake, who identified that despite Sri Lanka having a universal education system, poverty still keeps students away from the opportunities they deserve. Realizing that education is the key to a prosperous future, he founded Educate Lanka, which has provided funding from secondary through higher education for more than 1,000 students since 2007.

Mugabe faces Impeachment
ZIMBABWE: Zimbabwe's ruling party was expected to launch impeachment proceedings against President Robert Mugabe, in the latest bid to oust the 93-year-old strongman still clinging to power after 37 years in office.
A military takeover last week was followed by huge street protests against the authoritarian leader, and the ZANU-PF, his own once-loyal party, has also turned against him.
The party has instructed the chief whip to proceed with impeachment processes, ZANU-PF said in a statement, with the motion due to be presented before parliament on Tuesday.
On Monday evening, army chief Constantino Chiwenga told reporters that progress had been made in talks towards an apparent exit deal for Mugabe, the world's oldest head of state.
He also said Mugabe was in touch with Emmerson Mnangagwa, the ousted vice president whose sacking led to the military takeover and Mugabe's shock loss of power.
The security services are encouraged by new developments which include contact between the president and the former vice president... who is expected in the country shortly, Chiwenga said. The nation will be advised of the outcome of talks between the two. Chiwenga called for calm after Zimbabweans had celebrated Saturday at anti-Mugabe marches that would have been brutally repressed just a week ago.
The marchers' joy quickly turned to despair as Mugabe brushed aside the turmoil, blithely declaring on Sunday that he would chair a top-level meeting of the party that had just disavowed him.
In a televised address, the president defied expectations he would step down, pitching the country into a second week of political crisis.
Mugabe is feted in parts of Africa as the continent's last surviving independence leader.
He was a key figure in the war for independence and took office as prime minister in 1980, riding a wave of goodwill.
His reputation was swiftly tarnished, however, by his authoritarian instincts, rights abuses and economic policies.
Most Zimbabweans have known life only under his rule, which has been defined by violent suppression, economic collapse and international isolation.
Despite his fragile health, Mugabe had previously said he would stand in elections next year that could have kept him in power until he was nearly 100 years old.
But a factional squabble over the presidential succession erupted into the open on November 13, precipitating the crisis.
Mugabe's wife Grace, 52, secured prime position to succeed her husband when Mnangagwa, who is close to the military leadership, was abruptly fired.
After Mnangagwa fled abroad, the army took over the country and placed Mugabe under house arrest. The army insists it has not carried out a coup, but rather an operation to arrest allegedly corrupt supporters around the Mugabe family. ZANU-PF lawmakers said that they would take the first steps to impeach Mugabe on Tuesday after he ignored their ultimatum to resign. We have the numbers, the opposition is also going to support us, Vongai Mupereri, a party MP, said. We are going to impeach -- the man has to go, said another Zanu-PF lawmaker, MacKenzie Ncube.
Chris Vandome, an analyst at the Chatham House, a London-based think-tank, warned of the risk of public unrest.
They will start impeaching him (Tuesday), that is certainly the will of the military, but it's increasingly now the will of the people, Vandome told AFP. The longer this goes on for, the more the likelihood of violence increases. Legal experts say impeachment could take weeks and be subject to court appeals.
Mugabe is thought to be battling to delay his exit in order to secure a deal that would guarantee protection for him and his family.
It might take days and weeks, but Mugabe is on his way out, said Charles Muramba, a 46-year-old bus driver in Harare.- AFP

Multifaceted maiden novel
Ithayaththin Unarvukal (The Feelings of the Heart) is a novella by Furhan B Ifthikar, an enterprising and versatile broadcaster and writer, who in some sense a pioneer woman artiste in bringing novelty in her innumerable broadcasts over Sri Lankan radio. Fluent in three languages, she holds a Masters degree in Tamil. Her broadcast in Sinhala on a Muslim programme is also appreciated by many listeners. She is in the field since 1958. Earlier in 1999, her collection of short stories Pirantha Munn (Born Land) was published.
The present work was adjudged the best fiction in the competition for novel writing in connection with the Edirisinghe Sarachchandra Sahitya Festival.
Her theme of this short fiction is that according to her, No woman at heart will accept that her husband is also a husband of another woman.
Although a Muslim man could have four wives, if he can maintain all of them, usually it is one man one wife that prevails in the country.
But in this story, a nobleman married happily to a rich beautiful girl and having two young sons and expecting another baby takes another unmarried mature woman as his second wife secretly out of lust and also in empathy to help the latter to enter into marriage.
The conflict in emotions of the two main protagonists- the husband and first wife- is the plot of the story.
But what is remarkable in the story is that after the birth of third child, the first wife decides on the advice of another woman who was confronted with a similar problem, punishes her husband by deciding to refuse any more sexual contact with her husband. She felt it was degradable when her husband had enjoyed the body of another woman.
In any case, there is a resolution at the end of the story.
But what I liked in this exposition of a kind of personal and social problem is that the craft in writing which the writer has employed.
I say this because many of the short story writers in Tamil ignore the attention that should be paid in the structure of a work of fiction as they are pre-occupied with narrating social problems as if they are pontificating in an essay for instance.
There is fluidity in her narration and the writers short sentences in her style of writing are welcome as the grip in the storytelling holds the reader with interest. Substantiated with excerpts from the Muslim Law enables the non-Muslim readers to understand the context better.

My contact with Aloysius was to gather information for book on Bond issue- Sujeewa
International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe yesterday defended himself against the aspersions cast on him with regard to several telephone calls he made with Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) owner Arjun Aloysius.
He said he contacted Aloysius solely for the purpose of deriving information to compile the book he did on the Bond issue.
The Bond issue was a complex subject to understand and we needed to collect all possible information to defend the UNP which was caught in a political web, Senasinghe said.
Senasinghe made these observations at a media briefing at Sirikotha last morning.
He also made several observations on the COPE inquiry and the Auditor Generals report on the Treasury Bond issue.
Senasinghe speaking of the alleged telephone conversations between him and Aloysius,he challenged the CID to find any deal that he and Aloysius has come into.
I am a lawyer with a good understanding of criminal law. If I really wanted to fix a deal with Aloysius, do you think I would have used my phone to do so. I could have used somebody elses phone. Of these said 30 or 40 alleged calls that I have made to Aloysius, I challenge the CID to find out a single conversation between us on any so called deal, he said.
State Minister Senasinghe, displaying his assets declaration to the cameras, requested not to level false allegations against him with regard to corruption. He pointed out that it was he and Minister Ajith P. Perera who included in the COPE report that the conduct of Perpetual Treasuries Limited seems to have been suspicious.
Senasinghe also said that it was he who directed the most number of questions at Aloysius at the COPE inquiry.
Senasinghe also pointed out that there was external pressure against him becoming a COPE subcommittee member which inquired into the Treasury Bond issue.
Senasinghe also said he never contacted Aloysius until the first COPE subcommittee inquiry on the Bond issue was over.
Aloysius was questioned at the first COPE subcommittee inquiry and he was not summoned to testify before the second COPE subcommittee investigating into the Bond issue.
The second COPE subcommittee accepted the evidence recorded by the first COPE subcommittee as part of its own evidence.
Senasinghe also said that most of the investigations against the Treasury Bond issue were exploited to discredit the UNP.
The Auditor General took that side. The COPE Chairman took the same side. And D.E.W. Gunasekara also took that side,Senasinghe alleged.
I could remember how Gunasekara was trying hard to submit the first COPE subcommittee report just prior to the last general election, Senasinghe said.
Speaking on the same topic, Senasinghe pointed out that the evidence relating to the said telephone conversations were submitted to the Treasury Bond Commission as part of the same political agenda to defame the UNP. The Commission has pointed out that it cannot accept this evidence since they are outside the mandate. So why bring out such evidence at all he questioned.
Senasinghe also questioned as to why all the telephone conversations that Aloysius had with about 41 MPs in Parliament was not put forward at the Commission.
Senasinghe speaking on the Auditor Generals report, said it has an incorrect loss calculation of the questioned Bond issuance on February 27,2015 and further said the Supreme Court has given a ruling to that effect.
Senasinghe also said that the Auditor General prepared a report on the questioned Treasury Bond issuance and said he turned a blind eye towards the findings they forwarded to him on the Bond issue.
Speaking of the COPE inquiry into the Treasury Bond issue, Senasinghe said it is morally incorrect of having MP Sunil Handunnetti as the Chairman of the subcommittee since he had a partial opinion on the subject.
Senasinghe further said that it was Handunnetti who was the first to raise concerns regarding the Treasury Bond issue and pointed out that Handunnetti had a politically driven opinion on the matter.
Thus, Senasinghe said it is incorrect for a Chairman of a Subcommittee to have a biased opinion.

Next Campus student wins Alumnus Award at Birmingham City University graduation
Bringing prestige and recognition to both his institute and the country, Devinda Fernando, a student of NEXT Campus was the recent recipient of the alumnus award from the Birmingham City University.
Bagging this award at the 2017 graduation of the University held in UK, Devinda received the award from the Faculty of Computing, Engineering and the Built Environment as the top prize winner and the most outstanding student, achieving distinction for six subjects out of eight for the year 2017.
Contributing towards attaining this award was the distinction he received for his dissertation and the contribution of the study in the apparel industry that was focused on the influence of the supply chain collaboration in the Sri Lankan textile and apparel industry.
The scope of this accomplishment is compelling as Devinda had to compete against a large number of top students, many of them from graduate programs at well-established schools and Universities across many countries. With only a few top performing students being nominated this prize, Devindas award not only celebrates his visionary thought leadership but also recognizes him as a forward thinking leader in his industry.
Devinda currently holds the position of Assistant Manager - Corporate Strategy at one of the newest but most successful new organizations to enter the business arena in Sri Lanka, Hela Clothing.
Devinda paid tribute to his institute and said, If I do anything well, anything innovative, and anything unique in my studies it is due to the extraordinary learning experience I had at NEXT Campus.
This award will be immensely beneficial to the Campus because as it ultimately is a recognition of the value that NEXT imparts to their students. As for myself, receiving this award means that there will be many new and exciting prospects that will open up for me.
Congratulating him on his award, Director of NEXT Campus Kumudu Abeyawardane acknowledged The Awards are all about honoring the success of top individuals whose achievements have been exceptional, innovative and denotes value to the industries they research and study about. We at NEXT celebrate this achievement along with him and congratulate him not only on his impressive success but also in the capacity as an ambassador for our Campus in upholding the high standards we teach all our students, which we expect them to uphold in both their personal and professional life."

A private higher education institute for medical education:Minister Kiriella
SAITM would gradually be abolished and a parallel not-for-profit private higher education institute would be newly established for medical education, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
The Minister who was speaking at the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday when Finance Heads of his Ministry were taken up, said SAITM students and other students seeking private sector medical education could enrol to this new non-governmental institution.
Observing that private sector investment for education is important to broaden higher education opportunities for students who do not get a chance to enter State universities, Kiriella said free education in the country would not be affected by private sector involvement.
Many accused our Government of trying to hamper free education, but anybody who goes through the budgetary proposals for the next year, would be convinced of our commitment to protect and strengthen the state sector education.
We have proposed to set up three new medical faculties and seven new technological faculties.
A health insurance cover would be granted to University students. We have increased the number of students who are entitled to the Mahapola by another 3,500, he noted.
Replying to the concerns raised by JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa, the Minister also refuted claims that there was a severe shortage of academic staff at State universities.
The total number of approved academic staff is 10,875, while currently there are 6,097 permanent lecturers. There are 4,768 vacancies, but we have recruited 5,236 lecturers on probationary, contract and assignment basis and as visiting lecturers, he explained.
Speaking on the subject of Highways, the minister said that the contracts for all three stages of the Central Expressway were awarded after adhering to proper tender procedure. This was not the practice during the previous regime. No tenders were called for the Southern or Katunayake Expressway and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa selected the contractor, he said.
He said under the Road project, 6,886km of roads would be constructed by the end of 2019.
Solar power generation to reach 1009 MW by 2030: Dy Minister Ajith P. Perera
Under the power generation plan, 1009 MW of solar power is expected to be generated by 2030, while currently, tenders have been called for the establishment of 60 solar power plants, said Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera in Parliament yesterday.
While currently, the lowest power source is solar power, we have provided all facilities to generate solar power by installing solar panels on the roof tops of low income family homes, while providing them the chance to earn an extra income too. There are three methods of solar power generation. Today we celebrate the occasion where 100 MW of solar power is added to the national grid within aa year, he said.
In addition, 51.3 MW of power is being generated by the private sector through seven power stations.
According to the power generation plan, 410 MW of power is expected to be generated by 2020, 685 MW is expected by 2025 and by 2030 1009 MW of solar power is expected to be generated.
Under the solar power plan (Soorya Bala Sangramaya), second stage tenders have been called for the establishment of 60 power stations generating 01 MW each.
By next week, tenders would be called for another 90 power plants generating 01 MW each, said, the Deputy Power and Energy Minister.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said so in response to a verbal question posed by MP Ajith Mannapperuma in Parliament yesterday.

'Supporters of white Van culture have no ethical rights to talk of Treasury bond issue'
State Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim said that those who hid themselves when they were called to the Bribery Commission and supported the white van culture, have no ethical right to talk about the Treasury bond scam.
He said so in Parliament yesterday, in response to the joint opposition objecting to the Speaker appointing a committee to look into whether parliamentary privileges were being violated by exposing telephone records of MPs.
Kabir Hashim further said, Today Udaya Gammanpila is talking about transparency, but earlier, when they were summoned by the Bribery Commission, the MPs went into hiding. They sent letters claiming that there was parliamentary sittings. When information was sought, they sent white vans. Where were you then When your side was doing all this, you did nothing. Now you are trying to talk about transparency
In response, Gammanpila said, We are against appointing a privilege committee over telephone records. Why is the government that brought in the Right to Information, now trying to hide this information
Pitching in on this heated argument, Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said, I said this earlier as well. We are not against investigations. However, we are against Bond Commission evidence being put out without being found guilty.
Meanwhile, Chaminda Wijesiri said, It is a decisive moment for the whole country. Our Prime Minister set an example to the country and to the whole world, that we will not safeguard rogues and fraudsters. The Prime Minister did all he had to do. But the previous government was not like him. When they were summoned before the Bribery Commission, they claimed to have been bitten by a snake and hid. MPs Bandula Gunawardena, Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Ranjith Soysa also joined in the heated argument.

Govt. has focused on human resources development: Minister Wickramaratne
This government unlike the previous govt., has focused on the development of human resources, since it had a direct impact on economic development, said Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne in Parliament yesterday. He added that the previous government had spent mostly on infrastructure development, including roads.
He made this observation in Parliament, joining the Committee Stage Debate on Budget Proposals 2018, under the financial heads of Higher Education and Highways Ministry and Skills Development and Vocational Training Ministry. This government had not promised to provide 1 million employment opportunities, but to create such a number of employment. The Census Department had pointed out that 300,000 employment vacancies have been created during the last two and half years.
Minister Eran Wickramaratne further said that it had been planned to grant 196,000 laptops to school children.
He added that it had also been discussed to provide free Wifi with these laptops for students take the maximum use of them. He also added that 21,000 laptops have already been granted to University students by way of an interest free loan scheme, which is 20 percent of the entire university population.
Intake of university students to increase by 50,000 annually: State Minister Grero
The government has plans to increase the intake of students to universities to 50,000 annually by 2020, said Higher Education State Minister Mohan Lal Grero in Parliament yesterday.
He said the government had been able to increase the intake by 19 percent this year. The government has recruited 30,500 students to universities this year.
He made this observation in Parliament, joining the Committee Stage Debate on Budget Proposals 2018, under the Financial Heads of Higher Education and Highways Ministry and Skills Development and Vocational Training Ministry. He said though this was reality, some groups attempt to charge us that the government was attempting to destroy free education in the country.
"We maintain that facilities in universities was not sufficient and we should take measures to develop them," the State Minister said.
"We also have a mechanism to coordinate the university students with factories, investment projects and mass business institution around universities."
Privilege Committee to look into MP's privileges- Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the matter on whether MPs privileges were being infringed upon by revealing telephone information on the Bond issue investigations, would be put forward to the Privilege Committee.
He made this statement in Parliament yesterday in response to a statement made by Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament on Monday. Accordingly, the Speaker said a meeting with party leaders would be convened and this issue would be discussed at length.

Over 200 fatal accidents last year- Gayantha

He said this in Parliament yesterday in response to an oral question posed by MP Udaya Gammanpila.
He said the number of accidents reported in 2014 were 35,966, in 2015 the recorded number of accidents were 35,160, and in 2016 there were 35,199 accidents that were recorded. The deaths that occurred due to these accidents in 2016 were 3,233, 2,816 in 2015 and 2,240 in 2014.
Jint Opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila asked Minister Karunatillake what the reasons were for these accidents, to which he responded that there were many factors that had contributed to the increase in accidents, including the increase in the number of vehicles,road conditions and the large number of three wheelers in operation.

PM hails Lankas credit upgrade
Sri Lankas recent credit outlook upgrade by an international rating agency is a welcome step for the governments debt-relief programs, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Monday evening.
This is not an occasion to have a party, he said.It just says that our stabilization program is working.
He was addressing a crowded ballroom at the Shangri-La Hotel, for Business Todays Top 30 business awards ceremony. Earlier in the day, the international credit-rating agency Standard and Poors revised its outlook on Sri Lanka from negative to stable.
In a written statement, S&P said they upgraded the countrys status because of the passage of the Inland Revenue Act, and their expectation that that the government will maintain the reform momentum over the next 12 months and smooth the upcoming surge in debt redemption.
But Premier Wickremesinghe urged caution. This is not enough, Ill be the first to say, he said. We have stabilized the economy, (but) how do we go forward
He said that the government is still combing through the debt, looking for dead bodies. He cited recent bills from a Singaporean company for work on the Northern Expressway in 2013 and 2014.
He said they had not been aware of the payment obligation until last week. What had happened in the previous years was that there had been many projects approved which were not shown in the Appropriation Bill, he told the Bond Commission earlier that day.Although S&P said that the trend is positive for Sri Lankas monetary assessment, they warned the country still has a long way to go in reducing debt servicing costs.
Sri Lankas ratio of interest payments to government revenue stands at 36 percent this year, the agency said. Thats the third highest ratio among nations the company rates, behind only Lebanon and Egypt.
But the Prime Minister said he was undeterred. He said the government, as shown through the 2018 budget, is prioritizing growth by fueling the private sector.
For me there is only one path, he said. And that is to crawl our way back to the top. See page v

You and I will remain till the end of our days in two opposing political parties, but there can be no disagreement when the Vision is to build a better country for all Sri Lankans, a country where Freedom, human decency and honest, pro people governance will reign supreme. Wish you much strength and courage!
Building a just society and good governance -Ven. Dambara Amila Thera
This is what we expected to build a just society and good governance. It is a historic moment in the country and I would say even Asia that a sitting Premier under whose government the Commission functions in, voluntarily comes before them to provide evidence, states National Movement for Social Justice Convenor Ven. Dambara Amila Thera.
Ven.Dambara Amila said:It shows that the law is equal to all and sets a good precedence. It shows that whether you are a monk, politician or Prime Minister, you have to adhere to the law- it is above all.
We respect the Prime Minister for doing such a thing and as people who helped bring the Yahapalana government into power, We are very happy with what he did, the Thera said.
An example to country - Lakshman Yapa
Public Enterprise Development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has set an example to the country by personally appearing before the Commission of Inquiry into the Treasury Bond Issue on Monday.
His initiative to go before the Commission shows that the country has witnessed political change,he said. The Prime Minister could have given the testimony in a form of affidavit without appearing before the Commission in person. But, he appeared before the Commission. This is what the people of this country expected by electing the new Government in 2015.
First steps towards changing political culture - Viyangoda
Puravesi Balaya Convenor Gamini Viyangoda said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe took the first step towards changing the political culture of the country. None of the previous leaders appeared for an inquiry or to give an explanation. During the previous regime, not even a Provincial Councilor or Pradeshya Sabha member was brought before the law.
The Prime Minister is an exemplary figure to all politicians, when he was requested to appear at the Bond Commission, he willingly agreed to appear. As the Prime Minister of the country, he could have refrained from appearing before the Commission, but he did not do that,Viyangoda said.
The Bond Commission does not come to an end with this but he helped the Commission to clarify some of the missing details. The Prime Minister proved to the country that he was not involved, however, legal action should be taken against the perpetrators who were involved in the Bond scam.

Probe them all
Leader of the House, Minister Lakshman Kiriella, on Monday, raised a privilege issue, in parliament, pertaining to the recording of telephone calls of members of the COPE, which investigated the alleged Central Bank bond scam. He wanted Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to call for a party leaders meeting, to discuss the matter, and, summon all parties responsible, including the MPs, whose names were mentioned, in the alleged transactions.
Moving a Motion, in House, Minister Kiriella said, a forensic report, prepared by the CID, which was presented to the Bond Commission, on November 16, contained details of telephone calls of 28 members, of which five MPs had received telephone calls from Arjun Aloysious, both, during, and, outside the COPE investigations, into the alleged bond racket.
Kiriella also made the pertinent point, that, even if Aloysious had contacted the five members concerned (for a cover up), he had failed in the bid, with COPE unanimously deciding on action against the wrongdoers. He also made the point that the Bond Commission was not a court of law, with punitive powers, and, that, no one had been found guilty, in connection with any offence. In this light, on what basis had the CID taken the liberty to record the telephone calls of the MPs On whose instructions, and, for what purpose were tabs kept on telephone calls, especially of these MPs
Expanding, the Minister said, it was an inviolable right of MPs to have telephone contact with their constituents and vice versa, and, the telephone has been identified as a means that constituents communicate with MPs.
True, as the Minister maintained, what the Bond Commission is conducting is an inquiry, as against an investigation, that may be carried out by an official investigating arm, of the police. In the case of the Thajudeen murder, what was being carried out was an investigation, following the High Court ruling, that the death of the former Rugby captain, was, indeed, a murder, though, it was made to appear, as an accident. Hence, the CID was legally empowered to obtain all relevant material, including telephone conversions and text messages, which it had done. This action can hardly be deemed an invasion of one's privacy.
Has some official of the AG's Department, overcome by zeal, overstepped the bounds of his official duties, in making inroads into the privacy of members of parliament Kiriella has asked the Speaker to summon all actors, for an inquiry in this regard. Hence, no doubt, things are bound to unravel, in all their details.
It has to be mentioned here, that, certain State Counsel, in the AG's Department, to put it mildly, had been spoiling for a fight, from the day the Bond Commission inquiry commenced. Their hostility towards witnesses was amply in evidence, particularly, during the grilling of former minister, Ravi Karunanayake.
Perhaps, they may have been buoyed by the lift given to them by certain media, backing the Rajapaksas, with terms such as inteprid being used to describe counsels daring. No such panache, though, were in evidence to describe officials of the FCID, after a string of arrests were made, of former Rajapaksa cronies, for large scale corruption. To these newspapers, the officers of the FCID, were, the Gestapo of the government.
Be that as it may, there is no reason for the government to paint itself into a corner, and, be on the defensive, in this whole matter. We say this because, several MPs, whose names transpired in the Aloysious connection, are, these days, going to great lengths, striving to explain matters, in their defence. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has set the record straight, and, explained away all the grey areas, in the whole bond auction matter. In the process, he has also unraveled the blatant irregularities, in the earlier bond auctions, under the Rajapaksa regime, which sent trillions of rupees down the drain.
Hence, assuming there had been an irregularity, under the current dispensation, it could only be the tip of the iceberg. UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri, called on the government to commence investigations into all bond auctions, from 2008, and, that, several government MPs, at the time, were close buddies of Arjun Aloysious, who is the villain of the piece today.
It is in this light, that, the call made by MP Buddhika Pathirana, to launch inquiries into the telephone records of all 225 MPs, should be considered. Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera admitted that Aloysious helped him during his election campaign to be Chief Minister, which was in the year 2012. Sarath Fonseka, too, revealed that he received Rs. 100,000, during his Presidential Election campaign, in 2010. It has also recently transpired, that, Namal Rajapaksa, even attended the wedding of Arjun Aloysious, and, the sister of the former Central Bank governor, Ajith Nivard Cabraal, was a director, at Perpetual Treasuries.
Hence, it is reasonable to assume, that, links existed between prominent members of the Rajapaksa regime, and, Arjun Aloysious, which, they are today trying to suppress by drawing a red herring, taking cover under the current imbroglio.
