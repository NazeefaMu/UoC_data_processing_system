Tick fever
Tick fever may be a life threatening disease condition. Ticks are parasites that attach themselves to dogs, feed on blood and transmit diseases directly into the dogs system. Major tick-borne diseases include: Lyme disease, Canine Ehrlichiosis, Canine Anaplasmosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Canine Babesiosis, Canine Bartonellosis, Canine Hepatozoonosis. Tick-borne disease can be transmitted within 3 - 6 hours of a tick bite. Fortunately, however, a dog who recovers from Tick Fever can go on to lead a normal, healthy life, as long as he doesnt become reinfected from the bite of another infected tick.
Susceptible breeds
Interestingly, German Shepherds, Pomeranian, Japanese spits and Doberman Pinschers seem to have more severe reactions to Tick Fever, and have a poorer prognosis.
Spread
The tick fever spread via ticks. Sadly, it only takes a single bite for a dog to become infected. When ticks feed on an animal infected with tick fever they also become infected. The parasite can remain alive in the tick for up to 5 or 6 months before being passed on to another dog.
Systems affected
The parasite damages the red blood cells of the dogs which are responsible of transport oxygen, nutrients around dogs body and finally organs like liver, kidney and spleen.
Signs
The animal gets lethargy, do not eat, high fever, pale gums, inactive, might pant and yellow colour skin. The urine is dark brown or red colour.Swollen legs, depression and tender abdomen are usually due to an enlarged liver, Kidney problems. Neurological issues and bone marrow failure are common signs of the disease
Diagnosis
Veterinarians recommend that if you see an engorged tick (one that is full of blood) on your dog, you should have your dog tested for Tick Fever around eight weeks after finding and removing the tick. The blood test can be done by any animal clinic in Sri Lanka. The test is very simple and quick. The vet takes a drop of blood from the tip of the ear of your dogs for this test. But the sad part is the result may be negative at early 2-3 days of infection.
Treatment
Early detection and treatment can greatly improve dogs chances of surviving Tick Fever. Anti parasitic drugs will be given by the vet to destroy the parasite with the supportive treatment to regain the blood of your dog. Dogs that are experiencing severe bleeding problems may need IV fluids and a blood transfusion. When the condition of the animal is okay for oral medication the vet will recommend medicine which is usually given for 3 weeks to several months.
Prevention
Bi annual screening for tick disease is a vital component of your pets annual veterinary exam. There are several methods of prevention and no method offers 100 percent protection.
Check your dog for ticks daily
Brush your fingers through its fur, applying enough pressure to feel any small to large tick which will be vary in size, from a pinhead to a pea. Legs, paws, arm pits ears, root of the tail are the places you should pay more attention in searching ticks in your dogs body. If you find a tick remove it immediately.
Collar
Collar which is medicated with tick repellent are available in the market which can be wear on your dogs neck. But make sure to remove it when you bath the dog.
Vaccine
Vaccines are available at most of the vet clinics should be given for young animals.
Tablets
Tablets present in the market with tick repellent medicine should give repeatedly according to the manufacturers recommendation. One should keep in mind to match the tablet exactly to the weight of your dog.
Spot on
Spot on medicine comes as drops which can be place on the back of the dog from neck to root of the tail drop by drop. This medicine also should match with the weight of your dog.
Spray
Tick repellent drugs can be spray on the coat of the dog. There are some sprays which can be used in the kennel, yard and any field your dog use generally.
Managing tick fever infected dog
Dogs who receive treatment early usually show improvement within 24 to 48 hours after starting treatment. For dogs in the chronic phase, it can take up to several months for them to visibly recover. Foods that support regain the blood is highly recommended. Resting in comfortable place is suitable for quick recovery. A dog in recovery may appear to be doing well but that doesn't mean that his body is ready for it yet. When your dog has been sick, he needs time to recover and rebuild strength. To further protect your dog, remain vigilant with regular blood work to detect recurrences.
Humans and Tick Fever
The good news is you cant catch Tick fever directly from your dog. However, you can catch it if an infected tick bites you, so keeping ticks off your dog will not only protect him, but will help protect you as well.

UPFA will amend or do away  with 19th Amendment - John
UPFA Parliamentarian John Seneviratne yesterday said that they would either bring amendments to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution or do away with it under their government.
Seneviratne added that the 19th Constitutional Amendment has led to the present unstable situation in the country as it was targeted to remove several individuals of the UPFA Government including former Minister Basil Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa from the political arena.There were provisions in this Constitutional Amendment which helped UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe to stay in power without any obstacle,he said.
Speaking at a press conference at the SLPP office in Battaramulla, he said the UNP government was in the process of drafting a new Constitution to suit the needs of foreign powers.
During the last phase of the war on terrorism, our government faced stiff pressure from foreign countries to stop military operations. But, our leaders did not give into such pressure and defeated one of the most ruthless terrorist outfits in the world, Seneviratne said.
The Parliamentarian added how representatives of foreign missions in Colombo had arrived at the Parliamentary complex on November 14 and 15, when the session was in progress.
The Speaker and the UNP leaders are working hand in hand with the diplomatic missions in Colombo to create an opinion in the international arena that undemocratic activities are taking place in Sri Lanka after former President Mahinda Rajapaksa took oaths as the Prime Minister, Senviratene said.
The UNP and the foreign missions want to establish an opinion internationally that Sri Lankan authorities are violating the constitution and the democratic rights of the people have been denied, he said.
Seneviratne believed that this situation can be solved through an election and people of all nooks and corner are also of the view that an election is the only way out of this mess.
There was no timeframe for the dissolution of Parliament initially and the Prime Minister can inform the Governor if he or she wishes to dissolve Parliament, he added.
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike dissolved Parliament twice making use of this provision in the Constitution.
He said that former President J.R. Jayewardene included a clause in the 1978 Constitution through which Parliament cannot be dissolved when it completes one year.But under the 19th Amendment, this time period extended upto four and half years.
The Attorney General making submission in the Supreme Court on Wednesday stressed that the Presidents power to dissolve Parliament has been ensured under the 33th and the 62 the articles of the Constitution.
The dissolution of Parliament by the President is in conformity with the Constitution. JRJ wanted a weak Parliament and a strong Executive. Today the government is trying to strengthen Parliament to create problems with the Executive, he said.
Seneviratne added that Parliament deviated from the centuries old traditions and norms when new session commenced after the prorogation.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had said that he did not accept the letter sent by the President on November 14. He cannot ignore a letter sent by the Executive, he added.
Seneviratne added that he (Speaker) could have adjourned the Parliament after inaugural session. He has no authority to take up another subject for debate on this day, he said
He said that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that a No confidence Motion against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaska would be taken up for debate on the same day in contravention of Parliamentary traditions and norms.
The Speaker did not follow the proper procedure when taking up the NCM against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa in Parliament. The Prime Minister and other Members of Parliament should be informed about the charges included in the NCM before it is taken up for debate.
He added that an Opposition MP cannot bring in a proposal aimed at suspending the Standing Orders in Parliament. Such a proposal should be brought in by a Government Member in Parliament, he said.

A Vote on Account will fill  the breach - Bandula
There is no issue with regard to financial management of the country as there is a provision in the constitution to allocate money through a Vote on Account, Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena said.
He was addressing the media along with Parliamentarians Laksman Yapa Abeywardena and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa yesterday in Colombo.
Gunawardena added that there are provisions for the President to allocate money when Parliament is dissolved. However, if Parliament is continuing, money can be allocated through a Vote on Account for a three month period.
Gunawardena further said the UNP Parliamentarians are circulating falsehoods that the salaries of public servants cannot be paid from January. Besides, they say that loan instalments, Samurdhi benefits, pensions and other welfare payments cannot be paid as the government has no powers to allocate funds. Gunawardena highlighted that there is no truth in that because the funds can be allocated by a Vote on Account for a period of three months of next year.
According to state monetary regulations, there is no issue until December 31, he said. He further added that even if a new government is elected, the President has powers to allocate money for a three month period until a budget is presented. Moreover, the President has powers to allocate money even for a holding an election.
The new government was about to present a vote on Account of Rs 1,735 and the proposal of presenting Vote on Account received Cabinet approval also, he added.
Everyone should support a Vote on Account Bill in Parliament if it is presented. Otherwise, no Parliamentarians, who dont support to pass it, can go to their electorates and face people, he said.
The UNP is threatening public servants who carry out their duties. It is an injustice to threaten public servants swho carry out their duties, he added Parliamentarian Anura Priayadarshana Yapa addressing the media said public servants should not fear carrying out their duties ortop release funds within the provisions of government regulations. He added that the 19th amendment has created a huge mess.
The UNP wanted to transfer powers of the Executive President to the Prime Minister through the back door implementing the 19th Amendment. But, instead of strengthening the Prime Minister, the powers of Parliament was reduced with the 19th amendment, he said. Once we come to power, measures will be taken to revise the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, he added.

Ton-up Williamson foils Pakistan:
Yasir -Shah breaks 82-year record
Abu Dhabi, Thursday: Record-breaking Yasir Shah had to share the days honours with New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson on Thursday as the third and final Test heads towards a gripping final day in Abu Dhabi.
The early part of the morning belonged to Yasir who collected the one wicket he needed to become the fastest man to reach 200 wickets in Test cricket.
The rest of the day, however, belonged to Williamson who played a masterly innings, and was 139 not out as the Kiwis reached 272-4 by the close. Williamson had great support from Henry Nicholls who made 90 not out during an unbroken fifth wicket partnership of 212 that has given New Zealand a lead of 198 with six wickets remaining.
With the series tied at 1-1, the final day of this last Test promises to be fascinating with both sides capable of winning.
The day began in high anticipation with New Zealand resuming at 26-2 and Yasir taking the ball to bowl the third over.
He needed just one wicket to break a record set 82 years ago by the great Australian leg-spinner Clarrie Grimmett who had needed 36 Tests to reach the milestone of 200 Test wickets.
When Yasir trapped nightwatchman Will Somerville leg before for four with his 13th delivery of the day, he reached the 200-wicket mark in just his 33rd Test.
Ever since I knew this record it became my dream to take fastest 200 wickets and it came true today, said Yasir, who still hopes Pakistan can pull off a win.
The wicket is slow but it is turning from the patches. We want to bowl them and try to go for the chase. That is what we are going to try as there is still one full day left in the match.
Pakistan had hopes of an emphatic win once Shaheen Shah Afridi had Ross Taylor caught hooking for 22 with the total at 60-4.
But they were undone by Williamsons masterclass and an innings from Nicholls that grew in confidence but, like his partner, enjoyed a touch of luck.
The key moment for Pakistan in the field came when Yasir dropped Williamson on 87 off Bilal Asif when he failed to catch a full blooded pull at square-leg. Williamson, who scored 89 in the first innings, drove medium pacer Hasan Ali to the cover boundary for his 12th four to complete a well deserved 19th Test century -- his second against Pakistan. Nicholls also survived a loud leg-before appeal off Yasir when on three, but Pakistan erred by not reviewing the not-out decision as the ball tracker showed it would have hit the leg stump. AFP

Zam Gems expands in Sri Lanka
Zam Gems, an internationally reputed name in the gem and jewellery industry, has become synonymous with Trust and Confidence among their plethora of loyal clients.
In the early 1980s we purchased a company called Siri Gems with a branch at the then Oberoi Hotel, now the Cinnamon Grand Hotel. From there onwards we got into the Colombo Hilton and in 1990s we opened the Head Office Showroom in Bambalapitiya, a branch in Kandy and at Cinnamon Lakeside, and now we have twelve showrooms in Sri Lanka, and hope to further increase this number in the future, said Zam Gems Managing Director and newly appointed Chairman of Sri Lanka Gems & Jewellery Association, Ashan Refai.
The Zam Gems Sales Team is a highly trained and could advise clients on how to detect hues, tones and saturations, ensuring you receive the finest stones, free of blemishes, he said.
Sri Lanka is also targeting the gem and jewellery industry as a billion dollar industry which could be achieved easily.
In 1976 the company was officially incorporated and we became an export-oriented company. With the boom experienced by the country in the 1970s and 1980s, the responses received by Zam Gems were enormous. Especially with the Japanese and the American markets at that time, my father was soon able to become one of the leading gem and jewelry exporters.
Thereafter we diversified into jewellery manufacturing and retailing in the late 1980s. The first Zam Gems showroom was established on the Macan Markar Arcade at Galle Face called El Dorado.

Presidential, general elections on one day will resolve crisis
Holding the Presidential and General Elections at the same time is the sole option to identify the mandate of the people, Campaign for Free and Fair Election (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said.
He was addressing the media at his office in Rajagiriya yesterday.
Tennakoon said that the things done by the President recently questioned whether the mandate given to the President in 2015 is still valid. The people are speaking today against him.
Those who are supporting him now were in other factions who refused him then. Therefore, there is an issue of the validity of the mandate given to him, he said.
UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe hired candidates when he was unable to win an election. Though it matches with their party politics, it is not suitable for the countrys democracy, he said.
He said that if the court ruling on the petitions on dissolution of Parliament received by Monday positively, a general election can be held by the second week of February. President Mathiripala Sirisenas term in office completes four years by January 9, 2019. The President also can go for a Presidential election after four years. Therefore, it is possible to hold both elections together and recheck the mandate, he said.
He said that due to the political situation in the country, holding the two elections separately could change the results of each election artificially. It is because one faction is asking for a general election and the other for a Presidential election.
Tennakoon said the Provincial Council election has been delayed for 15 months. President Maithripala Sirisena, then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, then Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapa and the political parties representing Parliament should hold the responsibility for the delay. Running the Provincial Councils under public officials for a long time is autocratic, he said.
He requested to hold the Provincial Council election together with these two elections to end the issue.
The Executive Director said the current political scenario has weakened the entire country, day-to-day activities of the people and the public administration.

In a strange quirk of fate, no university pedagogue, member of the academia or private sector trade chamber, has yet undertaken an in depth investigation of the economic opportunity cost of the ongoing constitutional, political imbroglio, which has engulfed the nation for well over the last five weeks.
None of the frontline university pedagogues, trade chambers or for that matter any economic virtuoso were able to comment following Daily News Business venturing out to determine the opportunity cost of the current political, constitutional impasse.
Colombo University Professor of Economics Prof. Sirimal Abeyratne, a well known exponent of Macro Economics, told Daily News Business yesterday that his University had not yet undertaken a survey of that nature yet and was unable to comment on the issue at all.
President of the Sri Lanka Economists Association, Dr. Upananda Vidanapathirana, himself a former Assistant to the Governor of the Central Bank and a former Industries Ministry Secretary also told Daily News Business that his association had not yet undertaken a similar study on the opportunity costs of the current crisis. May be this would come at a later stage when everything is finally over, he said.
Meanwhile, none of the frontline private sector trade chambers, despite a face to face meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena on Monday, to air their grievances on the current impasse, had also had undertaken a similar study.
The CEO of Sri Lankas umbrella private sector lobby group  the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Dhara Wijeyetilleke also confirmed to Daily News Business that a study of that nature has not been undertaken as of yet.
Meanwhile, unconfirmed social media reports speculated last week that the consolidated losses to the economy was a whopping Rs. 720 billion and could have been well past the magical Rs. 1 Trillion mark by now.
Tea export prices are also declining presently and there had been an impact on tourist arrivals as well, despite the quantum of the damage had not been ascertained yet, sources confirmed.

## Title: Armys role in rebuilding the North

Armys role in rebuilding the North
Since the end of the war in 2009, the Sri Lanka Army has played a significant role in the rebuilding, resettlement and reconciliation process, especially in the North. The most recent contribution by the Army to rebuilding efforts in the North, was the renovation and expansion of the Valavilkulam tank in Vadukkoddai in Jaffna. This tank, which supplied water to many agricultural fields of the area, had been abandoned and neglected for many years.
The Army took the initiative to expand and renovate the tank using Army labour following a request made by Dr. Sidambaran Mohan, the President of the Friends of Jaffna Organisation and the Farmers Society of Vadukkoddai- Southwest, from the Commander, Security Forces - Jaffna, Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi. The completely renovated tank was handed over to the farming community in the area on Sunday, December 2. This is just the latest of the efforts taken by the Sri Lanka Army to assist the Northern people to get back on their feet after having suffered for almost 30 years of conflict.
Reaching into young minds
All Army chiefs who were in Jaffna including Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake, who served as the Security Force Headquarters -Jaffna Commander, prior to being appointed as the Army Commander, had worked tirelessly to rebuild the North and assisted the people to get back to their normal lives. Major General Hettiarachchi since having taken over as the Jaffna Commander, had initiated many programmes for the war-afftected people of the North and has played an active role in assisting government officials in their rebuilding and other service projects.
Speaking to the Daily News, Jaffna Security Force Headquarters Commander Maj. Gen. Dharshana Hettiarachchi outlined the assistance rendered to the people by the military.
During the three decades of war in the North and East, properties and other infrastructure were severely damaged. As the Army, we have implemented and planned a number of projects to uplift the living standards of the people and also to assist children with their studies, with a view of guiding them through proper education. Hence, in one such endeavour, during the past years, we have awarded almost 500 scholarships to students who were selected from low income families of the area. We have also distributed approximately 550 bicycles among those students. We mainly focus on these schoolchildren because we feel that they are the ones that need to be educated as they can bring back the golden era of outstanding skills which they lost during the past 30 years. So, we wanted to target these schoolchildren and give them the opportunity to pursue their education with all the facilities. It is sometimes hard to change the mindset of the grown-ups, who tend to always look at such assistance with suspicion. These scholarships are provided especially by the Southern people of the country. Hence, with the assistance of the Southern people, we wish to create a bridge of friendship between them, dispelling all animosity and suspicion, he said. He hopes that one day these children from the North will remember the support given by the Southern people in their studies, while believing that this is a good step to foster reconciliation.
Helping the poor
Apart from helping students, the military has engaged in another project which constructs houses for homeless people with the assistance of the Southern people. Maj. Gen. Hettiarachchi said that, apart from the assistance in construction activities, they had planted 30,000 coconut saplings, during the past eight months, on lands occupied by the Army. In addition, 20,000 coconut saplings have been distributed among low income families as a supplementary income source for them.
Under our ongoing project, We have also planted about 15,000 native plants of the area in our reforestation drive. The Army is also engaged in a coast conservation project to protect the coasts in the Jaffna peninsula.
Based on statistics of the Jaffna GAs office, the Army has learnt that there are around 10,000 families in the district without proper sanitary facilities. The military intends to provide proper toilet facilities for the low income families in the North with donations from the South.
However, the Jaffna Commander pointed that the Tamil Diaspora is not involved in rebuilding the North and appealed to assist especially the students with their educational activities in order to help them come up in life.
With regard to the land issues in the North, Maj. Gen. Hettiarachchi said that during the last few years, they had released a considerable number of lands to their owners in the North and they will continue that process.
We will release the rest of the lands as well. We know that there are some people who have been living in welfare centres for over 28 years. The war ended in 2009 and still we have not been able to close down those welfare centres due to the land issues. Hence, we will try our best to release these lands to their owners without compromising on security. However, despite a presidential order to shift all military camps from occupied lands, the Army might need some time in order to put up required structures to facilitate our troops, he noted.
Contributions by the military
Meanwhile, Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray commenting on the assistance rendered by the military in carrying out reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation efforts in the North, said the sacrifices made by the security forces to end the war is a well-known fact.
Even after the war ended, the security forces are still sacrificing a lot in order to ensure the safety of the people in the North and even in their rebuilding efforts. As the Governor, I am very happy with the service they provide me in performing my duties and responsibilities. Their service is immense and immeasurable. The assistance given by the military in terms of uplifting living and economic standards of the people during disasters etc. is invaluable. The tri forces have proved that they are golden assets to me. They protect the land, sea and sky. Even the Navy renders a great service in preventing illegal drugs being brought into the country by the sea and they also work tirelessly to prevent illegal fishing taking place in the Northern seas.
He noted that even when the people in this region fall sick and need blood transfusions for various illnesses, 90% of the blood donated to the Jaffna Hospital is by the security forces. The villagers hesitate to donate blood, but according to Buddhism, it is meritorious to donate ones blood to a one in need.
Another issue in the reconstruction and development efforts in this region, is the lack of manpower and physical resources. In some instances, even contractors who take on these contracts abandon the projects halfway and leave. However, it is the military that comes forward and completes these constructions efficiently and quickly with low cost. It is cheaper to get the military involved in construction as there is no labour cost involved because they provide the labour without any charge. In terms of housing projects, the military does a good job in constructing cheap and attractive, but solid houses and that is a boost to reconciliation as well.
The military helps the Northern people during their religious festivals. It is the military who draws the Veil chariot at the Mavattikulam Kovil festival as well. The military is also engaged in renovation and construction of kovils in the North under a special project. Further, the church in the Kachchathivu Island was completely renovated and reconstructed by the Navy. Even at private weddings and funerals of the northern villages, it is the army that helps them the most in numerous ways. Therefore, the people in this area are living in harmony with the military personnel.
The Jaffna Government Agent (GA) / District Secretary N. Vethanayahan noted that, after the end of the war, the reconstruction and resettlement activities have been expedited. Many lands have also been released which was previously occupied by the military and they have assisted in the resettlement as well. Many housing projects have been initiated and displaced persons are being resettled. Main roads and other interior roads are being repaired and some new roads have been constructed. The North is developing very rapidly. The Army is very helpful in many ways in terms of reconstruction and they have done a great service in constructing houses for the displaced. Most recently, 135 houses were constructed in Nallanagapuram and Keerimalai. In addition to these houses, the Army is helping the people who are unable to construct their houses even in other areas. The Army is providing skilled and unskilled labour for the construction which is a very positive move and is a great step towards reconciliation.
In addition, the military is engaged in many social activities which provide assistance to schoolchildren with their educational activities. Some of these families find it hard to provide the facilities for their children to continue with schooling and the Army has stepped in and is assisting by providing scholarships and school equipment for these children.
He also explained that the military had also rendered their assistance in dengue control programmes as well. They also assist us in many environmental programmes and their services are very much needed during the times of disasters or environmental calamities. They are the first on site to assist. Whoever the Army Commander is, they are always ready to assist us in serving the people. In fact, they come forward and volunteer their services without waiting for our request.
In terms of housing projects, we initially offered the funds to the recipients to construct their houses, but they could not do it. At that time, we contacted the Army and they came forward to help us complete the construction of these houses. In fact, we provided Rs. 800,000 for the construction of a house and they were able to complete these houses only with the Armys labour assistance.
Whatever service the Jaffna people need, the GA said that as they have a good rapport with the military, they can readily call on the military for the assistance and they will never back off and will always be ready to assist.

Whatever people may say about the current situation in the country the best solution to the current problem is to hold a General Election soon, Ven. Anamaduwe Dhammadassi, Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter said.
He said everyone was clamouring for a General Election today and even Ranil Wickremesinghe had stated that it was better to hold a General Election soon after the setting up of a lawful government. The Anunayake Thera said there would not be any upheavals within the next week since the President had promised to resolve the existing political problems within a week and Parliamentary sessions had also been postponed by a week.
He said even though the UNP had created a din in Parliament, it had lost mass support among the public.
The people need not be disturbed about the existing crisis since the administration was engaged in finding plausible solutions to it.
He said the current period was an extraordinary one which would go down in the countrys history because the country was governed by a single ruler for the first time after the period of the Sinhala Kings. He said the President seemed to be finding pragmatic solutions to problems.

## Title: Balancing overlapping powers of executive, legislature and judiciary

Balancing overlapping powers of executive, legislature and judiciary
Democracy, which is described as the best out of the available inadequate systems of governance, could survive when the three branches, the executive, legislature and judiciary consensually enjoy the assigned authority vested under the system of separation of powers, while zealously safeguarding their own power centres.
There is no denying that the judiciary, as the conflict resolution mechanism in a democratic polity, needs to be upright and unfettered. There is wisdom and circumspection in the speech of Indias first Prime Minister Jawarharlal Nehru on May 24, 1949 when he stated in the Constituent Assembly that the judges should be first-rate men of the highest integrity who could stand up against the executive government and whoever may come in their way.
This is equally relevant to Sri Lanka, where the citizens await one of the most important judgements that would have a lasting impact not only on the relations between the three arms of state, but also the future of the country.
The intent of separation of powers between executive, legislature and judiciary is to prevent the concentration of unchecked power by providing for checks and balances to avoid autocracy, over-reaching by one branch over another, and the attending efficiency of governing by one actor without need for negotiation and compromise with any other.
Separation of powers, therefore, refers to the division of responsibilities into distinct branches to limit any one branch from exercising the core functions of another.
Although the 1978 Constitution gave immunity to the Executive, President Maithripala Sirisena voluntarily surrendered that privilege. Clause 35 of the Constitution says, While any person holds office as President, no proceedings shall be instituted or continued against him in any court or tribunal in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by him either in his official or private capacity.
Executive Presidency
The absolute immunity of Executive Presidency was withdrawn in the 19th Amendment. However, it has not changed the clause 126 of the Constitution, which has laid down certain limitations to the courts. It says, The Supreme Court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any question relating to the infringement or imminent infringement by Executive or administrative action of any fundamental right or language right.
Under the separation and balancing of power, the three branches have been vested with authority. They should exercise these authority with extreme care and ensure they do not infringe into each others territories.
Judiciary, as one of the most important features of democracy and it is responsible for safeguarding the interests and the fundamental rights of the people. Judiciary consists of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, High Court and other lower courts. Judiciary keeps a tab on the activities of the government and plays an important role in the event of violation of Fundamental Rights of the people of the country. Judiciary also has the authority to examine the validity of the Laws enacted by the Parliament on the constitutional parameters.
The people have the highest expectations of the judiciary, and Judges rights. They are guaranteed by the Constitution. The Constitution gives special emphasis and protection for the judicial independence, Judges and the system of Justice. Independence of the Judges and judiciary should be real and not merely apparent safeguards in which guarantees is zealously guarded by all.
It is vitally important in a democracy that individual judges and the judiciary as a whole are impartial and independent of all external pressures and of each other so that those who appear before them and the wider public can have confidence that their cases will be decided fairly and in accordance with the law.
Political controversies
The reliance on the courts and on judicial means for addressing political controversies and public policy questions is arguably one of the most important functions in sustenance of democracy. The Supreme Courts worldwide have been frequently asked to resolve a range of issues pertaining to constitutional ambiguities, varying from the scope of expression and religious liberties, privacy freedoms, equality rights and public policies. The increasing political importance of courts has not only become more globally widespread than ever before.
In the past, we have seen ugly scenes such as stone throwing at the houses of judges who had given a verdict that was not seen as favourable to a ruling party. Now when we are at the threshold of an important judgement, we have to understand the importance of judicial independence, which is the principle that the Judiciary should be politically independent from legislature and Executive Authority. Courts should not be influenced by any political authority or external influence.
Judges need to be respected for their role, which is exercising judgement. Their function is to interpret and apply the law. It is the function of the Parliament to make the law. Constantly questioning a judges capacity to interpret law is akin to constantly questioning the legitimacy of politicians to even make any law in the first place. If a politician decides to take a few politically opportunistic potshots at a group of judges it will not result in crashing of our democratic state. However, the political leadership should ensure that any attack on judiciary should construed as an attack on our democratic foundation, which we cherish.

Banking and insurance sector earnings continue to grow  in September 2018 quarter
Banking sector earnings posted a +14% YoY growth to Rs. 17.7 billion while continuing to be the largest contributor to overall earnings according to a review was prepared and issued by First Capital Holdings PLC based on information in the public domain, internally developed and other sources.
Commercial, HNB and Sampath Bank being the largest banks in terms of the asset base contributed 72% to total banking sector earnings. Improved earnings during the quarter was resultant to higher interest rates prevailed in the market thereby improving margins and spreads which negated the effect of increase in impairment provisioning under IFRS 9.
Meanwhile a two-fold growth was also witnessed in the insurance sector earnings. This was owing to phenomenal growth in earnings of Union Assurance (Rs 1.6 billion) and Asian Alliance Insurance PLC (Rs. 2.3 billion) resultant to the reversal in deferred tax assets in life insurance business.
However September quarter food and beverage sector earnings dipped by 10% YoY to Rs. 54.3 billion primarily owing to sluggish performance in Food, Beverage and Tobacco (-31%YoY), Telecommunication (-36%YoY) and Materials (-68%YoY) sectors which outweighed the positive momentum experienced by Banks (+14%YoY) and Insurance (+217%YoY) sectors.

## Title: Be healthy and sportive
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Friday, December 7, 2018 - 01:00
Be healthy and sportive
1. Healthy Eating
Good nutrition means eating a variety of foods. Many people get stuck in a routine of eating the same five to ten staple foods over and over again: pasta, bananas, bagels, chicken, carrot sticks and lettuce salad. But we need to mix things up a little.
Remember the 80-20 rule: Eat well at least 80 percent of the time but leave some room for soul nourishment and pure pleasure. If youre going to ingest foods or drinks that offer little nutritional value -such as coffee, beer, jelly beans, pop, sugary cakes and so on, make the indulgence worthwhile. If the food offers no nutritional value at least aim to get maximum psychological pleasure out of it.
2. Energy Management
Eat 3 meals a day with the largest portion being vegetables or fruit but also ensure you add some lean protein. A minimum of 3 of the 4 food groups is ideal. This ensures you get adequate protein and enough carbohydrate to fuel your muscles and brain.
Eat 2 or 3 healthy snacks each day. Dont allow more than 4 hours to pass in a day without eating.
3. Hydration
Stay well hydrated: Drink water with all meals and snacks, anything sweet or salty and in a 1:1 ratio with caffeine, alcohol or pop. Youll know you are well hydrated when you go pee every 1-2 hours during the day and your urine is clear or pale in colour.
Drink before, during and after exercise
4. Pre-exercise Eating
Eat a smart dinner the night before - lots of vegetables, grains and some lean protein - for example - vegetable-tofu stir fry over brown rice, vegetable-laden sauce with 3-4 oz chicken or lean meat over pasta, bean and vegetable soup with whole grain bread, fish, vegetables and brown rice.
Have a high carbohydrate evening snack to top up muscle glycogen stores, especially if you cant eat breakfast. Some examples include: fruit, a bagel with jam, popcorn or cinnamon toast.
The morning of: Aim for a breakfast with mostly carbohydrate but also a bit of protein for staying power. Keep this meal low in fat and moderate in fibre. The more time you have between eating and exercise, the larger the quantity you can eat.
5. Recovery
Focus on rehydration - drink at least another 2-4 cups of water
Eat or drink carbohydrate foods within the first 30 minutes of finishing a hard workout or activity - e.g. fruit, vegetables, yogurt, a bagel, cereal and milk or a typical lunch meal. Continue to eat every 2 - 4 hours.
If you drink caffeine, alcohol or pop, drink extra water.
6. Eating on the Road
Fast food is still, for the most part, much too high in fat, very high in sodium and often served in gargantuan portions. Instead, look for meals with large portions of vegetables or fruit.
Pack high quality, healthy snacks to take with you on the road. Dont use a trip as an excuse to blow your healthy eating plan.
7. Weight Management
Do not obsess about weight!
Pay attention to hunger and satiety cues - tune into meal volume, timing and spacing
Dont approach every meal like its your last opportunity ever to eat. Rate your fullness on a scale of 1-10 where 1 is starving and 10 is over full. Try to stop at level 5. This is the point where you feel psychologically and physiologically satisfied, but not stuffed.
8. Supplementation
Supplements are not replacements for food, dont be fooled by advertising hype
Sport drinks, bars and gels have a role to play. Realize, though that they are generally designed for use during prolonged exercise. The main benefit of sport drinks is that their flavours, bright colours and jazzy packaging remind athletes to drink more fluids when exercising.
9. Vegetarianism
s a vegetarian, you need to replace the meat portion of your diet with a variety of healthy meat alternatives such as beans, lentils, chickpeas, tofu and other soy products, nuts, nut butters, seeds, and eggs, dairy and fish (if you eat them)
If you eliminate dairy products as well, you need to consider calcium and vitamin D, and when you eliminate all foods of animal origin, vitamin B12 also needs special attention.
10. Food Safety and Quality Concerns
Although organic food may not necessarily offer higher nutritional value, certified organic foods will reduce your intake of pesticides and other chemicals. In this regard, extra cost is still worth it.
Organic or not, washing of all produce is still critical to minimizing food poisoning.

An outline on the legal issues relating to the dissolution of parliament:
Between the policy and the law
Continued from yesterday
INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES 70(1) AND 33(2)
The main articles relating to dissolution of Parliament of Sri Lanka are contained in article 70(1) and 33(2) of the 1978 Constitution which require analysis from a legis-prudential perspective.
These two articles appear to collide against each other and therefore it seems difficult to harmonize these two articles in order to find a solution to the constitutional problem. Hence, we must look at the legislative process as to how article 70(1) and article 33(2) got inserted into the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
Article 70(1) was included in the draft Bill relating to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. The draft Bill said that the President cannot dissolve Parliament until four and a half years unless Members of the Parliament request the President to dissolve Parliament with a two-thirds majority.
Article 70(1) is an absurd provision for the following reasons 
Firstly, it is impossible for the President to dissolve Parliament under article 70(1), as the Members of Parliament will never commit hara-kiri against themselves, when they are showered with pension benefits, etc.
Secondly, the President has very little control over Parliament, since the Prime Minister has more to do with Members of Parliament than the President and therefore any attempt by the President to dissolve Parliament prior to four and a half years may boomerang against him.
Thirdly, this Article 70(1) does not balance well with the Doctrine of Separation of Powers or Checks and Balances or Latimer House Principles, since the Parliament can impeach the President with a simple or two-thirds majority subject to certain conditions. Likewise President should be allowed to dissolve Parliament subject to similiar conditions. The doctrine relating to the Separation of Powers is designed to balance the three organs, namely, Executive, Legislature and the Judiciary in a rational manner. This doctrine has been recognized as a constitutional fundamental from Montesque to Latimer House Principles.
Hence, Article 70(1), as it stands, is an absurdity as it violates the pith and substance of the doctrine of Separation of Powers unless we recognize article 33(2) as a separate provision relating to the dissolution of Parliament.
Article 33(2) states that the President can dissolve Parliament without any restrictions. This article was included as a Committee Stage amendment. It is not clear whether it has been done so at the instructions of the Supreme Court or at the discretion of the architect/drafter of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. It is likely that the Supreme Court would have looked at the previous decision relating to the 19th Amendment in suggesting such an amendment to the Constitution.
In incorporating article 33(2), it appears that the Draftsman/architect has not looked at the consequential effects of such incorporation into the 19th Amendment of the Constitution (2015). In the absence of such provisions, the Supreme Court is empowered to fill the gaps by reference to sub-articles in article 70 for a dissolution under article 33(2) under the Dynamic Rule.
It must noted that Seven Member Bench decision of the Supreme Court In Re the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, [2002] 3 SLR, pages 85-112 should be binding on Three Member Bench in relation to the same matter, due to the Doctrine of Stare Decisis as outlined in Bandahamy vs Senanayake, (62 NLR 313), unless it is balanced with article 33(2) of the 19th Amendment. (Also see: Dr. Kanag-Isvaran, PC  The Tissue of Justice and Judicial Attitudes  Memorial Orations 2008-2012 - K.C. Kamalasabayson, PC).
It is also important to note that if there are two provisions of the 1978 Constitution which are inconsistent with one another, it is axiomatic to interpret the Constitution in the way it can work and not in a way the Constitution can become futile.
In this regard, the legal maxim  Ut res magis valeat quam pereat has been applied in several Common Law countries. This legal maxim means it is better for the Constitution to have effect than cease to operate. In the USA, Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch vs Maryland (1819) said that the Constitution must be interpreted in a way it can operate and not in a way it can perish. In Trinidad Cement Company Limited vs AG of Guyana (2008) The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Secretariat as amicus curiae argued successfully that the CARICOM economic integration legislation is futile unless the corporate entities are granted locus standi to institute proceedings in the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ) by adopting this legal maxim as the promissory clause 222 of the Treaty Chaguaramas is ambiguous.
It is also important to note that the legal maxim Generalia Specialibus Non Derogant (where there is conflict between the general and specific provision, specific provisions prevail) does not apply in this regard. The renowned author on this subject  Dr D. C Pearce in his book titled Statutory Interpretation in Australia, 8th Edition (2014) at page 185 states that when two provisions are not linked to each other, then this legal maxim does not apply. The dissolution of Parliament under article 33(2) is distinct from dissolution of Parliament under article 70(1) which operates at the request of the Parliament after four and a half years. Therefore, the President can dissolve Parliament at his discretion either under article 33(2) or under article 70(1), as these two articles are not linked to each other and differ in content and the manner in which they apply. In Sri Lanka, Queen vs Murgan Ramasamy (66 NLR 265) illustrates the manner in which this maxim applies. (See: Australian Securities and Investment Commission vs Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2009] 263 ALR 411 at page 78).
RELEVANCE OF THE DOCTRINE OF CONSTITUTIONAL NECESSITY
In this situation, it is also relevant to consider whether the Doctrine of Constitutional Necessity can justify the dissolution of Parliament. In India, Pakistan, Nepal, Grenada, Fiji and many other Commonwealth countries, the Doctrine of Constitutional Necessity has been applied in dealing with a constitutional deadlock.
In a book titled God Save the Honourable Supreme Court written by the distinguished Indian Lawyer, Fali S. Nariman cites the case of Krishna Kumar Singh vs State of Bihar 2017 (Bench of seven Judges), where constitutional necessity was applied in upholding certain Ordinances which were patently unconstitutional. (See also Qarase and Others vs Bainimarama and Others [2009] 3 LRC 614  The Commonwealth Latimer House Principles: Practitioners Handbook).
It is also relevant to consider whether the application the Doctrine of Constitutional Necessity is justified since there has been a deadlock between the President and the Prime Minister for some time. This deadlock has arisen due to divergent policies relating to the sale of national assets, ratification of FTAs without adequate consultation with affected parties, involvement of the PM in the Bond Scam and pursuing a flawed legislative agenda by relying on neo-liberal economic policies unsuitable for Sri Lanka in the 21st century.
In this situation, the President has made an attempt to resolve this deadlock by requesting Karu Jayasuriya, and later on, Sajith Premadasa to accept the post of Prime Minister. Both refused to accept the proposal.
Hence, the application of the Doctrine of Constitutional Necessity may be justified in order to resolve the present constitutional crisis in Sri Lanka by reference to the people. After all, sovereignty of the people as enshrined in Article 3 is the grund-norm of 1978 Constitution.
CONCLUDING REMARKS AND SUBMISSIONS
It can be concluded that the Constitution of a country is a living document and therefore it must interpreted in a manner it can work and not in a manner it can perish.
In dealing with the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka said in no uncertain terms that The power of dissolution of Parliament and the process of impeachment should be exercised where necessary in trust for the people only to preserve the sovereignty of the people and to make it meaningful, effective and beneficial to people.  See: Ex Cathedra Statements of Justice Saleem Marsoof, PC on this point in Some Thoughts on the Sovereignty of the People and the Rule of Law - Memorial Orations 2008-2012 - K. C. Kamalasabayson, PC.
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution did not resolve the constitutional problem envisaged by late Dr. N. M. Perera. Instead, the 19th Amendment has created many conceptual, contextual and syntactic ambiguities due to ad hoc Committee Stage amendments.
The architect/drafter has not transformed the Presidential System to a Parliamentary System of Government by using the correct legislative technique as adopted in the 17th Amendment to the 1978 Constitution. The 17th Amendment reduced the powers of the President by requiring him to act on the advice and/or on the recommendations of the Constitutional Council in the exercise of his executive powers in relation to certain appointments.
In this context, it is recommended that the 19th Amendment should be repealed and replaced by a new 19th Amendment to the Constitution, as it has ceased to be the centerpiece for good governance. Such an exercise should be assigned as Justice Frankfurter of the US Supreme Court said  to those who are capable and experienced in undertaking such tasks.

The Court of Appeal recently issued a Writ of Mandamus that compelled the Anuradhapura District Secretary to execute his duties to halt the Road Development Authority from constructing a 30 feet wide road way over Lolugaswewa causing destruction to the tank, its bund,bund reservations and the adjacent area.
The petitioner is Ekamuthu Govi Sanvidanaya.
The respondents are Commissioner General, Department of Agrarian Development, Director General of Irrigation Department, chief engineer Road Development Authority Anuradhapura and nine others.
Delivering the order Justice Mahinda Samayawardhena inter alia stated:The petitioner has obtained expert opinion from a retired Regional Director of Irrigation regarding the damage caused and likely damage to be caused to the tank bund and the tank. It appears that some party interested in setting up a purported Monastery has carried out this wanton destruction to the tank, which has been objected to, not only by the Petitioner Farmers Organization, but also by the North Central Provincial Council and the Chief Prelate of Anuradhapura Atamasthanaya.
The Deputy and Assistant Commissioners of Agrarian Development of Anuradhapura has very politely requested to stop further construction until necessary approvals are obtained after the damage has been considerably done.
Under the Irrigation Ordinance, No. 32 of 1946, heavy responsibilities have been cast upon the Director General of Irrigation and the Government Agents (District Secretaries) in protecting irrigation work. In the instant matter, they have conveniently turned a blind eye.

Why challenge President who represents peoples sovereignty
The dismissal of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe following the withdrawal of the SLFP headed by President Maithripala Sirisena from the government alliance kind of stabilized the political climate within the polity.
Those who question the validity of the recently appointed government must look at the Yahapalana government elected in 2015. That government stands as Sri Lankas very first puppet government. Analysts were quick to spot this, but not the incumbent critics of the recently appointed government. Lasanda Kurukulasuriya asked in 2015 is Lanka being micro managed from afar In 2016, the media said, Yahapalana is acting on a preplanned scenario. Government is following a foreign agenda, - the public agreed vehemently. What actually transpired was that a host of countries had explored every possible political avenue, by hook or crook, to topple Mahinda Rajapaksa and to install a puppet regime to achieve their goals. The ousted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was acting according to the dictates of the Western masters as Vasudeva Nanayakkara MP rightly pointed out.
It is now pertinent to ask why these camps challenge the president who they fought tooth and nail to install. Why Over to you those who installed Maithripala Sirisena at the helm of the countrys political administration to answer why they act as if they have never done any such thing now. After all, is he not the only person who represents the majority semblance of sovereignty

Climate Change Mitigation   A globally applicable solution
We live in a world which believes in energy at any cost and that includes at any cost to economy and/or environment. Such is our craving for energy. We have gone far too long on this journey that what lies next in this yearning for more and more energy is nothing short of destruction. But there seems to be no signs of political leaderships of countries across the world to take that firm step of preventing this. Although this is the message given by more knowledgeable personnel at Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), the ignorant I presume that another article on the topic may change this journey towards a climate change determined miserable world.
We want to emphasise that there could be a more prosperous world where we could generate Energy for the benefit of the Economy and Environment.
When IPCC members met at Incheon, South Korea in October 2018, their main pronouncements could be given in three sentences:
* Repercussions that were earlier predicted for a 2.00C rise in temperature are now predicted for a 1.50C increase.
* Damage to global economy arising from this could be as high as $54 trillion.
* While it is technically feasible to mitigate this, there are doubts about political will across the world.
It is these three sentences which prompted me to bring these words to our dear readership to-day.
What the World Bank Report says
World Bank has put outa document called South Asias Hotspots evaluating what is in store for six South Asian countries Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Outcomes which would befall the six countries have been predicted in terms of reduction in household consumption. It is based on the hypothesis that average household consumption or living standard is a function of temperature in the country.
For Afghanistan and Nepal the optimum temperature is more than current temperature and for Sri Lanka optimum temperature is 24.750C while current temperature is given as 27.50C. See Figure 1. So, any temperature increase due to climate change will result in a reduction in living conditions in 2030 and 2050 depending on two carbon emission pathways.
Accordingly, Sri Lanka will be the worst affected country in South Asia in 2050 experiencing a temperature increase of 1.0-1.50C under climate sensitive scenario and a precipitation variation of  3.9% again by 2050. Reduction in consumption arising from this will be 7.0%. Bangladesh comes second in the evaluation with a reduction of 6.7% in consumption under same climate sensitive pathway and by 2050.
Recently German Watch identified Sri Lanka to be 4th most vulnerable country in the world to climate change related risk having jumped 94 slots (from 98th to 04th most vulnerable country) in a couple of years. Bangladesh had also being in this listing in 2010 as we had mentioned in a recent article.
While these rankings  World Bank ranking and Climate Risk Index ranking  frightened us tremendously, we wanted to find a way out from these vulnerabilities. Any solution for such vulnerabilities needs to commence with finding out the root cause for vulnerability and World Bank report came to our rescue there. In their efforts to find possible routes to reduce vulnerabilities of South Asian countries, they evaluated the six countries in respect of six criteria including average road density in km/10km2. In respect of the first five criteria, there was no specific differentiation between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh on one hand and the other fourcountries on the other hand; but in respect of the sixth, average road density, SL and Bangladesh
had a very specific differentiation as could be seen in the figure above. While all other countries had road densities less than 4km/10km2,SL and BD had much higher road densities. In fact, actual data as given in their table no 4.3 shows these average road densities in km/10km2 to be (i) Bangladesh 5.8, (ii) India 1.6, (iii) Pakistan 1.4 and (iv) Sri Lanka 13.5. In my opinion this clearly identifies the reason behind Sri Lanka been the most vulnerable country in South Asia and 4th most vulnerable country in the world.
If somebody has been reading my articles on climate change and related topics consistently s/he would remember my emphasizing this road construction to be a key reason behind our enhanced vulnerability, over and over again.
It is no surprise at all
One should not be surprised about this finding. In fact, Prof. Ivar Giaever, Nobel Prize Winner in Physics had pronounced that global warming is basically due to excessive construction of highways. As we have always been saying highway construction involves (a) loss of (i) reflection of solar radiation (ii) conversion of solar energy to chemical energy, (iii) absorption of CO2 from atmosphere, (b) laying an asphalt layer on top of the soil leading to global warming and (c) running of thousands of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines liberating greenhouse gases (GHG) and waste energy on these roadways.
Above statements amply demonstrate the fact that we are in this extremely vulnerable situation due to our having built too many roadways and we are using them excessively using the most energy intensive vehicles.
World Banks solutionsfor Sri Lanka
Afterthis analysis about our vulnerability, WB has identified three development strategies to eliminate our vulnerability to climate change. It has identified effectiveness of recommended action by estimating resulting vulnerability after recommended action is implemented by 2050. Enhancing educational attainment by 30% and improving market access by 3% are projected to reduce impact of climate change on living standards to -2.6% and -2.1% respectively from current projection of -7.0% by 2050.
On the other hand, WB report goes on to predict that increasing non-agricultural employment by 30% relative to current levels could entirely eliminate the burden of changes in average weather on living standards; the overall impact could shift from -7 percent to +0.1 percent
I was thoroughly excited by this pronouncement and wanted to identify routes we should take. But unfortunately I was stuck very early by one uncertainty that it was not clear whether the recommended 30% increase should be in (a) number of persons engaged in non-agricultural pursuits or (b) percentage of persons engaged in non-agricultural activities, because we were talking about a change we should bring about by year 2050 and population would also change in the interim.
So, we gave up pursuing on WB recommendations and wish WB to clarify this further. It sounds too precious an improvement to ignore especially when the future is predicted to be as bad as been 4th most vulnerable country on the Planet Earth.
Our own solution  A mitigation Solution
In working out a solution, we looked at what we want to achieve from the solution. We noticed that what Sri Lanka needs is a solution which will not only help us by adaptation, but will also mitigate the risks at least partially.
In respect of action against GHG oriented Climate Change, Sustainable Energy by Prof. Jefferson Tester, et al prompts a three-pronged attack via mitigation, reduction and removal. (Please see Figure 2 below.) When IPCC decided to carry out a geo-engineering-based action via spraying Sulphur dust from an aeroplane, they were basically trying out a mitigation action. But the action which was estimated to cost as high as $ 1-10 billion per annum did not yield the anticipated result and Prof. Myles Allen of Oxford University has said that it is completely misleading to say that it is an easy short cut.
It is in this context of noother mitigation action been available nor proposed, even globally, that we present our own Sri Lankan mitigation solution which is called Highway Solarisation defined as A dedicated infrastructure using solar energy, collected by PV solar panels installed along and above the highways, for the grid or for powering battery electric vehicles.
So, the only two routes left out are Capture and Remove; there is no CO2 generated to be captured. If quantification is needed this solution removes via mitigation 1.4 kWhrs to be absorbed by the roadway and reemitted as longwave radiation leading to global warming, for every 1kWhr of electricity generated. These arise from generation of electricity and albedo of the solar panels.
Unlike spraying Sulphur dust which will be there only when it is sprayed, this solution will be there all the time and it could protect the highway from sunlight and rain water  the biggest culprits of damage to roadways to-day.
If one wants to look at losses on the supply side, one could see that this would reduce those losses by 1.8 kWhrs per every kWhr usedin Sri Lanka. The routes in the fuel switching strategy are self-explanatory.
Reduction in CO2 emissions which could be achieved from this will amount to either (i) 0.912 kg of CO2/kWhr if energy generated is used as electricity or (ii) 1.250 kg of CO2/kWhr if energy generated is used for transportation.
So honestly, can there be a better Mitigation Solution than this and can this reluctance to implement the same be due to it being a truly Sri Lankan Solution.
What it could do to the economy
Now that we have evaluated what Highway Solarisation could do to environment in the context of GHG emission trajectories, we can look at what it would do to the economy of the country. Just as much as it could benefit environment on more than one frontier, it could benefit economy also on more than one frontier.
For this we will consider one highway which could be solarized very easily i.e. 96 km extension of the Southern Expressway,being built with a $1.7Billion loan from China Exim Bank at 2% interest with a grace period of 5 years. We would need about Rs. 5.8 billion a yearto pay the interest, at current exchange rates and the toll to be collected may be inadequate, during the 1st few years of its operation, at least. So, the loan will eternally be in the books of the Central Bank. You will see umpteen number of economists preaching that building loan funded infrastructure not producing a tradeable product will only increase our foreign debt accounts; but none of them would tell you how to generate tradeable products on such infrastructure.
That is where this Highway Solarisation comes in handy. It could not only protect the environment from (i) 410kt of CO2every year if the energy is used for main grid or 562kt of CO2every year if the energy is used for transportation and (ii) 630 GWhrs/yr of global warming,but it can also settle the entire Chinese loan on the highway in 20 years. It would have taken another seven years before that to recover the investment on solarand the total time required is 27 years. The electricity it could generate, 450GWhrs is also equal to the total energy we expected from upper Kothmale Project of 150MW capacity.
I strongly believe that this would demonstrate the power of Highway Solarisation to mitigate Climate Change due to fossil fuel usage in Sri Lanka and we still have not addressed the full potential of the solution.
Potential of Highway Solarisation in Sri Lanka
It was in February 2011 that I submitted a proposal to Minister of Science & Technology seeking Rs. 55 million for a comprehensive feasibility to ascertain how much electricity could be generated by Highway Solarisation and the potential for vehicle electrification. (The government paid about Rs. 175 million to a British firm to get a feasibility study done for the SOREMPRO Project of the refinery). The team included qualified and experienced Electrical Engineer, Chemical Engineer (both former presidents of Energy Managers Association), Mechanical Engineer, Civil Engineer, Financial Analyst Environmental Engineer, IT Professional and it was copied to Minister of Environment as well. Environment Minister took it forward up to drafting a cabinet paper when suddenly the minister was swapped with Minister of Petroleum Industries and Minister of Science and Technology was swapped with Minister of Power of Energy.
As for my request, the 60 + page document with separate financial proposal and CVs of consultants came back with a letter from then Chairman of Inventors Commission, Deepal Sooriyaarachchi dated sometime in July, 2011 to say that the Commission did not have enough funds for the study. I, of course, was surprised by the fact that the pages of the proposal had not even been turned and they had taken 5 months to count the money in the kitty to see that it cannot afford Rs. 55 million. Such was how caring the commission had been for Sri Lankan inventors.
Since than I have been keeping count of roads in Sri Lanka which possess appropriate characteristics needed forHighway Solarisation. As I have mentioned in article quoted first, roadways to Jaffna, Mannar, Mulativu, etc. do have a lot of potential implementing Highway Solarisation. My current estimate, on the minimum side, for potential Highway Solarisation is about 3800MWs which would yield about 5700GWhrs per annum.
This matches well with daytime demand for electricity increasing as well and this daytime demand is expected to reach 4726MW in 2030. We also need to remember that efficiencies of photovoltaic solar panels  or output per unit area  is increasing and as we keep on solarizing these roadways, output that could be expected from a given area would also increase.
If this quantum of energy is used with vehicle electrification  buses, vans, cars, three wheelers and motorcycles all included  it can eliminate more than 22000GWhrs of waste energy, 7100kt of CO2 and 2900kt of Newly Formed Water Vapour in addition to another 8000GWhrs which would lead to global warming. It will also eliminate more than $1.5 billion going out to purchase oil for transportation.
Scientific backgroundof the solution
As we have explained at the International Energy Symposium held on 23rdJune, 2015 in Colombo, this Mitigation Solution is the outcome of a Six Sigma DMADV2 (Define, Measure, Analyse, Design, Verify and Validate) Exercise carried out as per methodologies given in Design for Six Sigma by Prof. Howard Gitlow, David M. Levine andEdward A. Popovich. Prof. Gitlow has been extremely impressed by the exercise and has contributed to revise initial workings to make it more comprehensive.
While all the first 5 stages have been completed and we have requested for a 3.5km stretch on the Suriyawewa  Mirijjawila Road (Route B562) to carry out the Validation of the solution with a 10MW project and awaiting a final decision.
What such a pilot project of significant dimensions could do to Sri Lanka and other South Asian countries may be beyond comprehension of policy analysts and administrators of Sri Lanka for whom climate change is the juggling of droughts and rains.
Before they could fathom out these differences, real climate change would tip us over beyond the Climate Risk Index No. 1 slot to follow Puerto Rico islet in the Gulf of Mexico area.
While our vulnerability to climate change is been emphasized by both World Bank and Global Watch, there are no signs of any seriousness been attached to their pronouncements.
Here, we have done what a scientist, interested about climate change could do in identifying a Mitigation Solutionand the outcome is far better than the mitigation solution  spraying Sulphur dust into the atmosphere  suggested by IPCC.
This solution based on technologies available to-day  PV solar panels, Battery Electric Vehicles, Batteries for BEVs, charging auxiliaries  is (a) do-able in the short term, (b) profitable even at present, (c) effective in respect of all aspects and most importantly is also reproducible even in other countries.
Politicians, Economists and Administrators should not say that Sri Lankan Scientists have let down the masses who have funded their educationby not showing the way to climate change mitigation; but by not implementing this solution politicians and administrators are letting down the masses who have not only funded their education, but also maintaining them even today.

Creative gifts for foodies
Foodies are all around us. Chances are that you know someone who loves to try new restaurants or is excited to add an exotic spice to their collection. If thats the case, then youre in luck; there are plenty of great foodie gifts to give to someone, regardless of their palate.
The stereotypical foodie is seen as someone obsessing over fine dining. But, this distinction can also describe a person who loves to cook and sees the practice as a way to express their creative side.
If thats the case, weve found sets of spices for some of the worlds most beloved meals - from pizza to tacos - to help make a signature dish even better. But if drinks are more your gift recipients style, try giving them a homemade kombucha kit, stylish pour-over coffeemaker, or travel cocktail set.
Of course, if you are buying for someone who prefers to eat rather than cook, we have you covered. An adorable croissant brooch is within your fingertips. No matter what you choose, one thing is for sure: the world is your oyster.

Faithful even after death
When animals enter our lives, they give real meaning to true friendship. Regardless of how we come across them, they make our days brighter. They evolve into family over time because they give relief from the burdens of everyday life. We rely heavily on their relentless loyalty to us and their ability to bring happiness to our life.
Sometimes we even find more comfort in our animals than we do with humans because they never seem to disappoint. People say that some animals have shorter life spans than humans because they are born knowing how to love, while humans must obtain that quality somewhere along the way of our longer lives.
But what happens when owners meet their end before their animals While animals cant mouth their devotion or grief with words, in regards to their late owners, these specific animals actions speak volumes to how far the bond between animal and human really goes.

Fitch downgrades SriLankan  Government-Guaranteed Bonds to B
Fitch Ratings has downgraded the rating on SriLankan Airlines Limiteds (SLA) USD175 million government-guaranteed bonds due in June 2019 to B from B+.
This follows the downgrade of Sri Lankas Long-Term Foreign and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings to B with a Stable Outlook (see Fitch Downgrades Sri Lanka to B; Outlook Stable, dated 3 December 2018).
The national carriers bonds are rated at the same level as SLAs parent, the state of Sri Lanka, due to the unconditional and irrevocable guarantee provided by the state. The Sri Lankan government held 99.5% of SLA at end-2017 through direct and indirect holdings
The downgrade of the sovereign reflects heightened external refinancing risks, an uncertain policy outlook, and the risk of a slowdown in fiscal consolidation as a result of an ongoing political crisis. To Fitch believes the ongoing political upheaval, which has disrupted the normal functioning of parliament, exacerbates the countrys external financing risks, which are already heightened by the tightening of global monetary conditions amid a heavy external debt repayment schedule between 2019 and 2022.
Fitch also expects fiscal slippages as the current political climate is likely to lead to delays in setting policy priorities and to disruption in progress on future reforms.
Fitch has rated SLAs US dollar-denominated bonds at the same level as the sovereign due to the unconditional and irrevocable guarantee provided by the government. The rating is not derived from its issuers standalone credit profile and thus is not comparable to its industry peers.

A good suggestion
UNF National List MP Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka is popularly known to be a loose cannon among the Sri Lanka public. His gaffes have been legion, so much so it is moot if he is being taken seriously at all by the public. Some say it is this trait that even cost him his Presidential bid in 2010.The former Army Commander, during that election campaign, made a stunning revelation that surrendering LTTE leaders, bearing white flags, were shot by the military on the orders of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. This, no doubt, earned for him the wrath of not only his military colleagues but also the vast majority of patriotic citizens, who, at the time, deified our security forces for annihilating the LTTE.
He also, at a media briefing, referred to an animal in describing one of his critics. This too certainly would have given an inkling to the voting public what they will be letting themselves in for should they elect Sarath Fonseka as President.
However, on Wednesday, in Parliament, the Field Marshal made a very sensible suggestion. He requested that, henceforth, all Heads of State of Sri Lanka be they Presidents or Prime Ministers, Service Chiefs, top bureaucrats and state officials holding responsible positions be subjected to a mental screening, periodically, in order to assess if they are mentally capable, any further, of carrying out their duties and responsibilities. He also wanted such a requirement be incorporated in the Constitution by way of an amendment. Field Marshal Fonseka noted that this was the norm in the USA. The US President is bound to go through a mental fitness every year, while the others, including the Service Chiefs, who have the final say in launching nuclear weapons are also bound to do the same. I suggest that similar laws should be in place in Sri Lanka as well, he stated.
Of course, no one will object to Fonsekas proposal, especially considering how some of our leaders have been behaving down the years. Subjecting our past Heads of State to compulsory mental examinations should have been commenced from the very inception. Had this been done much of the present problems faced by the country could have been averted. Had saner counsel prevailed and some of our leaders acted with foresight the national problem that morphed into a full blown war later on could certainly have been prevented. Instead, a false patriotism and lust for power clouded the judgement of our leaders leading to all our current predicaments.
The suggestion of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka for our leaders to be made to undergo periodical mental screening is also quite sound in a context that leaders who get power drunk over a period of time in office tend to lose their mental balance. This we have seen in many parts of the world, even in democracies, where those who get elected to office by popular vote suddenly lose their head, so to speak, and turn dictatorial, once entrenched in power. A compulsory mental test would certainly have exposed the flaw for remedial measures to be taken.
It would also not be a bad idea to subject all potential leaders of this country to a mental test in advance before the reins of power get into their hands. This way, trouble could be prevented before it could get started. In the past we had a leader who promised rice from the moon if she was made Prime Minister. The signs of the lunar effect was very apparent and had the practice of mental testing been in place at the time much of the problems such as scarcities, food shortages, queues etc. that marked that regime could have been averted. Then there was also a leader who fancied himself as a reincarnated Nepoleon and introduced a Presidential system of Government to cast himself like the emperor, a system that is still blighting this nation and the source of all the present problems.
Be that as it may, why only leaders and public officials one may ask Why not extend the rule to all members of Parliament and potential ones, including the Speaker who is being castigated today by critics who allege he is not sane. We say this because there are ample reasons and more for our honourable peoples representatives to be subjected to periodic mental tests especially going by their recent conduct. After all they are our lawmakers, and it will be healthy for all citizens of this country to have their craniums scanned. In any event the results would not show much grey matter in most of them. We say this because it is now known that as much as two thirds of our 225 MPs have not passed their GCE (O/L) exams, and, what is more, a good number of them had not even sat the exam. Did we not see on TV one of our honourable MPs trying to hang himself from a ceiling fan because his attempt to get some children in his constituency admitted to a school was prevented. Of course they all need their heads examined. Ditto for the voters who send them to Parliament.

Import of Russian cancer drugs
Government INCURRED  RS.3.8 Billion LOSS
The Government has incurred a loss of Rs.3.8 billion in the past two and half years in purchasing two clinically untested cancer drugs from Russia.
They are of low quality in comparison to other less costly brands, Small and Medium Scale Entrepreneurs Association president Sanjaya Perera said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Abhayaramaya temple in Colombo yesterday morning, he said that the loss is in addition to Rs.8.1 billion losses incurred through the imports of other drugs by the Health Ministry and the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) in the past. The two cancer drugs Trastuzumab and Bevazizumab, produced and imported from Russia are not clinically tested and higher in price when compared with the same type of other drugs which have US Food And Drug Authority (FDA) approval, which is recognised by the world. The damage done to the cancer patients by these drugs have still not being determined.
According to Perera, COPE, FCID and the Bribery and Corruption Commission have already been informed about these alleged financial frauds but investigations are still to commence.The formal complaints were made eight months ago. Now, we request President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a Special Presidential Commission and investigate the financial frauds and punish all culprits.
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) will be briefed on the issue.The questionable drug is not even used in the manufacturing country, Russia. The drug was hurriedly registered in the NMRA, Perera added.
Perera pointed out that this questionable intravenous drug had been ordered again by the SPC authorities a few days ago just after the Court of Appeal order preventing the Prime Minister and the Cabinet from functioning was issued. They had done it in order to avoid any losses that can be caused to the local importer (a company) of this drug. The company very strangely had large stocks of this very expensive drug knowing that the Health Ministry (SPC) will definitely purchase the drug from them. In 2016, 25 oncologists signed a letter informing the Health Ministry Secretary not to import and use this unsafe drug. There are only 34 oncologists in Sri Lanka. This unsafe and questionable drug was allegedly used by the Health Ministry while there are two more similar drugs with FDA approval available in Sri Lanka at cheaper prices. No Oncologists were there in the technical committee which approved the tender, he said.
Now the SPC has ordered the cheaper drug (50 percent) after the appointment of the new Health Minister Chamal Rajapaksa. It is questionable why the SPC did not use the cheaper high quality drugs in the past two and half years and always purchased low quality, clinically untested two Russian drugs which had been rejected by 25 oncologists in Sri Lanka and not used in any other country in the world including in its manufacturing country, Russia, he added.

H One launches Res.Q Machine Inventory
Leading full-service IT solutions provider, H One, announced the launch of Res.Q MI; an all-encompassing machine management solution designed with both large and small-scale factories in mind.
This cloud-based solution, developed by Sri Lankas trusted IT solutions provider, was launched at a private event attended by industry professionals.
Res.Q Machine Inventory is a revolutionary new asset management solution which leverages the capabilities of NFC (Near Field Communication) technology for the management, protection, and maintenance of one of the most vital assets of the apparel industry: its machinery.
The apparel industry is in a state of rapid change, where speed and efficiency are critical to a manufacturers success. Although the exchange of machinery between facilities - on a loan or rental basis- is a common practice across the industry, there has never been an efficient mode of automating and optimising these processes to productively monitor these movements.
Each machine is assigned a specific uniquely identifiable NFC tag which contains information, from the machines unique ID, its transaction history, break downs and service records.
Res.Q Machine Inventory also aids the commerce of the apparel industry with machine maintenance, for manufacturers can now ensure that their machinery is functioning at its optimal performance and also monitor a detailed record of its maintenance and service history of every machine.
Repair work for every machine is updated to the system via a mobile application paired with the NFC tag, and as a result a comprehensive record of the service and maintenance history -including spare part management- of each machine is monitored and immediately accessible. Another responsibility factory managers bear is the tedious task of manually managing needle supply to each machine or operator.
At the launch of this cutting-edge machinery management solution, key stakeholders and potential investors were introduced to the many benefits of this effective and paperless new technology. The key to any IT service is to make it easy for clients to have access to information which may otherwise involve a tedious process to accumulate, said H One Chief Executive Officer, Samath Fernando at the launch. This is exactly why we designed Res.Q Machine Inventory: an all-in-one solution for factory maintenance, enabling precision in tracking and maintenance with enhanced flexibility so that they can manage their machinery requirements on-site, which ultimately allows for well-informed, and intelligent decision-making.
Since its establishment in 2008 -as a progression from the Hirdaramani Group legacy spanning over 120 years- H One has become the forerunner in business intelligence solutions.
The launch of Res.Q Machine Inventory is the newest addition to its solutions portfolio following the release of the resourceful QMS (Quality Management System) just last year.

Hold proxy vote to select PM nominee,  say UNP members
The internal rift within the United National Party is escalating with its Provincial and Local Government members demanding to hold a proxy vote among them to choose a member for the Prime Ministers post and the party leadership.
The UNP hopefuls and party veterans have been unnerved by its leaderships constant reluctance to provide any political opportunities for its promising members.
Former Minister and Kurunegala district UNP Parliamentarian Ashok Abeysinghe yesterday said, some of their Parliamentarians, Provincial Council members and Local Government members have expressed their views regarding this to the party.
The party is concerned about it. I too have voiced my views in this regard, he said.
Asked what his views were, Abeysinghe said, The UNP leadership should change without delay.
As regards finding a nominee for the Prime Ministers position, he said, I am aware that our (UNP) Provincial Council and Local Government members and some Parliamentarians have communicated to our party top brass to hold a UNP Party Convention.
UNP sources said they have informed the party echelons to hold a vote during that Party Convention to select a nominee for the position of Prime Minister.
Abeysinghe said, This is not a bad idea at all.
But our (UNP) Working Committee and Parliamentary Committee had yet to decide on that, he said.
It should not have been difficult for the UNP to nominate a member other than Wickremesinghe for the Prime Ministers position when the President called them to do so.
UNP Parliamentarian Speaker Kau Jayasuriya and the UNP Deputy Leader have declined to accept the Presidents offer of Prime Ministers Post to replace Wickeremesinghe.
UNP MP Manusha Nanayakkara said appointing a new leader for the party seems necessary. It will be done at the right time by the UNP.
The President may call on us to choose a new MP for that post, but then it would not be Constitutional, as pointed out by Nanayakkara. Asked what would UNP do about requests made by its public representatives from PCs and LGs to choose a Prime Minister nominee at a Party Convention, he said, I am aware that there are many talks in this regard. But, I do not know whether there has been any official request by our camp. Our sources said that several UNP groups have submitted a letter in this connection to the UNP Secretary General.

Land of singing fish
Juliet Coombe embarks on a series of exciting experiencesfacilitated by Sunrise by Jetwing where its General Manager Wester Felthman, who is passionate about community tourism and puts Pasikuda on the international travellers map as an all year roundplace to stay.
Kingsley opened the gate and welcomed us explaining as he offered a cool drink the range of projects they do in Batticaloa with over fifty families working alongside them improving their lifestyles daily. As we walked around the office with vibrant handicrafts for sale in one section and a huge flower banner on the wall with petals opening out showing a variety of exciting cooking and home stay experiences we all decide on doing the full day Lets Cook and Fish experience. I also fancied the historic Batticaloa tour, which reveals the areas amazing hidden history.
In addition to the experiences they offer a range of services that get you closer to the local textile makers like the Palmyrah weavers and with Sunrise by Jetwing organising the transport to join any one of these exciting full day trips, which are making a huge difference to the area. It makes me and the kids feel that our holiday is making a real difference to an island that has been set back due to civil war, tsunami and a lack of real development in this particular area of the island. Before leaving the office we receive a beautiful hand woven Palmyrah bag of treasures in the form of pre-packed spices including roasted curry powder, seeds, dried curry leaves and a handmade coconut spoon to cook with when we got back home. After looking round the operational area we are taken to the bike shed at the back of the building and are measured up and given a helmet as safety is key to every aspect of their operation.
Then off we head on the bikes along Lake Road, where you will pass historically extraordinary places hit badly by the thirty year civil war and the 2004 tsunami, which has left the ruins of houses decimated by the waves. All that remains in some cases are the water wells as a reminder to all of the devastation that took place across the island. There are several religious buildings that collapsed like the magnificent facade and entrance of Morugan Alayam Tamil Temple and Santa Maria Church on the beach, which the locals have decided to keep as a memorial to the worlds largest ever natural disaster killing a quarter of a million people across the Indian ocean. Our first proper stop is at the Kallady Bridge built by the British in 1924, one of the oldest and longest iron bridges in Sri Lanka, which crosses over the 53-kilometre lagoon, where we learn singing fish can be heard at midnight. Kingsley with a mischievous sparkle in his eyes says some people think it is the song of the mermaids that live in these mythical waters. As we bike along the idyllic stretch of lagoon stopping for a coconut drink to cool off we see where the sea planes land and what remains of the Dutch colonial fort and then head in land to the colourful Batticaloa food market.
In the market we start in the vegetable section and learn how snake gourd is good for combating cholesterol, and discover how buckets full of black cherries currently in season combat diabetes. The boys were amazed by the size of the giant bottle gourds, which are excellent for curing urine infections and the huge variety of herbal leaves for sale by women from the local farms, which are brewed to make all sorts of medieval style healthy medicinal teas. On we bike to Johdys cooking class at 10.30am and here in a delightful home stay setting we are taught how to make Tamil style curries and depending on the ability of the group we cook between 8 to 10 curries. The cooking is very different from the Singhalese style and this gourmet hands on experience is lots of fun as we get to cut, learn which spices to use when and mix the ingredients so you can understand the real feel behind the scenes making of these delicious dishes. Johdy is a very patient teacher making us laugh as we all have a go at making their national dishes. My sons favourite bit was pulling the curry leaves off a branch and throwing them into the pumpkin curry as a final flourish at the end and then having a taster of this delicious recipe before sitting down in her garden to enjoy a feast of dishes accompanied by one of four thousand different rice varieties that can be found in Sri Lanka.
After relaxing and meeting Jodys daughter who is fourteen and already an accomplished henna artist, whose work adorns the walls of the dining room where the cooking class took place. We drink a refreshing lime juice and head out again on our bikes to have a go at one of the islands oldest forms of net fishing. The bike ride reveals village life, even a snake crossing the road if you are lucky and also some of the sadder aspects of consumer rubbish, which really need addressing. Something Sunrise by Jetwing plan to get involved in as clearing up the beaches and other beautiful area riddled with plastic is part of their day to day operational practices. Once on the lagoon we are met by three colourful outrigger fishing boats and after putting on life jackets, we roll up our trousers and wade through the water to each get into one of the pretty canoe like boats, and head out with a net that takes goliath strength to pick up. Even I can't pick it up it is so heavy to carry, let alone throw and watching it unfurl like a giant spiders web is like an epic movie scene it is so spectacular. It is also great fun seeing the ghost like lagoon jelly fish that float by the wooden boats and watch fish jump as the net gets dragged back in, and we all have a go at picking small fish out of its webbing and putting them in a bucket.
After an exciting hour of jelly fish spotting, throwing nets, catching fish and even trying to make our own fishing line for the kids with a string and hook attached to a bottle, we head back to the office. Here we learn about other exciting tours, enjoy a cool drink and have a chance to ask questions about the many other community adventures they organise, which include a plot to plate farming tour and an excellent sailing adventure. All of which one can enjoying by booking a week at Sunrise by Jetwing who are all about being the change we want to see in the world and making a trip to stay in Pasikuda and unforgettable one.

The Leaning Tower of Pisa is not as tilted as it once was after it straightened slightly as a result of engineering work to protect the tourist attraction.
Experts of the towers surveillance group, which monitors restoration progress, said the monument was stable and very slowly reducing its lean following 17 years of observation.
The 57-metre (186ft) construction straightened by 4cm (1.5in), according to engineering professor Nunziante Squeglia of Pisa University, who was quoted in Italian media reports.
The surveillance group was set up after Michele Jamiolkowski oversaw an international committee to save the landmark between 1993 and 2001.
An increasing lean saw the famous tower close to the public in January 1990 for 11 years over safety fears. Its tilt had reached 4.5 metres (15ft).
The monument has been straightened by more than 40cm (15.7in) since then.
It has always stood slightly to one side ever since building started in 1173 but remained a symbol of medieval Pisas power.

This acts as a vivid contrast to the touch self-ordering kiosks predominantly displayed on the first floor of the restaurant, which provide enhanced convenience to consumers.

The customers, after ordering through the kiosks, can simply take their receipt to the cashier to process the payment (if made in cash), and collect their meal. The customers will also have the opportunity to pay for their orders via debit card or credit card at the kiosks themselves, which are the first of their kind in Sri Lanka.
Another striking aspect of the restaurant is the new and improved Drive-Thru, which lets customers pick up a delicious McDonalds meal on their way home. The restaurant features a drive-through windowwhere customers can easily receive their orders and interact with McDonalds staff, without having to get out of the car.
Further, McDonalds Bambalapitiya is the ideal restaurant for family get-togethers and a rendezvous with friends. The scrumptious Happy Meals and a spacious play-area also make the restaurant a fun and exciting trip for kids.

Money can be allocated through vote on account  Bandula
Financial management of the country is not an issue since the Constitution has provisions to allocate money through a vote on account, Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena said.
He was addressing the media along with Parliamentarians Laksman Yapa Abeywardena and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa yesterday in Colombo.
Gunawardena said that there are provisions with the President to allocate money when Parliament is dissolved. If Parliament continues, money can be allocated through a vote on account for three months, he said.
He said the UNP parliamentarians are circulating rumours that salaries of State servants cannot be paid from January. They say loan instalments, Samurdhi benefits, pensions and other welfare payments cannot be paid as the government has no rights to allocate funds. Gunawardena said there is no truth in that since the funds can be allocated by a vote on account for three months.
According to State monetary regulations, there is no issue until December 31, he said.
He said that even if a new government is elected, the President has powers to allocate money for three months until a budget is presented. The President also has powers to allocate money even to hold an election.
The new government was about to present a vote on account of Rs 1,735 and the proposal received Cabinet approval.
Everyone should support to pass the bill of a vote on account in Parliament if it is presented. Those who dont support to pass it, can go to their seats and face people, he said.
UNP is threatening State servants when carrying out their duty. They cannot threaten State servants, he said.
Parliamentarian Anura Priayadarshana Yapa said State servants should not be afraid of carrying out their services or making necessary payments within the provisions of government regulations.
He said the 19th amendment has created a severe mess.
The UNP wanted to transfer powers of the Executive President to the Prime Minister through the backdoor implementing the 19th amendment.
Instead of strengthening the Prime Minister, the powers of Parliament were reduced with the 19th amendment, he said.
Measures will be taken to revise the 19th amendment, he said.
Parliamentarian Laksman Yapa said State servants are duty bound to carry out State policies and regulations.

NUWAN KULASEKERA -  A Captains dream cricketer
He always sported a knowing smile with his team mates and also his opponents. Yet he was a viper with ball in hand. He sent sent down deliveries which had venom written in them. If this was NUWAN KULASEKERAS way of saying he was a smiling viper he did it with calculated ease.
KULESEKERA MUDIYANSELAGE DINESH NUWAN KULASEKERAs was one of the most likeable characters one could meet. When he was in the thick of things in local and international cricket he proudly sported the countrys cap with great pride and distinction.
Success or failure did not matter to him. What mattered most was playing of the game in the true spirit, always endeavoring to win games for his side, playing clean and hard. What matters most was that the game should be played with grace whether one won or lost.
Winsome smile
As a cricket correspondent I have been with him on many tours abroad and can vouch for his attributes. He always had that winsome smile writ on his face but endearing as he was he was always competitive in the true spirit of the game. That is what is expected from a true sportsman. Winning or losing is not what matters, but how one played the game goes the axiom. And KULESEKERA had these attributes from the time he stepped on to a cricket field. He was a medium pace bowler, yet devastating with his master swing both ways. He had a well disguised slow ball and when letting go a bouncer that was venomous and which batsmen preferred to move away rather than attempt to hook and get hit by his well directed bouncer and suffer anguish and pain.
Second to none
As a batsman, he was second to none. On his day and he could prove as devastating as he is with ball when having bat in hand and fighting to save or having the opportunity to score for his team when victory was beckoning.
As a fielder he had a safe pair of hands, always on the look out to grab the catch, whether it was a sitter or a difficult one. He was aware that catches win matches and a drop would not always mean losing, but it could make winning that much more difficult. He was always a captains dream team man.
After walking the cricket fields here and abroad and being a role model and an example every budding cricketer would be fortunate to have and follow, he bid adieu when everyone was asking why and why not. There was no doubt that he enjoyed the spills and thrills associated with the great game of cricket.
Economical bowler
A bowler of KULASEKERASS class who had the abilities of bowling economically concentrating on line and length and being miserly in conceding ruins should have been let loose in more Test matches than the 21 he played in his career.
But the selectors and the coaches were convinced that he was especially a bowler who would have been ideally suited for the cowboy game where he would not leak runs and fronted him up in 184 ODIS and 58 T20S. Without a murmur he took what was served to him in his plate and gave of his best.
KULASEKERA is best remembered for bowling a death over spell where along with skipper Lasith Malinga he throttled the Indian batting with some well directed deadly yorkers that the Indian batsmen failed to score off however hard they tried. He was one of the architects when he won the Twenty20 World Cup putting the Indians to second best which would have been galling to them.
Memorable
He will not easily forget his memorable one-day international debut which was against England at Dambulla where he bowled economically to take 2 for 18 and help bundle out the Brits for 88 which the Sri Lankan openers obtained in 14 over to score a 10-wicket victory.
KULASEKERA was born on July 22,1982 in Nittambuwa and educated at Bndaranayake College, Gampaha. He made his Test debut on April 4, 2005 against New Zealand and played his last Test on March 16, 2013 against Bangladesh. He debuted in ODIS in November 18, 2003 against England and played his final ODI on JULY 10, 2017 against Zimbabwe. T20 debut on October 11, 2008 and bid adieu on April 6, 2017 against Bangladesh.
KULASEKERA was in great demand by Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League and also played for Colts CC, Galle CC, Kandurata Maroons, Combined Provinces, Basnahira North.

Oils sharp price drop fuels questions for stock market
U.S. stock investors are wary that a 30 percent slump in oil prices will pressure corporate profits while also presenting a sign of weakness in global growth at a time they are already weighing when the long economic expansion will end.
Crude prices rebounded off of one-year lows to start the week, with investors focused on Thursdays meeting in Vienna of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied producing countries including Russia. A monitoring committee of OPEC and its allies agreed on the need to cut oil output in 2019, two sources familiar with the discussions said.
Oils drop holds economic benefits, including lower costs for some companies and cheaper fuel prices for consumers. But investors were already bracing for a significant drop in U.S. profit growth next year, and the oil price slump is poised to bite into profits for energy producers and related companies that are part of Wall Streets benchmark S&P 500 stock index .
OPEC and allied producers used output cuts to curb an oil glut that sent prices from late 2014 into a prolonged slump, bringing prices to below US$30 a barrel at the start of 2016. But supplies are growing again, and the U.S.-China trade war and other factors have investors worried that slowing economic growth could erase demand and send prices still lower.
What started the sell-off on oil was a supply issue, said Alicia Levine, chief market strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management. In the last couple of weeks, what we are getting is fears of slowing demand. And fears of slowing demand are directly related to fears of global growth slowdown.
Crude oil prices have fallen 30 percent or more 13 times since 1982, according to Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research. Of the prior 12 occurrences, the oil drop overlapped eight times with what Ned Davis Research defines as a cyclical bear market - a 30 percent drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after 50 calendar days or a 13 percent decline after 145 calendar days.

People, the best umpires to solve current crisis - Dilshan
Former national cricketer Tillakaratne Dilshan said a General Election is the only solution to the current political impasse facing the country.
He said this at a media conference Voice of Justice held at the Western Province Aesthetic Center (NADA) yesterday.
Dilshan said a country can move in the right direction only through the peoples power and it is possible to create a stable country by. Dilshan also called on the people to take informed decisions to elect suitable people to Parliament.
At this moment there is a clash between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary.If we are to resolve this, then we must definitely listen to the people and go for a General Election,he said. He further said that his personal opinion is that they can form a stable country by expressing the will of the people through an election, establishing a proper government and establishing a stable country. He said when they play cricket they have two umpires in the middle and when both of them can not make a decision, they are directed to the third umpire.At this time we must go to the third umpire and that is the voters.

The Chief Incumbent said they have already taken further steps to hand over the said petition to the Commissioner of Elections and the Prime Ministers Secretariat. It was also learnt that the said petition was signed with the intention of requesting a General Election to overcome the current political impasse and also to remove the non patriotic political leaders who are the bane of society.
The Thera said that the people in this country have now realised that the change they wished for in 2015 was a myth and they were taken for a ride by the previous Government.
Today, this country is facing anarchy with no Prime Minister and a Cabinet. Therefore, the only solution for overcoming this dangerous situation is to call for a General Election, Ven. Muruththettuwe Thera said.
The Maha Sangha always expects the people to take a wise decision by electing a sensitive and patriotic leader who will uphold the indigenous values and traditional values of the country. In this regard, the Maha Sanga, will always support and assist such a leader like former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, who will protect Buddhism, the Thera said.

Pujara ton helps India claw back
Adelaide, Thursday: Cheteshwar Pujara scored a gritty 123 in punishing conditions to claw India back into the opening Test in Adelaide Thursday after Australia seized early control with some blistering bowling.
Nathan Lyon, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc all grabbed two wickets each as temperatures topped 36 Celsius (96.8 Fahrenheit) and the tourists wilted to 250-9 at stumps on day one.
The experienced Pujara faced 246 balls in his gutsy knock -- passing 5,000 Test runs for his 16th Test century -- as the wickets tumbled around him, including superstar captain Virat Kohli for three.
At the end of a day characterised by poor shot selection, Pujara went for a quick single on the second last ball and was removed in a brilliant run-out by a diving Cummins.
Batting after Kohli won the toss, the visitors crumbled in a disastrous morning session under a pace barrage before digging in later in the day with Pujara and Ravi Ashwin (25 off 76 balls) staging a fightback as the bowlers tired.
In their first home Test since the ball-tampering scandal in March, Australia took four wickets before lunch with the batsmen guilty of playing at deliveries they would have been better off leaving alone.
Australian bowling coach David Saker said it was a premeditated plan for the quicks to pitch it up and lure Indias batsmen into false shots.
We got the wickets the way we thought we might get the wickets, he told the Seven Network.
Khawaja stuns Kohli
Opener KL Rahul, who has been struggling for runs, flopped again, caught by Aaron Finch at third slip off Hazlewood for two.
Veteran Murali Vijay, in the side after young gun Prithvi Shaw suffered ankle ligament damage, didnt last much longer, caught behind by skipper Tim Paine off Starc for 11.
In marched Kohli to a huge roar from the crowd, but Usman Khawaja at gully spectacularly caught him off a Cummins delivery as he attempted a drive, out after facing only 16 balls.
It was stunning one-handed take by Khawaja, whose preparations were upset by the shock arrest of his brother this week for allegedly framing a love-rival with a fake terror plot.
The dismissal of Kohli, who has scored five centuries in his two previous Test tours of Australia and rates Adelaide his favourite overseas ground, sparked wild celebrations.
Vice captain Ajinkya Rahane and Pujara worked to steady the ship.
But after returning from a break, Hazlewood enticed Rahane into a drive and he edged to Handscomb in the slips for 13.
Rohit Sharma, preferred in the final XI to all-rounder Hanuma Vihari, compiled a patient 31 before sweeping Lyon for six, narrowly missing being caught on the ropes.
Sharma then needlessly tried the same shot on the next ball, and this time debutant Marcus Harris comfortably collected the steepling catch, with the right-hander once more failing to capitalise on a good start.
It was left to Pujara, in his 65th Test, to stay at the crease and keep chipping away, building a 41-run partnership with Rishabh Pant and then 62 with Ashwin before he was run out by Cummins. AFP

Putin threatens to develop banned nuclear missiles
RUSSIA: A defiant Vladimir Putin on Wednesday threatened to develop nuclear missiles banned under a treaty with the United States after Washington gave Moscow a deadline to comply with the key arms control agreement.
The latest spike in tensions came a day after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington would withdraw from a major Cold War treaty limiting mid-range nuclear arms within 60 days if Russia does not dismantle missiles that the US claims breach the deal.
Putin dismissed Pompeos statement as a smokescreen, saying Washington had already decided to ditch the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty (INF).
They thought we would not notice, the Kremlin chief said, claiming the Pentagon has already earmarked an amount for the development of missiles banned by the treaty.
We are against the destruction of this treaty. But if this happens, we will react accordingly. Putin said about a dozen countries were now producing mid-range missiles of the type banned by the INF treaty.
Apparently now American partners believe the situation has changed so much that the United States should also have such weapons.
What will be our answer A simple one: we will also do this, Putin said.
In Brussels, EU diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini urged Russia and the US to save the treaty, warning that Europe did not want to become a battlefield for global powers once again, as it had been during the Cold War.
The INF has guaranteed peace and security in European territory for 30 years now, Mogherini said as she arrived for talks with NATO foreign ministers.
In October, President Donald Trump sparked concern globally by declaring the United States would pull out of the deal and build up Americas nuclear stockpile until people come to their senses.
Putin at the time warned that abandoning the treaty and failure to extend another key arms control agreement known as the New START, would unleash a new arms race and put Europe in danger.
On Monday, the US leader said he wants talks with Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to head off a major and uncontrollable arms race.
Valery Gerasimov, head of Russias General Staff, said that Moscow would increase the capabilities of its ground-based strategic nuclear arms.
One of the main destructive factors complicating the international situation is how the US is acting as it attempts to retain its dominant role in the world, he said in comments released by the defence ministry.
It is for these purposes that Washington and its allies are taking comprehensive, concerted measures to contain Russia and discredit its role in international affairs.
Signed in 1987 by then US president Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, the INF resolved a crisis over Soviet nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles targeting Western capitals.
But it was a bilateral treaty between the US and the then Soviet Union, so it puts no restrictions on other major military actors like China.
Pompeo said at a meeting with fellow NATO foreign ministers on Tuesday that there was no reason why the US should continue to cede this crucial military advantage to rival powers.
NATO said it was now up to Russia to save the treaty.
The Trump administration has complained of Moscows deployment of Novator 9M729 missiles, which Washington says fall under the treatys ban on missiles that can travel distances of up to 5,500 kilometres (3,400 miles)
The nuclear-capable Russian cruise missiles are mobile and hard to detect and can hit cities in Europe with little or no warning, according to NATO, dramatically changing the security situation on the continent.
US-Russia ties are under deep strain over a number of crises including accusations Moscow meddled in the 2016 US presidential election.
The two Cold War enemies are also at odds over Russian support for Bashar al-Assads regime in Syrias civil war, and the conflict in Ukraine. Washington on Tuesday promised Russia more pain if Moscow did not release three Ukrainian vessels and 24 sailors captured off Crimea last last month. - AFP

A group of former United National Party (UNP) parliamentarians yesterday called on party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe to step down and hold a special UNP convention to decide on the partys new candidate for the post of Prime Minister.
The group which includes former party General Secretary Tissa Attanayaka, former ministers, deputy ministers and MPs said urgent measures should be taken to restore democracy in the party.
The former UNP MPs stressed that it was imperative for Wickremesinghe to be replaced as the party leader to ensure democracy in the party and its success at future elections.
The group said they have been calling for party reforms for a long time but it had fallen on deaf ears.
They said the party was in its death throes today since Wickremesinghe is running the party dictatorially for the last 24 years.
The group questioned how a leader who had undermined democracy in the party could talk about democracy in the country. They said the best way forward was to call for an urgent party convention and let the membership decide who the next leader and the prime ministerial nominee.

SL second most affected country with adverse weather
Sri Lanka was the second most affected country from extreme weather events in 2017 according to the Global Climate Risk index 2019 report published on Tuesday in COP 24.
Centre for Environmental Justice Founder Hemantha Withanage, who was participating in the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 24) in Katowice, Poland, said the latest report released at the forum by Germanwatch (a think tank and research group) ranked Sri Lanka as the second in the list of countries to be affected by extreme weather events in 2017.
According to the report available online, Puerto Rico, Sri Lanka and Dominica were at the top of the list of the most affected countries in 2017.
The report points out that over 200 people died and 600,000 people were displaced in May 2017 in southwestern regions of Sri Lanka due to landslides and floods that occurred after the worst rains on the Indian Ocean since 2003.
According to the report, the Climate Risk Index indicates a level of exposure and vulnerability to extreme events, which countries should understand as warnings in order to be prepared for more frequent and/or more severe events in the future.
Altogether, more than 526,000 people died as a direct result of more than 11,500 extreme weather events; and losses between 1998 and 2017 amounted to around USD 3.47 trillion (in Purchasing Power Parities), the report said. Between 1998 and 2017, Puerto Rico, Honduras and Myanmar were the most affected countries by extreme weather events.
It says Sri Lankas loss in the last year due to extreme weather events amounted to around USD 3,129.351 million (in Purchasing Power Parities). PPPs measure the total amount of goods and services that a single unit of a countrys currency can buy in another country.
The Climate Risk Index aims to contextualize ongoing climate policy debates  especially the international climate negotiations with real-world impacts during the last year and the last 20 years, the report explained.
