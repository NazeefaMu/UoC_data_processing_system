Highlighting on the development of the hospitality services in the country Chairman Cooray said arrival of tourists to Sri Lanka is increasing due to the availability of sophisticated hotel accommodation and exceptional Lankan style hospitality services.

Konta shocked by Siegemund after midnight
MADRID, Sunday  British number one Johanna Konta was knocked out in the Madrid Open first round by Laura Siegemund in the early hours of Sunday morning in a match that finished after 2am (0000 GMT).
With all six scheduled matches on the main Manolo Santana court going the full three sets, the on-form Siegemund, fresh from winning in Stuttgart last week, and sixth seed Konta didn't get on court until just before midnight.
Konta appeared to have handled the long wait better as she took the first set 6-3.
However, Siegemund battled back to take her winning streak to six matches, four of which have come against top 10 players, by taking the final two sets 7-5, 6-4. Eugenie Bouchard set up a potential mouth-watering second-round clash with Maria Sharapova by registering her first win on the WTA Tour since January's Australian Open over France's Alize Cornet 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. Bouchard called Sharapova a cheater last week and suggested the Russian should be banned for life after testing positive for meldonium.
Sharapova faces Mirjana Lucic-Baroni in the first round on Sunday as the Russian continues her comeback from a 15-month ban.
I hope I can play Maria, said Bouchard.
Once I step on the court, everything will be to the side.
But, you know, inside myself, I think I'll have a bit more motivation.
World number three Karolina Pliskova was the only seed in action on Saturday to survive and even the Czech was pushed hard by Lesia Tsurenko before winning 7-6 (7/5), 2-6, 6-2. Ninth seed Madison Keys was beaten by Japan's Misaki Doi 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
And 12th seed Elena Vesnina's poor form since winning in Indian Wells in March continued with a straight sets 6-4, 6-4 defeat to Romanian Irina Begu.  AFP

Lankan eCom Dulith Herath meets Jack Ma of Alibaba
In a strategic move to boost e-commerce in Sri Lanka as part of the nations trade development within the current digital age, our very own e-commerce, Dulith Herath met the global e-com king Jack Ma.
Herath who founded and drove the countrys largest and most successful e-com portal Kapruka, is a visionary leader who foresaw the importance of Sri Lanka stepping into digital trade much before the online business boom took over the world. Similarly, Jack Ma- the celebrated Founder and Chairman of the worlds largest family of internet based business network Alibaba is a venerated figure in global e-commerce.
The meeting between the two innovators was held in Geneva as part of a United Nations initiative to boost digital retail within developing nations as a progressive tool for business growth.
The duo discussed forming strategic collaborations to explore the true potential of e-commerce in countries like Sri Lanka and utilising homegrown tools like the Kapruka owned Grasshoppers set-up to overcome traditional challenges encountered during e-trade. The meeting promised the beginning of a revolution in Lankan digital retail, paving the way to new possibilities for the entire local ecosystem of entrepreneurs, brands and businesses looking to reach a global market.
While the United Nations is optimistic on facilitating private and public partnerships in developing countries, global influencers like Jack Ma, the founder and executive chairman of Alibaba too find the such nations to have incredible potential to use digital retail for economic progress.
Kapruka founder and CEO Dulith Herath too has similar beliefs and is keen to leverage this massive opportunity to join forces with a global e-commerce network to take Sri Lankan digital retail to the next level by using locally developed platforms and solutions.
Here, homegrown tools like Grasshoppers that were founded by Dulith Herath with Dr. Harsha Liyanage and seed funded by Kapruka, were discussed.
Grasshoppers is a setup developed to overcome the three most common barriers in e-commerce - delivery, secure payment and assistance in import /export processes. Currently valued at an astounding 1 Billion LKR by Stax Inc and at the verge of reaching island wide growth, Grasshoppers focuses on up-coming small and medium sized e-commerce ventures.
With such promise, it was discussed to use Grasshoppers to introduce Ali Pay and reliable Cash on Delivery services similar to the solutions under Jack Mas Alibaba network to Sri Lanka. Mas payment platform Alipay is already more widely used than VISA and MasterCard and is predicted to be larger than the two combined by 2019.
During the meeting, Jack Ma expressed a keen interest in working with innovators and entrepreneurs like Herath, instead of politicians or traditional businessmen.
Ma went on to discuss his interest in the South Asian region with Herath, and the two found common interests not only from a business point of view, but also at a humanitarian level of benefitting the society by empowering small and medium businesses and new entrepreneurs with e-commerce as a tool for connecting to global markets.
The collaboration was initiated by UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) which recognises e-commerce as an important driver of innovation and growth in business for entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises worldwide.

Monaco edge closer to Ligue 1 title with Nancy win
PARIS, Saturday - Monaco edged closer to a first Ligue 1 title since 2000 as a 3-0 win at Nancy gave them a three-point lead over defending champions Paris St Germain on Saturday.
Tobias Badila's own goal and strikes by Bernardo Silva and Thomas Lemar put the principality side on 86 points with three games to play, while PSG, who have two games left, crushed Bastia 5-0. Monaco, who have a much better goal difference, will be virtually champions if they beat Lille at home next weekend. Leonardo Jardim's side went ahead after three minutes when Badila deflected Valere Germain's cross into his own net.
Portugal midfielder Silva headed home from Lemar's cross to make it 2-0 five minutes before the break. Lemar sealed a straightforward win four minutes from time, after latching on a Kylian Mbappe pass. Earlier, PSG had kept alive their own slim title hopes.
There was a minute of applause before kickoff to mark the 25th anniversary of the Furiani tragedy that killed 18 people in 1992 when one of the terraces of the stadium collapsed before a French Cup semi-final.
PSG went ahead in the 32nd minute when Lucas latched on to a cross from Blaise Matuidi. Marco Verratti doubled the tally three minutes later with a 25-metre effort while Bastia keeper Jean-Louis Leca was tending to the apparently injured Matuidi. Edinson Cavani increased the lead when he tapped in from Goncalo Guedes's cross in the 76th minute.
Marquinhos made it 4-0 six minutes later, pushing the ball into the net after Giovani Lo Celso had beaten Leca with a delicate chip, just after Cavani had missed a penalty. The Uruguay striker made up for his miss one minute from time with his 33rd league goal of the season. - Agencies

## Title: More than skin deep

More than skin deep
She is an undisputed legend in the beauty culture scene. With more than three decades of experience in the hair dressing industry Ramani Fernando has reached the pinnacle of the beauty scene through dedication, hard work and talent. Ex cricketer and cricket television commentator Ranjith Fernando, Ramanis life partner, tells us how the glamorous lady became the trailblazer in the industry.
First impression
We saw each other at the Air Ceylon Dance where Ramani had come with friends who were neighbours. I saw her there for the first time but I was not introduced to her then. She looked simple and unsophisticated, dressed in sari and later I got to know that it was her 17th birthday.
Attraction
Its hard to tell what really drew me to her but there is always a sixth sense that keeps telling you what is good for you. I had that feeling when I met her.
On Ramanis achievements
National cricketers of my time could not even think of making a living out of cricket. Fortunately, I had a good, steady job, under a great employer which gave us opportunities of an all round training and also fashioned us to be the best we could be in all the talents we possessed. The virtues of hard work and loyalty were drilled into us and I am sure, some of it and my biz acumen rubbed off from me on Ramani too.
Ramani runs her business not on any formal business plan but more by intuition. When I read about some of the reputed business gurus, I find she does many things they talk about which comes naturally to her. So I suppose she does most right things and has the processes in place to be successful. When it comes to a big business decision nothing can shake her until she gets the feel good feeling for her to even move a finger. That seems to work wonders for her.
Fashion tips from Ramani
She would love to and tries hard to make me fashionable but we have been married long enough for her to know that though she lays out my clothes most of the time, its hard to change my conventional dressing habits. Do you think that I have taken any tips from her when you see my style of dressing at any event One thing she is passionate about is me wearing short hair and I get hounded even when it is half a centimeter long! She just keeps making appointments until the haircut is done.
In the limelight
During most of the events that we go to now, the invitation is addressed to her because of her connections and most guests have the same interests as hers. It does not bother me too much that she takes center stage and I think the same applies to her too when we go for events which are addressed to me.
Ramani, by nature, hates to turn down an invitation saying how would you feel when people do the same to you and I end up going to as many events as she does. I just tag along unless I find that there would hardly be anyone with whom I could make conversation. We tend to keep an eye on each other, just to make sure the other is comfortable - or needs help bailing out!
Cooking
Ramani cannot cook to save herself and we would have starved if we had not had our wonderful faithfuls at home! But ask her to plan a meal and like all things she would see that everything is in place
The wife and mother
Ranjith Fernando
In the early days, when the children were small, she had quite a task running a growing family and a thriving business. It was not easy trying to divide time between the two. However, the Sri Lankan culture came to her aid. Her mother and my parents were always there to look after the children and there was peace of mind. Ramani is a fine time manager and at the same time she wants to do everything. The way she juggles so many things at the same time is simply amazing! I think she has developed a simple system of writing down notes on what she has to do and delegating these chores among others. It is certainly an effective way of getting chores done although it is not rocket science.
She is the pivot of the family .Whenever she comes up with an idea its usually turned down by all at first, but later, everyone ends up agreeing wholeheartedly and doing exactly as she plans! She has really mastered the art of being a great mother and wife.
The family
We are the R family: Ranjit, Ramani, Rashika, Rishen, Rehan and Rakhil and our dog, Rocky.
They all do their own thing. Rashika is a Nuclear Radiologist. Rishen is into Software Outsourcing. Rehan is involved in Graphic Designing and Rakhil is running a Startup in Singapore. None of them want to follow what we do. On the theory that since its not broken, why mend it, they wish not to get involved. However they are all great at professing advice and ideas. Ramani is at the receiving end, being the patient listener.
Greatest strength and greatest weakness
She is very caring and loving. When she takes on a task and believes in it, she would painstakingly take it to the finish. These are her greatest strengths. Her inability to say no is her biggest weakness.
Other passions
Ramani is a great family person and loves to be with and pamper the four grandchildren. She was not a sportsperson in her young days but now, she is faithful to her fitness regimes. She tries to follow cricket and watches some of it particularly when I am involved. She even says a prayer for us to win because she is a religious person but her understanding and questions on the game can be funny at times. This is good because two cricket buffs in the family would have been stressful.
Fit and fab
In the early days, I had to push her towards maintaining a fitness regime. Now, she is the one who pushes me.
Animal lovers
Yes, we love animals. There was our first dog, Rudy. She was sadly knocked down and now we have Rocky who was rescued from a dustbin as a pup by some friends and given to us a short time after they left the country. She is Ramanis shadow and truly adores and protects her although we all believe everyone else in the household does more for her. She is about eight years old but I am sad that I cannot pet her because of a fur allergy. We also have twin cats, Suzie and Ritchie, who are a menace but adorable and annoys Rocky loads at times.
Holidaying
We try to plan holidays with the whole family now and that includes our in-laws Tim, Sharika and Shaesta. The destination is usually agreed by consensus. However we always want to spend at least a short time each year in a small village called Lymm near Manchester where our daughter lives because we want to be with our other three grandchildren.
Him vs her
We do have disagreements but the heat settles down fast because Ramani is quick to say sorry even if she thinks she is right. The upside for Ramani is that in any event, her wishes are always carried out.
Three lesser known facts
Ramani makes great howlers while speaking about cricket.
She is a terrible back seat driver.
She becomes a wreck flying with turbulence where she keeps on praying throughout the event.

MR withdrew my entire security for two months: CBK
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga issuing a press release yesterday hit out at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa stating that she was left without any security for two months in the latter part of 2007.
The statement comes in the wake of Joint Oppositions complaints over the reduction of the security detail of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
In September 2007, 15 months after my retirement, President Rajapaksa and his brother Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who was responsible for the entire security apparatus of the Sri Lankan State, instructed the relevant authorities to withdraw every single one of my Security personnel, all vehicles and weaponry. I was left without any Security for two months, she said. She said a small part of her security was reinstated after two months due to repeated concerns expressed by various parties including foreign governments.
Protests by a few MPs of the UNP and several foreign Governments (All MPs and other representatives of the SLFP being forbidden from talking to Chandrika Kumaratunga or taking up any issues on her behalf) compelled the Rajapaksa Government to restore a small part of my Security - 40 Security personnel in all and five vehicles in poor condition. Until the present day, my security remains the same, she remarked.
The release further said: I have watched with amusement the agitation of the Joint Opposition MPs regarding the reduction of the Security accorded to Mahinda Rajapaksa. It is pertinent to remind Rajapaksa of the manner in which he treated another former President and the Security he accorded her.
I retired in November 2005, while the civil war between the State of Sri Lanka and the LTTE was ongoing. The LTTE issued several formal statements announcing that they would attempt to assassinate Chandrika even after her retirement, giving the main reason for this as the take-over of Jaffna from the LTTE by the Kumaratunga Government and clearing Jaffna of the LTTE, compelling the LTTE to limit themselves to the smaller areas of Killinochchi and Mullaitivu. The Special Committee of the Security Council studied my security needs after retirement and suggested that I be given a security detail of 300 personnel with the required vehicles and weaponry. Acting on my usual principle of cutting down Government expenditure to the maximum, I rejected the Security Council proposal and agreed to only 150 personnel and 10 vehicles, including security vehicles.

Mukunuwanna : Eat daily, be healthy!
Mukunuwanna is another must have inclusion when it comes to Sri Lankan Cuisine and is one of the main courses in a meal in Sri Lanka. Garden Talk speaks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture, District Agriculture Instructor K.N.K Jayathilake on this highly popular leafy vegetable which is delicious and nutritious.
Nowadays Sri Lankan consumers are very concerned about eating leafy vegetables and consume them on a daily basis. One reason is that it is highly appetizing and contains quantities of Vitamin, Calcium and Iron. Mukunuwanna can easily be grown in a home garden and has been cultivated in a village or urban home garden since days of old, said Jayathilake.
Mukunuwannna over the years has become so popular when it comes to Sri Lanka gastronomy alongside so many other vegetables.
When it comes to Mukunuwanna it can be used as a curry. It can be used as Kola Kanda. It can also be used as a Salad. It has also value as a medicinal herb. This is because of the high quantities of Vitamin, Calcium and Iron in Mukunuwanna. This is why it is highly recommended to be eaten on a daily basis, stated Jayathilake.
When it comes to Mukunuwanna, it is easy to find planting material and can be easily grown in a home garden. Also it does not take much capital to grow Mukunuwanna.
Commercial value
It also has great commercial value and is cultivated on a commercial basis in Colombo. It can be harvested every month up to a period of two years - which means that every month the farmer can get a good income. After two years you have to cultivate anew. That is a significant feature of Mukunuwanna. This means the cultivator can receive a good income from an acre commercially. When starting to cultivate, it has to be done during the rainy season, pointed out Jayathilake.
l When it comes to cultivation, low country wet zone is ideal, however it needs to be irrigated throughout the year when it comes to the highlands.
l When it comes to the soil, it has to be wet soil with a good drainage system. The soil has to be PH 6.0  7.0.
l The temperature needs to be around 28 Celsius.
l The soil must be fertile and needs organic manure. If the claylike quality in the soil is there, then there needs to be a good drainage system. Also if it is clay you need to include a lot of organic manure.
l When there is less rainfall you need to irrigate  add water. When there is too much rainfall you need a drainage system.
Of course since there is no adequate rainfall during all times of the year, growing Mukunuwanna must be started during the rainy season. When there is inadequate rainfall during the year we irrigate. This is when we are doing it on a commercial basis. In a home garden we can cultivate any time of the year since it is done on a small scale. They can be grown in pots and beds. The soil needs to be fertile. It needs organic manure. In a drought period you need irrigation, explained Jayathilake.
Varieties
There are many varieties of Mukunuwanna. There is the Bush type. Then there is the creeper. When it comes to Creeper it can be further divided when it comes to the shape of the leaf and the color of the stem. One is the
Piliyandala variety. It is a recommended variety. The leaf has an ovate shape and the stem is light green. There is another variety with an ovate leaf, and the stem is brown and green. Then there is another variety which is
Lanceolate in shape with a green or brown stem, explained Jayathilake. The
Bush type is mainly used as an ornamental plant coming in many colors 
Red Mukunuwanna, Green Mukunuwanna and Green and Yellow Mukunuwanna. It is divided according to colors. The Green variety is edible. The other two varieties are not normally consumed by people. These bush type plants can be kept for a length of time by pruning. Mukunuwanna is cultivated by stems/ a cutting. The stem is the planting material. The stem can be 10  12 cm. It can also be grown through seeds. From the flowers the seeds fall to the ground and get planted. They fall naturally to the ground and give rise to the plant, added Jayathilake  Before planting, the soil must be prepared. The weeds must be removed. The weeds cause the harvest to suffer. The quality is low. They cause disease. They suck the nutrients in the soil. It causes competition with the plants.  For a good drainage system you need to make drains (in case of too much rainfall)  The soil must be leveled  You need to irrigate and then only can the cuttings be planted. (In case of drought season)  Also you need to cover with coconut leaves  mulching.  There needs to be a distance between the plants  10cm or 20cm.  There needs to be daily irrigation  Organic manure must be applied 
Poultry Manure and Cow Dung  1 hectare  10 tons of Organic Manure.  Even after planting, you can apply Organic Manure. There are many dangers to the plants by caterpillars that eat the leaves. Since the leaves are lush they are attacked. After planting, in four weeks it can be harvested. Then every month you can reap the harvest.

Mumbai achieve record IPL margin in win over Delhi
NEW DELHI, Saturday  West Indies batsman Lendl Simmons led Mumbai Indians to a 146-run win over hosts Delhi Daredevils as the Indian Premier League Twenty20 tournament witnessed its biggest-ever victory margin on Saturday.
Simmons, who was playing his first game of the IPL season, smashed a 43-ball 66 to help Mumbai post a mammoth 212-3 before his team skittled out Delhi for 66 in 13.4 overs.
Delhi, who held the previous record of biggest win after defeating Pune by 97 runs last month, recorded their lowest IPL total. They were shot out for 67 against Kings XI Punjab earlier this week.
The Rohit Sharma-led Mumbai became the first team to seal a play-off spot while Delhi slumped to its seventh loss in 11 games at their home venue - Feroz Shah Kotla.
Man of the match Simmons hit five fours and four sixes to give Mumbai a solid start as fellow West Indian Kieron Pollard soon took over and smacked an unbeaten 63 in 35 deliveries. Simmons, who replaced England's Jos Buttler in the Mumbai XI, made it a night to remember for the table-toppers with some big hitting and made a quickfire 37-run stand with Pollard.
I'm good as a replacement player, it's been good for me, said Simmons.
Batting with Pollard is good, we are accustomed playing together.
We didn't have a total in mind, we just had a mind towards keeping the run-rate up and not losing wickets at crucial times.
Delhi captain Zaheer Khan praised Simmons and Pollard for taking the game away for the home side, which is struggling at the sixth spot in the eight-team table.
We had our plans, we started well, we stuck to the plan, but the partnership between Lendl and Pollard took the game away from us, said Zaheer.
We have to stay positive, we have to regroup, we have a slight break. But it's all about winning games, playoffs is still possible.  AFP

My security axed seeing massive crowd at JO May Day rally: MR
The government got terribly upset over the massive turnout of people at the Galle Face Joint Opposition May Day rally and withdrew 47 officers from my security detail, Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
No one will be able to halt my march with the people even if my security detail is withdrawn in its entirety, he said.
He was addressing a meeting after unveiling the pinnacle of a new chaitiya at the Welgala Sri Moroththarama Viharaya in the Hiriyala electorate on Saturday.
Mahinda Rajapaksa said people had become helpless and engage in a struggle to survive. The government was fleecing the public by introducing new taxes.
All democratic rights had been usurped and elections were being constantly postponed, he said.
Our next struggle will be to push the government to hold elections. No country had been able to scuttle peoples struggles for liberty. he said.
Rajapaksa said people should rally round to defeat the governing robbers and protect national assets.
They must rally round to steer the country towards unity and harmony by defeating separatism and betrayal of war heroes.
Viharadhipati Ven Hataraliyaddde Narada Nayake Thera, Parliamentarians Salinda Dissanayake and Johnston Fernando and artiste Bandula Wijeweera spoke at the meeting.

Nestl posts Rs. 9.4 bn sales in Q1 amidst tough market conditions
Nestl reported a sales revenue of Rs. 9.4 billion and profit of Rs. 0.9 billion for the first quarter ending 31 March 2017.
The Companys results were impacted by an increase in Value Added Tax, and sluggish consumer demand aggravated by the prevailing drought, reported to be the worst in forty years. The drought has significantly affected fresh coconut crop, leading to an unprecedented increase in coconut prices.
Severe drought leading to depressed consumer demand, and a significant increase in raw material costs, has made the start of this year particularly challenging. With an increasingly challenging business environment, we have put the necessary measures in place to enhance efficiency and offer more value to our consumers  said Shivani Hegde, Nestl Lanka Managing Director.
Nestl recently initiated an investment of over Rs. 4.5 billion in a new manufacturing facility, to expand production capacity for its popular dairy and coconut based products.
Nestl is Sri Lankas largest private sector collector of fresh milk, and one of the worlds largest exporters of coconut milk powder.
Supporting the livelihood of thousands of local farmers and their families, its payment to farmers for procuring these raw materials exceeded Rs. 6 billion in 2016 alone.

Netiquette means networking etiquette
Courtesy and politeness should apply to all aspects of life. Email is now an inextricable part of life. When it comes to your business email activities, underestimating or disregarding courtesy and politeness which lends to a perceived level of professionalism will be at your own peril.
Netiquette, short for network etiquette or internet etiquette, is a set of social conventions that facilitate interaction over networks, ranging from Usenet and mailing lists to blogs and forums. It means respecting other users views and displaying common courtesy especially when posting your views to online discussion groups.
A very real impact
Etiquette in technology is the conduct that is socially acceptable in an online or digital situation. While etiquette is ingrained into culture, etiquette in technology is a fairly recent concept. Although certain rules have been established for correct etiquette while using technology, many users believe that current users are not as well-mannered in etiquette for digital devices, such as the computer or a cell phone.
Social networking provides companies with a user-friendly, fast and far-reaching way to connect with employees and clients. But as with face-to-face meetings, there are certain rules of etiquette that must be followed to achieve the desired outcome.
The Internet is a big, limitless place where the rules of everyday life dont always apply. You can be whoever you want to be and say whatever you want to say, right Well actually, no! You cant or at least, you shouldnt. Especially if your online presence is connected to your professional image. The fact of the matter is, just as there is proper etiquette in the real world, theres a right way and a wrong way to behave in the online world, too. In fact, how you choose to communicate can have a very real impact on your relationships with employees, customers, and partners. For some reason, many people seem to think that using social media gives them a pass to leave manners and etiquette behind. They dont realise that social media can actually be a critical vehicle by which to engage customers and inspire employees.
When you communicate electronically, all you see is a computer screen. You don't have the opportunity to use facial expressions, gestures, and tone of voice to communicate your meaning; words, lonely written words, are all you've got. And that goes for your correspondent as well. You must put as much thought into online communications as you do other forms of communication to make sure your messages are received in the manner you intended.
It's much easier when you're communicating with someone in person, because you can use gestures and vocal inflections to reinforce your message. More important, you can gauge your listener's body language and facial expressions and almost instantaneously clarify misunderstandings by changing a few words.
Replying to e-mails
When you are holding a conversation online, whether it is an e-mail exchange or a response to a discussion group posting it is easy to misinterpret your correspondent's meaning. And it's frighteningly easy to forget that your correspondent is a person with feelings more or less like your own.
It is ironic, really. Computer networks bring people together who would otherwise never meet. But the impersonality of the medium changes that meeting to something less, well lets say less personal. Humans exchanging e-mail often behave the way some road hogs behind the wheel of a car do: They curse at other drivers, make obscene gestures, and generally behave like savages. Most of them would never act that way at work or at home. But the interposition of the machine seems to make it acceptable.
Whether using email for business or personal reasons, it pays to be polite. When it comes to your career, one misinterpreted email could result in limited job opportunities, or lost business. When it comes to family and friends, a hasty or inappropriate response can cost you a relationship. Fortunately, courteous e-mail protocols aren't difficult to learn and remember. Sometimes, all it takes is a dose of common sense.
Be timely when replying to e-mails. Typical turn-around time is 24 hours or less, unless the recipient asked you to reply earlier. Check your e-mail at least twice a day to ensure that you receive any new, and possibly urgent, messages that need a quick response. Not replying to e-mails in a timely manner can delay the recipient in taking needed actions.
The message of Netiquette
Be concise in your e-mails, unless a longer response is needed. Whether for business or personal use, most people don't have or want to spend time wading through extraneous information. Only put what is necessary to communicate your message clearly and omit needless words and details. Always address the e-mail recipient by proper title, in the proper order. For instance, if an e-mail needs to go to the CEO, vice president and your supervisor, list them in that order. Don't list those with lower rank before those with higher, this can be seen as an insult to superiors. In addition, don't needlessly cc or carbon copy, people on e-mails they don't need to read. Although it's often easier to hit the reply all button than to take out specific addresses, clogging up recipient inboxes is sure to be noticed, and certainly not appreciated.
Always keep your emotions in check when writing e-mails. If you are feeling angry or annoyed, don't send a reply right away as your feelings will show in the e-mail. But do make sure you reply within 24 hours. Take steps to calm down, such as having a cup of tea or going for a walk, before crafting a measured response. Once you have sent harsh words through an e-mail, not only are they impossible to take back, but an electronic record of them will exist.Unless you are sending a personal e-mail, use standard font types such as Arial, for example, or Times New Roman and sizes 10 or 12 point. Don't use fancy script fonts or different colours. Just stick to black. Other styles and colours are sometimes difficult to read.
The message of Netiquette is that boorish behaviour is not acceptable. Yes, use your network connections to express yourself freely, explore strange new worlds, and boldly go where you've never gone before. But remember the prime directive of Netiquette: Those are real people out there.

Newcastle win Championship
LONDON, Sunday: Newcastle United sewed up the Championship title on Sunday, beating Barnsley 3-0 to finish above Brighton & Hove Albion and return to the Premier League with a bang on a frantic final day at both ends of England's second-tier.
Brighton finished second after drawing 1-1 at mid-table Aston Villa, while at the other end of the table Nottingham Forest pulled off a narrow escape as 1995 Premier League champions Blackburn Rovers were relegated.
Forest looked set for the drop after Blackburn took a 2-0 first-half lead at Brentford, but Britt Assombalonga scored a penalty to put the twice European champions back in the box seat.
Chris Cohen doubled Forest's lead after the interval and Assombalonga missed a second penalty, but made amends with a powerful shot from inside the area to give Forest a 3-0 victory that kept them up on goal difference. Blackburn's 3-1 victory over Brentford could not prevent them from dropping into the third-tier next season, alongside already relegated Wigan Athletic and Rotherham United.
Goals from Ayoze Perez, Chancel Mbema and Dwight Gayle were enough to help Newcastle and manager Rafa Benitez finish a point above Brighton, whose hopes of winning the title were dashed at the death. Glenn Murray put Brighton ahead from the penalty spot but Jack Grealish levelled for Villa in the 89th minute to break Brighton hearts.
Both Newcastle and Brighton had already secured promotion before Sunday's action.
Birmingham, who were also in danger of relegation and brought in Harry Redknapp as manager last month to help keep them in the Championship, held on for a narrow 1-0 win over Bristol City to stay up, two points clear of Forest and Blackburn.
Reading, Sheffield Wednesday, Huddersfield and Fulham finished in the playoff places and will face off to decide which team wins the final promotion spot to the Premier League.

No new import duty on dates
Baseless news items are published by certain media that new duty has been imposed for dates. Only a special commodity tax of Rs.60 is currently charged for imported dates per kilogram. In addition, no other tax is charged for dates, a statement issued from the Trade and Investment Policies Department said.
A total tax of Rs.130 was charged per kilogram of imported dates by 2015. It consisted of 15 percent Customs duty, 7.5 percent ports and airport duty, 25 percent Cess tax, 11 percent VAT and 2 percent Nation Building tax.
All taxes for dates were abolished when prices of essential commodities were reduced on November 20, 2015 after the Good Governance rule assumed office and, a special commodity tax of Rs.60 per kilogram was introduced instead. This enabled traders to import dates Rs.70 less than that of the price they paid earlier, the statement showed.
In addition, the government has already made necessary monetary allocations for respective ministries in lieu of the taxes they ought to pay for stocks of dates the country receive as donations from foreign countries to be distributed free during special religious events, the statement pointed out.
Participating in the parliament debate with regard to the special gazette notification dated November 21, 2016 in connection with the imposing of special commodity tax, although Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti interpreted this as imposing new tax for dates, this is not imposing any new tax but further extension of the already reduced tax plan for dates maintaining since November 2015, the statement said.
Therefore, all print and electronic media reports published sourcing to the statement made by the JVP MP are untrue and, no new duty has been imposed on import of dates as they are brought to the country during the forthcoming Ramadan festival, the statement stressed.

Over 6,000 migrants rescued in two days
ITALY: Over 6,000 migrants hoping to head to Europe were rescued in the Mediterranean on Friday and Saturday in dozens of frantic operations coordinated by the Italian coastguard.
Some 3,000 were picked up Saturday by the navy, coastguard, EU border agency Frontex and several NGOs, the coastguard said in a statement. Some of them have already been taken to shore in Italy while others, including 730 onboard a ship operated by Doctors Without Borders (MSF), were on their way.
The Libyan coastguard told AFP it had picked up around 170 migrants off Tripoli on Saturday, but had failed to rescue others due to a lack of means. The rescues came a day after around 3,000 others were found floating in rubber boats and on makeshift rafts after having left Libya, heading towards Italy.
The International Organization for Migration meanwhile said fishermen had rescued 371 migrants Friday off the coast of the Libyan town of Zuwara. Italy and Libya have moved to boost cooperation in recent months in order to cut the number of people risking their lives by attempting the dangerous Mediterranean crossing.
The Italian government said in a deal signed with Libya in February that it would offer manpower as well as technical assistance to the Libyan coastguard. Rome said this week that it had delivered two speedboats to Libya at the end of last month, with eight more due by the end of June. Some 37,000 people, many of them sub-Saharan Africans, have arrived in Italy from Libya since the start of the year -- a figure some thirty percent higher than a year earlier, according to the Italian interior ministry. - AFP

PM Modi to visit Sri Lanka on May 11 to attend Vesak Day
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will travel to Sri Lanka on May 11 to attend the biggest Buddhist festival, Vesak Day.
The International Day of Vesak celebrations, to be held in Colombo from May 12 to 14, will include an International Buddhist Conference in which over 400 delegates from more than 100 countries will participate.
Vesak, the most important day in the Buddhist calendar, marks commemoration of Lord Buddhas birth, enlightenment and passing away.
During the two-day trip, his second to Sri Lanka since becoming the Prime Minister, Modi is also likely to visit Kandy in the Central Province, which is famous for production of Ceylon Tea, officials said here today.
In the Central Province, the Prime Minister is expected to address the tea garden workers, the officials said.
He is also expected to visit some Buddhist temples.
Nearly 6,000 police officers will be deployed by the host country as part of special security for Modi, according to the Sri Lankan media reports.
Modi had travelled to Sri Lanka earlier in 2015.
The visit to Sri Lanka comes close on the heels of a trip by his counterpart Ranil Wickremesinghe here.
During that visit, the two countries signed a pact to boost economic ties as Modi and Wickremesinghe discussed a range of bilateral issues and matters of mutual interest.
The pact provides a framework to identify the infrastructure projects where India can invest.
Modi had stressed on Indias commitment to promoting prosperity in the neighbourhood and affirmed the continued support for realising the vision of the Sri Lankan leadership for a stable, peaceful and prosperous Sri Lanka. - PTI

Prayer for no more prey
On April 27, a young girl who ventured out for a swim in the picturesque Bulannatuwa Lake in Galnewa was tragically killed by a crocodile. Villagers in the area allege that there are around 20 crocodiles in this lake.
The crocodile had killed one of their own. Thirteen-year-old S. M. Gimhani Anushika was a resident of No 246, Dorahatha, Lolugaswewa and had been studying in the seventh grade at the Galnewa school. She was the only girl in her family.
Gimhani Anushika
who was killed by a crocodile
She had ventured out to the lake around 6.30 pm on April 27, along with her mother, uncle and two other cousins when she was attacked and killed by a crocodile. This attack has caused fear and panic among the villagers living around the tank and surrounding villagers and they have pressured the authorities to take quick action in dealing with the crocodiles.
Lake full of crocodiles
Bulannatuwa Lake is a large water body which belongs to the Galnewa Divisional Secretariat Division and No. 469 Grama Niladhari division. When the Daily News investigated into the incident, villagers informed us that they had witnessed around 20 crocodiles in the lake and the crocodile which killed the young girl was around 12 ft long and 3 feet wide.
After the attack, the villagers who had attempted to retrace the origins of the crocodile had found a burrow suspected to be its home. They have thereafter, dug it out to find four baby crocodiles inside.
Water bodies are of paramount importance in the dry zone and Bulannatuwa Lake supplies much of the water to surrounding villagers. With the death of Gimhani, the number of people coming to the lake to collect water has considerably reduced.
The villagers also complain that these crocodiles were in the habit of hunting dogs in the area and that in the recent past, two dogs and two calves had become prey to the crocodiles.
The presence of crocodiles in the lake, however, is not new information to the villagers. They have been there for the past 15 years in the lake and despite their presence it was common for villagers to bathe in the lake. This, however, was the first time that a crocodile attacked a human.
Take them out or build a fence
It was my brothers daughter who fell prey to the crocodile in such a tragic manner. With that incident, many of us are in fear of making use of this lake. This is the first time that a child was eaten by a crocodile in this area and the surrounding areas. As long as these crocodiles exist in this lake, there is a danger of such incidents repeating. So we ask the authorities to either remove these crocodiles from here or make our bathing places secure in some way, said P. Shyamali Premalatha, a resident of Lolugaswewa.
I have used this lake for the past 30 years. We did not have so many crocodiles in it before. But in the last 10 years, we have seen an increase in the number of crocodiles in this lake.
As far as we know, there are around 20 crocodiles in this lake. Since the death of the young girl, no one has ventured out to bathe in the lake. It is quite common to find soap foams along the vents in the lake as there are so many people bathing, but now, only leaves and rotten branches fill these vents.
There is much fear among the people to return. So we ask that the authorities construct a protection fence around our bathing areas so we can continue to use it, explained Jayantha Somathilake, another resident from Lolugaswewa.
The Secretary of the 304/T2/T26 Dathusena Farmer Association, D.M. Asanka Pradeep was of the opinion that the crocodiles had started attacking humans having acquired the taste after hunting dogs and calves in the area.
As the Farmer Organization, we have informed the Mahaweli Authority to find a suitable solution to this problem. We ask that they find a solution before another human life is sacrificed to these crocodiles, said Pradeep.
Authorities in a quandary
The incident on April 27 has also triggered the Civil Defence Force in the area to action.
After the incident which occurred a week ago, we have taken several measures to find ways in which we can protect the villagers from crocodiles.
It is not only this lake which has so many crocodiles. We have found that the lakes Siymbalewa, Kataragama, Nelumpathgama, Lolugaswewa and Kalankuttiya too, have similar issues. Crocodile numbers have progressively increased in these lakes over the years, said Galnewa Civil Defence Committee Chairman H. M. Lionel Jayasinghe.
We have got together with the Divisional Secretariat and devised a programme to find out what we can do to deal with this issue. As we too are villagers living here, we hope to take steps to protect the bathing areas in the lake.
I would like to request the authorities to take long term measures to either remove the crocodiles from this lake or find a way to protect the people who come to bathe here, he explained.
Meegalewa Wildlife Office, however, estimated a lesser number of crocodiles in the lake. They said that they had not taken a decision on the crocodiles yet.
We estimate around 10-15 adult crocodiles to be in this lake. But we have not decided whether we are to remove them or not.
We cannot say how these numbers came to increase significantly and nor do we understand how they came to be in these lakes.
They usually follow the waterways looking for food and settle in areas they find most suitable. However, we do know that there have been crocodiles in this lake for the last 10-15 years, said the Wildlife head at Meegalawewa, Nimal Bandara.
He added that they would discuss matters with the villagers and arrive at a suitable compromise.
Galnewa Divisional Secretary E. M. Swarna Edirisinghe speaking to the Daily News admitted that there was fear and panic spreading in the area over the crocodiles and that they were responsible with regard to managing the situation.
Villagers in the Kalankuttiya area, adjacent to Bulannatuwa Lake also complain that they have seen various species of crocodiles after the attack on the young girl.
We will discuss the issue with all stakeholders and decide whether we are to remove the crocodiles from the area or not.
The task of dealing with the crocodiles, however, is the job of the wildlife authorities and we hope to get them involved in our meetings.
We will also see to a fence or safety structure we can build around the bathing areas so the villagers are protected, said Edirisinghe.
Galnewa Police OIC M.M.R.C. Munasinghe meanwhile said they would do their best to protect the people, but there was little they could do to deal with this unusual threat.
We cannot get involved in the decision to remove the crocodiles or not, said the OIC.

President congratulates Indian PM on successfully launching South Asia satellite
President Maithripala Sirisena extended his best wishes to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the occasion of India successfully launching a new communications satellite, which can be utilized by the member countries of SAARC including Sri Lanka. The President congratulated the Indian Prime Minister via satellite technology from the Presidents House in Anuradhapura and said that this is a historic milestone to accomplish progress on cooperation and development among the SAARC countries.
The President also appreciated the commitment by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to strengthen the relationship between the SAARC countries.
The South Asia Satellite is a geosynchronous communications and meteorology satellite by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation region. The satellite was launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh on Friday.
It will help to meet the growing telecommunications and broadcasting needs of the region. The satellite will provide, among other things, communication channels for better coordination during disaster management. It will also help countries in mapping terrain and natural resources.
President Sirisena said as this will be networked with all SAARC countries, and Sri Lanka as a partner in this effort, it can benefit from this satellite to develop infrastructure facilities in a more successful manner. He said that he believed this satellite would help to uplift the economic and social standard of the people.

Preventing Shin Splints
This week Consultant Rheumatologist and Specialist in Sports Medicine attached to Nawaloka Hospitals PLC Dr. Harindu Wijesinghe (MBBS, MD, MRCP), speaks about Shin Splints, one of the health issues that affect many in our society, especially sportsmen.
Q - What is Shin Splints
A - The term "shin splints" refers to pain along the shin bone (tibia)- the large bone in the front of your lower leg. Medically known as medial tibial stress syndrome, shin splints often occur in people or athletes who have recently increased their exercise routines. The increased activity overworks the muscles, tendons which are attached to the shin bone irritating the bone tissue. This leads to pain.Fortunately, this is self-healing and with rest it will get better.Usually the pain settles in a few weeks.
Q - Who develops it how and when
A  This can occur in anyone who suddenly does a lot of impact training such as running jumping etc. It especially occurs when people change the intensity (ex-running/walking speed,) frequency (number of days per week) or duration (length of exercise) of their exercise too soon.
The pain associated with shin splints results from excessive amounts of force on the shin bone and the tissues attaching the shin bone to the muscles surrounding it. The excessive force causes the muscles to swell and increases the pressure against the bone, leading to pain and inflammation.
Q - What is the connection between a stress fracture and shin splints 
Dr. HarinduWijesinghe
A  If pain from shin splints is ignored and training is continued it can lead to stress fracture.
This occurs as the constant pounding of excessive impact exercise and training causes minute cracks in the bones of the leg.
The body can repair the cracks if it gets time to rest.
However, if the body doesnt get time to rest, the tiny cracks can result in a complete fracture or a stress fracture.
Q  What treatment options are available
A - When shin splints occur you should stop running completely and decrease your training depending on the extent and duration of pain.
Then, as a first step, ice your shin to reduce inflammation.
Pain killers can help to lessen the pain and inflammation.
Gentle stretches for the calf and Achilles will help. Following this, strengthening is started. Patients can resume non-weight bearing activities such as cycling, swimming.
Once pain is reduced they can start walking followed by jogging which is increased gradually.
When you return to running, increase your mileage slowly, no more than 10 percent weekly.
Q - How can we prevent Shin Splints
A - When you increase your training increase the intensity of exercise or training no more than 10 percent weekly.
Remember there are three training variables intensity (ex-running/walking speed), frequency (number of days per week) or duration (length of exercise).
As a rule, you must gradually increase only one component at a time.
Make sure you wear the correct running shoes for your foot. Have two pairs of shoes and alternate wearing them to vary the stresses on your legs if you are running a lot.
Avoid hills and excessively hard surfaces when possible and specially if you have shin pain.
Stretch your calves and Achilles regularly as a preventive measure.
Engage in strength training, specially to strengthen leg muscles.
If you are overweight start with non-weight bearing exercises like cycling, cross trainers and swimming.

Rajans recover from poor start to beat Vidyartha
At Nittawela yesterday a good game of rugby was witnessed between Dharmaraja College and Vidyartha College in their Plate trophy second round match. Dharmaraja beat Vidyartha after a poor first half by 36 points (3 goals, 3 tries) to 16 (1 goal, 3 penalties).
Vidyartha who are playing in the top division after five long years fared creditably in holding the powerful Rajans side playing some good rugby. Vidyartha led 9-7 at half time.
After the breather the rains came down and Rajans played better and made Vidyartha defend. Rajans were well served by their forwards to the three-quarter line, and they pressed strongly in the second half.
Vidyartha failed to play the same game as in the first half and Rajans using their knowledge scored the points to turn the game in their favour. Referee: Nalin Lasantha

Rampant Real thrash Granada
BARCELONA, Saturday - Real Madrid produced a ruthless first-half display to thrash already-relegated Granada 4-0 on Saturday and remain on course for a first league title in five years, while Barcelona hammered Villarreal 4-1.
James Rodriguez put Zinedine Zidane's side in charge in the third minute by bundling in Lucas Vazquez's arrowed cross and then headed in a cross from forgotten man Fabio Coentrao to double their lead in the 11th, scoring for the fifth time in four games.
Alvaro Morata followed the Colombian's early strikes with two goals of his own in the 30th and 35th to kill off Tony Adams's sunken side and put Real level on 84 points with champions Barca.
Every opponent gives you a difficult game but we started the game really well and scored early, said Morata.
We've got difficult games to come but we're very good, we have 24 players that always want to play and we need to keep going like this and go for the league title. Barca lead the standings due to their superior head-to-head record although Real have a game in hand and will win a first domestic title since 2012 if they take seven points from their remaining three games.
Real could also win a league and European Cup double for the first time since 1958 as they are 3-0 up in their Champions League semi-final tie with Atletico Madrid, with the second leg taking place on Wednesday. Barca's formidable front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar all scored as the champions inflicted the heaviest league defeat of the season on Villarreal, who have the second best defensive record in Spain's top flight.
Neymar was in sensational form in his second game back from suspension and nudged Barcelona ahead in the 21st minute after pouncing on a deflected pass from Messi. Cedric Bakambu fired Villarreal level in the 32nd after beating the offside trap to latch on to a clever through ball from Roberto Soldado.  Agencies

B.A. Sanjeewa Kumara Jayalath comprehensively won the May edition of the Pin Fernando Grand Prix 2017 by a comfortable 9 strokes from M U Chanaka Perera, who took second place from Vinoth Kumar by one stroke.
The event was powered by Cat Solar and sponsored by United Tractor & Equipment Ltd (UTE).
It was refreshing to note that young Chanaka Perera and Vinoth Kumar of Nuwara Eliya, currently based in Qatar, and Chalitha Pushpika and Pradeep Bandara finish in the top 6. Lamindu Rainika the only junior to qualify occupied 7th place and also won the special junior prize in the PFGP May edition.
The final round was very challenging with some difficult pin positions and the picturesque Nuwara Eliya golf course was more challenging than it seemed. The winner B A Sanjeewa was 10 over par for the 4 rounds and scoring at the NEGC course was difficult.
Nonetheless, the Sri Lanka Open 2017 for Professionals and Amateurs is scheduled for July, whilst the 130th Sri Lanka Amateur Golf Championship has been rescheduled from October 16 to 22, to be conducted in Little England at the Nuwara Eliya Golf Club.

Madrid: Maria Sharapova set up a mouth-watering second-round clash with Eugenie Bouchard at the Madrid Open after battling back from a set down to beat Mirjana Lucic-Baroni 4-6, 6-4, 6-0 on Sunday.
Bouchard called the Russian "a cheater" last week and suggested she should have been banned for life -- rather than 15 months -- after testing positive for meldonium at the 2015 Australian Open.
And the Canadian said she would have "a bit more motivation" against her former idol Sharapova after registering a first win on the WTA Tour since January against Alize Cornet on Saturday to set up the grudge match.
"My tennis speaks for itself, and that's what I focus on," said Sharapova, 30, whose immediate return after her ban has gone down badly with some of her fellow players.
"I love being quiet about it and letting everyone around speak or have the noise."
Despite the controversy surrounding the decision to hand her a wildcard, Sharapova was given a warm reception by the sparse crowd on the main Manolo Santana court in the Spanish capital. AFP

SL border stone kept in Adams bridge area
A border stone with the words Sri Lanka inscribed on it and with the Island-governments official emblem on top has been found to have been installed on the seventh of the chain of limestone shoals (islets) in the Adams Bridge area in the shallow seas off Dhansuhkodi, to apparently indicate Sri Lankas maritime border with India.
Adams Bridge or Ram Sethu (bridge over the sea) as found mentioned in the Indian epic Ramayana, comprises a chain of limestone shoals surrounded by shallow sea, that was once believed to have interlinked Rameswaram Island in India with Mannar off the northwestern coast of Sri Lanka, it may be recalled.
The 30-km long bridge-like structure- whether it was man-made or natural formation is still a point of debate, separates the Gulf of Mannar from the Palk Strait in the Bay of Bengal near here.
Tamil Nadu fishermen often run into trouble in the ocean waters close to Katchatheevu islet, with the Sri Lankan Navy charging the former with poaching into their territorial waters as the maritime boundary line cannot be clearly demarcated in full.
While India has installed its territorial sign board on the fifth of these chain of islets comprising Adams Bridge off Dhanushkodi, some fishermen of Rameswaram who put out to sea on Friday have now, reportedly for the first time, found that Sri Lanka has put up its border stone on the seventh islet.
They returned home and reported the matter to the authorities here, according to M. Murugesan, a fisherman who was part of the group who noticed it. DECCAN CHRONICLE.

An official attached to CERT told NewsIn.Asia that CERT has been monitoring all the media reports which had been published in recent months on the Blue Whale suicide challenge, and urged parents in Sri Lanka to monitor their childrens internet movements.
While investigators around the world have not been able to link any suicides directly to the game, we urge the children and parents to stay away from dangerous groups on the internet. Each one must know what is good and bad and what is bad should be avoided, the officialsaid.
While there had been no official complaints lodged against the game to CERT, the official said CERT had been following the media reports regarding the game.
Panic has spread in many countries globally after reports alleged that several teen suicides may have been linked to the Blue Whale suicide challenge which requires a player to end their lives in order to win the game.
The game is said to have originated from Russiaand may now be finding its way around the globe.
According to Yahoo News, the Blue Whale reportedly targets players between 10 and 14 years old, pushing them into completing a list of pained daily tasks such as waking up in the middle of the night, cutting shapes into their skin or contemplating death.
As the game progresses over several weeks, participants reach a final task  committing suicide.
The game that has been spreading online among teens has led to warnings from police across Europe and Russia, Central Asia and North and South America.
According to media reports and investigations, the game involves players being given a master that will control them and make them do tasks every day for 50 days.
Some of thetasks that are being carried out include such as waking up in the middle of the night toscratching a blue whale somewhere on their body.
On the 50th day the masters behind the game instruct the young people to commit suicide and sadly across the world some have done this, reports said.
According to the Sun,Philip Budeikin, the inventor of the game, was arrested in late 2016 in Russia.
At the time of his arrest, he said: Yes, I did and they died happy. I gave them what they do not have in real life: comprehension, communication and warmth.

Sri Lanka can now enter European market: PM
The Export Market is the only avenue available to develop the countrys economy. Now the European market has opened its doors to Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Earlier, I discussed this matter when I became Prime Minister in 2003. But the government which followed rejected the proposal to enter the European market which was grabbed by Bangladesh. Today, Bangladesh owned foreign exchange reserves five times more than Sri Lanka. It has attained this progress because it made use of the opportunities lost to Sri Lanka as well as their own opportunities, the Prime Minister said.
He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating a Youth Agricultural Export Village in the Uva Paranagama electorate on May 5.
The Prime Minister said 40 years ago former President J. R. Jayewardene launched the countrys economy by connecting it to the world market. Although the export economy suffered a setback owing to the war, it made a revival after ending the war in 2009. Earlier, Sri Lanka had only obtained local commercial loans. But the country became bankrupt when the previous government started taking foreign commercial loans beyond its repaying capability. It was during such a scenario that a change of government occurred in the country.
After the victory of Maithripala Sirisena as the common candidate, a National Government was set up with the objective of overcoming the countrys debt burden.
The first duty of the government was to increase national income. People who avoided paying taxes were netted into the tax regime. VAT was increased amidst wide-scale protests. But now these measures had helped to increase government revenue. As a consequence, the government had been able to cut down on loans necessary to maintain its administration, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Premier said next year alone, the government had to repay Rs. 960,000 million in foreign loans. These were loans obtained during 2007, 2008 and 2009. During the four years thereafter, the total repayable foreign loans amounted to US $ 1,500 million. This was a staggering amount which would make us faint, he said.
Now the government had to develop the country while prudently managing the debt burden. The governments objective was to build a strong economy which would enable the country to repay loans by 2020, he said.
In order to develop the economy, we had to capture not only the European market but also the markets in India and China, he added.
Since the government had been able to increase national income last year, it was in a position to move towards development. Its objective was to achieve development by enriching the country through an export economy. We had to compete with the markets in Singapore, France and Shanghai. The country had already proved its ability to do so in respect of the garment sector, he said.
The Prime Minister said India had agreed to join hands to develop Trincomalee. One such project was to develop the Trincomalee oil storage complex as a joint venture.
It would never adversely affect the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. We would be able to store fuel in Trincomalee and sell it to India and thereby earn a sizeable income. More and more industries too had to be set up in Trincomalee. A joint committee would be set up in association with India to implement this development plan. Japan too would join in this endeavour.
India would also build a solar energy electricity plant in Sampur and an LNG electricity plant in Kerawalapitiya. Japanese investors would build another electricity plant. The floating LNG terminal would be jointly operated by Sri Lanka, India and Japan.
An Indian firm had agreed to set up an industrial zone in the South with Indian investors.
A Thai firm had arrived to build a 1000 acre trade zone in Kalutara. There would be three industrial zones in Wayamba in addition to industrial zones in Hambantota and Wellawaya.
He said he visited Uva Paranagama on the invitation of Provincial Agriculture Minister Upali Samaraweera to review the development work undertaken by him in the area.
Upali Samaraweeras objective was to establish a youth agricultural export village in the area. The Ministry of Primary Industries was funding the project. More funds would be provided for the project once the plans were submitted.
He said land value in the area would skyrocket when the Thalpitigala Reservoir Project was completed.

Sri Lanka recovering to reach envisaged economic objectives: Ravi
"Sri Lankas economy has shown tremendous resilience in the past countering many adverse situations," Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
He said the governments strategies to improve growth and dilute the debt servicing could ensure a noteworthy contribution towards the expected evolution of the Asian and Pacific region.
He was addressing the 50th Annual Meeting opening session of the ADBs Board of Governors in Yokohama, Japan on Saturday.
The Minister said the Sri Lankan economic growth was somewhat retarded in 2016 due to bad weather conditions, but the country was positively recovering to reach envisaged economic objectives enumerated in the governments 2017 budgetary proposals themed, Accelerating Growth with Social Inclusion". Karunanayake paid accolades for ADBs contribution to bolster the Sri Lanka economy. ADBs cumulative lending, grant, and technical assistance approvals for Sri Lanka stands as US$ 8.43 billion and ADBs cumulative non-sovereign financing by product for Sri Lanka has reached US$ 560 million. For 2016, the approved loans, grants, and technical assistance amounted to US$ 714, million. In the last five years ADBs co-financing to Sri Lanka toped US$ 2.3 billion.

Standard Chartered lead manages record oversubscribed Intl Bond Issue for SL
Standard Chartered has successfully priced a USD 1.5 billion 10 Year Fixed Rate Senior Unsecured 144A / Reg S issuance for Sri Lanka. This marks the sovereigns eleventh US dollar benchmark offering in the international bond markets since 2007 and reflects the continued international institutional support for Sri Lanka through the years.
Jim McCabe, Chief Executive Officer, Standard Chartered, commenting on the deal said: Road shows conducted by the team in the US, UK, Middle East and Asia helped build up market momentum and have brought in over USD 11 billion in orders from a record 500 Investors. The transaction priced well inside the initial price guidance of 6.625% area, represents a price tightening of 42.5bps. This is the maximum price tightening ever achieved by a Sri Lankan issuer.
While the market was still anxious about the US non-farm payroll data later in the week and the result of the French elections over the weekend, the positivity created by the IMF announcement was clearly reflected in the strong order book.
The orders grew swiftly, with books garnering strong demand from institutional investors in Asia and were fully covered in the first couple of hours. Investor interest from quality accounts allowed the book runners to indicate an aggressive final price guidance of 6.25% (+/-5bp) and the deal was successfully valued at the tighter end of final price guidance at 6.20%.
Lakshan Goonetilleke, Head of Financial Institutions, Standard Chartered stated: The transaction was extremely well timed. The Central Bank took advantage of a window of opportunity post the announcement of the staff level agreement with the IMF and just before the French elections, when investors were looking to buy strong emerging market bonds. The 7 time over subscription reflects the confidence investors have in Sri Lanka and its long term prospects.
Standard Chartered continues to remain a dominant player in Asia and has lead managed all the international issuances by the Government of Sri Lanka since 2014, evidencing the Banks strong relationship founded on continuous engagement and a committed local presence.

The Sri Pada pilgrim season concludes on Vesak Poya day this year. The six months thereafter up to next Unduwap Poya Day is the off season, said Sri Pada Sthanadhipathi and Chancellor Uva-Wellassa University Ven Bengamuwe Dhammadinna Thera.
Although local and foreign pilgrims undertake the pilgrimage to Sri Pada during the off-season too, climbing the mountain would not be permitted during night, Ven Dhammadinna Thera said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Nallathanniya Buddhist centre, Ven Dhammadinna said the decision to prohibit trekking during the night was taken to protect the sanctity of the sacred place. Last year, a group which undertook the trek at night had been involved in grave misconduct which aimed to undermine communal harmony.
He said after concluding the pilgrim season at midnight on May 10, the statue of God Saman and other sacred objects Deva Abharana would be conveyed from the Uda Maluwa to the Galpottawala Raja Maha Viharaya along three routes the following (May 11) morning.

Why we keep looking for lost jungle cities
Dry, desolate landscapes tend to preserve any evidence of human passagethey cling to artifacts like precious memories. A Tyrolean glacier hugged the 5,300-year-old iceman to its breast. The desert helped the ancient Egyptians launch their earthly vessels into eternity. More recently, Antarctica has joined in. The frozen continent recently coughed up a 104-year-old biscuit left by an expedition of Ernest Shackletonsin pristine, perfectly nutritious state.
The jungle, though, does not take naturally to cultural preservation. The obscuring overgrowth never stops; the landscape digests all. Excavating a 5-year-old site, let alone a 500-year-old one, can be like sifting through a well-advanced compost pile in search of something edible. And yet, we tryespecially when inspired by a figure as captivating as Colonel Percy Fawcett.
Fawcett was an intrepid British explorer who disappeared in the Brazilian Amazon in 1925, presumably killed by Indians. Hes the subject of a new biopic, The Lost City of Z, an adaptation of David Granns 2009 book of the same name. The Amazons greatest cover-up, Fawcett believed, was an utterly forgotten civilization named Z. He aimed, in his quasi-invincible, slightly nutty way, to find it.
*
Plenty of Fawcett freaks have emerged in recent decades, taking the explorers mad quest as a starting point for their own, and archivists and other gatekeepers have learned to be wary of them. Grann knew all about the Fawcett bug; he just didnt expect to catch it. Having recently torn through The Lost City of Z and James Grays new film, Im feeling a bit exposed to the contagion myself.
Fawcett was both a product of his momenta twilight era for old-school explorers, but a new day of technological possibilitiesand a rebel against it. The film paints his iconoclasm in rather broad strokes. Yes, he was more open-minded about indigenous Amazonians than many of his contemporaries, but as Grann points out, his racial attitudes were a tangle of conflicting inputs. He absorbed the diffusionist thinking of the era, which glamorized the exotic whereabouts of the lost tribes of Israel and not, say, the intricacies of indigenous cosmology. Fawcett divided Amazon Indians into three kinds, two of which he did not consider very interesting. Those capable of building Z he placed in the third group. They were of civilized origin and (surprise, surprise) fairer skinned than the others.
Its easy to bash colonial explorers, and its undeniable that their high-profile displays of stamina and couragewhat the Victorians called bottomserved a racist imperialism. Even so, theres something transfixing about Fawcett, who ventured into uncharted realms with little more than a machete, a compass, and an almost divine sense of purpose, marvels Grann, and benefited from an uncanny resistance to tropical disease. His fortitude, documented by an admiring press, challenged late-imperial anxieties that British men were getting soft.
Its also pretty clear he had a nasty sidehe was quick to abandon anyone who slowed him down in the junglebut the filmmakers play up his virtues. He approached hostile tribes with his hands in the air, sometimes singing or playing music, a technique that became the stuff of legend. He made his men commit never to use their firearms against Indians. While his peers at the Royal Geographical Society judged these radical departures to be suicidal, the methods served his purposes well, and he seems in retrospect to have helped establish some healthy norms for the emerging field of anthropology.
Fawcetts geographic pursuits overlapped with his interest in the spiritualism that gained traction in Britain during his young adulthood. He attended sances and contributed to a journal called The Occult Review.

The UN sponsored International Vesak Day in Sri Lanka from May 12 to 14, gives all Sri Lankans a wonderful opportunity to show the world the existence of live and vibrant religious unity in the country, Ven. Yatimalagala Sumanasara Thera said.
Executive Director of the Pattivila Dhamma Voice International Buddhist Centre,( (Dhaham Handa) and Help International, Adviser to the Qing Liang Temple, Singapore and Executive Director of the South East Asian Buddhist Forum (SEABFO), the Thera said in a message congratulating those behind the scene that the event including the World Buddhist Conference on the theme Buddhist Teachings Show the Path to Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace, during the International Vesak Day celebration in Sri Lanka opens new vistas to Sri Lanka and gives the world humanity to grasp the spirit of the teachings of the Buddha to a world struggling to live in peace and harmony.
Let this UN sponsored Vesak Day be a show of gratitude of the World Buddhists Fraternity towards the late Sri Lanka Foreign Affairs Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar by recalling the pioneering role played by him in making a dream come true, by the proposal he made way back in 1999, and letting the United Nation declared the Vesak Poya Day an international holiday of great religious significance, the message said.
The message also highlights what the late Sri Lanka Foreign Affairs Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar had said tabling the proposal at the UNGA in September 1999: It would be fitting to recall the immense contribution to the understanding of the human condition that the teachings of the Buddha made 2,500 ago and that it would be appropriate to honour the Buddha by declaring that Vesak, the sacred day for Buddhists the world over, be observed as a special day by the United Nations.
We are glad over the opportunity Sri Lanka has got to host the UN sponsored Vesak Day this year as the country that proposed let the Vesak Day be a international day of observance almost 13 years after the first UN sponsored Vesak Day held in 2004 in the country, the message added.

Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya complains that the Megapolis and Western Development Minister is sole responsibility for the Meethotamulla dumpsite collapse. The responsibility to manage the dumpsite falls under the responsibility of the Colombo Municipal Council and the Municipal Councils fall under the control of the Provincial Council. Therefore it is the Western Provincial Council that is responsible, the Minister said.
The Minister further challenged Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya to an open dialogue, saying however that with or without a dialogue, the Western Provincial Council was to blame for the Meethotamulla tragedy.

Asian Development Bankss co-financing operations has hit a new record in 2016, exceeding the $14 billion mark and reflecting the importance of partnerships in addressing Asia and the Pacifics continuously growing development needs, says a new ADB report.
As stated in its new Partnering for Development: Donor Report 2016, ADB leveraged $14.06 billion in cofinancing last year, boosting the banks total annual operations to $31.7 billion  the highest ever in ADBs 50-year history.
Of the total cofinancing, a record $8.46 billion was mobilized through official and other concessional financing sources, an increase of 37% from 2015, while commercial cofinancing sources accounted for $5.6 billion.
Our operational performance in 2016 proves that ADBs partnerships with bilateral and multilateral organizations, trust funds, other public agencies, and foundations remain as strong as ever, said Kai Preugschat, Head of ADBs Office of Cofinancing Operations.
The report includes key partnership milestones in 2016 such as the renewed cofinancing arrangements with AgenceFranaise de Dveloppement, the Eurasian Development Bank, and the OPEC Fund for International Development. These will bring in potential additional cofinancing of $3.1 billion in the next few years.
ADB successfully engaged new partners in 2016, entering into cofinancing agreements with the Bank of Beijing for an energy project in the Peoples Republic of China, and with the Saudi Fund for Development for a transport project in the Kyrgyz Republic.
Two new trust funds were also established last year, according to the report. ADB and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) established the Leading Asias Private Sector Infrastructure Fund to support private infrastructure investments in Asia and the Pacific. The fund is capitalized by $1.5 billion in equity from JICA and will help mobilize $6 billion in investments. In addition, the multi-donor Project Readiness Improvement Trust Fund (PRIF) was established to help countries in the Southeast Asian region improve project readiness and develop climate-resilient projects. The Nordic Development Fund became the first contributor with 7 million ($7.66 million) to the PRIF.
The renewed commitment and additional resources from our financing partners is crucial to scale up ADB operations as we prepare to meet the Sustainable Development Goals and our climate change commitments, said. Preugschat. We are therefore grateful to our partners for their continued support to ADB.
The Donor Report 2016 also highlights ADBs efforts towards stronger accountability to both its developing member countries and financing partners through the sharing of success stories and results from cofinanced projects.
ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Established in 1966, ADB is celebrating 50 years of development partnership in the region. It is owned by 67 members  48 from the region.

Agent involved in bid to spirit away four Sri Lankans to UK
Nearly two months after four Lankans were arrested for allegedly trying to fly off to London from the Sahar airport using fake passports, one of the two agents who allegedly tried to facilitate their passage to Europe was arrested on Friday.
The accused, Rayappen Thevakumaran (52), against whom a lookout circular had been issued, was arrested when he landed at the Mangaluru Airport on Thursday.
He was brought to Mumbai on Friday and a Magistrates Court sent him to police custody till May 9.
On March 10 this year, four Sri Lankans and four UK nationals were arrested for forgery and human trafficking.
The four UK nationals - Bower Oliver (27), Quillian Alan (43), Fivehats Captain (56), Warner Ann (36) - had been offered a paid trip to India and, in return, they had to help the four Lankans - Arunasalam Shuthakaran (34), Kannathasan Karththeepan (26), Gajan Chandrabalan (31) and Kandasamy Kaveenthiri (26) - to the UK. An Indian, Sunil Soni (29), who was their local contact, was also arrested.
At the Sahar airport, the UK nationals allegedly handed over their boarding passes to the Lankans who had managed to skip immigration.
The plan was to let the Lankans fly off to London on fake identities of the UK nationals their the four Brits would stay on in India on tourist visas which had been provided by Soni, police said.
Thevakumaran was arrested after immigration officials at Mangaluru alerted us about his arrival after they identified him based on the circular issued against him, a senior inspector of the Sahar police station, BT Mukhedkar said.
He is one of the two who introduced the four Lankans held with the four UK nationals who exchanged their boarding passes. Soni, a salesman, had helped the agents to get SIM cards for the UK nationals, the inspector said. - Times of India

Alvarez pummels Chavez in lopsided victory
LOS ANGELES: Saul Canelo Alvarez cruised to a unanimous decision win over Julio Chavez Jr. in a 12-round beatdown to claim Mexican bragging rights on Cinco de Mayo weekend in Las Vegas on Saturday.
The 26-year-old Alvarez used Chavez for target practice, landing jabs, hooks and combinations at will as he won every round of the 164-pound (75 kg) fight on all three judges' scorecards. Chavez, who has a four inch (10 cm) height advantage, was booed during and after the fight by the standing room only crowd at the T-Mobile Arena.
Alvarez treated the lopsided bout as if it were a sparring session in the gym, even standing up between rounds for the entire fight. He landed 228 punches to just 71 for Chavez and an incredible 31 percent of his jabs connected as he had his way with former champion Chavez, who has largely made his career off the name of his famous boxing champion father Julio Cesar Chavez Sr. Alvarez.

Always Dreaming wins 143rd Kentucky Derby
LOS ANGELES, Sunday  Always Dreaming won the 143rd Kentucky Derby on Saturday, pulling away in the final straight on a sloppy track at Churchill Downs in Louisville to claim the first jewel in US flat racing's Triple Crown.
The triumph gave both jockey John Velazquez and trainer Todd Pletcher a second Kentucky Derby victory, but their first together.
Pletcher saddled 2010 Kentucky Derby winner Super Saver, while Velazquez was aboard 2011 winner Animal Kingdom.
It means a lot, Velazquez said of winning with Pletcher, the trainer he has teamed with so successfully over the years.
We have so much success in the past and we haven't won the Derby (together). Finally we got it together with this horse -- incredible horse.
Lookin at Lee finished second from the first post with Battle of Midway third.
It's even more sweet this time, said Pletcher, whose three runners in this year's Derby took his total of entrants in the Run for the Roses over his career to 48.
Between them, he and Velazquez were two-for-63 in the fabled race that kicks off the coveted treble completed by the Preakness and Belmont Stakes.
You know, there has been a lot of talk about our Derby record, an emotional Pletcher said. We were hoping for another one, and this one is all the more sweet. Thanks to support from the bettors -- based on a stellar showing in the Florida Derby on April 1 and strong workouts since -- Always Dreaming was sent off at 9-2 and became the fifth straight betting favorite to win the Kentucky Derby.
Under Velazquez, he broke well from the fifth post and was always near the front. State of Honor set the early pace, with Battle of Midway and Irish War Cry near the lead.
Always Dreaming hit the front going into the final turn. He withstood a challenge from Irish War Cry before pulling away in the straight to leave the late charging Lookin At Lee, a 33-1 shot trained by Steve Asmussen and ridden by Corey Lanerie, to finish second 2 3/4 lengths behind.
Battle of Midway, trained by Jerry Hollendorfer and riden by Flavien Prat, held on for third at 40-1.
Todd and I talked about it -- just make sure you come out running and get a position you would like to have, Velazquez said of his intentions for his relatively inexperienced mount.
Once he got a comfortable position on the turn with the other horses I went to the outside. He got into the bridle beautiful in the backstretch. From then on we sat there until the quarter pole when I asked him to run.
Pletcher admitted to a few anxious moments during the race.
I was a little worried on the back side. I thought a couple of times he wasn't completely in the bridle, Pletcher said. But I could tell Johnny was riding him very confidently. Pletcher also noticed Irish War Cry's jockey Rajiv Maragh peek under his shoulder as they headed into the stretch like he thought he had a lot of horse.
By that time, Velazquez said, he knew any challengers were going to have to run really hard to get him, because he was really running. Classic Empire, winner of the 2016 Breeders Cup Juvenile and the morning line favorite, was jostled at the start. He raced wide in the middle of the 20-horse field down the backstretch and rallied to finish fourth.

[APPRECIATIONS - (08-05-2017)]
Rev. Sr. Charmaine Mendis
Voice of the voiceless
Rev. Sr. Charmaine Mendis, who brightened the lives of deaf children of Sri Lanka for over five decades, left for her eternal rest on April 5.
Enduring cellulitis for a number of years with a swollen leg, suffering a hip fracture and difficulty in swallowing and breathing, she led an active life for 82 years. She passed away while chatting with her comrade nuns at the convent. Rev. Sr. Mendis belonged to the Congregation of Sisters of Perpetual Succor at Periyamulla, Negombo, and she was on the staff of St. Josephs Deaf School for the 53rd year when she passed away.
Rehabilitation of deaf children in Sri Lanka was the prime task of the Sisters of Perpetual Succor to which Sr. Charmaine thoroughly adhered to. She qualified in the field of deafness, specializing in the education of the deaf and audiology at the universities of Dublin and Salford in Ireland and Victoria University of Manchester in the United Kingdom. She returned to Sri Lanka after graduation in 1964 and from that time to date, there was no other person equally qualified in educating the deaf as Sr. Charmaine in Sri Lanka did.
The Education Dept. sought her assistance in the training programmes of the Government Teacher Training College at Maharagama and the National Institute of Education. She was the Audiometrician in the National Council for the Deaf for many years. She represented Sri Lanka at several international conferences on deafness held in the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, China and Australia. She brought much honour to Sri Lanka by her participation in these conferences.
Besides the international arena, Sr. Charmaines sweat was shed beyond bounds on Sri Lankan deaf children. She was attached to the staff of St. Josephs School for the Deaf, Ragama, for many years where she was the Principal from 1973 to 1976. Out of the 21 schools for the deaf in Sri Lanka, St. Josephs, Ragama, takes the pride of place in all Government examinationsGCE O/L and A/L. Many children obtained A and B passes and some were selected to the university. She advocated Total Communication, a mixture of verbal and sign language more than mere signs.
The Association of Parents of Deaf Children initiated by Sr. Charmaine in 1971 and continuing to date, renders yeoman service in the field of deafness not only to deaf children and their parents, but also to teachers of the deaf, public institutes and the general public.
A spate of programmes on Awareness of Deafness, which was very popular, was conducted in seven districts, mainly to young parents of deaf children. The Association launches talent building projects for deaf school children in art, dance, drama and sports every year and the children profit immensely by these. This year, the All-Island deaf Schools Art Competition was held in March and the Dance Competition will be held on May 27. The winners will receive trophies and other awards from a chief guest at the awards ceremony to be held at the D.S. Jayasinghe Hall in Dehiwala.
At the request of the Association, Sr. Charmaine have conducted nine special training programmes for Teachers of the Deaf and about 200 teachers who completed the programme were given special consideration by the Deaf Unit of the Special Education Department. All 16 facilitators of her training programme were university lecturers and professors and nearly all participants have commented that the course was superior to the course conducted by the Govt. Teacher Training College. As Course Director, Sr. Charmaine took a lot of pain to maintain its standards.
Deaf youths interests are looked after by the Association with regard to vocational training and employment. The youth are directed to the German Technical College or similar places of training and they are found employment for those who wish to work as tailors, in poultry farming or otherwise.
Deaf youth, both male and female, envisage problems in finding marriage partners and have been requesting the Association to assist in this situation. The Association, in response, to the request holds encounters for marriage aspirants along with their parents. There is a big demand for this service and many have found their partners through the three encounters held each year.
Sr. Charmaines constant complaint was that there werent sufficiently-qualified officers in the Ministry and Dept. of Education for deaf education matters. Therefore, it was very difficult to convince the authorities of the needs of deaf children. There was not a single qualified officer in both these sections, the ones available being qualified in visually-handicapped or mentally-retarded areas. Sr. Charmaine was always opposed to the calling of tenders for hearing aids and distributing them among deaf children regardless of audiograms. An audiorgram shows the accurate hearing loss a deaf child has and accordingly a suitable hearing aid should be customised for the child by an audiometrician. Sr. Charmaine regretted this faulty move of the Dept. of Social Services as the deaf children did not reap sufficient benefit from the hearing aids. She also pleaded with the Govt. to exempt the tax component on the ear-mould material and hearing aid batteries imported from abroad.
Her own audiology laboratory was maintained by herself and she tested the hearing of numerous children and produced correct audiograms. This was a great help to the poor deaf childrens parents as she only charged a nominal fee for the tests. From morning till evening, she was grappling with deaf childrens problems, meeting parents for consultation and never got tired of this service. As parents of deaf children are comparatively poor, she launched a plan to mitigate their financial strains. Sr. Charmaine, born to a wealthy family, got the help of relatives and friends both local and abroad and with her own personal resources, started assisting over a hundred families for their childrens hearing requirements. She used her free time to attend to this laborious task of letter-writing, depositing money in each ones account and keeping a record of all transactions in addition to attending to her own personal healthcare and preparing for the next days lessons going to bed as late as 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. daily. Her sacrifice was so great that she considered deaf childrens solace as the primary need in her agenda.
In conclusion, let me explain how I first met Sr. Charmaine. It was at the 25th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Association of Parents of Deaf Children. I had received an invitation to attend the meeting and as I was looking out for some help to bring up my own deaf daughter, I decided to attend it. When the time came for election of a President there was a big commotion as every member whose name was proposed for Presidency started withdrawing with excuses of sickness, distance or age. This went on for abut an hour and finally, the Chief Patron, Sr. Charmaine, made order that the Association be dormant for two years. The members were delighted by this suggestion and the uproar subsided. I was vexed by this proposal and immediately got up and said that the Association should be ashamed to step down like that after running for 25 years and made an open request for someone courageous enough to accept the Presidency. The gathering became silent. All of them were astonished at my words as I had the audacity to challenge the Patron. A few seconds later, my name was proposed for the presidency. I got annoyed and upset and got up to say if the seniors of the Association did not want it to continue, neither did I. The moment I got up to speak, a soft hand touched my left shoulder. I turned back to look; It was Sr. Charmaine. Please dont reject this offer, please accept it. I know you have no experience, but I will give you all the support. Please accept the Presidency.
I couldnt say no to the very kind appeal of the Patron. I sat down silently; somebody seconded my name. A unique instance of one being made President of an Association the very first time he attended a meeting. As I went to the chair, I said, I will accept the presidency just for one year and somebody should get ready to replace me the following year. My appeal was answered only after nine years. Yet I am being re-elected from time to time.

Bakeer Markar
Gentleman politician
V.L. Wijemanna swearing in before Bakeer Maker as acting Plantation Industries Minister
I First came to know Bakeer Markar when I joined the Kalutara Bar more than half a century ago. At that time, I professed a political language quite different to his thinking. I spoke to him with a certain amount of trepidation, but he soon put me at ease and chatted with me as if he had met me after an absence of several years. That is one trait in him that can be vividly explained with one Sinhala word  Nihathamanee, roughly translated as very well behaved towards others although justice is not done by the Sinhalese word.
He was our Senior at the Bar and did not fail to constantly advice the juniors when needed or called on him. Those days, we had Courts on Saturdays. He used to come wearing a Sharkskin coloured suit. At the time, there was utter chaos with Poya and pre-Poya being the week ends. There was only one other Member of Parliament, and he kept aloof from the crowds, but not Bakeer. He was very popular with the juniors. Most of them practiced in the Criminal Courts. At that time, the hierarchy of the Bar Association was dominated by Senior Civil Practitioners. Criminal practitioners and the juniors resented the establishment. They decided to challenge the Supramacists. Enter Bakeer as our Savior. He was elected President unopposed. I was his Secretary.
In the year 1972, a new Constitution came into force. There was a ceremony to welcome the Judges. Late Minister Dr. Colvin R. De Silva, at that time, represented the Government. Addresses were delivered by Dr. Colvin R. De Silva, the Judges and the President of the Bar Bakeer Markar. Bakeer spoke in Sinhalese. He spoke of the wisdom and sense of justice in Sri Lankan History and ended with the Budhist stanza Sabba pa passa Akaranan. There was pin drop silence during his delivery and the audience burst into a spontaneous applause as he ended. Everybody present in the hall, including the Juges, were mesmerized by his speech. Later, Dr. Colvin came up to Bakeer and congratulated him on his endeavor. But all was not well among some members of the Bar. In the course of that year, six motions of no confidence were brought against him. We won every one of them.
The period of the long Parliament ended after seven years in 1977. Bakeer was elected with a vast majority. They were the majority of Sinhalese. He served every person in his electorate with equal vigour. The Beruwela Constituency can boast of the greatest number of social castes not found anywhere in Sri Lanka. Soon after the elections, I saw him in an animated conversation with a lawyer MP who had lost very badly.
The conversation lasted for nearly an hour. After that, I approached Bakeer and told him that I had never seen that MP talk to Bakeer during days of glory in nearly seven years. He told me thats true Siri, but I went up to him and sympathized although he never looked at me even during the period.
Bakeer became Deputy Speaker and Later, Speaker of our Parliament and thereafter a minister. Later, He became the the Governor of the Western Province.
He lived in a rented house, meaning he had not amassed wealth. I am happy to state that under the Ceiling on Housing Law, the ownership of the house befell on him. Bakeers Father was from Galle. He had been a practitioner of the unani system of medicine. Bakeer had a large collection of ancient miniature booklets on cures for a myriad of diseases.
But he is not devoid of Wealth. He left behind his children who are capable of standing tall in any situation.
May the turf lie lightly on him. May he attain supreme bliss in accordance with his religious beliefs.
Siri A. Perera
Tribute
Sumana de Silva
Exemplary centenarian
A century, whether it be a cricket match or a break on the billiard table, is an event which calls for publicity, congratulations and celebrations.
I consider it a great honour and privilege, to send this congratulatory message to my very dear sister-in-law, Sumana de Silva, my husbands sister, on her hundredth birthday, which is on the May 8.
Sumana Akka, as we all affectionately call her, was born on May 8, 1917, in Ambalangoda. She was the eldest child of Patuwatha Withana Thomas de Silva. She started schooling at Girls High School, Kandy and later, when her father joined Government service, she joined Southlands College, Galle, where she was a boarder at the Hostel. She joined the Govt. Training College in 1941 when it was situated at Thurstan Road and passed out as an English trained teacher in 1942. After training, she joined Prajapathi Vidyalaya, Ambalangoda and later taught for a short time at Mahabodhi College, Colombo. She devoted 27 years of her teaching career at Ananda College, Colombo. She joined the Ananda College Staff in 1948 and retired in 1975. During her tenure as a teacher, she was sent on a scholarship to the University of Michigan to study the teaching of English as second language.
As a teacher, thousands of students have passed through her hands and Im sure she can still remember each and every one by name, where he was from and his life at College. Many of her students have become leading doctors, lawyers, engineers, administrators, academics, officers of the Armed Services, Police, businessmen, planters and so on.
She always practiced what she preached and left an indelible mark on everyone who came in contact with her. She was a much loved teacher, who rendered almost 35 years in the cause of education. She never sought publicity, but went on in quiet efficiency throughout the years, giving of her best at all times. Generations of young men have surely reaped the benefits of her high ideals and values.
Sumana Akka is very kind-hearted and possesses a sense of fairplay and justice. Simplicity, is the hallmark of her personality. She possesses many admirable qualitiespatience, integrity, amiability and honestyall these are part and parcel of her.
She married Donald de Silva who worked at the Department of Fisheries. Her husband passed away in 1994, just a couple of months before their 50th wedding anniversary. She was the pivot around which her family unit revolved. Her family always came first. She symbolised the quintessential qualities of motherhood. She was an exemplary mother whose devotion and concern for her children extended beyond their childhood years. Her unconditional love and understanding allowed her children to make their own way in life and today, all of them are doing extremely well in life.

Ranjith Fernando
Beloved husband
Three years have gone to the date of May 9, 2017, from the date that my beloved husband Ranjith Meril Fernando had passed away. But we still feel that he is alive with us, always.
Until Ranjith fell ill, he was efficient and committed to his career activities and all other day-to-day activities. His days were well-planned.
He began his day at 5.00 am with yoga exercises. It followed a morning tea with me, always in an enthusiastic manner, discussing planned activities. He had a deep faith in Buddhism and always listened to morning damma chintha.He never forgot to sweep the house prior to getting ready for office. I prepared his lunch as per his wish and he offered his sincere thanks to me while placing it in his office bag, which I admired mostly in our whole life time. Ill never forget how he appreciated me when I was waiting at the gate till he was out of sight.
On the day we got married (October 15,) we obtained blessings from the Sri Dalada Maligawa. We never repeated it on every wedding anniversary throughout the past 49 years of our marriage life. This was Ranjiths great idea which caused much relief and comfort to both of us.
As a Government Servant, Ranjith served in many parts of the country. Some of them were Matale, Haputale, Kotmale, Mawanella, Nuwara Eliya and Naula. He was an active union member who sustained various positions. He was a July striker in 1980 and had to go abroad since he lost his job. But he used to come to Sri Lanka every year and spend a few weeks with us.
We have four children: two daughters and two sons and they take care of us.
We were lucky to have eight grand children as well. They loved Ranjith very much. He had a great relief by listening to their talks and played with them occasionally.
In addition, Ranjith treated his mother and only sister well. As per the Buddhas guidance, this is a great merit which one can gain throughout his lifetime.
Rajith never forgot to arrange a family trip with all family members every year. It gave a pleasant and joyful experience to all of us and improved unity among family members.
Ranjith had many friendslocal and foreign, male and female. All of them loyal and with good qualities. We went to Dambadiwa in 2012. How he prepared for the journey and the way we travelled together with others remains etched in my memory. It was our first journey to Dambadiwa and I never thought that would be the last as well.
Ranjith observed sil with me on every full moon Poya day without fail. We were lucky since we were able to listen to sacred dhamma desana preached by the Buddha and be able to understand the impermanence of this life.
After returning to home, we discussed it. As per the truth of life, figure decays and the name remains. My beloved husband, I wish I would get your kind assistance in my every birth. On the remembrance of your third death anniversary, we will have a dhamma desana on May 13, followed by a sangeeka dana on the following day at our Kottawa residence.
Our two daughters and their husbands, our two sons and their wives, all our granddaughters and grandsons and our sisters and brothers are joining hands with me to offer the merit of your good work and our aspiration for you is to attain Nibbana.
Non-Existence is nature
Nature is non-existence
Your ever-loving wife,
Nalini Jayanthi Fernando, Kottawa
Dawn Gooneratne death anniversary
In memory of my mum in heaven
If roses grew in heaven, Lord,please pick a bunch for me.Place them in my mothers armsand tell her theyre from me.
Tell her that I love her and miss her,and when she turns to smile,place a kiss upon her cheekand hold her for a while.
Because remembering her is easy,I do it everyday,But theres an ache within my heartthat will never go away
We love you Amma,
Dinesh Gooneratne andAnuri Dissanayake

JKH followed suit, accounting for 6.45% of turnover (value of LKR 0.19Bn) while Ceylon Tobacco contributed LKR 0.17Bn to account for 5.97% of the weeks turnover.
Total turnover value amounted to LKR 2.93Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR 6.77Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR 0.73Bn (-45.91% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 1.35Bn.
Market capitalization meanwhile, increased by 0.62% W-o-W (or LKR 18.14Bn) to LKR 2,926.91Bn cf. LKR 2,908.77Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Banking, Finance & Insurance Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 20.48% (or LKR 0.60Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by the Central Finance & Commercial Bank which accounted for 35.60% of the sectors total turnover.
The Manufacturing Sector meanwhile accounted for 17.46% (or LKR 0.51Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by Tokyo Cement[V] and Tokyo Cement[NV] which accounted for 37.92% of the sector turnover.
The Power & Energy Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 16.06% (or LKR 0.47Bn) to the market. The Panasian Power which accounted for 94.06% of the sector turnover.
Liquidity (in volume terms)
The Power & Energy Sector dominated the market in terms of share volume, accounting for 54.76% (or 140.09Mn shares) of total volume, with a value contribution of LKR 0.47Bn.

Point of view
The market rally which started in late-March continued its uptrend this week too, with the Bourse edging up to a near 1-year high to close at 6640.57 points on Friday.
Active buying interest in the Banking, Finance & Insurance, Manufacturing & Power & Energy counters helped the main index gain ~30 points W-o-W despite some profit taking early in the week. The benchmark price indexs 6 consecutive weeks of gains have added a cumulative~644 points to the index, and has helped the Index gain 6.6% Y-T-D (cf. 4.6% loss for the same period last year) while helping wipe off earlier losses on the Index.
Although lower than last weeks contribution of 41%, crossings over the week accounted for ~30% of market turnover, with Pan Asia Power contributing to 45% of the weeks total crossings.
Comparatively lower HNI participation this week therefore led the average turnover levels falling 46% W-o-W to end at LKR 0.73Bn (~19% lower than the years average turnover levels of LKR 0.90Bn).
Net Foreign inflows however, continued to be in the green for the 14th consecutive week (although average net inflows declined by ~90% W-o-W) bringing the total net inflows for the year to ~16Bn.
Similar market momentum is likely in the week ahead and could to be influenced by the direction of Mar17 corporate earnings.
Jan trade deficit widens as oil imports grow
The trade deficit in January 2017 widened to $934Mn (cf. $691Mn Jan16) driven by a 13.2% Y-o-Y increase in Import expenses as oil imports rose 101.6% Y-o-Y.
Oil imports rose over the month both due to increased volumes needed for thermal power generation (due to the drought) and increasing global oil prices.
Export earnings meanwhile declined 3.8% Y-o-Y amid slower demand for textiles and garments (49% of total export earnings) in both traditional and non-traditional markets. Continued momentum in tourist receipts (12.9% Y-o-Y to $376.3Mn) however, helped offset slower Worker remittances and net portfolio outflows (from equities and debt) over January.
The IMF meanwhile, announced that it would undertake the 2nd review under the EFF program in June 2017 as the new Inland Revenue Act is expected to be submitted to Parliament as a prior action by then.
The IMF added that the CBSLs efforts to accumulate net international reserves as a corrective action for missing the end-2016 target is commendable and that this reserve accumulation should help reduce Sri Lankas external vulnerability.
The IMF also added that progress was being made in the countrys economic reform program particularly in improving the fiscal position, and that the new inland revenue act should enable durable fiscal consolidation that is based on revenue mobilization.

Battling climate change
Its a simple fact that as we continue to pump record levels of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere we are ramping up disaster risk around the globe now and for generations to come.
It goes with the sobering reality of warming and rising seas and widespread changes in the Earths systems that are influencing storms, winds and rainfall.
The toll this takes on human life, economies and government expenditures will be high on the agenda when world leaders gather in Mexico for the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction in late May.
Latest figures show that disasters  90% of which are classed as climate related  now cost the world economy US$520 billion per year and push 26 million people into poverty every year.
In the 22 years that have passed since COP1, the first UN conference on climate change, we have seen greenhouse gas emissions reach critically high levels which bodes ill for those who already live in dry lands, on cyclone-exposed coastlines, flood plains, below unstable hillsides or in parts of the world dependent on glacier meltwater.
State of national emergency
Over that time span we have also seen a doubling of weather and climate related disasters, which can further weaken least developed countries like Haiti which lost over 600 lives and around a third of its GDP when it was struck by Hurricane Matthew last October.
By some recent estimates the bill for Haitis recovery from that Category 4 hurricane comes to US$2.8 billion, an extraordinary sum for a country where 60% of the population live in dire poverty.
The Philippines lost thousands of its citizens partly due to the slow passage of Typhoon Haiyan across the warming, rising waters of the Pacific Ocean in 2013. And again, the economic losses and the cost of building back better ran into billions.
Meanwhile the dry lands of the Sahel and southern Africa already at high risk from rising temperatures, breached the limits of their capacity to sustain human life adequately in the last twelve months as country after country declared a state of national emergency and millions suffered the devastation of hunger and the loss of their livelihoods.
Just five years after the first famine of the 21st century was declared over, Somalia is again on the brink underlining the fact that 80% of the worlds hungry live in countries which are heavily prone to hydro-meteorological disasters.
Climate change, aggravated by phenomena like El Nio, is not the only driver of disaster risk but it is the joker in the pack as the world tries to understand how it combines with other key risk factors such as poor risk governance, rapid and unplanned urbanisation, poverty and environmental degradation.
Much of this understanding and better planning needs to be done now and at the local level. Adopting the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction two years ago, UN Member States agreed to substantially increase the number of national and local disaster risk reduction strategies in place by 2020.
These strategies will be the bedrock for decreasing disaster losses by 2030 through reducing mortality, economic losses and damage to critical infrastructure.
Sustainable Development Goals
It is imperative that we break down any silos that exist between the exponents of disaster risk reduction whose remit extends beyond climate-related hazards, and those whose focus is on climate action.
As these national and local plans are put in place there is an opportunity to ensure joined up action across the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda including the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and an obligation also to avoid duplication of effort.
The achievement of many of the Sustainable Development Goals including those related to poverty, hunger, climate action, sanitation and clean water depend on this.
Both of us recognise that reducing greenhouse gas emissions and keeping global temperature well below 2 degrees C is the greatest long-term contribution that governments, local governments and the private sector can make to disaster risk reduction.
Meanwhile local planning for improved disaster risk management helps create a grass-roots, societal demand for action and ever rising ambition nationally and globally for climate action above and beyond existing pledges.
The outcome of this fifth Global Platform has the potential to bring the worlds of disaster risk and climate risk closer together and that can only be a good thing for resilience; people everywhere and the future stability of our world.
While it is the poor and the vulnerable who are in the firing line now, no country or continent will be immune if we dont take responsibility and seize the opportunity to act today.
Robert Glasser is the UN Secretary-Generals Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction and Patricia Espinosa is the executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Off beat artistic coffee mugs
These gorgeous coffee mugs mimic the natural beauty of crystals and metals. They look just as much like sculptures as they do mugs. Want to feel fancy in the mornings Drinking your coffee from one of these should be all you need.
Self-taught sculptor Katie Marks has been handcrafting coffee mugs which instead of dangling over your kitchen sink, could easily be placed in the middle of an art gallery.
Inspired by the world around her, Katie crafts these exquisite mugs layer by layer, either glazing breathtaking galaxies on them, or hand forming delicate crystals on the sides. I love the fact that I can take a lump of dirt and turn it into something unique and beautiful from my brain, Marks said.
She started her sculpting career after finding a pottery wheel on Craigslist, which she worked without any formal training. This led her to a production potter, where she got a job as a studio assistant and learned everything from glaze chemistry to kiln firing.
But if you want to take your morning coffee out of one of Katies works, youre gonna have to be quick. Because the forever growing fanbase of her ceramics at her Silver Lining Ceramics Etsy shop is prone to snatch any new creation of hers in mere minutes.

Best urban gardening ideas
In an increasing speed of life and the scarce space availability is pushing enthusiasts to create new green eco ideas. Urban gardening is a concept that suggests the idea of planting into the wild, chaotic metropolitan world. There are different types of urban gardening, introducing green solutions in big cities. The concept of urban gardening dates back to ancient times, features the most famous design, The Hanging Gardens of Babylon.
Vertical gardening, or green walls
Vertical gardening is an idea that features including the greenery into walls of the skyscrapers, or other vertical surfaces. It has been known since 1950, but is coming to popularity just now. This concept has many pluses, which can be exploited in daily life, such as clean air, crop production, and future investments, as future is predicted to be mostly urban. The most famous vertical gardening designs are Patrick Blanc green walls. The idea occurred to him, while he was in India and inspired he now creates greenery just on the walls of the buildings.
Another famous to be vertical gardening design can be soon seen in New York, USA. Its ambitious name is Dragonfly farm. The design of this construction was introduced by Vincent Callebaut Architectures. It would serve the agricultural purpose of food growing, and should help in food shortage for city dwellers. Almost 600 meters high, this prominent skyscraper will definitely reshape the landscape of New York city.
Eco-roofs
A good substitute for a garden, is a garden on the roof! The plants are contained in pots, but it doesn't diminish its functions. Of course not every roof will carry the thick forestry, but most roofs are ok to begin with easy plantings or even just grass. The roof gardening serves many purposes, ecological, like heat reduction, and human alike, like greenery enjoyment. Nowadays, the builders are using solar thermal collectors roofs for better effect on the roof gardening. The most known eco-roofs are to be found in Chicago, Millennium Park.
Few people know that it is actually a roof of a large underground garage and train station. It features 24.5 acres of green parkland.
Another famous eco-roof are Ford River rouge factory complex in Michigan, the treasury building in Athens, Greece and Australian parliament Center.

BOI holds seminar for tour guides
The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka organised a briefing seminar for members of the tour guide profession at the BOIs World Trade Centre auditorium,Colombo.
Tour guides both from Sri Lanka and overseas representing all leading tour and travel companies in the country were present.
The rational for this programme is that tour guides are often among the first people to meet foreign visitors to the island and having this initial contact with potential investors, they should be able to advice and guide them in the event of interest on their part. The event was coordinated by Senior Deputy Director (Promotion) and China Desk Officer Vipula Jayasinghe.
The keynote address was done by INTGL Sri Lanka President Indika Vithana, who said tour guides are often excellent ambassadors for their country since they often speak different languages and have regular contacts with foreign visitors who may be potential investors. The programme also included an address by the Assistant Registrar of Companies L. K. S. Dharmakeerthi and lectures on Sri Lankas hub operations; on the BOIs functions; and types of investments that can be made; and on BOIs One Stop Shop and opportunities to investment.
The programme is an effort of the part of the BOI to strengthen ties with other profession who may be in contact with potential investors.

Book review : Ranils Reign
Dinesh Weerakkody recently launched a biography of the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe among a distinguished gathering. Keynote speech was delivered by Sashi Tharoor, Indian politician and former Under Secretary General of United Nations. He is the current Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs. Minister Rajitha Senarathne delivered a speech and mentioned the leftist background of PMs father. He said that Wickremesinghe kept his multi-ethnic and multi-religious Royal College heritage right along so that he is more equipped to give a lasting solution to the ethnic problem of the country.
The book is a political biography of a leader who has been engaged in politics for 40 years so that the book eventually deals with the 40 years of political history of the country. After briefly describing Wickremesinghes political history in one chapter, the author described PMs involvement in various important areas of Sri Lankan political history. This was an interesting approach against narrating the events in a chronological order. Another praiseworthy aspect was that the author being a close associate of the PM was never hesitant to criticize the main character of his book where necessary. Therefore the book was never a mere admiration.
Turbulent carrier
Out of the Sri Lankan leaders Ranil has gone through the most turbulent carrier in politics. Greatness was trust upon some of them and the others had to wait longer time till they get the baton. During his long and uninterrupted spell in the Parliament, Ranil had his ups and downs. As Weerakkody pointed out he was given additional and responsible portfolios by President Jayewardene due to his ability and capacity to work. President Premadasa appointed D.B. Wijethunga as Prime Minister and Ranil Wikremesinghe as Leader of the House ahead of Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake, his leadership contestants.
After Wijetunga he lost the leadership to Gamini Dissanayake. Following the assassination of Dissanayake he became the leader of the party and the opposition. He became the Prime Minister for a short spell where the President was from the opposition party. He lost presidential elections twice, once after the assassination attempt by LTTE on the incumbent President and then after the LTTE ordered Tamils not to vote at the election. He faced several challenges to his party leadership and however managed to survive. He had to hand over the opposition nominations to two common candidates, one lost and the other won. In Ranils words, The important thing is never give up and standby what you believe in, JR did that and Premadasa followed Page 148
Ethnic conflict
In 2002, with no end in sight to the ferocious war that was raging, Prime Minister Ranil Wikremesinghe signed the Ceasefire Agreement that brought the war to an end.
The signing of that agreement was the act of a statesman who put country before self and the Right to Life above all others.When he said that he would negotiate a ceasefire and an interim administration with the LTTE, he stuck to this platform although defeat after defeat followed him. Page 150
It is seldom that ethnic and religious minorities can determine governments. But despite losing ethnic majority support, and losing elections as a result, Ranil Wikremesinghe stayed steady to his course. Page 148
This was an attribute of a selfless leader. A not so close parallel would be Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi conducted his last hunger strike on two demands that Indian Government should pay 350 million to the Pakistan Government and the Hindu refugees who came from Pakistan should release the properties they forcibly acquired from Indian Muslims. Indian people and the Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru conceded in three days.
In this line PM met his counterpart in President who fought hard to reduce his own powers which is a rare phenomenon in world politics.
Inaction of PM
It may therefore be better if Ranil puts his resources to full use now in fighting corruption and taking the country on the development road. This is what the public and Maithri (The President) want from him. Page 116- emphasis is mine.
In Annexture 1, Weerakkody has given his own article published in Daily FT titled -Ranil must rise to the challenge and deliver before its too late- where he blames that so many people are slowly getting disillusioned with Ranils style of governance.
This is the common consciousness of majority of the people who are used to be under near dictators. There are two issues in hand, one is the political reforms and the other is the economic reforms. Under political reforms we need to have a new constitution and a mechanism of power sharing.
Previous governments tried both these without the support of the opposition or opposition deliberately did not support since they have put their own objectives ahead of the national objectives. However ours is a democracy and not a government like of Lee Kuan Yew. Therefore we need consensus of all the intellects, idiots and foxes. Presently we are passing that lull period. When Gandhi stared the hunger strike peoples understood the justice in three days. Our people need much more time. Sub Committee of Centre-Periphery Relationships of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly published its report where Chief Ministers of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party recommended that the powers of the Governors should be curtailed drastically which needs a referendum although SLFP officially rejected a referendum. Several members of the Joint Opposition actively participated at these sub committees. Debate is going on.
Ranil does not want to take this to the people and get ownership of it but he facilitates the exercise. This is everybodys baby. If no one is wearing that hat civil society should do so. The country needs all the corrupt and uncorrupt politicians in this process so that the Government is not in a position to pursue anti-corruption campaign at this moment. That is the crux of it.
In the economic front successive governments maintained deficit budgets for popular reasons. Deficits were supported by loans. In the past we got grants since we were a low income country. Now the situation is different and we get commercial loans instead of grants. As a result of deficit budgeting interest rates and inflation rates have gone up with the arbitrary holding of the exchange rate by the successive governments.
Hence governments facilitated an anti-export policy resulting in balance of payment issues. Previous Government took massive loans and invested in uneconomical projects at least in the short run. Government revenue and export earnings have dropped drastically. Now we are stuck and cannot invest in development projects.
Opening of the economy in 1977 was the first economic revolution. At that time as a country we were stuck. There were lot of opposition for the open economy and some of the businesses which were under state protection went out of the scene. Successive SLFP governments also followed the same policies. Now we want the second economic revolution. That is free trade agreements. Ranil plans to extend the existing one with India, to have new agreements with China and with Singapore. Ranil launched a plan to reform state-owned enterprises, enter into trade agreements with India and China, to increase market access and restructure the key investment promotion agency to become even more appealing to foreign investors. Page 183
As happened in 1977 some of the businesses will have to be closed. Our businessmen should take up that offensive challenge to take on the markets of those big countries. Or else foreign investors should come to take those opportunities. Majority of the country including the businessmen and professionals are in the defensive mode. They may be thinking that it is wiser to safeguard present pennies rather than going for future pounds.
Politicians like to keep the loss-making government institutions, to exercise their power and to appoint their henchmen to the vacancies (or otherwise) in reciprocal favours. They make propaganda that selling those institutes is a loss to the country. In fact, the loss is to maintain those institutes with tax payers money. People do not understand this and vote against selling those assets affiliated with false sense of nationalism. So the hard pills have to be taken just for survival. It might take some time to get the mind sets changed since we are a democracy.
I suppose those are the reasons of visible inaction of the PM who was very active in 2001.
Social Market Economy
Social Market Economy combines free market economic policies and characteristics of a welfare state. This was initially introduced in Germany in 1949 by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. Ironically Ranil addressing a World Bank sponsored summit which was held in the Colombo suburbs (early 2016) said that his Government wants to consciously reduce indirect taxation. The Premier said that currently 80% of tax revenue comprised indirect taxes, while only 20% came from direct taxes. He said that this was wrong, considering the fact that 80% of the countrys wealth was held by 20% of the population. Ranil further said that we want to reduce indirect taxation to 60%, while at the same time enhancing direct taxed to 40%, comparable to global standards. Page 128
Figures of India or Singapore are very much closer to the standard the PM mentioned. PMs vision appears to be that to take the country from crony capitalism sponsored by successive governments to social market economy.
Personal attributes
His tendency to gather around him his close friends of years gone by, who have done very little to help him when he was in the political wilderness, but flock around him when he is in power, has been one of his outstanding weaknesses, which has drawn justified criticism from many quarters page 181
In the Preface Weerakkody said Ranil is surprisingly a very simple man who never throws his weight around. He is only interested in getting a job done well. His seeming reluctance to mix freely with friends, and more so with the common man, made it difficult even for those who admired him, and wanted to enthusiastically support him. This flowed more than an innate shyness than from a seemingly feeling of superiority, but the result was the same. Page 180
Recently when Meethotamulla garbage dump was collapsed, PM was in Japan. He cut short his next visit to Vietnam and rushed back. Thereafter he has visited the site although several other members of the Government did not visit the place and those who were visited were booted by the people. However he was with a facemask where all the people accompanied him were without facemasks. This is Ranil and I think the people of this country should learn how to live with this character for the benefit of them, their children and their country.

Here is a thing that happens to me regularly: I am at work and a man will grab my arm. Usually they do this in a way that is meant to come across as non-threatening. They arent trying to scare metheyre good guys after all. Theyre just curious about me. They just want to know me. They are being polite. They are being inquisitive. They are not breaking any rules.
Usually I will be handing them their change and as I do so, as I carry out this transaction, they will notice the text I have tattooed on my forearm and they will grab my arm to read it, and just like that my body has become a part of this transaction. And perhaps what is worseI dont pull my arm away. I dutifully let them grab my body. I let myself be read. I resign myself to another moment of my body no longer belonging to me.
After they have released my arm they want to know the story. They want to know the why of my body. They want to know the why of this act of permanence. They are entitled to it. And I am expected to explain myself. Because underneath their curiosity, their small talk, their good intentions, they are really asking, Why would you do this to yourself Or perhaps the real question they are asking, the real assumption is, Why would you do this to yourself if you didnt want men to notice
And perhaps Im overreacting. A strange man grabbing you is low on the list of terrible things that men inflict upon women. I should probably just let it go. I should probably accept that I am an upper middle-class white woman living in a coastal city working in a bookstore. I am privileged. I am so privileged. So I should probably just shut the fuck up. And Ive thought about it. Here are the words that have gone through my head every time Ive sat down to write this essay:
I feel guilty writing this. I feel guilty about complaining. I feel guilty about saying these words. I feel guilty about being bothered by this.
And so I stand behind a counter and I hand a man his change and I let him grab my arm and I say nothing. I let him say something that is generally dumb/boring/innocuous. I force myself to laugh at his bad joke. And he lets go of my arm and he goes about his day and I am left no worse for wear other than once again being filled with these familiar feelingsanger, frustration, annoyance, guilt. I am left once again feeling so fucking tired.
Here is another thing that happens to me regularly: I am talking to another woman and there comes a moment of Yes, I know exactly what you mean. Probably we are drinking. Probably we are talking about the men or women we are dating. Probably we are comparing notes, trading break-up stories, trying to one up each otherhe broke up with me over text message but she broke up with me on election night. Probably we are talking about the weirdness of it alllife, etc.
Eventually though it will reach a point with this womanperhaps she is an old friend or maybe we just metwhen the conversation turns to this idea of womens bodies. Thats not quite how it comes up. No one will say, What are your feelings about the female body Usually it will go more like this:
We were walking in the Castro last night and a strange man came up and grabbed my crotch.
I was on the subway this morning and a strange man asked me to give him a hug.
I was at work last night and a strange man came behind the counter and grabbed me.
I was walking down the street yesterday and a strange man yelled, Give me your pussy.
And in a circular way what we are saying is here was another moment when a man imposed himself on me. Here is another moment when a strange man made me feel out of control, unsafe, dirty, used, bad.
Usually they are this: stories of invasion. Its hardly a new ideathat womens bodies are commodities. But stillthere is always a certain level of surprise.

CERN to assist Sri Lanka to develop Physics teaching, scientific collaboration
A steering committee will be established in Sri Lanka to develop physics education at the high school and university levels and to strengthen cooperation with the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said.
The Committee would comprise a core group drawn from universities and relevant agencies, such as the Science, Technology and Research Ministry, COSTI, and NSF.
The Minister was addressing an event on May 3 in Geneva to mark the visit to the CERN by the first scientific delegation from Sri Lanka comprising five Sri Lankan physicists representing universities of Sri Lanka from May 3-5. Sri Lankan Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva and Consul General to Switzerland Ravinatha Aryasinha and officials of the Mission who initiated the process were associated in the event.
The Minister said a road-map will be evolved as a follow up to the visit to enhance scientific collaboration in High Energy Physics between the scientific community of Sri Lanka and CERN.
It will enable Sri Lankan scientists to join the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment and other processes at CERN and thereby to be exposed to cutting edge technology and research in high energy physics. A delegation from CERN will also visit Sri Lanka later in the year to promote the education of Particle Physics in general, among high school students and teachers, undergraduates and scientists.
Welcoming the Minister and the Sri Lankan delegation to CERN, Director of International Relations of CERN Charlotte Warakaulle recalled the excellent relations between Sri Lanka and CERN, and particularly the intensity with which Sri Lanka had engaged with CERN over the past year. She commended the efforts of the Minister in nurturing the young scientists of Sri Lanka, and assured CERNs continued support to developing scientific education in Sri Lanka at the High School and University levels.Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha said cooperation between Sri Lanka and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) was formally initiated in June 2015, following the signing of an Expression of Interest (EOI) Agreement between then Director General of CERN, Prof. Rolf-Dieter Heuer and himself.
It enabled two Sri Lankan undergraduate students to join the CERN Summer Student Programme in June 2016, and also for Sri Lankan teachers to apply to participate in the CERN High School Physics Teachers Programme.
Dr. Rdiger Voss, Senior Advisor of CERN was a special invitee of the Government at the Science and Technology for Society Forum (STS Forum) held in September 2016 in Colombo.
Relations between Sri Lanka and CERN was upgraded when in February 2017, Minister Premajayantha signed the International Cooperation Agreement concerning Scientific and Technical Cooperation in High Energy Physics with CERN Director for International Relations Charlotte Lindberg Warakaulle, and Sri Lanka became the 47th country to sign an ICA with CERN.
At the time, Minister Premajayantha pledged to send a delegation of physicists to CERN to familiarise themselves with the research work underway and to scope out how the two scientific communities could collaborate effectively.
He noted that this year, from among 943 global applicants, which included 25 from Sri Lanka, CERN selected four undergraduates who will participate in the 2017 Summer Student Programme next month. As the Chair of the Group of Fifteen (G-15), Sri Lanka has also signed an Expression of Interest between CERN and the G-15 which actively seeks opportunities of cooperation, and under which CERN has agreed to host 40 teachers from G- 15 countries this year to participate in a CERN Teacher Programme.
The visiting Sri Lankan Physicists delegation included Prof. W.G.D. Dharmarathne, Senior Professor in Physics, Dean of the Faculty of Technology, University of Ruhuna; Prof. Upul J. Sonnandara, Senior Professor in Physics, University of Colombo; Prof. P. Ravirajan, Professor in Physics, University of Jaffna; Prof. S. Rexy Densil Rosa, Professor in Physics, University of Colombo; Dr. M. L. C. Attygalle, Senior Lecturer, Department of Physics, University of Sri Jayawardenepura. Counsellor Shashika Somaratne and Second Secretary Dilini Gunasekera of the Sri Lanka Permanent Mission were also associated in the sessions. During their stay in Geneva, the Sri Lankan physicists familiarised themselves with the several facilities in CERN, including the CERN Data Centre, the Antiproton Decelerator, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) Lab and the SCool lab for High School students.
The physicists also held extensive discussions with the spokesperson team and project managers of the CMS facility on future collaboration between the universities in Sri Lanka and the CMS experiments.
The delegation visited the Synchrocyclotron and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) superconducting magnet test hall and the Microcosm and Globe exhibitions.
The programme concluded with a discussion on follow-up action with the participation of the physicists, the officials from Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka led by Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha and the CERN officials led by Prof. Emmanuel Tsesmelis, the Head of Relations with Associate Members and Non-Member States of CERN.
Joel Butler, Spokesperson of CMS; Dr. Archana Sharma, Senior Particle Physicist CMS; Dr Ana Godinho, Head, Education, Communication and Outreach Group, and Dr Sasha Schmeling, Section Leader, Teacher and Student Programmes were associated in the discussions.

CID called in to probe social media scare
The Health Ministry has made a formal complaint to the CID (Cyber Crimes Section) in connection with some social media reports which spread inaccurate and fabricated health information, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the ministry lodged a formal complaint to the CID on May 6 (last Saturday) in connection with certain information circulated through social media which states that health officers visit homes at night to infected people with HIV in the guise of carrying out blood tests.
The Filaria Control Programme of the Health Ministry had made the complaint to the CID on the instructions of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne. Although the WHO has confirmed that Sri Lanka has minimized Filaria, health officials visit homes at night with numerous difficulties in order to take blood samples from the public to make sure that Filaria does not affect the Sri Lankan people in the long term, he said.
The blood samples are required to be obtained at night because the Filaria worm appears in blood only at night.
The health officials visit homes in their official uniform with identity cards. The Health Ministry requests the public to enable them to obtain blood without any fear after checking their uniform and the identity card, he added.

Private Medical faculties, a dire need
The doctor population ratio in Britain (Developed country) is 1 - 20 in Sri Lanka (under developed country) it is 1-1,000. We have around 20,000 doctors to over 20 million population. The WHO insists that this must be reduced by half to 1-500. This means we require 20,000 more doctors immediately. How can we produce them There are 8 State faculties producing around 1,300 doctors per year. In addition, around 300 foreign graduates join the service yearly. Thus around 1,600 doctors are added to the cadre each year. The population in the country is increasing by around 300,000 per year. Which means we require an additional 600 doctors yearly for the increase in population. The state is hoping to start two more faculties which means there will be 10 faculties. It is obvious that the state cannot provide enough doctors for the country even after 50 years. Thus the only hope is to have Private Medical Colleges on a Private Public Partnership basis, throughout many cities of the country.
In Sri Lanka only 20 percent of those who qualify in the A/L enter the universities. So 80 percent are left out. Fortunately in most of the other professions like Law, Accountancy, Engineering, IT, HR, Management etc, there are enough openings in the country for the students who don't enter the State faculties to get their training and degrees. In my opinion this is the only country in the world where no Private Medical Colleges are allowed to be established by the GMOA and Medical Students.
To produce 20,000 more doctors the 10 State faculties will have to produce at least 2,000 doctors per years. The state will have to put up more buildings to accommodate this number. We will require a minimum of 10 Private Medical Colleges immediately producing another 2,000 doctors. If we do this in five years time we can produce 20,000 doctors. To meet 21st century's challenges in Medical Education, this country will require both State and Private Sector participation, if we are to make Sri Lanka a developed country.
Real free Education must include freedom of Education!

In reference to our news report on the launch of a book Lalith Athulathmudali Assassination published on May 5, Dayantha Athulathmudali, brother of late Lalith Athulathmudali has sent us the following clarification.
I wish to bring to your notice about an incorrect choice of words in the last paragraph of an article that appeared in todays Daily News. In the last paragraph, your reporter says:
Dayanthe Athulathmudali, Laliths brother, delivering a speech lambasted the government for failing to reach a proper verdict in the case.
I have attached the very text I used as the last speaker on that occasion at the OPA.
You will notice that I have NOT lambasted the Govt. nor have I expected the Govt. to reach a verdict. What should have been correct for your reporter to have stated was that I blamed the Police and the Attorney Generals Departments. for taking No action after the Presidential Commission submitted its report. I lamented that this state of continued disinterest by these two Departments has led to Laliths murder remaining unsolved to date.
I expect that you will inform your readers of what should have been printed.

Constitutional Reforms debate likely end June
A debate on Constitutional reforms by the Constitutional Assembly is likely to take place towards the end of June.
The interim report of the Steering Committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be placed before the Assembly next month, a member of the Steering Committee told the Daily News yesterday.
A copy of the same would be handed over to President Maithripala Sirisena. The interim report, which deals with the vital aspects of Constitutional reforms including the electoral reforms, devolution of power and nature of the State, spells out the contours of the Constitutional Bill. A member of the Steering Committee said a draft interim report prepared by the Constitutional Assembly Secretariat was circulated among the Committee members last week.
The draft report is given in all three languages. All members of the Steering Committee have been asked to make their comments, if any, on the report in writing on or before May 23, he said.
The Steering Committee is to sit consecutively from May 23-26 to consider the responses of the members and finalize the report. Through compromise and negotiation, we will try to reach a consensus during these meetings. Where there is no consensus, the members will be allowed to mention their own positions in the report. Likewise, the dissenting views will also be accommodated, he explained.
However, it is learnt that this is the third draft interim report presented to the Steering Committee. The Committee members were unable to reach an agreement on the two previous drafts. The latest draft has taken into account all the deliberations up to last Tuesdays meeting, the Steering Committee sources said.
Sources said the President has regularly been kept informed of all developments at the Steering Committee.
When contacted Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena, one of the two members who represent the JO in the Steering Committee spoke in very negative terms on the Constitutional drafting process stating it seriously lacks transparency.
The JO flatly rejected the two previously submitted draft interim reports. We have been making our contribution actively at the Steering Committee. However, the government wants to do everything in secrecy keeping the others in the dark. We do not have secrets when it comes to matters that affect the country and national security, he commented.
The reports of six sub-committees on Fundamental Rights, Judiciary, Finance, Public Service, Law and Order, Centre-Periphery were presented to the Constitutional Assembly by the Prime Minister on November 19. A three-day debate on Constitutional reforms initially scheduled for January 9 was postponed indefinitely as there was no consensus among the political parties.
The Steering Committee has so far conducted over 50 meetings and according to the sources, a broad agreement over vital aspects such as electoral reforms and devolution of power have been reached after lengthy discussions.

Enter the exercise pill
For those, who cannot undergo fitness training, exercise pill may work as magic for them! A study says, the prospect of an exercise pill can be life-changing for people, who dont work out because of obesity or serious physical disabilities.
Hopes for such a pill emerged from scientists who found that an experimental drug allowed mice to run on a treadmill for 270 minutes before exhaustion set in. Mice that went without the drug lasted only 160 minutes before reaching their physical limit.
Scientists found that the endurance boost was accompanied by other apparent health benefits, leading mice who had the drug for eight weeks to put on less weight and better control their blood sugar levels, suggesting a pill might also help people with diabetes.
Scientists led by Ronald Evans at the Salk Institute in San Diego made the discovery after they set out to explore what endurance meant on the molecular level.If we really understand the science, can we replace training with a drug he said.
They turned to a drug known as GW501516 which had previously been shown to improve stamina and burn fat faster. Through a series of tests with mice on treadmills, Evans found that the drug changed the activity of nearly 1000 genes. Many of the genes that became more active were involved in the breakdown and burning of fat. But other genes were suppressed, including some that convert sugar into energy.
The scientists describe how the findings might explain why runners, cyclists and others athletes can hit the wall when they push themselves hard. The drug makes the body burn fat faster, but also burn sugar more slowly. The upshot is that, on the drug, the drop in blood sugar level that is responsible for the feeling of hitting the wall happens much later than normal.
In endurance sport competitions, such as cycling, marathon runs, race walking and cross-country skiing, hitting the wall is a dramatic demonstration of sudden and complete exhaustion, the scientists write. The study was written in the journal Cell Metabolism. ANI

Exciting blood test spots cancer a year early
Doctors have spotted cancer coming back up to a year before normal scans in an "exciting" discovery.
The UK team was able to scour the blood for signs of cancer while it was just a tiny cluster of cells invisible to X-ray or CT scans.
It should allow doctors to hit the tumour earlier and increase the chances of a cure. They also have new ideas for drugs after finding how unstable DNA fuels rampant cancer development.
The research project was on lung cancer, but the processes studied are so fundamental that they should apply across all cancer types.
Lung cancer kills more people than any other type of tumour and the point of the study is to track how it can "evolve" into a killer that spreads through the body.
Blood test
Janet Maitland, 65, from London, is one of the patients taking part in the trial.
In order to test for cancer coming back, doctors need to know what to look for. In the trial, funded by Cancer Research UK, samples were taken from the lung tumour when it was removed during surgery. A team at the Francis Crick Institute, in London, then analysed the tumour's defective DNA to build up a genetic fingerprint of each patient's cancer.
Then blood tests were taken every three months after the surgery to see if tiny traces of cancer DNA re-emerged.
The results, outlined in the journal Nature, showed cancer recurrence could be detected up to a year before any other method available to medicine.
The tumours are thought to have a volume of just 0.3 cubic millimetres when the blood test catches them.
New hope
Dr Christopher Abbosh, from the UCL Cancer Institute, said: "We can identify patients to treat even if they have no clinical signs of disease, and also monitor how well therapies are working. "This represents new hope for combating lung cancer relapse following surgery, which occurs in up to half of all patients." So far, it has been an early warning system for 13 out of 14 patients whose illness recurred, as well as giving others an all-clear.
In theory, it should be easier to kill the cancer while it is still tiny rather than after it has grown and become visible again.
However, this needs testing.
Prof Charles Swanton, from the Francis Crick Institute, told the BBC: "We can now set up clinical trials to ask the fundamental question - if you treat people's disease when there's no evidence of cancer on a CT scan or a chest X-ray can we increase the cure rate
"We hope that by treating the disease when there are very few cells in the body that we'll be able to increase the chance of curing a patient."
Janet Maitland, 65, from London, is one of the patients taking part in the trial."It was my worst nightmare getting lung cancer, and it was like my worse nightmare came true, so I was devastated and terrified," she said.
But she had the cancer removed and now doctors say she has a 75% chance of being cancer-free in five years.
"It's like going from terror to joy, from thinking that I was never going to get better to feeling like a miracle's been acted," she said.
And taking part in a trial that should improve the chances for patients in the future is a huge comfort for her. "I feel very privileged," she added.
Evolution
The blood test is actually the second breakthrough in the massive project to deepen understanding of lung cancer.
A bigger analysis, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed the key factor - genetic instability - that predicted whether the cancer would return. Multiple samples from 100 patients containing 4.5 trillion base pairs of DNA were analysed.
DNA is packaged up into sets of chromosomes containing thousands of genetic instructions. The team at the Francis Crick Institute showed tumours with more "chromosomal chaos" - the ability to readily reshuffle large amounts of their DNA to alter thousands of genetic instructions - were those most likely to come back. Prof Charles Swanton, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: "You've got a system in place where a cancer cell can alter its behaviour very rapidly by gaining or losing whole chromosomes or parts of chromosomes. "It is evolution on steroids."
That allows the tumour to develop resistance to drugs, the ability to hide from the immune system or the skills to move to other tissues in the body.
'Exciting'
The first implication of the research is for drug development - by understanding the key role of chromosomal instability, scientists can find ways to stop it. Prof Swanton told me: "I hope we'll be able to generate new approaches to limit it and bring evolution back from the brink, perhaps reduce the evolutionary capacity of tumours and hopefully stop them adapting.
"It's exciting on multiple levels."
The scientists say they are only scratching the surface of what can be achieved by analysing the DNA of cancers. BBC

Fake Passport Racket: Another Sri Lankan held in India
The Sahar Police on Friday arrested another Sri Lankan national in connection with the forged passport racket case that was busted by the Sahar police in March, arresting a total of eight foreign nationals including four British and four Sri Lankans.
Earlier, four Sri Lankan nationals were held for using forged Indian passports bearing names of four British nationals to travel to the United Kingdom (UK). It was later revealed that the four British nationals were also involved in the racket and had given their identity to the accused.
According to the police, the accused has been identified as Deva Kumaran, who was arrested in Mangalore on Friday by the Mumbai police after the investigation revealed that Kumaran was in touch with the accused arrested earlier in the case.
The police suspect that Kumaran was an agent who would allegedly arrange for forged passports with the help of British citizens to send the Sri Lankan nationals to the UK.
We have arrested him from Mangalore after we found out he had links with those arrested earlier. We are still investigating his exact role but we strongly suspect that he was the mastermind in the racket. The probe has revealed a few more names that we are investigating, said senior police officer, who is privy to the investigation. The police had also slapped charges of human trafficking against the accused.
Kumaran was produced in the local court on Saturday and has been remanded to police custody till May 9, said Baburao Mukhedkar, Senior Police Inspector of the Sahar Police station.
Four Britishers were arrested at Sahar airport on March 15 for allegedly helping four Lankans migrate to the UK by charging Rs 17 Lakh each, using forged passports.The Britishers had also sent two Lankans earlier to the UK. - DNA India

France elects Macron as new president
France's next president is, let's face it, pretty youthful.
In 2010, David Cameron became the youngest UK prime minister since 1812 when he came to office at 43.
Barack Obama was also thought to be quite sprightly when he became US president in 2009 at the age of 47.
But Macron, at just 39, is much younger. Still, he has some competition in Europe.
InBelgium, Prime Minister Charles Michel was 38 when he became PM in 2014. Last year, Juri Ratas becameEstonianPM at 38. InHungary, Viktor Orban was just 35 when he became PM for the first time in 1998, andGreekPrime MInister Alexis Tsipras was 40 when he was first took office in January 2015.
What does Marine Le Pen do now
At the party's campaign headquarters on election night, supporters carried blue-coloured roses, Marine Le Pen's favoured symbol.
The heavily defeated candidateeven dancedto I Love Rock and Roll (incidentally demonstrating that whatever presentational skills she possesses do not immediately transfer to the disco floor).
It may have been a strange way for a beaten presidential hopeful to spend the night, but this party has long term plans. Supporters will save their blue roses for 2022.
The face-off in France's cities
Emmanuel Macron - who defends internationalism, free trade and liberal values - was always expected to perform better in cities than Marine Le Pen.
Results show that in Paris, he won close to 90% of the vote. But he didn't perform better in all cities compared to his nationwide share of 66% - look at the results for the right-leaning French Riviera city of Nice, for example.
The Mediterranean south-east is seen as a stronghold for the National Front.

Futuristic initiatives for reconciliation
A national policy on reconciliation and coexistence submitted by the President as Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation and Minister Mano Ganeshan as Minister of National Coexistence, Dialogue, and Official Languages was approved by Cabinet last week.
It was long overdue. The seeds of which was originated during the period of government led by President Rajapaksa when three sitting MPs and three civic activists combined and drafted which though circulated widely and submitted to the then President remained a draft.
The policy approved now has several salient features.
The preamble refers to the suffering and impact on lives due social and political tension, including conflict that spanned three decades; acknowledges the breakdown of trust, intolerance and prejudice between and within communities; refers to the lack of an acceptable arrangement of shared political authority that has manifested itself in discontent and violence at different periods in the history of the country; identifies the lack of equal access to opportunity ranging from, but not limited to, education, livelihoods, employment and justice as a major cause of discontent in the country; lays out remedies ranging from strengthening civil administration and, return of property and lands to rightful owners; promoting media freedom, generating livelihood opportunities; and protecting the rights and interest of missing and disappeared persons and their relatives; promotes national coexistence by strengthening the Sri Lankan identity; recognizing the diversity and cultural pluralism through policy, law, education and practice towards respecting the rights of persons to language and cultural heritage; the notion of nationhood to foster a stronger sense of togetherness of all Sri Lankans through dialogue, arbitration and activities prevent reoccurrences of marginalization and conflicts; resolves to implement the languages policy and law, extensively throughout the country in the state and private sectors and among the citizenry; pledging to combat impunity and uphold the rule of law; affirms that a process of healing has to take place in a holistic manner both individually for victims of conflict and violence, and collectively at the level of communities and societies that have suffered; recognizes the importance of developing a national narrative of the past that resonates with all communities in Sri Lanka; calls for a whole-of-government effort and a multi-stakeholder process that combines a two-pronged approach, namely preventive through ensuring non-recurrence of past events, and through futuristic initiatives for reconciliation.
OBJECTIVES
* To function as a state policy on reconciliation and coexistence.
* To provide direction to national reconciliation and coexistence by addressing past violence and conflict, and through envisioning of a shared future that fosters national unity and peaceful coexistence among all peoples and communities in the country.
* To provide a guiding framework to all stakeholders working on reconciliation and coexistence in order to achieve coherence in peace and national unity initiatives.
The Government has two years to show results. Aligning laws, practices and institutions will require time. However concurrent steps can be taken which yield swift dividends. These could include:
 A Commissioner for Minorities to Proactively examine the obstacles faced by respective sectors, including but not limited to, female-heads of households, war widows, children and youth, internally displaced communities, families of the missing and disappeared, ex-combatants and soldiers, differently-abled, resettled communities, socially marginalized, and Sri Lankans living overseas and persons of Sri Lankan origin living overseas belonging to all communities, in participating and exercising their rights and define and implement actions to address these obstacles towards coexisting under progressive and equal conditions.
 Fast track affirmative action programs for the marginalized by - ensuring every such person is afforded standards set out in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which form the policy. Practically ensuring all who lost out on education is offered adult education options on concessionary terms, homeless, unemployed/without means to a livelihood, with health afflictions or suffering from Trauma are given speedy special attention NOW.

GMOAs double games
The duplicitous nature of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) was once again exposed when Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake revealed with proof that GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya was all set to offer private channeling services at a leading private hospital in spite of a GMOA-led strike over the SAITM issue. When the news went viral on social media, with a picture of the relevant receipt, the doctor had apparently cancelled his appointments at all private hospitals.
Although this is the first time they have been caught in the act as it were, it is common knowledge that doctors who strike during day time have no qualms about engaging in private practice or channeling consultations in the afternoon. On this occasion, a GMOA spokesman categorically stated that their members would not offer channeling consultations in private hospitals on strike day. It seems that the GMOA President himself has violated this directive. If he wanted to cancel the appointments, he should have informed the booking sites and hospitals the previous day. The fact this has not been done shows there was a willingness to work in a private capacity while the strike was going on.
Only the poor patients who cannot afford to go to private dispensaries or private hospitals suffer when the doctors strike. The rich and even the middle class can patronize private hospitals and the extremely rich can go to Singapore, but no such options are available to poor patients especially in remote areas. They depend on rural Government hospitals to which they sometimes have to walk for several kilometres through jungle treks. How does it feel to be told that doctors are not in, when you have walked a good few miles to obtain treatment for an ailment
A consensus is growing rapidly in society that the Government should take stern action against doctors who hold patients lives to ransom in this manner. It is time that doctors stopped thinking of themselves as demi gods who are above the law. Many people who commented on social media sites expressed the view that the medical profession must be recognized as a category that cannot engage in strikes, given its crucial importance, on much the same lines as the Police and the Armed Forces.
Today, the GMOA-led doctors are used to resorting to strike action at the drop of a hat. They agitated for duty free cars and the Government restored that facility. Next they wanted to enroll their children to leading schools in Colombo, regardless of their station of work. This was shot down by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam. Now they are harping on the SAITM issue, having kept mum when it was started during President Mahinda Rajapaksas tenure.
It is rather ironic that the GMOA members who oppose a private medical institution do not see anything wrong with working at private hospitals. They will have a more credible case if they oppose all private medical institutions, not just SAITM. Since the GMOA fears the lack of quality standards at SAITM, are they 100% satisfied about the facilities in private hospitals Besides, what is the assurance about quality standards of private medical schools in our region, which the GMOA does not oppose Hundreds of Sri Lankan students study at these universities which charge very high fees that drain our foreign exchange reserves.
As President Maithripala Sirisena said at a public meeting recently, the solution suggested by the GMOA and many other trade unions (a government takeover of SAITM) is rather easy, but the long-term implications are far more serious. No investor will want to invest in the educational sector here and possibly even in other sectors if that happens. Indeed, we saw a similar effect with the Expropriation Act passed sometime back. Yes, a solution that balances the interests of everyone  patients, doctors, State university students and SAITM students  is needed to the SAITM issue, but it cannot be an ad-hoc solution that creates even more problems. All stakeholders have to acknowledge that private higher education is here to stay, locally and globally, and a viable solution has to be evolved based on that presumption. Such a solution cannot be rushed.
In the meantime, strikes wont take the GMOA anywhere. By all accounts, Fridays strike seriously affected only the health sector which is the GMOAs home turf. But there was no enthusiasm at all about the SAITM issue in other sectors such as education and transport (both public and private) which had normal services. If the GMOA had an iota of public support at the beginning of their anti-SAITM campaign, that seems to have evaporated now. The expose of the channeling appointment will make it worse.
Government doctors must bear in mind that the people paid for their education. Given that the rich in this country mostly evade income taxes, it is basically the poor who had footed this bill through indirect taxes. Doctors thus have a duty to serve the people, especially the downtrodden who come to Government hospitals. Doctors must not shirk this onerous responsibility.

The aim is to find out what makes a Great Manager great, how an organizations managers stack up against industry peers, what they can learn from peer group companies and how to nurture more great managers leading to the development of a leadership eco system in the organization. Nominees will be assessed for managerial effectiveness on a global research based model known as R-OPTI.
The focus will be on results, execution, people, team, organizations and leadership integrity with the survey and results audited by an esteemed advisory panel and faculty. Organizations and managers can benchmark best practices, receive recommendations for improvement of leadership effectiveness, and identify key competencies of managerial talent.
The awards are conferred by The Great Manager Awards, a global human resource management consulting body committed to improving performance capabilities and business acumen of partner organizations.
The Great Manager Awards programme launch in Sri Lanka is powered by Colombo Leadership Academy and People Business, a premier leadership coaching and executive education facility with top conglomerate clients.
Our focus is on inspiring organizations and more importantly, individuals, to nurture effective leadership skills and to develop a leadership eco system that drives high performance, said Riaz Hassen, Director and CEO of the Colombo Leadership Academy. So its very exciting to partner with the Great Manager Awards to recognize high performers. This will set the ideal benchmark for recognizing individuals with great leadership and management skills, and the companies that have nurtured such individuals.
The awards will be given in two categories. The main category is for Great Managers, which will recognize leaders across industries and organizations. The second will recognize Companies with Great Managers, which will recognize and award companies with great managerial quotient.

This fascinating idea has been brought to reality thanks to Free Spirited Resorts in Canada, as they have wooden rooms suspended from trees in a forested region of Vancouver Island which are straight out of a dream.
The round tree-houses are not only wonderful on the outside, but also have cosy and well crafted interiors that make the experience of hanging between trees even better. The beautiful cabin can house two people and also has a composite toilet and bathroom on ground level.
A stay at the beautiful domes in the middle of nature away from the hectic life in cities costs around Rs 8550 a night.

Hull suffer relegation jitters, Man City move up to third
LONDON, Saturday - Relegated Sunderland threatened to drag Hull City with them through the trap door after a surprise 2-0 victory on Saturday put a huge dent in their opponents survival hopes.
Four consecutive home wins had put Hull's fate firmly in their own hands but, given the chance to pull five points clear of third-from-bottom Swansea City, they suffered an attack of the jitters that could prove fatal.
Second-half goals by Billy Jones and Jermain Defoe earned bottom club Sunderland a first win in 11 games and condemned Hull to a first home defeat under Marco Silva.
Should Swansea beat Everton later on Saturday, Hull would slide back into the bottom three with two games remaining.
Champions Leicester City finally assured their safety with a 3-0 victory at home to Watford, while Stoke City and Bournemouth will be playing top-flight football next season after a 2-2 draw on the south coast.
Stoke ended a 10-hour away goal drought in the 33rd minute when Bournemouth striker Lys Mousset headed the ball into his own goal but another own goal, from Ryan Shawcross late on, denied Stoke victory.
Burnley are not mathematically safe after they also drew 2-2 at home to West Bromwich Albion.
Sam Vokes scored both Burnley goals.
Manchester City were the only top-six club in action on Saturday and took advantage with a 5-0 thrashing of Crystal Palace who themselves are not safe from the drop after a third consecutive defeat left them in 16th spot.
After two consecutive draws, City needed a win to bolster their top-four prospects and delivered a dazzling display of attacking football to move above Liverpool into third spot.
City never looked back after David Silva's 50th goal for the club in the second minute although it was not until the second half that the floodgates opened with Vincent Kompany, Kevin de Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and Nicolas Otamendi all on target.
Victory moved City to 69 points, above Liverpool on goal difference. Fifth-placed Manchester United, who play sixth-placed Arsenal on Sunday, have 65.
Leaders Chelsea host Middlesbrough on Monday needing just six points from their last four games after second-placed Tottenham Hotspur went down 1-0 at West Ham United on Friday.
To score five against this team is very good and it is an important result for the mini-league fight that we are in for places in the top four, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said.

Immense chaos of feeling
I have resolved on an enterprise which has no precedent, begins Rousseaus Confessions, and which, when complete, will have no imitator. He was right about the lack of precedent and wrong about the rest. Rousseaus imitators even imitated the terms of his boast: It is a thing unprecedented in literary history, wrote Wordsworth of the poem on the growth of his own mind, now known as The Prelude, that a man should talk so much about himself. There are no precedents that I am aware of, mused Thomas De Quincey in Confessions of an English Opium Eater, for his particular brand of impassioned prose. There was, said Evan Charteris, the first biographer of Edmund Gosse, no model for Father and Son, no predecessor in literature.
Rousseau did not, of course, invent the literary confession, but he was the first, suggests Alex Zwerdling, to unmoor his memory and set it afloat with no helmsman at the tiller: I will say everything, Rousseau announced, the good, the bad, in sum, everything. How much was everything, and how could everything be contained While St Augustine, Rousseaus precursor, selected his experiences and shaped his journey, Jean-Jacques courted his own chaos  this immense chaos of feeling, as he called it. Rousseaus Confessions is not the expected career narrative, accounting for how the son of a Swiss watchmaker became the presiding spirit of the age. It presents instead a fevered tale of lies, disloyalty, abscondment, petty theft (an apple, ripe asparagus, drawing paper, a theatre ticket), a false accusation that cost a trusting young servant her job (Oh Rousseau, I thought you were a good fellow), and the routine deposit of his illegitimate brats  five in all, each wrenched from the breast of their mother, Thrse Levasseur  to the steps of a foundling hospital.
The generational conflict
Readers search in vain for the insights and humility we now require of autobiographers. I am made unlike anyone I have ever met, proclaims Rousseau, removing himself from any sense of communal identity. He plunged into his life and he plunged into the telling of his life: the further I go into my story, the less order and sequence I can put into it. Onto this formless and never-to-be-finished mass he imposed no shaping structure or narrative arc because he had no interest in, or knowledge of, a narrative self. Rousseau was our first episodic autobiographer. Looking ahead, he explained, always ruins my enjoyment.
So why did this book, described by Zwerdling as incoherent, self-indulgent, self-aggrandising, embarrassing [and] often irrational, exert such power over Wordsworth and De Quincey Why was Rousseaus Confessions so beloved by George Eliot and Emerson, why did Virginia Woolf lament that there was no womans autobiography to compare with this, and why did John Ruskin, according to Charles Eliot Norton, feel that Rousseau, who was unlike anyone, was so like Ruskin himself that he must have transmigrated into his body
The Rise of the Memoir traces, in seven rich and subtle chapters, the influence of Rousseaus Confessions on Gosses Father and Son, Woolfs A Sketch of the Past, George Orwells memoir of prep school bed-wetting, Such, Such Were the Joys, Nabokovs Speak, Memory, Primo Levis If This Is a Man and The Truce (published in America as Survival in Auschwitz and The Reawakening), and Maxine Hong Kingstons Warrior Women and China Men. Zwerdlings catholic selection allows him to move from memoirs that bare the self to those that bear witness; from private exposures to collective experience. Each writer, he argues, transformed the form (memoir is not, Zwerdling insists, a genre) to meet his or her particular ends. And each writer left behind an archival trove which enables Zwerdling to consider his or her editorial decisions, omissions and silences. Gosse, for example, chose not to include in Father and Son an exchange of letters that take us straight to the heart of the generational conflict he sets out to describe, because they also take us more deeply into his adult experiences than he wanted to go. The blending of close reading with contextual analysis is one of the pleasures of Zwerdlings own enterprise.
Leaving untouched
What Rousseau gave his inheritors, Zwerdling suggests, was a determination to catch those aspects of their lives associated with loss, solitude, shame, confusion, and discontinuity. Each of the memoirs discussed here is born of and propelled by loss  of home, of language, or of parents. Rousseau showed how consciousness could triumph over turbulence, how consistency of character  what Gosse called the hard nut of individuality and Orwell the incorruptible inner self  could master the instability of the past. Rousseau placed, again and again, his hard nut of individuality on what Zwerdling calls the borders of the incomprehensible. His Confessions might look like the work of an amateur, but it involved risk and required courage. A memoir, Rousseau proved, was the writers ultimate challenge. He understood, as Woolf put it, that because real life has no crisis, memoirs must equally lack centre and amble on. Under Rousseaus tutelage, childhood became, for Woolf, many bright colours, many distinct sounds; some human beings, caricatures; comic, several violent moments of being . . . and all surrounded by a vast space . . . . Nothing remained stable for long.
Most importantly, perhaps, Rousseau showed that the confessional I must be both exceptional and commonplace. Clarke Blaise puts it like this: To convince you to read my book, I must convince you of my uniqueness, but to resolve the book, I must conclude with a vision of my lowest common humanity. Otherwise I will be a grotesque, someone memorable and unrepeatable. If Rousseau was a grotesque, unlike anyone, then everyone, including Ruskin, was quite like Rousseau.
With the rise of the memoir comes the demise of the personal pronoun (the so-called personal pronouns, noted Barthes in Roland Barthes on Roland Barthes; everything happens here). Because Zwerdling vaults from Rousseau in the first chapter to Edmund Gosse in the second, leaving untouched the turbulent adolescence of autobiography, we cannot trace the shift from the first person of the Confessions to the more diffident pronouns employed by Rousseaus twentieth-century descendants. What we know is that Rousseaus unlike anyone became Primo Levis quite like everyone. Levi, who envied Joseph Conrad the invention of Marlow because he exempted him from the anguish of having to say I, preferred to speak of we and our. Writing collectively gave his memories, Levi hoped, more documentary reality. Gosse, who found I impossible, variously appears as the writer or the son, having introduced himself, in the opening sentence of Father and Son, as one of the two temperaments, two consciences, and almost two epochs whose battle he would here narrate. Orwells journalistic I, Zwerdling notes, is democratic. He wants to record what he has seen without recording himself. Even when confiding his misery at prep school, Orwell shifts to the second person: At eight years old you were suddenly taken out of this warm nest and flung into a world of force and fraud and secrecy, like goldfish into a tank full of pike.
Originally published
The memoirs discussed by Zwerdling were born of ambivalence and fierce resistance. Witness the gestation periods. Such, Such Were the Joys, an essay of 20,000 words, was years in the making and appeared only posthumously; Gosse began Father and Son, which he published anonymously, a full decade after he conceived of the work; Nabokovs Speak, Memory, originally published as a series of essays for the New Yorker, took three decades to reach its final form. The Truce was finished fifteen years after If This Is a Man, whose story it immediately continues; Virginia Woolfs A Sketch of the Past, in which she recalls her brothers sexual abuse, was not printed until two decades after her suicide; and China Men went through at least eight drafts. So why, Zwerdling wonders, do these reluctant confessors condemn themselves to print at all Why make public the perceived shame, guilt, or abjection This is what bothered Thomas Hardy.
I knew, of course from cursory remarks of yours, Hardy wrote to Gosse, having read Father and Son, that you had had some experiences of the sort . . . . I wonder what finally decided your printing them What do memoirs require of their readers The question is at the heart of The Rise of the Memoir.

India worlds biggest two-wheeler market
India has overtaken China to emerge as the worlds biggest market for two-wheelers. A total of 17.7 million two-wheelers were sold here last year, thats over 48,000 units every day.
Neighbouring China trailed with 16.8 million units sold, according to officials from industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) as well as data from China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
Besides rising incomes and growing infrastructure in rural areas, one big reason for the spurt in sales has been women commuters+ who like the ease of zipping in and out of chaotic city traffic on their gearless scooters. For Honda, which leads the scooter market, the share of women is at 35%.
The market in China has been on a decline over the past few years, perhaps due to the fast-paced growth in car sales there as well as the curbs on petrol two-wheelers in top cities.
The Chinese market has been coming down from the highs of 25 million or so, reached a few years back, says Sugato Sen, Deputy DG of Siam.
However, the sales of electric two-wheelers have been on an upswing in China. Indonesia is holding steady as the third-largest two-wheeler market with annual sales estimated at 6 million units. Here too, volumes have slipped from 6.5 million units sold in 2015.
The need for mobility is very large in India, and we are one of the fastest developing economies in the world, says YS Guleria, Senior VP (Sales & Marketing) at Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI). (Times of India)
