Rugby royalty and the art of finishing
Greetings island rugby fans as March closes another gruelling season for the entire brotherhood ...a season that promised many exotic opportunities, and grand possibilities of a new hierarchy of rugby royalty.
Purists and pundits were seen gleefully trotting around the hallowed halls with, armed with new Intel and significant details of teams packing names and skills. The season promised mighty clashes ...huge match ups, tough games that would pummel reputations and change the established order.
Police claimed the best draft with the whos who of national rugby...Bilal tank Hassen, Reza reliable Mubarak, Terence big bear Henry, Achala Samoa Perera, Mohamed Fast feet Sherrif and company ..Havelocks set their sights above the park horizon and more national caps...Sadun Herath, Shenal Dias, Muthutantri, Hirantha Perera, Niroshan Fernando plus Lagga as coach .
CR and Kandy the top end for sure...would the experts get it absolutely right...or will we see a change in the ownership at the top ...basically can Kandy be beaten and will Havies or CR be the possible threat ..Army, Navy and Police...looking the part with impressive pre season conditioning. The question was...who would last the pressure...step up...be fit and match the best in the middle and be consistent all the way through Experts were heating up with predictions and many were highly qualified on FB and such exotic search engines...Google a possible 2nd
You have to admire the level of expertise on social media platforms across the island. I think there is definitely a positive to some of it...but as a rule...its a good read and little left after warm up.
Kandy...Kandy...Kandy...thats all that needs to be said. If you fail to appreciate their consistency and their structure, then you fail to appreciate the core value of team sport a strong head means an able body, a good attitude and skills to match, with a hard work ethic and quality players ..the perfect platform to launch any ambition.
The year 2016 will long be remembered for how Kandy was nearly beaten but survived against CR and Havies, on their off days
If a team can win after 80mins, not playing their best rugby there is a sprinkle of magic in their boots! Looking at the boots...Marija, Nigel Ratwatte, Gayan Weeraratne, Sooriyabanda, Jehan, Roshan Weeraratne, Anthony, Lavanga Perera, Jamaldeen, Vishwamitra J, Kalhara, Williwera ...made those boots very special.
Bench strength put them up in the top drawer...work rate in the middle meant an ability to survive ...and belief in their team, gave them the league and knockout titles in style especially Nigel Ratwattes inspired kicking that really did make the difference.
Champion teams have greatness in the smallest things, and can slide to the finish, despite everything the opposition has piled on them. CR found that out to their astonishment, and some clinical finishing from the 7s flier Srinath Soori...such a pleasure to watch the platinum skills, shared on the biggest platform with a diving try in the corner, to swing the game back.
The rest as they say is history and Ratwatte just pops a corner flag kick to wound CR and complete the double....Lady Clifford would have cheered heartily!
Rugby mentions for Imthie Marikkar - a fabulous run with CR as coach ...the performance level certainly worthy, and a sign of a well planned season.
Sports Today for pictures and inspiring copy throughout. Anushi Bandara for comprehensive pictures from rugby the world over .
Adds perspective and makes the union family stronger.
Gamika de Silva and Udeini Rambukwella...my buddies from many seasons and sheer work for the game irrespective of loyalties.
Ground staff at all the venues for dedication and hardly ever mentioned. Trevor Nugawela at the Racecourse for effort and a smile, even when under pressure. Kanishka at Singer ...always on time and delivery as planned a friend and dedicated follower of the game. All the fans who still get to games and encourage the next generation to dream beyond their horizons.
Sevens coach Matt Turner for backing us islanders and sharing Intel with our mens team. Linda Itunu coach for the womens 7s and a step up to the Hong Kong 7s next month.
The game goes onplayers need to recharge...injuries time to heal and rehabilitate. Ask Lasantha Basnayake how he managed to keep Kandy fighting fit every weekend and still perform despite the niggles ...a good physiotherapist is worth his weight in gold. .thanks bassa for Sri Lanka 7s and the effort for Kandy.
The focus shifts to international rugby...the Asian 5 nations and the 7s ranking tournaments ...national trials list the players who have a shot at stamping their mark with a national cap worthy reward for a hard graft season and the highest honour. Blessings to all who make the grade and well done to all the players for a season and inspiration.
Bula bula island rugby and the warriors who believe in the flag and live their dream.

Kandy Sports Club kings of rugby again
Kandy Sports Club was crowned kings of rugby again when they pushed to the sidelines CR and FC 31-28. The two perennial rivals in local club rugby faced off for one final time for the season at the Race Course for the coveted Clifford Cup.
Both teams were geared up and well prepared for the occasion and they knew that it was an All or Nothing battle. In what turned out to be a mouthwatering clash Kandy SC left it to the final stages to edge out CR and FC and deservedly emerge champs for 2016.
A penalty in the dying moments of the game off the boot of Nigel Ratwatte helped Kandy to win the Clifford Cup for the 20th time in 24 years.
If the first halfs play was an indication then CR and FC showed they had all the chances of pulling the game in their favor, but Kandy had them back pedaling and simply smashed them backwards in the second half mainly in the last 11 minutes. Kandy proved that they knew how to win a Cup final.
This grand final was graced by Sports Minister Desire Jayasekara who was the chief guest. Finance Minister Ravi Karunaratne, Ranjith Page Cargills big boss and Dr. Hans Wijayasuriya from Dialog, the prime sponsors of sport in the country were also present to enjoy the exciting action dished out by the two teams.

I will never leave the SLFP - Nimal

Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday said that he would never leave the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and would die as an SLFP member and not as a UNPer. "I did not receive any invitation from the UNP to join the party. All media reports on this topic are fabricated," Minister de Silva asserted.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday he said that he spent 35 years in the SLFP and SLFP policies are in his blood.
I have no intention whatsoever to leave my party. I joined the Government and now holding this Ministerial post because of the decision taken by the Central Committee of the SLFP.
I will go home and not to the UNP when I leave politics", he emphasized.
Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said that the SLFP segment in the Government is equal to the UNP segment and are are equal partners.
The SLFP is no low cast and the UNP is not high cast. Everything will converge in the middle The SLFP always give priority for what is best for the country.
It is very pathetic to see how some political parties which set fire and destroyed valuable resources in the country are now trying to fish in troubled waters.
President Maithripala Sirisena has given the power of the SLFP to the 'sufferers' now and not to the persons who inherited power in the SLFP. It is now the time of the 'sufferers'.
"We will take the party forward without breaking it. No one or nothing was able to break the SLFP in the past and it will be the same in the future," he added.

Former Presidents should not use SLFP to take revenge - Dilan

Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga should not use the SLFP to take revenge on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Rajapaksa should not use the SLFP to take revenge on President Maithripala Sirisena over personal reasons instead they should promote the SLFP, Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, Perera said former President Bandaranaike knowingly or unknowingly promoted a breakup in the SLFP and she is supporting Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe than the UNPers do. If former President Rajapaksa shared both blames and credits with others, he still holds the presidency. But he and his family members only shared blames with others while keeping credit to themselves.
According to State Minister Perera the SLFP and the joint Opposition are on a pilgrimage to Shripada in two different paths. By 2020, the SLFP and the Joint Opposition will meet each other at Shripada and form a government. No SLFP MP in the Joint Opposition is against the President, the SLFP, etc. Only two persons (from Gampaha and Ratnapura) are against the President and the SLFP. The SLFP will not let Basil Rajapaksa to form a new political party as he tells.
He pointed out that there is no two gangs or groups in the SLFP and there are only two different opinions / ideas. President Sirisena has given permission to represent these two opinions in the Parliament. There were over 40 SLFP committee meetings countrywide but disturbances were reported only from three or four of them. Discussions have already commenced with all the political parties in the UPFA.
"No disciplinary action is required against the SLFP MPs who took part in the Hyde Park rally because they did not criticise the President, the SLFP etc. Disciplinary action will be taken against two SLFP MPs who spoke to the media about forming a new political party. Only one politician in the Sri Lankan political history removed the word 'unitary' from the Sri Lankan Constitution thrice. He did it in 1995, 1997 and in 2007. He is Prof. G. L. Peiris," he said.
"Some ministers still act like MPs in the Opposition and some Opposition MPs act like they are still holding ministerial posts. It is because they used to it. Pathetically it is the same with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
There will be no election for another four and half years. This is the reality. Therefore we have to serve the people without shouting at each other," he added.

He was addressing the media yesterday at the N. M. Perera Centre, Borella.
According to him, the Joint Opposition will file a case in the Supreme Court tomorrow and also hopes to make a request to the PAFFREL to intervene with the issue and take appropriate measures to force the government hold the LG polls.
It is also expected to submit a petition with one million signatures to force the government to hold Local Government Elections, he said.
Prof Peiris also said that there are no legal barriers to postpone the election and added that there is only a political purpose behind the postponement of the election. He claimed that the government knows that it will be defeated if it holds the election on time due to the crisis situation currently experienced by the government.
Commenting on the government's attempt to attract foreign investors, Prof. Peiris said that only the insane will invest with the crisis relating to economy, electricity and basic other requirements which are needed for investments. UPFA Matara District MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardane said the government is the weakest government formed in the recent times in Sri Lanka.
The government has failed to fulfilled the basic needs of the people. People who depend on tea and rubber have to commit suicide since the government has failed to fulfill their requirements, he said. UPFA Gampaha District MP Sisira Jayakody urged the police to arrest the people who were involved in the demolition of walking track in Wattala under the Public Property Act following a proper investigation, since they have damaged public property.

'Govt's reconciliation process severely hampered by Wigneswaran's attitude'
Northern Province Chief Minister P Wigneswaran's behaviour severely affects the reconciliation process initiated by the Government and its people in the South, said Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe.
He stated that Wigneswaran boycotted the recent 32nd Chief Ministers' Summit in Galle as well as all the other previous summits. He said the government or the other chief ministers should explain to the country's people the reason why Wigneswaran boycotted all the summits as invitations were extended by the President.
"Wigneswaran too boycotted Cabinet meetings although the President invited all Chief Ministers to attend them to discuss the development programmes that are to be implemented in those respective provinces," Warnasinghe said. "It seems that Wigneswaran is promoting racism and separatism.
It seems that Wigneswaran does not accept the Lichchavi democracy promoted by the government's Good Governance theme to further discuss and disperse peacefully."
He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the JHU headquarters.
"The Northern Provincial Council has utilized only 20 percent of the allocations made by the Central Government since 2013," Warnasinghe said. The balance had been returned to the Treasury, he said. So they are not using those funds for the benefit of the Tamil people in North. They wish to keep those people in the North deserted with the idea of promoting separatism."
He said although Wigneswaran's Northern Provincial Council wanted more power, they have done nothing for the Tamil people in the North with the funds provided and presently existing powers.
Warnasinghe challenged Northern Chief Minister Wigneswaran to reveal the roads, bridges and other development programmes that they had implemented in the Northern Provincial Council for the benefit of the people.
He also said that the Sinhalese and Muslim people in the North have been deprived of their rights and equal status.
"Those Sinhalese and Tamil people have been deprived of their right to settle down at their selected places, education, language, religion etc," Warnasinghe said.
"The people of Bogaswewa in Vavunia are suffering severely due to this administrative harassment.
In 1984, the people in Nayaru and Kokilai were subjected to ethnic cleansing with weapons and the same is been done today," he said.
He added that all these problems could be discussed at the Chief Minister's Summit or at Cabinet meetings which Wigneshwaran is neglecting.
He said the government had to take stern action to bring Wigneshwaran into these forums or take the responsibility.

Black Caps hit by Cyclone Roy crash to seven-wicket defeat
DELHI: A cyclone by the name of Jason Roy destroyed whatever hopes New Zealand had of reaching a World T20 final when he smashed a brilliant 78 off 44 balls with 11 fours and two sixes to steer England to a seven-wicket win in the first semi-final played at the Feroz Shah Kotla grounds, here on Wednesday.
Roy, who apparently is the Surrey team mate of former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara waded into the New Zealand bowlers from the beginning taking four fours off the first over bowled by Corey Anderson and did not look back since until he was dismissed in the 13th over. By that time the damage was done and England were smelling victory.
Roy who eventually picked up the Man of the Match award had an answer to everything that New Zealand threw at him and made the target of 154 look pretty small as England sped home with 17 balls to spare.
England will meet the winners of the second semi-final between India and West Indies scheduled for Thursday at Mumbai. The final will be played at Eden Gardens Kolkata on April 3.
Roy and Alex Hales gave England a blistering start posting 82 off only 8.2 overs where Hales' share in the partnership was 20 off 19 balls.
New Zealand managed to pull back the scoring rate when left-arm spinner Ish Sodhi sent back Roy for 78 and England captain Eoin Morgan for a first ball duck off successive deliveries.
But the openers had done enough for England not to take any undue risks. Joe Root and Jos Buttler saw them home and into a second final. The previous occasion England reached a World T20 final in 2010, they emerged champions beating Australia in the final.
To New Zealand's dismay Root and Buttler continued from where Roy left off. They attacked the spinners and Sodhi went for 22 in the 17th over when Buttler smashed him for two sixes and two fours. The England wicket-keeper finished the match off in style when he crashed a short delivery from Santner over midwicket for six.
Root was unbeaten on 27 and Buttler on 32 not out.
New Zealand hadn't been in such a deep hole the entire tournament and yesterday was a true test of their character and, they came off second best.
If Roy laid the platform for England's facile victory, it was their bowlers who came back strongly in the second half of the innings to strangle New Zealand and restrict them to a total of 153-8.
No one would have thought that New Zealand would end up with only that much when at the end of the halfway stage they were 89-1 - courtesy a Kane Williamson (32) and Colin Munro (46) 74-run partnership.
But England's attack put on a solid collective effort to drag things back their way. Chris Jordan and Ben Stokes took 5 for 20 from the last four overs to choke New Zealand and leave them in tatters as they managed only 64 off the last 10 losing seven wickets.
A total of 153, New Zealand's bowlers had defended before but not with Roy in the mood he was. He was simply devastating and New Zealand had no answer to his calculated assault.

Australia surges into fourth straight final

DELHI: Australia surged to their fourth straight final of the ICC Women's World T20 when they beat arch rivals England by five runs in a thrilling semi-final played at the Feroz Shah Kotla grounds here on Wednesday.
Chasing Australia's score of 132-7, England threw away a wonderful start of 67 given by openers Charlotte Edwards (31) and Tamsin Beaumont (32) to slump to 117-7 and eventually lose the contest by a narrow margin.
At one stage England needed 45 off 42 balls with nine wickets in hand, but from that point onwards Australia fought back to capture six wickets for 39 runs and put the pressure back on England which they were unable to absorb.
England's running between the wickets was sloppy and Australia's progression to the final was noteworthy.
"There are no secrets between us. Australia held their nerve and that was the difference," said England captain Charlotte Edwards. "We did not start well with the ball, but dragged it back. It was not meant to be for us today."
Australian captain Meg Lanning who took the Player of the Match award with a beautifully constructed half century off 50 balls said, "We were about par at the halfway. We stuck to our guns and if we did that, we knew we would be alright at the end."
Australia, the defending champions will meet the winner of the second semi-final between New Zealand and West Indies. The match is to be played at Mumbai on Thursday.
The final will take place at Eden Gardens on March 3.
Scores:
Australia Women 132-6 in 20 overs (Alyssa Healy 25, Elyse Villani 19, Meg Lanning 55, Natalie Sciver 2/22)
England Women 127-7 in 20 overs (Charlotte Edwards 31, Tamsin Beaumont 32, Sarah Taylor 21, Megan Schutt 2/15)

Clash of the Titans! Kohli v Gayle in T20 semi

BOMBAY, WEDNESDAY: Chris Gayle is determined to grab the World Twenty20 limelight back from in-form Virat Kohli when the West Indies and India clash in a mouthwatering semi-final in Mumbai on Thursday.
The destructive opener smashed an unbeaten century, which included 11 sixes, in the West Indies' opening win against England but has only batted once since, making just four. Kohli has been the star of the tournament so far, expertly guiding India through the group stages with a half-century against Pakistan and 82 not out in a crunch win over Australia. With the flat wicket at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium a dream for batsmen, the last-four showdown between the hosts and 2012 champions is set to be a battle of the big-hitters.
"I am looking to show what Chris Gayle is," Gayle warned ominously on Tuesday.
"I have only batted twice but this (semi-final) is a perfect opportunity to actually start the tournament and try and pick up where I left off, get a big one for the team and put them in a winning position," he added.
The 36-year-old described Kohli, who is the top run-scorer left in the tournament with 184, as a "world beater" but insisted neither he nor the West Indies were concerned about individual players.
"Chris Gayle will always be positive. It does not matter which bowler is bowling against Chris Gayle," he said.
"Chris Gayle would attack. That's the nature of T20 cricket. And that's the nature of Chris Gayle. "No names, just cricket ball, beat it as hard as possible," Gayle added.
Injury worries
India are looking to take another step on their quest to become the first team to win the World T20 twice, after their triumph in the inaugural 2007 edition, and the first on home soil.
They are also bidding to give inspirational 34-year-old captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni -- who is though to be close to announcing his retirement -- the chance to out on a high.
India were stunned by New Zealand in their first match but picked up three straight wins to qualify second from Group Two.
By contrast, the Windies won their opening three games to top Group One before being shocked by minnows Afghanistan.
Gayle believes India have the momentum but warned that "anything was possible".
"India are the favourites. It is always going to be difficult to beat them here. But the West Indies are ready for an upset," he said.
The Windies preparations were dealt a blow with the announcement that Andre Fletcher, whose unbeaten 84 fired his team to victory over Sri Lanka, had been ruled out the rest of the tournament with a hamstring injury. Fletcher has been replaced by Lendl Simmons, who gets a second chance to take part having been originally named in the squad but having to withdraw on the eve of the tournament with a bad back.
India meanwhile are sweating on the fitness of left-handed batsman Yuvraj Singh, who picked up an ankle injury against the Aussies. Ajinkya Rahane and Manish Pandey stand ready to replace him.
"I don't know whether we should make changes but it is possible, depending on the wicket," Dhoni said earlier this week.

Pandey replaces injured Yuvraj
The ICC has confirmed that the Event Technical Committee of the ICC World Twenty20 India 2016 has approved Manish Pandey as a replacement player for Yuvraj Singh in India's squad for the tournament.
Yuvraj twisted his ankle while batting in the previous match against Australia in Mohali and has been ruled out of further participation in the tournament.
The 26-year-old Pandey has played two T20Is, which were against Zimbabwe in Harare in July last year. He has also played four ODIs.
2007 champion India will take on 2012 winner the West Indies in the second semi-final at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Thursday.

Former Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene to play for Somerset in T20 Blast
Somerset has signed former Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene for the majority of the 2016 NatWest T20 Blast campaign.
The 38-year-old, who scored almost 12,000 Test runs, will play in 12 of Somerset's 14 group games from June, and joins fellow star name Chris Gayle at Taunton.
Jayawardene, who retired from Test and T20 international cricket in 2014, said: "Somerset is a really good club with a long history and I hope that I can help bring success to the county.
"The club has a tradition of successful overseas players and I will be doing my best to join that illustrious list."
With Jayawardene and Gayle in their ranks, Somerset can lay claim to the two highest run scorers in ICC World Twenty20 competitions and director of cricket Matthew Maynard hopes that will draw the crowds this summer.
He said: "Mahela is a batsman of undoubted class who scores his runs all around the wicket. When a player of his experience and class becomes available, you have to snap them up. He is an experienced international captain and the squad will certainly benefit from having him around the dressing room.
"He is a true professional and will have a major influence both on and off the field for us during the NatWest T20 Blast campaign. To have the top two run scorers in the history of the ICC World T20 walking out in to the middle at Taunton is something that I hope the members and supporters will be looking forward to."(talksport.com)
