SA names  Invitation XI against Sri Lanka

CAPE TOWN: Omphile Ramela will lead the South African Invitation XI in the three-day tour match against Sri Lanka to be played at Senwes Park in Potchefstroom from December 18 to 20.
A left-hander with the temperament of a scholar Ramela is unusual for a South African cricketer in all the right ways. He is one of a handful of black African batsmen to make their name in the longer format and one of a select group of professional players with a degree behind his name. Ramela, who also speaks five different languages, was studying towards a Masters in Economics while captaining the Cobras.
The match comes two days after the T20 Challenge final and before the Sunfoil Series resumes in January, assuring there is no clash with franchise cricket.
We see this match as a wonderful opportunity to see what some of our younger players, who have shown good form in franchise cricket this season, can do against quality opposition, commented Cricket South Africa (CSA) selection convener Linda Zondi.
This is a good chance for these players to show what they can do at the next level.
We have also included a number of provincial players who stood out in the Africa T20 Cup or for the SA academy team.
It is important that these younger players have some experience to feed off and this will be provided by the likes of Ramela and Dane Piedt.

India hail sweetest win over humiliated England

MUMBAI: Virat Kohli hailed India's series win over England as his "sweetest" as captain on Monday after the hosts humiliated the tourists by an innings and 36 runs in the fourth Test.
Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin tore through England's lacklustre lower order in just half-an-hour in Mumbai as India clinched the five-match series 3-0 with a game to spare and equalled their longest unbeaten run.
England started the final day at the Wankhede Stadium trailing by 49 runs with four wickets remaining, and needing something extraordinary to avoid defeat.
But Ashwin grabbed all four wickets to send England crashing to 195 all out and finish with figures of 6-55 in the innings, and 12 scalps in the match.
Skipper Virat Kohli was named man of the match for his brilliant double century in a win that confirms India as Test cricket's top side and avenges their two consecutive series defeats to England.
"This series win is probably the sweetest we have had in the last 14-15 months," said Kohli, who took over from Mahendra Singh Dhoni as Test captain last year.
India have now won five straight series under Kohli, who struck his third double century of the year, and are unbeaten in 17 Tests, which equals their best-ever run which was set back in 1987.
England captain Alastair Cook paid tribute to Kohli's batting, saying his Indian counterpart had led from the front and was in the form of his life.
"Clearly (he is) one of the greatest batsmen of our generation," said Cook, the highest scorer among current Test players.
Cook, who has hinted he may step down after the series, also admitted it was a mistake to pick only two specialist spinners in Mumbai's spin-friendly conditions.
"We would have liked another spinner but we had the opportunity to bowl India out for 400 and we did not take them," said Cook.
Ashwin first dispatched Jonny Bairstow, who could only add one run to his overnight half-century, before clean-bowling Chris Woakes for nought.
Adil Rashid followed, caught in the deep by Lokesh Rahul for two, off Ashwin's bowling, to put England at 193 with just one wicket remaining.
Emotions then threatened to boil over as Ashwin approached and exchanged words with James Anderson as he came into bat. He walked with him down the crease, forcing the umpire to intervene.
"It was clearly reference to what Jimmy had said yesterday which got blown out of all proportion," said Cook, referring to Anderson's comments that Kohli had some "technical deficiencies" in his game.
"It was a bit of a sour end really, a bit disappointing in terms of how well the spirit between both sides had been," he added.
Kohli, who is known for his feisty demeanour on the field, joked that "for the first time I was trying to calm down things down".
"I was laughing but Ashwin wasn't too impressed so he let him know. He didn't use any bad words, honestly," said the captain. AFP

Alarm Bells from Arjuna: Strike at Hambantota Port has eroded confidence of international maritime sector

Some shipping lines informed they may not use port in future
Protesters are former Nil Balakaya members

The recent incidents at the Hambantota Port have eroded the confidence of the international maritime sector and some shipping lines have informed they may not use the port in the future, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said yesterday.
Speaking to the media in Colombo, he warned that major shipping lines may abandon the Hambantota Port if worker unrest continues.
We are redirecting some of the ships coming to the Hambantota Port to Colombo. We are losing the rest. The damage by the protesters is severe, the minister said.
We are yet to witness and assess the damage to the 13 storeyed building which is under their control. It has been reported that they have flooded the premises, shut down the CCTV system and electricity, he said.
We are not sure whether they have damaged the computer system as well. The crane machines were damaged. Acts of vandalism of this nature cannot be accepted, Ranatunga said.
We have let the law enforcing authorities to take things under their wings, the minister said. It is with great regret that I say that these protesters have become puppets of a political propaganda. It is not a secret that 400 of these protesters were former Nil Balakaya errand boys of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his son Namal, he said.
None of these protesters received permanent jobs during the former regime. They do not possess a single written document regarding their jobs. They were recruited by a company called the Magampura Port Management Company. Their contract was over a year ago. They are in their probationary period, which basically means that all of them have secured permanent jobs. They are misled by a gang belonging to the former regime to carry on the protest they initially started, Ranatunga said.
These politicians do not like these protesters to get a permanent job in fear of losing their loyalty, the minister said.
There are some leading figures in Nil-Balakaya involved in this protest. We already have footage of these figures. If they cannot understand that they are being manipulated, we have nothing to do about it other than let the law enforcement authorities do their job, Minister Ranatunga said.
He said he was adamant to secure the jobs of these workers, when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama started discussions with the Chinese company.
How can I take responsibility of these workers. If the Chinese company asks us are these the kind of people you are going to recruit to the company, we would be speechless. These protesters were not in anyway at a risk of losing their jobs due to the agreement signed between the government and the Chinese company, Minister Ranatunga said.
He also said that he was also against privatisation.
However, there are times we have to take certain steps for the sake of our people and the country. What happens in the Hambantota port agreement is not privatisation. We are trying to minimise the debt which was caused by the former regime. What would happen if the Chinese company gives up on the Hambantota port. Who is going to pay the debts Namal Rajapaksa says it cost Rs. 400 million where as the actual expenditure is Rs. 1,300 million. Where has the rest of the money gone Mahinda Rajapaksa will not pay the debts on behalf of the government. We have come into this joint agreement to dodge the amount of debts that may crash upon our economy. We are already spending the profit we get from the Colombo port to pay the debts of Hambantota port. We cannot allow this to continue, Minister Ranatunga said.
Responding to a question regarding the agreement on Hambantota port, Minister Ranatunga said that the initial agreement was signed on December 8.
We are still trying to win more benefits to our country before the last stage of signing the agreement. We have to complete the signing by January 8. The former agreement was to lease the Hambantota Port for 199 years, which we have now decreased to 99. We are trying our level best to decrease it to 45-50 years. We have won 50 percent of the demands that we made to the Chinese company. I shall be satisfied if we could win more benefits over to our side. Minister Ranatunga said.
We shall resume work in the Hambantota Port by next week. The protesters receive food and other facilities which shows that this is organised by some political figures. I again ask them to give up the protest, go home and come to work fresh the next day. We have thousands of applicants waiting to take up duties. We have requested from the Defence Ministry to provide us security to resume work at the Hambantota Port. If the protesters want to, they can carry on their protests in a non-violent manner, Minister Ranatunga said.

Work begins again on worlds tallest Christmas tree

The construction of the worlds tallest Christmas tree at Galle Face Green which was stopped has been recommenced, the Ports and Shipping Ministry stated in a release yesterday. The chairman of the committee entrusted the work on the Christmas tree, Mangala P.Gunasekera said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed Minister Arjuna Ranatunga to resume construction work. Gunasekera said Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and Minister Ravi Karunanayake had met Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjit and discussed about the Christmas tree before informing Ranatunga to resume construction.
The ministry in a media release stated that certain people informed the Archbishop of Colombo that government funds are being used for the construction which was incorrect.
Gunasekera said yesterday that his committee does not use funds from the ministry, Ports Authority or any other government institution but was only accepting help from private donors. They too are not providing monies but only the material, he said.
While noting that the Christmas tree will be open for public viewing from December 20, Gunasekera said that simultaneously several social welfare programmes too will be carried out including educational scholarships for needy children and donations to the Kidney Fund.
The project was halted on Wednesday after the Archbishop called it a wasteful expenditure and said the money should be used instead to build homes for the homeless or to provide scholarships for children.

Ronaldo clinches fourth Ballon d'Or title over Messi

Cristiano Ronaldo secured his fourth Ballon d'Or title Monday, beating old rival Lionel Messi to the title of world's best footballer over the past 12 months.
It capped a successful 2016 for Ronaldo, whocaptain Portugal to its first major international honourat the European Championships in France.
He also scored the winning penalty as Real Madrid defeated city rival Atletico Madrid towin the UEFA Champions League for the second time in three seasonsin May.
Ronaldo has now won just one less Ballon d'Or than 2015 winner Messi, whose Barcelona team beat Real Madrid to the Spanish La Liga title by one point.
Messi missed out on his first international title whenArgentina lost to Chile in Junes Copa America final-- he said that would be his last game for his country, butreversed that decision in August. Ronaldo was unable to attend the awards ceremony in Paris as Real Madrid had traveled to Japan to take part in the FIFA Club World Cup,holding six-point lead over Barca in La Liga after Saturdays win over Deportivo La Coruna.
"For me it's an unbelievable moment, I'm so proud, so happy,"he said in a pre-recorded interview. "Thank you to everyone who voted for me. Thank you to my teammates ... Portugal national team, and this trophy's for Real Madrid."
Although the 31-year-old had to leave the field after just 25 minutes of the Euro 2016 final against host nation France due to injury, his three goals and three assists had helped drag Portugal to the latter stages of the tournament.
It only qualified for the knockout rounds as one of the best third-placed group teams, drawing with Iceland, Austria and Hungary.
Following the end of its merged agreement with football's governing body FIFA, the 2016 Ballon d'Or award -- now run solely by its founder France Football magazine -- was decided by a vote of 173 journalists for the 30 nominated players.
In 2010-15, it also featured votes from national team captains and managers.
FIFA will award its ownprize for the worlds top performing player-- with Ronaldo, Messi andAtletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann shortlisted -- in a ceremony due to be held on January 9 in Zurich, Switzerland.
Griezmann, who was top scorer at Euro 2016 with six goals for losing finalist France, was third behind Messi in the Ballon d'Or voting.
Messi's Barca clubmates Luis Suarez and Neymar were fourth and fifth respectively ahead of Real's Gareth Bale, a semifinalist at Euro 2016 with Wales.
Ronaldo's success was foreshadowed late Sunday when an image purporting to show a leaked front cover of the latest edition of France Football -- declaring him the winner appeared on social media late Sunday.
Ronaldo first won the coveted prize in 2008, doing so again in 2013 and 2014. He and Messi have been the only winners since Brazil's Kaka took the honor in 2007.

The P-8A Poseidon aircraft arrived in Colombo on December 4, where its sailors met with Sri Lanka military personnel to demonstrate the capabilities of the P-8A and exchange expert advice.
The bilateral exercise is aimed at enabling the Sri Lanka Air Force and Navy to safeguard the international shipping lanes that are vital to global commerce.
This bilateral partnership with Sri Lanka security forces reinforces the global maritime rules that produces greater prosperity for all of us, U.S. Embassy Charg dAffaires Robert Hilton said.
The P-8A is a multi-mission aircraft that provides long-range maritime patrol capabilities, making it the most advanced ocean surveillance aircraft in the world.
The Red Lancers of Patrol Squadron TEN (VP-10) are stationed in Jacksonville, Fla. and are currently on a routine deployment to the Indo-Asia-Pacific, to ensure safety and security of vital sea-lanes and trade routes, integrating air and sea patrol operations.
The team departed Sri Lanka on Sunday, December 11 aboard the P-8A Poseidon from Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport in Hambantota.
We are pleased about the opportunity to partner with our friends in the Sri Lankan government and armed forces, said Lt. Anthony Beres, the detachment officer in charge of the Red Lancers said.
The P-8A Poseidon brings advanced capabilities to maritime safety patrols, search and rescue, counter-narcotics, and humanitarian and disaster relief efforts, and we appreciated engaging with the Sri Lankan Navy during this visit.
