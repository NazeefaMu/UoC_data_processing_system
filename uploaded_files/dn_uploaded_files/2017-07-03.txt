Lanka will be self-sufficient in salt by 2020
Lanka Salt Limited chairman Ayub Khan said Sri Lanka will have adequate stocks of salt for the country by 2020.
He was adressing a staff meeting held at the company recently.
The chairman said new salt fields were prepared at the Hambantota, Bundala, and Palatupana salterns. Old machinery and equipment were replaced with new ones and the extent of the salterns was increased to 2,600 acres, he said.
The chairman said the new management board in last year March found that the salt had been sold at loss. They appointed agents island-wide and increased the salt prices to cover the loss. He said 66 agents distribute salt island-wide at present.
The total consumption of salt in the island is 1,50,000 MT and 120,000 MT is used for domestic needs while the rest is taken for industrial use. By October 2017, the salt harvest will be 85,000 MT and by 2018, it will increase up to 1,1000 MT, he said.

Air India cleared for privatisation
India's cabinet has approved plans to privatise Air India.The debt-laden airline has been struggling to become profitable amid growing competition from low-cost rivals.
Finance minister Arun Jaitley said the government had given an "in-principle" approval for the stake sale.India will form a committee to decide on the details, including the size of the government's stake to be sold, he said.The committee will also decide whether India will write off some or all of Air India's Rs 520 billion (US$8 billion) debt pile.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been looking into ways to privatise Air India, which was given a $5.8 billion bailout in 2012 and relies on taxpayer funds to stay afloat.Privatisation plans have been abandoned before, however, and unions have threatened wide-ranging protests if ministers push ahead this time.
Once the country's only airline, Air India has lost market share to new entrants and suffered from a reputation for poor service and cancelled flights.
It remains India's biggest international carrier, flying to 41 destinations, and has just under a fifth of the market.
Air India has 14.6% of the domestic air travel market. (BBC)

[APPRECIATIONS - (03-07-2017)]
Asela (Stanley) Navaratne
Man of integrity
I sat down several times to write about my father who passed away about an year ago, but never thought that it would be so difficult and painful. Many tears came down when I thought about him. Finally, I decided that I will make up my mind to write something about him who has been very close to my mother, my sister and to me. Another reason for me to write about him was that he was my mentor throughout my life. If he was alive, he would be 91 years on September 20.
He was born on September 20, 1926, at Wattappola, in a remote village in Udunuwara close to Kandy, to a respectable Kandyan family and his parents were Navaratne Mudiyanselage Medduma Banda Navaratne and Soma Kumari Ganhatha Navaratne. His father was the principal of the Jinaraja College, Gampola and his mother was a housewife. When my father was 13 years of age, his mother died at a young age. His father passed away in 1945, after my father got married to my mother Anula Tittawella. He had one sister and seven brothers and my father was the eldest in the family. After his fathers death, he had an additional responsibility to look after the family until they were employed and married, which he did willingly as the eldest brother.
My father had his early education at Jinaraja College, Gampola and thereafter, at Dharmaraja College, Kandy. He was always proud of the two schools where he studied. Thereafter, he entered to University of Ceylon in 1946 and studied Pali, Sinhala and History and graduated with a BA degree in 1950. Some of his lecturers at the University were Professor B.E. Hettiarachchi and G.C. Mendis. He used to be proud that he was an undergraduate, while Dr. Ivor Jennings was the Vice Chancellor. Some of his contemporaries at the University were former Speaker of Parliament Stanley Tillekaratne, former Governor of the Central Bank Dr. W.M. Tillekaratne and Professor of Political Science at the University of Peradeniya Professor K.H. Jayasinghe.
After his graduation, he taught for about six months at the Sivali College in Ratnapura District and thereafter, joined the Public Service in 1950 as a Divisional Revenue Officer (DRO). His first posting was to the Kuruengala Kachcheri. Thereafter, he was posted to Batticaloa (Binthanne, in 1952), Badulla (Wellasa, in 1954), Mahanuwara (Ududumbara, in 1956), Mahanuwara (Medadumbara, in 1960), Kegalle (Dehigampala and Pahala Bulath Kohupitiya, in 1961), Mahanuwara (Harispaththuwa, in 1964), Mahanuwara Kachcheri.
He was the Deputy Director (Administration) at the Department of Agriculture until he was appointed Government Agent of Matale District. In 1977, after the general election, he was transferred to the pool at the Ministry of Public Administration and he refused to accept the said transfer and made a written appeal to the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration as he knew that some politician in Matale District who came to power in 1977 was behind his transfer and their motive was to get another officer whom they knew who was junior to him. The net result of his appeal was a transfer to Colombo as the Government Agent.
Thereafter, he assumed duties as the Government Agent of the Colombo District in 1978 and worked until he retired from the Public Service in 1986. During his career in the Public Service, he handled many elections and had been the Returning Officer for Matale and the Colombo Districts. He was involved in the Buddha Jayanthi Celebrations, Rural Development activities, National Savings Movement, Dharmaduta Missions and the Victoria Home for incurables at Rajagiriya. He worked under Stanley Maralande, W.H. Fernando and Dr. Ernest Abeyratne. He had many friends in the public service and associated with them until his death. He was very proud that by joining the Public Service, he was able to help the poor while he was serving in remote areas of the country. He used to relate stories on many incidents and from that I knew that he enjoyed working in outstations more than in the cities.
Thereafter, he joined the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Cooporation as Chairman and a Director for the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Cooporation. During the period that he worked in the Institution, there were many employees who were killed by terrorist activities which affected him personally. There were even death threats to him and we all were scared for his life during this period, but my father was not so; he only said that it was his duty to protect the Institution as well as the employees from terrorist activities. During this period, the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord was signed and there was public unrest all over the country; the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Cooporation had a major role to play to keep the public informed of the true situation.
Thereafter, he joined the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation as Chairman and a Director of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. The period that he worked in the Institution there were many employees who were killed by terrorist activities which affected him personally. There were even death threats to him and we all were scared for his life during this period but my father was not so and he only said that it was his duty to protect the Institution as well as the employees from terrorist activities. During this period the Indo-Lanka peace Accord was singed and there was public unrest all over the country and during this period the Sri Lanka Rupavahini corporation had a major role to play to keep the public informed of the true situation.
Subsequently, he was appointed as a Director of the Sri Lanka Aviation Authority and as a Commissioner of the Mediation Boards Commission. He always enjoyed working in the Government Sector and he did not have any majro problems with the Government in power as he was not affiliated to any political party. He closely worked with the then President J.R. Jayawardena, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranayake, Presidents Ranasinghe Premadasa and D.B. Wijetunga and Ministers T.B. Illangaratne, Hector Kobbekaduwa, Ananda Tissa de Alwiss, A.C.S. Hameed, Major Montague Jayawickreme, but he never asked for any favours for him or his family.
He was appointed to many Commissions of Inquiry, including the inquiry into the incident which occurred at the new Magazine Prisons in 1991 of the Remand Prisoners and the one-man Commission of inquiry to examine and report of the Security Division of the Peoples Bank. During his career in the Public Service, he worked hard with commitment and dedication. He was able to work long hours as Amma looked after the home front.
He was a person who distinguished clearly between right and wrong. He had the common touch and that was why he was loved and respected by many, including the staff who worked under him.
Everyone who had worked under my father had always endorsed this view and said that what they learnt from him had been utilised in their day-to-day work while he was living as well as after hearing of his death. According to them, he was a good administrator who was honest and had always been firm but kind and patient. Some of them had end up by being Secretaries of Ministers. He was prod of his juniors who did well in their chosen fields. Some of them used to visit him in Kandy or phoned him and used to have long chats till he passed away in July last year. He used to enjoy those chats very much and used to relate them when I visited him during the week ends when we used to have small chats at the Balcony at our Kandy house. But above all he was a man of integrity. I must proudly say that he had served the country in Silence.
He was devoted Buddhist. After his retirement, he was fully involved in Buddhist activities in Kandy and worked for the Buddhist Publication Society (BPS) and at the Center for Buddhism for many years. The center for Buddhism gave an alms-giving after his death in memory of him and some others who had worked for many years at the Centre, in January, this year. He wrote many articles to the newspapers on Buddhism and had done research in this area. The knowledge that he had about Buddhism was immense, which is ample testimony when I looked into the notes that he had made during his life time, after his death. He had lot of admiration towards bhikku bodhi and used to read his books. In addition, he used to read books written by Ven. Narada and Bhikku Nyanaponika and many others. His knowledge of dhamma was vast and he was able to have a good discussion on dhamma with his friends, neighbours and relations. He had collected many Buddhist books and magazines and akka and I will be the beneficiaries of his large collection of Buddhist books, articles and research papers which will help us to follow the path of dhamma, which he always believed.
Apart from Buddhism, he was interested in history, environment, constitutional laws, human rights, Terrorism, ethnic Issues, religious conversions, health issues, rebirth, drug policy, education and wrote to newspapers on many topics which I had the opportunity of reading after his death. He was so concerned about the motherland and proud to be born in Sri Lana. He always believed that terrorism could be curtailed by peace full negotiations, but by defeating them with power. He was of the view that this should be done for the sake of the Tamil Community in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces who were silently suffering due to terrorism.
Further, he always believed that devolution was not suitable for a small country like ours and that it is topic for the politicians to be in power. As an administrator throughout his life, he was of the view that the Provincial Council system was a white elephant. He always said that the common man, whether he is Tamil, Muslim or Sinhalese, only wanted a peaceful environment to live in with their families and to have decent living with a reasonable income to give a good education for their children. He was of the view that the ordinary man was never interested in political power.
He was calm and collected. He was a good listener and had lot of patience. He hardly got angry. His juniors and his friends always told, when he was living and as well as after his demise, that he had many good qualities and was a good human being who had helped many. I read many letters sent by many thanking him for such help (eg. To get a pension, a small land, for childrens education, to get jobs).
During his lifetime, he did many meritorious activities in silence. He used to contribute to many charitable organisations like Helpage and the Sri Lanka Cancer Society. He helped many children with their education and some of them got good jobs in Banks and Government Institutions. He used to give alms to the Buddhist monks at the Malwatte Temple annually which he did until his death. My father was the person who wanted me to joint the Attorney Generals Department and to please him, I allied and worked for almost 32 years. He was proud of my achievements and when I think back about him, I am happy that I did what he wanted me to do in life and I enjoyed it very much. The credit should go to him and Amma for my achievements.
Recently, I found a letter written to me in year 2007 when I was ill which I had kept in my safe custody. When I read it, I felt the love and the caring nature and the advice that he gave me to overcome the illness through Buddhist principles, which gave me the courage and the will to overcome the difficult period in my life.
He looked after my mother who is not in good health for many years with love and care, which is rare these days and that alone will give him merit to shorten the journey in sansara.
He led a simple life throughout his life. He selected Kandy, his hometown, to live in his retirement, in the house he built. The simple funeral in itself was a testimony for the life he led. One year has passed after his death. I really miss him. His demise from this world has created a void in my life and in our family.
The house is empty and the balcony that we used to sit and have chitchats on many topics during the weekend are only but a memory now. But his memory will live on in our hearts forever. But our lives will not be the same.
He has been a wonderful person to our family, relations, friends and others who associated with him.
I am thankful to him for everything he has done for Amma, Akka and I. I wish I could have written this while he was alive. I will try to live up to his expectations, which is not easy.
The only promise that I can give you, Daddy, is that I will look after Amma the way you looked after her, with love and care and make her life comfortable. I will try to lead the Buddhist path that you lived, following the teachings of the Buddha which you always believed.
May your journey in sansara be short, smooth and fruitful until you reach the ultimate goal of nibbana according to the Buddhist teaching that you always believed.

S (Vama) Vamadevan
Astute officer
Retired Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police S. Vamadevan passed away in Sydney on June 1, almost three months after his 84th birthday. He was the one who brought credit to Ceylon (later Sri Lanka) Police, both, by his ability, as well as personal example. I write this appreciation as a colleague who was perhaps the closest to him in the service. In fact, my wife and I were the only Police family at his wedding.
Vama and I were at the University of Peradeniya together. He was two years senior to me and was well-known as a soccer player of repute, captaining the Peradeniya side successfully. A very popular student, he was well-known for his sense of humour, perhaps something that created a comradeship between us. Several articles have appeared in the press about him, but I want to write mainly about his career in the service, which should really serve as an example to current members.
He joined the Service as a Probationary ASP in 1957, two years before me. His first outstation posting was in Kandy, where I succeeded him in 1961. Both of us served under Supt. Karl Van Rooyen, a tough, no-nonsense type officer, who instilled in us one of the most important dictums; we were there to serve the public, not to be slaves to departmental orders. Vama took to it like a fish to water, sometimes letting his feelings of duty overcome routine orders. Then he had a brief stint at Matugama until the attempted Coup of 1962 pitchforked him into the cauldron that was Colombo. He ran the Colombo West District, the toughest of the lot, covering the Fort and Pettah areas. Political turmoils, trade union chaos and serious crime had to be tackled with a depleted, demoralised force reeling in the aftermath of the attempted coup. This he accomplished despite having less than five years of Service under his belt.
Some tense situations were diffused through direct contact with the leaders. I know what it was like, as I too, was thrown into the same soup with even fewer years of service and allocated two districts, South and traffic, to run. Our predecessors were either in remand jail or on compulsory leave. Supt. Ivor Van Twest was brought in as SP Colombo and the two of us with another handful of junior ASPs were to help him restore morale and provide law and order to the city. Nothing loath, we stood four square to the wind and got on with the task. Vama, following the lead of Van Twest, led from the front and established a reputation as a firm, but fair officer, with a penchant for demanding immediate results. This earned him the sobriquet Vahama devan.
It was not all work. We had the good fortune of jointly participating in sporting activities, get-togethers, and most enjoyable of all, horse riding. Cross-country rides ending with a good breakfast or cantering along the beach to Mt. Lavinia, was indeed, fun. A keen horseman, Vama never missed these opportunities and as the Mounted Division was under his command, he and I spent considerable time on horseback. During this period, he commanded a parade to welcome the new IG S.A. Dissanayake. Vama commanded it on horseback, achieving a first ever record of commands being given in Sinhala, a little tongue-twisting for this lad from the North. He dealt with politicians and trade union leaders on a personal level, to prevent confrontations. The event I remember best was when he confronted a political heavyweight in maintaining peace in front of the Queens House and indeed, in the country. Sadly, it led to a posting to Nuwara Eliya. His great contribution was that the men under him gained the courage to stand up for what was right; they could count on his backing.
His next phase was undertaking training in intelligence work, in Tel Aviv and London and supporting the late IG Ana Seneviratne in reforming the Special Branch. Once again, I was part of the four-man group selected for the task. Later, Cyril Herath, one of the four, and Vama, headed the Intelligence Division; Vama being Intelligence Director General as his last post before retirement.
Vamas crowning achievement was the setting up of the Sri Lanka Police Reserve (SLPR) with retired SP Rajasuriya. The old police reserve could no longer meet current needs. The failed insurrection showed the need for a strong Reserve to support the under-strength Police Force. Starting in April 71, Vama built the SLPR from the bottom up. He handpicked a small, volunteer staff of Reserves led by an able Reserve Officer (who incidentally was to remain in that role for nearly 15 years) and developed it into an efficient, respected machine, providing much needed support to the regular police. This achievement never received due credit.
His stint as Commissioner of Police was also noticeable for the same qualities. He was a charismatic commander, and provided the City a period of peace despite some political turmoil. He left the post on promotion to the rank of DIG.
Vama was one of the few senior officers selected for the Overseas Command Course in UK. He implemented many things from his training in running Colombo Division. He was also responsible for the setting up of the Sri Lanka Branch of the International Police Association.
Deeply attached to his familywife Rajes and their two children, Vama was sometimes torn between the call of duty and the attachment to the family. I am sure that it gave him some anguish. Vamadevan retired from the Service in March 1983. He was just 50 years old. Perhaps that anguish had some say in that decision, as was perhaps the difficulties in working under seriously deteriorating conditions of political instability. By that time, I had left the country, but was in touch with him regularly. When I met him shortly afterwards in Colombo, he was looking forward to a peaceful life in retirement. A few months later came the disaster that was July 83.
The house he and his wife built with love, and all their belongings were destroyed. He had nothing more left in the country. The hurt that it caused, and also the fact that it had to be an Air Force Officer who removed the family to safety created a bitterness in him, as he had said so many times to me in Australia. Perhaps it was the reason why he never visited Sri Lanka again.
He was a great police officer. One of a rare breed, indeed.

Khairun Nisa Reyal
Teacher beyond compare
Khairun Nisa Reyal was a teacher at Gampola Zahira College at the time I was serving there as Principal. I remember her as a dedicated, hard-working teacher, always ready to shoulder any responsibility that would lead to the betterment of children in both, curricular and extracurricular activities of the school.
Khairun Nisa Reyal was blessed with three children and left no stone unturned to bring them up; she endowed them with sterling qualities which stood them in good stead later in life
This love and concern she extended to all students of Gampola Zahira College, will always be remembered with a sense of gratitude. She showered deep and abiding affection on all children without any regard to whose children they were. I have the happiness of reminiscing an incident some 42 years ago and this I do to demonstrate the importance of the contribution by individuals like Reyal, who made a collective effort for the welfare of children.
Gampola Zahira College had just ended a week-long celebration Zahira week to commemorate its 25th year, culminating in the college prize-giving. As dusk descended, the lights on the Gampola Zahira College gorgons were switched on, signalling the start of the carnival which was expected to be the grand finale celebration of the College. But we were asked by the police and the educational authorities to close school immediately as the JVP insurrection had erupted all over the country.
On the following day, all schools closed until further notice with only the teachers reporting at the school. What were we to do with the teachers when students are not present At this juncture, a decision was made that we should utilize this time to develop a model agriculture farm in the school premises. The staff participated in this initiative for the sake of the students. They prepared vegetable beds on which a variety of crops were grown. An experimental paddy field was also developed.
A thriving livestock and poultry farm also emerged. When the students returned, they were surprised to find a model farm developed by their teachers to enable them to involve in practical and applied agricultural studies.
It was at this time that Reyal joined the staff of Gampola Zahira. She took great interest in the farm and spent her spare time, weekends and holidays to help the farm to grow in stature.
She, along with the other teachers, encouraged and motivated the students to give their shoulder to their effort and as a result, the farm became a throbbing entity and helped in enhancing the image of the College.
Very soon, this farm was adjudged the best model farm among government schools in Kandy District. Students were also encouraged to set up home gardens using the knowledge they gained in the College farm.
Khairun Nisa Reyal, a exemplary teacher, any school would proudly have on its staff. Even more than ten years into her retirement, she, ably assisted by her daughter, was seen in the college premises supervising the improvement of infrastructural and learning facilities in the primary section initiated by her son Rizmi, using his personal funds.
It is my prayer that Gampola Zahirians will continue to be inspired by their teachers who contributed their share to make them what they are today. Gratitude, after all, is the hall-mark of Islam. May Allah grant Khairun Nisa Reyla Jennathul Firdouse.

The troops of the 1 and 6 Corps of Engineer Services are constructing two new temporary wards at the Negombo General Hospital for dengue patients after the hospital authorities brought the lack of warding facilities to the notice of the President when he recently visited the hospital.
Commander of the Army General Crisanthe De Silva responding to the SOS need instructed the Corps of Engineer Services, Sri Lanka Army Medical Corps, and Directorate of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers of the Army to immediately commence the construction and equip the two new wards with necessary medical accessories, manpower and all other paraphernalia as soon as possible.
Just two days after the visit of the President, the Engineer troops have partly completed the construction and are giving finishing touches to both buildings by Saturday.
The Sri Lanka Army Medical Corps will provide 25 Army personnel for medical assistance, while the Directorate of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers will equip both wards with saline stands and other medical accessories.
The Army will put up a separate laboratory to conduct blood tests and other laboratory procedures.

Brac Lanka Finance gained 17.33% W-o-W to close at LKR 47.40 while Industrial Asphalts gained 12.50% W-o-W to close at LKR 360.00. Royal Palms (+11.36% W-o-W) and Lanka Ventures (+11.11% W-o-W) were also amongst the gainers.
PC House was the weeks highest price loser, declining 50.00% W-o-W to close at LKR 0.10. Udapussellawa (-30.36% W-o-W), SMB Leasing[X](-25.00% W-o-W) & Union Chemicals(-22.71% W-o-W) were also amongst the top losers over the week.
Foreign investors closed the week in a net buying position with total net inflows amounting to LKR 1.06Bn relative to last weeks total net inflow of LKR 0.41Bn (+159.52% W-o-W).
Total foreign purchases decreased by 29.81% W-o-W to LKR 2.68Bn from last weeks value of LKR 3.82Bn, while total foreign sales amounted to LKR 1.62Bn relative to LKR 3.42Bn recorded last week (-52.43% W-o-W).
In terms of volume, JKH & Piramal Glass led foreign purchases while Vallibel Power and Chevron led foreign sales. In terms of value, JKH and Tokyo Cement[X] led foreign purchases while Chevron and Cold Stores led foreign sales.
Point of view
Equity markets closed at an 18-month high this week, as the benchmark price index gained ~32 points W-o-W to end ~47 points above the key 6700 index level.
Despite an 18 point loss early in the week, the broadshare market index managed to wipe off the losses over the remainder of the week, recovering by ~50 points largely due to active participation by HNI and foreigners.
Tokyo Cements strategic transaction (Ube Singapore Holdings acquired a 10% of stake in TKYO for LKR 769.8Mn) coupled with large parcels in JKH , Hemas , Amana Bank helped drive overall turnover levels, and crossings over the week accounted to 53% of the weeks total turnover of LKR 4.6Bn .
The daily average turnover for the week consequently crossed the LKR 1.0Bn mark for the third consecutive week, averaging LKR 1.15Bn which is ~19% higher than the Y-T-D average turnover of LKR 0.93Bn.
Foreign inflows from equities meanwhile persisted through the week, accounting to LKR 1059.0mn (cf. LKR 408.07mn last week) and helping the net inflow position over June to total LKR 2.76Bn.
The Y-T-D net inflow position to the Colombo bourse consequently remained at LKR 21.56Bn. June inflation figures released on Friday meanwhile, indicated a marginal increase in urban inflation levels (from 6.0% in May to 6.1% Y-o-Y in June) driven primarily by an increase in Food inflation. Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current positive momentum.
World Bank forecasts 2017E GDP at 4.7%
In its semi-annual update on the Sri Lankan economy, the World Bank (WB) projects a relatively favorable outlook within the context of policy reforms.
The Group added that the GoSL appears committed to implement its medium-term reform agenda aimed at improving competitiveness, governance and public financial management and that the continuation of reforms along with the IMF program should add to confidence.
The WB also noted that tax policy reforms should help revenue led fiscal consolidation while recent Monetary policy movements have indicated a readiness to take appropriate action to ensure stability resulting in the Groups more positive outlook on the country.
The WB estimates GDP growth in 2017E to reach 4.7% n 2017E (>5.0 beyond 2017), driven by private consumption and investment.
The Group also noted that the external sector is poised to benefit from the reinstatement of GSP+ to the EU while external buffers are projected to improve, amid the emphasis placed on purchasing foreign exchange, maintaining a flexible FX rate, and the sale of selected government assets.
The WB noted however that its outlook is subject to risks, namely external risks such as disappointing growth in Sri Lankas export economies and higher commodity prices, and domestic risks such as delays in passing structural revenue measures and slower than expected improvement in tax administration along with increasing occurrence/impact of natural disasters.

Australia A will not tour S. Africa unless MOU agreed
SYDNEY: Players will boycott an Australia A tour of South Africa this month in an escalation of their bitter dispute with Cricket Australia unless a new pay deal is agreed, the Australian Cricketers' Association said Sunday.
The players' union held an emergency meeting in Sydney where they decided to take action for the tour beginning on July 12 unless a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed with CA by Friday.
ACA chief executive Alistair Nicholson said a significant breakthrough was needed for the South Africa tour to proceed.
The latest development in the stalled pay dispute comes after both parties failed to reach an agreement on a new MOU before Friday's deadline after months of protracted negotiations.
It leaves as many as 230 male and female players unemployed and threatens fixtures including this year's prestige home Ashes series. AFP

Can you really have a book club for eight million people
In early January 2017, bright, colorful banners of grinning television personalities holding novels started popping up on the walls of New York City subway cars. The advertisements announced One Book, One New York, a joint venture between the Mayors Office for Media and Entertainment and digital media company BuzzFeed. The campaigns tagline, Aiming to get all of New York on the same pageliterally, outlined its simple premise. One Book was to be the largest book club in history.
The idea is not as new, or as strange, as it sounds. Community reading programs are nearly two decades old. In 1998, Seattle introduced the concept, and four years later, Chicago followed. Since then, interest has exploded. Today, the Library of Congress estimates there are more than 400 programs across the country. In an interview with WNYC, Commissioner Julie Menin says Chicagos program inspired her to bring One Book to NYC. The motivation was partly economic: Other cities that have done One Book programs have seen enormous spikes in sales of that particular book. Right now, we have about 65 independent bookstores in the city. The Bronx has no bookstore. Staten Island has one. These bookstores are under threat of closure, and one important economic reason we want to do this program is to make sure that people visit their local bookstore.
It wasnt the citys first attempt. In 2002, the idea died in committee when no one could agree on a book. This time, allowing New Yorkers to vote circumvented that obstacle. Five finalistsBetween the World and Me, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Americanah, The Sellout, and The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Waowere selected. In February, after 50,000 votes were cast, the 2013 novel Americanah by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie was declared winner.
Against one another
Then the workand readingbegan in earnest. The Mayors office released a calendar of events taking place throughout spring and summer. Penguin Random House donated over 1,500 copies to the citys libraries and developed a guide for book clubs. Digital subscription service Scribd made an audiobook available free for 90 days. But these were just resources. The question remained: would people participate Somebody recently described New York to me: its not one big city, its actually a ton of small towns, smushed right up against one another, says Isaac Fitzgerald, BuzzFeeds Books Editor.
If thats true, then how, exactly, do you get eight million people on the same page
THE BRONX
In the Bronx, it isnt so easy, according to life-long resident Nolle Santos. Santos is the entrepreneur behind crowdfunding project The Lit.Bar, the first independent bookstore in the Bronx in six years, and the only bookstore in the borough since Barnes and Noble shuttered its branch there in 2016.
Santos was invited to the launch party for One Book, but since then, she hasnt seen much visibility for the program in the Bronx. The problem is, without bookstores, Theres no space to bring readers together. Im sure that people are participating, but I just havent seen it, because Im the only one throwing literary events right now. Calling the Bronx a book desert, Santos says residents must travel to other boroughs to participate in literary events.

Mrs Bs timeless lesson
Personal values are peoples internal conception of what is good, beneficial, important, useful, desirable, constructive, etc. Values such as honesty, hard work and discipline can increase an employees efficacy in the workplace and help them serve as positive role model to others.
The definition of an attitude is a way of feeling or acting towards a person, thing or situation. Passion for a sport, dislike for a certain actor and negativity towards life, in general, are examples of attitude.
Core values are the fundamental beliefs of a person or organisation.
Discipline is the practice of training people to obey rules or a code of behaviour, using punishment to correct disobedience. I can explain all these things by a short true story. This happened long ago at Royal College.
A student had a habit of coming late to school. The head prefect noticed this and advised the student to bring a letter from a parent regarding his bad habit. The head prefect instructed not to come to school without this letter.
The next day the student came to school with a letter from his mother explaining reasons for her sons late coming and the matter was settled. Mother had requested to excuse her son and had advised the son to be punctual. The student was late Anura Bandaranaike. Mother was late Sirimavo Bandaranaike. The head prefect was late Neelam Thiruchelvam.
Sirimavo Bandaranaike was a powerful figure at the time.
Let us learn a lesson from this true short story.

Cricket: Sri Lanka eyes elephant menace at stadium

Sri Lanka is to deploy game wardens to stop wild elephants straying onto the pitch when the country hosts Zimbabwe for a series of one-day internationals at the Hambantota stadium.
Experts will be on hand for all three ODI games at the 35,000-capacity stadium, which is next to an elephant sanctuary, a wildlife official told AFP on Monday.
The stadium was built in 2009 under former president Mahinda Rajapakse, who was from Hambantota, but has hosted only a handful of matches because of its remote location and high maintenance costs.
"There had been a few instances when elephants broke through the fence and invaded the pitch at night," said the official, who asked not to be named.
"A jungle patch starts about 100 metres from the stadium and we are deploying 10 wardens to make sure that fans don't stray into that area and provoke the elephants," he told AFP by telephone from Hambantota.
He said there was a herd of about 25 elephants roaming the area, 240 kilometres (150 miles) south of Colombo, posing a potential threat to fans.
It is not the first time wildlife has disrupted games at Hambantota -- swarms of wasps that have taken up residence there have also caused problems.
The last ODI played at Hambantota was two years ago. Following a recent refurbishment, Sri Lanka Cricket scheduled the final three ODI matches against Zimbabwe at Hambantota.
The games will decide the series winner after the two sides notched a victory each in the first two games played at Galle.

Cyber criminals exploit  pirated software to fuel Malware  infections in Asia Pacific
The National University of Singapore (NUS) Faculty of Engineering today released the results of its new study, Cyber security Risks from Non-Genuine Software, which found that cyber criminals are compromising computers by embedding malware in pirated software and the online channels that offer them. The study was commissioned by Microsoft.
The study, which aims to quantify the link between software pira cy and malware infections in Asia Pacific, discovered that 100% of the websites that host pirated software download links expose users to multiple security risks, including advertisements with malicious programs.
Among other findings, it also found that 92% of new computers installed with non-genuine software are infected with dangerous malware.
The studys findings all point to the fact that uncontrolled and malicious sources of pirated software, particularly on the Internet, are being converted into effective means of spreading malware infections.
And what we would like to achieve with this report is to help users recognize that the personal and business risks and financial costs are always much higher than any perceived costs they save from using non-genuine software, said Associate Professor Biplab Sikdar from the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at NUS Faculty of Engineering, who led the study.
Pirated software is a major source for Malware infections
Software piracy is a recognized global problem and three in five personal computers (PCs) in Asia Pacific were found to be using non-genuine software in 2016. However, using pirated software expose users to a plethora of cyber threats.
Hackers and organized cyber criminals today are adept at exploiting information technology vulnerabilities and human errors to compromise computers for malicious and financial gains at the expense of organizations and individuals.
Cyber crime is predicted to cost the global economy an estimated US$ 6 trillion by 2021, said Keshav Dhakad, Assistant General Counsel & Regional Director, Digital Crimes Unit (DCU), Microsoft Asia.
While cyber security defenses continue to evolve, users are slow at adapting, whereas cyber criminals are constantly advancing their attack vectors (malware strains) and delivery mechanisms. Piracy of software is increasingly becoming a key vehicle for cyber criminals to exploit computer vulnerabilities and breach security measures with ease.
A NUS researcher investigating a website that offers pirated software downloads.
Key insights from the Cyber security Risks from non-genuine software report
The new study analyzed 90 new laptops and computers as well as 165 software CDs/DVDs with pirated software.
The samples were randomly purchased from vendors that are known to sell pirated software from across eight countries in Asia - Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Korea, and Philippines.
Researchers also examined 203 copies of pirated software downloaded from the Internet. This aligns with the trend where software is increasingly being acquired through online downloads channels.
Each of these samples was thoroughly investigated for the presence of malware infections using seven anti-malware engines  AVG AntiVirus, BitDefender Total Security, IKARUS anti-virus, Kaspersky Anti-Virus, McAfee Total Protection, Norton Security Standard, and Windows Defender.
A researcher sorting the CD and DVD samples acquired for this study.
Here are some key insights from the study:
1.Traversing the Malware Minefield  Downloading and Installing Pirated Software from the Internet
One of the most alarming insights from this report is the multitude of risks that users are expose to when they visit websites that offer pirated software downloads.
The study found that 100% of tested torrent hosting websites opened with multiple popup windows with suspicious advertisements.
Many of these contain links that download malware when clicked or show objectionable content such as pornography.
In addition, the researchers encountered the following risks and suspicious behaviors when downloading and installing pirated software found on peer-to-peer networks:
n 34% of the downloaded pirated software came bundled with malware that infect the computer once the download is complete or when the folder containing the pirated software is opened.
n 31% of the downloaded pirated software did not complete installation which suggests other motives behind their presence on torrent hosting websites.
These misleading torrents either tricked users into downloading malicious programs or are used to increase the traffic to the torrent hosting sites which subject the visitor to malware and unwanted advertisements.
n 24% of the malicious programs bundled with the pirated software downloads deactivated the anti-malware software running on the computer. Once the anti-malware engine is blocked, the downloaded malware installs itself on the computer.
n 18% of these installations prompt users to change default settings on browsers and install add-on toolbars during installation. These changes to the browser settings lead to new home pages and default search engine as well as unwanted toolbars.
n 12% of these installations require users to contact additional websites to complete the process. This is often portrayed as steps to obtain the license keys or cracks needed to activate the pirated software, and they can lead to popups and additional malware exposure.
2. Brand new computers with pirated software  unused but not uninfected
The study found that 92% of new and unused computers that had pirated software installed were pre-infected with malware. These computer samples were purchased from vendors that are known to sell non-genuine software.
The presence of malware in these computers is concerning as end-users expect these devices to be risk free. They might be less vigilant in checking for cyber threats and monitoring for suspicious activities that may alert them that their computer has been compromised.
3. Pirated software in DVDs/CDs  The classic and effective malware infection source
Out of the 165 DVDs and CDs samples acquired for this report, three in five (61%) contained malware. Infected discs contained an average of five pieces of malicious programs. In some cases, as many as 38 malware instances were found in just one DVD.
The researchers also observed that a number of pirated anti-virus software were embedded with malware.
Using these compromised, non-genuine security programs not only infect the computer, but also lull users into a sense of complacency, which may lead to further exploitation of the computers and the users data and information.
Types of Malware  Infections insights
The study found close to 200 malware strains in all the samples. Among those, Trojans were the most common category of high-risk cyber threats encountered, with a total of 79 unique Trojans malware strains.
They also comprise 51% of all malware found embedded in downloaded pirated software.
While Trojans usually depend on social engineering to trick or mislead users into executing them, bundling them with pirated software make it easier for cyber criminals to compromise PCs.
Once a Trojan is active on an infected computer, it installs a backdoor for hackers to access and command the device. This allows cyber criminals to steal confidential information, modify firewall setting, and delete or encrypt data. An enormous range of worms, viruses and droppers, which were created for stealing information and taking control of their host computers were also found in the samples.
These malicious programs can replicate without human intervention and have the capability to spread more rapidly.
Pirated software are effective malware carriers as cyber criminals are able to tamper the programs and embed malicious programs with files that auto run or are used for setup. This greatly increases the likelihood of the malware being executed on the computers and spread further in the network, said Associate Professor Biplab Sikdar, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore.
Although the risk of contracting malware through all sources of pirated software is high, the online medium is turning out to be a more potent infection vector.
It not only provides cyber criminals with the scale to attack anybody, anywhere, anytime, it also allows them to easily camouflage their malicious activities and attack remotely. This makes them harder to be detected and stopped.
Best IT/Cyber-Hygiene practices for individuals, small businesses and organizations
Pirated software remains a lucrative revenue stream for many cyber criminals and unscrupulous vendors. The Asia Pacific commercial market of non-genuine software has hit a high of US$ 19 billion in 2016.
The most effective defense against malware from pirated software is to use genuine software products. Consumers and small businesses can further protect themselves from pirated and counterfeit software as well as malware with the following best practices.
n Source and buy your computers and laptops from reputable vendors.
n Always insist on genuine software from your vendors and opt for computers which come pre-installed with genuine software by hardware manufacturers.
n When purchasing a computer, always request for an invoice which clearly calls out the software title and version which has been installed on the machine.
n Keep your software current with latest product updates and security patches, and strengthen your security posture by having a strong anti-virus software.
n Do not use old operating systems such as Windows XP which have reached their end of life.
For enterprises and government organizations, there are also several recommendations they can consider to build a stronger IT security ecosystem.
n Augment basic identity management systems with multi-factor authentication mechanisms to achieve greater levels of trust.
n Organizations should ensure that their software and operating systems are regularly updated and all security patches are applied immediately on release.
n All older and unsupported versions of software are recommended to be retired immediately once the modern and secure versions are available.
n All computing devices in an organization should be protected with a robust and reputable anti-malware solution. The anti-malware definitions should be updated every day to ensure up to date protection against cyber threats.
n Train employees on safe cyber practices and educate them on the importance of using trusted software platforms.
Organizations need to recognize that cyber security is no longer just a protector of online assets, it is also a critical business enabler. The KPMG 2017 CEO Outlook survey found that a significant proportion of CEOs (71%) saw their investment in cyber as an opportunity to find new revenue streams and innovate, rather than as an overhead cost, said Daryl Pereira, Head of Cyber Security, KPMG in Singapore.
However, cyber security vulnerability is at an all-time high  the 2017 Harvey Nash/KPMG CIO Survey found that a third of IT leaders organizations (32%) had been subject to a major cyber-attack in the past 24 months. Establishing a solid foundation for cyber-hygiene is vital to the success of any digital transformation journey.
For example, organizations need to embed security by design into their business processes and product designs right from the outset, and staff must be trained to recognize malware attacks and the need to use trusted software platforms.
Without a cyber security-ready mindset becoming part of your business DNA, it will be challenging for any company to innovate and stay relevant in todays digital age.

Deadly dengue!
Community Physician, Dengue Control Unit of the Health Ministry Dr. Preshila Samaraweera speaks to T N' C about Dengue fever: symptoms, causes and treatments.
Q  When should people seek medical treatment for fever
A  Ordinary people should seek medical treatment for fever from a qualified doctor or a hospital with a full blood Count Report in the second 24 hours from the onset of fever. The fever can be dengue.
But when it comes to the elderly, very young children, pregnant women, people who had undergone kidney transplant surgeries etc, people with suppressed immunity and those with chronic diabetes, chronic obstructive airways disease, heart, liver, kidney and metabolic diseases etc. they should seek medical treatment for fever immediately. They should seek medical treatment during first 24 hours from the onset of fever because it can be dengue.
Q  What are the complications and how can they be avoided
A - Medications such as Aspirin and Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) such as Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Diclofenac etc should not be taken. All fever patients should take Paracetamol only. No other medications, especially pain killers should be taken to control fever and body pain.
Q  What should be done if one contracts dengue a second or third time
A - Earlier Dengue type 1 was reported from Sri Lanka, but this time it is type II. When a person who got infected with type I in the past gets type 11, the possibility of developing complications in them is higher than non infected person. Therefore it is better to seek medical treatment without delay with the history of the first dengue infection. The other issue is when the NS1 Report indicates as `Negative while the patient is suffering from Dengue Type II. Therefore it is advisable to get a full blood Count and the Dengue Antigen Test (NS1) done together without taking only a Full Blood Count Report.
Q  What are the traits in current dengue outbreak 
A - The platelet count of the patients becomes very low after two days from the onset of fever. It is visible in many dengue patients who suffer from type II which is the current outbreak.
Q- How can we prevent dengue infection
A - By wearing long sleeves / fully covered dresses during day time, applying mosquito repellents, house screening (windows and doors) to prevent entry of mosquitoes, keeping bedrooms, kitchen and toilets well-lit, ventilated and airy so that adult female mosquitoes cannot hide inside houses and mosquito breeding places (containers with collection of water) should be inspected and destroyed/removed regularly (at least once a week) for better environmental management.
Treatment Tips
* All fever patients are advised not to take any other medication except Paracetamol to control fever. Other medications can cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Dengue Shock Syndrome. No home remedies should apply for fever.
* Medical treatment should be sought only from a qualified doctor, a state hospital or a private hospital.
* Mosquito repellents should be applied on the skin of the open parts of the body of children before sending them to the school.

Lauded for his innovative stance in insurance sales and marketing and for pioneering business development strategy, this aspect of Abeysekeras experience and expertise will stand him in good stead to lead the Company.
Aptly qualified for a position of this stature given his MBA from the University of Queensland, Abeysekera augments his knowledge and experience by being a Chartered Marketer and Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Marketing UK and Member of both the Chartered Management Institute UK and Institute of Certified Management Accountants. The fact that he has been a Past President of the Association of Professional Bankers Sri Lanka showcases the recognition and reputation he has garnered among both the marketing and financial industry fraternity, which augurs well as he steps into his new role.
The input, leadership and value Abeysekera infuses into Peoples Insurance will undoubtedly be of immense advantage to this seven year old company, which in the last financial year ending December 31 2016 saw its annual premiums exceed Rs 4 billion spread over 150,000 insurance policies. Quoted on the Colombo Bourse and backed by two of the largest financial institutions in the country, Peoples Leasing & Finance and Peoples Bank while being supported by reputed international reinsurers, PIL can use Abeysekera expertise to continue growing the outstanding performance the company has been posting since inception.

Eat it fresh!
Leaf vegetables, also called potherbs, greens, vegetable greens, leafy greens, or salad greens, are plant leaves eaten as a vegetable. Nearly one thousand species of plants with edible leaves are known. Garden Talk speaks to Director Institute of Indigenous Medicine Swarna Hapuarachchi who furnished the Daily News with information on Lettuce which is known for its nutritious, religious, historical and cultural significance.
This incredible leafy vegetable has more health benefits that you can possibly imagine. Leafy vegetables are typically low in calories and fat, and high in protein per calorie, dietary fiber, vitamin C, pro-vitamin A carotenoids, folate, manganese and vitamin K. Lettuce is very easy to grow, and as such has been a significant source of sales for many seed companies Indigenously, it is found in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is most widely used in salads all over the world and finds its place among the list of nutritious foods. Apart from salads, it is also used in soups, sandwiches and wraps. It is also used for the purpose of juicing, said Hapuarachchi.
Lettuce's native range spreads from the Mediterranean, although it has been transported to almost all areas of the world. Plants generally have a height and spread of 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in). In the world at large the leaves are colorful, mainly in the green and red color spectrums. There are also a few varieties in the world with yellow, gold or blue-teal leaves. Lettuces have a wide range of shapes and textures, from the dense heads of the iceberg type to the notched, scalloped, frilly or ruffly leaves of leaf varieties.
Lettuce plants have a root system that includes a main taproot and smaller secondary roots. Some varieties, especially those found in the United States and Western Europe, have long, narrow taproots and a small set of secondary roots. Longer taproots and more extensive secondary systems are found in varieties from Asia, pointed out Hapuarachchi.
Proper selection plays a vital role in ensuring that you are buying fresh vegetables. As far as lettuce is concerned, always prefer whole heads of lettuce over loose lettuce leaves as they are fresher and more nutritious. Also, ensure that the leaves are crisp, tender and brightly colored.
Lettuce can be best enjoyed if it is fresh and crisp. Dark green veggies are great sources of vitamin C, folate, beta-carotene, iron, calcium, iron and dietary fiber.
Therefore, try to look for dark colored leaves. Lettuce is delicious as long as it is fresh. While shopping for lettuce, you should avoid bunches that are limp, wilting, brownish or have rust, spots or holes on them, explained Hapuarachchi.
Many people love growing lettuce in their garden. Nothing tastes better than a fresh salad made from lettuce you picked only minutes earlier!
Benefits for Skin
With growing pollution levels, exposures to harmful chemicals, stress and improper diet, skin problems have become a common sight these days. Some of the skin benefits of lettuce are as follows:-
* Revitalizes Skin
Lettuce is a rich source of vitamin A, with six leaves providing more than 100% of your daily value of vitamin A.
* Protects Skin from Pollution & UV Rays
The combination of vitamin E and vitamin C in this vegetable helps in keeping your skin healthy as you age.
* Removes Toxins
Consumption of lettuce stimulates appetite and removes toxins from the body
* Stimulates Hair Growth
Drinking lettuce juice on a regular basis stimulates hair growth by furnishing food to the nerves and roots of hair
Culinary facts
* If leaves are cooked for food, they may be referred to as boiled greens.
* Leaf vegetables may be stir-fried, stewed, steamed, or consumed raw. Leaf vegetables stewed with pork are a traditional dish in soul food and southern U.S. cuisine.
* They are also commonly eaten in a variety of South Asian dishes such as saag.
* Many green leafy vegetables, such as lettuce or spinach, can also be eaten raw, for example in sandwiches or salads. A green smoothie enables large quantities of raw leafy greens to be consumed by blending the leaves with fruit and water.
* Lettuce is most often used for salads
* In addition to its main use as a leafy green, it has also gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries of human consumption. Europe and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce, but by the late 20th century the consumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world.
* Lettuce was first cultivated by the ancient Egyptians who turned it from a weed whose seeds were used to produce oil, into a food plant grown for its succulent leaves and oil-rich seeds.
* Lettuce spread to the Greeks and Romans, the latter of whom gave it the name lactuca, from which the English lettuce is ultimately derived. By 50 AD, many types were described, and lettuce appeared often in medieval writings, including several herbals. The 16th through 18th centuries saw the development of many varieties in Europe, and by the mid-18th century cultivars were described that can still be found in gardens.
Health benefits
Lettuce leaves promote general health. Here are few of the lettuce benefits for health:
* Aids in Better Sleep
Drinking this lettuce infusion induces a good night sleep yielding the resultant benefits to the skin
* Weight Loss
The count of calories in lettuce is low, less sugar food plus they have good fiber.
* Prevents Lung Cancer And Mouth Cancer
Lettuce leaves are high on vitamin A. Vitamin A helps in preventing cancer. It helps a great deal in lowering the risk on mouth cancer and lung cancer too.
* Increases Metabolism
Iron, calcium, magnesium and potassium present in lettuce leaves increase metabolism of the body. Potassium actually helps in controlling heart rate and blood pressure. Apart from the above-mentioned benefits lettuce leaves are a good source of B-complex.
* Vitamin C
Vitamin C in lettuce is a rich source of antioxidants that prevent free radical formation and curb unwanted reactions that cause diseases and even cancers.
* Iron
Iron is important for the blood hemoglobin amount and also for many other heart-related benefits. Iron content can be very well-balanced with lettuce leaves as they provide almost four times the iron in some varieties.
* Proteins
Proteins are the building blocks of a developing body. They are needed for muscle development and many important metabolic reactions in the body. Lettuce contains a good 20 per cent of proteins in its total quantity.
* Low Glycemic Index
Due to the less caloric value of lettuce, its glycemic index is considered zero and thus, its consumption helps in maintaining blood sugar levels.
Historical facts
* Lettuce was first cultivated in ancient Egypt for the production of oil from its seeds.
* This plant was probably selectively bred by the Egyptians into a plant grown for its edible leaves, with evidence of its cultivation appearing as early as 2680 BC.
* Lettuce was considered a sacred plant of the reproduction god Min, and it was carried during his festivals and placed near his images.
* The plant was thought to help the god "perform the sexual act untiringly."
* Its use in religious ceremonies resulted in the creation of many images in tombs and wall paintings.
* The cultivated variety appears to have been about 75 cm (30 in) tall. These upright lettuces were developed by the Egyptians and passed to the Greeks, who in turn shared them with the Romans. Circa 50 AD, Roman agriculturalist Columella described several lettuce varieties  some of which may have been ancestors of today's lettuces.
* Lettuce appears in many medieval writings, especially as a medicinal herb. Hildegard of Bingen mentioned it in her writings on medicinal herbs between 1098 and 1179, and many early herbals also describe its uses. In 1586, Joachim Camerarius provided descriptions of the three basic modern lettuces  head lettuce, loose-leaf lettuce, and romaine
* Lettuce was first brought to the Americas from Europe by Christopher Columbus in the late 15th century.

Enhancing environment of Knuckles Conservation Forest
Biodiversity Sri Lanka together with HSBC and IUCN Sri Lanka have been working together on measures to conserve and improve the mini watershed area of the Puwakpitiya Oya in the Knuckles Conservation Forest and Environmental Protection Area.
This engagement has been ongoing since August 2015 and is a three- year intervention. As a responsible corporate entity and a patron member of Biodiversity Sri Lanka, HSBCs sustainability drives underpin identifying and addressing environmental, social and ethical developments which present risks or opportunities for environment and business. Technical assistance to the project is provided by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, Sri Lanka (IUCN).
The Knuckles Conservation Forest along with the Peak Wilderness Protected Area and the Horton Plains National Park have been declared as an UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2010.
Prior to this, it was declared as a conservation forest by the Forest Department in 2000 and an Environmental Protection Area under the National Environmental Act in 2007. The Knuckles area constitutes 30 percent of the watershed forest of the Mahaweli catchment - a major source of water for the agricultural sector of the country.
Although the forest landscapes in the Knuckles region are managed by the Forest Department and are legally protected, some landscapes are heavily degraded due to anthropogenic activities. Unsustainable land use practices and deterioration of watersheds severely threaten biodiversity and associated ecosystems. The main aim of the project is to restore the ecological value of the Puwakpitiya Oya sub-catchment area in order to enhance watershed functions and biodiversity in order to develop a replicable model to expand the programme to other sub-catchments of this vital forest range.
Puwakpitiya is a highly visited location by local tourists. Hence improving the visitor facilities of the Puwakpitiya (Illukumbura) office of the Forest Department is a part of this project. The HSBC funds have helped the construction of an information centre alongside the development of necessary knowledge products, which will benefit both the Forest Department and the visitors. This centre is expected to be declared open in August 2017.
Although adequate sanitary facilities are a basic need of any household, most of the toilets in the Puwakpitiya area are below standard hygienic levels. Regrettably, a majority of the people within the community do not recognize safe toilet facilities as a basic human need.
The project has improved and promoted the construction of adequate toilet facilities and raised awareness on the importance of sanitation.This is considered to be an eye opener to the villagers and it has been catalytic in getting the villagers to realize associated values. The project is expected to bring about a change at local level, which will have a lasting impact beyond the lifetime of the project.
Since the project area is located within the immediate catchment of the Moragahakanda reservoir, community members are being made aware of crucial conservation aspects through community discussions and meetings. Raising awareness among the community members could finally contribute positively to the conservation of the forest and its buffer zone together with the upper catchment of the Moragahakanda reservoir.
Recently a group of volunteers from HSBC made a field visit to observe and take part in work on ground. This volunteer programme included a visit to the Illukkubura Visitor Centre from June 16-18 where staff actively participated in landscaping and cleaning the centre. They also conducted a visitor awareness programme at Sera Ella.The team actively took part in field interventions and constructed contour barriers on the hilly edges to prevent soil erosion.
Upon completion, the project will have multiple environmental benefits. Firstly, the Knuckles region is well-known for its natural and aesthetic beauty centered on its breathtaking landscapes and associated fauna and flora.
Sustainable utilization of this valuable asset can be achieved through proper conservation and management practices.
Secondly, this region has been declared as one of Sri Lankas Natural World Heritage sites namely the Central Highland World Heritage Site because of its unique biodiversity, aesthetic value and ecosystem services. Hence, conservation and management practices will eventually lead to conserving this pristine and valuable ecosystem.
Enhancing watershed services, micro-climate regulation and carbon sequestration would provide both socioeconomic and environmental benefits. A monitoring system will be developed to ensure the sustainability and continuation of the positive outcomes of this project.

Envy a futile implosion of a destructive emotion
Theres a reason its called the green-eyed monster -- jealousy is ugly. And where did it ever get you, anyway Whether you fear losing a relationship or wish you had things other people have, you need to let go. When it comes to your relationships, nothing is more attractive than genuine confidence. And as for having stuff, remember: You cant take it with you, so why fret about what youre supposedly missing
A combination of emotions
Jealousy is possibly the most destructive emotion housed in the human brain. Jealousy is a complex emotion that encompasses many different kinds of feelings that range from fear of abandonment to rage to humiliation. Jealousy can strike both men and women when they perceive a third-party threat to a valued relationship, it can be a problem among siblings competing for parental attention, or envy for a wealthier more successful friend.
Conventional wisdom holds that jealousy is a necessary emotion because it preserves social bonds. But jealousy usually does more harm than good to relationships, and can create relationship conflict and violence. Jealousy is an emotion, and the word typically refers to the thoughts and feelings of insecurity, fear, concern, and anxiety over an anticipated loss of status or something of great personal value, particularly in reference to a human connection.
Jealousy often consists of a combination of emotions such as anger, resentment, inadequacy, helplessness and disgust. In its original meaning, jealousy is distinct from envy, though the two terms have popularly become synonymous in the English language, with jealousy now also taking on the definition originally used for envy alone. Jealousy is a typical experience in human relationships. It has been observed in infants five months and older. Some claim that jealousy is seen in every culture. However, others claim jealousy is a culture-specific phenomenon.
Its no fun to feel envy or jealousy because both make you feel inadequate. Envy basically is when you want what someone else has, but jealousy is when youre worried someones trying to take what you have. If you want your neighbours new swank vehicle, you feel envy. If she takes your husband for a ride, you feel jealousy.
Lovers triangles
Envy requires two parties, such as you and that neighbour, when you want her new car and you wish you were the one riding around town in real style. You feel envy when you want something someone else has. Jealousy requires three parties, like you, your neighbour, and your husband, when not only do you wish you had that cool car, but youre worried your husband is going to ride off into the sunset in it without you. Jealousy is exciting theatre because it shows up in lovers triangles and Shakespeares plays:
Overcoming jealousy is like changing any emotional reaction or behaviour. It begins with awareness. Awareness allows you to see that the projected stories in your mind are not true. When you have this clarity you no longer react to the scenarios that your mind imagines. Jealousy and anger are emotional reactions to believing scenarios in your mind that are not true. By changing what you believe you change what your imagination is projecting and you can eliminate these destructive emotional reactions. Even when there is justification for the reaction, jealousy and anger are not beneficial ways to deal with the situation and get what we want.
A survey of therapists revealed that jealousy was the major problem in one-third of all clients seeking psychotherapy. Makes sense when you consider that its one of the most complex and intense human emotions. Born of a cocktail of frustration, suspicion, envy, and sadness, jealousy can tempt you into totally irrational behaviour, which you, in a better state of mind, would never consider or condone.
At the core, jealousy stems from insecurity. Talking about insecurity is one of the most vulnerable things a person can do. Its admitting to a belief that you are inadequate. It is never easy. But within a loving, supportive relationship, it will only ever change things for the better. On the other hand, if the issue of jealousy isnt resolved, your relationship will inevitably fail.
Primal emotions
Of all the emotions humans show, jealousy is one of the most common and unsettling. It tends to bring out the worst in us, even though most of us know better. Its an age-old problem, having been recorded since biblical times, and no doubt experienced even before that. And its not limited to humans, either. Even wild animals like chimpanzees and elephants exhibit jealous tendencies.
We all feel jealous from time to time but admitting it is the first step to overcoming it. Jealousy is not limited solely to relationships. You can become jealous of your friends or associates good fortune. This also ties in to feelings of self-worth. A person who doesnt have a strong self-image may feel that hes not getting his fair share and that others always get the breaks.
Envy, jealousy, and shame are inextricably intertwined. Envy and jealousy are primal emotions that frequently overlap. Theyre commonly first felt in the form of sibling rivalry and Oedipal longings. A child innately wants mommy and daddy all to him  or herself and feels excluded from the marital bond, especially if there have been parenting deficits that have led to shame and emotional abandonment.
Children are frequently envious and jealous of the attention showered on a newborn sibling. Belief that a sibling is favoured can create lifelong feelings of shame and inadequacy. No one enjoys feeling jealous. Yet, jealousy is an inevitable emotion that pretty much every one of us will experience. The problem with jealousy isnt that it comes up from time to time, but what it does to us when we dont get a grip on it. It can be frightening to experience what happens when we allow our jealousy to overpower us or to shape the way we feel about ourselves and the world around us. That is why understanding where our jealous feelings actually come from and learning how to deal with jealousy in healthy, adaptive ways is key to so many areas of our lives from our interpersonal relationships to our careers to our personal goals.
Finally remember, there will always be someone out there who is more beautiful, more talented, and more successful. But so what

Fashion dominates Africas biggest horse race
DURBAN, Saturday  Combining high fashion with sport, nearly 50,000 racegoers marked the 120th anniversary of Africas biggest horse race on Saturday at a packed course in the South African coastal city of Durban.
The annual Durban July handicap race attracts one of the continents most fashion-conscious crowds, with the trackside glamour and party atmosphere often threatening to overtake the horse action.
Me and my friends always come here for the entertainment and fashion, we know nothing about horses and betting, said Thina Thusi, a 31-year-old public relations manager from Johannesburg.
We usually start planning for this day from February -- the clothes to match perfectly, plus travel arrangements and entertainment, she said. It requires a lot of money.
The race, held at Greyville racecourse on the first Saturday of July, traditionally attracts a host of South African celebrities and politicians keen to be seen at one of the countrys biggest social occasions.
President Jacob Zuma is usually a regular at the race, surrounded by loyal ANC party supporters and wealthy business leaders who pay thousands of dollars for access to the powerful elite.
But the ANC held a major conference in Johannesburg this weekend, keeping Zuma away and depleting the political contingent at the track.
Among the crowds was renown fashion follower Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, as well as Bongi Ngema, who is one of Zumas four wives, King Letsie III of Lesotho and many television personalities.
For fans, the race combines a fun betting opportunity with old-world charm and South Africas exuberant modern social culture. Everyone wants to be at the Durban July, Its like a national day, the country comes to a standstill, said Gill Mostert, spokeswoman for Gold Circle, the countrys racing and betting company.
Fashion has always been a big part of the Durban July, even in the 1900s. People of all ages, even grannies from old-age homes, set out to dress well and have fun.
This years theme -- The Colour of Magic -- saw participants experimenting with multi-coloured outfits and outlandish hats, vying for best-dressed prizes. Ladies in high heels and men in tuxedos and designer suits paid limited attention to the horses, as champagne and buffet lunches were served in dozens of plush marquees lining the trackside.
As live music drifted across the course, models dressed by top South African designers such as Terrence Bray sashayed down makeshift runways at several fashion shows.
The first recorded race event in South Africa took place in 1802, since when the sport has developed into a major gambling draw.
Saturdays 12 races were expected to attract 200-million rand ($15 million/13 million euros) in bets from punters nationwide. According to Imagine Racing magazine, a win in the race places a horse in an elite group of equine champions and paves the way for a potential stud career.
Tourism officials said the event generates about $20 million in revenue for the city of Durban. - AFP

Federer poised for record Wimbledon triumph
LONDON, Sunday  Twelve months after shutting down his season in the wake of a devastating semi-final defeat, Roger Federer returns to Wimbledon as favourite to capture a record-breaking eighth title and become the tournament's oldest champion.
The evergreen Swiss, who turns 36 in August, has stunned the critics who wrote him off as yesterday's man when he went down to Milos Raonic in five gruelling sets on Centre Court in 2016.
The loss forced him off tour for the remainder of the year to rest a knee injury, leaving his Grand Slam title count on 17 where it had been since 2012.
Fast forward a year and Federer is poised to break the tie for seven Wimbledon titles he shares with Pete Sampras and take his career tally at the majors to 19.
With eternal rivals Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic in slumps of varying degrees, and Rafael Nadal fretting over whether or not his knees will bear the stress of grass courts, it is Federer once again in the box seat.
Federer, who captured a fifth Australian Open in January, will go into Wimbledon buoyed by a ninth title on the grass of Halle and refreshed by skipping the claycourt season.
However, he will not write off his three major rivals with whom he has shared all the Wimbledon titles since his maiden triumph in 2003.
If Andy is anything close to 100% physically, I consider him one of the big favourites to win. It's that simple. It's the same for Novak and the same for Rafa, said Federer who will start his Wimbledon campaign against Alexander Dolgopolov of Ukraine.
I think it's very even when we put it all out on the line. Everybody has their own little story right now.
For tennis storylines of 2017, Federer shares top billing with Nadal after the Spaniard defied the doubters to win a 10th French Open.
That took him to 15 Grand Slam titles, one ahead of Sampras and just three behind Federer.
But for Nadal, Wimbledon has always been bittersweet.
He was champion in 2008 -- where he beat Federer in a final widely regarded as the greatest ever played -- and 2010 as well as finishing runner-up in 2006, 2007 and 2011.
Injury forced him to skip Wimbledon in 2009 and 2016 while the years 2012-2015 saw him lose to Lukas Rosol (world ranked 100), Steve Darcis (135), Nick Kyrgios (144) and Dustin Brown (102).
A fourth round run in 2014 represents his best recent effort.
Nadal admits that if he suffers a new problem with his knees on the Wimbledon grass, where the lower bounce of the ball piles more pressure on the legs and joints, then his visit to London may again be short-lived.
BITTERSWEET FOR NADAL
If I have pain in the knees, then I know from experience that it's almost impossible, said the 31-year-old. Nadal, who could face Federer in the final, opens against John Millman of Australia, added that the first week will be crucial.
If I am able to go through at the beginning, I think I'm with confidence.
Defending champion Murray is fresh off a first round exit at Queen's at the hands of Australian world number 90 Jordan Thompson.
The world number one, who was also Wimbledon champion in 2013, has also been dogged by a hip problem which left him grimacing in pain in training this week.
Murray opens proceedings on Centre Court on Monday against lucky loser Alexander Bublik with coach Ivan Lendl insisting the champion will be fit. Unlike before Paris, he is hitting the ball really well. Practice has gone well, said Lendl. - AFP

Fire erupts in Rajagiriya super market
A fire broke out in Laugfs super market in Rajagiriya yesterday morning. The fire brigade of the Kotte Municipal Council responding to Daily News said they were alerted about the fire around 5.25 in the morning.
A team sent by the Kotte Fire Department has reached the location within five minutes following the alert.
They have doused the fire assisted by the Colombo Municipal Council fire brigade. The fire caused extensive damages to the supermarket, the Kotte Fire Department said. No causalities were reported.
Police suspect that the cause of the fire was an electrical short circuit. Investigations are continuing.
While praising the fire brigades quick response to the situation, Minister Harsha de Silva said he has requested a full report regarding the incident.
Posting in social media, Minister Harsha de Silva said there are numerous issues regarding the location, equipment to reach high rises, staff, training and more, with respect to emergency responding.
The Kotte fire trucks must be placed in a central location instead of where it is now at the very corner of the division down a narrow lane after the former location in Nugegoda was converted in to a park.
I have brought this to the attention of the SJPK MC since 2012, but to absolutely no avail. I think the time has come to find an alternative solution to fix the problem before a disaster happens, Minister de Silva said.

Former Colombo Chief JMO suspended
The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) has suspended former Colombo Chief Judicial Medical Officer(JMO) Prof Ananda Samarasekara from medico-legal practice for six months following a formal inquiry on removing slain ruggerite Wasim Thajudeens body parts and bones.
Prof Samarasekara was the former Colombo Chief Judicial Medical Officer who performed the first postmortem examination on Thajudeens charred body found in 2012. He is the Head of the Forensic Medicine Department of SAITM. When the second autopsy was carried out in 2015 by exhuming Thajudeens body, it was found that the chest plate, trachea (windpipe) and two long bones which had symmetrical fractures were missing.
The SLMC received an order from the Colombo JMO who carried out the second autopsy to investigate and find out whether removal of those body parts was done following the proper procedure or whether it accounts for medical negligence.
The SLMC panel that conducted the inquiry for six months found Prof Samarasekara guilty of three out of six charges, an SLMC member told the Daily News.
He said the SLMC findings would be informed to the court in writing on Monday.
Prof Samarasekaras SLMC registration has been suspended for six months with effect from last Friday.
Without SLMC registration he could not engage in private practice as well, he stated.
However, when the Daily News contacted a legal counsel to Prof Samarasekara, he said the disciplinary committee of the SLMC has not found him guilty of intentionally or negligently misplacing or losing the bones of Thajudeen, but has found him guilty of failing to follow the procedure laid down in certain documents when body parts were removed.
His name has not been suspended from being a medial practitioner.
He has only been suspended from engaging in medico-legal practice for six months. That means he cannot function as a JMO, but that does not matter because he is retired from the public service.
He is only working at SAITM and there is nothing that prohibits him from functioning at SAITM.
He continues to be a doctor, he said.
We will be challenging the SLMC findings because in our opinion he could not have been found guilty of any charge whatsoever and should have been exonerated. We are contemplating to take legal action against the SLMC decision, he added.

FrogLog to save animals from death
Having a swimming pool is a super fun way to stay cool during the summer. For the small animals living in your backyard, however, it can be a death trap. Wildlife biologist Rich Mason is out to change that with his simple, yet ingenious invention  the FrogLog.
In June of 2004, good friends who had recently built an in-ground swimming pool on their wooded lot near Baltimore, Maryland, called to let me know frogs were dying in their pool, Mason wrote on his official website. Deeply troubled by what he was hearing, Mason decided to construct a life-raft of sorts that animals could use to climb out of the pool if they became trapped.
The FrogLog consists of an inflatable platform with an attached mesh skirt, a weighted pouch that secures the device to the pools edge, and mesh ramp connecting the two ends. Mason fashioned the prototypes of the FrogLog completely by hand using fabric and foam.
After Masons thoughtful invention made headlines on The Dodo, it managed to attract over 68 thousand likes, and a wave of praise. What a special human you are [for] caring about [these] seemingly insignificant lives one user commented. Every creature deserves a chance to survive, and the FrogLog is now one more way to make sure that happens.

GMOA to launch strike on July 5

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said today that an indefinite strike will be launched on July 5.
The strike is against legalizing the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe.

GMOA, Prof. Carlo changed Sherifdeen Committee recommendations: SB
The Prof. Sherifdeen committee appointed on the initiative of the Sri Lanka Medical Council to go into the Malabe Private Medical College recommended that students passing out from the College should be registered in the SLMC and given the right to practice as doctors.
But this recommendation made in the final page of the report was changed due to the pressure exerted by Prof. Carlo Fonseka and the GMOA, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Villages Minister S. B. Dissanayake said.
Speaking to the Media after participating in a ceremony at Pilimatalawa, Kandy on July 1 Minister Dissanayake said he had made a major Contribution towards strengthening free education as Minister of Higher Education in the previous government. Among them was the increase of the intake to universities from 17,000 to 27,000 students. His ultimate motive was to increase it to 50,000.
He said at that time 8 Engineering degree awarding institutes and 11 Management degree awarding institutes were registered at that time the gazette notification setting up the Malabe Medical College was also issued under his name. Furthermore the Buddhist Academy at the Sri Dalada Maligawa was also awarded degree awarding status. All this was done with the full support of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who held office as President.
Out of nearly 300,000 students sitting A/L examination about 175,000 obtained sufficient marks to enter universities but only about 27000 finally gained the opportunity to gain admission. Another 8000 or so students registered for degree courses at private institutions.
A considerable number of students went abroad to gain medical degrees. The Malabe Private Medical College was instituted under a correct procedure with full legal status and foundation and it gained the approval of the Deans of all Medical faculties as well as the UGC after 18 rounds of inspections.
When problems cropped up regarding this at a later stage the Prof. Sherifdeen Committee was appointed but that report was distorted at the behest of Prof. Carlo Fonseka and the GMOA.
If the SLMC denied registration to medicos passing out from the Mabale Medical College the Minister of Health had the right to take a decision about it as done by late Mrs Renuka Herath and A. H. M. Fowzie when they were Ministers of Health at various times. But the incumbent Health Minister without acting on his own had taken a more democratic decision by referring the matter to the supreme Court for a final decision.
Minister Dissanayake said almost 95 percent of doctors who are members of the GMOA opposed the autocratic moves of the GMOA hierarchy which protested against the Malabe Medical College.
If the clinical practice was insufficient for Malabe students the government intervened to provide more clinical practice.
It was most regrettable to see the GMOA arguing that the Malabe students lacked clinical experience after obstructing government attempts to provide them with rigorous clinical experience.
If the GMOA stated that the country did not require private medical Colleges it should agree to ban private channelling practice for government doctors who have been educated with public funds.
Dissanayake said children of certain JVP leaders studied in Private Universities and children of about 100 doctors were studying at the Malabe Medical College.

Go on a Date  With Yourself
I remember a time after I left the University and started work at the Sunday Observer when I would read 5-6 books a week! I would go to the second-hand bookshops at Gamini Hall whenever I wanted to, roam around Pettah because the place fascinated me or even hop on a bus to travel to Galle on my own to see my grandma. I still love to read. I enjoy browsing in bookstores and traveling to Galle even though grandma is no more and traveling on the expressway is so boring. All those things I loved in the past, I still love. But sadly in this life in which I work fast, eat fast, walk fast, even sleep fast, when days blur into weeks and weeks blur into months - faster than the time it takes to download a song on YouTube there is no time to spend on the things I love anymore.
Are you with me
Hope you are. If you are like the rest of us, chances are you find it hard to slow down too. As Thomas Moore, author of Care of the Soul, says, We seem to have a complex about busyness in our lives. Most of us do have time in our days that we could devote to simple relaxation, but we convince ourselves that we dont. It seems there is always something that needs doing, always someone who needs our attention. Unfortunately, Moore says, we dont get a lot of support in this culture for doing nothing. If we arent accomplishing something, we feel that were wasting time.
Its not our fault I suppose that we feel compelled to measure our success in terms of acquisition and accomplishment. But even those of us who are unwilling to buy into such a narrow definition of success may feel uncomfortable with the idea of claiming time just for ourselves, with no agenda whatsoever. Often when we find we have an empty hour, we spend that time cleaning cobwebs off the ceiling or calling an aunt who lives on her own to check how she is doing. And on those rare moments when there is no one around us and we are alone at home, we all reach for the phoneor the TV remote or the pile of washed clothes waiting to be folded. As Katrina Kenison writes in her article Why you must have time alone, we avoid ourselves because we are afraid of what we might find: a forlorn, flawed someone whos missing out on lifes party. But, the good news is, says Kenison, We can retreat from the world for a time without being renounced by it.
I think children know how to do this better than us adults. Whenever I see my 8-year-old play in the garden, I marvel at her contentment and self-sufficiency. She is completely absorbed as she plants twigs in an empty flowerpot and chatters to her teddy who incidentally is named Happy. She is enjoying her own good companya trait that, somewhere along the line, so many of us seems to have lost.
More creative!
So, it is important that we force ourselves to be alone. Mostly because experts say we are more creative alone. This could be why Pulitzer prizewinning writer John Updike, author of 51 books, attributes his astonishing productivity to a schedule that honors empty time. Ideally, he explains, much of my day should be, in a strict sense, idle, for it is often in idle moments that real inspiration comes.
Being alone with ourselves also helps us see things more clearly. We live in an extremely externalized culture, Moore says. We are constantly pulled outside ourselvesby other people, by the media, by the demands of daily life. Nothing in our culture or in our education teaches us how to go inward, how to steady the mind and calm our attention. As a consequence, we tend to devote very little time to the life of the soul, the life of the spirit.
We need to balance the pace and intensity of modern life with periods of what poet May Sarton has called open time, with no obligations except toward the inner world and what is going on there. Alonein moments of prayer or meditation, or simply in stillnesswe breathe more deeply, see more fully, hear more keenly. We notice more, and in the process, we return to what is sacred.
So, if, like me, you and your inner self have been out of touch for quite some time now, build a new relationship with someone who deserves attentionyou.
Make a date with yourself. Do what novelist, poet and lecturer Julia Cameron encourages her readers to do, in her book The Right to Write, - treat yourself to a weekly artist datea solo expedition to a place that interests you. That might be a clothes store, an art or natural history museum, a movie or the beach. The point is not to accomplish something or even to learn something; its simply to have funalone. When we romance our creative consciousness, she says, we have far more energy to bring to our everyday lives.
Two is a crowd!
To do so, however, remember to stand firm. Its funny how easily time alone turns into something elsebut remember, when it comes to solitude, two is a crowd. Even if you are tempted to invite a friend to go on a walk with you, keep in mind that friends are priceless, but so is an opportunity to walk in silence through the footpaths at Diyawanna or on a quiet road near your home.
Experts also say when you are in the process of finding time for yourself it is always best to be clear about your needs. I need some time for myself sounds both desperate and vague. If you are married your spouse;s response to this timeworn refrain could easily be Yeah, so do I. Next time, be clear and practical: On Saturday afternoon, I will be gone from two oclock to five oclock. Will you be able to watch the kids
If you find time for yourself make sure you help others in their efforts to take time off too. If you claim Saturday afternoon, invite your partner to follow his or her own inclinations next time, while you hold down the fort.
Meanwhile, be on the lookout for stolen moments. There are empty spaces in almost every day, tiny nooks of time that you can inhabit in solitude, says Kenison. Try arriving ten minutes early for appointments, walking to work, working on your laptop out in the garden, making dinner without the phone pressed to one ear. Breathe deeply, be still, and check in with yourself, if only for a few minutes.
Finally, practice doing nothing. Your need to replenish and play is as important as your need to get through the to-do list. Just dont make too big a deal out of figuring out how to relax, Moore says. If you make a program of it, youre back to busyness.
Got it yet Accept it. Carving out a little solitude can make a world of difference. So go aheadgive yourself a break. Give your soul a holiday. Sit still and watch the clouds go by. After all, you wont see that particular cloud in that particular place in the sky, ever again.
Tips for making me time a reality
First, decide that you deserve some time to yourself each day. Stop feeling guilty for taking time out for you, and realize in the long run, its a win-win for everyone. When you are tired, stressed out and pulled in too many directions, it is hard to give your best to all you must accomplish. Remember, self-time is not selfishits a necessary dimension of self-care!
Decide how best to spend me time. How each of us chooses to spend free time is as individualized as we all are. If you had an extra 15 minutes, a half hour, an afternoon or an entire day, what would you do to make yourself feel rejuvenated, relaxed and happy Write a list and keep it handy when you begin scheduling time into your calendar.
Evaluate the things that are wasting your time each day. Do you check your emails constantly and end up spending more time on your computer than you planned Do you answer personal calls in the middle of your workday If this sounds like you, you must take the time to organize your responsibilities, and you will gain more free time than you can imagine.
Learn to say no to requests to do things that you dont really want to, dont value or dont bring you satisfaction and joy.
Ask for help with chores that dont necessarily have to be completed by you alone.
At the beginning of each week, take a few minutes to designate specific time slots for all that must be accomplishedincluding me time. Treat your personal time like you would any other appointment and make it non-negotiable.
Commit to a minimum of 15-20 minutes of me time every day. Do something (or nothing) that completely lets go of responsibilities and releases your mind, allowing you to be alone with your thoughts.
Create a daily ritual. This can be a bath, listening to music, taking a walk or meditating. Make it something you can look forward to.

Govts short term- ad-hoc policy  changers badly hurt auto industry
CMTA to seek FMs intervention to redress burning issues
It has once again been a troublesome period for the Auto Industry in Sri Lanka with the usual short term and ad-hoc policy changers hurting the industry very much, opined reelected Ceylon Motor Traders Association (CMTA) Chairman Reeza Rauf.
Addressing 97th CMTA AGM on Friday Rauf said that they have been constantly lobbying with the government in that regard and would continue to do so from time to time until a fair policy is implemented.
The adverse policies also have created a no level playing field in the market while certain sectors especially in the used car imports continue to benefit. It is also very unfortunate that the relevant government institutions fail to recognize our contribution to the economy, while the policies adapted and implemented are favoring only certain segments when you compare as a whole in the industry, specifically used car imports, he said.
Reeza further cautioned that the present valuation system for import of used vehicles adapted was far more detrimental to the government and the lost revenue is immense. This would be very evident if the authorities could carry out a proper investigation and analyze the market trend for the last one to, one and a half years period.It has been very unfortunate that in spite of bring this to the attention of relevant authorities, no hearing nor considerate has been given to the legitimate importers of brand new vehicles, Reeza said.
In addition to the chaotic tax policies the industry was further hurt by the restriction of credit facility of LTV, to 50% for motor cars/SUVs, 70% for motor cycles and 25% for three wheelers which dampened the demand from customers to purchase at least a low end motor vehicle through vehicle finance. It is also much regretted that the government decision to allow to import and register vehicles assembled by importing age old used spare parts contravening all safety standards and risking the lifes of the general public who were unaware of the dangers.
This was also contradicting the budget proposal of 2016 where it suggests to re-export vehicles which were five years and older, whilst these so called used parts could be well over five to 10 years, he cautioned. Reeza however said that the CMTA was very much aware of the present situation the government was faced with in bridging the gap of BOP.

However, the industry cannot suffer or close down but need to find a mechanism for sustenance of the stake holders to safe guard the industry and thousands of employees who are dependent on this industry and also not jeopardizing the future growth.It is our humble appeal to the government to heed to our plea to protect the stake holders and the Industry, the CMTA Chairman said adding that the association plans to meet Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera soon to discuss the burning issues the industry was facing today.

Ground breaking agreement inked for tallest building in Asia
The much hyped and long awaited agreement of the tallest building in the Asian Region and the 9th tallest to be in the world, the World Capital Centre (WCC) has signed its USD 2 billion Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) investment agreement with the Board of Investment (BOI) on Friday .
The World Capital Centre also known as WCC is a globally renowned chain will be the center of multiple trading and service providing establishments will be having an astonishing twin tower with modern amenities of 117 floors, gracing a height of 625 meters with an estimated total project cost of USD 2 billion to be built in the heart of Colombos commercial area.
It will include 1,200 residential units, 2,000 hotel rooms, 3,000 retail outlets, 5,000 car parking spaces, the WCC 7-star hotel, 20 swimming pools, gold presidential suites with gold-plated interiors, worlds fastest double-decker elevators and the first Michelin starred restaurant in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka being centrally located in South Asia is perfectly poised to be the launch pad for the capital center owing to all the bi-lateral trade agreements, close ties with the developing nations and the long trade history with the rest of the world.
While many International Banks have been operating in Sri Lanka for decades, the ending of the war has seen the expat community blooming together with large multinational companies looking to invest in new businesses or to open up branches. Within the region Sri Lanka is very easy to do business with and eventually has the potential to become what Dubai is to the Middle East, what London is to Europe, what Singapore is to South-East Asia or what New York is to the Americas.
WCC intends to be the first Financial Center to offer an innovative vehicle for Investment Companies to have their South Asian base here in Sri Lanka giving an extraordinary boost to the economic development of the country. This proposed building would be the tallest in Asia and the 9th in the world as accepted by the Skyscraper Center of U.S.A., and will be largest tower in the world having a total built up area of 800,000 square meters first of its kind in Sri Lanka, which would be an ultimate tribute to Sri Lanka as well as in the Asian economy, expected to be completed by end of year 2022.

His Home Diva!
Her bubbly smile is infectious. Her humanity touches hearts. Her talent for acting had brought her fame and fortune and made her the darling of the Sri Lankan silver screen. Many have dreamed of winning the hand of beautiful Indian-Sri Lankan actress Pooja Umashanker but it was Sri Lankan businessman Prashan David Vithakan who finally won her heart and hand in marriage. The couple said I Do at a low-key ceremony held on December 18, 2016.
First impression
I was actually still trying to read Pooja then. We met in my car when I picked her to up to go to the visually handicapped centre in December 2014. The first thought that ran through my mind was how big her sunglasses were! It looked like she was wearing a windscreen on her face! I was attracted to her humility and willingness to help those in need.
Most surprising thing about Pooja
After getting to know Pooja the most surprising thing I discovered about her was how compassionate she is towards people. Her willingness to give and actually do something about peoples needs is simply amazing. She embodies a positive attitude and this is generated to anything she takes up.
Favourite film she has acted in
Nope. I was not one of Poojas fans. I had watched only one of her films which was Attaghasam. It is a Tamil action masala film written and directed by Saran featuring Ajith Kumar in dual lead roles. Pooja played the female lead in it. I didnt know she lived in Sri Lanka. I didnt notice her much in that movie. It is only after I met her in person that I realised that it was her in that movie.
The proposal
We have been seeing each other for about six months by then. I knew I couldnt live my life without Pooja by my side... So I took the plunge and decided to ask for her hand in marriage. I flew to India to meet her father to ask him permission first and he said yes without batting an eyelid. Then I asked her mother the same question and I got the same reaction and response. After that I proposed to my beautiful angel at 98 Acres in Ella.
Passions and talents
Pooja loves helping those in need. She has a fire burning in her heart to continue building houses for the less fortunate. She is amazing at organising things. Anything, anywhere  she will get it done. I can continue to go on and on about her talents but you would need more pages to jot down the list Oh, and she makes the best omelettes!
Day off
If Pooja and I could have some time away from our busy schedules we would order our favourite pizza and spend the day watching movies at home.
Outings
We both love the food and service at The Fat Crab. Jaffna Crab curry with roast paan, pol sambol and dhal curry is our favourite meal. Their weekend brunch is also just amazing. I personally like the katta sambol sandwich as well.
Most memorable thing Pooja has said or done for Prashan
It is not what she said but it is how she said it and how it made me feel at that time that made it special. It was the moment when she looked at me and told me that she is in love with me...I know it sounds clich but there is a personal connection between us which said much, much, much more than just I love you. She said that on September 22, 2015.
Most romantic gesture
I am the one who wears the romance hat in this marriage. Pooja isnt a big fan of surprises as well.
Pooja sans the glitz and glamour
Shes my Home Diva! Basically what you see is exactly what you get with Pooja and I love that about her. She is the same personality you guys see in public when she is at home. There isnt the slightest change.
One change
One thing I would like to change about Pooja She asked me the same question in 2015. My answer was her address! I meant that we should live in one house together.
Alternative profession
If she did not become an actress Pooja would have made an excellent lawyer because she takes time to gather all the facts before putting her argument across to you. I would say 99 percent of the time she will win the case.
Fans
Pooja is thronged by fans wherever she goes. That is inevitable and it was a bit difficult to get used to at the beginning because it was invading our privacy. We found it difficult to travel to hotels in and around Sri Lanka without people constantly hounding her for selfies. There are times where I need to take a stand and say no. This is simply because some people fail to understand that we go to a holiday destination to get away from the hustle and bustle. Most of the time we go to supermarkets just before they close because we want to avoid people following us to take photos!
I guess it is something I need to deal with progressively and I am hoping that people would try to understand...
Most memorable moment together
One of the most memorable moments of our time together was when I took her to Ella to propose to her. I was so nervous and I knew she doesnt like surprises. So I had to tread very carefully. Eventually, when I gathered my courage to go down on one knee to propose to her, she actually tried to pick me up, thinking that I had tripped and fallen on the floor! That was a moment of happiness, relief and sheer embarrassment
Life with Pooja in a few words
Stress free  It is easy to live with someone who has characteristics that are similar to yours. She knows about my likes and dislikes and I know all about her favourite and least favourite things.
Fun - We fill our days with life and laughter. I dislike being serious all the time.
Prioritizing - She always puts my life before hers and I do the same. We live for each other.
God - Last but not least, we keep God as the centre of our marriage. We both love God beyond measure and that too keeps our flame burning bright.
Upcoming plans
I guess you are hinting about us having kids. Well, not at the moment. We are currently focusing on our marriage, travelling and spending time with each other every opportunity we get.

Horn stuns Pacquiao to win WBO welterweight crown
BRISBANE AFP July2, 2017:Former schoolteacher Jeff Horn stunned world champion Manny Pacquiao to win the World Boxing Organisation welterweight crown with a unanimous points decision in Brisbane on Sunday.
Given no chance by most observers, the 29-year-old Horns ultra-aggressive style proved too much for Pacquiao, with the three judges scoring the fight 117-111, 115-113 and 115-113 to the Australian after 12 rounds.
Pacquiao, 38, is an eight-weight world champion considered one of the greatest fighters of his generation. His camp had predicted a short and sweet win over Horn, a 2012 Australian Olympian. But Horn showed no signs of being overawed by the occasion, taking the fight to the Filipino great from the opening bell.
He moved forward relentlessly, not allowing Pacquiao time to find any rhythm.
I feel like he couldnt get a hold of my gap. I was feinting a lot, trying to upset his rhythm and I think that was working throughout the majority of that fight, said Horn, who stands three-and-a-half inches (9cm) taller than Pacquiao.
Pacquiao did manage to land some left jabs in the opening rounds to take the early points, but Horn refused to back away and his brawling tactics paid dividends through the middle stages. He was quick when he put combinations together but I felt controlling the gap made it easier to see the punches coming, Horn said.
The size difference helped too. Pacquiao, bleeding profusely from cuts high above both eyes caused by accidental head clashes, launched a savage counterattack in the ninth round and appeared to have Horn in trouble with some massive blows that left the Australian staggering.
The ref came over (at the end of the round) and said show me something or Ill stop the fight, Horn said. I thought, hang on, hold your horses, Im not that bad, I can keep going for sure. Horn recovered and came out strongly in the 10th. That was just my heart that kept me going, he said.
He got me with a couple of good shots and I did go backwards more in that round than in any other round in the fight, but I still felt good.
But I came back in the 10th11th and 12th. Both fighters began to tire in the final stages of a contest fought at a relentless pace, but Horns early lead proved too much to peg back as he claimed the biggest win of his career. Pacquiao had been hoping to set up a second big-money showdown with Floyd Mayweather, but it was Horn who called for a fight with the unbeaten American immediately after his win.
Pacquiao did not talk to the media after the fight, claiming he needed treatment on his head wounds.

How to plant and grow Zinnias
Zinnias are very easy to grow from seed, which makes them a very economical choice in the garden. Plant seeds outdoors after the last frost in spring, or get a head start by starting the seeds indoors in late winter. Follow these planting and growing tips for zinnias:
* Choose a spot with full sun and rich, well-drain ing soil for zinnias, thats easily accessible with a garden hose. Although zinnias are drought- tolerant, its best if you can keep the seedlings moist until theyre established.
* Till or loosen the top 6 to 12 of soil and mix in plenty of compost. Zinnias tolerate most any type of soil (as long as it isnt soggy), but the richer the soil, the better the flowers!
* Plant zinnia seeds according to package instructions. Spacing depends on the variety  smaller zinnias are usually planted about 6 apart while the giant types should be spaced every 12 apart.
* Zinnia seeds will germinate pretty quickly, and the plants should bloom in about 2 months.
* Keep zinnia plants regularly watered, but not soaked.
* Feed zinnia plants about once a month with a balanced organic fertilizer.
* Keep leggy stems on zinnias pinched back. Dont prune too heavily, or the plants wont have time to recover. However, feel free to cut fresh flowers to bring indoors  theyll keep blooming!

Lanka to become largest value added tea exporter
At this juncture when Sri Lanka has become the third or fourth largest tea exporter in the world, the Governments ultimate target is to develop this 150- year old traditional industry to the maximum and be the largest value added tea exporter one day, Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne said.
Minister Wickramaratne made these remarks at the 123rd AGM of the Colombo Tea Traders Association (CTTA) held in Colombo. Sri Lanka Tea Board Chairman Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda, CTTA Chairman Anselm Perera and Plantation Industry Ministry Secretary R.A. Ranjith were also present.
Speaking further Minister Wickramaratne said Ceylon tea is still best in the world and said tea still remains the countrys main export and the industry contribute immensely to swell the countrys economy.
He said this industry not only support to uplift the economy but also help in terms of generating employment and therefore it is also the duty of the Government to extend its co-operation towards the industry by supporting tea growers , traders, exporters and all others involved.The Minister also valued the invaluable service rendered by Colombo Tea Traders Association to protect this industry .
Ceylon Tea Traders Association, Chairman Anselm Perera highlighted several issues faced by the tea industry and said a significant drop in the countrys tea production has recorded due to erratic weather conditions, long droughts, torrential rains, floods and landslides.
He said as a result, the countrys tea production recorded a sharp decline and the statistics have revealed that the current tea production fell to a very low 292 million killogramms which is the lowest volume since 2009.
Another contributory factor to this low volume of production was the banning of the main weedicides ,used by tea producers,.
He said the authorities banned it without any planning or warning and as a result it badly impaired productivity and increased the cost.
Chairman Perera resorting to manual weeding and said it is not a solution as manual weeding is intensive and expensive. It also get the soil erosion and degradation. Even the labour availability has dwindled down to 140,000 from 400,000 due to various reasons.
He also highly disappointed over certain remarks made by state authorities as well as the Chairman of Sri Lanka Tea Board over the using of weedicide and said leaders should take responsibility for such irrational decisions as weedicide is effectively used in Western countries to get high yield.
The Chairman said  2014 was our best year with a record income of US dollars 1.6 billion and it gradually reduced to 1.34 and 1.25 in 2015 and 2016 due to the dropping of both prices and the crop, but we managed to tide through these difficult times by selling tea below the cost of production.
Chairman Perera finally requested the Government to intervene in their problems and remove all non-tariff barriers placed on them.
Sri Lanka Tea Board Chairman Rohan Pethiyagoda said Sri Lanka Tea Board is a large state institution with some 300 employees and it has almost six billion rupees in the bank and they have now been trying to launch a Global Promotion Campaign.
He also claimed that the tea industry is being paralysed by the Tea Board, which is the industrys central institution, being strangled by red tape.

Letter from Greenwich Village
For nearly twenty years now Leonard and I have met once a week for a walk, dinner, and a movie, either in his neighborhood or mine. Except for the two hours in the movie, we hardly ever do anything else but talk. One of us is always saying, Lets get tickets for a play, a concert, a reading, but neither of us ever seems able to arrange an evening in advance of the time we are to meet. The fact is, ours is the most satisfying conversation either of us has, and we cant bear to give it up even for one week.
Why then, one might ask, do we not meet more often than once a week The problem is, we both have a penchant for the negative. Whatever the circumstance, for each of us the glass is perpetually half-empty. Either he is registering loss, failure, defeator I am. We cannot help ourselves.
Debating skills
One night at a party I fell into a disagreement with a friend of ours who is famous for his debating skills. At first, I responded nervously to his every challenge, but soon I found my sea legs and then I stood my ground more successfully than he did. People crowded round me. That was wonderful, they said, wonderful. I turned eagerly to Leonard. You were nervous, he said.
Another time, I went to Florence with my niece. How was it Leonard asked. The city was lovely, I said, my niece is great. You know, its hard to be with someone twenty-four hours a day for eight days, but we traveled well together, walked miles along the Arno, that river is beautiful. That is sad, Leonard said. That you found it irritating to be so much with your niece.
A third time, I went to the beach for the weekend. It rained one day, was sunny another. Again, Leonard asked how it had been. Refreshing, I said. The rain didnt daunt you, he said.
I remind myself of what my voice can sound like. My voice, forever edged in judgment, that also never stops registering the flaw, the absence, the incompleteness. My voice that so often causes Leonards eyes to flicker and his mouth to tighten.
At the end of an evening together one or the other of us will impulsively suggest that we meet again during the week, but only rarely does the impulse live long enough to be acted upon. We mean it, of course, when we are saying good-byewant nothing more than to renew the contact immediatelybut going up in the elevator to my apartment, I start to feel on my skin the sensory effect of an eveningful of irony and negative judgment. Nothing serious, just surface damagea thousand tiny pinpricks dotting arms, neck, chestbut somewhere within me, in a place I cannot even name, I begin to shrink from the prospect of feeling it again soon.
Failed nerve
A day passes. Then another. I must call Leonard, I say to myself, but repeatedly the hand about to reach for the phone fails to move. He, of course, must be feeling the same, as he doesnt call either. The unacted-upon impulse accumulates into a failure of nerve. Failure of nerve hardens into ennui. When the cycle of mixed feeling, failed nerve, and paralyzed will has run its course, the longing to meet again acquires urgency, and the hand reaching for the phone will complete the action. Leonard and I consider ourselves intimates because our cycle takes only a week to complete.

Medical Devices  Industry workshop  on procurement guidelines
Members and stakeholders involved with the Sri Lanka Chamber of Medical Devices Industry gathered recently for a workshop on National Procurement Guidelines and the Impact on Pharmaceuticals and the Medical Devices Industry, at the Grand Oriental Hotel.
This workshop was conducted in coordination with the Ministry of Finance and was graced with the presence of members of the Ministry of Health, State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC), Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and Biomedical Engineering Division along with other industry partners.
Speaking at the workshop, Saman Hulangamuwa, President of the Sri Lanka Chamber of Medical Devices Industry, said, In today's day and age communication happens so quickly and as an industry which is highly competitive, it is imperative for us to stay ahead of the game. We need to make sure everything is in order and technology makes it so much easier. This is why we are recommending that national procurement also goes digital.
P. Algama, Director General of Public Finance from the Ministry of Finance, explained the purpose of the workshop and the importance of having an understanding of proper procurement planning to prevent high cost and ensure standard products are released to the market.
Public procurement is a key economic activity of the Government. It remains a significant part of the Sri Lanka economy, in 2016, accounting for about Rs. 596 billion or 19% of total Government spending and 5 % of GDP disbursed through public procurement process.
Procurement guidelines are essential to ensure corruption free business dealings and promote accountability and transparency.

Meet the worlds ugliest dog
Martha is big, ugly, lazy and gassy. And a world champion.
In a competition annually dominated by the old, the tiny, and the hairless, the 3-year-old, 125-pound Neapolitan Mastiff used her lollygagging youth to win the 29th annual Worlds Ugliest Dog Contest.
She was a favorite of the Northern California crowd from the start, often plopping down on her side on stage with her droopy face spread across the ground when she was supposed to be showing off. The judges didnt even need to hear her signature snore to give her the award.
Do you know you just won the Worlds Ugliest Dog Contest asked Kerry Sanders of NBC News, one of three judges who gave Martha the crown. Her handler Shirley Zindler answered for her: Id gloat, but I need a nap.
Martha lumbered away with $1,500, a flashy trophy and a trip to New York for media appearances, all things she could hardly care less about. The dog, from nearby Sebastopol, was rescued when she was nearly blind from neglect by the Dogwood Animal Rescue Project in Sonoma County, where the contest was held. After several surgeries, she can now see again, Zindler said.
The only animal in this years contest too big to be held by her handler, Martha beat out 13 other dogs, most of them the kind of older, smaller dogs who win here.
Moe, a 16-year-old Brussels Griffon-pug mix from Santa Rosa, California, who was the oldest in the competition, came in second. He had lost his hearing and sight but his sense of smell is strong and he was enjoying all the smells at the Sonoma-Marin Fair where the contest is held, including funnel cakes and other fried goodies.
Chase, a 14-year-old Chinese Crested-Harke mix, came all the way from Neath, United Kingdom to take third place.
The contestants were judged on first impressions, unusual attributes, personality and audience reaction. Many of the contestants were adopted. Monkey, a 6-year-old Brussels Griffon, and Icky, an 8-year-old unknown breed, were both rescued from the homes of hoarders.
These dogs - some with acne, others with tongues permanently sticking out - are used to getting called ugly. But for their owners, it was love at first sight. Hes my sexy boy, Vicky Adler, of Davis, California, said of her 8-year-old Chinese Crested named Zoomer.

Ministerial subcommittee members to visit Uma Oya site today
The ministerial subcommittee appointed by the Cabinet to review the Uma Oya multi-purpose project plan will conduct inspections at the project site as well as hold discussions with the people affected by the project, starting today, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, a member of the committee said. He further said the subcommittee is to submit a report based on its findings to President Maithripala Sirisena shortly.
In addition to Amaraweera, the subcommittee includes Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka and Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa.
The committee will inspect the project site in the morning. Then we shall have a round of discussions with the people affected by it. If a possibility arises to give solutions to some of the issues faced b the people, we shall do so immediately. Minister Amaraweera said.
Minister Amaraweera further said responsible officers of the relevant government bodies will also join the inspection.
Meanwhile, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka speaking at a ceremony held to hand over a Public Entertainment Center constructed by the Urban Development Authority in Kubichchikulam said, it is President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who have to bare the burden of ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksas narrow-minded decision making.
It is but natural to face such environmental hazards when large scale development projects are implemented. When the Bowathenna Tunnel was built and the Kotmale and Samanala Wewa projects initiated, it was the same case scenario. But, the Uma Oya project is a result of imprudent decision making. Minister Ranawaka said.
The water from the Uma Oya flowed into Mahaweli River which distributes it to the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa areas. Rajapaksa wanted to divert this water to Medamulana and Hambantota, Minister Ranawaka said.
He did not take any warning into consideration. He gave the project to Iran, four times larger than the project is actually worth. The technology used for the project is unsuitable,the Minister alleged Minister Ranawaka also said, around eight thousand families in Bandarawela were put at grave risk by the Uma Oya project.
He also said the demonstrations against the present government holding it responsible for the Uma Oya project is completely politically motivated.

Ministry not entrusted with garbage disposal task: Patali
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said his ministry has not been entrusted with any responsibility relating to the disposal of garbage in the country.
Referring to certain media reports which said that his ministry should undertake the systematic disposal and recycling of waste, Ranawaka said that no such responsibility had been entrusted with his ministry so far.
Ranawaka in a press release said however after the Meethotamulla tragedy, the recycling or the rehabilitation of the Meethotamulla garbage hill had been entrusted to his ministry and this work was now progressing successfully. Moreover,the unsystematic disposal of garbage was taking place without permission or approval on state land coming under the Urban and Land Reclamation and Development Cooperation, legal action would be taken against the relevant parties after identifying such lands.
The land in Muturajawela where garbage was being dumped is a private land which did not belong to the Ministry of Lands or any of its affiliated institutions as reported in certain sections of the media.
The President had entrusted Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya with the responsibility of disposing and recycling waste in the Western Province.

With the most powerful weapon
Education is a human right. It is the duty of the State to ensure that every child gets a sound education that is necessary to lead a good life. Whether it is funded by the State or not it is the responsibility of the State to ensure this right.
Historically speaking, education was a prerogative of the rich or the rulers in early stages of human society. It is only with the development of productive forces and with the blessings of religions, that education began to spread wider. Kannangara education reforms in modern times have been towards that direction. Although our country is approaching the 70th anniversary of Independence, we have failed to formulate a national education policy.
International Legal Regime on Human Right to Education.
Economic and social rights are found as part and parcel in many international instruments, universal and regional.
Among the universal instruments adopted by the United Nations are the following: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) (1948), International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) (1966), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), and UNESCO Convention on Education.
The right to education is recognised in Article 26 of the UDHR. This Article contains three paragraphs. In terms of Article 26 (1), everyone has the right to education which shall be free at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Article 26 (1) also provides that technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit. Article 26 (2) of the UDHR prescribes the standards and objects for the content of education.
Firstly, education should reflect the development of the human personality and stresses the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Secondly, it should promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations racial or religious groups.
Thirdly, education should further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace. In terms of Article 26 (3), the UDHR recognises the parents prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.
Definition of the Right to Education
Another important United Nations Covenant where education is also included in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In terms of Article 13 of the ICESCR, there are four essential features of the right to education. Paragraph 6 of the General Comment issued by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights set up under the United Nations, outlines four essential features of the right to education.
They are:
(a). Availability  Institutions and programmes must be available in sufficient quantity. All institutions will require buildings, sanitations, safe drinking water, trained teachers with domestically competitive salaries and teaching materials. Other elements may be required depending on the developmental context.
(b). Accessibility  This incorporates three main aspects: (i) non- discrimination (ii) physical accessibility/proximity and (iii) economic accessibility (which is defined in relation to each category of education.
(c). Acceptability  Form and substance, including curricula and teaching methods, must be acceptable to students in appropriate cases, parents. Given examples of acceptable include (i) relevant, (ii) culturally appropriate and (iii) good quality. This is subject to the educational objectives set forth in Article 13(1).
(d). Adaptability - It must adapt to the changing needs of society and students and be capable of reflecting the diverse social and cultural settings.
Above elements should be present in all forms of education that are discussed under the Covenant. They are sometimes referred to as the four As.
Article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Right (ICESCR), to which Sri Lanka is a party defines the right to education in great detail:
1. The State Parties to the present Covenant recognise the right of everyone to education. They agree that education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity and shall strengthen the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. They further agree that education shall enable all persons to participate effectively in a free society, promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all national and all racial, ethnic or religious groups and further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace.
2. The State parties to the present Covenant recognise that with a view to achieving the full realisation of this right:
a. Primary education shall be compulsory and available free to all.
b. Secondary education in its different forms, including technical and vocational secondary education, shall be made generally available and accessible to all by every appropriate means, in particular by the progressive introduction of free education.
c. Higher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education.
d. Fundamental education shall be encouraged or intensified as far as possible for those persons who have not received or completed the whole period of their primary education.
e. The development of a system of schools at all levels shall be actively pursued, an adequate fellowship system shall be established and the material conduction of teaching staff shall be continuously improved.
3. The State Parties to the present Covenant undertake to have respect for the delivery of parents and when applicable, legal guardians for their children's schools, other than those established by the public authorities, which conform to such minimum educational standards as may be laid down or approved by the State and to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions.
4. No part of this Article shall be construed so as to interfere with the liberty of individuals or bodies to establish and direct educational institutions, subject always to the observance of the principles set forth in paragraph 1 of this Article and to the requirement that the education given in such institutions shall conform to such minimum standards as may be laid down by the State.
The right to Educational Freedom
As noted by Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the right to education may only be properly fulfilled when both teachers and students enjoy academic freedom.
Also on the basis of that experience, the Committee noted that higher education is particularly susceptible to political and other pressures which undermine academic freedom.
This freedom requires the institutional autonomy of higher educational institutions. A balance must, therefore, be struck between institutional autonomy and accountability to public needs as required by State set standards.
Articles 13(3) and (4) deal with the right to educational freedom. This has been further explained by General Comment No.13, paras 28-30. These Articles are concerned with the right to establish educational institutions outside those provided by the State. They are principally concerned with ensuring educational plurality, and with preserving educational institutions that conform with parents beliefs, particularly . to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions. In practice, this would include methods such as homeschooling, Montessori schools, denominational schools and others. This freedom must be considered in tandem with the minimal educational standards established by the State. The Committee clarifies that . these minimum standards may relate to issues such as admission, curricula and the recognition of certificates.
This condition on the exercise of this right must be read in light of the purpose of these articles, for if the State were capable of exercising unrestrained control over these factors, it could effectively eliminate the option of non-state schools. It is submitted that the State should regulate core standards in such subjects, ensure non-discrimination and non-violence within school systems and ensure curricular conforms with the educational objectives in Article 13 (i) of the ICESCR.
The Right to Higher Education
The right to higher education is found in Article 13(2)( c). General Comment No.13 paras 17-20 also deal with that right. The principal difference between the right to higher education and the other forms is that access to it is to be made on the basis of individual capacity. At paragraph 19, the committee writes that  capacity should be assessed by reference to all their relevant expertise and experience. It is clear that the Committee declares as violations any restrictions that are unrelated to capacity, such as gender, physical disability, etc. On the other, the Committee seems to imply that academic performance alone should not be the only criteria for determining the capacity of potential students.
The nature of State obligations
Article 2(1) of the ICESCR is the key to ICESCR. It sets forth the kinds of obligations the State parties undertake when they ratify the Covenant. It identifies the steps the government must make in order to realise each substantive rights.
Article 2.1 provides for the binding nature of the ICESCR rights:
Each State party to the Covenant undertakes to take steps individually and through international assistance and corporation and especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources with a view to achieving progressively the realisation of the rights recognised in the present Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures.
The Committee on ESC Rights identifies the following specific obligations to Article 13 as a whole.
1. To adopt a national educational strategy.
2. To adopt a fellowship programme
3. To establish minimum educational standards and an effective monitoring system
4. To ensure that communities are not dependent on child labour
5. To ensure that all international negotiations (regarding trade, loan etc) do not adversely impact the right to education
6. To ensure access to public educational institutions without discrimination
7. To ensure education conforms to the objectives in Article 13(1)
8. To provide primary education for all
9. To ensure free choice in education.
UNESCO Convention and Rights of the Child Convention
The General Conference of the UNESCO unanimously adopted the Convention on Discrimination in Education and a Recommendation in 1960.
This Convention which is comparatively short and simple contains undertakings to eliminate and prevent discrimination in education based on race, sex, language, religion and other grounds.
Article 2 of the Convention allowed for situations which when permitted in a State should not be deemed to constitute discrimination. Thus, the establishment and maintenance of separate but equal educational systems for the two sexes were permitted provided that there really was equivalent access and equally well-qualified staff and the same or equivalent courses of study.
The Convention on the Rights of the child adopted in 1989 by the United Nations by Article 28 recognises the right of the child to education. It requires, primary education for them compulsory and available free to all, to make available secondary education, to make available higher education to all of them on the basis of capacity by every appropriate means, measures to reduce drop-out rates.
The principle of free education  or even the progressive attainment of free education  fails when the vast majority are denied higher education. The right to education coupled with the right to equal treatment also requires the State to take affirmative action to reduce disparities in education facilities.
The UGC introduced the quota system, recognising under- privileged districts, claiming that it was a temporary solution pending the elimination of those disparities. Nearly three decades later, disparities appear to continue in the educational sector in the country, due to spatial socio economic disparities.
However, it is urged to submit quota system to comprehensive review soon.

OBrien cited for red card hit
WELLINGTON: British and Irish Lions flanker Sean OBrien will join All Black Sonny Bill Williams before a judiciary panel on Sunday after being cited for allegedly striking Waisake Naholo during the second Test in Wellington.
OBrien and Williams are both expected to miss the third and deciding Test in Auckland next week if found guilty.
OBriens swinging arm that floored Naholo midway through the second half met the threshold for a red card, the citing commissioner said in a decision released several hours after Saturdays Test won 24-21 by the Lions.
Williams, who was sent off in the first half following a shoulder charge to the head of Lions wing Anthony Watson, and OBrien will appear separately before an all-Australian judiciary panel on Sunday evening.
Naholo left the field after he was hit in the jaw, but All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said he showed no ill-effects the next morning.
Hansen confirmed Williams would not contest his red card and a suspension would rule him out of the third Test.
Theres a (judicial) process, we trust the process. Sonnys paid a big price. The teams paid a big price for him making a mistake, Hansen said.  AFP

OMI present scholarships to undergraduates
Those who get selected to continue their higher studies at a university level are a privileged lot over many others. Though many are qualified to enter university, owing to restrictions such as the lack of space to accommodate and provide other facilities, only a selected lot get the opportunity enter universities.
Hence, those who are privileged to enter universities and receive the 'De Mazenod Scholarships' are requested to concentrate on their studies and not to waste precious time for other things, said Rev. Fr. Dennis Iddamalgoda, OMIthe man behind the De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation. Addressing the recipients of the 'De Mazenod Scholarship,' at the ceremony held at the Centre for Society and Religion(CSR), Maradana, on June 24, Fr. Iddamalgoda said that money to grant scholarships to the most deserving poor students selected for university studies are provided with hard-earned money, working overseas.
The scholarships are given not to play and waste money and time, but to come out one day with success, to be useful and responsible citizens of Sri Lanka.
Fr. Dennis went on to say the Foundation selected undergraduates purely on merit, irrespective of their religion or ethnicity. He added that the target of the De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation is to provide scholarships to 100 students.
Rev. Frs. Justin Silva, Angelo Wijewickrema and Ajith Wellington, also addressed the ceremony.

Operation of LG bodies postponed for three months
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha issuing an Extra ordinary Gazette on Friday has postponed the operation of Local Government bodies for a further period of three months.
The Government on April 7 gazetted the number of members in each local government body, the number of members to be elected from Proportional Representation (PR) system and the number of female representatives in each of them as per the new electoral system. This was done after the onerous task of delimitation which dragged on for months due to errors made in the initial report of the delimitation committee.
The order made on April 7 was to come into operation from July 1. However, as the Local Government Elections have been delayed, the Ministry has issued another Extra Ordinary Gazette last Friday postponing the order till October 1.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry Secretary Kamal Padmasiri said the Order would have to be extended again if LG elections were not conducted by October 1.
The period of 335 Local Government bodies (23 Municipal Councils, 41 Urban Councils and 271 Pradeshiya Sabhas) has expired and they have been placed under special commissioners until the long overdue elections are held.

Oxford Dictionarys new last word
Eating a tasty meal with chana dal or doenjang washed down with a gin daisy could well foster a nice feeling of hygge. Just hope you dont find any zyzzyva on your plate.
If you need to look up any of those words, the unofficial custodian of the English language now has the answers. In its latest update, the Oxford English Dictionary identified more than 600 words, phrases and senses that have entered common parlance.
They include zyzzyva, a genus of tropical weevils native to South America. The word replaces zythum -- an ancient Egyptian malt beer - as the OEDs final entry. The name was apparently coined by the US entomologist Thomas Lincoln Casey, who described it in a 1922 work, the OED said. In any case, zyzzyva owes much of its currency in English to its notoriety as the last entry in various dictionaries, the ranks of which now include the OED, it said.
The quarterly update includes post-truth, previously announced by the OED as its word of the year for 2016 following Britains Brexit referendum and Donald Trumps presidential victory. Brexit itself also made into the dictionary last year, meeting the OEDs criterion that a new word, phrase or sense of a word must have featured in a variety of printed sources over several years.
Other new senses this time include thing, as in a genuine or established phenomenon or practice, often used when youre incredulous about something. The OED said the earliest citation of this new sense was from a 2000 episode of the US TV drama The West Wing: Did you know that leaf peeping was a thing
Just in time for this years Wimbledon tournament are 50 new terms relating to tennis, such as forced error, chip and charge and career slam. Further additions to the English lexicon are chana dal, the Hindi phrase for chickpeas, and doenjang, a paste made from fermented soya beans used in Korean cookery.
A gin daisy is a cocktail made with gin, lemon juice and (usually) grenadine. Drink enough gin daisies and you may well be overcome by hygge, the Danish term for a quality of coziness and comfortable conviviality that engenders a feeling of contentment or well-being.

Power from Nature
Most of the world runs on oil or fossil fuels, but there is a catch - oil is a finite resource that could run dry before 2100 at the present rates of consumption. Oil and its related products such as coal and gas will certainly reach the end of the line sooner rather than later, even within the lifetime of the younger generations among us.
Despite having an abundance of hydropower resources, Sri Lanka relies heavily on thermal sources that meet over 70 per cent of the country's energy needs, thanks to the vagaries of weather and rainfall. This is clearly untenable in the long run, because we are a net importer of fossil fuels. With an oil import bill of US$ 6 billion (and rising), we need to find alternatives fast. Yes, we might strike gas and oil, but commercial exploitation is still decades away.
Our world is blessed with energy sources that are virtually infinite  solar and wind are the biggest two. Every day, the sun shines bright enough to power our world several times over for years on end, but we have not yet developed the technology to harness this energy properly. The same goes for wind power.
Sri Lanka, being a tropical country, is ideally positioned to take advantage of both these sources of renewable energy. While there had been half-hearted attempts to use more solar and wind energy for several decades, this Government has made it a matter of policy. The Government is committed towards adding more solar and wind energy to the national grid, and has promised to make the national grid a smart grid in another five years time, says Ajith Perera, Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy. According to the Minister, Sri Lanka is to call tenders to purchase 875 Megawatts of power shortly, most of which is expected to come from renewables.
The Government has already started a Soorya Bala Sangramaya (Battle for Solar Power) an initiative that President Maithripala Sirisena launched last year to add 220 MW of solar power to the grid by 2020. The programme is already in full swing, where commercial establishments, factories, homes and even places of worship (Abhayaramaya in Colombo is the latest place of worship to install solar power panels) are encouraged to opt for solar power. Any excess power generated can be channelled back to the National Grid.
The Government has now started the Green Energy 2017 Champion Campaign, in collaboration with the German Federal Foreign Office and project implementing partner Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH. The Power and Energy Ministry and the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority will coordinate.
Germany is the ideal partner for a programme of this nature, being one of the few countries where more than 30 percent of the power requirement is already derived from renewable energy. Germany is planning to reach 50 percent renewable power in due course. We can learn a lot from Germany about renewable energy, which has the added benefit of being non-polluting.
However, in order to add more solar and wind energy to the national grid, it is necessary to have more storage capacity. Nevertheless, experts have estimated that even without advanced storage capacities, the country can add more than 500 Megawatts from solar energy. The Government plans to add extra capacity during the next 18 months.
The Government will invest in the infrastructure, but will not invest in power generation per se, which has been left to the private sector. The response to this drive is very promising. All possible concessions must be granted for the manufacture, import and installation of solar power systems which have come a long way since the first solar cells appeared in calculators.
The best sites in Sri Lanka for both solar and wind projects must be identified without delay, especially in the light of the Government saying no to the proposed Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) power projects in Sampur. This is a shortfall of 500 MW. It can be bridged with the right combination of solar and wind power. Sri Lanka and India plan to coordinate on a 50 MW solar power plant at this site.
Such international cooperation is indeed vital to develop the local energy sector. Even more importantly, there should be a political consensus as well. As Jorn Rohde, German Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives, stated at the Green Champions ceremony, political consensus is crucial for implementing and persisting with renewal energy initiatives to meet targets in the energy sector of Sri Lanka.
If a future Government reneges on renewable energy and climate control pledges, all the present efforts would come to naught. This should not happen  hence the importance of having a bipartisan approach. In fact, energy should be recognized as a core policy, along with education, health, defence and foreign affairs that would not necessarily change when the Government changes. Sri Lanka is one of the few developing countries with 100 percent electricity penetration and a 24/7 power supply and we should aim to be in the forefront of the new energy equation.

Record-breaking Hales smashes Notts to One-Day Cup glory
LONDON, Saturday  Alex Hales smashed the record for the highest score in an English county final with a sensational unbeaten 187 to lead Nottinghamshire to a four-wicket win over Surrey and lift the One-Day Cup at Lords.
Surrey had given themselves a chance after winning the toss and choosing to bat, posting 297 for nine in their 50 overs, inspired by an unbeaten 144 for opener Mark Stoneman. But Stoneman was outshone by Hales as he faced 167 balls and smashed 20 fours and four sixes on the way to breaking Geoffrey Boycotts 1965 county final record of 146. That allowed Nottinghamshire to reach their target with four wickets and just over two overs to spare. Combining technical precision with brazen power-hitting, Hales secured his century in just 83 balls with Nottinghamshire 134 for four. He was then ably assisted by captain Chris Read, who scored 58 batting at seven to help Notts over the line in what was probably his last outing at Lords as he prepares to retire.
It was absolutely phenomenal. What we witnessed today was very, very special, said Read of Hales performance.
Neither Hales nor Stoneman were included in the England squad announced on Saturday for the upcoming first Test against South Africa, but each sent a timely message to Joe Root and the selectors.
Both could have been removed early after Hales was dropped by Ollie Pope on nine and Stoneman by Steven Mullaney on 32, but it was the formers awesome display, eclipsing his previous career-best of 171 for England last year, that inspired Nottinghamshire to reach their 298 target. One man who was included in the England squad was Stuart Broad, and the fast bowler was passed fit to play for Notts after a heel problem, although he finished with figures of 0-51. Team-mate Samit Patel was the leading performer with the ball, taking 3-51. Surrey, for whom Kumar Sangakkara was their second-top scorer with 30, have now lost three successive finals in this competition after defeats to Gloucestershire in 2015 and Warwickshire last year.
Scores:
Surrey 297-9, 50 overs (MD Stoneman 144 no; KC Sangakkara 30, SR Patel 3-51)
Nottinghamshire 298-6, 47.5 overs (AD Hales 187 n.o., CMW Read 58; SM Curran 3-68)

Report on impact of potential ban  of chrysotile fibre in SL launched
The Chrysotile Information Centre of Sri Lanka held a seminar recently in Colombo to launch a publication on theSocio Economic Impact of the Potential Prohibition of Chrysotile in Sri Lanka. The publication was based on a comprehensive research-driven study carried out by its Research Intelligence Unit (RIU).
RIU Director Roshan Madawala said, Todays report adds a fundamental enhancement on our knowledge about the safe use of chrysotile in Sri Lanka. Our study shows that an attempt to ban the fibre will have severe macroeconomic consequences, and at the individual level be felt most urgently by low-income and other rural communities at risk who rely on chrysotile fibre-based roofing.
The programme consisted of a presentation followed by a panel discussion by experts who spoke on the potentially grave impacts of a ban of chrysotile fibre cement roofing products on Sri Lankas economy. Several dignitaries including Minister Susil Premajayantha, Minister Eran Wickramarathne and others graced the occasion.
The Director of the Chrysotile Information Centre and co-sponsor of the study, Sunil Amawarwansa said: Its essential to note that chrysotile has been used safely in Sri Lanka for more than 50 years  proving that safe use is a reality. This stands in distinction to other forms of asbestos.
The facts show that the ban of chrysotile would cause economic losses, especially to the Government, with an estimated Rs. 1.653 trillion (US$ 11.25 billion) of unnecessary increase in economic burden on households in the entire country derived from removal, transportation and disposal of the existing chrysotile roofing.
Almost two million houses and buildings with chrysotile roofing materials need to be removed and pay for higher costs of substitute products, if chrysotile were to be banned.
The research report further explains that the impact on different groups of consumers include households, the business sector and the government sector as represented solely by the impact on the hospitals and schools. Over 43,000 hospital beds and 2,368 schools have been using chrysotile roofs. Thereby more than millions of people and children across the island will be affected by the potential ban.
Social effects were mostly connected to unemployment, leading to job reduction of up to 4,500  in a short time. Unfortunately, closure of plants will further increase unemployment up to 250,000. The loss of income to direct and indirect employees in the industry will be US$122 million per year.
Clay tiles are in the frontline amongst alternatives proposed to substitute chrysotile roofing. However, the biggest drawback is the inability to increase production of clay tiles, as it requires increasing excavation of earth substantially. This would cause serious negative impacts on the environment such as landslides.
A case in point is the impact that a potential ban on chrysotile fibre imports may have on Sri Lanka's trade relations with Russia, the worlds biggest supplier of chrysotile fibre. The imports are currently valued at over US$ 426 million with the balance of trade in Sri Lanka's favour.
Since 1955, Sri Lanka has used locally produced chrysotile roofing material for home and commercial use. No specific studies, conducted internationally or locally so far, have shown disease being caused by chrysotile.
Roshan Madawela, CEO of RIU hands over the report titled 'Socio Economic Impact of the Potential Prohibition of Chrysotile in Sri Lanka' to MInister of Science, Technology and Research Susil Premajayantha. Sunil Amarawansa, Director of Chrysotile Information Centre is also present
This research study has shown that chrysotile fibre cement is a preferred choice of roofing material especially amongst Sri Lankas low and mid-income populations.
A potential ban on chrysotile poses adverse impacts on the national economy, even affecting householders affordability and quality of living conditions.
Therefore, through the release and dissemination of Socio-Economic Impact of the Potential Prohibition of Chrysotile in Sri Lanka report, the Chrysotile Information Centre aims to provide invaluable references and guidance to key decisionmakers, authorities and stakeholders towards making favourable decisions to support the countrys economy, while maintaining conducive environment for international trade relations.
Asbestos is a commercial term, referring to two families of different, but naturally occurring fibre silicates, which are characterised by extraordinary heat resistance and strength. The generic term 'asbestos is an often mistaken as a single form of the mineral  when in fact the differences in form could not be more important. The form of asbestos that is associated most closely with human health problems is the amphibole form, and it includes blue asbestos (crocidolite) and brown asbestos (amosite). This form is banned around the world is not used in Sri Lanka.
The other form  serpentine or chrysotile  is in use in Sri Lanka today and is used by the majority of countries around the world, including the USA, Brazil, China, Canada, Russia, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and many others. Chrysotile fibre products do not cause any significant health issues.

The tournament was worked off at the Race Course grounds in Colombo yesterday.
The match got off to an exciting start when the Thomian scrum half Dion Diad collected a pass and dummies his way to score under the post in the second minute and himself made the easy conversion. Thomians led 7 points to Nil.
Within the space of two minutes S. Thomas centre Mayon Jayawardena touched down for a try near the left upright after a beautiful three quarter move. Dias made the difficult conversion and the score read 14 points to nil in favour of Thomians.
In the sixth minute of play Isipathana scored a fabulous try when their speedy wing three quarter Nadeesha Chaminda burst through for a try under the post covering nearly 50 metres to give their skipper Chamod Fernando an easy conversion to cut down the lead by 14 points to 7.
This score remained till the half time.
After the resumption Thomians increased the lead in the 12th minute when their dynamic captain and winger Navin Heanakankanamge scored a sensational try after a 40 metre solo run down the right flank passing several Pathana defenders. Referee disallowed the conversion due to Dias taking too long to make the conversion but S. Thomas increased the lead further by 19 points to 7. In the final minute of play Isipathana forward Sudeera Gaynath collected the ball and scampered through for a fantastic consolation try and the conversion was made by captain Chamod ones again but finally Mount Lavinia lads ran out worthy winners.
Earlier in the Cup semi finals S. Thomas beat Trinity College Kandy by 21 points (3 Goals) to 14 (2 Goals) with captain Naveen Heanakankanamge scoring all three tries for the Thomians and in the other semi final Isipathana College edged out a fighting Kingswood College Kandy by 19 points (2 Goals, 1 Try) to 14 (2 Goals).

The rules, envisaged as threshold requirements to be adopted on both an initial and continuing basis, took effect in January 2017, with a grace period of six months ending June 30, 2017 being extended to companies failing to comply with the requirement as of December 31, 2016.
In keeping with the decision to introduce enforcement measures in respect of companies failing to comply with the revised rules on minimum public holding prior to June 30, 2017, the SEC approved policies including the transfer of non-compliant companies to a Watch List (Default Board).
Accordingly, companies found non-compliant with the minimum public holding requirement as of July 1, 2017 would be transferred to the Watch List on 1st July 2018 unless due compliance is achieved prior to that date, while others which become non-compliant following July 1, 2017 would be transferred to the Watch List within six months of such non-compliance or on July 1,2018, whichever date is later. Companies which become non-compliant on any date following July 1,2018 would be transferred to the Watch List within six months from the date of non-compliance unless due compliance is achieved in the interim.
Other actions contemplated by the SEC enforcement policy include the making of timely market disclosures on public holding positions of non-compliant companies and disclosures on remedial action proposed by such companies.
This enforcement policy has been introduced following the grant of a period of over three years since the initial introduction of minimum public holding as a continuous listing requirement in 2013 and a further grace period of six months. This extension of time is characteristic of the accommodative and perceptive regulatory approach adopted by the SEC, and takes cognisance of the need for a reasonable timeframe within which non-compliant companies may take remedial action with respect to public holding requirements.

Second volume of Derivative/Hedging Deals released
Nihal Sri Ameresekere sets out facts of dubious derivative/hedging deals, in two public interest litigations
In Derivative/Hedging DealsVolume II(published by AuthorHouse UK), author Nihal Sri Ameresekere has professionally lucidly set out facts of dubious derivative/hedging deals, in two public interest litigations instituted in Sri Lanka, seeking 'anti-suit injunctions', citing renowned authorities, to prevent foreign legal proceedings and for these transactions perpetrated collusively by Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank and Deutsche Bank on their customer, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, to be adjudicated before the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, as the most 'appropriate forum'.
According to the author, this has been mysteriously strenuously opposed by the attorney general of Sri Lanka, appearing for state agencies and for himself, on baseless objection of 'time bar', resulting in the supreme Court questionably upholding such objection, with the author pointing out the 'ludicrousy' of such order.
As a consequence, the High Court of Justice of the United Kingdom had granted judgment in favour of Standard Chartered Bank. A three-member arbitral tribunal of the London Court of International Arbitration having recognized the true nature as wagering contracts had rejected the Citibank claim, notwithstanding the UK High Court Judgment regarding the Standard Chartered Bank case having been adduced before them.
A three-member arbitral tribunal of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes had a division, with two members awarding the Deutsche Banks claim, with a 'gaming claim interpreted as an investment' and one member dissenting pointing out that the winnings of a gaming claim cannot be an investment. This could open floodgates to prevent recovery of stolen assets stashed overseas.
Ironically, the attorney general of Sri Lanka had relied on persons who had to be investigated and who had been compromised by these banks to give evidence and with resultant settlements. What is emphasized is that 'economic terrorism' germinates 'armed terrorism', resulting in the violation of human rights. Concerns of humanity transcends interests of nationality, says the author.
Nihal Sri Ameresekere, a multi-disciplinary professional, well exposed to private and public sectors, is a public interest activist in Sri Lanka, with wide international exposure. Not a legal professional, yet he has appeared in person before the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, successfully advocating public interest litigations with the expansion into human rights and civil society responsibility.

A singer, a doctor and a kingdom
On social media recently I came across the wedding photographs of a young female singer. In the traditional wedding costume, she was radiant. Taken with obvious professionalism, the photography brought out the hope and joy of the beginning of a young couples new life with poignancy.
As a songstress, Sahali Gamage came to national attention in 2009 when she rendered the euphoric song Maha-Rajanini( Great king). We had just vanquished the LTTE, the terror organisation which for long had menaced the land, bringing death and destruction in its wake. The country was jubilant, the dark cloud that hung over it was gone, now we could look forward to nation building, peaceful and transparent.
Naturally, a lot of credit went to the then government of President Rajapaksa for the leadership provided in the long drawn out battle against the terror group which had by then established a de facto government over a part of the country. So entrenched were they that in the final years they fought like a regular army, defending territory; against a much larger and better equipped Sri Lankan army.
Bloodiest conflicts
The actual battleground was relatively small, perhaps 5,000 square miles in all. In Western Australia, there is a farm named Anna Creek Station which is said to be around 9,000 square miles in size. But that is not the largest farm in the world. There are two gigantic farms in China which are said to be about three times the size of Anna Creek Station, about the size of Sri Lanka! The approximately 100,000 casualties we suffered in the thirty some years of sporadic fighting does not qualify our war to be among the bloodiest conflicts in recent times. Similar conflicts lately in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, for example, have resulted in greater blood-letting in much shorter periods of fighting. In World War 2 in just four years of war Russia alone suffered more than 20 million dead. Be that as it may, the threat posed by the LTTE nearly unhinged our impassive status-quo, challenging whatever political and military skills it possessed to the hilt. It cannot be taken away that it was the Rajapaksa government which took up the military challenge posed by the LTTE and fought it to a finish.
Every nation is different and every culture is unique. The response to stimuli is not often uniform. There is a motor accident; people gather, the police arrive and the law takes its course. However negligent, it is understood by all concerned that the act was not intended. The law will decide the appropriate punishment. An accident happens in another country; the people gather, they assault the driver and burn the vehicle (thus destroying the evidence!). Those in the mob could be anybody; a three wheel driver, a rubber tapper, a hospital orderly, village thug, a busybody. It cannot be claimed that in their line of work they are negligence-free. On the contrary, experience tells us that when they get to work anything that could go wrong would go wrong. While a passenger on an urgent journey is in the three-wheeler, it suddenly runs out of fuel; the driver had forgotten to fill the tank in the morning. The rubber trees will not be fertilised on time; the tapper neglecting that vital exercise because the benefits are a too long term for him. Many a patient suffers because the wrong medicine will be administered to him by the hospital staff, who will also overlook the stocking of essential medicine. These are typical acts of negligence that do not get noticed only because of their prevalence. But here at the scene of the motorcar accident, there is a righteous rage; it is the mob instinct, the thrill of its destructive power, not rationality that governs.
Maha-Rajanini proclaims a king, one who has united the land. As commonly said, everything is relative and seen through particular eyes. In the Second World War, Britain had to fight the most formidable of enemies, the world class German army. When the war was finally won (after a collective and massive effort by the Allies) the British did not think of making Churchill, their combative Prime Minister the King, and thereby replace the constitutional monarchy of George VI. How much ever the British gave thanks, a Churchill dynasty was not in the cards. Things were seen and understood in a certain perspective. For about two decades Osama Bin-Laden was Americas public enemy number one. President Clinton tried to eliminate him, Bush Jnr used all resources at his disposal to get him, but they both failed. Finally, it was President Barrack Obama, or rather during his presidency, that America settled scores with their primary enemy. America exulted. But, no one suggested that Obama quietly converts his presidency into a royalty!
Prabakaran enjoyed the absolute and unfettered power of a feudal king. He could have with a nod of his head eliminated anybody living in the area under his control and claim that the victim was an enemy of the people.
The person who carried out the assassination would be declared a great nationalist. If Prabakaran wanted any land, house or vehicle in his domain he had to only decide that they were needed for the cause. And, as in any feudal order, Prabakaran could anoint his son as successor and all that his followers could do was to hail the decision as divinely ordained.
Did Sahali Gamage really want a king (and a kingdom) for us too I think not. According to the information available on social media, the pretty musician is an intelligent young woman. She did not want some hocus-pocus career; astrology, political functionary or even as a lady in waiting in a royal court. Instead, she aspired to a career in Western medicine, a calling that is bound to give her individuality, career satisfaction and intellectual enrichment.
In the kingdom, the Advance Level examination is sudden death to those students who do not obtain the required aggregate in marks. It could be that on that day (day of the examination) or that time, the student is having a bad patch in his/her studies. Such is the variety and the richness of life that it may well happen that later, with maturity, that student could turn out to be a much better doctor than those who reach their intellectual peak in their mid-teens. But in the kingdom, failure at the Advance Level examination is goodbye to all hope. The system is unrelenting. So Sahali had to enrol, for a short period, at the controversial SAITM to pursue studies in medicine.
Hope and opportunity
Outside of the kingdom, life is an ever-renewing cycle of hope and opportunity. A shortfall at one examination at some point in life does not mean the door is slammed on your face for good. Sahali later left Sri Lanka to study medicine in a Western country, a country that accepted her, gave her an opportunity to study medicine and then become a doctor.
While the truth is so obvious, we insist on defining the present in terms of a dead past. Our points of reference are of kings and kingdoms, old schools and family connections.
Having paid our meaningless homage to these symbols of failure, we see no hypocrisy in taking to the sky to beg for development aid or scholarships from countries so unlike us. We have to emplane to the Arab countries to earn a decent living. For those who want a good life for their families, access to quality services and a society where there is a rule of law, it is the West that gives hope. Indeed, narrow is the corner we dwell in, but narrower still seems the minds and spirit therein.
Sahalis good fortune did not end with her opportunity to study Western medicine. After her marriage, she reportedly intends to settle down in Canada and raise her family in the wholesome environment of a Republic which is truly democratic. I have no doubt that the life she has chosen will reward her with many blessings. We can only wish her the very best.

SLIM urges firms to get benefit of  marketing guru Ron Kaufman
Etching an exciting new milestone for Sri Lanka's business fraternity, the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) prepares to welcome the world's No 1 guru in service, Ron Kaufman, to Sri Lanka, on July 18 and 19.
With just less than one month to go, these must-attend hallmark events scheduled during Kaufman's two-day visit will focus on maximizing the role service plays in this evolutionary era of both local and global change.
Given the unprecedented demand from corporates for this event, SLIM has added on a bonus for those who wish to have exclusive one-on-ones with Kaufman.
At a media conference held on May 30 announcing the launch of this much looked forward to event, a strong message put forth by SLIM was that the 200 participants who will interact with this global service consultant, speaker, educator, thought leader and customer service exponent, will undoubtedly benefit immensely from his revolutionary yet practical tenets of service and customer leadership.
Whether it's the corporate heads who will participate at the CEO Breakfast Forum on July19 at Cinnamon Grand or HR managers, trainers and front and back office teams joining the Knowledge Forum on July 18 at Waters Edge, each will gain valuable insights and be able to penetrate deep into a service-driven culture that forms the winning formula for an organization's unequivocal success.
I have never seen anyone present so much valuable information in such a short period of time and do it so delightfully, said Paul Snider, Program Committee Chair of the Harvard Business School Alumni Association.
This statement rings true as Kaufman himself takes Sri Lanka through the process of building a sustainable service culture.
I'm going to make that service culture come alive, he says of the programs he intends to conduct in Sri Lanka.
What's the architecture How do you build an environment that inspires people, encourages people and enables people When you're doing that within an organization, you need a structure with three fundamental elements; a foundation of continuous service improvement where everyone is focused on stepping up to create more value for other people."
"We need leadership behavior that gives direction and protection to everything that goes on in that corporate house and finally, there are the building blocks, twelve key areas of activity, which I will make real for you with practical examples, case studies and illustrations from all over the world.
"SLIM President Karthik Elangovan said, As the national body for marketing, SLIM has an integral responsibility in adding value to the nation's ambitious development agenda."
"A service leadership culture in the business sphere is what the country will be exposed to, by the world's foremost Service Guru, Ron Kaufman. For more information, visit www.slim.lk.

Solutions to rising seas
Like cheese in France or cars in Germany, climate change is a business in the Netherlands. Delegations from as far away as Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, New York and New Orleans come to the port city of Rotterdam.
No place in Europe is under greater threat than this waterlogged country on the edge of the Continent. Much of the nation sits below sea level and is gradually sinking. Now climate change brings the prospect of rising tides and fiercer storms. The Dutch devise lakes, garages, parks and plazas useful to daily life but also double as enormous reservoirs for when the seas and rivers spill over.
The new rowing course just outside Rotterdam, where the World Rowing Championships were staged last summer forms part of an area called the Eendragtspolder, a 22-acre patchwork of reclaimed fields and canals  a prime example of a site built as a public amenity that collects floodwater in emergencies. It is near the lowest point in the Netherlands, about 20 feet below sea level. With its bike paths and water sports, the Eendragtspolder has become a popular retreat. Now it also serves as a reservoir for the Rotte River Basin when the nearby Rhine overflows, which, because of climate change, its expected to do every decade.
The project is among dozens in a nationwide programme, called Room for the River. The Netherlands effectively occupies the gutter of Europe, lowlands bounded on one end by the North Sea, into which immense rivers like the Rhine and the Meuse flow from Germany, Belgium and France. Dutch thinking changed after floods forced hundreds of thousands to evacuate during the 1990s.
Harold van Waveren, a senior government adviser, recently explained. We cant just keep building higher levees because we will end up living behind 10-meter walls, he said. We need to give the rivers more places to flow. Protection against climate change is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain, and the chain in our case includes not just the big gates and dams at the sea but a whole philosophy of spatial planning, crisis management, childrens education, online apps and public spaces.
Reshaping Neighbourhoods in Rotterdam
Dakpark, a dike in a poor, largely immigrant neighbourhood bordering industrial waterfront has a shopping centre, which the neighbourhood needed, and a park on the roof. Shops face the waterfront and help pay to keep up the park. The park slopes from the roof down to streets and housing blocks, creating a grassy hill that links park and neighbourhood. Formal gardens open onto acres of well-kept lawns. The park is a kilometre long. Its success  not only as a barrier but also as a boon to business and the area  has persuaded officials to consult neighbourhoods and set aside money for community-initiated projects.
A start-up in a converted industrial waterfront building is developing solar-powered sailing drones for collecting plastic trash from the sea, and, back in the middle of the city, a warehouse with a mix of artisanal food stalls, a circus academy and a pinball museum has rejuvenated a formerly dingy pier.
Rotterdam is trying to cast itself as a model of inventive urbanism. A local businessman, Peter van Wingerden, envisions floating dairy farms along the waterfront. One in every three trucks coming into the city carries food, he said. Floating farms would reduce truck traffic and carbon emissions, supplying the city with its own milk. With the citys encouragement, he is constructing a $2.2 million prototype, for 40 cows, producing half-million liters (about 130,000 gallons) of milk a year. Molenaar, Rotterdams climate chief, summed up the Dutch view: We have been able to put climate change adaptation high on the public agenda without suffering a disaster in many years because we have shown the benefits of improving public space  the added economic value of investing in resilience.
Its in our genes, he said. Water managers were the first rulers of the land. Designing the city to deal with water was the first task of survival here and it remains our defining job. Its a process, a movement.
It is not just a bunch of dikes and dams, but a way of life.
Message for Sri Lanka
We have felt the impact of deluges in two successive years. Sufficient reason to wake us up. We are blessed with so much water with more on the way. Unlike the Netherlands or Maldives, we are not below sea level yet. The country already has the man and natural waterways with new streams opening due to development, illegal construction, silt and runs off of massive sudden quanta due to rain. Urban development and demand for housing are increasingly restricting natural seepage of water into the water table below reducing ground water recharging.
Is it not the time to harvest water differently At a time when our springs are drying up, hills and slopes are generating landslides traditional water sources may become scarce. We should plan for contingencies and use it as an opportunity.
We spend a considerable amount of time battling the impact of floods. Can we not turn it into a positive agenda Its time we looked at floodwater harvesting as an asset to use. Climate change may well trigger new ways of looking at our surrounding environment.

Spinners Lakshan, Hasaranga bamboozle Zimbabwe to defeat
Zimbabwe who treated the Sri Lankan spinners with disdain to pull off a shock win in the first ODI on Friday were suddenly all at sea against two spinners whom they had never come up against Lakshan Sandakan who bowls left-arm chinaman and debutant Wanindu Hasaranga, right-arm leg break and googly prior to yesterdays second ODI at the Galle International Stadium.
Hasaranga celebrates his first ODI wicket after bowling Malcolm Waller 
The result was more or less a foregone conclusion when Zimbabwe succumbed to 155 all out in 33.4 overs and Sri Lanka despite losing two early wickets cantered home to win by seven wickets with nearly 20 overs to spare and level the five-match series one-all.
It was a remarkable turnaround by Sri Lanka after being swept away two days ago by a team ranked lower than them. It was a test of their character and they came back fighting with flying colours.
Upul Tharanga followed his unbeaten knock of 79 on Friday with another sensible innings of 75 not out to add stability to the middle order after Danuskha Gunathilaka and Kusal Mendis had thrown their wickets away off successive balls playing indiscreet shots to Tendai Chatara making Sri Lanka 10-2.
Tharanga was involved in two half century stands with Niroshan Dickwella (35) and Angelo Mathews (28 not out) to completely seal the match in Sri Lankas favour.
Sandakan finished with career best figures of four for 52 off 10 overs and 19-year-old Hasaranga marked a memorable ODI debut by performing the hat-trick  only the third to achieve the feat after Taijul Islam of Bangladesh (v Zimbabwe 2014) and Kagiso Rabada of South Africa (v Bangladesh 2015) to end up taking three wickets for 15. He became Sri Lankas 180th ODI cricketer when he was presented his cap prior to the commencement of play by chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya.
Hasaranga who was brought onto bowl in the 26th over cleaned up the Zimbabwe tail by capturing the wickets of Malcolm Waller (bowled), Donald Tiripano (lbw) and Tendai Chatara (bowled) off successive deliveries.
The difference in Sri Lankas approach to yesterdays game and the one played on Friday was that there was more intensity and purpose on the field by the players and they brought in Sandakan and Hasaranga to replace Akila Dananjaya and Amila Aponso who together had leaked 138 runs off 18 overs.
Sandakan especially presented a different threat to the Zimbabwean batsmen. The sweep and reverse sweep that Zimbabwe employed so successfully in the first ODI on Friday didnt quite work out to plan as three of their top six in the order perished attempting to play it.
Sandakan who took the Man of the Match award was playing his first match after sitting out the entire Champions Trophy without a game and being forced to miss the first ODI due to flu. He made it a memorable one for him taking important wickets in the middle period to help Sri Lanka to level the series.
The Zimbabweans already baffled by Sandakans dexterity were further confounded by Hasarangas leg-spin and googlies as their batting crumbled under pressure.
Asela Gunaratne who has the knack of picking up wickets whenever he is brought on held a brilliant one handed return catch to send back the dangerous Hamilton Masakadza. That catch alone compensated for the three that were put down during the Zimbabwe innings. Masakadza was missed before he had scored by Kusal Mendis at slip off Lasith Malinga off the third ball of the match. Thankfully unlike in the first ODI it didnt prove to be too costly.
Sri Lanka was lucky they finished the match as early as half past three because an hour later the heavens opened out and the rains came down heavily.
Both teams now travel to Hambantota for the remaining three ODIs commencing July 6.
Hat-tricks by Sri Lanka bowlers in ODIs
Richmond College, Sri Lanka Under 19 and CCC right-arm leg-spin and googly bowler Wanindu Hasaranga became the fifth Sri Lankan bowler to perform the hat-trick in One-Day Internationals during the second ODI against Zimbabwe at the Galle International Stadium yesterday.
The list is:
Chaminda Vaas v Zimbabwe (SSC) 2001
Chaminda Vaas v Bangladesh (Pietermaritzburg) 2003
Lasith Malinga v South Africa (Georgetown) 2007

Stop stress eating
People deal with stress in several different ways - some chew on nails, others have sudden outbursts and some find themselves reaching for a bag of potato chips.
Stress eating is a common coping mechanism when dealing with pressure but it's far from a healthy way to handle stress.
Nutritionists agree that the bad habit can happen to anyone and reveal their tips to resist the urge.
They recommend going for a walk, ditching your cell phone and making a great music playlist, among others to distract the brain from wanting junk food.
Experts warn that when stress eating isn't managed, it can turn into a full-blown eating disorder which can lead to serious health issues.
The health risks of stress eating
Those who stress eat tend to overeat, which can later develop into unhealthy weight gain.
Stress is caused by a spike in the hormone called cortisol, which elevates blood sugar levels and makes the body crave sugar.
This makes people tend to reach for sweets and different types of junk food.
These foods are not only loaded with sugar, but are high in carbs, calories and fat.
They often have little fiber, protein or any nutritional value.
High consumption of these foods can lead to people being overweight and obese, which increases the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
Ways to beat stress eating
1. Go for a walk
Lyndi Cohen, of the Nude Nutritionist, said going for a walk is the simplest thing to do to combat stress eating.
The Australian native said she had a first-hand experience with stress eating and once she realized the signs, she dropped 40lbs.
Cohen said: 'Often, we stress eat out of habit and instinct.
'So going for a walk can help break the cycle, by distracting your brain from the cravings and help you get endorphins from somewhere other than chocolate.
'Even a 10 minute walk has been shown to help buffer stress by increasing these "feel good" chemicals released in your brain.'
She said to wait an hour to see if these cravings still exist before eating.
Cohen added: 'By creating this "buffer period", you allow time for the craving to go away and for your stress levels to reduce.
'If you arent willing to delay gratification for an hour, Id still recommend trying to distract yourself, even if its for just 10 minutes or half an hour.'
2. Ditch your cell phone
Dietitian Cassie said that although phones seem to be a form of distraction, it ultimately doesn't give people an intentional break from stress.
She said that sometimes work emails or unwanted texts can creep into mindless phone time, spiking stress levels.
Cohen adds: 'Also, scrolling on your cell phone while youre eating creates mindless eating so youre more likely to overeat.
'Put your cell phone down, monitor how long you scroll for and become a mindful eater by turning off devices when you eat.'
Cassie agreed and said: 'Using a phone can be seen as an escape but there is still that buildup of stress. You need to be intentional with how you are relaxing.'
She explains that stress is caused by a hormone called cortisol, which increases blood sugar levels and makes the body crave sugar.
Cassie said: 'This is why we crave sugar or high carb foods when we are stressed. Relaxation techniques are super effective because if you stabilize your blood sugar levels you won't crave the sweets.'
3. Make the perfect playlist
Cohen said making a playlist is a perfect way to de-stress because music is a natural relaxer.
She said focusing on calming songs and compiling them into a track list will distract the mind from craving sugary or salty foods.
Cohen suggests: 'Try listening to music that puts you into a good mood or new music that will engage and distract you. 'Another option is to listen to a podcast or a book as these can also take your mind off your cravings.'
Music has long been known to be a relaxation method, especially if it's classical music.
A study by German researchers last June found that the music of Mozart and Strauss significantly lowered stress, blood pressure and heart rates.
4. Get some sleep
If you find yourself eating away feelings of stress, you might want to try getting a better night's sleep.
Stress during the workday can lead to overeating and unhealthy food choices at dinnertime, research from the University of Michigan and the University of Illinois warns. But a good night's sleep can counter the effect of stress during the day on overeating in the evening, according to the June study.
Being well rested helps people to cope with unexpected problems at work and makes it less likely that they will turn to junk food in the evening, researchers said.
The study found that workday stress was linked to employees negative mood while on the job, which in turn was linked to unhealthy eating in the evening.
The study is one of the first to investigate how psychological experiences at work shape our eating patterns.

Super foods that will lower levels of stress and are healthy to eat:
* Bananas * Cucumbers * Avocados * Blueberries * Asparagus * Celery* Milk * Almonds * Oranges * Salmon * Spinach * Turkey n Oatmeal
Why you need to get stress eating under control
Melainie Rogers is a certified eating disorder dietitian and founder of the BALANCE eating disorder treatment center in New York.
She agrees with the tips to keep stress eating at bay and said that if the issue isn't handled, it can develop into a full-blown eating disorder.
Rogers said: 'If someone isn't able to use these methods to control their eating, then it can turn into a cycle of emotional eating or binge eating.
'They will obviously gain weight and then eventually try to go on a diet. But because they never addressed the root of their problem, they will eventually fall off the wagon, whether in a week or a month.
'They'll end up over-eating again, stress about it, and a wave of binge eating starts. They can end up with a full-fledged eating disorder.'
The expert said besides the physical aspect of weight gain, lots of people with this kind of eating disorder have anxiety and depression.
Their self-esteem and confidence plummets, and they just feel out of control, Rodgers added.
Rogers said those who feel they are stress eating must first acknowledge their problem and then use tips to combat the eating.
She said if a person can't use the self-help tips, then it may be time to seek out a professional dietitian or therapist.

Surge in Diplomacy, Action in Mediation
The fourth edition of the Istanbul Conference on Mediation took place on June 30 with the theme of 'Surge in Diplomacy, Action in Mediation.' Experts, diplomats, practitioners and scholars from around the world will explore ways and means to promote mediation as a prominent conflict-prevention and resolution method.
The profile of mediation has been rising globally since Turkey and Finland led the way at the United Nations through the 'Mediation for Pace' initiative. The initiative culminated in the establishment of the 'Group of friends of Mediation.' The group now has 53 members, including 48 states and 5 international organisations. There has also been substantial improvement in international capacity for preventive diplomacy and mediation within the UN, regional and sub-regional organisations and civil society. The Group has become the leading platform at the UN to promote mediation. It has initiated the adoption of four UN General Assembly Resolutions, which lay the ground for the development of the normative and conceptual framework of mediation. The Group has also contributed to the 2012 'United Nations Guidance for Effective Mediation,' a fundamental document for those who practice and study mediation worldwide.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has expressed his willingness to further develop UN's mediation support capacity. His efforts are most commendable. We call on all UN member states to support UNSG Guterres' broad vision and efforts to prevent and solve today's conflicts. Turkey has been doing her part. Turkey is situated next to a vast region where acute active and frozen conflicts persist. Prevention and peaceful resolution of conflicts is a central feature of Turkey's enterprising and humanitarian foreign policy. Turkey undertakes various efforts in a wide geography from Africa to the Middle East, the Balkans and the Caucasus. She sees peacemaking in a humanitarian development nexus. This year, Turkey has again become the most generous nation in the world in terms of per capita humanitarian assistance.
Turkey has been hosting the Instabul Conferences on Mediation since 2012. These landmark conferences are designed to bring together numerous practitioners and scholars in the field of conflict-prevention and mediation activities.
The aim of these conferences is to promote synergies between theory and practice and help increase scope, reach and effectiveness of the international community's mediation efforts. I must pay tribute to the efforts of mediators engaging daily in conflicts worldwide.
This year, the conference will explore how mediation methodology and practice and take better account of the needs of the day. In this regard, two questions in particular would be scrutinized. One is the potential of mediation in all stages of a conflict continuum, namely from prevention to resolution and all the way to peace agreement implementation. The second key question would be the models for greater employment of mediation as a preventive tool in contexts where political, ethnic, religious biases create an environment of hostility.
The latter is especially pertinent since we have come to sadly witness extreme tendencies in various forms of political, social and religious animosities.
The rise in attacks in Europe against Muslims and migrants is a case in point. Prevention is key. However, prevention would be possible only when societies recognize and learn to respect differences and engage in genuine dialogue and interaction. I believe that mediators who are well-equipped with the cultural codes of conduct in a given conflict situation can reach remarkable success. For that, we need to train more mediators including at youth while encouraging more women mediators and equip them with the right tools.
Our challenges to make peace the overwhelming reality on a global level are immense. However, we should be able to see the opportunities within those challenges. The readiness and willingness of the international community to build capacity in peaceful resolution of conflicts including mediation must be a priority. As we prepare to welcome participants of the Fourth Istanbul Mediation Conference, I call on the international community to take action in mediation.

The Tea Story of Ceylon began in the year 1824, when the first tea plant was brought in to the country by the British from China and planted in the Royal Botanical Gardens in Peradeniya. This soon led to tea being a preferred beverage amongst all residents across the island. But it was in 1867 that James Taylor - a Scotsman who began tea plantation as a commercial tea crop on just 19 acres of land in Loolecondera Estate in Kandy. 150 years later, Ceylon Tea is synonymous with quality and is now a global favourite!

Tunisian envoy in Sri Lanka visits  Chamber to discuss bilateral trade
Tunisian envoy to Sri Lanka, Nejmeddine Lakhal, says commercial ties between Sri Lanka and Tunisia should be enhanced, as two-way trade between the two nations stands at a negligible level at present.
The envoy who is based in New Delhi made this comment when he visited the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday to discuss the way forward to enhance trade and investments between the two nations.
He met with Dhara Wijayatilake, CEO of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and Lilakshini De Mel, a Senior Assistant Secretary General of the Chamber, who is in-charge of Bilateral Business Councils.
"Trade exchange between the two nations is very low. We have to find ways to enhance it by diversifying trade between the two countries," Ambassador Nejmeddine said during discussions with the Chamber.
Both parties agreed to find opportunities to organizing two-way business delegations and organize B2B meetings between business counterparts of both destinations.
The visiting ambassador from the North African country also said that Sri Lankan investors can explore the Free Trade Agreements Tunisia has signed with neighboring countries and also tax free zones established in Tunisia to make investments.
Mukthar Marikkar, Honorary Consul of the Republic of Tunisia in Sri Lanka, also accompanied Ambassador Nejmeddine Lakhal, to the meeting. The trade between Sri Lanka and Tunisia during the year 2016 stood around a mere US$ 2 million, with the trade balance in favor of Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka mainly exports items such as tea, spices, rubber and related articles to that country, while Tunisias main exports to Sri Lanka are electrical machinery and equipments and parts.

Tunisian investors can benefit from JVs with Lankan firms exporting to EU
The enhanced market access that Sri Lanka gets from EU GSP+ is very significant, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen after meeting New Delhi based Tunisian Ambassador to Sri Lanka Nejmeddine Lakhal who visited the Minister at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce recently.
An unprecedented basket of exports from Sri Lanka is now smiling big as a result of the recent GSP plus eligibility-even more so is the promise of FDI.
Lakhal had inquired from Minister Bathiudeen of joint venture potentials between private sectors of both countries. Joining the discussion was Consul General of Consulate of the Republic of Tunisia in Colombo Mukthar Marikkar and officials of the Department of Commerce. Tunisia-SL trade stands far below its potential and it is time we take a close look, said Tunisian Ambassador Lakhal, and added: We both have similar trade and investment challenges and we can work for win-win. Tunisia can partner with Sri Lanka in joint ventures, exports for Asian and African markets.
Tunisian investors can benefit from joint ventures with Lankan firms exporting to EU, especially since our recent GDP Plus eligibility. Tunisia is closer to EU therefore Tunisian manufacturers cannot go for South Asian markets but by setting up JVs here they can solve this responded Minister Bathiudeen and added: They can use Sri Lankas FTAs with India and Pakistan to export 8,000 products tariff free to these two countries. Our government is also working on FTAs with China and Singapore. Therefore the increase in market access is huge, and the bigger surprise is increased FDI appeal for Sri Lanka. I and my Ministry are ready to extend our fullest support to Tunisian investors setting up here to exploit these trade facilities. This can also help kick-start the non-existent bilateral trade between Tunisia and Sri Lanka which though small, shows strong growth trend. Therefore I believe it is time to commence our trade in a stronger way.
The two way trade between Sri Lanka and Tunisia in 2016 was a mere US $ 2.13 million and therefore both countries are virgin markets to each other. Despite the low volumes, trade showed a growing trend, doubling from 2015s $1 million. Nearly half of Sri Lankas exports to Tunisia last year was Ceylon Tea. Main imports from Tunisia to Sri Lanka were electric switches and transformers.
Responding to Tunisian Ambassador Lakhals query on new potentials from recent EU GSP Plus, Minister Bathiudeen said,The enhanced market access that Sri Lanka gets from EU GSP Plus is not small but very significant. In fact, according to the Department of Commerce under me, 6,200 products from Sri Lanka are benefitting from EU GSP Plus. The 6,200 can be exported duty free to EU. The other benefit is Sri Lanka in return need not give similar zero tariff for any EU products since its a unilateral concession from EU to us. This makes the GSP facility, a very attractive opening for our exporters, manufacturers and more importantly, for international investors setting up here-including Tunisian. EU is Sri Lankas biggest exports destination. Two thirds of export tariff lines to EU are now duty free, among them textiles and fisheries. We believe the increase in annual export revenue from GSP plus to be $ 350 million or more. We are also excited of the FDI potential due to GSP since studies show bigger FDIs possible from GSP Plus.
International studies on the economic effects of EU GSP Plus have shown a 30% surge in exports for the beneficiary. As for FDIs, the potential of increase for the beneficiary (post-GSP Plus) is more than double the pre-GSP Plus FDI quantum-a 213% increase to be exact.

The value of art without value
Ben Lerners 10:04 is not a conventional novel. It is a brilliant, piecemeal collection of entwining narratives; the book succeeds on the strength of its beautifully lucid stories, but one in particular leaves a lasting impression. In it, Lerners nameless narrator is invited to visit the Institute for Totaled Art  a collection of once-valuable artworks declared legally worthless for insurance purposes, housed in his on-off girlfriends Brooklyn apartment.
It was wonderful to see an icon of art world commercialism and valorised stupidity shattered, the narrator, who closely resembles Lerner, declares after holding the small fragments of a broken Jeff Koons Balloon Dog, once worth thousands of pounds, but now officially worthless.
The Balloon Dog, like all the works in the institute, had been declared a total loss by insurers. When a valuable piece of art is damaged  dropped, torn, burnt or otherwise  to the extent that the owner of the work and an appraiser agree that it cannot be restored, or the cost of the restoration would be too high, it is totalled. The insurer pays out the value of the work, which is then legally declared zero value. But these works are not destroyed. Instead they are left in vast warehouses by the insurers, demoted from art to mere objecthood and banned from circulation, removed from the market, relegated to this strange limbo, in the words of Lerners narrator.
Quick to judge
It is this limbo that prompted the Polish-American artist Elka Krajewska to set up the Salvage Art Institute (SAI), on which Lerner based his story. In 2012, the institute staged its first exhibition, No Longer Art, in New York, after securing a number of totalled art works from AXA Art, one of the worlds biggest art insurance firms. Since then it has grown, with an essay collection expected next year and a new exhibition at BNKR Space in Munich in November. The SAI explores the phenomenon of No Longer Art  Krajewskas preferred term for written off pieces  and the questions it poses. When is art beyond repair Are we too quick to judge art by its monetary value What separates art from objecthood
The first question is not as clear as it may seem. Although a total loss is declared when an insurer and owner agree that a piece is unsalvageable, there are instances where the owners sentimental valuation and the insurers commercial valuation collide. Julia Nagle, one of Londons most respected art conservators, has dealt with a number of such instances. While she was conserving art part-time in Cambridge, a professor of philosophy brought her a set of Voodoo paintings, bought from an artist in Haiti, but later damaged in a fire. The paintings themselves were not high value, she says. But to him they were because theyre one off things.
The cost of restoration outstripped the value of the paintings, so the insurer offered to pay out as a total loss on the works, but this meant the professor would have to hand the paintings over, even though they were irreplaceable. It is really hard, I think, if people are very emotionally attached to things and theyre not of huge value, Nagle adds. You cant get a total payout and then keep the artwork. In the end this is what mattered to the professor, who rejected the payout and paid for restoration of the works himself.
Zero value
The difficulty in establishing whether a piece is a total loss or not is compounded by the fact that insurers often try to restore works once they have been totalled, in order to recoup some of their losses. This presents a problem for the SAI, which sets out to maintain the zero-value of no longer art in its manifesto.
There was an Ed Ruscha painting in the AXA London office, that has since disappeared  meaning that it has probably been resold, explains Krajewska. The institute will place markers at its Munich exhibition, showing where pieces of the collection would be sitting if they had not been resold by the insurers.
Works that are given a second life by insurers usually end up at auction houses where caveat emptor reigns  the onus is always on the buyer to establish the history of anything for sale. Reports commissioned by the auction houses may mention the fact that restoration has taken place, but they do not have to specify that it was ever a total loss. This gives fluidity to the definition of totalled art.
I think in every insurers office there are specialists actually working on how to place those works back into the market and so were trying to catch them before that happens, Krajewska says. Its a difficult process and whatever we get as donation [means] it automatically becomes easier, but sometimes our activity with the work is temporary.

Valverde breaks kneecap after Tour de France crash
DSSELDORF, Saturday  Spanish veteran Alejandro Valverde suffered a broken kneecap in a crash that knocked him out of the Tour de France on Saturday, his Movistar team said.
Valverdes departure is a blow to Tour contender Nairo Quintanas chances as he was due to help the Colombian Movistar leader in the mountains.
The 37-year-old Valverde, who was third overall two years ago, came down hard on a slippery bend in miserable wet conditions on Saturdays opening stage 14km time-trial.
The Murcian hit the ground at great speed and crashed straight into the barriers, (and was) incapable of continuing the race due to his great pain, said Movistar.
He was taken to a hospital in Dusseldorf suffering from a blow to the ribs as well as cuts.
A first test confirmed he had broken his left kneecap, added Movistar.
It is the third time Valverde has had to pull out of the Tour following his failure to finish in his first two participations in 2005 and 2006. Valverde seemed to jar his left leg when he touched his foot down as he lost his back wheel on the slippery corner, before skidding hard into the metal crash barriers. It was immediately clear he was in great pain and wouldnt be able to continue, but his team frantically tried to move him as he was stranded on the apex of a tricky bend, with many other riders set to come around it. Valverde was expected to play a pivotal role in helping twice runner-up Quintana in his bid to defeat reigning champion Chris Froome during the Tours mountain stages.
He wasnt the only rider to crash badly on the opening stage as compatriot Ion Izagirre also left the race while Frenchman Tony Gallopin was amongst several other riders unseated. Briton Geraint Thomas won the stage and will wear the leaders yellow jersey on Sundays second stage from Dusseldorf to Liege in Belgium.  AFP

Waning flair for fighting fire
With Colombo and its suburbs evolving into a burst of high-rise buildings, with many presently under construction and many more on the line, no adequate attention is given to safety measures in the event of a major fire.
United Kingdom's Sri Lanka branch of the Institute of Fire Engineers Secretary Nalaka Liyanapeli said, Sri Lankas fire safety measures cover only five percent of the international fire safety standards.
He highlighted the need to ensure safety of the occupants of the buildings during a crisis or calamity.
According to the statistics from the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), the country has fewer than 40 fire stations. Meanwhile, the vehicles and equipment currently being used are more than 15 years old.
According to the Sri Lanka Fire Service Department Acting Divisional Officer of Operations K.D Wijesooriya, these vehicleS need to be replaced every five years, but it has not been happening as only a little attention is given to the Fire Service Department.
More than half of all civilian fire stations are in the Western Province. The Southern and Central Provinces, each, has three stations, according to the CMC. The fire stations in other areas function either under municipal councils or 'pradeshiya sabhas'. The Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) has units at all of its air bases and they immediately respond, particularly when there is a fire in the vicinity of a base. However, only a few fire stations have professional fire fighters and necessary equipment to fight in the event of a major fire.
Fire prevention measuresnot up to the standard
The Construction industry Development Authority (CIDA) is the body tasked with devising fire safety regulations for buildings. These regulations, however, have not been devised since 2004. Even though fire safety measures is a necessary requirement with the increase in high-rise buildings coming up in many parts of the country, the committee appointed to bring revision is yet to introduce the regulations.
Chief Fire Officer P.N.R Fernando, meanwhile, said, the regulations are updated considering the increase in high-rise buildings in Colombo.
Fire service departments come under the local government authorities. Now, the Urban Development Authority (UDA) looks into the quality and standards of the buildings. They request the fire department to submit a report before issuing the compliance certificate, he said.
The owners of any building have to obtain a 'certificate of conformity' from the local government authority in the respective areas that it is situated. For commercial establishments, this also requires a fire safety assessment by the local fire brigade. Once the Fire Department gives the approval to the planning commission of the local authority, the certificate is awarded and people can move in. But, since this year, the Urban Development authority is responsible for issuing the compliance certificate.
According to Liyanepeli, the problems relevant to fire safety arises only after issuing the compliance certificate and added that the authorities should ensure that they comply with the fire prevention and safety standards.
He said, there are five main barriers which need to be considered during a fire risk assessment process and they are fire initiation, fire growth, smoke spread, facilitating occupant evacuation and facilitating fire department intervention. In addition to that, it has been clearly mentioned in the same ordinance, that the occupier should inform and get approval from the factory-inspecting engineers on following matters: if, after the grant of a certificate, it is proposed to make material extension, material structural alternation of the factory premises, to increase materially the number of persons, to begin to store or use explosive or highly inflammable material in the factory, materially to increase the extent of such storage or use, the occupier shall give a written notice of the proposal to the factory-inspecting engineer, he said.
Liyanapeli said, however, there is no law to conduct periodical fire risk assessment and to issue an annual certificate to ensure that the owners maintain proper standards.
People give less importance to fire prevention systemat many instances, the builders tend to change the initial plan and when they change it, they give less attention for fire prevention system, he said.
He highlighted the need to identify the hazards and urgent hazards in buildings and take necessary precautions and remedies.
Fire Service Departmenttotally ignored
We have very effective fire service departments in high density areas like Colombo, Gampaha, Kandy. We do two inspections every week; if there are any issues or improvements that need to be made, we give them recommendation to improve, said Fernando.
Acting divisional officer, Operation K.D. Wijesooriya, the Colombo fire brigade has three water bowsers, two ambulances, one rescue engine, two fire pumps, 4,000  8,000 litres of high-flow water, three hydraulic platforms, one foam counter and three support vehicles (jeeps).
However, these vehicles are more than 15 years old and the relevant authorities have failed to show considerable attention to replace these vehicles.
Wjisooriya said that they have informed the CMC on several occasions, pointing out the need to replace these vehicles, but even they are unable to do anything.
Fernando further said, with limited resources, they render a great service to the country in the wake of a crisis.
In two to three minutes, we would dispatch the team. The time taken to reach the destination may differ during day and night, he said.
Fire-Prevention Division Divisional Fire Officer Wimal Kularatne, meanwhile, emphasized that 60 percent of the buildings that are being constructed are super high-rise buildings and it is important to have a standard firefighting shaft in every building.
According to fire service department, up to 18m is a non-high-rise building, 18  30m is a medium-rise building, 30  60m is a high-rise building and Over 60m is a super-rise building.
Kulratne said that they do the outdoor firefighting up to 30m and above 30m, they need to do indoor firefighting and added that firefighting shafts include firefighting lobbies, temporary refugee areas, causality areas and life-saving equipment.
All these need to be well-planned and maintained. Life-safety should be the priority, he said.
He further said that there are many government institutions that are without proper fire-preventive measures and added that in government institutions, around 300 employees work in one floor and that it will not be very easy to manage if a fire breaks out.
If we go for an inspection, we check the stability, integrity and insulation (stopping the spreading of fire). Smoke, heated air and thermal radiation are three main factors that people need to be protected in the event of a fire, he said.
Despite a number of fires reported in Colombo, especially in old public buildings, the citys fire brigade has no legal power to warn or take action against institutions not adopting fire safety measures. The Fire Brigade does not come under empowering legislation such as the Fire and Rescue Services Acts existing in other countries such as Britain, even though it has been in operation since 1890s.
Wijesooriya said the fire brigade has no legal power to make it compulsory for government and private institutions to conduct fire drills, maintain fire extinguishers and hose reels and follow safety procedures.
Unfortunately, we only have powers to inspect and advise. It is a persons choice whether to take necessary precautions and we inspect only when we are requested. Usually, the private sector ensures adequate maintenance, but the public sector often neglects its safety measures, he said.
He further said neither the CMC nor the fire brigade can take the responsibility if any fire erupts in an authorized building.
Prank callsa huge problem
The fire service department said that they receive a number of prank calls every day and added that it is one of the major issues before dispatching a group for rescue operations.
We are sometimes fooled. They give us very correct details and a verification number as well. There were instances where we went to the destination, but there was no fire. People need to understand that we are doing a noble service, yet unfortunately, we are totally ignored, said Wijesooriya.
He further said people do not directly contact their emergency call service that is 101.
The public inform the police and the police inform us. Therefore, there is a delay in the communication process as well, he said.
He noted that the Fire Department has a 24-hour fire emergency call unit and said the public can call 101 for help.
People can know the basics
Liyanapeli said, a study has also shown that inability to tackle small fires lead to huge disasters and therefore, we have opportunities to prevent huge fires by learning to combat small ones.
If people knew the basics of how to combat fire at an initial stage, the spread of fire can be reduced. Small fires are very common in factories and failing to tackle it carefully would lead to a big fire. There is a mechanism for the factories and buildings, he said.
Liyanapeli said, the Fire Brigade does not have power and they are just considered as a service-rending institution.
They may not have enough resources to do that as well, according to the current system. They are currently used to extinguish fire, rescue people in case of emergency, to inspect the buildings and provide approval, he said.
He stressed that relevant government authorities have not given adequate attention to the Fire Service Department. The government and the relevant authorities need to pay more attention to impose law, regulations and standards, to ensure the safety of the people and most importantly, a mechanism to periodically check the standards of fire safety requirements, he added.

We changed our lengths and pace to stop the sweeps  Sandakan
Sri Lanka had certainly learnt from their mistakes fast. They successfully managed to stop the Zimbabwean batsmen from using the sweep and reverse sweep shots that eventually led to them dismissing the opponents for a mediocre total of 155 and then going on to win the second ODI by seven wickets at the Galle International Stadium yesterday.
Man of the Match Lakshan Sandakan who was the chief destroyer of the Zimbabwe innings finishing with career best figures of 4 for 52 explained, We had a few plans against their batters. We carried them out very well I thought. They were scoring heavily off the sweeps, we identified that and the deal was to bowl a lot more slower.
We bowled wicket to wicket and we wanted to stop some of those shots. The plan was to bowl straight and bowl it slower. We tried changing the field and then slowed the ball a bit and changed our lengths. Didnt try to do too much, but length and pace was important and it worked for us today.
Comparing the first ODI and the second Sandakan said, We batted well the last game, but they outplayed us totally. They had come prepared to play our spinners well. If you see, they didnt play straight to our spinners, they were always playing across and it paid off. That was good planning and we had to adjust today.
The Zimbabweans who came face to face with Sandakan for the first time couldnt fathom his deliveries.
I think they struggled to pick me off the hand. Every game I get, I try to do my best and get as many wickets as possible, said Sandakan who fell so ill that he could not train and was sent home thus missing the first ODI.
When you are playing after a long break, you need confidence. I was given a lot of confidence. I tried bowling the usual stuff and it all worked well for me.
Talking through the hat-trick performed by debutant Wanindu Hasaranga, Sandakan said, When someone is debuting he is under pressure. He managed the pressure well and bowled his googlies, flippers and leg-spin well. There was lots of support for him. Everyone needs a bit of support when on debut.
We didnt pick Sandakans deliveries - Cremer
Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer admitted that his batsmen failed to pick up the deliveries of left-arm chinaman Lakshan Sandakan which led to their defeat in the second ODI at Galle.
Our guys didnt pick him that well because he is a lot different to what we are used to. We havent faced a lot of him he was a bit of a mystery to us, said Cremer at the post-match press conference. They took enough runs off him but he just bowled the wicket taking balls and we gave him a few soft wickets in that middle period.
Commenting on debutant Wanindu Hasarangas hat-trick, the Zimbabwe captain said, To get a hat- trick on debut thats something special. He looked a little bit nervous when he started, its understandable but credit to him. He stuck at it and the skipper having faith in him to keep him on and to clean up the back end of the innings was excellent.
Defending the ploy of sweeps and reverse sweeps which the Zimbabwe batsmen failed to employ yesterday, Cremer said, Thought the wicket was a little bit different and we didnt adjust early enough. We should have hit the ball down the ground a bit more. Maybe we will stop playing those shots its just one of those things. At one stage we could have batted off the overs. 230 could have been a decent score but we lost too many wickets in the middle.
Looking ahead at the remaining three matches in the series, Cremer said, First we will have a look at the wicket I cant see too many changes to our team maybe change strategy a little bit. Have a look at Sandakan and those guys and see how we can play them. We will come up with a good plan and then hopefully it will come off in the next couple of games.
Cremer confirmed that left-arm spinner Wellington Masakadza who injured his ankle at practice had gone home and been replaced by 22-year-old right-arm fast bowler Carl Mumba.

Xi tells Hong Kong to get its act together
HONG KONG: A landmark visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Hong Kong left little doubt that Beijing views the city as a destabilising hotbed of unacceptable political dissent that must prove its loyalty, analysts said Sunday.
His three-day trip to celebrate 20 years since Hong Kong was handed back to China by Britain, culminated Saturday in a 30-minute speech warning that any challenge to Beijings control over the city crossed a red line.
That was seen as a salvo against a new wave of activists calling for self-determination or independence for semi-autonomous Hong Kong, concepts intolerable to Beijing.
Throughout the televised address, Xi played up Hong Kongs role in upholding Chinas national security and sovereignty, casting it as a potential breeding ground for instability that must be reined in.
It comes after major political turbulence in recent years which saw mass rallies calling for democratic reform bring parts of the city to a standstill for months in 2014.
Since then, a localist movement has emerged promoting Hong Kongs own separate identity as fewer young people see themselves as Chinese. Some in that camp want a complete split from the mainland.
The address laid out a very strong warning against dissenters, said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University.
Xis acting as a schoolmaster, warning there will be consequences if they misbehave, he added.
Xi also called on authorities to enhance education to raise awareness of Chinas national history and culture, alluding to the need to bring young people back into the fold.
By putting national security and education front and centre, Xi is pushing Hong Kongs new Beijing-friendly leader Carrie Lam to revisit two potentially explosive catalysts for social and political unrest.
The last attempt to implement a compulsory patriotic curriculum was shelved in 2012 after huge rallies by parents, teachers and students who feared it was Beijing brainwashing. Those protests were led by a then 15-year-old Joshua Wong, now an internationally known pro-democracy campaigner.
A proposed anti-subversion national security law also triggered massive demonstrations in 2003 over concerns it would lead to suppression of rights and freedoms. It has never been implemented.
If Carrie Lam does what Xi Jinping said, which is to relaunch the national education campaign and to draft a national security law, shes going to antagonise a lot of Hong Kong people, said Cabestan.
Xi appeared relaxed, almost disinterested at times, during a visit which included presiding over Hong Kongs biggest military parade since the 1997 handover.
But his demeanour did not reflect an absence of purpose. The South China Morning Post described his strategy as speak softly but carry a big stick, a proverb made famous by United States President Theodore Roosevelt to describe his approach to foreign policy. Xi avowed his commitment to Hong Kongs semi-autonomous status as concerns deepen that China is increasingly interfering in the citys affairs.
Yet Beijings foreign ministry on Friday declared the document signed by Britain and China which initiated the handover was no longer relevant.
The Sino-British Joint Declaration gave Hong Kong rights unseen on the mainland through a one country, two systems agreement, lasting 50 years.
Xi said there must be a better understanding and implementation of the semi-autonomous set-up, which he likened to a tree with deep roots. Its raison detre was to uphold national unity, he said.
The message is quite clear that one country towers over two systems, said Willy Lam, a politics expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. - AFP
