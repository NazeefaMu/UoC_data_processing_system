Sakkarang premieres
Dr Dharmasena Pathirajas latest cinematic masterpiece Sakkarang premiered at the Regal Cinema on April 22 under the patronage of Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka. Parliamentarians, art personalities and other dignitaries also graced the occasion.
Sakkarang is based on the namesake novel by Chamminda Welagedara, which was short-listed for the Swarnapustaka award. It is produced by H D Premasiri.
The plot is woven around villagers of once upon a time who led their lives with utmost commitment and dedication to dancing and medicine. Dr Pathirajas filming takes us to the entertaining ambience of nature, respect towards elders, harmonious family life and unscrupulous behaviour patterns of the nobility against the downtrodden.
In a slow pace, this visual narration narrates the vanishing rhythm of the traditional drummers and physicians. It starts with the 1918 civil war when the country was still under the British yoke.
In the good old Sinhalese days, the physician was a dancer as well. He was a guru by all mean. He was well versed in the drumbeats while he could save a mans life by chasing away evil spirits. On a different note, the nobility strived with wicked intentions of lust towards low-caste females.

Dont Get Played, Dont be a Patsy
Think about that for a minute.If youre the patsy, its not because you want to be.I mean who would want to be the chump.
Youre the patsy because you didnt know you were and you didnt know better. You didnt even know there was a game being played around you.
We see this in financial markets. Small investors thinking they can compete on an even playing field with the whales in the market.They think alls going well until.whumpthey get swallowed up.They didnt even know the edge that the whales had over them. The huge competitive and informational advantage that they had.
These games exist in all spheres of life.
I want to look at the areas where looking good matters. Which is almost every area of life. Think about dating, your career, getting good service in bars and restaurants. As a general rule, the more attractive you are, the better you do in these areas.
Savvy people know this and exploit this to their advantage.
Patsies have no idea about this rule or worse, they do know but choose to do nothing about it.
We like attractive people. We treat them better. We cut them more slack. We think theyre better.
We respect them more and take them more seriously. So imagine youve got a date.
A first date. You decide to wear some comfy clothes. You might as well be comfortable right If your date doesnt like you for you, theyre not worth it, right
Wrong. So wrong.
All youve done is not played the game and so reduced your chances of winning.
What have you lost Youve lost the chance of a good first impression and being taken as a contender.
Dont do this to yourself.
When I was the Chump
Ive been the chump before and it cost me dearly.
I went for Officer Selection in the British Army after university.
I thought I had it in the bag. After all, Id graduated from a top university with a good degree. Why wouldnt I get in
I thought I looked good, and anyway, wasnt that just a superficial detail My qualifications should have been enough rightI couldnt have been more wrong.
Looking bad in a profession where looking good is so important didnt help my cause. I was rejected and told I couldnt apply again.I was absolutely devastated.
This was all that I wanted to do for years.Now it was off the table. Id lost the opportunity forever.
What had happened
Looking back on the experience, I was utterly clueless.I didnt have the first idea about the value that the British Army places on personal appearance and even if I had done, Id no idea about what great personal appearance would have looked like.
Who was the patsy
Me.
Why does the Army place such a high value on personal appearance
Sharply ironed, well-fitting uniforms and highly polished shoes indicates that the wearer has a high degree of self-respect. It also indicates self-discipline because it takes effort to achieve.
High levels of self-respect and self-discipline help make you inspirational to others and this is a core foundation of being a leader in the Armed Forces.
Looking around, it was easy to see who were at the winners and the chumps at that Selection Board.
The winners looked patrician and authoritative in their dark, conservatively cut suits and immaculately polished English shoes.They knew how Army Officers dress and calibrated accordingly.
They looked like natural leaders.
The chumps, on the other hand, were dressed without any clue of these rules.Rules that werent hidden, but were just unspoken.Like etiquette at a golf club or a gentlemens club, you should just know what the rules are without anyone having to tell you about them.
If you know about them, then great.
If you dont, then you have an uphill struggle ahead of you.
Play the game.
Accept the natural law above.Next time you go on a date or an interview, look around and see who the winners are and who the chumps are.

Breathing Canvas
He brings an enchanting vividness to his works on canvas and proves he is an artist par excellence. Bodily curves of damsels let alone pure innocence of children are grasped by him in a magical manner and brought to canvas.
Was there a hint of sadness on a particular lasss face who had volunteered to pose for a rare portrait The artist responds with a smile, says it is his sheer imagination and not an actual posing by a female. I have reliance on him. His forte is painting the human figure to portray realism. Being a self-made individual, even as a child he has had guts to turn down a one-year scholarship offered by late Mudliar Amarasekara to his art school.
Jayantha Silva the eminent and versatile artist will be unveiling his twelfth art exhibition on May 6 at 8.30 am at the Lionel Wendt. The exhibition will continue on May 7 and 8 from 10am onwards. Daily News interviewed Jayantha with a view to understanding the true temperament of an artiste who is born with inventive abilities.
Q: How do you describe the artist in you
A. Well I think I was born to be an artist. Born to a Catholic family on Buddha Jayanthi day was significant and that was how my name became Jayantha.
A Buddhist priest who had written my Horoscope had said I would become an artist.
I was a mischievous lad while in school and my passion was drawing. Instead of drawing on paper I drew on walls and floor and annoyed my teachers.
When I was 10 or 11 years old I drew a nude just by imagination. Now as a matured person I myself wonder how I imagined and did that drawing with perfection.
I grew up to become a happy-go-lucky person. I loved to draw figures and was groomed as a figurative artist in time.
Q: About your forthcoming art exhibition
A. This is my twelfth art exhibition. It will be an extension of my earlier exhibitions and will have acrylic and pastel drawings and portraits of human figures. I fancy drawing children, old people and women.
Q: In your drawings of women or damsels you tend to hide the face of the individual. Also there seem to be a touch of sadness in these females faces.
A. I never intended to do it with a purpose. May be you got a point there. True temperament of an artist is blended with his works. Drawing figures of curvy ones is a passion of any figurative artist. However I also love to draw children and old people who are the most innocent ones in this world.
Drawing on canvas is like a meditation to me. Even if I start drawing something reluctantly, after some time I create a liking towards it and strive to do the best possible.
Q: How did you become a professional artist
A. It all began with a cake decoration. I had to oblige to one of my mothers friends request to do a cake decoration for her childs birthday. It was a horse-shoe having a horses face within. It came out well and my name was announced at the party. I was hunting for a job at the time. A person who was at the party who happened to be a big shot in the advertising sphere offered me a job at Zenith Ad agency. During my stint in the advertising field I became a disciplined and professional commercial artist. At the time I would draw even sceneries for requirements of my clients. Eventually I started my own advertising agency.
My passion for drawing figures loomed again after many years and now I resort to drawing figures with more aesthetic attributes.
Q: Do you find this as a lucrative indulgence How do you price your drawings
A. Yes of course. When I was preparing for my maiden exhibition Expressions in 2003 as a fresher I was encountered with this challenge of pricing my drawings.
I asked two people who were very much into the art scene to come and value my drawings. Lucky Peiris and Soma of Chamathkar fame came to Lionel Wendt to price-tag my paintings.
Before doing that Lucky said to me, Jayantha, you must be good but you a fresher in this sphere. Hence it will take time for value of your paintings to accumulate. I told him, Lucky, you price them according to your whims and I will be happy with that.
His lowest price was 12,000 rupees and highest was 35,000 rupees. I was astonished and felt at that instance, I am going to be an artist loved by people.
I sold about two thirds of my paintings at my first exhibition. Only two known people bought a painting each and the rest were taken by absolutely unknown people.
In Sri Lanka you get quite a lot of art lovers and collectors. They are from all social strata that cut across high net worth clients to ordinary people. The nicest thing is none of them bargain since they know the emotional benefit they are going to derive by possessing a particular painting.
There are regular buyers who call me and ask for new paintings. There is this mature person who collects nudes rich with aesthetic value.
Q: Is there any significance in Sri Lankan faces
A. Yes there is. I had a series of paintings called Smiles of Sri Lanka which was very much in demand here and abroad. Even I was inspired by these paintings.
I have held exhibitions in few other countries. I noticed the Sri Lankan smile as a unique thing. It comes from the heart. I draw children and old people to depict this innocence within.
Q: Is there a demand for lustful ones too
A. In Australia I found there is a demand for lustful ones. But I fancy drawing more artistic ones and local art lovers do value those to lustful ones.
Q: Were you inspired by any local or foreign artist
A. Never. However I admire works of Leonardo da Vinci, Picasso let alone our own Senaka Senanayake. Picasso was a fantastic figurative artist before becoming an abstract artist.
He at the helm of his career could draw a curvy line or a circle and sell it for millions.
He was not selling the drawings but his signature. This depicts the magic and stature of an artist.

Programmed to exist
Let me put some crucial thoughts down. Some of the noblest beings have done this in the past. What is the purpose of our lives Has it been pre-determined Or have we been set down upon this earth already programmed Or are we part of the vast evolutionary processes described by Charles Darwin
Where does God come in What about different religious perspectives, belief, disbelief and miracles How do they enlighten us What is the meaning of this wondrous existence I despair even before I begin to find the answers.
Unlike philosophers or religionists trying to find answers to universal problems, I merely wish to understand for myself. Is there rebirth Or do we go through one lifetime, given the one single chance in life to make or break it. Why was I born a Muslim Was it by choice, or that this profound experience will resolve things for me.
To my understanding, there is nothing that can explain and resolve the inequities in this world- the suffering that humans have undergone in the past, the existence of animals and creatures lower down the evolutionary scale. Why is there such an endless detour to eventual happiness
As a Muslim I am given to know that God knows all things and we with our puny understanding are all but ignorant. As the Sufis (spiritual masters) have reached the pinnacle of spirituality will tell us, it is the final absorption in God, in the Divine through first an entry into states of bliss and into a heaven that will be the ultimate revelation.
Prophets sent down to earth by God have brought revelations as guidance for humanity and revelations sent down to Prophet Muhammad, setting a seal upon all the earlier revelations and perfecting them.
Is this then the solution that has been and is available to the billions of beings which offers salvation to them all
The Sufis tell us that it is Love at its loftiest heights, Love that infuses all things that surely is the finale to such a grandiose play which describes our sojourn on earth. How long does it take finally - an eternity or many eternities

Bharatha Natyam Dance marks International Dance Day
The Indian Cultural Centre, High Commission of India, Colombo will be organizing a folk and Bharatha Natyam performances by the students of Natya Kala Mandhi at the Cultural Centre auditorium located at 16/2, Gregorys Road, Colombo 07 under the guidance of their guru Kalasuri Vasugy Jegatheeswaran on April 29 at 6 pm.
Kalasuri Vasugy Jegatheeswaran received her initial training in Bharatha Natyam under her mother Vijayalakshmi Shanmugampillai and later in India under Padmashri Adyar K Lakshman.
She has been teaching dance over three decades and produced several dance dramas and her students have presented several classical performances in Sri Lanka and abroad. In 1990 the Government of Sri Lanka conferred on her the prestigious title of Kalasuri for the service she has rendered in the field of dance.
Vasugy has been teaching at the Indian Cultural Centre since June 2005. She is also teaching classical dance at the Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya.
International Dance Day was introduced in 1982 by the International Dance Council (CID, Conseil International de la Danse), a UNESCO partner NGO, and is celebrated yearly, on April 29. The date is not linked to a particular person or a particular form of dance, although it's also the day when the French dancer and ballet master Jean-Georges Noverre was born. The main purpose of Dance Day events is to attract the attention of the wider public to the art of dance. Emphasis should be given to addressing a new public, people who do not follow dance events during the course of the year.
Every year, the president of the International Dance Council sends the official message for Dance Day which circulate in every country around the world.

How to Handle Difficult Times
Sometimes, life just wallops us against the head, deals us with such a blow that it takes our breath away.
A loved one dies, you lose a job, someone you care about gets sick, your car gets totaled, or hopelessness hits you.
What do we do when the world around us crumbles, when we cant seem to find a way out
The times when things are falling apart are exactly the best times to practice mindfulness and compassion. These are the times were preparing for, in a way, when we meditate regularly with mindfulness and compassion, during the non-traumatic times.
The times when the world is collapsing are the richest areas of exploration, and when we need the tools most.
So the way to work with these times is this:
Stay with the pain. Dont run from it, dont try to do anything about it, but face it with courage.
Stay with the bodily feeling, dropping below your story, and smile at it, be friendly with it, have the braveness to just be with it like you would with a friend whos hurting.
Do it in small doses if thats all you can handle. Do it with patience, noticing that your mind wants to run. Keep coming back, and youll earn trust in yourself to stay with the hard feelings.
Eventually, you see that the feelings arent so bad, that you can stay with them and the world wont end, that theyll go away like a passing cloud, that these feelings and thoughts arent you but just passing phenomena. Youll start to take them less seriously, see that theyre No Big Deal, hold them lightly, give them space in your mind.
When the world is falling apart, this is the time to practice.

Bullied parrot finds new confidence with 3D-printed beak
A palm cockatoo named Huizai  Chinese for Grey Boy  has gotten a new lease on life, thanks to the wonders of technology.
The parrot who lives in a Nanjing zoo in Jiangsu, China, was on the verge of losing its beak (and respect from its peers) until he was fitted with a new beak on April 17.
According to one of his keepers, Chen Wei, Huizai's beak started showing cracks after a fight with another parrot, but those cracks got worse and most of it started to fall off. Both Huizai's confidence and appetite were affected by the loss.
Chen told China Daily: The beak is very important to a parrot's appearance. Huizai knew that it was different from the others and gradually preferred to stay alone. Sometimes it even refused to come out of its cafe. Because Huizai was seen as less of a bird, its keepers started to worry about its health and decided to approach vets and researchers at the Nanjing Research Institute of Additive Manufacturing for help.
According to one of the vets, Cheng Wangkun, a 3D printing company offered to rebuild Huizai's beak for free, reported CCTV News.
Using another parrot of the same species and health status as Huizai for reference, the company was able to create a comfortable resin beak for Huizai.
Cheng told reporters that the surgery was performed under anesthesia and they were able to connect Huizai's original beak with the resin part with 11 bone nails. Mashable

Shah Rukh Khan's Fan Unfairly Branded a Disappointing Flop
When a Hindi film earns 71.50 crore ($10.5 million) in India and $7.7 million in the rest of the world in its first week, chances are that would be hailed by local media and the Bollywood industry at large as a pretty decent result.
Not so for Shah Rukh Khan, who is held, unfairly, to a rather higher standard in a stellar 22-year career which has generated nine movies that each grossed more than $10 million internationally and now 11 that have surpassed $10 million in India.
True, the expectations were higher for Fan, the Maneesh Sharma- directed thriller in which he plays a movie star and his 25-year-old look-alike fan. Even so, the opening week was the second biggest for a Hindi release in its home market this year trailing Raja Menons Airlifts 83.5 crore ($12.5 million). Produced by Yash Raj Films, the film has taken 76.5 crore ($11.5 million) in nine days and is already the ninth biggest of the superstars career in India, overtaking Chak De! India (2007) and My Name Is Khan (2010).
Yet there is carping from sections of the Indian media. Koimoi.coms Joginder Tuteja branded the Indian business a commercial disappointment as the film continued to go down during the weekdays after a weekend that had stayed flat as well as disheartening for all in the industry who were looking forward to yet another quality product and a money spinner from Shah Rukh Khan and Yash Raj Films.
Arguably SRKs expectations were more realistic than those of his fans and some commentators. Last week he told PTI the thriller is not a film that heartland audience will like. But we took a chance thinking hopefully they (audience) will like it, but they need song and dance.
Language is a barrier, not everyone watches English, Spanish film. So, when you make a film like this, you know the film is not going to be universal; the heartland people are not going to understand. I dont think anyone is hypocrite in this.
The film has raked in $2.1 million after its second weekend in the US and is yet to play in China, Japan, Turkey, Vietnam and Korea so there is plenty of upside. In a video post on Twitter TWTR -1.60%, the 50-year-old actor thanked his fans worldwide for their supporting, stating We are extremely thankful that you liked it so much because its a very different film. We never expected it to be embraced so lovingly and so universally. Thank you so much all around the world for liking it.
Fan faced minimal competition from the launch of Hindi crime caper Santa Banta Pvt. Ltd, which took an estimated 3 crore ($450,000) on Friday and Saturday after arousing the ire of some Sikhs who said the trailer and poster were offensive and defamed the Sikh community. Cinemas in Chembur, Sion, Mulund, Dadar, Juhu and Andheri were forced to halt screenings on Friday after protests led by Congressman Charan Singh Sapra, who had unsuccessfully petitioned the Bombay High Court to try to delay the release.
Co-produced by Viacom18 Motion Pictures and Cinetek Telefilms, the comedy directed by Akashdeep Sabir stars Boman Irani and Vir Das as detectives named Santa and Banta who are sent to rescue the kidnapped Indian High Commissioner in Fiji, with disastrous results. The co-stars include Neha Dhupia as Santas love interest, Lisa Haydon, Johnny Lever, Ram Kapoor, Vijay Raaz and Sanjay Mishra. Forbes

## Title: Why Dallas needed a new animal cruelty plan

Why Dallas needed a new animal cruelty plan
After Dallas firefighters extinguished a suspected house arson earlier this year, a malnourished pit bull with a brown and white face lay at their feet in a silent plea for mercy.
Her throat had been slit.
Firefighters surmised that whoever lit the house on fire was also responsible for the gaping, bloody wound across her neck.
They reported the throat-slashing and saved the dog, which they named Khaleesi after a Game of Thrones character. But the city has no idea how often this happens: Officials stumbling upon a case of animal cruelty during the course of their regular work.
Dallas will announce a plan to change that, as part of a broader effort to tackle the citys urgent loose and dumped dog problems.
Here are five things to know ahead of time:
1. Dallas has a pack of dog problems.
Loose dogs. Dead dogs. Abused dogs.
Dallas has myriad competing problems when it comes to animal services.
Hundreds of loose dogs roam parts of southern Dallas, while one particular area  rural Dowdy Ferry Road in the citys southeast  has become a dumping ground for animals, dead and alive.
Officials hope cracking down on animal cruelty can help with the other issues, too.
It all works together, said Kris Sweckard, director of code compliance.
2. One group will oversee animal cruelty cases.
A new group, which includes police, prosecutors and animal services workers, will be tasked with improving how the city reports and investigates animal cruelty cases, said assistant city manager Joey Zapata.
He hopes improved coordination will help Dallas track cases like Khaleesis, in which city officials come across instances of cruelty while performing other duties, such as responding to fires or domestic violence calls. That number could then be added to the nearly 4,000 animal cruelty calls the city gets each year.
3. Activists are raising a toast, but holding off on the good champagne.
Animal activists have been pushing Dallas to do more to address cruelty, loose dog and dog dumping issues for a while. This new group represents a major move in that direction because it assigns responsibility to specific people, said advocate Stephanie Timko.
The group will shine a light on a lot of the broken processes  or the lack of processes  that are in place for dealing with animal abuse, she said.
But she said the way Dallas handles animal cruelty needs to be, from the bottom up, completely redone. Ideally, shed like the Dallas police to create a specialized animal cruelty unit.
4. Former Texas Ranger Pudge Rodriguez is on board.
Also on Monday, city officials announced a Show Your Soft Side campaign. The effort, which originated in Baltimore, uses sports celebrities to persuade young people that torturing defenseless animals isnt manly. Its similar to what Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings did to combat domestic violence in 2013, when he launched ads saying real men dont hit women.
Participants include former Texas Ranger Ivan Pudge Rodriguez, Dallas Cowboys Zack Martin and Tyrone Crawford, 105.3 FM The Fan host Skin Wade, MMA fighter Justin Miller and FC Dallas forward Tesho Akindele.
5. Khaleesi is still looking for a home.
The pit bull firefighters found with her throat slashed is available for adoption through DFW Rescue Me.
The rescue group says the 3-year-old will follow you from room to room and loves belly rubs. For a dog with such a traumatic past, it says, she just wants to give and receive love. Dallas News

His capacity irreplaceable
Seven years from today, April 21, 2009, was a very emotional day for all those involved in the cinema and teledrama industry. Versatile legend of the Sri Lankan arts scene Tissa Abeysekara's funeral was held on this particular day. Another veteran artiste was present at the ceremony on that day. He is someone who is shaken by even the slightest incident but finds solutions to the problems using his vast sea of knowledge and was able to cope with matters despite the many hurdles which fell across his way. He was Abeysekara's closest ally from youth. They both held different opinions about many matters concerning the arts scene at times but this did not affect their friendship.
He who was able to withstand all the problems in life was quite shaken by the departure of his friend. He came to where I and Sudath Rohana were and questioned us on how Abeysekara's death occurred in a very emotional tone. He who had weathered the storm and served the local arts industry in abundance is another veteran and versatile artiste, D B Nihalsinghe. We too have to echo his words today. When I got the news that he has passed away I called Sudath to tell him about it. The first words Sudath uttered were the same spoken by Nihalshinge at Abeysekara's funeral. I too need to ask the same question as I kneel in front of his lifeless body. I will not elaborate on what a great and worthy artiste Dr D B Nihalsinghe is in this article. Seasoned actors Siril Wickramage and Swarna Mallawarachchi who started in 'Sathsamudura' or Suweenitha Weerasinghe and G R Perera who starred in 'Velikathara' know of Nihalsinghe's cinematographic and directorial skills more than me. Nihalsinghe dedicated a majority of his youth to uplift the local cinema industry during his stint at the National Film Corporation. At the end of the 1970s, he chose me to star in his 'Ridi Nimnaya'. This was a turning point in my career. Nihal ayya not only advised me on how to perform my role but he gave many pointers on how to train, use and enhance my acting skills. He had no shortcuts in his teaching. He had no intention of pleasing the viewers, VIPs or any other individual. He did not want to transform an actor like me into a superstar; rather he wanted to transform me into a 'good actor'. Learning, training, requirement, dedication, the ability to read and understand, behaviour on the sets etc were some of the aspects that went hand in hand with what he expected from a 'good actor'. He explained that if one manages to tackle these aspects, one would inevitably become a superstar. I believe that I have not yet managed to get even close to both. Whenever I encountered him, I learnt something new in life.
Nihalsinghe is an immortal character in our industry. Buddhism and many other religions note that all beings leave this life after a span. We have failed to recognize the value of this human being and too his existence for granted.
He believed that an artiste is second only to God. He valued his profession. He once felt that he was not treated professionally at an awards ceremony. Therefore he wrapped the award he had received at the same awards ceremony during the previous year and returned it to the committee.
He was not opposed to events which uplifted the Sri Lankan tourist industry and foreign investment like having the IIFA Awards in Sri Lanka. However he was greatly upset about the manner in which local artistes were treated at the event and wrote a piece criticizing the matter to one of the Sunday newspapers.
He has done yeoman service to the local film industry. Many others who took up the chairman post at NFC said that they will pick up where Nihalsinghe has left off. However that did not materialize yet. That is not because they did not have the need or lacked the capacity to do so. It is because of all the issue in the industry. It has become like a tangled web. Whenever we try to take steps to solve an issue, we seek his advice. He too had no qualms about advising us. I do not oppose building memorials for him but the greatest merit we do on behalf of him is by trying to untangle the web of issues in our local cinema industry. I hope that everyone in the country will realize how committed he was and how much he had sweated over in uplifting the local arts scene.

Sensitivity and creativity of Alun Lewis
A few months ago, I was in Wales as a visitor to a family known to us. Though I was aware of some of the Welsh writers of fame I could not get a glimpse of the best poets who were outstanding and influenced new trends in creative writing, perhaps globally.
The Welsh family members in turn paid a visit to us in Sri Lanka during the pre-New Year period. The head of the Welsh family gave me a precious gift.
It was titled as 'Collected Poems of Alun Lewis' about whom I wrote an introductory note in these columns sometime back. Now I am getting to know more about the poet.
As edited and collected by Cary Archard, collected Poems of Alun Lewis, which brings closer to Wales in the cross cultural process and from a wider perspective, the humanistic themes of a wartime poet who served as a soldier in India as well. Archard notes that it was an arduous task to collect all poems of Lewis. This was mainly due to the restless life he had spent. During the wartime, nearly all of Lewis' poems were written between September 1939 and January 1944, and practically all of them were written on active service. They were not simply a record of his war service, but a young man's struggle to make sense of all that was happening to him. To begin with, in his soldier training in England and then his journey closer to the theatre of war in India.
As Archald states, he was especially preoccupied with the conflict between the creative act of writing poetry and what he saw as the brutalising and destructive nature of soldiering. An example could be drawn as follows from the collection.
The poem is titled as 'Monologue'.Mother, will you come and kiss away my fear,Every night like this nightYes, I will come, my dear.Tomorrow - do not cry -Flowers I will bringAnd our secret lullabyIn your ears I will singNow sleep, hard shines the moon,And I must goYour narrow bed will soonBe whole with snow.
For Lewis, it is said that the gift of poetry was a heavy responsibility. He wanted to get things right in the sense of being true to that gift. It is believed that Lewis had consulted one of the leading poets of the day, Robert Graves, famed for his Greek Myths translated into English and original English poems written based on Greek sources. 'Nightingale' is one example.
In this compilation, the reader comes across three main sections. First, Lewis' maiden collection titled as 'Raiders'. Second, the collection titled as 'Ha Ha! Among the Trumpets: poems in Transit'. Third, 'Uncollected Poems'. The first section is subdivided into 1. Poems in Khaki 2. Poems in Love 3. Songs 4. On Old Themes.
The second section envelopes quite a number of poems written while serving in India. As a sensitive poet, he tries to observe and jot down the areas of an alien culture in places such as Bombay, Poona and Maharashtra.
Alun Lewis is no more. Some of his works have appeared later as posthumous publications. In 1946, 'Letters from India' (edited by Gweno Lewis and Gwyn Jones). In 1948, 'In the Green Tree', a collection of short stories appeared.

Psychic and Dreamy: The Lady of Shallot
Many a time I had been psychic during my life when later I realized they all link the power-story of the poem. Sometimes, the night moaned through every crevice of my heart yet someone very much alive, broke the spell.
The Lady of Shalott was bonded to someone she never met but waited in expiation only to end up in tragedy and disaster. Like her there are people who connect each other by some mystique power. Call it telepathy or by any other name but the spiritual power in these combinations, become real with maturity though young people brush them aside. Yet as youngster we did have vivid dreams and mine was an illusion of a handsome young stranger of no identity. It passed away but decades later when I was hanging my baby's diapers on a clothline, something happened. That day was bright and sunny where I could hear the birds sing upon trees when I spied an aircraft flying very high in the heavens which is very normal since I live close to the airport.
'What if the aircraft crashed' I thought.
That evening over the air (no TV then) I heard of a terrible plane crash that killed hundreds at the time I imagined. Was it telepathy or intuition. I am still wondering Perhaps Tennyson may have gone through this type of mystery or to be exact, telepathy.
Take note of this incredible thing that happened to my friend which she never expected. Call her Sathya (not real name) She is about my age and long given upon on romances or relationships. A happy contented woman when she faced this amazing person for the first time and instantly fell deeply in love with him. She found her spirit stirring like never before. Why it happened; how it happened is still a mystery.
He was unaware of her feeling when they met many a time and she kept it locked tightly in her heart being aware he could never respond. With her affection growing stronger day by day and near explosion Sathya became dejected, miserable and unhappy. Gone were her laughter and joy. They were seized by him without his knowledge. Yet he could read between lines but what was he to do She was a prisoner in her body and soul. Like the LOS, she had given her heart to this Prince.
Sathya is still struggling 12 and perhaps find her way to Camelot leaving behind Sir Lancelot whom she loves dearly, very dearly.
'And down the river's dim expanse
Like some bold seer in a trance
Seeing all his mischance
With a glassy countenance.
Did she look to Camelot
To round up this human tragedy. Tennysn wrote an epitaph from his other poem.
'This better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all'
EPILOGUE
Among multitude of readers, many have come across fictitious characters especially in poetry that resembles many events or happenings in our lives or even having our identities. It is at pensive moments they strikes us. Could be from childhood, adulthood or even later. Then suddenly we realize how very close to resemblances, emotionally or otherwise we have been carried to. Dream-poetry often plays tricks where tragedy or happiness besiege one and many. To top it all, dreams connect us on such barren stage and make us its players giving life to such characters. It may sound a bit philosophical but in every man's life, philosophy plays its part unwittingly. The thinker analyse such a situation but the down-to-earth man, brush them all aside. He who interact with life's realities are such ones. With time racing against us, we have little time to pause and ponder. Can they arise from a poem, stanza or from a little literary gem
As we sail down this winding river of impossible visions. Imagination or even hallucinations, the human mind is found to be gripped by such framework which is the reason we are totally different to beasts who too are born with feelings just like human beings but pushed against nature to survive with lack of brains or mind and rendered helpless, often at the mercy of us all if they step out of their abodes. Literally we find ourselves in other people's personalities or guises. We imitate them unaware that such things are happening and get deeper into such complexes where others notice our change while we carry on regardless. As a teenager I found myself completely in the role of Lady of Shalott. I still do not understand why or how I got involved; how I was influenced and what made me seep into her. Of course, every teenager dreams her prince charming come riding by on a white steed or something to this effect. It is the time of youth but dreams disappear with time.
A life is trapped with no explanation by the poet, beautiful and tragic, she is made a victim of fate which leads us to imagine whether Tennyson was a psyche Possibly dwelling in his thinking-power that assess the character built upon The Lady of Shalott. She is psychic, a force assumed to explain the medium of psychology.
In the ghastly tower around which the landscape stretch, poised against the grey skies which she is not suppose to see but listen the reapers reaping barley as they sing throughout the day. Through grey haze of the heavens, the tall trees sweeping by reflected in her mirror, makes her sick and weary.
The Curse
She was aware of the curse set upon her through which she to die the moment she looked down to Camelot. She had very little life left. It was a matter of time when death would come riding by
Hoofbeats clattered on the winding roadway to Camelot. She winced as the horse galloped in the sunling. The nightmare had not ended. It was the beginning to eternity if that is where the boat was heading with her afloat. She left behind the casement window that forbade her to look down to Camelot as in patience she waited for Lancelot. The dormers beneath the window spread in wild profusion as the river circled her tower. The high castellated turrets rose into the afternoon sky which the Lady of Shallot hardly noticed as she lowered herself into the boat with the feel of the curse on her. A powerful sensation was moving towards as the bare Birch trees sped fast against the boat.
Yes; she had seen Lancelot just once and experienced a disquieting phenomenon. She knew the time was nigh; Lancelot was riding towards her and the rest through to Camelot while others continued, he paused a while to take a look into the boat.

Unprecedented crowds expected at UNP May Day rally

An unprecedented crowd is expected at the UNP May Day rally at Campbell Park, Education Minister and UNP Deputy General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
Addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday, the minister said the May Day procession of the UNP would commence at Maradana at 11.00 a.m. and reach Campbell park via Punchi Borella and Borella.
He said as the President of the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya, he held discussions with the Trade Unions over the preparations of the May Day rally, adding that there was so much zeal and enthusiasm among them.
Kariyawasam said those against whom there are myriad charges of corruption, bribery and fraud were attempting to use the Kirulopane rally as cover for their wrong doings. He stressed the government would defeat their attempts.

JO rally begins from Shalika grounds as planned

The Joint Opposition May Day rally will start from Shalika grounds as planned, leader of the Joint Opposition and Mahajana Eksath Peramuna Dinesh Gunawardena said.
While vehemently condemning the cancellation of the permit issued to use Shalika Grounds as the commencementpoint of the Joint Opposition May Day rally, the MP said: This is the work of an invisible hand to scuttle the efforts of the Joint Opposition.
Addressing a media briefing at N.M.Perera Auditorium yesterday, he said the rally faced such a hindrance because it is the only anti-UNP May Day Rally that is being organised.
The democratic mask of the Yahapalana government was detached with this anti-democratic action taken by them. We are saddened that the Joint Opposition had been denied the right to use Shalika Grounds at the last minute although prior reservations had been made, Gunawardena said.
He noted that Field Marshal Sarath Fonsekas party was allowed to use Shalika Grounds last year for their May Day Rally although the government claims that it is the first time that a party had requested to use the ground for a May Day Rally.
However, the May Day procession of the Joint Opposition would commence at Shalika Grounds as previously planned and end with a rally in Kirulopane Grounds despite the cancellation of the reservation of Shalika Grounds in Narahenpita, Gunawardena said.
He also condemned the cancellation of the May Day rally of the Samurdi Association which itself proves the cowardliness of the government by trying to suppress the voice of the public worker.
While stressing the fact that the Kirulapona May Day rally would be one of the most successful rallies held in history so far, Gunawardene said the public burdened by the excessive taxation by the government, along with a number of professionals who are against the ETCA agreement would mass at the Joint Opposition May Day Rally signifying the highest participation. When questioned whether President Maithripala Sirisena had been invited for the rally, Gunawardena said that since it is an anti-UNP rally they are not expecting to put anyone in trouble.

Plans to scuttle JO rally: Wimal

National Freedom Front leader Wimal Weerawansa said news has been received from reliable sources that there are plans to scuttle the May Day Rally of the Joint Opposition by an organised group.
Addressing a media briefing at the N.M.Perera Auditorium yesterday, he said the governments planned obstruction of the Joint Opposition rally demonstrates its fear for the Joint Opposition rally and their first step was to cancel the reservation of the Shalika Grounds in Narahenpita.
Weerawansa said numerous efforts are being made by the government to collect crowds for their rally while spending a huge sum.
Last year Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Devasiri was sent to the Joint Opposition May Day Rally along with a group of men wearing blue T shirts who themselves assaulted him. Therefore, we request Nirmal Ranjith Devasiri not to come to our May Day Rally to create a political drama, he said.
Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) spokesman Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Devasiri, was assaulted near the Lalith Athulathmudali Grounds in Kirulapone, the venue of the Joint Opposition May Day rally last year.
Weerawansa also said the government had violated democracy by appointing Heads of Government Departments according to their own whims and fancies.
These heads of departments nod like lamp posts to any decision taken by the government, he said.
Even though the Constitutional Council (CC) is called to have made independent and fair decisions we did not experience it either in the appointment of the Attorney General or the IGP. Although the historical tradition is to offer the post to the most senior officer among all, the CC did not follow that procedure on the last two occasions, he said.
The new IGP Pujith Jayasundara himself stated that the Head of the Police FCID Division has been appointed by the President and the Prime Minister after considering many factors correctly. However, the CC or the IGP has the power to appoint the Head of Police FCID. This statement itself proves that the government is in the process of making the FCID as an instrument for a political witch hunt, he said.

Unprecedented crowd expected at Kirulapona rally

Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga yesterday said that an unprecedented crowd will participate in the May Day rally organised by the Joint Opposition in Kirulapona. He said the May Day should not be used for political purposes.
It is a day in which the working masses demand their rights from the government, he said. Ranatunga said they will support if an UPFA government is formed after May Day as announced by the UPFA General Secretary.
He was speaking at a press conference held at former President Mahinda Rajapaksas Office in Battaramulla yesterday
He said the government has curtailed facilities provided to the public service. The forces that brought this government into power are not happy with what the government is doing now, Ranatunga added.
He said doctors, farmers, police and and tri forces personnel are disappointed over the governments activities. Ranatunga said the working masses masses can only be won through struggle.

Unions to file FR against Education Minister

The Collective of Unions for Protecting Education will file a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court on the alleged granting of appointments and promotions on political grounds by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam to several persons who have not passed the Sri Lanka Education Administrative Service, Teachers Service, Principal service and Teacher Educators Service exams on the pretext that they have been politically victimised.
Sri Lanka Education Administrative Service (SLEAS) Union Media Spokesman Neil Athukorala addressing the media yesterday in Colombo, said this is totally against the Constitution on the Education Administrative Service.
The Public Administration and Home Affairs Ministry has already sent a list of 4,500 names to the Education Ministry and if this done in a transparent manner, we urge the minister to publish these names on the ministry website. We have held a protest campaign against this move opposite the Education Ministry recently but Minister Kariyawasam said this is a sabotage action of the Joint Opposition. This is being done while moves are on the way to select the qualified candidates to the education sector after the competitive examination this year, he said.
Civil Society Activist Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Dewasiri said it is regrettable that the government service is being used for political purposes. Education will suffer a setback when unqualified persons are recruited to the education service in the guise of redressing political victimisation. If there are political victimised persons, proper investigation should be held and solutions found without resorting to actions like this. Usually, only highly qualified people who have passed interviews conducted by the Public Service Commission are recruited to the education administrative service, teaching service and principal service.
Most in the list have been interdicted as they have engaged in fraudulent acts, political canvassing and some anti-social activities during working hours. Among them are many who have not passed the relevant exams as well, he said.
If the Education Minister is not doing anything wrong, he should come for an open debate and clarify the issue, Dr. Dewasiri said.
