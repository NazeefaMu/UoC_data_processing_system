No ballistic missiles at N. Korean parade
NORTH KOREA: Thousands of North Korean troops paraded through Pyongyang Sunday as the nuclear-armed country celebrated its 70th birthday, followed by artillery and tanks, but it refrained from displaying the intercontinental ballistic missiles that have seen it hit with sanctions.
Instead leader Kim Jong Un showed off his friendship with China, raising the hand of President Xi Jinpings envoy as they saluted the crowd together afterwards.
The Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, as the North is officially known, was proclaimed on September 9, 1948, three years after Moscow and Washington divided the peninsula between them in the closing days of the Second World War.
Such set-piece dates are a mainstay of the Norths political calendar, particularly when round numbers are involved, and have long been occasions for showing off its latest hardware.
But too militaristic a display might have risked upsetting the recent diplomatic dalliance on the peninsula, after Kims Singapore meeting with US President Donald Trump in June and his third summit with the Souths President Moon Jae-in due in Pyongyang later this month. After a 21-gun salute, dozens of infantry units marched through Kim Il Sung Square, some in night-vision goggles or wielding rocket-propelled grenade launchers, as the current leader -- the founders grandson -- looked on from a rostrum. Li Zhanshu, one of the seven members of the Chinese Communist partys Politburo Standing Committee, the countrys most powerful body, sat next to him, the two of them occasionally exchanging comments.
Armoured personnel carriers, multiple rocket launchers and tanks followed, with biplanes flying overhead in a 70 formation. At one point jets trailing red, white and blue smoke -- the colours of the North Korean flag -- roared above the Juche Tower, the stone monument to Kim Il Sungs political philosophy. Finally came the missiles, the traditional climax of the parades. But the only ones on show were the blue Kumsong-3, an anti-ship cruise missile, and the Pongae-5 surface-to-air weapon.
There was no sign of the Hwasong-14 and -15 missiles that can reach the mainland United States and changed the strategic balance when they were first tested last year.
It looks like the North Koreans really tried to tone down the military nature of this, said Chad OCarroll, managing director of Korea Risk Group.
There was no display of ICBMs, IRBMs (intermediate-range ballistic missiles), which would really not have sat well with the whole idea that North Korea is committed to ultimate denuclearisation. So I think it will be well received. Immediately after the parade thousands of citizens walked through the square, escorting floats displaying economic themes and calls for Korean reunification. - AFP

Non vegetarian!
A guest on the British show, This Morning, was left utterly embarrassed after her dog she said was vegetarian chose to eat meat over greens on live TV.
Lucy Carrington, chose to put her white Siberian husky Storm, on a vegetarian diet when she started to loose interest in her food during the heatwave over the summer in the country.
She bought Storm meat-free dog foods and even let her eat the familys leftover vegetables. Lucy claimed it helps perk her up.
On the show, Storm was given a choice of two bowls. One of them included meat and the other had vegetables.
Confident Lucy was sure her husky was going straight for the vegetarian option, but Storm didnt even look at it and surprised everyone by enjoying the bowl of meat.
Some viewers reportedly criticised Lucy for putting her on a limited diet and called it animal cruelty.
Others had a bit of a laugh at the womans expense. Mirror

Oil spill clean-up operations in progress
A leakage in a fuel pipeline from the tankers to the Muthurajawela Oil Refinery Complex was reported in the Uswetakeiyawa area on Friday night.
A Ceylon Petroleum Corporation team (CPC) on patrol visit observed the leakage on Saturday morning and immediate steps were taken to bring the situation under control, Petroleum Ministry Secretary Upali Marasinghe said.
Due to the leakage, an oil spill was identified in the beach area from Dikovita to Uswetakeiyawa, while efforts to clean the sea area by removing the fuel spill are being carried out with the support of Sri Lanka Navy, Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Ltd., Marine Environment Protection Agency and the Coast Conservation Department, he said.
Over 300 naval personnel attached to the Western Naval Command and Coast Guard joined the cleaning up operation with the support of Sri Lanka Coast Guard ships Samaraksha and Samudra Raksha, which were presented to the SLCG by the Japanese Government on August 29.
According to the Secretary, the CPC has incurred a loss due to the leakage. He said an assessment in this regard will be carried out.
According to Marasinghe,a new pipeline is being laid replacing an old one and 90 per cent of the construction work has been finished.
The rest of the construction work is expected to completed by years end, but a group of illegal dwellers in the Mahawatte area, beside the railway track from the Colombo harbour to Kolonnawa are protesting against the project.
Currently, we are in discussions with them to settle the problem, Marasinghe further added.

Osaka's US Open win: rare good news in disaster-hit Japan
TOKYO, Sunday - Japan on Sunday hailed Naomi Osaka's stunning upset against the legendary Serena Williams to win the US Open, giving the nation some rare good news after a summer of deadly natural disasters.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe led the praise, taking to Twitter to congratulate Osaka after her 6-2, 6-4 win in New York.
Congratulations on your victory at the US Open. The first Japanese player to win a Grand Slam title. Thank you for giving energy and inspiration to the whole of Japan, the premier tweeted.
Abe was on his way to the northern island of Hokkaido where a massive earthquake last week sparked landslides that buried houses in a rural town, killing at least 35 people and injuring hundreds of others.
Osaka's grandfather Tetsuo Osaka, 73, lives in Hokkaido and said he wept watching his granddaughter on television.
It still hasn't sunk in for me yet. The moment she won, my wife and I rejoiced together. I was so happy, I cried, he told public broadcaster NHK.
I hope she stays healthy and continues her good work. I also hope she wins at the Tokyo Olympics (in 2020), he said. Fellow tennis star Kei Nishikori flooded Twitter with emojis of trophies, thumbs up and Japanese flags, followed by a simple tweet of proud alongside a Japanese flag.
And Tsuyoshi Fukui, a former top Japanese player and now senior official at the Japanese Tennis Association, said Osaka's performance would help to cheer the country up after typhoons, floods and earthquakes dominated the headlines this summer. Osaka's tenacious and patient performance ... must have been a great show of encouragement to those Japanese people who saw damage from such things as typhoons and earthquakes, Fukui told Japanese media.
Meanwhile, NHK took a break from its round-the-clock coverage of the disaster to turn to happier news.
Osaka wins women's US Open, becomes first Japanese to win Grand Slam, blared the broadcaster's top headline.
Sports Nippon newspaper said Osaka had achieved a complete victory against an irritated Serena who broke her racket. The Asahi Shimbun daily said on Twitter it would be printing an extra edition and distributing it in Tokyo.
PRIDE OF JAPAN
The final will probably be remembered for a meltdown from Williams who called the chair umpire a thief as much as for the 20-year-old's historic win. Williams's tantrum overshadowed an outstanding performance from Osaka, who made her second career title a Grand Slam after winning her first at Indian Wells in March. Osaka has dual Japanese-American citizenship and often replies to questions from Japan's media in English, apologising for not knowing the appropriate word when she speaks Japanese. After earning $3.8 million (3.29 million Euros) for the victory, Osaka said her next goal was a simple one: to win her next tournament in Tokyo.  AFP

Delay in road rehabilitation
Panadura UC blames RDA, UDA
Panadura Urban Council Chairman Nandana Gunathileka said the Road Development Authority (RDA) and the Urban Development Authority (UDA) are carrying out a poor road rehabilitation project in Panadura.
He was addressing the monthly meeting of the council on September 6 at the Council Auditorium.
The RDA commenced the work on the Panadura old Galle Road from the Panadura-Walana Junction to the Moratguwa-Digerolla Bridge, a distance of five miles, a three years ago but it is not complete to date.
The other projects by the UDA had not been completed as well, he said.
The delay was brought to the authorities but the situation has not changed, he said.
The Panadura Depot and the Western Province Road Development Authority are in a conflict over the removal of the SLTB short distant buses to the Panadura New Private Bus Stand from the Panadura SLTB Central Bus Stand, he said.
He said he met Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka in this regard and he would call for a meeting of the relevant authorities to resolve the conflict.
Gunathileka said tuition places paste posters on walls of the Panadura SLTB building and opposite the Panadura New Private Bus Stand.
Narcotic dealings are seen at the two bus stands. A person is manning the public lavatory at the Panadura Central Bus Stand without paying a cent to the SLTB, he said.
A shed is set up at its entrance but the SLTB officials are silent about the issue, he said.
He said councillors must join development programme that the government will carry out in Panadura shortly.
The Chairman said many families lived on State lands in Panadura but they do not have deeds for them.
They cannot admit their children to the Grade I classes since they cannot submit deeds, he said.
UNP Councillor Anura Wijepala tabled a resolution on the thema geetaya he composed for the Panadura Urban Council.
Anura Wijepala was praised for composing the song and the Council requested him to produce the song before the next Council meeting amending its several wordings.

PM Proposes Trade adjustment package for private sector
The Cabinet has approved a trade adjustment package to help the private sector, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Speaking at the Most Admired Companies 2018 event held at the Shangri-La hotel, he said a Cabinet paper to give effect to this was approved in principle and will be sharpened with private sector participation.
The Premier explained that Sri Lanka is faced with a huge tax burden and in 2019 over Rs 1.7 trillion is to be settled. The PM said the Hambantota Port, the Mattala Airport and the Puttalam power plants alone had resulted in the government having to pay back Rs. 1.7 trillion.
Thanks to the lease arrangement with China, we have now managed to take the financial burden of the Hambantota port. Next we will have to go in for a private-public partnership agreement for the Mattala Airport as well, the PM said.
He said that today due to high debt servicing, more tax had to be paid by the private sector.
This tax structure study was prepared with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund.
However, we are now in the process of reviewing this tax format and there would be incentives that would be introduced soon, the PM said.
Wickremesinghe also said that Sri Lankans economy is not being properly focused and the time has come to change it. Sri Lanka should focus from being an economy engaged in non-tradeable sector to a tradeable sector.
Sri Lankas merchandise exports dropped from 33 percent in 2000 to 13 percent in 2017 and the country must concentrate on more exports again. In contrast, Bangladesh merchandise export earnings increased from 12 billion to 35 billion in the same period.

Porter overpowers Garcia to claim vacant WBC world title
NEW YORK - Former champion Shawn Porter defeated Danny Garcia by a unanimous decision late Saturday to win the vacant World Boxing Council welterweight title.
The 30-year-old American won on all three judges scorecards as he threw more punches overall, but Garcia made it razor close by landing a higher percentage of punches at the Barclays Center arena in New York.
It turned out to be a terrific 12-round, 147-pound slugfest as two judges had it 115-113 while the other scored it 116-112. The judges agreed on only four rounds.
Porter solidified his position as being one of the best welterweights in boxing's deepest division.
This title means a lot to me, said Porter. It means a lot to the history and I wanted to be part of that. He is hoping this victory lands him a chance to avenge a loss to unbeaten Keith Thurman, or a unification fight with Errol Spence.
Porter bulled his way through the fight, coming straight ahead and smothering Garcia with jabs and body shots to improve his record to 35-1 with 20 KOs in front of the crowd of 13,000.
He tried to out hustle me mostly at the end of the rounds. His hustle game was up tonight. I did my best to fight from the outside and the inside, said Porter.
Garcia made his made his mark in the division with brilliant counterpunching skills, but he also had his left hook working well against the fellow American as the two traded rounds throughout most of the fight.
Garcia suffered just the third loss of his career to go with 28 victories.
I thought I won this fight, said Garcia.
Porter beat Devon Alexander in 2013 for the International Boxing Federation welterweight title and defended that crown twice before losing it by majority decision to Britain's Kell Brook in 2014.
Garcia beat Mexico's Erik Morales for the WBC super-lightweight crown in March 2012 and took the World Boxing Association version of the crown from Britain's Amir Khan four months later. He spent two years ruling the division before moving up in weight.
In 2016, he beat Robert Guerrero for the WBC welterweight crown but lost it last year to Thurman in a split decision at Barclays Center. Garcia last fought in February, stopping Brandon Rios.
Thurman needed right elbow surgery after beating Garcia, and suffered a bruised left hand last March in training for his next fight.
He vacated the WBC crown in April, setting the stage for Garcia to face Porter with the winner a possible next foe for Thurman, 28-0 with 22 knockouts.

Total foreign purchases increased by 7.47% W-o-W to LKR 0.65Bn from last weeks value of LKR 0.60Bn, while total foreign sales amounted to LKR 0.71Bn relative to LKR 1.37Bn recorded last week (-48.19% W-o-W). In terms of volume, Tokyo Cement & Richard Pieris led foreign purchases while Dialog & Distilleries led foreign sales. In terms of value, HNB & Lion Brewery led foreign purchases while JKH & Dialog led foreign sales.
Point of view 
Sri Lankan equities continued the positive momentum created last week as the benchmark index gained 38 points or 0.62% during the week.
The news of the potential return of the EPF to equities boosted sentiments last week and early this week. However, protests against the government by joint opposition created some political tension and the market also reacted with a 8 point loss on both Wednesday and Thursday.
Despite this, the Broad Market Index regained 108 points, recovering from its 17-month low of 6010.23 points last Tuesday. Consequently, YTD loss on ASPI reduced to 4.6% cf. 5.2% loss till last week. Despite the recovery in the Index, Activity levels remained dull throughout the week and the maximum daily turnover of Rs.0.4Bn (recorded on Monday) for the week was also lower than the YTD daily average turnover of Rs.0.8Bn. Following the protest, on Thursday daily turnover hit a 5-month low of Rs.0.1Bn since April this year.
Local HNI and Institutional investors remained inactive during the week as crossing for the week accounted for only 30% of weekly turnover (cf. 42% last week and YTD average of 40%). Lion Brewery dominated the bulk parcel purchases with 53% of the total crossing while HNB accounted for 22%. The foreign equity sell-off on the Colombo bourse meanwhile eased as foreign investors recorded a net foreign outflow of Rs.64Mn during the week cf. Rs.771Mn outflow last week. Markets in the week ahead are likely look for cues from economic and political development.
Domestic and global pressures push LKR down 5% 
In its latest Sovereign Credit overview for the APAC region, Fitch Ratings noted that although Sri Lankas policy framework has improved and supports both macroeconomic stability and rising government revenues, high government debt and a challenging external debt servicing outlook remain risks to the sovereign.
Fitch noted that although Sri Lankas projected debt service payments are significant at $15Bn in 2019-2022, its foreign-exchange reserves as at Jun18 was just $9.3Bn highlighting the countrys vulnerability to external financing pressures particularly in the context of rising US rates. Fitch estimates that GDP in 2018 will grow to just 3.8% before improving to 4.5% percent in 2019 while Government debt as a % of GDP should fall to 75.9% in 2019 (cf. 77.6% currently). The Agency noted however, that progress has been made on critical fiscal reforms (including the approval of an automatic fuel price mechanism effective May 2018) while steps have also been taken to introduce an automatic electricity pricing mechanism and establish a committee to develop a detailed restructuring plan for Sri Lankan Airlines.
However, it noted that deteriorating policy coherence and credibility could compromise investor confidence or derail the IMFs EFF program and thus lead to external funding stress.
The Group added however, that 1) further improvement in external finances (through higher non-debt-creating inflows or a reduction in external sovereign refinancing risks from improved liability management) and ii) continued improvement in public finances on the back of a credible medium-term fiscal strategy remain positive sensitivities for the Sovereign.

Pre-Budget Forum 2019 organized  by University of Sri Jayewardenepura
The third-year undergraduates of the Department of Business Economics have organized a Pre-Budget forum focussing on export competitiveness on September 17th at 3 pm at the Lighthouse Auditorium of the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies. The keynote speech will be delivered by State Minister of Finance, Eran Wickramaratne. The aim of organizing the forum is to provide a platform for small and medium scale exporters to discuss the difficulties they face and present solutions and alternatives to enhance the competitiveness of exports.
In 2017, Sri Lankas trade deficit was US$ 9.6 billion, up from US$ 8.8 billion in the previous year. Sri Lankas exports were US$ 11.3 billion, up 10.2 percent from a year earlier and imports increased by 9.4 percent to US$ 20.9 billion. This shows that Sri Lanka has a trend of increasing trade deficit. The solution being to either reduce imports or increase exports. Reducing imports is easier said than done as nobody wants to enjoy a standard of living less than what was enjoyed earlier. Most imported items are essential as they cannot be produced locally. This leaves increasing exports as Sri Lankas only option.
Increasing exports is vital for Sri Lanka to address its severe trade deficit. Therefore, it is essential that Sri Lanka promotes export-oriented industries and enhance the competitiveness of the industry. The government often tries to promote exports and provide benefits to exporters. The National Export Strategy introduced by the Export Development Board is one such policy framework. However, such policies are not communicated to small and medium scale exporters unlike the large-scale players.
Many small-scale exporters face difficulties and have no means of communicating the issues, difficulties and suggestions since there is no proper platform for the purpose. However, small and medium scale exporters also play a major role in Sri Lankas export earnings and have the potential to become larger players in the international market given a conducive environment and policy framework to operate.
In certain countries, the value of exports by small scale players exceeds the value of exports of all the larger players. This alone shows that it is vital to give a keen ear and lend a helping hand to small scale players.
Policy adjustments conducive to the export industry should be introduced, such as rebates on taxes paid on imported raw materials for products that are exported. Such a policy would be extremely beneficial to local producers as most of them are involved in value addition of imported raw materials as in the textile and steel industry.
Small scale exporters with a plan for expansion should be funded and advised as needed and a direct link with the policy makers is crucial at this juncture. Government institutions that have a stake in exports should be proactive and respond quickly in keeping with the needs of the industry. Policy consistency in terms of taxation and tariffs is also needed as sudden shocks may cause these small and medium scale exporters to go bankrupt and out of business.
The government at present is giving a positive attitude and support for entrepreneurs while encouraging entrepreneurship which is indeed commendable. A similar positive attitude and support for exporters can play a major role in their performance which at the end of the day will boost Sri Lankas export earnings and government revenue.
Another option is to cluster industries so that the waste of one industry can be used to produce goods that could be exported. With Sri Lankas move to higher income earnings and a qualified workforce, the country can look to export knowledge-based industries, mainly in the fields of Information Technology and Knowledge Process Outsourcing, which is the fifth largest foreign exchange earning industry at present. This has the potential to be a major revenue earner for the nation.
The Pre-Budget Forum will encourage exporters to hear what the policy makers have to say, acquaint themselves about the National Export Strategy and listen to the address by officials of the Inland Revenue Department and Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
This will be followed by an open discussion. This forum is the first of its kind and an ambitious project by the undergraduates who strongly believe that they can contribute to the national economy.

OMP Interim Report recommendations
President to appoint Cabinet Sub-Committee
President Maithripala Sirisena has said he would appoint a Cabinet Sub-Committee to look into the urgent recommendations included in the recently released Interim Report of the Office of Missing Persons (OMP).
The OMP established to address the many cases of missing and disappeared, handed over their Interim Report to the President last Wednesday at the Parliamentary premises.
The Interim Report among others recommends interim measures to provide relief and reparation to the affected families by the disappearances of their loved ones, OMP Chairman President Counsel Saliya Peiris, responding to the Daily News said that pending the investigations and justice done for the disappeared, the most immediate issue the missing persons families are undergoing is the economic hardships.
When we handed over the Interim Report to President Sirisena, he assured us and the diplomatic community that he will put these recommendations before a Cabinet Sub-Committee, Chairman, PC Saliya Peiris said.
Peiris further said that many of the consultations done by the OMP with the families of the missing, it was revealed that the most urgent problem faced by these families is poor economic conditions. In addition, the OMP interim report has observed that The current socio-economic situation of many families of the missing and the disappeared is dire and cannot wait until a final reparations scheme is devised. In the interim, a key set of measures is required to provide urgent and immediate relief to the families.
Many families of the disappeared are economically affected by the disappearance of their loved ones. Sometimes, the disappeared had been the breadwinner of the family. It maybe the children who have disappeared and their aged parents need support. There are single parents whose partner has disappeared. Most of these persons are in debt.
Accordingly, these persons should be incorporated in to a relief programme, OMP Chairman PC Peiris pointed out. While stressing the importance of addressing the economic difficulties faced by the families of the missing persons, Peiris emphasised that what is most important is doing justice for those who are missing or disappeared. This is not to say for a moment, that justice should be ignored, he added.
Under the relief proposals by the Interim Reort, OMP has suggested to launch a debt relief programme to the families of disappeared. As a part of these recommendations, the OMP has suggested that the government provide loan facilities to those families through Enterprise Sri Lanka to improve their living standards.
The recommendation further that these families should be included in a priority category in a debt relief programme that would either write off debts such as micro finance loans or in a financial aid programme or loan scheme.
The OMP has also suggested that these families be given educational and housing development aid as well. As a part of a financial aid programme, the OMP also suggests to implement a programme to provide a monthly living allowance of Rs.6,000 to the surviving spouse, child/children and/or surviving parents of a missing or disappeared parent who has no permanent income, until the final reparations are provided.
The Interim Report has been compiled taking into account the investigations carried over the past six months.
Meanwhile, Finance Ministry Secretary Dr.R.H.S.Samaratunga responding to Daily News on the same topic said that they will be able to further on the recommendations for debt release and financial aid programs when the matter would be taken up by the Cabinet.

Cultivation of barren paddy land
President, chief guest at confab today
The National Farmer Convention on the Cultivation of Barren Paddy Fields in Sri Lanka will be held today under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena, at Ruhunu Magampura International Conference Hall.
According to the Ministry statistics, there are around 140,000 acres of barren paddy lands in the country and more than 114,000 acres of barren paddy fields can be effectively used for paddy cultivation.
The Agrarian Development Department (ADD) which is under the purview of the Agriculture Ministry has already taken measures cultivate 26,000 acres of barren paddy lands.
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said that the Ministry has taken a firm decision to encourage the owners of barren paddy fields to cultivate the total extent of paddy lands in the 2018 Maha season.
If they fail to do that, the Ministry has decided to provide these paddy fields to the Sri Lanka Army, Civil Defence Force or youth who are willing to cultivate these lands.
This decision will not affect the ownership of the land.
The ADD has already made the paddy fields owners aware this decision, he added.
The Minister said 2018 Maha paddy harvest should increase since most of the districts will receive sufficient water from the Moragahakanda - Kalu Ganga project.

President intervenes to solve drinking water crisis in Anuradhapura
President Maithripala Sirisena has intervened to resolve the problem of scarcity of drinking water in Anuradhapura and has instructed the Anuradhapura Government Agent to take prompt action in this regard.
The water level of the Nuwarawewa reservoir has dropped significantly causing a scarcity of treated drinking water to a population of around 300,000 in the Anuradhapura and Mihintale cities and their suburbs.
Adhering to the directive of the President, Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake convened an emergency meeting recently where the top executives of the Anuradhapura district Irrigation Department, Water Supply and Drainage Board (WSDB), Archaeology Department, Mahaweli Authority and the relevant divisional secretaries participated.
WSDB (NCP) Regional Manager C.S. Lokubarana said that the water crisis is worsening since no adequate rainfall could he expected until mid-November.
Due to the dwindling water level of Nuwarawewa, the water has got mixed with sediment making it very difficult to be treated, officials said.
The Mahaweli system H residential project manager Udaya Kalyana Kumara said that the water capacity of the districts largest reservoir - Kalawewa - has dropped to 37,000 acre feet from 110,000 acre feet.
They required 5,700 acre feet for cultivation within the Mahaweli H area.
It was disclosed at the meeting that although it was the agreement that the water level of Nuwarawewa should not be allowed to drop beyond six feet, that standard has not been adhered to.

## Title: The Prevalence of Ritual

The Prevalence of Ritual
On October 6, 1964, at the height of the American civil rights movement, fifty-three-year-old Romare Bearden, a mature artist with a moderately successful career as a painter behind him, debuted nearly two dozen billboard-size, black-and-white, photographic enlargements of collagesProjections, he called them. Instead of the large abstract work he had been painting up to then, he filled his canvases with the faces of black people. Their expressions, unflinching and intense, dominated crowded city streets, southern cotton fields, and ecstatic rituals. Spontaneous passions seemed to erupt from these works, filling the walls of Cordier-Ekstrom, Beardens gallery on the Upper East Side of New York.
Some called his creations a sign of the turbulent times: the 1950s Montgomery bus boycott and Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling; 1960s lunch counter sit-ins, freedom rides, the March on Washington, and the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, the year of Projections. A surge of civil rights activism swept the country, compelling an urgent need for change. Figures in Beardens Projections embody that urgency, confronting their viewers like characters in a play caught in mid-action. At first glance the figures in Projections look ordinary, as if the artist were merely reporting a news event, except faces are fractured and dislocated, their hands swollen to twice their normal size, bodies pieced together from startling juxtapositions, including, as one commentator notes, parts of African masks, animal eyes, marbles, corn and mossy vegetation.
History of distortions
Grotesque might be too harsh a word to describe some of the figures in the Projections. Yet they evoke a history of distortions of black life even as they also re-envision that life. Beardens friend Ralph Ellison used the word disturbing to describe the figures in the work; their stridency, he noted, was completely out of character for an artist who, until that exhibition, was not known for representations of race. Why did Bearden so emphatically and comprehensively change the style and subject matter of his art
Bearden himself steadfastly rejected political explanations of his art, even Projections. Yet, his lifehis childhood, coming of age, and emergence as a major artistintersected squarely with a battle over representation. It was not a new fight, for it had started in the aftermath of the Civil War and become a proxy for a violent and desperate war in the public, social, and legislative spheres over who enjoys the rights and privileges of citizenship. Before the Civil War, American citizenship flatly excluded slaves, the status of the overwhelming majority of black people in the New World. Emancipation and the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments radically changed that status. Theoretically, they defined, and should have safeguarded, citizenship rights for newly freed slaves. To celebrate and record and, most of all, project their newly acquired identities, black Americans often turned to self-representation, to photography.
Henry and Rosa Kennedy, Beardens great-grandparents, proud of their new citizenship status, understood the affirmative documentary value of photographs. An enlarged photographic image of them (probably taken in the 1920s) hung on the wall of Beardens studio. Former slaves, the Kennedys had become prosperous landowners and entrepreneurs after the Civil War in Charlotte, North Carolina.Romie, as he was called, was born in their home on September 2, 1911. The photograph shows the Kennedys sitting on the porch of their home. Rosa Kennedy looks into the camera with almost open defiance. Bearden did not discover this photograph until he returned to Charlotte years after the 1964 debut of the Projections. Nonetheless, he replicated her fierceness in the faces in Projections. He captures the same quality of interior life present in this ancestral photograph. As sociologist Robin Kelly observes, early photographs often captured the interior life of Black America, the world either hidden from public view or forced into oblivion by the constant flood of stereotypes.
Documentary photography
By the time Bearden was constructing his collage paintings in the 1960s and then blowing them up into black-and-white enlargements, film, television, advertising, journalism, and documentary photography were standard bearers of beauty and fashion, symbols of mainstream American cultural identity, and acting as sales pitches for everything from televisions to politicians. With the advent of the Internet and social media in the twenty-first century, the potency of visual cultures reach only continued to grow.
Bearden insisted that his workpaintings and collageswas neither propaganda nor sociology. During his life and after his death, his reputation has rested primarily on his collages, a blend of visual memoir and emotional realism that evokes a rapidly disappearing past. When I was a graduate student, he wrote me a letter in which he explained the phrase he has used for images of the past in Projectionsthe prevalence of ritual: My paintings cant be only what they appear to represent.
People in a Baptism, in a Virginia stream, are linked to St. John the Baptist, to ancient purification rites and to their African heritage. I feel this continuation of ritual gives a dimension to the works so that the works are something other than mere designs. - Paris Review

Prosecuting University student criminals
The incident reported in the Daily News of September 3 that a group of lawless law student thugs had subjected the lady Principal of the Law College to the horrible experience of being held hostage for nearly 23 hours, is the latest expression of the longstanding malady of campus violence in Sri Lanka. It is a malady that is more commonly seen in the persistent culture of ragging (a misleading euphemism for the systematic torture of new entrants). In the case of this particular incident it is scandalous that there should be such contempt for the law amongst those who are aspiring to be the future lawyers and judges in this country!
As a former Dean of a Faculty, with a record of relentless hostility to such perversities I would like to reiterate the absolute imperative of charging the offenders under Sections 4, 5, and 6 of the Prohibition of Ragging and Other Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act No 20 of 1998 where following conviction after summary trial - hostage taking and wrongful restraint are punishable with up to seven years rigorous imprisonment.
Higher education authorities
This Act No 20 of 1998 was enacted 20 long years ago. That followed the murder of an Engineering student Varapragash by fellow students who forced him to exercise violently until the poor boy died of kidney failure.
However it is a poor reflection on higher education authorities that seemingly no student has ever been charged and punished under the provisions of this Act since that time although the abomination of student violence, contempt for law and order, rampant indiscipline and the systematic torture of new entrants continues to rage in our campuses. It has been suggested that this might be partly because given the culture of fear in campuses victims of violence are terrified to testify in court against their oppressors.
However in the present case where a very senior lawyer who is the Principal of the Law College was taken hostage by student criminals whom she would obviously be in a position to identify  there should be no impediment whatsoever to rigorously enforcing the rule of law so that the offenders are both expelled from the Law College and after summary trial given the maximum punishment of seven years RI under the Anti Ragging Act of 1998. Indeed if there was any serious commitment to the rule of law in the country, this ought to be what they call an open and shut case!
Bureaucratic procedure
This is no time to follow dull bureaucratic procedure and passively await the reaction of the governing authorities of the Law College to this incident. To be sure as a general principle individual victims of lawlessness may sometimes possess a kind and gentle nature that is disposed to be tolerant and indulgent towards those who have harassed them personally. On the other hand where such individuals occupy public office it would not be right for them to allow such personal sentiments to conflict with their public duty to rigorously bring criminals to justice, whose violence in this instance is the latest expression of a degenerate culture of student violence, indiscipline, arrogant contempt for the rule of law, and the persistent torture of new entrants that has been the bane of our Universities for decades, taking a heavy toll on successive generations of students many of whose lives have been irrevocably scarred as a result.
In a lifetime of struggle against campus violence and torture I have often been disillusioned by the weakness and apathy of university authorities and academic staff in addressing the malady of student violence and indiscipline. I have no doubt that if there was sufficient moral outrage in the academic community towards these evils they can be eliminated forthwith.
Any failure to prosecute the offenders in this latest incident with the full force of the 1998 Act and put them away, will be a further indication of the lack of such moral outrage, with the implication that a degenerate culture of violence and torture has now come to stay and will continue to be a permanent feature of higher education in Sri Lanka.

Bilateral series against Indian Women starts at Galle tomorrow
Ranking is only a number I am confident of winning - Chamari
Sri Lanka Women cricket team captain Chamari Atapattu said that rankings dont mean a thing and that she was confident her side would put up a good contest against India in the upcoming three-match ODI series and five-match T20I series.
The ODI series commences at Galle on Tuesday.
Answering a question at the media conference held at Jaic Hilton on Saturday what kind of challenge eighth ranked Sri Lanka can pose to India who are ranked three, Chamari replied: Any team that plays well on that day will win. If you take the rankings when we went for the 2013 World Cup we were ranked 8th but we defeated India, England and South Africa and Harsha de Silva was our coach on that occasion. I believe ranking is only a number. If we perform well on the day we can beat any team. I am confident we can do that.
Speaking further Chamari said: We need to improve our batting skills because we tend to struggle against spin. We cannot make the changes overnight but over time with new coach (Harsha de Silva) we can achieve it.
De Silva who has returned as coach of the womens team after five years in Australia said that his work has been made easy because out of the pool of 24 players at least 20 were there in 2013 when he last handled them.
It is a big advantage to me because I had worked with these girls before. I could see a lot of talent skill wise and there is a lot of talent to work to take them forward. We have done 3 weeks of training for this series and I am extremely happy with our preparations, said De Silva.
Giving reasons for returning as coach De Silva said, I was away in Australia for 5 years and once you have been in a high performance environment after a while you come to start missing the environment you were in before. Thats why I thought I make a comeback not only to undertake womens cricket I was open for any high performance team to take. This is a great opportunity for me to get into the system again and take it forward.
Indian womens captain Mithali Raj said that she was positive about the performances of her team on the field.
We have played Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup and World Cup and we feel that it is a team that has grown from year to year. Now the gap between top teams and bottom teams are narrowing because of the ICC championship tournaments, said Mithali.
Pointing to Chamari, Mithali said, You do have a player representing Sri Lanka in the Big Bash League that itself shows that you have a very strong team. We are looking forward to gaining as many points as we can in this bilateral series as ICC qualifying tournament points are crucial for both the teams. - ST

It also benefits the communities of the Kuchchaveli area and makes them the key players in the supply chain for the upcoming hotels in Kuchchaveli. One of the successful hotels operating in the area is the 15-acre Jungle Beach Hotel by Uga Escapes which has 95% occupancy rate during the high season.
To generate more direct and indirect employment opportunities in the area, SLTDA has also planned a model fishing village in Kuchchaweli as 40% of the local community in the area are involved in the fisheries sector.The proposed village is expected to attract tourists seeking authentic and unique tourism experiences in Sri Lanka.
Countries from several regions including Nepal, Peru, Vietnam, Uzbekistan, Myanmar, Ethiopia, Laos, Cambodia and Mongolia took part in the Korean forum.

Sri Lanka  Retail Forum  on October 17
Sri Lanka Retail Forum, has now become the nations leading retail sector forum has returned for a second consecutive year, and registration for the forum opens today (September 10).
Owing to the overwhelming success seen at the forum held last year, with 450 participants, the Sri Lanka Retailers Association (Guarantee) Ltd. (SLRA) is organizing the forum once again.
This years theme is Towards a Dynamic and Evolving Retail Sector and is scheduled to be held from October 17 to 18, 2018 at Cinnamon Grand Colombo.
The SLRA is the sole industry body for this sector, representing nearly 40 leading and national level retail firms, with countrywide reach across various product segments.
Sri Lanka is adopting an open strategy to trade, with the recently implemented National Export Strategy, and signing of FTAs, therefore local retailers not only need to gear up for emerging challenges, but they need to take hold of the opportunity of going-to-market.
Fresh strategies of increasing competitiveness and opening up to the global market is essential, which is the thought behind this years theme. The Forum brings together the front-runners of both the local and international retail industry, sharing their insights and leading deep-dive discussion on strategies that Sri Lankan retail companies can adopt and further build on, to sharpen their processes from supply chain management to customer services, etc.
The discussions will have a synergistic effect  inspecting from various angles the shortcomings of the industry at large, and suggestions of how they can be tackled from individuals who have already achieved success in the industry.
The forum will focus on four thematic sessions: reshaping customer engagement, driving tomorrows retail today, new models challenging the status-quo  brands-culture-sustainability, and where retail in the region is heading. These sessions will explore tools such as data analytics, sustainable practice, a tourism  retail nexus, and digitization strategies. E-platforms for retail and how the industry can evolve into the digital ecosystem will also be a key discussion at the forum.
A dynamic and evolving retail sector should be a device that Sri Lanka can boast of as contribution to its economic growth, and this will establish the goods and services of local companies as superior products in the global market. The goal in which the forum is held is that Sri Lankan Retailers will learn strategies that will boost their performance, the performance of the industry, and ultimately the performance of the whole nation, said Charitha Subasinghe, Chairman of the Organizing Committee of Sri Lanka Retail Forum 2018.
This forum is ideal for those keen on learning new trends and innovations in the retail industry, and it will cover a wide range of challenges and new insights across the 4 thematic sessions that will be held over the course of two days. Registrations are open until October 15, 2018.

## Title: Unexpected Health Benefits of Gardening

Unexpected Health Benefits of Gardening
Its no coincidence that gardens aimed at interactive health and healing have been popping up in prisons, hospitals, nursing homes, and in community centers for homeless populations and at-risk youth. It turns out that deep sense of well-being you get from an afternoon weeding and pruning isnt all in your head.
1. Stress-relief and self-esteem
A Dutch study asked two groups to complete a stressful task. Afterwards, one group gardened for 30 minutes, while the other group read indoors. Not only did the gardening group report better moods than the reading group, they also had measurably lower cortisol levels. Cortisol, the stress hormone, may influence more than just mood: chronically elevated cortisol levels have been linked to everything from immune function to obesity to memory and learning problems and heart disease. It may be more than brain hormones causing higher self-esteem scores for gardeners: theres no more tangible measure of ones power to cause positive change in the world than to nurture a plant from seed to fruit-bearing.
2. Heart health and stroke risk
Gardening may be just one way to achieve your target 2.5 hours of moderate-intensity exercise each week  but gardening provides a rewarding motivation that makes it happen, unlike a treadmill, which invites associations with hamsters in wheels. A large Stockholm study showed that regular gardening cuts stroke and heart attack risk by up to 30% for those over 60.
3. Hand strength and dexterity
As we age, diminishing dexterity and strength in the hands can gradually narrow the range of activities that are possible or pleasurable. Gardening keeps those hand muscles vigorous and agile without oft-forgotten exercises such as a physiotherapist might prescribe. Related research has inspired rehabilitative programs for stroke patients involving gardening tasks as a satisfying and productive way of rebuilding strength and ability.
4. Brain health and Alzheimers risk
One long-term study followed nearly 3,000 older adults for 16 years, tracking incidence of all kinds of dementia and assessing a variety of lifestyle factors. Researchers found daily gardening to represent the single biggest risk reduction for dementia, reducing incidence by 36 per cent. Another study estimated the risk reduction at 47%! Why does gardening make such a difference Alzheimers is a mysterious disease, and the factors influencing its incidence and progression remain poorly understood. However gardening involves so many of our critical functions, including strength, endurance, dexterity, learning, problem solving, and sensory awareness, that its benefits are likely to represent a synthesis of various aspects.
5. Immune regulation
This one is a wild card. Not only does the Vitamin D youre soaking in from the summer sun help you fight off colds and flus, but it turns out even the dirt under your fingernails may be working in your favor! The friendly soil bacteria Mycobacterium vaccae  common in garden dirt and absorbed by inhalation or ingestion on vegetables  has been found to alleviate symptoms of psoriasis, allergies and asthma: all of which may stem from an out-of-whack immune system. This particular organism has also been shown to alleviate depression, so go ahead and get your hands dirty. Researchers are still speculating how our immune system may interact with our brains and play into a variety of mental health issues in addition to our ability to fend off infection: inflammation may provide the key link.
6. Depression and mental health
Professional legitimacy to anecdotal claims, the growing field of horticultural therapy is giving proven results for patients with depression and other mental illnesses. The benefits appear to spring from a combination of physical activity, awareness of natural surroundings, cognitive stimulation and the satisfaction of the work. To build the therapeutic properties of your own garden, aim for a combination of food-producing, scented, and flowering plants to nourish all the senses. Add a comfortable seat so you can continue to bask in the garden while you rest from your labors. Letting your body get a little hot and sweaty might also have hidden benefits: as devotees of hot baths and saunas can attest, elevated body temperatures are also correlated with increased feelings of well-being. Dont forget to drink plenty of water and know your limits. eartheasy

Religious perspective
United in devotion
Almost 20 km away from the Jaffna city, lies the quiet little village known as Atchuvely Thoppu, which is off the main Raja Veethi. The road itself holds significant memories for 90-year-old Eliathamby Sangarapillai Master, who as a young man back in the day, played a pivotal role in having this road developed into a main road.
A short distance from the main Raja Veethi in the midst of open farmland, stands an ancient little temple dedicated to God Ganesha (Pillaiyar) which has served as a place of worship for the people of this village for many decades.
The Thiruvilla (annual) festival of the Atchuvely Thoppu Bodhi Pillaiyar temple commenced on August 26 and concluded with the water-cutting ceremony on September 4. The Chariot Festival was held on September 3 amidst a large gathering of devotees from near and far. This year was of special significance for this temple as it received a large pond which is a significant feature at ceremonies of a Hindu temple. All these years, the Thoppu Bodhi Pillaiyar Temple held its water-cutting ceremony at a small well within the temple premises.
This Temple is dedicated to God Ganesha. Ganesh (also spelt Ganesa or Ganesha and known as Ganapati, Vinayaka and Pillaiyar) is the Lord of Good Fortune who provides prosperity, fortune and success. He is the Lord of Beginnings and the Remover of Obstacles of both material and spiritual kinds. Interestingly, he also places obstacles in the path of those who need to be checked.
Devotees believe that if Ganesha is worshiped, he grants success, prosperity and protection against adversity. In a lesser known role, Ganesh is also the destroyer of vanity, selfishness and pride.
According to Sangarapillai Master, who had gained his initial education at the Atchuvely Central College and later served as Master in charge of English at the very school for over two decades, Bodhi means enlightenment and Ghanesha is the god of knowledge. The temple was founded several hundred years ago and at the entrance to the temple, there is a large Bo-tree which was planted by him many years ago while he was a young man. I tried to find a Bo-tree from several places including Colombo and Kandy to plant at this temple but failed. However, one day when I was praying at the temple, and when I suddenly looked up, to my surprise, I spotted two Bo-saplings on the top of the shrine enclosure. I was delighted and saw it as a sheer miracle, as I had found a Bo-sapling to plant at the temple. I quickly got a ladder and carefully extracted the two Bo-saplings, and planted one at the BodhiPillaiyarTemple and the other at the MeenadchiAmman Temple. Today, I have returned to the country after many years and seeing that Bo-plants grown into huge trees, my heart is filled with joy.
Having served as the Master in charge of English, Discipline Masterand Bicknel House Master at the Atchuvely Central College, he was called to serve as the Head of the English Department in Barewa College in Nigeria. After 12 years of service in Nigeria, he and his wife Rajeswary eventually made Canada their home. Despite his achievements, Sangarapillai Master is a humble man who lives a modest life in devotion to his religion and helping others. He has been bestowed with a gold medal by Queen Elizabeth for his writings and community work, Sangarapillai Master has helped many underprivileged students achieve success in education and in fact, his students having heard of his arrival in Jaffna, had made the trip to the Bodhi Pillayar Temple as a mark of respect for their beloved Master.
Although Sangarapillai Master lives in Canada, he never forgot his homeland and to date, even his pension is sacrificed for the welfare of the widows and orphans due to the war. The Atchuvely Bodh Pillaiyar Temple was renovated after many years, but something was still missing, which was a pond. Having taken it upon himself to construct a pond for the temple, Sangarapillai Master had donated 50 perches of his land bordering the temple for this purpose. Not stopping at that, he wrote to the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and requested for funds for the construction of the tank for which he received Rs. 100,000 from the Ministry.
He also initially donated Rs. 500,000 for the construction of the pond. Eager to make her contribution in her own way, Sangarapillai Masters loving wife Rajeswary had been silently collecting her own savings to be donated to the temple at the time of the opening of the pond. However, it was so unfortunate that she took ill on December 31, 2017 and on January 01, 2018 peacefully passed away at the Scarborough General Hospital in Canada. Refusing to be held back by his age and the difficulty in travelling such a long distance from Canada to Sri Lanka, Sangarapillai Master made his way to his hometown, Atchuvely on September 3 to attend the temple ceremonies and the opening of the temple pond. He was a past President of the Temple committee and even though he lives in Canada, has been very involved in all the activities of the temple as an advisor to the current temple administration. At the ceremony, he donated the funds collected by his wife and the donation of his nephew Tulasidas Sivanesan completing his contribution to the construction of the temple pond to around Rs. One million, in addition to the land donated for this purpose.
The Temple Committee also honoured Sangarapillai Master with a special Silk Shawl (Ponnadai) and garlanded him, presenting him with a plaque as a token of appreciation for his service.
I am 90-years-old and I have lived my life in service to my people and to many students of around 24 nationalities during my service as a Universal Teacher. My only wish from God now is to be able to conduct my wifes one year ceremony after her demise and I have asked God to call me to rest soon after. I know I will not be able to come back to Sri Lanka again. I am proud to be a Sri Lankan and I will never hesitate to say it. But I must admit Canada has treated me well and from here on, I have entrusted my eldest son Sangarasayto take on the mantle from me and continue to serve the temple and his community at Atchuvely, said Sangarapillai Master with great emotion.
The festival of the Atchuvely Bodhi Thoppu Pillaiyar Temple surely served as a sign of acceptance and reconciliation between the Northern and Southern people as it was attended by many from the South including military personnel together with their families. The Jaffna Security Forces Commander, Maj. Gen. Dharshana Hettiarachchi graciously assigned his staff to provide all assistance required for the festival as he was unable to attend the ceremony due to official obligations.
As a true teacher would, Sangarapillai Master rendered special thanks to the military for their efforts in ending the war and also for their service to the people of the North. In conclusion, having handed over the funds to the President of the temple committee Dr. Rajalingam, the young temple committee members carried their loving Master to the newly constructed temple-pond for a dip in the water signifying the opening of the tank which would serve the temple for many years to come, where the water-cutting ceremony of the temple would be held from here on.

Asia Cup no guarantees of winning
We have the potential and players to beat any side  Mathews
With two days to go before the Sri Lanka team embarks to Dubai for the Asia Cup fifty-over cricket tournament doubts still lingered on the fitness of batsman Dinesh Chandimal and off-spinner Akila Dananjaya.
Sri Lanka are due to leave on Tuesday but captain Angelo Mathews was left with the task of knowing whether two of his key players will be with him or not probably by today.
Dananjaya is delaying his departure to be beside his wife who is expecting their first child while Chandimal is fighting to get fit after sustaining a hairline fracture on the middle finger of his right hand during the recently concluded domestic T20 league.
Akila is not certain for the first two matches and Chandi is working with the physios and doctors and a final confirmation of his availability will be known today or tomorrow, said Mathews.
The format of the tournament is such that Sri Lanka or any of the other five participating teams  Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Hong Kong will need to win their first round matches to have a chance of qualifying for the second stage. Failure to do so would mean an early exit from the tournament. In that context Dananjaya who has bowled Sri Lanka to victory in the recent ODI series against South Africa plays an integral part. His absence for Sri Lankas first two games against Bangladesh on September 15 at Dubai and Afghanistan on September 17 at Abu Dhabi will be greatly felt. Veteran off-spinner Dilruwan Perera more renowned for his bowling in the Test circuit has been included in the 16 to take Dananjayas place.
CONFIDENCE BOOSTER
Mathews is confident that his team has the potential and the skill to win against any side.
Even though we have not won a series for quite some time the way we finished the South African series was a confidence booster, said Mathews.
Sri Lanka lost the first three ODIs to South Africa but bounced back to win the next two and the one-off T20I to regain their morale in one-day cricket where they have not fared well at all in the past one and a half years or so.
Theres no guarantee that we can win the Asia Cup but if we play to our potential we have the skills and the players to win against any side provided we do well in all three departments, said Mathews.
We cant take Bangladesh and Afghanistan or any team for that matter lightly.
This is a tight tournament where the margin of error has to be very minimal or you could find yourself out of the tournament after the first round. The team that marginalizes its mistakes to a minimum will win, he said.
RETURN OF MALINGA
A lot of focus on the Sri Lanka team and in the tournament will be on the return of legendary one-day fast bowler Lasith Malinga to international cricket after a year in the wilderness.
Malingas had his ups and downs in a chequered career and at 35 finds himself with a chance to bowl himself back into contention for the 2019 World Cup with a stellar performance in the Asia Cup.
I back Malinga to the core. He can deliver on a big stage although he hasnt played one-day cricket for some time. We picked him after only playing in a T20 tournament because he has the skills. I have the fullest confidence in him, said Mathews.
My opinion is that this is a big tournament. All the players have been asked to play in domestic tournaments to be eligible for selection that is the selection policy. Although Malinga did not take many wickets we should not judge his performance purely on that. We need to look at what situation he bowled, and how he bowled. He bowled extremely well and he was very economical. He bowled his yorkers at the death. More than the wickets we also have to look at other factors as well, he said.
EIGHT CORE PLAYERS FOR WORLD CUP
With the World Cup barely eight months away Mathews said that they had identified a set of eight players who would make the core of the team. The others can be juggled around depending on the conditions and the opposition.
One of the most debated issues has been the inability of Mathews to bowl. The Lankan white ball skipper who recently went to Brisbane to seek advice on his troublesome legs that has prevented him from playing consistently for his country said, We are working backwards from the World Cup and trying to get myself to bowl at least by end of the year. Presently I want to play as a batsman and contribute as much as I can. I know how important my bowling is to the balance of the team because we can always play an extra batsman or a bowler.

A welcome decision
President Maithripala Sirisenas decision to go all out to weed out ragging in the universities, no doubt, would be welcomed by all right thinking citizens of this country. Cruel forms of ragging are often reported in the media but other than some noises being made by those in authority and drastic action threatened against the perpetrators the matter is allowed to die down and it is back to square one. Today our universities have fallen to the level of veritable torture chambers where parents dread to send their children.
By the Presidents own admission the necessary laws are in place to deal with this menace but had not been implemented since they were enacted in 1998 when the late Richard Pathirana was the Education Minister. It is strange indeed that in the face of inhuman ragging in the universities, which had resulted even in deaths, why these laws continued to remain dormant. Speaking at a ceremony to launch a Vocational Training Institute at Hingurakkgoda, the President said he had instructed the university authorities and law enforcement agencies to file charges against university students involved in ragging, adding that the government would not allow extremists to destroy the future of the new students. He noted that although there were laws to punish those found guilty of ragging, the laws remain unused and ineffective. He said those involved in ragging were not concerned about the future of their victims who are harassed and suffer physically and mentally. There were instances where ragging victims committed suicide or die from the inhuman treatment inflicted by the seniors. This must be stopped once and for all, he asserted.
No doubt, ragging in our universities has reached monstrous proportions unlike in the past where initiation of freshers to the university environment were done by the seniors in a civilized fashion albeit with the usual grilling. Nay, ragging today is done for sadistic pleasure by those segments who carry a chip on their shoulders due to social inferiority or other complexes in character stemming from their particular social backgrounds or class origins, according to studies carried out on the reasons for inhuman ragging in our universities. The studies also found that a majority of this sadistic ragging is engaged in by students in the Arts stream, hailing from the villages, and whose lives had been marked by poverty and other forms of deprivation.
Hence, it would also be appropriate for the authorities to go deep into the root causes of ragging of the type that is witnessed today in our universities where youths whose characters are marked by insecurity give vent to their frustrations in the form of sadistic conduct.
Like the President said, a handful of students should not be allowed to play with the future of the majority who look forward to build their lives with a sound education that could only be ensured in a condusive environment. Sadly, our universities today are known not only for inhuman ragging but also radicalization of youth for causes that are destructive. Campuses today have been turned into hot-beds of radical politics where youth have embraced doctrines that can only spell ruin for their future. Due to these reasons parents today are reluctant to send their children to our universities, the affluent among them preferring to educate their offspring abroad, instead. Upon completion of their higher education these students are bound to settle down in those countries which will avail of their talents and expertise, exacerbating the massive brain drain Sri Lanka is confronted with.
In addition there are also countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand which have opened the doors to Sri Lankan students where they are given the opportunity to work and study in their countries which again will be to the detriment of this country at a time the President is extending invitations to Sri Lankan professionals domiciled in the west to return to their motherland and employ their skills for the countrys development.
Hence, measures should be taken to retain what is left of our experts, and, what is more, the budding professionals that will be produced by our universities. This can only be done by an assurance from the authorities that our universities will strictly remain centres of higher education and not places where inmates give vent to their sadistic tendencies. Therefore, the need to strictly implement the law against those sabotaging the education of our youth, instead of merely confining it to the statue books, cannot be overemphasized.
Of motions and loose motions
Parliament where motions are passed routinely for the passage of Bills was to see a different type of motion being discussed, the day following the JO janabalaya demo, where MP Wimal Weerawansa accused UNP Colombo District MP Mujibur Rahuman for causing loose motions among some of the participants, due to supporters of the latter distributing contaminated milk packets to the crowds. Now, it is reported that Rahuman is planning to take the loose motion accusation to court- another domain where motions are often presented by legal counsel.

Armys right-sizing programme grossly misinterpreted
The Sri Lanka Army responding to recent criticism of its security preparedness by some retired Army Officers, said it had taken all necessary measures to prepare the Army for any eventuality.
Issuing a statement, the Army said their recent right-sizing programme, had been grossly misinterpreted and misunderstood.
Nine years have passed since the Sri Lanka Army victoriously completed the near 30-year long brutal war. During that 9-year period, four experienced Commanders maintaining the highest level of battle-preparedness have commanded the Army while introducing various training modules and exercises to that effect which are being more refinedly continued to-date.
Likewise, all measures have been adopted uninterruptedly to introduce new training modules at all levels for all ranks, incorporating the most modern techniques of warfare, based on experiences, gained in the battlefield in order to face any future battle threat perception. Similarly, necessary measures have been adopted comparatively to enhance more opportunities to both Officers and Other Ranks to receive foreign training slots with state patronage. This has further broadened their knowledge on international warfare, too.

Army will be further strengthened
The Army assured that training modules will be introduced at all levels for all ranks with modern techniques of warfare, based on their experiences of the battlefield to face future battles.
Officers and other ranks will receive foreign training with State patronage broadening their knowledge on international warfare.
The Army said it is not ethically right for someone to review the status quo of the Army and its battlefield preparedness from outside after having gone on retirement years ago. It questions someones moral right to hurl such allegations as well.
Former Commanders and retired officers were consulted when training programmes are introduced and the Army would continue such practices unfailingly in future, as well.
The Army urged intelligent people to repose their confidence in the Army which has defended the country in the past, and is committed to do so in future as a professional outfit preventing any resurgence of warfare.
Nine years have passed since the Army won the 30-year long war. During that period, four experienced commanders have commanded the Army while introducing various training modules and exercises.
Battalions with a few troops were reinforced under the Armys right-sizing programme having taken all necessary measures to place all battalions and units on alert to face any eventualities By this time, all units under the Security Force Headquarters-Jaffna were reorganized under the right-sizing programme, and the Army challenges those so-called war analysts to name what those operationally important camps that were closed down, if any.
Relocating or shifting camps that remained at the time of the culmination of the war, and also afterwards does not in any way amount to any lapse, and such alterations are done, assessing security developments at ground level particularly on the recommendations of field commanders.
Some former commanders have effected changes in the past. Such action, if necessary, would continue in future also, assessing the security needs of the country, the Army in a statement said.

People will reap benefits of development programmes from next year
We took over the country when it was going through a really difficult time and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa called for an early Presidential election since he could not take the country forward, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Premier was speaking at a Puttalam District UNP Bala Mandala meeting on Saturday at Arora Hotel in Chilaw.
The Joint Opposition has not yet been able to realise the publics vision, but we were able to get a clear idea about the publics vision in 2015, the Prime Minister said. we have taken measures to fulfill the wishes of the public. If we fail to do that, the public will refuse us. So we have a responsibility of continuing the good work of the government.
Soon after we came into power, we were able to ensure the democracy, justice and media freedom of the country, Premier Wickremesinghe said. We have already planned to establish industrial zones in Hambantota and many other areas of the country. Tax reliefs have already been given for the establishment of industries. Construction of the Central Expressway has started. Measures have already been taken to establish free trade zones. Measures have also been taken to develop the countrys tourism industry. So we are expecting a rapid development of the country and the people will be able to reap the benefits of these development activities from next year.
Although the present government had to go through a hard time during the past three years, we didnt forget to fulfill the needs of the public.
A salary increase of Rs 10,000 was granted to public servants and Rs 20,000 food allowance was granted to pregnant mothers. Prices of stents used in heart surgeries was considerably reduced. The maximum limit of Rs. 1.5 million for the expenses for one cancer patient was lifted and now a cancer patients treatment does not have a limit. The prices of 48 varieties of essential pharmaceutical drugs has been reduced.
The present government also introduced the 1990 Suwaseriya emergency ambulance service. When we introduced this, Opposition members criticised it. But the ambulance service was used to send September 5 protesters to the hospital, the Prime Minister said.
Facilities were given to 9,000 schools under Langama Pasala Hondama Pasala concept of the government. The Suraksha insurance scheme was introduced for students. Measures have been taken to fill 4,000 principal vacancies. The Mahapola scholarship was increased to Rs. 5,000. Around 110 Uda Gammana villages have been established.
The middle-class housing programme was implemented, the Premier said.
For the first time in history, two million tourists arrived in Sri Lanka. We had been able to get back the GSP Plus relief. Measures have been taken to uplift the living standards of the fishing community. The Gamperaliya and Enterprise Sri Lanka programmes have been implemented to uplift the rural economy and provide assistance to entrepreneurs.

All Blacks say Sonny Bill a possible starter against Springboks
NELSON. The battered and bruised All Blacks listed Sonny Bill Williams as a possible starter against South Africa next week after he spent three months sidelined by a shoulder injury.
Concussion-prone Ryan Crotty was also declared fit to go, and lock Patrick Tuipulotu earned a recall on news that Brodie Retallick and Ngani Laumape would be out for several weeks after being injured in Saturday's hard-fought 46-24 win over Argentina in Nelson.
Retallick could be out for up to six weeks with a shoulder injury while Laumape, brought into the squad as injury cover, faces missing three weeks with a damaged knee.
But coach Steve Hansen said Crotty and Sam Cane had recovered from head knocks suffered against Australia early in the Rugby Championship, while Rieko Ioane -- recovering from a hamstring injury -- and Williams were also in the frame for selection.
Crotty and Cane could have played against Argentina but we just chose to give them another week, Hansen said Sunday.
Sonny, he'll get an X-ray (on his shoulder) again on Monday and if everything's clear there, he'll be available as well.
Rieko will be available, so whilst we're losing a couple, we're getting a couple back on deck as well. Williams, who missed the first two Tests against France in June following knee surgery, played 58 minutes of the third Test before injuring his shoulder and has been out of action ever since.
With back-up lock Luke Romano already down with a calf strain, Tuipulotu got his recall after last playing for the All Blacks in November last year.
The towering lock scored three tries in a provincial match over the weekend in what was his first game since injuring a shoulder in May.
The All Blacks' six-tries-to-three win over Argentina kept them well in front in the Rugby Championship, with 15 points from three bonus-point wins.
South Africa, Argentina and Australia have one win each, with South Africa second on the table courtesy of two bonus points.

AMCHAM/STAXs recommendations on positioning SL as an attractive FDI destination
AMCHAM, in collaboration with STAX, recently launched the 2018 whitepaper FDI Landscape and Investor Sentiment in Sri Lanka at a gathering of business and government leaders including the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama.
In addition to providing a definitive view of FDI statistics, the whitepaper interweaves expert insights from regulatory authorities to provide ten actionable recommendations for government stakeholders to enact.
Ten Actionable Recommendations:
Clarity and consistency of data: Currently, there are multiple sources of FDI data, that is confusing to the international investor community. We recommend that the Central Bank, BOI, and other relevant agencies coalesce together and have one consistent reporting methodology on FDI.
Digitize data collection: At present, most FDI data is gathered via an island-wide paper survey. The need of the hour is to digitize the process of data capture to better enable the widest penetration of the survey and streamline subsequent analysis.
Ensure a representative sample: While sectors like manufacturing are traditionally well-represented in FDI surveys, the picture is incomplete. To develop a fuller view of Sri Lankas FDI position, there is a need to capture data on FDI inflows entering under-represented sectors like Technology/KPO/BPO. In these sectors, most of the repatriable profits are reinvested into business expansion activities.
Develop one umbrella organization for FDI: Instead of having numerous line ministries with overlapping mandates for reaching out to global investors, there needs to be one central body capable of formulating policy, issuing guidelines, attracting investors and governing FDI flows.
Ensure long-term policy stability: About 59% of respondents surveyed in this report cited policy instability as a key barrier to conducting business. Changes in tax policy such as VAT rates, import duties and sudden shifts in economic strategy have all contributed to sending negative signals to prospective investors. Sustained policy stability is the need of the hour to provide a sense of clarity.
Negotiate favorable and clearly defined trade policies: Developing exports through Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and bolstering Sri Lankas position as a country with preferential access to markets like China, India and Europe, will be the cornerstone of establishing Sri Lankas attractiveness as an FDI destination.
Define and articulate Sri Lankas clear value proposition, across industries and capabilities: To attract FDI in a competitive global market, Sri Lanka needs to develop and communicate a clear and consistent value proposition to investors. Whether this value proposition relates to Sri Lankas strategic geo-political position or its access to talent, it is important that stakeholders reach a consensus and articulate the value proposition across industries and capabilities.
Improve transparency and corporate governance: Standards in areas such as corporate governance, government procurement, and transparency must be elevated in line with international practice.
Develop financial incentives to bring in capital across industries: Innovative financial incentives and grants are needed to further stimulate FDI across both capital-intensive and services-based industries.
Invest in education and vocational training to match industry needs and potential and improve productivity: At least 63% of respondents surveyed cited a shortage of quality labor. However, the problem isnt necessarily a human resource shortage as it is a failure to fully develop the workforce and improve productivity of the existing labor force.
STAX, Sri Lankas leading management consulting firm, has its headquarters in Boston, and branch offices across Chicago, New York, Colombo and Singapore. With a rich client base comprising 30+ local conglomerates and family businesses, 15 of the top 20 global investors and 25+ Fortune 500 companies.

Anxiety of the chronically early
The clocks were set to central daylight time on the day I was born. The clock on the microwave next to the stove where my dad was boiling water for pasta read four and some minutes when, from the living room, my mom said, I think we need to go to the hospital. She and my dad got in the car with no bags, none of the Sunday newspapers theyd spent the afternoon reading, and drove east toward Lake Shore Drive, which theyd take south to Michael Reese Hospital.
There are seven clocks in my one-bedroom apartment, two that tick loudly, two that dont tick, and three digital ones, all set to slightly different times not on purpose but because achieving such widespread accuracy is tough when youre twisting hands on faces with no numbers and constantly resetting the one digital clock that runs slow because its meant to be connected to DC power.
Watchs hands
I was born on Memorial Day weekend, a Sunday. Chicago was clear and warm, perfect for barbecues. I started wearing a watch as soon as I could tell time. My first watchs hands had tiny blue faces and names and a story from Swatch: Flik goes quick and Flak stays back. More than two decades later, I worry about time both near and far: how long itll take me to walk to my afternoon meeting, how long itll take me to fall in love with a yet-unmet man, how long itll be before I and this man who doesnt exist get married. Every time another friend posts a photo on Facebook with her fianc, her hand on his shoulder so you can see the diamond in iPhone flash, the panic bubbles. My current boyfriend, whom I dont suspect Ill marry, tells me I misuse jealousy and envy.
Sun fell through the windows of the maroon Volkswagen Golf onto my mom, reclined as far as her seat would allow. She was upright enough to see, just before the entrance to the Drive, that traffic was nearly stopped until at least Navy Pier, and upright enough to also see, in the sideview mirror, a canine-unit police cruiser a few cars away. My dad got out to talk to the police. My wife is in labor, he said to the canine-unit man. Follow me closely, the man said. They weaved through the dense traffic all the way south, where they exited, headed briefly west, and reached the hospital, two months early. My mom found the nearest wheelchair and sat in it.
If being late is a sign of self-involvement, then being early should be a sign of selflessness. But its not. It too is a kind of self-involvement, a deliberate refusal to measure accuratelyand show up on timebecause of the egotistical notion that your presenceyou being somewhereis so important that its best to err on the side of early.
Wisconsin-cursive
I used to set my watches early, not to trick myself into being on time, as the chronically late may do, but to have the feeling, any time I looked at my wrist, that I was already early.
Taped in my dads baby book are a lock of brown hair, the first tooth he lost. In it are Wisconsin-cursive lists of birthday presents and friends and milestones: walking, talking, adding, bike-ridingeach with a date, and every year with a set of height and weight numbers, an upward trajectory that ended at 13 years old. How much can time hold How much can data tell us I do not know how large 13-year-old boys should be, so my dads 63 inches and 103 pounds are unremarkableor, rather, remarkable not for their content but for their specificity, for the fact that they exist at all. In the hospital my mom told the nurse she hadnt yet gone to Lamaze classes, she didnt know what she was doing. The nurse told her to pick something physical to focus her gaze on, so my mom looked out the sixth-floor east-facing window and found in the turquoise wide-waled lake a sailboat to stare at. But then it was late-spring evening, and the sailboat disappeared into the reflective black of night over water, and there was no more looking and there was no more waiting: I was born. - Lit Hub

It has been eight years since Rev. Fr. Joseph Jayantha Siri Cooray entered eternal glory to be with his maker. His death anniversary fell on August 28.
Rev. Fr. Joseph Cooray, affectionately known as Fr. Siri, was born on July 27, 1956, in Moratuwa. He was the youngest son of the family. He had two elder sisters and a younger sister.
He received his primary and secondary education at St. Sebastian's College, Moratuwa and Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa. After completing his secondary education, he entered the University of Kelaniya, to read for a Bachelor of Arts degree.
At the end of his university degree, he entered the tutorial staff of St. Peter's College, Bambalapitiya, as a Logic teacher. He won the hearts of many students as he was highly-skilled.
They still admire him for his lively and stimulating style of teaching. He also published several books in Sinhala on the same subject, and it is noteworthy that the book titled 'Logic and the Scientific Method' is the first of its kind in our country and is living testimony to Fr. Siri's service in the field of Education.
It was at St. Peter's College that he received God's calling for priesthood. In 1984, he joined St. Aloysius' Seminary, Borella and later, continued his philosophical and theological studies at St. John Mary Vianney Seminary. He was ordained in 1994.
He began his priestly ministry as the assistant of Waga Parish, later, as the assistant of St. Sebastian's Shrine in Kandana and subsequently, as the parish priest of the same.
Afterwards, he shepherded the flock of St. John's Parish, Mutwal, for two years and they still remember his service with gratitude.
While he was actively involved in pastoral work, he successfully completed his MA in Social Science, at the University of Kelaniya.
In 2002, Rev. Father Siri joined the tutorial staff of St. Peter's College, where he rendered a vibrant service in different capacities. Having recognised his potential, the church hierarchy appointed him the Principal of the St. Peter's College branch in Udugampola, Gampaha.
During his tenure as principal, he rendered a yeoman service to the branch. Being a farsighted person, he bought a five-acre land with the objective of transforming it into a school playground. He meticulously carried out this task till his death.
Rev. Father Siri was a priest with a rare personality. He was also a strict disciplinarian. His compassion to students was mixed with a tinge of humour. Many of his colleagues have fond memories of him.
Viewed from a Christian perspective, he was a true servant of Christ with an empathetic heart. His natural knack for getting along with people made him go out of his way.
Thank you, drear Rev. Fr. Siri, for all that you had done for us without expecting anything in return.
May your soul rest in peace.

Sampath Agalawatta
Unique friend
Death is certain. We come with nothing into this world, and we will go with nothing but our impact on those we encountered during our lifetime.
Our friend, our teammate and colleague Sampath Agalawatte, passed away on August 29, this year. His funeral, in accordance with his wishes, was held within 24 hours of his passing. The irony of it all for me, was that I could not be there to bid farewell to one of my closest friends, as I was stuck in the Kumana National Park.
Life seems so cruel for him to be taken away from us so young, just ten days before his 53rd birthday. But whatever religion we believe in, there is a larger plan in the works for all of us, and it is left to those left behind to accept this reality and keep forging on. Yes, we knew the end was on the horizon once Agales diagnoses of Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and cancer were confirmed, but it still makes one feel desolate about losing a loved one and close friend. Agale was that to many people.
Agale was a unique friend. He was quiet and reserved with many, but vivacious and hilarious when with close friends. He would not let them down and was ethical in dealing with the world, which was a refreshing quality. In most instances, my experiences with him have been either black or white; no sitting on the proverbial fence. He was an old fashioned thinker on a personal level and at work, but you knew exactly where he stood on issues. These rare qualities made working with him easy and straightforward, especially in the context of todays corporate setting.
He was always happy-go-lucky with his friends and if he was in a drinking mood (more like a gulping mood), watch out; he danced, sang, shouted, pinched and screamed his lungs out in song during these times. He loved the Royal-Thomian Cricket match and during the last 5-10 years, if a Royalist scored a century, he would ingeniously find a way to avoid the stewards, prefects and security, in making a beeline to the middle of the pitch to congratulate the player. The sheer joy he demonstrated in jinxing and sidestepping away from the stewards on his way to the pitch, was his way of saying, Hey, I can still sidestep like I did during my playing days.
His love for his school and rugby was demonstrated when he joined our legendary Coach, Summa Navaratnam, to help coach our juniors (10 years and below) on most Friday afternoons and Sunday mornings. This was his dedication to his alma mater and the sport he loved the most. Agale was the Donhorst Prize Winner in 1984. He was fond of my parents and used to visit our home quite often during our rugby-playing days. On a day soon after he had achieved this accolade, he came by home and my dad was in our living room in a meeting with the then presiding Bishop of Colombo, Bishop Swithin Fernando.
My dad announced to the Bishop that Sampath was the winner of the Donhorst Prize at Royal, the most coveted prize at College previously won by another distinguished Royal alumni, the legendary Bishop Lakshman Wickremasinghe, Bishop of the Kurunegala Diocese. Before Bishop Swithin could even respond, Agale took off like a jack rabbit saying, No, no, its not me. He was too embarrassed and modest to admit that he was the winner.
Our 1984 Bangkok, Thailand, rugby team trip was a hilarious time for all of us. A time of growing up; a time when boys became men. Most of us were flying for the first time, so getting on the flight was an experience in itself. Agale, you will be missed, but not lost in our minds, you will be remembered as our friend, captain, work colleague and amba yahaluwa. We will never forget you!!
A wise man told me about 19 years ago; "Dont have regrets in life, but think of them as learning experiences, while looking forward to the future and not the past. Live the future like tomorrow is your last day."
Wise words indeed. So, my team mates and friends, I hope you do the same. It is never too late. To Dilhani, Samali, Samal and Sahan; Gods blessings. We will not go away and are only a phone call away. Stay strong, there is always a reason why God chose your loved one. He is in a better place.
May you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana, my friend. Rest in peace. You were a beacon of light to a lot of us. You keep looking out for us and we will do our best to live, love, enjoy and share.

Sunil C.S. Perera
A brilliant man
During most mornings, I would look at the slow-dancing river and marvel at the beauty of it. The pelicans would be wading through the waters, looking for fish, while the dugout canoes would be returning with weary fishermen dipping their paddles against the opposing currents.
Then I would see my friend Sunil C.S. Perera (Sunil Bada), sitting under the shade of a tree on the riverbank; a laptop settled on a wooden stool, working on something or nothing. That is how people of our vintage occupied our time.
He used to live close by; close enough for me to see his multi-coloured bougainvillea in bloom, as well as to hear his dogs bark. He was always a dog lover and had five of them; two dachshunds and three mixed-breeds.
Sunil Bada was my closest friend for more than 55 years. As children, we fished in the Lunawa Lagoon, played barefoot basketball and enjoyed eating ten-cent buns from the school bakery. Later, he entered university, while I flew aeroplanes.
'Buddy', as he was fondly known, was the most brilliant man I ever met in my life. At times, like most of us, he did have more folly than wisdom; but, in the over-all tally, he was exceptionally clever.
Professionally, he rose to the pinnacle, yet emotionally, he missed all the buses and ended up a bachelor. Sunil Bada had the temper of a tempest, but deep inside, he was a kind man. He worked on so many projects at Candle Aid (a humanitarian organisation), ran a cancer-assistance programme for the poor, and project-managed building houses for those dwelling in shanties as well as those who lost their houses in the 2004 Tsunami. He did have his silver linings which were never trumpeted.
Sunil Bada suffered a brief illness and breathed his last a few days ago. We all gathered, his siblings, his relatives and his friends, to give him a fitting farewell.
Most mornings, I look at the river as it does its slow dance in front of me. The pelicans are there, like sail-less galleons swimming about. The fishermen too, are crawling on their dugout canoes. An occasional fish leaps out of the water and marks his presence. I see them all, but there is no Sunil Bada sitting under the shade of a riverbank tree.
That somehow makes it lonesome for me.

Niranjan Nagendra
Talented individual
We were overcome with grief with the sudden passing of my dear nephew Niranjan, son of my brother Sri.
Death is inevitable; it comes to all; but when it comes to one who is close to you, it is indeed sad. Niranjan was educated at Royal College, Colombo and after working for a few years in the Mercantile Sector, proceeded to the U.K. to do his Chartered Insurance Institute examinations. He was an Associate of the Chartered Insurance Institutes in UK and Switzerland. Niranjan was also the Fair First Insurance Sales and Marketting General Manager. He was a Chartered Insurer and an Alumni of the International Institute for Management Development in Switzerland as well.
Niranjan was attached to Union Assurance in a similar capacity and also worked at Eagle Insurance PLC, where he served as General Manager/Head of Non-Life Distribution. Niranjan accounts for over 23 years of local and overseas exposure in Business Development and Marketting, in life and general Insurance.
He was qualified in underwriting the Property, Engineering, Miscellaneous and Motor classes of Insurance. A talented individual endowed with rare personal qualities, Niranjan made a tremendous contribution in every human activity he undertook. A fine conversationalist with a flair for public relations, he was a great asset to his company.
Niranjan was dedicated to his family. He was a loving husband to his wife Shivanthi and a devoted father to his only child Shevinka.
He memorably wore a warm smile. Due to his immense capacity for making friends, he had a wide circle of people close to him. Niranjan was a man who reached out to his friends, particularly in their times of distress. He was steadfast in his loyalty to them. This was evident from the very large crowd at his funeral.
His death has created a vacuum, and I have lost a dear nephew who is irreplaceable. An emptiness remains I thank God for his life. I will not say farewell because I know we will meet again.

Dr. Suppiah Shanmuganathan
He strove for greatness
An individual who lost his father at the age of two, Dr. Suppiah Senthe Shanmuganathan grew up striving for nothing but greatness. His hard work, perseverance and commitment to reach great heights opened many doors for him, including higher education and career advancement. At the end of his career, Dr. Senthe had published 55 research papers, here and abroad. Dr. Senthe completed his education in Jaffna a year ahead of his age, yet he could not enter the Colombo Medical College as he did not pass the Tamil language exam. He then decided to major in Chemistry with a minor in Mathematics. There were only seven spots available for the programme, and he won one of them, along with a full scholarship. Dr. Senthe topped his graduating class of 1950 and was a recipient of the memorial Kahn Prize.
He joined the Medical Research Institute (MRI) in 1951, a position which lead to overseas scholarships for him to pursue his PhD. This was the beginning of many scholarships for higher education, as well as experience, knowledge, presentations and travels around the world. At the University of Sheffield, UK, his research was funded by the Guinness Brewery, to find the source of the bitterness in beer.
His presentation in 1956 at the British Biochemical Meeting in Dublin, was his first to a non-Sri Lankan audience.
A year later, Dr. Senthe gave the same presentation at the University of Oxford as the first Sri Lankan to do so there. In 1958, he was offered a Post-Doctoral Fellowship at the Rutgers University in New Jersey, to work on yeast before returning to Sri Lanka with his PhD. In 1964, Dr. Senthe was one of two Sri Lankans to receive the Fulbright Scholarship granted by the US State Department. He was also selected to join the International Science Conferences in China, where he met Chairman Mao, as well as in India, where he met the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
Dr. Senthe's MRI colleagues were of the opinion that his greatest contribution to Sri Lankas medical service and general public, was also one of his best pieces of research. During the early years of his career, physicians used parameters of Clinical Pathology and Clinical Biochemistry given in British textbooks as the norm in treating patients. Dr. Senthe determined that those values were not applicable for Sri Lankans and others in Asia. He coordinated a project carrying out all baseline testing using healthy subjects and hospital patients who were Sri Lankans.
The result was the establishment of a normal value and a significant range for every test. Those were the same values which are being used by physicians in Sri Lanka today. This work was published in several of his papers, as well as medical magazines. Sri Lanka is richer from this thoughtful contribution. It could be said that among many of his achievements, this was one of the greatest contributions Dr. Senthe has made to the country.
Back in Sri Lanka, at MRI, Dr. Senthe was also a part-time lecturer at the Colombo Medical College and The Institute of Chemistry. This is when he realised the need for a diploma for lab assistants who wanted to pursue a career in Chemistry. By his initiative, the Diploma in Laboratory Technology in Chemistry (DLTC) was started at the College of Chemical Sciences.
Dr. Senthe was appointed the Director of the course and subsequently, became its coordinator. He was later appointed the President of the Institute of Chemistry Ceylon (ICHEMC), from 1972 to 1973. He received an Honourary Fellowship at the Institute of Chemistry in 2015, at the 44th Annual Sessions of the Institute. The ICHEMC bestowed upon him the Yeoman Service Award in February, this year, in appreciation of his contributions.
Dr. Senthe retired from MRI in 1986 as the Biochemistry Department Director. He then moved to Toronto, Canada, in 1987, to be with his three children and four grandchildren. There, he worked at Nucro-Technics Pharmaceutical Research and Development. Not everyone is able to work in their field in a foreign country at the age of 65. His expertise was recognised by the Canadian Government, which sent him to China three times, to solve scientific problems.
As an individual who recognised the benefits of financial assistance, as well as the importance of education, Dr. Senthe wanted to give back to the Institute of Chemistry where he served for a long time. He believed that education was the passport to a better life and a brighter future. He created a bursary at the Institute of Chemistry, and had encouraged and given the opportunity to many students to pursue their education without any hindrance. Dr. Senthe Shanmuganathan, an active individual until his last day, passed away at his home on August 20. His joyous and accomplished life was celebrated on August 22, in Toronto, Canada, with his family and friends.
Appa/Thathi brought joy and fulfilment to many. His legacy will live on forever.
We loved him dearly, then and now.
Dr. Senthelal Senthe, Dr. Nileshwa Senthe and Namita Kanishkan

Benefit-oriented approach to nutrition
According to a recent study, while a benefit-oriented approach to nutrition increases college students willingness to consume fruits and vegetables, the availability and cost of healthy food on campus are critical to changing their eating habits.
As part of the study, researchers surveyed 175 college students, assessing their willingness to change their diet to include more fruits and vegetables. Participants were asked to weigh pros like improved energy, meal variety and weight control against perceived disadvantages like being hungry, having less energy and not enjoying meals.
Once convinced that more fruits and vegetables would benefit them, students noted that other changes were needed in this area to help them consume fruits better. These included adding vending machines that sell produce, increasing the variety of fruits offered and improving the taste and variety of cafeteria meal choices. Most importantly, students said produce needs to be more affordable.
Manoj Sharma, lead researcher on this study said, Between 90 and 95 percent of adults in the U.S. do not consume the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables. This basic nutritional deficiency is tied to a myriad health problems, so it is important to address it early.
According to the survey, sustaining a diet with the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables requires an emotional shift, in which students decide to eat healthy even when they are stressed or feeling low. Respondents also said keeping a diary or utilizing an app that helped track eating habits would help monitor their consumption and rectify their diet if they face difficulties. Finally, enlisting the support of family and friends appeared crucial to sustainment.
Vinayak K. Nahar, co-author of this study said, Once we can entice students to add more fruits and vegetables into their diets and create conditions that make it possible, we have to then focus making those changes permanent.
The findings appeared in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association. ANI

Best source of nourishment for infants
This week Consultant Neonatologist attached to De Soysa Hospital for Women, Dr. Nishani Lucas and Dr. Hiranya Jayawickrama attached to the Child Nutrition Unit of the Family Health Bureau of the Health Ministry speak on goodness of breastfeeding and the dreadful effects of milk powder (infants formulas).
According to Dr. Lucas, the best milk for any infant/child is its mothers milk (breast milk). There are uncountable advantages of breast milk. The breast milk is full of nutrients and easily digestible, absorbed and prevents constipation. The breast milk protects the baby from infections such as diarrhoea, respiratory tract infections, ear infections etc and some other diseases such as allergies and eczemas that occur in adulthood. The breast milk ensures the optimum physical growth of the baby while enhancing intellectual capacity. Breast milk helps psycho-social development through the attachment or bonding between the mother and the baby. Breastfeeding safeguards the health status of the mother and reduces the risk of developing Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) such as obesity and diabetes in later life.
Artificial feeding (powdered milk / Infants Formula) may interfere the bonding. The mother and the baby may not develop such a close, loving relationship. The baby may not develop so well mentally and score lower on intelligence (IQ) tests. An artificially fed baby is more likely to become ill with diarrhea, respiratory diseases and other infections. The diarrhea may become persistent. The baby is more likely to develop allergic conditions such as Eczema and possibly Asthma. The baby may become intolerant of animal milk which will cause diarrhea, rashes and other symptoms. The risk of chronic diseases in the child such as diabetes is increased.
Formula milk is not a sterile product and harmful pathogens have been identified in sealed containers. Unhygienic preparation and unsupervised feeding leads to harmful consequences. The baby may get too little milk and become malnourished because of too few feeds or too dilute feeds. The baby is more likely to suffer from vitamin A deficiency. If gets too much artificial milk, a baby may become obese. A mother who does not breastfeed may become pregnant sooner. She is more likely to become anemic after child birth and later to develop cancer of the ovary and breasts, she added.
According to Dr. Jayawickrama, breastfeeding should be initiated within the first hour of birth of an infant. The first milk secrete immediately after the childbirth is called `Colostrum, which is a precious elixir. Feeding the infant with colostrum is very important.
This is yellowish in colour and thicker in consistency when comparing with ordinary breast milk. Sometimes it may be seen as a clear liquid. Quantity of milk that secrete at the start may be less but is not a reason to worry.
During the first six months, the mother should try to breastfeed the baby whenever possible without sticking to a time table. This ensures increased secretion of breast milk and continued adequate nutrition for the infant. Breastfeeding the infant at night will immensely helps to maintain secretion of milk at an optimum level. During the first six months, the total nutritional requirement of the infant could be provided by breast milk alone, she said.

Tips for working mothers
* Working mothers should plan to breastfeed their infants from the time of their pregnancy.
* During maternity leave period, the mother should breastfeed the infant at night continuously. This practice enables the mother to maintain an increase of secretion of breast milk.
* In the morning, before leaving home for work breast feed the child. In addition while the mother is at home, breastfeed the baby adequately.
* Express the quantity of milk that the baby required before leaving for work (previous day at night and in the morning).
* Then the caregiver of the baby could provide breast milk to the baby adequately at the correct time.
* While breastfeeding the baby, the mother can collect breast milk for use later (from the other breast while feeding or after feeding). This relieves the mother of having to find extra time or take effort to express breast milk.
****
* Breast milk should be collected in a clean small cup or a container. This should cover with a clean lid.
* The mother can have an estimate of the volume to express with experience over a suitable period of time.
* It is safe to give the collected breast milk within a day. Storing breast milk in separate small containers is convenient for the care giver.
* Breast milk can be stored for four to six hours in room temperature. The containers should be kept in a cool and dark place.
* In the lower part of the refrigerator, breast milk can be stored for 24 hours.
* Breast milk can be stored up to three months in a deep freezer.
* Breast milk that was stored in a refrigerator should be warmed by placing the cup on container in slightly warm water. Never use a stove or heater to warm breast milk.
* It should be remembered that only a cup and a spoon should be used to feed the breast milk to the baby and a bottle should NOT be used.
* Babies can be breastfed up to two years and beyond.

CITES Conference held in Sri Lanka next May
Sri Lanka has signed the host country agreement to hold the CITES World Wildlife Conference in Sri Lanka.
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) to be held in Sri Lanka has 183 countries as members of this convention.
This multilateral treaty is aimed at protecting endangered plants and animals from unsuitable trade. Member countries get-together for the summit every three years where important decisions are made on animal and plant trade.
The CITES convention operates on a system of permits and species are listed in schedules. For example, Sri Lankan leopard is in CITES schedule I, hence no trade is permitted.The Wildlife Conservation Department is the management authority of CITES convention in Sri Lanka.
A separate CITES Secretariat has been established to make arrangements to hold this international summit next year.
Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera who is coordinating the programme on behalf of the government told Daily News that the convention is held for two weeks from May 22, 2019 at the BMICH for which preparations are already in progress and this will be the largest UN event to be held in Colombo so far.
In addition to hosting the convention, Sri Lanka would benefit in numerous ways such as creating opportunities for small, medium and large scale industries to market their produce, academia, local research institutes, NGO and other institutes to host events to exhibit their contribution to conservation, schoolchildren and undergraduates to be volunteers for the conference and the public to engage in various activities including participating to CITES related competitions.

[CITIZENS' Mail - (10-09-2018)]
BUDDHISM IN THE NEW CONSTITUTION
There appeared in all newspapers, both Sinhala and English, the fears expressed by Opposition members in Parliament that the existing provision in the Constitution which states  CHAPTER 11  BUDDHISM-9 The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place accordingly, it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Article 10 and 14[1][e] will be replaced or diluted.
Going by experience, what has the existing provision done to promote and foster Buddhism It has been a tool in the hands of politicians to get political favours to be in power and in turn the Sangha too takes advantage to demand favours, thus making Buddhism a bartering business.
Readers will remember the active role played by a well-known Chief Incumbent of a Raja Maha Viharaya conducted Bodhi Poojas and also distributed Sil Redi for the victory of a certain political party leader and his party to come to power. Then a leading Buddhist monk allowing his temple premises to be used as a political party office, organising Pindapatha to pay a fine imposed by courts. Best not mention the behaviour of some Buddhist monks. What is the result of this provision
The Sangha neglect their legitimate religious duties to preach the Dhamma and conduct Buddhist rites and rituals, thus depriving devotees of their spiritual needs. To prove this allegation, I would wish to place my humiliating and disgraceful experience at a very famous temple where a recognised Chief Buddhist monk, now no more, when I complained of a monk in his temple had refused to issue me a Pirith Noola requesting to come later.
He said that tying Pirith Noola has become a nuisance and hinders other work. I fail to understand what his other work was: probably politics as was seen during the Presidential elections.
If that is being the real situation where politics rather than protecting and fostering Buddhism takes advantage, then the committee responsible for drafting the new constitution should seriously think of how to avoid this calamitous situation.
To be honest, it is the innocent Upasaka and Upasikas who protect and foster Buddhism and also the Sangha by providing all their needs. Arent our local and foreign Buddhist organisations doing a magnificent job to popularise Buddhism without government intervention and support Leave the Maha Nayake Theras and Head of Nikayas to shoulder that responsibility of promoting and propagating Buddhism and let politicians rule the country to bring peace, harmony, development and prosperity. Hence should there be any need for government intervention to protect and foster Buddhism. It is certainly counterproductive.

Coconut growers laud  lifting of export ban
The government has lifted the ban imposed on exporting fresh coconuts responding favourably, to the appeal made by the Coconut Growers Association Sri Lanka, (CGASL).
A former President of the CGASL Ranjith Dias, said with the lifting of the ban imposed on the export of fresh coconut, members and exporters were in a position to utilize the opportunity to their benefit.
Dias said that the Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) has allowed the exporters to make use of the export license issued for the year 2017, until the end of this year. He said this was a result of the efforts on the part of the CGASL, who made representations to the authorities. The coconut industry in Sri Lanka was in crisis in the recent past, and the industry along with the CGASL had been concerned over the farm gate price coming down to the range of Rs. 23 to 25. This was around Rs 45 in July this year.
The CGASL had requested the authorities to intervene to revive the farm-gate price, as it was a necessity with the coconut growers could not even meet the cost of production per nut, which was around Rs 30 to 45, at the time the association made the request.
Dias said the association was happy with the governments decision to impose Rs. 20 as duty on imported palm oil per each kg which in turn stabilize the farm-gate price of coconuts and help those involved in coconut growing industry.

Colombo to host Senior International Badminton Tournament in November
Veteran and masters badminton players in Sri Lanka will be up against international counterparts when the Senior International Badminton Tournament begins at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium in Colombo on November 26 .
The four-day event is organised by the Ceylon Masters Badminton Association (CMBA) and is endorsed by the Sports Ministry.
Speaking during a press conference held in Colombo, the tournament's Deputy Director, Trevor Reckerman, said: Badminton is a sport loved by many sportsmen and women that has brought many accolades to the country playing on the international scene. But sad to say, players, after reaching their peak form, give up the game at competitive level and continue at it just to maintain their fitness.
In other countries shuttlers who have gone past 35 years, get the opportunity to continue with the game at competitive level in their countries and also conduct Invitational Tournaments at which Sri Lankan senior shuttlers too participate and bring glory to the country. Considering these facts, the Ceylon Masters Badminton Association decided to conduct the Senior International Badminton Tournament which has received the approval of the Ministry of Sports, Reckerman said.
The tournament will also help to promote the sport among veterans while developing the interest at international level. With many foreign senior players in action in the local arena the young local players will get the opportunity to witness them and improve on their own standards. Already players from over 10 countries have made enquiries about the tournament and had stated that they are willing to come for the event, Reckerman added.
Competitions will be held under eight age categories, namely over 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70 in men's and women's singles, doubles and mixed doubles.
The podium winners in each category will be awarded medals and certificates while a total of $7500 will be on offer for champions and runners up of each event.
Also, during the press briefing, CMBA President Rohan de Silva launched the Association's web site www.ceylonmasters.com, which will publish all relevant details regarding the event. Interested players can enroll online via the CMBA web site before November 12 and the draw will be held on November 19.
The CMBA will hold the players briefing at Hotel Galadari, Colombo 1 on November 25 at 5.00 pm, followed by the technical officials meeting.
The event will culminate with a farewell banquet dinner, hosted by the CMBA, on the final day of the event at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium. On court doctors will be on duty at the tournament venue and an ambulance services will also be available if necessary. Participants can also hire the services of a physiotherapist with prior appointment at the venue.
The organisers have teamed up with five of the star-class hotels in Colombo in providing hospitality and travel packages for participants and the plans include the tournament's entry fees, transport, accommodation and breakfast.

Highest growth port in 1H 2018
Colombo Port ranked Worlds No 1
The Port of Colombo is ranked as worlds number one container growth port among the top 30 container ports for the first half of 2018.
In container handling Port of Colombo has recorded a 15.6% growth for the first half of 2018 over same period last year according to Alphaliner Monthly 2018. It is also a very significant achievement as it is the first time in history the Port of Colombo reaches the top of a global maritime ranking. With this growth, Port of Colombo has leaped ahead many other Asian Ports, Major European Ports and Dubai as well.
According to Alphaliner global port rankings the top container growth ports such as Singapore marked 11.6% ranking number two, Guangzhou 8.6% number three, Antwerp (Belgium) 8.3% number four and Port of Xiamen  (China) 7.6% number five.
The Alphaliner that makes the analysis is the first-choice knowledge base used by many port authorities terminal operators, logistics companies, shippers, research companies and banks and other financial institutions.
Recently the three terminal operators at the Port of Colombo; the Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) under SLPA, the South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT) and the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT) reached into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to operate collectively to promote the Port of Colombo. Under the new collective agreement, it is expected to minimize the total turnaround time of all container vessels. Further, through the new agreement, terminals will also be able to promote the Port of Colombo collectively and collaboratively in the arena of international maritime business. Under the leadership of Minister of Ports and shipping Mahinda Samarasinghe, and instructions by the Chairman of Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake the positive increase at SLPA controlled terminals and especially the Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) is reasoned towards direct and straight forward decisions .The recognition of credibility towards the management has encouraged the employees of SLPA to dedicatedly contribute towards efficient service along with collaborative support by all parties and stakeholders engaged in the port operations to keep SLPAs productivity at a steadily and sustainably increasing rate. Creating history, the Port of Colombo for the first time has recorded 6.2 million container operations in year 2017. The Drewry Port Connectivity Index at its most recent release had ranked the Port of Colombo as the 13th best Connectivity Port in the world for the 4th quarter 2017, up by 05 places from its previous positioning of ranks. According to the rankings the Port of Colombo is also the top best connectivity port in South Asia. For its dedicated performance to up lift the position of the Port of Colombo in the world maritime map, Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) was awarded the Ports Authority of the Year Award by the Global Ports Forum (GPF) in 2018.

Crafts paradise
Shilpa Abhimani 2018 is bigger and better this year creating tremendous enthusiasm, supporting the national handicraft sector by its phenomenal success. Daily News spoke to Chairperson, National Crafts Council, Heshani Bogollagama on this extremely commendable initiative.
The National Crafts Council is functioning under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and it was established mainly to ensure the traditional handicrafts of Sri Lanka, are nurtured and preserved and also developed in a sustainable manner.
We have two partnering bodies, one is Laksala and one is National Designs Center who we work together to ensure that this industry is sustained and it also keeps in par with the traditions of Sri Lanka. In order to ensure the sustainability of the crafts we have training centers around the country. National Crafts Council has stepped in to make sure that this traditional craft is preserved. The national crafts council is working with the ministry of education to make the younger generation, aware about this traditions, said Bogollagama.
Bogollagama pointed out that there are 112 training centers around the country where they take in newcomers  people who want to engage in this industry and who like to learn this craft and there onwards take the industry forward.
Felicitating masters
We have also master craft training programs where we take masters in this craft who have learnt this traditionally through their previous generations and they have a lot of knowledge. We felicitate them and we take them as trainers and we have separately 75 master craft training programmes established around the country. We also want to ensure that the youth of Sri Lanka, value and treasure these crafts, stated Bogollagama
Bogollagama added that earlier people used to take a cane basket when marketing. They have always given a place to Sri Lankan products. Today due to convenience, prices and the open market we have lost our traditions and we have lost what is ours. We have to make people more aware especially the younger generation.
If you take the traditional handicrafts it has a history of over 2,500 years. But in the past it was centered with different caste systems and it is also something that came from generation to generation. If you read about the story of King Vijaya and Kuweni, when King Vijaya landed in Sri Lanka, what was Kuweni doing She was weaving cotton. If you read about the tales of the Ramanayana, it talks about our grand crafts. Of course Sri Lanka has its own indigenous crafts. Some people say yes it is influenced by Indian crafts, but actually we have our own indigenous crafts and it is there in written history and in folk history, said Bogollagama.
Shilpa Abhimani is the presidential handicraft competition and exhibition, which is organized annually. This is actually the third consecutive time, that the National Crafts Council is hosting a presidential award handicraft competition.
We are thankful to President Maithripala Sirisena, for giving us this opportunity. Because in the past, the highest felicitation one could receive, was the felicitation by the King. These traditional crafts have been sustained in this country because the King used to felicitate the craftsmen. So after so many years, yet again the craftsmen have received that honour where they receive, a presidential award for their crafts, said Bogollagama.
This competition is organized in three stages to ensure the crafts are of high standard.
The first stage is workshops. Around the country in all 25 districts Senior Lecturers from Moratuwa University, University of Visual Arts, conducted awareness programmes. Here craftsmen are made aware about new trends, the traditions, colours. This year, the theme centers on the natural beauty of Sri Lanka, and also the value of nature. All our products are based with natural raw materials. The second stage is the provincial competitions which have already been completed.
Then the final stage is the national competition - the Shilpa Abhimani presidential awards competition and exhibition and the international crafts festival which will be taking place from the September 12- 16, at the BMICH.
Therefore we are expecting President to inaugurate the ceremony and felicitate our craftsman. The felicitation/ award ceremony will happen later separately. The competition has been taking place over these few days and we will distribute over six million rupees in cash to the craftsmen as a form of felicitation, pointed out Bogollagama.
Handicrafts for children
Bogollagama added that they have started a new programme called Shilpa Navodya with the Ministry of Education, which has been very successful.
We started this programme last year, where we selected ten schools per district and we went to over than 250 schools, and covered the entire island, we first made the school children aware of handicrafts, and about the traditions behind it, about different sectors, because we have altogether 21 sectors, 21 main sectors that we call traditional handicrafts. There onwards the interested parties were given training. We trained over 10,000 school children last year and we had the first ever all island school handicraft competition this year in June. It was of very high standard, where we saw children engaging in crafts for the first time, and they were very enthusiastic and their crafts were of extremely high quality. Thereby we actually see the youth, of Sri Lanka wanting to take these crafts forward, explained Bogollagama.
Crafts exhibition
The exhibition will take place from September 12  16, where the public can come and see these award winning crafts. At the same time we have over 100 stalls, for local and international craftsmen, for the public to go and purchase craft items directly from the producers without any intermediaries.
With the provincial competition been completed, over 8,000 crafts were brought forward by over 4,000 craftsmen compared to last year. Last year we had around 3,100 craftsmen who participated. Out of that we have already selected over 1500 crafts, to bring to the national level competition, explained Bogollagama.
At the moment they are collecting the crafts from all the provinces which will be brought to the BMICH. There are over 30 high ranked judges, who will judge.
Bogollagama said that there is a need to get the youth more involved in the craft sector. To attract the youth it needs to be fashionable but to sustain these traditional crafts, it should be something valued by everybody.
In the last five to six years, especially post war period, there is a lot of enthusiasm, and a lot of interest in the arts and crafts sector. Especially in performing arts, you see so many dramas, musicals which did not happen maybe when we were in schools. We did not see so many arts taking place. But people do not have the access to know about traditional crafts in Sri Lanka. That is where the National Crafts Council is coming in and we are making the schools aware. We have from one side potential craftsmen, and also the consumers of tomorrow. From the other side we also have to be more socially aware, explained Bogollagama.
There are 26,000 craftsmen who are currently registered with the National Crafts Council and 75 per cent of it is women. These women are doing it as a main livelihood. In the sector of these handicrafts, they can do this industry, as a home based industry. Therefore we have to ensure, that social problems, dont happen in the future. We make these industries more popular for women to work from home. And from the other side, we have to be more environmentally conscious consumers, said Bogollagama. Bogollagama stressed every time we buy a polythene bag, and the environment is in danger.
At the exhibition, every day we will be having a special programme where we are training the award winning school children from Shilpa Navodya and they will have the opportunity to learn more advanced techniques, she explained.
We are giving the current craftsmen the opportunities to learn about the export market, about doing more environmentally friendly production schemes and we have five foreign countries participating. We will have workshops with local and foreign craftsmen as an exchange program. We have participants from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Malaysia.
They will bring their products and people can also learn about the crafts and they can also purchase crafts coming from those countries, she added.
Along with that we will be having performing arts every day in the evening including cultural shows, for the people coming to see the exhibition. They can also witness some beautiful cultural shows, both local and international with the Indian Cultural Center, Janakala, and Tower hall participating, explained Bogollagama.
Lake House is the print media sponsor of this event.

Djokovic eyes Sampras mark in Del Potro US Open final duel
NEW YORK, Saturday - Novak Djokovic can equal Pete Sampras's record of 14 Grand Slam titles when he faces Juan Martin del Potro in Sunday's US Open final where friendship will be put to one side in pursuit of unfinished business.
Djokovic is into his eighth final in New York where he was champion in 2011 and 2015.
But the 31-year-old Serb has also suffered five heartbreaking defeats in 2007, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2016.
Del Potro won his only Slam at the tournament in 2009, memorably defeating Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer back-to-back to achieve the goal.
His career then famously suffered an injury-plagued nosedive which pushed him to the brink of retirement three years ago.
For Djokovic, another appearance in the final at Flushing Meadows looked unlikely just three months ago. A quarter-final defeat at Roland Garros, where he had completed the career Grand Slam in 2016, left him in deep despair, threatening even to skip Wimbledon. It was the latest setback to his motivation already dealt bodyblows by an elbow injury which forced him to skip last year's US Open and contributed to a last-16 exit at January's Australian Open.
But the man hardened by the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 showed his inner steel by confounding everybody by racing to a fourth Wimbledon title in July.
Just as at the All England Club, principle rivals Federer and Nadal departed New York earlier than expected, paving the way for Djokovic to eat further into their legacy.
As well as going level with Sampras on Sunday, a win for Djokovic would put him just three majors behind Nadal and six back from Federer who is six years older.
After needing two four-setters in the opening two rounds, Djokovic has glided into the final, his 23rd at the Slams. He has dropped serve just five times -- three of those coming in the first two rounds. He also enjoys an impressive head-to-head record over the 29-year-old Del Potro, winning 14 of their 18 matches. That includes all four meetings at the Slams.
He's a gentle giant, said Djokovic of his giant Argentine opponent.
He nurtures the right values in life. He cares about his family. He cares about his friends. He respects everyone.
He fights every match from the first to the last point. He treats others the way he wants others to treat him. I think that's why people love him.
Del Potro will be playing in just his second final at the majors.
When he swept to the 2009 title in New York, he was just 20 years old and expected to establish himself as a permanent rival to Djokovic, Federer and Nadal.
But as those three carved up the Slams between them -- 50 in total -- Del Potro spent more time on the operating table than on the courts.
Three wrist surgeries caused him to miss 10 Grand Slam events and by the end of 2015, his world ranking had plummeted to 581.
The worst moment was in 2015 when I was close to quitting because I couldn't find a way to fix my wrist problems, he said.
I was suffering a lot. I got depressed for a couple of months also.
This year, Del Potro has lurked as a major threat, beating Federer for the Indian Wells Masters title and making the semi-finals at Roland Garros and last-eight at Wimbledon.
I didn't expect to get this kind of emotions playing tennis again. Reaching finals, winning titles, having my highest ranking ever in this moment, everything is almost perfect, he said.  AFP

People in several areas protest on main roads demanding water. They complain the water that they are given is inadequate even to quest their thirst.
Residents of Thandiayadi, Sangamankandy, Umiri,Nerupuram, Thangavelayuthapuram, Kanchirankudah, Manadana and Sagamam carried placards along the main road demanding a solution.
They handed over a memorandum to MP Kaveenthran Kodeeswaran, Divisional Secretary S. Jergarajan and Thirukovil Predeshya Saba Chairman I.V. Kamalarajan.
Many lament that they cannot engage in their livelihoods without water.
The Irrigation Department sources said paddy farmers cultivated only 124,000 acres for the Yala season because they do not get sufficient water even though they could cultivate 36,000 acres if they had enough water.

Election season in a dangerous Democracy
Last Thursdays morning papers in India settled something that we have been debating for a while. A front-page report about the arrests of five political activists in The Indian Express read, Those held part of anti-fascist plot to overthrow government, Pune Police tell court. We should know by now that we are up against a regime that its own police calls fascist. In the India of today, to belong to a minority is a crime. To be murdered is a crime. To be lynched is a crime. To be poor is a crime. To defend the poor is to plot to overthrow the government.
When the Maharashtra state police conducted simultaneous raids on the homes of several well-known activists, poets, lawyers, and priests across the country and arrested five peoplethree high-profile civil rights defenders and two lawyerson ludicrous charges, with little or no paperwork, the government would have known that it was stirring up outrage. It would have already taken all our reactions into account, including all the protests that have taken place across the country, before it made this move. So why has this happened
Recent analyses of actual voter data, as well the Lokniti-CSDS-ABP Mood of the Nation survey, have shown that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are losing popularity at an alarming (for them) pace. This means that we are entering dangerous times.
There will be ruthless and continuous attempts to divert attention away from the reasons for this loss of popularity, and to fracture the growing solidarity of the opposition. It will be a constant circus from now until the elections in 2019arrests, assassinations, lynchings, bomb attacks, false flag attacks, riots, pogroms. We have learned to connect the season of elections with the onset of all kinds of violence. Divide and rule, yes. But add to thatdivert and rule. From now until the elections, we will not know when, and where, and how the fireball will fall on us, and what the nature of that fireball will be.
Strange events
So, before I speak about the arrests of the lawyers and activists, let me reiterate a few points that we must not allow our attention to stray from, even while it rains fire, and strange events befall us.
* It has been a year and almost ten months since November 8, 2016, when Prime Minister Modi appeared on TV and announced his policy of demonetization of 80 percent of the currency in circulation. His own Cabinet seemed to have been taken by surprise. Now the Reserve Bank of India has announced that more than 99 percent of the currency was returned to the banking system. The Guardian reported last week that the policy has likely wiped 1 percent from the countrys GDP and cost approximately 1.5 million jobs. Meanwhile, just the printing of new currency has cost the country several thousand crores (a crore being 10 million rupees, equivalent to about $140,000). After demonetization came the Goods and Services Taxa tax that is structured in ways that have dealt a further body blow to small and medium businesses that were already reeling under demonetization.
While small businesses, traders, and, most of all, the poor have suffered enormously, several corporations close to the BJP have multiplied their wealth several times over. Businessmen like the Kingfisher Airlines and Beer magnate Vijay Mallya and the diamond merchant Nirav Modi have been permitted to decamp with thousands of crores of public money while the government looked away. What kind of accountability can we expect for all of this None Zero
Through all this, as it prepares for the 2019 election, the BJP has emerged as the wealthiest political party in India by far. Outrageously, the recently introduced electoral bonds promissory notes, that donors can buy and donate anonymously to the political party of their choiceensure that the sources of the wealth of political parties can remain secret from public scrutiny.
* We all remember the farce in Mumbai at the Make in India event inaugurated by Modi in 2016, at which a huge fire burned down the main stage at the cultural festival. Well, the real bonfire of Make in India turned out to be the Rafale fighter plane deal with the French government, which was announced by the prime minister in Paris in April 2015 seemingly without the knowledge of his own defense minister. This is against all known protocol. We know the bare bones: a deal had already been put in place in 2012 under the Congress-led UPA government to buy planes that would be assembled by the public sector company, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. That deal was scrapped by Modi and reconfigured. Hindustan Aeronautics was surgically excised. The Congress Party, as well as several others who have studied the new deal, have alleged corruption on an unimaginable scale and have accused the government of negotiating an offset contract for Reliance Defence Limited, a private sector company in India that is deep in debt and has never built a plane in its life.
The opposition has demanded a joint parliamentary committee probe. Can we expect one Or must we swallow this whole fleet of planes along with everything else and not even gulp
* The investigation by the Karnataka state police into the assassination of the journalist and activist Gauri Lankesh has led to several arrests, which have, in turn, led to the unveiling of the activities of several right-wing Hindutva organisations such as the extremist Sanatan Sanstha group. What has emerged is the existence of a shadowy, full-blown terrorist network, with hit lists, hideouts and safe houses, flush with arms, ammunition, and plans to bomb, kill, and poison people.
How many of these groups do we know about How many are continuing to work in secret With the assurance that they have the blessings of the powerful, and possibly even the police, what plans do they have in store for us What false-flag attacks And what real ones Where will they occur Will it be in Kashmir In Ayodhya (Where the BJP has promised to build a temple in place of the mosque, the Babri Masjid, which was demolished by participants in a 1992 by mob backed by senior leaders of the BJP.) In Assam (Where four million people have been excluded by the recently published National Register of Citizens.) At the Kumbh Mela (A Hindu festival at which almost ten million pilgrims are expected to gather in January 2019.) How easily they could derail everythingeverythingwith some major, or even minor, attacks that are amplified by the governments pet media houses. To divert attention from this, the real threat, we have the hue-and-cry over the recent arrests.
* The speed at which educational institutions are being dismantled. The destruction of universities with fine track-records, the elevation of phantom universities that exist only on paper. This is arguably the saddest thing of all. It is happening in several ways. We are watching Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) being taken down before our very eyes. The students as well as the staff are under continuous attack. Several television channels have actively participated in spreading lies and fake videos that have endangered the lives of students, and these have led to an assassination attempt on the young scholar Umar Khalid, who has been mercilessly defamed.
Then you have the falsification of history and the idiotification of the syllabus, which will, just in a few years time, lead to a kind of cretinism from which we will be unable to recover. Finally, the privatization of education is undoing even the very small good that the policy of reservation (the equivalent of what is called in the US affirmative action) did. We are witnessing the re-Brahminization of education, this time fitted out in corporate clothes. Students from Dalit, Adivasi, and Other Backward Caste (OBC; the official government term) backgrounds are once again being pushed out from institutions of learning because they cannot afford the fees. This has begun to happen already. It is completely unacceptable.
* Some other things we must not look away from: enormous distress in the agricultural sector, increasing numbers of farmers suicides, the lynching of Muslims and the relentless attack on Dalits, the public floggings, the arrest of Chandrashekhar Azad, the leader of the Bhim Army (a Bahujan-rights organisation), who dared to stand up to attacks by upper castes. The dilution of the legal protections for minority groups enacted in the 1989 Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.
Having said this much, I come to the recent arrests.
None of the five people who were arrested last weekVernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferreira, Sudha Bharadwaj, Varavara Rao, and Gautam Navlakhawere present at the Elgar Parishad rally in Pune that took place on December 31, 2017, and was organised by two eminent retired judges, Justice Sawant and Justice Kolse-Patil, or at the rally the following day when approximately 300,000 people, mostly Dalit, gathered to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the BhimaKoregaon victory. (Dalits joined the British to defeat an oppressive Peshwa regimeone of the few victories that Dalits can celebrate with pride.)
Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act
This second rally was attacked by Hindutva fanatics, which led to days of unrest. The two main people accused of fomenting this violence are Milind Ekbote and a Hindutva ideologue, Sambhaji Bhide. Both are still at large. Instead, following an FIR (First Information Report) registered by one of their supporters, in June 2018, the Pune Police arrested five people: Rona Wilson, a political activist from Delhi; Sudhir Dhawale, a Dalit activist from Mumbai; Shoma Sen, a professor from Nagpur; Mahesh Raut, an activist and former Prime Ministers Rural Development programme fellow; and the lawyer Surendra at the January 1 rally, and also of plotting to kill Prime Minister Modi. They remain in custody, charged under the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Fortunately, they are still alive, unlike the nineteen-year-old woman Ishrat Jahan, and Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kauser Bi, who were accused of the same crime, but did not live to see a trial because they were shot dead in what the police called encounters, claiming self-defense in what are suspected cases of extra-judicial executions (Ishrat Jahan in 2004; the other two in 2006).
The Maharashtra state police say that this recent round of arrests is based on information gleaned from the documents seized from those arrested in June that implicates all the accused in a plot to fund and foment violence at the Elgar Parishad and the BhimaKoregaon anniversary rallies, as well as in a plot to kill Narendra Modi. Justice Sawant and Justice Kolse-Patil have made public statements that they were the main organisers and sole funders of the Elgar Parishad, with the aim of rallying people against divisive Hindutva forces. Both have taken full responsibility for the event. Yet the police and the government have ignored them completely. The police and government have their reasons.

Englands Anderson fined for dissent in India Test
LONDON, Sunday - England fast bowler James Anderson has been fined 15 percent of his match fee for showing dissent to the umpire in Saturdays play in the fifth Test against India at the Oval.
Anderson is just two shy of Australia great Glenn McGraths record of 563 Test wickets -- the most taken by any fast bowler.
Chasing that record on the second day of the Test, Anderson was angry at an unsuccessful lbw review against star batsman Virat Kohli in the 29th over of Indias innings.
He snatched his cap and jumper from umpire Kumar Dharmasena and spoke to him in an aggressive manner, the ICC said in a statement issued on Sunday.
Anderson has admitted the offence and accepted the sanction, the ICC said.
In addition to the fine, one demerit point has been added to his disciplinary record. AFP

EV charging points in  Tenaga parking locations
Tenaga Car Parks (Pvt) Ltd, has collaborated with JLanka E-Mobility (Pvt) Ltd, to make urban life easier for electric vehicle drivers. Through this partnership JLanka E-Mobility will deploy EV charging points in designated Tenaga parking locations.
Motorists will use a single interface for both parking and charging  with charging an EV (Electric Vehicle) also means parking it. What Tenagas Park Smart offers drivers of EVs is one single interface for convenient start, stop and extending of charging and parking transactions. Letting charging become an integrated part of the Park Smart parking experience makes life for EV drivers easier. Keeping both charging and parking together in one user flow means there is no need for dual user interfaces and separate flows and for drivers who use the mobile app for parking; making the task so much easier.
Our vision is to make it as convenient as possible for drivers to find and pay for parking in the city. With our app you can already start, stop and extend your parking  no matter whether you are at a meeting, in a caf or shopping. Now we are looking to make it easier to be an EV-driver as well, by allowing users to pay for parking and charging through just one transaction, said Duminda Jayatilake, Managing Director of Tenaga Car Parks (Pvt) Ltd.
Sri Lanka is somewhat slow in adapting to EVs, mainly due to lacking infrastructure. This initiative will contribute to the creation of smarter and more sustainable solution that helps create greener and a more livable city said Sujeeva Premaratne  Head of Business of JLANKA E-Mobility (Pvt.) Ltd.
The user experience starts off with a registration flow, either through one of the smartphone apps, the web or a call to the call centre.
With the GPS enabled ParkSmart App, motorists will be able to check location of charging points and if they are available or not. Customers will be able to pay for their EV charging through the Park Smart app in which payment options such as eZcash, M-Cash, FriMi, Visa, MasterCard, and Amex are all available.

Sara Iftekhar, a law student from Huddersfield, is one of 50 contestants in the final stages of the Miss England beauty contest.
She is also the first Muslim woman wearing a hijab in the final. Earlier this year, Maria, another Muslim contestant wearing a headscarf, was the first Muslim contestant to enter the competition but Sara, 20, is the first to get this far in the elimination rounds.
She will walk down the catwalk at Kelham Hall in Nottinghamshire, when the winner is decided.
After winning the Miss Huddersfield 2018 and Miss Yorkshire Popularity 2018 contests, Sara has her eyes set on the Miss England title, the woman from the UK who will go on to represent the nation in Miss World.
Wow, I cant even comprehend how amazing it felt for my name to be announced as a finalist in the Miss England Finals 2018, she told her Instagram followers.
It was an incredible experience and something which I will never be able to forget. The opportunities which I have received with being a finalist in Miss England are opportunities which I would never have thought of, and will forever be grateful for.
The competition is raising funds for Beauty with a Purpose, a charity that has helped underprivileged children, displaced children in Vietnam and cleft palate teams in South America, Sri Lanka and Russia, as well as people affected by natural disasters.
Sara has used her platform to show support for the charity and set up a Go Fund Me page. On the page, she wrote, I participated in Miss England 2018 to show that beauty doesnt have a definition. Everyone is beautiful in their own ways, regardless of their weight, race, colour or shape.
If Sara wins the title, shell be going to Sanya in China to represent England at Miss World. Metro

Give ear to hear the quiet cries for help!
Today Monday September 10 is World Suicide Prevention Day. A recent report detailing the mental health of adolescents in Sri Lanka and the World Health Organisation has revealed that seven percent of adolescents aged between 13 and 17 have attempted suicide one or more times.
The report also reveals that nine percent of adolescents have considered committing suicide and five percent of these youth suffer anxiety while nine percent experience loneliness. From a global perspective statistics reveal that one person commits suicide every 40 seconds.
A study conducted by the WHO in 2014 had ranked Sri Lanka in the fourth position among 172 countries in terms of most suicide prone counties in the world. Several suicidal people do at times give out warning signs in the hope that they will be rescued. Most just want an end to the never ending emotional pain and hurt, not to die.
To certain people who have never experienced depression, the seemingly invisible condition can seem like a simple lack of will power. They take the condition far too lightly and often dismiss it asking them to cheer up or tell them they are making a big deal of some trivial problem.
Many may believe it is a desire for drama or attention, or worse still by accusing them of being selfish. The problem is that none of that is true. The real issue is that a person with depression suffers from a condition just as real as chicken pox or the flu. Society does not blame people who have chicken pox or the flu, but we do unfairly blame people with depression for their symptoms.
Most studies indicate that depression is either caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain or substance abuse. Whether it stems from other factors or not it is a clearly diagnosable condition that many people suffer from. It is not a moral failing. It does not mean they are weak or incorrigible. It means they are suffering from a medically diagnosable condition. As such there are many things that can be done for it.
What makes a person want to commit suicide This is not an easy question to answer. The answers vary from person to person. But usually the reply involves trying to block out unbearable emotional pain and hurt. Many times it is a silent cry for help. When you get to the point of contemplating suicide, you are often so distressed that you are unable to see any other options, any other way out.
Everyone has problems and can usually find ways of dealing with isolated stressful or traumatic events and experiences reasonably well. But sometimes there is a build up of these kinds of events over a period of time. When this happens all the coping strategies that they have put into place are pushed to their limits.
These limits vary from person to person. Rape and abuse survivors are extremely vulnerable targets. They have to deal with all kinds of memories, flashbacks of terror, depression, relationship problems, trust issues to name but a few, on top of everyday problems that may crop up. It sometimes gets to the stage where it all becomes too much to deal with.
A person who is contemplating suicide is usually so distressed that they cant see that there are other options available to them. Their distress is overwhelming and they can feel totally isolated and alone with their feelings.
When someone tells you they are having suicidal thoughts and feelings it is imperative that you listen. Encourage them to talk about their feelings. They need to know how you feel about it. Tell them outright that you dont want them to die. Try to make yourself available for them. Never dismiss their problems lightly. Take them seriously. Try to extract a promise from them that when they feel suicidal they will contact you or someone who can help, such as a counsellor or a doctor, before they do anything.
Many may consider talking may not be doing much to help in such a crucial issue. Nothing could be further from the truth. Talking is certainly a healing therapy for troubled and confused minds. Yes, talking and listening can be far more therapeutic than one could imagine. It is important that professionals who know how to help resolve the problems are informed with the least delay. People who have attempted to take their own life previously are more likely to attempt suicide again. Yet, counselling alone may not be able to cure the problems outright.
But it is an approach to finding a means of initially coping with the tortured mind. And it could possibly help in hitting on ways of resolving some of the concerns that may be contributing to a persons suicidal tendencies. The most frequently-used methods for suicides are pesticide poisoning, hanging and firearms.
But leaping off high-rise buildings and jumping in front of moving trains are common methods in highly urbanised areas in Asia. The shrinks all agree that there remains a lack of psycho-social care targeted at individuals, especially those traumatised by conflict experiences in Sri Lanka.
Besides, issues surrounding mental health remain stigmatised here, as they do everywhere in the world. This stigma surrounding mental health is not a Sri Lankan problem, it is a global one, but it needs to be dealt with here as urgently as anywhere. But the vital factor to remember is that it is not just those suffering from trauma that we need to worry about. Mental health is a problem that strikes people across all ages, all communities, all levels of society, whether they are rich or poor, successful or not, from happy or broken families, from cities or villages.
Certainly the framework for helping people with mental health problems has been put in place and that is a good thing, but the momentum must be maintained. Now, we need to work on constructing a society and a culture that understands mental health and try to understand why people commit suicide, and to do everything we can to support and help people get through their battles with depression.
The most important aspect of recovery from depression is support. If someone does not have a strong support network and then feels alone and worthless as a result of depression it is much harder to see the light at the end of the tunnel. You could be someones hero just by giving them a kind word, letting them cry on your shoulder and being brave enough to ask them if they are okay.
The worst that will happen if you ask a friend a colleague or loved one who seems in pain if they are considering suicide is that they will say no and know that you care enough about them to ask. If they say yes, you might have just saved a life. Hard questions might not be politically correct, but they can save lives. It is better to overreact than to lose a loved one or a friend.

The Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification by the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) is going to be made compulsory for all food and beverages products, by early 2019.
According to the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA), the GMP certification should be obtained by all producers of food and beverages (F&B). However, food and beverage producers who have already obtained SLSI certification such as ISO, HACCP and FSSC need not obtain the GMP certificate.
The CAA said food and beverage producers and those selling foods and beverages can apply for the GMP certificate by either visiting the Sri Lanka Standard Institution office or obtaining an application form online.
According to the CAA, the rule will be enforced from March 1, 2019. The CAA will take strict action against food and beverages producers who do not obtain the necessary certification from the SLSI.

God is in the machine
Ill lose my job if anyone knows about this.
There was a long silence which I didnt dare to break. I had begged to make this meeting happen. And now the person I had long been trying to meet leaned towards me. Someone is going to go through your book line by line, he said, to try to work out who I am.
Hed been a talented researcher, an academic, until his friend started a small technology company. He had joined the company and helped it to grow. It eventually became so big that the company had been acquired by one of the tech giants. And so, then, was he.
Legal documents
He was now paid a fortune to help design the algorithms that were central to what the tech giant did. And he had signed solemn legal documents prohibiting him from speaking to me, or to anyone, about his work. But as the years passed, his concern  indeed his guilt  grew. Its power without responsibility. He paused. Theres so much power, and so little responsibility. This is not notional abstract power. This is real power about day-to-day lives. Its both material and cultural and financial. The world has to know that this is how it works . . . Theres something rotten in the state of Denmark, he said, quoting Hamlet a little melodramatically.
So he had decided to take a risk. If they find out Im doing this, he said, Ill be marched out of my office and Ill never work in technology again. Thats the best-case scenario. He wasnt just going to talk to me about his work. He was going to show me it.
From his satchel, the researcher pulled out his laptop. He tapped for a few minutes and, with a sense of occasion, turned the screen to face me. Its all there. And there it was: a white screen with instructions neatly arranged in a series of boxes.
In [3] the first step says
In [8], in [9] says the next.
There were words in different colours, some green, some purple, some in red, in bold, in italics. I looked at the researcher, a proud grin spread across his face. There it was. An algorithm that really influenced peoples lives. And it was .<U+2009>.<U+2009>. totally underwhelming.
Twenty-three centuries ago, the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes sat in the Great Library of Alexandria and tried to find a way to identify prime numbers. He wrote every number from one to 100 in ten rows, and crossed out the one. He circled the two, crossed out all the multiples of two, circled the three and continued. He had created an algorithm, in essence something very simple. His sieve, as it was called, did what all algorithms do. It took an input, followed a series of well-described steps and produced an output. Input, process, output: thats all an algorithm is, and has ever been.
Astronomical calculations
Throughout their history, algorithms have been built to solve problems. They have been used to make astronomical calculations, build clocks and turn secret information into code. Up till the nineties, the researcher said, algorithms still tended to be RSAs  Really Simple Algorithms. Previously it was pretty clear how stuff happened. You take the original Google algorithm. It was basically a popularity study. Youd just surface (or rank more highly) things that people clicked on more. In general, the people who made it understood how the thing worked. Some algorithms were more complicated than others, but the input > process > output was generally transparent and understandable, at least to the people who built and used them.
The algorithm he had brought up on his screen was built to solve a problem, too. It ordered and organized reality in an important way, trying to separate what was important from what was irrelevant. But it was different from the RSAs. Its way more complicated than it looks, he said, hovering a pencil over some of the short words in square brackets. But I need to show you why. And with that, we started to journey through his creation.
First, it imported libraries, a specific language of definitions, instructions and actions. Next, he showed me how it brought in data. Theres a bit of a macho thing about feeding your algorithms as much data as possible, he said. The more data you feed it, the better. We work with a lot more data than most teams, actually, he said, drawing his cursor longingly over the script that brought the huge, churning quantities of data that fed the algorithm. Gigabytes, terabytes, petabytes of data were ordered, there on the page.

Growing crops without soil
With the rapid urbanization of Colombo the availability of natural soil has become a cause for concern in many cities. Since the nation seems to be running out of soil, there is one option and that is growing in liquid medium. Green Thumbs speaks to Agrarian Service Center, Maharagama, Agriculture Instructor Anuruddhika Perera on the Hydroponic System.
Its not uncommon for a plant in liquid fertilizer medium to grow at least 20 per cent faster than soil gardening. On top of that, plants will typically yield at least 25 per cent more than their soil counterparts.
In many cities in Colombo the lack of space is a problem. But the even bigger problem is the lack of soil. A solution is the Hydroponic System. There is a simple way of using this system in your extent of land with a Rigifoam or any other container that should be able to hold one liter of water. When we use this Hydroponic system there is no need for soil. This is because we are using the liquid medium. This liquid medium is the Liquid Fertilizer known as the Albert Solution, said Perera.
The Hydroponic technique is ideal for areas with limited spaces. The reason for faster growth rate and greater yield is because it is easy for the plant to get the nutrients they need to grow. When they have to struggle less to find pockets of water or nutrition like they would in soil, they can divert that energy to growth.
One thing we need is black polythene with a 0.15mm thickness. We then take the container and cover the bottom of the container with the black polythene cover. This is to create the darkness needed for the roots to grow. Because when the plant is growing in the soil, the roots are in darkness. Then the container is filled with the Albert Solution. The lid covering the container needs to have holes in proportion with the container. They also need to be big enough so that a plastic/ disposable cup can be fitted into them. After that we fill the cup with coir dust medium and plant the seeds in the cup. The cups are then fitted into the holes. The cups in turn need to have tiny holes so that the roots can go through them and access the liquid fertilizer. The roots absorb the fertilizer from the medium, explained Perera.
Perera also pointed out that there needs to be another hole in the lid so that ventilation can be provided. This hole needs to be covered by an insect prevention net, to protect against insects. The holes in the lid also need to have a proper distance from each other.
One reason we use chemical insecticides and chemicals is so that the insecticides can kill the insects and the chemicals can make the outside appearance of the vegetables and fruits look attractive. This Hydroponic system can be used for vegetables such as tomato, cabbage, radish, chili, bell pepper and salad cucumber. It can be used for fruits like melons and strawberries. It can be used for leafy vegetables like lettuce, Kang Kung and Gotukola. The Hydroponic system is an easy and simple technique. Strawberries are grown commercially in Nuwaraeliya and has a delicious taste and the quality and shape is good, pointed out Perera.
When preparing this liquid solution there needs to be ample morning sunlight. One must keep in mind that in one container only one crop needs to be grown. It is not difficult to get your hands on the Albert Mixture. It can be bought from an agro-chemical shop.
Perera added that one way of knowing that more fertilizer is needed is by judging the condition of the crops. The leaves turn to a yellow color, the green color decreases and the growth rate decreases. Then we know that more fertilizer is needed.
It is also important to observe the plant. This is so we can spot any pest attacks. If we see signs of a pest attack, we can remove the damaged plant parts. Or we can used an organic pesticide such as Neem extract or Neem oil, said Perera Another benefit is there is no weeding necessary. No soil means there are no weeds. It also saves you the time of weeding, pest control and watering. You also save up on watering because a plants roots will only take up the amount of water they need at any one time and leave the rest in the reservoir for later. The reservoir is covered to prevent evaporation and no water can seep out of the bottom. We need to keep in mind that the Hydroponic system gives one the ability to control the growth aspects of the plant, meaning you have more control. It is relatively inexpensive and easy to construct at home.
****
STEPS TO CREATE HYDROPONIC SYSTEM
Take black polythene with a 0.15mm thickness.
Take a container and cover the bottom of the container with the black polythene cover (This is to create the darkness needed for the roots to grow).
Then the container is filled with the Albert Solution.
The lid covering of the container needs to have holes in proportion with the container.
They also need to be big enough so that a plastic/ disposable cup can be fitted into them.
After that fill the cup with coir dust medium and plant the seeds in the cup.
The cups are then fitted into the holes so that the roots can go through them and access the liquid fertilizer.

I will vindicate Security Forces at UN - President
President Maithripala Sirisena said that he is scheduled to address the UN General Assembly on September 24 and he would make a statement to vindicate the Security Forces from all allegations levelled against them.
President Sirisena was speaking at the SLFP Nivitigala Bala Mandala meeting held at the Nivitigala public fair premises, on Saturday.
He said there is unnecessary concern in the country at present regarding the Presidential election and even though some people had made statements that there will be an early Presidential election, he is not ready in any way to hold a Presidential election before it is due.
President Sirisena also said that he alone could decide on holding such an election. If the SLPP and UNP overestimate their political power, that is a mistake and however high their expectations might be, no one could form a government without the support of the SLFP, President Sirisena said.
Political parties which emerge centring on individuals are temporary and the country needs political parties with clear vision. The SLFP which has a proper vision for the motherland is now moving forward successfully while strengthening its organisational structures, the President said.
According to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, after the next Presidential election, the powers of the President will be limited and the key position of the government will be the post of Prime Minister. Therefore, those in politics should be discussing the selection of a Prime Minister for the country, and not be concerned about the next Presidential election, President Sirisena said.
No matter what allegations are levelled against me by political opponents, I will continue to fulfill my duties toward the country, much more than anyone has done in the past, President Sirisena said.
He also said that he has created an environment where the common man could reach the highest level, while strengthening democracy and vesting the superior powers of the Executive Presidency in the Parliament, which no other leader in the world has done.
President Sirisena said that the true Bandaranaike policy and the policy of the SLFP is to always put the needs of the country first.
Although the main allegation against the SLFP is that it is joined with the UNP, it did so to fulfill some tasks which could not be fulfilled by the previous government and today, the government was able to win the support of the international community whose cooperation is now being used for the benefit of the country, he said.
Expressing his views regarding the development activities of the Ratnapura district, the President said that he will instruct the relevant authorities and the police to allow the people to engage in gem mining using kooda (cane baskets) in rivers and canals in the area, from this week.
The President, felicitating 10 senior SLFP members of the Ratnapura district, presented awards to them for their long contribution to the development of the SLFP.
Ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva and Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa, State Minister Weerakumara Dissanayake, Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Nivitigala SLFP organiser Miyuru Bhashitha Liyanage, Jagath Pushpakumara, and Athula Kumara Rahubadda and other SLFP activists participated in the event.
The President also opened the Nivitigala SLFP office.

Jadeja leads India fightback
London, Sunday: Ravindra Jadeja marked his return to India duty by top-scoring with 86 not out as Englands James Anderson was kept waiting for a landmark wicket at the Oval on Sunday.
Jadeja also shared a seventh-wicket stand of 77 with Hanuma Vihari, who made 56 on debut, as India finished on 292 all out -- just 40 runs behind Englands first innings 332.
England paceman Anderson took two for 54 in 21 overs to leave him two shy of Australia great Glenn McGraths record of 563 Test wickets, the most taken by any fast bowler.
At tea, England were 20 without loss in their second innings, a lead of 60 runs in the last of a five-match series they had already won at 3-1 up.
Alastair Cook, Englands all-time leading Test run-scorer, was 13 not out in his final innings before international retirement.
Keaton Jennings, who had earlier dropped India No 11 Jasprit Bumrah first ball when Jadeja had made just 56, was unbeaten on seven.
Before play started on Sunday, the International Cricket Council announced Anderson had been fined 15 percent of his match for speaking in an aggressive manner to umpire Kumar Dharmasena on Saturday after an lbw review against India captain Virat Kohli went the way of the star batsman.
Kohli eventually fell to Ben Stokes for 49, strengthening an England grip on the game established earlier in the day by Jos Buttler making 89 on his 28th birthday.
India resumed in trouble at 174 for six, with Vihari 25 not out and Jadeja, recalled in place of the injured Ravichandran Ashwin, unbeaten on eight.
The veteran new-ball duo of Stuart Broad and Anderson were straight into the attack on an overcast Sunday morning.
But Vihari, who came through a couple of close lbw incidents involving Broad when on nought, was increasingly assured as he completed an admirable fifty in 104 balls, including six fours and a six.
Stokes thought he had Jadeja caught behind for 28 but Dharmasena said not out and an England review confirmed that the Sri Lankan had made yet another good decision this match. AFP

Global IT Park Minami Uonuma, Japan celebrates second year anniversary
Japans first IT acceleration program to support SL IT companies
Global IT Park Minami Uonuma is Japans first IT acceleration programme to support Sri Lankan and foreign IT companies to develop next-generation technologies collaborating with Japanese companies. It was initiated by Adam Innovations Co. Ltd., together with Minami Uonuma City Council, Prefectural Government and International University of Japan, said President Adam Innovations Co. Ltd., and Founder/CEO of Global IT Park Minami Uonuma, Kaushal Wawlagala.
Today, every business is a digital business. In every industry, traditional business models and processes are being transformed by the spread of new digital technologies and the rise of disruptive threats. If electricity is transformed manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution, the impact of digital technology today, is even greater. Digital Technologies are changing the constraints under which every business operates and practices innovation. We started Global IT Park in 2016, to support this endeavor. Many Japanese companies today, embrace digital technologies and seek new business models to thrive in this digital economy. However, it is not easy for them to do so by themselves. They need global tech partners, especially in the software side, he said.
We see that there is a great window of opportunity for Sri Lankan IT companies to penetrate into the Japanese market. Most Sri Lankan IT companies start looking at foreign markets from day one. They are good at following global technology trends, while being capable of developing cutting-edge technologies. They also have gained necessary experience and exposure working with foreign countries such as the US and Europe. Our main idea is to help such IT companies to come to Japan and collaboratively work with Japanese companies, he said.
Until recently, Japanese companies outsourced software development to China and Vietnam to reduce their cost of operations. But today, software becomes the game changer. It drives the innovation both inside and outside of the company. Software-driven business models change the way business operates. For example, Japans number one industry today is automotive. Companies such as Toyota, Honda and Nissan, dominates the worlds automotive Industry. However, while the automotive industry today is undergoing a major transformation. Cars are turning into electric and gasoline engines are becoming obsolete. This will remove many automotive part manufacturers out of business. But, the biggest change is yet to come. That is the introduction of autonomous vehicles (driverless cars). In a driverless car, the software cost of the production is much higher than the hardware cost. This would become a large threat to traditional car makers such as Toyota and Nissan to compete with tech giants such as Google, Apple, Uber, as they are much stronger in software. Therefore, Japanese companies today are heavily investing in software technologies to retain their position, he said.
New technologies such as IoT, Machine Learning and other digital technologies are transforming businesses around the world. In Global IT Park, we support such tech companies to visit Japan and develop disruptive technologies for Japanese companies. Most of our projects are R & D level at the moment. For testing and commercialization phases, we try to take those projects to countries such as Sri Lanka and India, where we could bring many Japanese companies to Sri Lanka to embark on their new product development.
Global IT Park Minami Uonuma, Japan, celebrated its second year anniversary recently.
Our idea is that during the next decade, technologies would be more software driven, while hardware alone, does not add much value. We strongly believe that Global IT Park could help many Japanese companies to transform. We are getting plenty of attention from both the Japanese multinationals and SMEs, he said.
Global IT Park was initiated with a broad vision to attract 350 companies around the world. At its inception, we had 5 foreign IT companies from India and Sri Lanka, while today it has increased up to 8 companies. I am happy to say that there are 6 Sri Lankan IT companies among them, he added.

JLL provides insight into impact of imposition  of VAT on condominium sales
In the wake of continuing uncertainty with regard to the effective date on the reintroduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) on residential condominiums, leading global real-estate consulting agency, Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) released a new report analyzing the likely impact of impending policy changes on the Sri Lankan real estate sector.
Following the announcement of amendments to the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14, of 2002, (Amendment Act No. 25 of 2018) certified by the Speaker on 16 August 2018, and the termination of the exemption of VAT on the supply of residential accommodation, other than lease or rent, it would appear that all sales of condominium properties in Sri Lanka, over Rs. 15 million, now attract VAT at 15% of the sale price, in addition to Stamp Duty and NBT, effective from August 16, 2018.
However, the report noted that the industry is currently rife with speculation that further government announcements may clarify the effective date of imposition as April 1, 2019.
This only adds to confusion over government policy and fuels industry wide gloom, compounded by a lack of clarity and consistency from policy makers. While it is difficult to find anyone who welcomes the removal of the exemption, and, therefore imposition of VAT on residential sales, with immediate effect, equally, history tells us that a fake gold rush of sales, to beat the deadline, if 1 April is confirmed, followed by a dramatic fall off, afterwards, is just as unwelcome, the report said.
In that context, JLL said that the fact that such major changes to fundamental policies continued to proceed in fits and starts has thrown further doubt over proceedings and reduced transparency as to the intended outcomes of these policies and to what extent the industrys varied stakeholder considerations had impacted policy.
Is the VAT levy purely a revenue gathering exercise or an attempt to manipulate the market by dampening demand in the higher reaches of the condominium market and, if so, why This confusion undermines confidence, and confidence is the key to any market, be that real estate, or any other product, so, if the intention is to raise revenue, the VAT measure is counter-productive, and, if it is intended to dampen demand, when absorption rates, for luxury condominiums, currently averages 50% in Colombo, why would the government want to see stalled development projects and vacant development plots littering the Colombo environment the report queried.
Even if in the alternative, the Governments unstated aim with these policy amendments was to concentrate developer focus on low cost and social housing, for social policy reasons, JLL warned that continuing policy uncertainty would only create barriers to the commercial development of such properties when combined with continuing land price speculation and a serious gap in public transport infrastructure.
In order to shed more light on the likely impact of this impending shift in taxation policy, JLL drew parallels to the experiences of other countries in the ASEAN region that had recently imposed rafts of real estate taxes. While the report acknowledged the significant variance in relation to underlying rationale in other geographies, JLL nevertheless emphasized the value of such comparison, particularly given that the most prominent rationale for such moves as in Sri Lanka had been to rein in rampant market growth while promoting socio economic policy.
In that regard, the report noted that the Indonesian government introduced a revised luxury tax of 20% on units over IDR10 billion in 2015, resulting in weak sales and subdued market conditions in the luxury sector, impacting both new unit launches and resulting sales.
In Jakarta, in 2016, 11,000 units were released for sale and sales numbered 10,500. In 2017, only 3,500 new units were launched and sales slumped to some 4,000 transactions, a fall of 68% and 62% respectively while sentiments are predicted to remain subdued, with flat, or falling, prices, on both primary and secondary markets, especially given that the Indonesian market is heavily skewed to local demand.
Although the population of the urban municipality of Jakarta exceeds 10 million and the market dynamics differ to Colombo, these statistics may correlate closely to condominium sales in the commercial capital, as 95% of demand originates from Sri Lankan residents and ex pats, the report said.

Nikhil Poojary (36th minute) opened the scoring and Manvir Singh (44th) doubled the lead right before the break to help India finish with six points and set up a semi-final date with Group A runners-up Pakistan. Both Nikhil and Manvir scored their first international goals.
The second semi-finalists was decided by the toss of a coin because both Sri Lanka and Maldives had tied with the same number of points. Maldives won the toss and they will play Nepal in the first semi-final on 12 September at the same venue.
The referee and the linesmen gave a poor display which enabled India to take the lead.
Sri Lanka failed to qualify for the semi-finals due to referees mistakes. The FFSL intends writing a protest letter to the AFC and FIFA regarding the poor quality of refereeing.

Lankan drug trafficker arrested in Thailand
Thai Police arrested a Sri Lankan wanted for drug trafficking in Sri Lanka. The suspect Saliya Perera, a resident of Hikkaduwa, was arrested on September 7 in Thailand based on an Interpol red warrant issued against him, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
The Police Spokesman told the Daily News that on November 5, 2013, a Liberian national was apprehended by the BIA Customs officers while attempting to smuggle 30 kgs of heroin out of the country.
The case was handed over to the Police Narcotics Bureau and they commenced the investigations. During the course of the investigations, it was revealed that four Sri Lankan nationals were involved in this case for aiding and abetting the Liberian national. The PNB obtained an Interpol Red Alert against the Sri Lankan suspects. One of the suspects was arrested a few years ago and Saliya Perera was evading arrest and was in hiding in Thailand.
The Bangkok Post reported that Saliya Perera was apprehended in front of the Narathiwas Residence Hotel on Sathu Pradit Soi 19 in the Chong Nonsi area. Officers had asked him to produce his passport and found that he was wanted on an Interpol red notice.
Officers from the Immigration Bureau, the Tourist Police Bureau, the Patrol and Special Operations Divsion and other agencies had been tracking the suspects whereabouts following a request by Sri Lankan authorities to country members of Interpol.
Interrogation revealed that Saliya Perera had entered Thailand on a tourist visa in late 2013. He renewed his visa regularly until 2016 until he found that he was wanted on an Interpol red notice.
At that point, he told investigators, he stopped renewing his visa for fear of being arrested. SP Gunasekara said the PNB had also presented facts to the Negombo Magistrates Court for the arrest of the other two suspects involved in the case.

Is living in a city affecting your childs MEMORY
Children raised in leafier areas of towns or cities could do better at school because their brains develop differently.
Research shows 11-year-olds brought up in urban areas with more trees have more grey matter in part of the brain which affects concentration and maths ability.
The boost in grey matter means the children have a better spatial working memory, which is responsible for understanding their surroundings and spatial awareness.
And this type of memory is linked to how children do at school, researchers say, so those raised in greener areas could have an advantage over their urban peers.
Plants are thought to help the brain develop because they are less demanding to look at and hear than man-made surroundings, so are less likely to tire the brain.
The scientists say their findings emphasize how important it is for architects and governments to include green space in neighbourhoods in towns and cities.
The study by University College London studied the spatial working memory of 4,758 11-year-olds living in towns and cities in England.It revealed those who live in concreted areas without much greenery have a worse working memory than those in leafier areas.
Spatial working memory is essentially people's ability to record information about what they can sense around them.
It affects their ability to adapt to new surroundings, to remember what they've seen and where things are, to find objects or places, and to remember information while carrying out unrelated tasks. It's also closely linked to the capacity to pay attention and focus on things, as well as mathematical skill  both of which are vital to doing well at school.
Study author Professor Eirini Flouri said: 'Spatial working memory is an important cognitive ability that is strongly related with academic achievement in children  particularly mathematics performance.
'Our findings suggest a positive role of green space in [brain] functioning.
'Exposure to natural, green settings restores attentional resources by imposing fewer demands on visual or auditory processing.
'Prolonged periods requiring the use of 'directed' attention result in mental fatigue, which is characterised by feeling irritable and being easily distracted.'
Professor Flouri added that green space can also improve the health and wellbeing of parents, which in turn improves the lives of their children.
She said the team's findings support a case for having more outdoor learning at school and encouraging architects and planners to maintain parks and open space.
And the same effects are seen regardless of whether neighbourhoods are rich or poor, showing green space can have benefits wherever it is.
To find their results the British researchers used children from the Millenium Cohort Study  children born in 2000 or 2001 whose development has been tracked since.
They measured the amount of green space in a child's neighbourhood by looking at the area on Google Maps.
This was then compared with how well the children performed on spatial working memory tests, such as having to remember a shape or colour which flashed up on a screen.
Children living in less green areas performed worse on the tests, and vice versa.
And the results were not affected by poverty, parents' education, sports participation or neighbourhood deprivation.
Professor Flouri said hers is the first study to examine the association in children between neighbourhood green space and this particular aspect of working memory.
The findings add to studies across the world suggesting that growing up in leafier surroundings aids mental development.
A Spanish team found children living near parks, gardens or woodland  or going to schools with lots of greenery around  were a year ahead of their 'urban jungle' counterparts.
Professor Flouri added: 'Neighbourhoods with green space are thought to make their adult residents healthier, fitter and slimmer.
'However, there has been relatively little research into the role of green space for children  especially for outcomes in the cognitive domain.
'This is unfortunate because there are certainly many reasons why exposure to green space would have benefits for them.'
The team's findings were published in the British Journal of Educational Psychology.

Majority not always right
A Supreme Court constitution bench last Thursday pronounced a unanimous verdict  in four concurring judgments  scrapping the provisions of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalise unnatural sex between consenting adults, and was effectively used to criminalise homosexual relations in India for more than a century.
The judgment decriminalises sexual acts between consensual adults and brings the curtains down on a decade-long legal struggle that saw the Delhi high court first strike down Section 377 as unconstitutional only to have the Supreme Court bring it back into play. The parts of Section 377 pertaining to sex with animals and children will remain, the court said.
On Thursday, four separate but concurring judgments were delivered, authored by CJI Misra, Justice Chandrachud, Justice Nariman and Justice Malhotra. The chief justice began by reading the judgment by him and Justice Khanwilkar, saying, according to Live Law, Section 377 is arbitrary. The LGBT community possesses rights like others. Majoritarian views and popular morality cannot dictate constitutional rights. We have to vanquish prejudice, embrace inclusion and ensure equal rights.
The bench has overruled the Supreme Court order in the Suresh Kumar Koushal case, which re-criminalised unnatural sex, Bar and Bench quoted CJI Misra as saying. Sexual orientation of an individual is natural and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a violation of freedom of expression, the court said. The provision of IPC had resulted in collateral effect in that consensual sex between LGBT persons is criminalised, and is violative of Article 14, Supreme Court.
Right to live with dignity
Justice Nariman delivered his judgment next, saying that the Suresh Kumar Koushal was no longer good law in view of the NALSA and Puttaswamy judgments. He also said that homosexuality cannot be regarded as mental disorder and homosexuals have the right to live with dignity.
Justice Chandrachud delivered his judgment after Justice Nariman, saying, Section 377 inflicts tragedy and anguish; it has to be remedied.
This case is much more than just decriminalising a provision. It is about an aspiration to realise constitutional rights and equal existence of LGBT community as other citizens, Chandrachud continued. He too brought up the right to privacy judgment from last year, To deny the LGBT community of their right to sexual orientation is a denial of their citizenship and a violation of their privacy. They cannot be pushed into obscurity by an oppressive colonial legislation.
He added that IPC Section 377 has been destructive to the LGBT identity.
Justice Malhotra read out her judgment last, saying that history owes an apology to those who have been persecuted and socially ostracised because of Section 377.
Earlier in July this year, a five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra said it will also examine the correctness of its 2013 verdict that had set aside the Delhi High Court judgement decriminalising gay sex. The apex court had in 2013 restored sexual relationship between persons of the same sex as a criminal offence by setting aside the 2009 Delhi High Court judgement that had held as unconstitutional section 377 of the IPC, which makes such actions between two consenting adults of same sex as a penal offence. During the hearing today, the bench, also comprising Justices R F Nariman, A M Khanwilkar, D Y Chandrachud and Indu Malhotra, said it would examine the constitutional validity of section 377 of the IPC and the fundamental rights of the LGBTQ (Lesbians, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer) community.
The bench said the curative petitions filed by it have a limited scope and would have to be heard by some other bench. It was on the petition filed by the Naaz Foundation that the Delhi High Court had decriminalised section 377 of the IPC, which was challenged in the apex court by some individuals and religious organisations. Even the Centre had at that time favoured retention of the provision in the IPC as penal offence. Thursdays hearing began with senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for dancer Navtej Jauhar, one of the petitioners, telling the court that the right to have sexual freedom should be examined in view of the nine-judge bench verdict on privacy which was delivered on August 24, 2017. In the judgement on privacy as a fundamental right, the apex courts nine-judge bench had said the right to privacy cannot be denied to members of the LGBT community merely because they have unconventional sexual orientation and form a miniscule fraction of the over 1.32 billion Indian population.
Modi government did not oppose petitions
During the hearing, the Narendra Modi government told the Supreme Court that it will not be opposing the petitions challenging Section 377. Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that the government will be leaving the decision to the court, but asked that the court not rule on related matters such as marriage rights for the LGBT community.
In the most respectful submission of the Union of India, allowing any other issue (other than constitutional validity of Section 377) to be argued and adjudicating the same with giving an opportunity to the Union of India to file a counter affidavit to the Union of India may not be in the interest of justice and would be violative of principles of natural justice, the Centres affidavit said.

These were the 64 words of Section 377 in the IPC which the court was deliberating on:
Unnatural offences.Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with 1[imprisonment for life], or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine. ExplanationPenetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the offence described in this section.

In a statement, the Indian Psychiatric Association said, In the opinion of the Indian Psychiatric Association, homosexuality is not a psychiatric disorder. This is in line with the position of the American Psychiatric Association and the International Classification of Diseases of the World Health Organization which removed homosexuality from the list of psychiatric disorders in 1973 and 1992 respectively.
The IPS recognises same sexuality as a normal variant of human sexuality much like heterosexuality and bisexuality. There is no scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be altered by any treatment and that any such attempts may, in fact, lead to low self-esteem and stigmatisation of the person.
****
Chief Justice of India observes
* No one can escape from their individualism. Society is now better for individualism. In the present case, our deliberations will be on various spectrums.
* Sustenance of identity is the pyramid of life
* Morality cannot be martyred at the altar of social morality. Only Constitutional morality exists in our country.
* Sexual orientation is one of many biological phenomenon. It is natural and no discrimination can exist. Any violation is against freedom of speech and expression.

More Italian business ventures for Lanka - Ambassador
Since the Sri Lankan economy is growing fast, the influx of more Italian and other foreign investors in the country to commence new business ventures has significantly increased during the past several years.
Sri Lankas Italian Ambassador Paolo Andrea Bartorelli was addressing the 19th AGM of the Sri Lanka Italy Business Council (SLIBC) held in Colombo. SLIBC, former President Rajah Abeysinghe and the newly elected President Sonali Liyanamanna were present.
Ambassador Bartorelli highlighted that the Italian Embassy in Sri Lanka always extended its fullest cooperation to strengthen the bilateral relationship between the two countries.
He said a large number of Sri Lankans were living in Italy and this was a fine testimony to strengthen the relationship between the two nations.
Ambassador Bartorell said the significant increase of the arrival of Italian tourists to Sri Lanka and vice versa also showed the close rapport between the two countries.
He said the coming up of new buildings in Colombo and suburban areas reflect the speedy development in Sri Lanka.
Even the Italian, European and Western ambassadors are highly confident over the current progress and such a situation encourages foreign investors to invest in the country. SLIBC, President Rajah Abeysinghe highlighted that both exports and imports between the two countries record an all-time high in 2017, but there was a decrease in investor and consumer sentiment due to the impact of adverse weather conditions.
He said currently there is a growth in tourism, logistics and, infrastructure in the country and many foreign delegations express their willingness in investing here.
He said during that period exports had increased by 29.5% while imports increased only by 13.5% and this situation resulted in a positive trade balance of Rs 34, 275 million in 2017. He said there was an increase in tourist arrivals from 24,293 in 2016 to 31,428 in 2017.
Newly elected President Sonali Liyanamanna said We have many investment opportunities in Europe and have to identify the avenues of renewable energy, E- commerce, medical tourism, research and development and Technology.

Naomi Osaka wins US Open after Serena umpire thief meltdown
NEW YORK, Sunday - Naomi Osaka became the first Japanese to win a Grand Slam singles title on Saturday as her idol Serena Williams angrily imploded, calling the chair umpire in the US Open final a thief.
Osaka, 20, triumphed 6-2, 6-4 in the match marred by Williams's second set outburst, the American enraged by umpire Carlos Ramos's warning for receiving coaching from her box.
When a second code violation for racquet abuse was handed out to her -- along with a point penalty -- Williams exploded.
She tearfully accused him of being a thief and angrily demanded an apology from the official.

You're attacking my character, she said. You will never, ever be on another court of mine. You are the liar, she fumed and Ramos handed her a game penalty for a third violation -- verbal abuse -- that put Osaka one game from victory at 5-3 in the second set.
Williams won the next game, and continued her tearful remonstrations with a supervisor on the changeover.
But Osaka -- who displayed not only a stellar game but remarkable poise throughout -- held serve to seal a historic win for her country.
It doesn't really feel that real right now. Maybe in a few days I'll realize what I've done, said Osaka, adding that the noise was so great in Arthur Ashe Stadium and her focus so single-minded that she wasn't fully aware of the escalating controversy.
When I turned around it was 5-3 so I was a little bit confused then, she said of the game suddenly awarded to her. I felt like I had to focus. She's such a great champion so I know she can come back from any point. Williams, seeking a first Grand Slam title since the birth of her daughter Olympia on September 1 2017, was denied a 24th Grand Slam title that would have matched Margaret Court's all-time record.
As the pro-Williams crowed booed the trophy ceremony announcer, Osaka was tearing up herself, but Williams urged the spectators to show the young champion respect.
She played well, Williams said, pausing to compose herself. This is her first Grand Slam. Let's make this the best moment we can.
When it was Osaka's turn she seemed at a loss, apologizing to the crowd.
It was always my dream to play Serena in the US Open finals, she added, turning to Williams herself.
I'm really grateful I was able to play with you, thank you.
Williams's outburst overshadowed an outstanding performance from Osaka, who made her second career title a Grand Slam after winning her first at Indian Wells in March. A match with history at stake for both players got off to a tense start and it was Williams who blinked first, double-faulting on break point to give Osaka a 2-1 lead.
After a confident hold punctuated by a 106 mph ace Osaka broke again to lead 4-1, silencing the crowd.
They came to life again as Williams gained her first break chance, which Osaka saved with a 117 mph service winner. Williams squandered one more chance before Osaka sealed the hold with another big serve.
I DON'T CHEAT
It was in the second game of the second set that Williams was warned for receiving coaching, a charge she vigorously denied.
I don't cheat to win, she said. I'd rather lose.
Coach Patrick Mouratoglou admitted in an interview with ESPN that he was trying to advise her with a hand gesture, although Williams was apparently oblivious.
The star of the show has been once again the chair umpire, he tweeted.
Should they be allowed have an influence on the result of a match When do we decide that this should never happen again
Williams was up 2-1 on the changeover when she spoke again with Ramos appearing to smooth things over, and she finally found a way to break Osaka for a 3-1 lead.
The tranquility didn't last long. When Osaka broke back with the aid of two double faults and a backhand into the net from Williams, the American smashed her racquet to the court. A second code violation came with a point penalty to start the next game that sent her into orbit.
I didn't get coaching. I haven't cheated in my life. I stand for what's right, insisted Williams as they headed into the sixth game -- in which Osaka held at love.
After Osaka broke for a 4-3 lead Williams continued her verbal assault on Ramos, who docked her a game for a third violation that put Osaka up 5-3.
The scene recalled Williams's ugly rant at a line judge in her US Open semi-final loss to Kim Clijsters in 2009 and her verbal attack on chair umpire Eva Asderaki in her 2011 final loss to Samantha Stosur.
Williams said she didn't know if she would have managed to turn things around if the dispute with Ramos had not occurred.
It's hard to say because I always fight till the end and I always try to come back, no matter what.  AFP

## Title: A new blood test for autism spectrum disorder

A new blood test for autism spectrum disorder
A new blood test for autism can diagnose children that previously were missed by even the best developed screens for the set of disorders.
There are already a handful of tests for the disorder, which affects one in 45 American children, but there are also many unknowns to autism that make it hard for doctors to diagnose it with absolute certainty.
Behavior and an older diagnostic test can catch more than 90 percent of cases of autism, but aren't widely used, and the new test detects about 17 percent of children who belong to a subset of the spectrum that might have been missed previously.
Researchers at the University of California, Davis, developed their new screening method through the largest autism spectrum disorder study to-date.
Until recently, there has not been a biological test for children on the spectrum.
Children have previously been diagnosed based on their altered behaviors, which may not become evident until children are two to four years old.
And families often have to wait to see a specialist for a more in-depth assessment, which should be started within three months of the referral but can take longer.
But in February, the a scientists unveiled a blood test that had blown even them away with its accuracy.
And since, a slew of similar screening methods have come out.
Now, the University of California, Davis, scientists have identified a group of blood metabolites that could help detect some children with ASD.
The new biomarker panel could accelerate autism diagnoses as about 17 percent of kids with autism we re identified with the metabolic blood test. This could speed up children having intensive behavioral therapy at an earlier age.
Dr David Amaral, of the University of California Davis MIND Institute, said: 'With this panel of alterations in amino acid metabolism, we can detect about 17 percent of kids with ASD.
'This is the first of hopefully many panels that will identify other subsets of kids with autism.'
The findings were based on the largest metabolomic ASD study ever attempted - the Children's Autism Metabolome Project (CAMP).
CAMP researchers believed the answer lies in the metabolome - the molecules that remain after larger molecules have been broken down (metabolized).
Metabolomics has the advantage of monitoring both genetic and environmental contributions to the development of autism.
So far, some 65 genes related to autism have been identified, and there may be more left to discover - which is not to mention the environmental factors at play.
'Autism is not a single entity, it's a diverse spectrum,' says Dr Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, and father to a daughter on that spectrum.
'It is difficult to imagine how there could be a single blood tes tfor it,' he says.
So the new test may fit into a larger constellation of such screens for autism.
Dr Amaral, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences explained: 'By the time you're getting to metabolomics, you're looking at how the body is working, not just the genes it has.'
'It is unlikely that a single marker will detect all autism.'
But the new test might be able to catch cases of autism that others would miss.
'This paper demonstrates that alterations in metabolic profiles can detect sizable subsets of individuals with autism,' said Dr Amaral.
'The hope is that we will be able to generate a panel of biomarkers that will detect a large proportion of people at risk.
'Moreover, this approach highlights metabolic pathways that may be targets of intervention.'
