Over 3,000 quack dentists in service now
Former President of the General Dental Practitioners Association Dr. Hilary Cooray said 3,000 fake dentists operate in the country and they use forged registrations numbers to prove their credentials.
He was addressing the media at the Dental Awards 2018 organised to honour and recognise professionals in the dental industry at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre,
Over 3,000 dentists have registered with the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) but only 2,500 dentists are active, he said.
Many now in the field were not real doctors but those who served as assistants to the dentists. The real ones need to be registered with the SLMC and have to display the registration numbers.
Even the registered number was printed on their prescriptions to state that they are qualified doctors, Dr. Cooray said. He said the quack dentists could also display a number to claim that they were registered with the SLMC. He added that the best way to check is to see if their names were registered at the SLMC. He added that it was very hard to pursue legal action against them.
He said he was aware of these issues after seeing a stream of patients who had gone to these dentists.
They have come to police stations to lodge complaints against these dentists, he said. Patients complain that they cannot go to courts and waste their time and money. Our association advises people to be aware of quacks, he said

Alert on usage of non degradable polythene bags
The continuous issuing of non degradable polythene bags to customers by several super markets and business enterprises free of charge was brought to the attention of President Maithripala Sirisena by a leading compostable and biodegradable bags manufacturer, the Plastic Packaging (Pte) Ltd (PPP).
This was revealed by PPP, Chairman Dr Mervyn Dias at a media briefing held at PPP Auditorium, Ratmalana. The conference was held to create awareness of the companys participation at the recently concluded Presidential Environment Awards 2018 Exhibition, held at BMICH under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Several other environmental protection organizations and importers of compostable resin including the Sri Lanka Bioplastic Association, manufacturers of environmentally products to replace plastics and the Central Environmental Authority represented the exhibition. When President Sirisena visited the PPP stall, Dias displayed some reusable compostable and biodegradable bags and said the bags contain 100 per cent zero polythene.
He told the President that after using the bags it gets composted in the open environment within 180 days.
He also mentioned that the bag has triple usage that could be used for shopping many times, to store food and vegetables in the refrigerator and finally in the kitchen bin to collect biodegradable waste.
Dias said it is pathetic that some supermarkets and other business enterprises still issue more than 40 million polythene bags every month and such bags take nearly 500 years to degrade in the environment. He also advised customers to take their own reusable bags to supermarkets and help to reduce the usage of polythene bags.

Allianz tops  Dow Jones  Sustainability  Index 2018
The Allianz Group has taken the leading position among all rated insurance companies in the latest Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).
This is the second consecutive time the Group has achieved this feat. In the results of the worlds most relevant sustainability index, published recently, Allianz was ranked with 85 points well above the average sector scoring of 47points.
Since 2000, the company has been part of the DJSI which assesses environ-mental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. Only the most sustainable of the 2,500 companies in the Dow Jones Global Total Stock Market Index (DJGTSM) are listed.
Commenting on the prestigious achievement, Surekha Alles, Managing Director Allianz Insurance Lanka, said, As a responsible insurer, investor and employer it is gratifying to have our focus on ecological, social and governance criteria acknowledged by external sustainability experts. It further validates our commitment to sustainability as we continue to set ambitious goals for ourselves and contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals both here in Sri Lanka and across the globe.
Allianz creates measurable ecological and social added value through, among other things, sustainable products, climate-friendly business operations and social engagement.
By joining the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), Allianz has set itself long-termgoals for climate protection. In the future, the two-degree target of the Paris Climate Agreement will be integrated into the investment of insurance customers premiums. To this end, all tradable investments are to be structured climate-neutrally by 2050.
In order to support this long-term transformation towards a low-carbon economy, Allianz is in active dialogue with companies to define and implement their own climate protection targets.
The first step is being taken in four particularly energy-intensive sectors, including the transportation sector. In the energy sector of the portfolio, the threshold value for the maximum coal content will be lowered from 30 percent to 25 percent by December 31.
The threshold refers to the revenue that mining companies generate by mining coal, or to the percentage of electricity generated from coal by energy companies. The measures continue Allianzs ESG scoring approach, which is currently applied to companies with high ESG risks.
Allianz is currently working with recognized climate experts, non-governmental organizations and committed companies within SBTi to develop marketable analysis tools for investors to integrate the two-degree target.
Many companies are still unable to make precise statements about their greenhouse gas emissions or those of their supply chain due to a lack of data and procedures.

Art of capturing
Unlike any other visual image, a photograph is not a rendering, an imitation or an interpretation of its subject, but actually a trace of it. No painting or drawing, however naturalist, belongs to its subject in the way that a photograph does.
You dont need a camera to take a photograph these days. Most mobile phones come with a camera and a million and one ways to instantly upload and share your work with anyone you choose. The magic of a photograph is somewhat lost when its posted on Twitter or Facebook five seconds after it was taken.
Formed in 1950, the National Photographic Art Society of Sri Lanka serves the photographic community in an extraordinary manner. A brainchild of Wilson Hegoda, the Society initially catered to the Sinhala speaking photographer community, and later initiated photography classes not only to its members but also to the students from schools across the country, free; as a community project and then leading on to a recognized Diploma.
The Societys Education Director, Rahul Perera, shares insights on why photography must be studied as a specialized subject.
Q: Photography is better known as a profession than asubject to be studied.
A: Photography is a practical subject. If someone chooses this subject, they need to deal with the practical as well as the theoretical aspects. But the practical aspect comes with certain issues. The major issue is expenses on one hand. On the other hand, the amateurs do not get an opportunity to get along with the professionals in the field. The phenomenon is different in the global context.
Q: Would you elaborate on the global context
A: Any amateur is welcome to serve as an assistant in a professionals studio. But that is not a full-time job. Such jobs are available on a temporary basis. That said, most undergraduates make use of that opportunity, maybe for four hours a day.
Unfortunately, the Sri Lankan undergraduates hardly have an opportunity for part-time employment. The attitude also matters. Most undergraduates are not bothered about a part-time job, because their ambition is simple. Study with parental sponsorship and then apply for some job. On the other hand, many employers are also interested only in recruiting full-time employees.
This situation leaves us with many issues. The amateurs have no funds to invest in relevant equipment. Their only gateway to professionalism is a workshop. I honestly believe that our education system should be revamped with the influence of the global education system.
Q: We are not short of workshops. In fact, many workshops on miscellaneous subjects have mushroomed in the recent future. Your comment
A: Most of such workshops are professional. The professional workshops have one sole objective: making money. That fee is beyond the financial capacity of an average student or an undergraduate. That is why Sri Lanka National Photographic Art Association has organized a number of workshops at a nominal fee in addition to free seminars. Most workshops are organized at the minimum expenditure. The contribution fee is borne by resource persons. They share their knowledge free of charge.
If we had to pay them as well, we would not be in a position to hold the workshops at a nominal fee. Our resource persons are experts in the field.
Q: The course duration is three years. Organising the whole course is tasked with the second year undergraduates. Why them in particular
A: The first year undergraduates are clueless about the subject. They are not empowered with any experience either. The third-year students are busy preparing for the dissertation. So the second year is a relatively free year. So they are in a comfortable position to organize a workshop of this nature during the second year. They provide an opportunity for the first year students to get an idea. But the priority is given to the first year students.
Q: The Diploma duration is three years. How do you guarantee the knowledge capacity within that period
A: The first year student is introduced to the fundamental theories and history of photography. Approaching the second year, they are well positioned to identify a photograph in a specialized manner. The second year is allocated to a more practical purpose. They come to terms with the theoretical knowledge they received during the first year. The third year is beyond both theory and practice. They need to choose their journey: whether it is artistic, commercial or professional.
Q: The first year students may be clueless. But there could be students with a considerable knowledge. All of them have to sit together and study Isnt it unfair to a certain extent
A: Of course yes. However, remember this is carried out free of charge on a voluntary basis. Something free of charge on a voluntary basis is no piece of cake in an economic situation such as what we have right now. We need to find teachers. We need to find resource persons.
If we have to think about the two categories that you mentioned, then we have to double up our search. That is beyond the capacity for a voluntary organization.
On the other hand, it is good that these two categories get along with each other. The clueless students can take some clue from their more literate peers.

Professional skill - the blessings at the Cancer Hospital, Maharagama
Patients and loved ones experience the true meaning of Apeksha when they enter this place.
It happened to me. The name Cancer Hospital put me off at first. This was going by my visits to see patients long time ago. But on my most recent visit I was amazed at the change. The very appearance, cleanliness, the smiling faces of the staff and their readiness to help the helpless and above all the professional skill, which mixed with kind words and commitment boosted my morale. The impression I have had all these years became history as I walked in.
The individual files of the outdoor patients, the pharmacy, the rooms for injections are all so well organised that you need not waste time searching for records. The doctors are punctual for clinics. They encourage patients to get treatment there which is free of charge unless it is a major surgery which may involve an affordable sum.
The service includes the services of the minor staff as well. Cleaners start their work early in the morning and do all the rounds before they finish for the day. The food is substantial and has the necessary nutrients for the patients and is always served on time.
A big step in the achievements of Apeksha is the setting up of the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit. Bone marrow treatment was earlier limited only to those who could afford the treatment abroad which was a very disheartening factor to those who could not afford it. Others which belonged to the majority had to be satisfied with the short life span left for them without this treatment. The team of consultants who conducted the necessary research braved this challenging task amidst their day-to-day commitments and have done a wonderful job, giving new life to patients who would otherwise have to give up all hopes of life. You can see all details regarding this when you access the website http://www.bmtsrilanka.org/. You will be inspired when you read the details and be proud of our very own Sri Lankan doctors dedicating themselves to save lives.
The public admires and appreciates these immensely supportive endeavours. People from all walks of life most willingly donate highly expensive medicine such as drugs given for chemotherapy and other necessary injections. There are many voluntary groups that come there to prepare tea in large quantities and take them to serve each and every patient in the hospital.

Dental Tourism a new segment to the Sri Lanka leisure sector is been added by ORAM (PVT) Ltd, a supplier of dental equipment and services in Sri Lanka.
Managing Director, ORAM, Mushtaq Jabir told Daily News Business that Full Mouth Rehab (FMR) is a popular dental treatment in Europe and Middle East which close around Rs. 10 million to perform. This is because its a very time consuming process to perform a FMR on a patient.
He said that back in Sri Lanka clinical chargers are low in comparison to Europe and a FMR could be completed for around RS. 2.5 million in Sri Lanka. He said that ORAM with several private dental Clinics have now completed over 200 FMR on Europeans and Australians and now want to perform this in a more organised manner. What we now plan is to offer a comprehensive one week FMR Medical package including air ticket, hotel accommodation, travelling and domestic tours. He said that several hotels and more rural dental clinics are now been identified to launch this package. He said that they will also hold special seminars and update the knowledge of dentists and support staff to increase the number of points where FRM could be conducted.
Currently there are around 100 dentists who are engaged in performing FRM most of them are from the Western Province. The objective of full mouth rehabilitation is not only the reconstruction and restoration of the worn out dentition, but also maintenance of the health of the entire stomatognathic system. (SS)

E-bike sector needs adequate exposure - Chrysantha Fernando
The e-bike sector in Sri Lanka needs adequate exposure to pick up pace in growth, said Managing Director, Eco Trans Lanka Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd, Chrysantha Fernando.
He said that Electric vehicles are exactly what the doctor has ordered as the best economical mode of travelling as fuel prices are still high all over the world. Globally people are switching from fuel to electric vehicles including electric motorcycles but it is slow to happen in Sri Lanka.
He said that it was to breach this gap in Sri Lanka that Eco Trans Lanka Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd., under the trade mark of ELECTRA Electric Bikes has imported and marketed various types of electric motorcycles to Sri Lanka that can be used specially for town running.
E-Bikes were introduced to the roads to help out the people commute more economically. When it comes to fuel costs, petroleum based motorbikes costs much more per kilometer than an electric bike which only costs just a mere 0.50 cents per km. Electric Scooty types also have no noise, no vibrations, no smoke and no heat; making it very eco-friendly and cost effective option that also helps you contribute towards the protection of the environment. Furthermore, maintenance costs for E bikes are at a minimum.
We import e-bikes from China and marketed from our show room in Pelawatte Junction in Battaramulla. Eco Trans also imports tricycles of various models, bikes for disabled , delivery bikes, Electra Go Go Light weight range E Bikes with 40-60 km range Lithium Batteries.
He said that with the high global fuel prices the demand and requirement of electric scooters and motorbikes are now increasing.
He however said that people are still on two minds whether to switch to electric bikes due to several importers of Eclectic bikes shutting down their operations leaving the customer on cross roads without an agent to obtain spears and after sales services.
However, Eco Trans Lanka Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd which commenced its business in 2017 has made unhindered progress and the main reasons for this are the superior quality of the bikes that are imported, the flawless and prompt after sales services and the good word of satisfied customers that send new clients to the company.
The Company says despite the sluggish pace in growth in the e-motorbike segment in Sri Lanka, currently at around 2%, will see a gradual and rapid growth in the years to come. Slow but steadily the e-bike segment will grow and overtake the fuel powered two wheelers in Sri Lanka making it the preferred mode of transportation in the island very soon.
These electric powered models do not compromise on performance, with speeds ranging from a maximum of 40 kmph to 60 kmph and it also covers distances between 50 to 100 km, per charge.
The Electric Bikes manufactures uses high quality material and uses high grade main frame and other parts that are long lasting.
The e-bikes at Eco Trans are powered by Lithium and Lead Acid Batteries with test results showing a more powerful thrust than the normal average one. The changed front shape also provides more space for the Riders legs, which will help reduce leg injuries in crashes.
One of the major advantages of the e-bike is that it is emission- free, which would help achieve climate change-related emission targets.
Fernando said that he had a passion to do something unique for the country when he saw foreign exchange bleeding to import fuel based vehicles and then for heavy toll of spare parts and also the environmental pollution and had decided to find a solution for the burning issue. This is how I moved to the import of E bikes, he said.

Eshan Pieris ended the racing year by winning the 6th and final race of the Rotax Max Challenge Asia held last weekend at the Elite Speedway Circuit in Malaysia.
The last final of the Rotax Max Challenge Asia began under overcast conditions and by lap 3 there was a heavy drizzle but the DD2 drivers continued in their dry tyres. Eshan then demonstrated his wet driving capabilities as he pulled away from Senna Sulaiman Noor and the pursuing pack. By lap 13, the slippery conditions had become too dangerous and at the 16th lap the officials brought the race to an end with Eshan winning with a three second lead. This excellent performance contributed to Eshan being placed second overall in the 2018 Rotax Max Challenge Asia (DD2 Senior) which won him a seat to represent Asia in the Rotax Championship World Finals in Brazil at the end of November.
The year also saw Eshan placed 1st in the 2018 Rotax Invitation Race in Sepang (DD2 Senior). He also ended the season as overall second in the 2018 X30 South East Asia (Super Shifter).

Root becomes Heraths 100th Test victim at Galle
Foakes anchors England  on debut with 87 not out
GALLE, Tuesday: England had to again depend on their lower order batsmen to rescue them from total disaster after they lost half the side for 103 before recovering to make a decent 321 for eight wickets by the close on the opening day of the first cricket Test against Sri Lanka at the Galle International Cricket Stadium yesterday.
It was Englands lower order batters who actually won the five-match Test series 3-1 for them against India prior to the current series and it was no difference yesterday.
Their numbers 6, 7, 8 and 9 contributed 203 runs towards the total with debutant Ben Foakes playing the lead role with an undefeated 87 off 184 balls inclusive of six fours. It was a well disciplined risk-free knock that saw him stitch together three half century partnerships with Jos Buttler (38), Sam Curran (48) and Adil Rashid (35).
Foakes in fact was not even in the radar to make it to the final eleven until Monday when he was preferred to Jos Buttler. Buttler was the one spoken of highly to take over the gloves after regular wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow was ruled out of the series with a twisted ankle playing a game of football.
However it turned out to be a good choice by England for Foakes made full use of his opportunity to make his mark at the highest level.
A combination of poor shot selection and tight bowling by Sri Lanka saw Englands batting flounder after they had won the toss and chose to bat first. Both captains said that they would prefer to bat first not wanting to take a chance batting last on the Galle pitch. But the ball hardly did anything alarming and the surface turned out to be a slow turner.
Rain was predicted for the day but surprisingly kept away to allow a full days play although the sun hardly shone. With overcast skies and the English supporters outnumbering the locals the ground resembled more of an English Test venue rather than a Sri Lankan.
Apart from Englands late order recovery that was led by Foakes the highlight of the day was veteran spinner Rangana Herath claiming his 100th Test wicket at Galle and off-spinner Dilruwan Perera capturing four of the eight wickets to fall for the day.
Herath who is retiring from international cricket at the end of the Test was given a guard of honour by schoolboys when he took the field. He didnt have to wait too long to capture his 100th Test wicket at this venue.
In his third over England captain Joe Root danced down the track to him and yorked himself for 35 to provide him with that rare milestone. Muthiah Muralitharan is the only other bowler to take 100 Test wickets or more at Galle.
People may criticise Root for his recklessness when things were going well for England but on the other hand if not for his positive intent where he helped Keaton Jennings add 62 off 81 balls following the loss of two early wickets England would have been in deep trouble. Suranga Lakmal apparently getting the nod following Lahiru Kumaras ouster from the Test squad on disciplinary grounds gave Sri Lanka the breakthrough as early as the third over by sending back debutant Rory Burns (9) caught down the leg side and Moeen Ali for a golden duck with his off stump sent cartwheeling to have them two down for 10.
Following the Jennings-Root partnership that took the score to 72, Herath provided the important breakthrough with Roots wicket after which Dilruwan Perera took centre stage to send back Jennings for 46 scored off 53 balls (7 fours) and Ben Stokes for 7.
Buttler joined by Foakes put together an important stand of 61 for the sixth wicket before Perera picked up his third wicket of the innings by having Buttler caught behind for 38.
Englands lower order continued to prosper as Sam Curran  one of the heroes of Englands series win over India, continued to frustrate the Lankan bowlers. With Foakes who was holding up one end solidly with a maiden fifty off 111 balls, Curran added a valuable 88 runs for the seventh wicket.
Curran became the second England batsman to miss out on a fifty when he edged a delivery from Akila Dananjaya to Chandimal at slip with his score on 48. He thumped three sixes and a four in his 104-ball knock.
Dananjaya was Sri Lankas most expensive bowler conceding 78 runs off 18 overs before picking up his first wicket.
Shortly before the close Perera took his fourth wicket of the innings when Adil Rashids belligerent innings of 35 off 38 balls (2 sixes, 4 fours) was ended when he edged a catch to Chandimal at slip.
Foakes and Jack Leach (14 n.o.) saw England to the close without any further loss.
Sri Lanka will rue two missed opportunities the most vital of them being Kusal Mendis dropping Foakes at 60 at short leg off Perera. The other chance put down was by Angelo Mathews at slip when Jennings edged one off Dananjaya with his score on 26.
CHANDIMAL GROIN STRAIN
A worry for Sri Lanka was the frequent visits to the dressing room by skipper Chandimal who pulled a groin muscle while fielding and went off the field in the afternoon session. He returned after the tea break only to return once again after catching out Curran.
An SLC media release states: Skipper Dinesh Chandimal suffered a groin strain during the first day of the ongoing first test match played between Sri Lanka and England at the Galle Cricket Stadium. He is currently under observation and is not yet ruled out of the game.
England capped Surrey players Burns and Foakes who had played with former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara during his three-year stint with the county. Sri Lanka recalled opener Kaushal Silva for his first Test in 13 months. Both sides included three spinners.

The George Keyt inspiration
Fifty eight paintings if I counted right at the SRI LANKA ART 2018 at the J.D.A. Perera Gallery presented by the George Keyt Foundation and sponsored by Nations Trust Bank was a great feast for the eyes that were done in a multitude of watercolour, Chinese Ink, Acrylics, Oil on canvas, line drawing, Pastels etc. You name it, they were there; splashing landscapes, portraiture, nudes, and many subjects on artistic preference. They varied in compositions, light-effects, and subject matter with graceful women taking priority.
The exhibits hanging proudly on the walls made it obvious that Sri Lanka was bounteous in her enormous artistic ability and that we lacked nothing short of the living masters in other parts of the world. The sensitivity, emotional-beauty and dignity come easily to our painters whether young or old: novice or the experienced that is inherent and inculcated in their genes.
Aspiring artists
A collective group of artists were given the opportunity to showcase their artistic talents by the George Keyt Foundation and drew a large number of art lovers and aspiring artists.
Their skills varied and so did their medium to place their visuals on palates in a combination of colour mixing from sombre to arabesque fury.
There were many that caught drew my attention in spite all artworks being excellent or litter short of it. Sadly I found nothing or very little George Keyt influence in their art.
Face to face with a slight resemblance to a famous mural done by Ludolf Cackhuysen called The Storm At Sea was Nihal Sangabo Dias's BOAT; oil on canvas stretching to 99 x 122 cm.
The storm has settled for Dias to radiate on his blue/green combination to surface the calm after a storm.
There is life in the painting as the fishermen struggle which is a magnificent subject for an artist.
I thought Sampath Amunugama from St. Thomas College was unique in his untitled painting using Acrylic Charcoal on paper. Very cheap material for a classic and to experiment upon.
So were the figure studies of Michael Anthonisz confining himself to Chinese Ink Wash on Rice Paper and secondly Pen and Ink and Watercolour on Paper.
Both artists displayed the ability to break away from traditional colour combinations.
Eye contact
The most outstanding painting of the lot because of its mesmerizing authenticity in creating our heritage on eye contact and taking us back to our civilization in a matter of seconds.
Pride of history found between the lines and simply done in Ink on Paper to stretch at 21 x 30cm was disappointing to me because the painting should have been at least 104 x 97cm. Artist Gamini Abeykoon missed a point there when he had the opportunity to sizzle. Nevertheless, here is a painter who can reveal our proud civilization on eye contact.
The Girl And The Cow, oil on canvas, 65 x 65. Sujatha Wanamali Malalnayake has come up with a close-up painting on her chosen subject, depicting the girl's love for the cow the way she holds on tenderly, leaning against the animal.
Apparently, she has milked the cow as shown in the pitcher she is carrying.
It is a typical story of a village lass in our rural.
Her hands are inappropriate if one were to judge her long fingers. However, the cow compensates for the little miss with its loving eyes responding to the girl's touch.

A total of 14,000 MBBS doctors (90 percent of doctors in the public service) have signed a petition against the former Health Minister and expressed their objection towards re-appointing him even as a Cabinet Minister, the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said.
He was addressing the media in Colombo yesterday.
He said the rest of the doctors are now allowed to place their signature in this petition via internet because they serve in distant and difficult areas in the country and are unable to travel to Colombo due to their official duties.
There are about 20,000 members in the GMOA which is in existence since 1926. The petition will be handed over to the President and the Prime Minister soon, he said. According to Dr. Ananda, the former Health Minister had launched a plan to join the new government and grab the Health Ministry again.
The new government should get rid of all henchmen who are officials of the former Health Minister to implement new policies. Otherwise they will sabotage the work, he said.
The officials of the former Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama such as Chandani Wijewardana, K. G. Weerasinghe, Mangala Yapa, Desha De Mel and New Zealand citizen Ravi Ratnayake etc should be removed with immediate effect to implement the new government's projects without hindrance, he added.

Over thirty children participated had a dialogue with the story teller, sang some folk poems and recited folk tales they knew.
Parents and teachers who participated at the book launch in appreciation said the event that focused on children meant a lot. They viewed it was a rare opportunity for their children as well as for them.
Piyasena Wickramage recalls with contentment his association with the literary greats, Martin Wickramasinghe, Prof Sarachchandra and Prof Senarath Paranavithana.
He has first met the book trade pioneer and Sarasavi Bookshop chief H D Premasiri, in 1970 to build a longstanding friendship.
A writing career spanning over 45 years with a gamut of books to his credit had induced maturity into Wickramages literary works and he is now more eager than ever to share with the society the knowledge in his kitty.
Purple Planet in Sinhala
To coincide with Wickramages book launch, Sinhala translation of veteran author Bhadraji Mahinda Jayatilakas 2009 state literary award winning childrens story, Purple Planet (Dura Etha Dam Polova) by Amritha Wickramage was launched at the same venue.
Amritha who works as a scientist in New Zealand is Wickramages daughter. This is her fourth Sinhala Translation of childrens books.

Imbibed in confidence
Educated to inspire, and inspire others to find the power to create change, is what Hejaaz International has accomplished in Head Girl of Hejaaz International Dehiwala Salma Firoze and Head Boy of Hejaaz International Mount Lavinia Arshaq Ibrahim. Perfect Prefect features these two head prefects who lead by example.
Salma Firoze is grateful to her parents for selecting Hejaaz International as her educational institute, calling it her second home, and thanks her principal, teachers and friends for moulding her into the confident young lady she is.
Full potential
I believe that a role model is someone who would make a young person aspire to develop a character that is optimistic with integrity, compassion and determination. A role model should be someone who will enable a young person to realize his or her full potential, said Firoze.
Hejaaz is an institute that provides a holistic education not only confined to academics but provides a learning environment so that the child takes part in sports and creative work with debates and quizzes that stimulate the mind.
All this helps in building a childs personality making the child a balanced individual. My school has imbibed in me the qualities such as integrity and confidence and I am proud to go out into the world as a student of Hejaaz, stated Firoze.
She points out that the course of history can be changed in a powerful way if both men and women join together. Men and women united can change the world. Male and female leaders are both necessary to change the world we live in. That is the force that can change the times we live in. Maybe even permanently.
Admirable characteristics
I admire the former first lady of USA Michelle Obama. I find her really inspiring because she speaks very eloquently and along with inner strength she has admirable characteristics. She is an advocate of women's rights and she was an exemplary first lady. I think as women we need to let the world know that women can learn and come up in life and be independent and I would like to influence other women to challenge themselves. I also feel that Sri Lankan society can become a more progressive community if our girls achieve their full potential, explained Firoze.
Firoze believes in working for the betterment of our nation and wants to be an advocate for human rights and make a difference in the lives of all those people who are deprived of their human rights. She feels very strongly about child labour and wants to do her part to abolish child labour in the world. This is because she has received much from life and wants to give back. Make a difference in a childs life, so that child can go to school and have an education. So the child can have a future.
I would like to tell everyone to aspire to inspire. Be a person who will also help others succeed in life and celebrate people. Even a small compliment can bring a change in other peoples lives. Stay focused and be optimistic and be confident, never lose hope and never be arrogant. The key to happiness in life is when you are with people who really understand you, added Firoze.
Courage and strength
Obstacles and difficulties come in many forms. Some take years to resolve. Some take a very short time to resolve. What is clear is that you need the courage and strength to face it.
I feel that when encountering an obstacle you should know exactly what you are dealing with. A good understanding of the obstacle will help you. When you know what you are dealing with, you can get ideas from those closest to you as to how you should deal with it. I usually talk to my mother because she has more experience than me and she knows me better than anybody else. When you have the solution then you should find the courage within you to implement the solution, pointed out Firoze.
Head Boy Arshaq Ibrahim has also been educated to inspire. Like Firoze he too has been blessed. Through the education he has received, he is a confident young man who wants to make an impact on society.
Basically a role model is someone who should inspire people. There are people in this world who inspire others by the success they have enjoyed. That is the kind of role model a young person needs. I have different role models based on different aspects. I am someone who believes in human rights so I choose Malala Yousafzai as my role model. But personally, I feel my father is my role model. My father is a very simple and humble man. That impresses me. So it depends on peoples ideas, said Ibrahim.
Obstacles come in two kinds explains Ibrahim. Some obstacles come from within -Sometimes you may lack skills that can obstruct you from accomplishing your goals. But there are other obstacles that come externally. Some people may not like you. Certain incidents can also be obstacles when it comes to achieving your goals he points out.
Endless ruminating
So when I face obstacles I try and understand  is it external or internal Is it rational for me to stress out about the problem Some obstacles come to you and it just disappears on its own. Sometimes endless ruminating is pointless. But there are times when I talk to my best friend as well. I need opinions from others. I even talk to my parents who have a lot of experience. I analyze the problem and think for myself. Obstacles make me strong. Obstacles make all of us strong, points out Ibrahim.
As a youngster, he was extremely introverted. In 2016 October he was selected as President of the Model United Nations. That was when he got responsibilities. Many people depended on him. That was when his success story started. That was when he had to work towards a goal. He had to come out of his shell.
When I was introverted I did not move around with others and did not even speak to the teacher. My mother, however, encouraged me saying that introverts succeed in life and achieve things in life because they talk less and do more work. Those words motivated me. As President of MUN, I had to organize many events. Being the junior prefect I had to help my senior prefects. After becoming Head Prefect I had more responsibilities and had to organize so many things. So my school had made me into a person who can face obstacles and overcome challenges.
I was a student who did not study much and I used to get very moderate grades. In Grade Seven, my class teacher actually motivated me in such a way that I felt that I could accomplish what I set my mind to. My school has moulded me into the kind of citizen who can take up leadership and responsibilities. If you are a leader there will always be people who oppose you. The management of Hejaaz has stood by me and encouraged me and supported me, explained Ibrahim.
Need to discuss
He has three goals. He is interested in aviation and would like to be an aerospace engineer. He also has a calling to be a human rights activist in the United Nations. He correctly points out that he feels a need to discuss issues that children of his age are facing in other parts of the world. This is due to his experience in the MUN. Lastly, he wants to be an Entrepreneur because he wants to give back to society. Ibrahim says that leadership can be used in a positive and negative way. You can misuse your power or you can use it for the betterment of humanity.
Ibrahim feels that there are common myths in society among the youth that should be abolished. He points out that one myth is that you need to drink cigarettes and live the life of a playboy to gain acceptance. On social media, if there is a picture of someone drinking a cigarette that post gets more likes than a normal picture, says Ibrahim.
I enjoy a good life in Sri Lanka but in other parts of the world we see suffering  the War in Syria. The bloodshed and innocent people are being killed. We have had problems even in Sri Lanka. We may have differences but that should not separate us. Social and religious discrimination and gender inequality concern me. These are problems we have to solve without being selfish, explains Ibrahim.
His message to the youth is to achieve something in life you need to work hard. Life is tough and achieving something is not easy. People will try and discourage you. But these are the people who fear you will one day achieve your goals. That is the main reason they demotivate you. A leader works with his teammates humbly and does not demand respect. Just because you may not be recognized do not think you are not a good leader. Make sure you stay humble. Every time you fall you have to stand up explains Ibrahim.

Indulgence in healthy energy
If you walk or make a visit to the cities of the Western Province /or places close to your abodes or residences, you will see massive name boards displaying one specific word or eye-catching term SPA in big, bold letters in a very competitive and crisscross fashion.
It is very attracting and at the same time, inviting the general public to experience at least for once the SPA -Ayurvedic treatment, a body massage to keep oneself fit.
Although down the ages, there had been a number of traditional ways and means of keeping oneself physically fit, now in the technically advanced world, despite the advancement of science and technology, there is a tendency to go down the memory lane of yesteryear searching the past, the age-old systems of keeping human body and mind healthy.
Researchers in this vital field of healthy living, leave no stone unturned and make all efforts to surface to get the best of those systems, buried with the passage of time and mix them, with the modern trends and make the massage centres popular around the world.
A word about Sri-Lankan Ayurvedic resorts before the now famous Spas come into operation will not be out of place.
The Sri Lankan Ayurvedic resorts for decades remain among the best in the world. The westerners are very much attracted to them, due to its more holistic approach in place of conventional medicine.
Sri Lanka Ayurvedic resorts are centres of healing as they are based on the Ayurvedic principle of balance body, mind and soul.
Ayurveda, one of the world's oldest forms of healing, and its origin in India go back to ages well over 3,000 years or more. The Sinhalese kings lost no time in embracing and pioneered in establishing Ayurveda Treatment Centres in the ancient cities of the kingdoms like Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa they ruled.
Sri Lankans who run Spas of the day, in the towns and the cities, a money-spinning, lucrative business, could run the centres with their heads held high with just pride being intact with their roots, and by introducing some of the indigenous treating methods as a novelty to the body massage.
The local SPA centres, it is said, should stress on the importance of following the Ayurvedic process, methodically to fit in with the Asian climatic conditions, akin to Sri Lanka.
Gazing at the word or the term SPA, when I saw it first, with the troubled mind I was trying to pronounce it and understand the meaning it conveys.
My inquisitive mind was not at rest until I found what stands behind the word or term SPA.
The word SPA comes from the name given to the Belgium town Spa.
The town SPA claims to be famous for its range of mineral water exports worldwide and is the cynosure being very closely knit to the world-renowned Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps which hosts the world acclaimed Belgian Grand Prix (an automobile race) annual.
It was here in Spa, the very first world beauty pageant Concours de Beaute was held on September 19, 1888, and it hosted the stage two, of the year 2010 Tour de France on July 5th of that year.
Perusing the notes I have collected during the past few decades on matters related to Western and Eastern Philosophy as a student of Philosophy, and keenly interested in knowing the role Ayurveda play in promoting Eastern and Asian medicine and health patterns during the times of Maha Bharatha or Greater India, I came across phrase in Latina Lingua for term SPA bringing solace to my worrying mind.
While you keep guessing what the meaning of SPA is in Latin, I want to say that by browsing the internet, I learnt that SPA, which now seems to be very popular here, is the name for one of the towns found in Belgium from the times of Romans.
Thus the SPA, which is very popular among locals (although they may not know why Sri Lankans call massage centres SPA) originates, makes reference to a Belgium town, a healing site of fame, the cold spring, frequented by many, as a watering-place as early as the 14th century.
The SPA, the Municipality of Liege Province in Belgium is situated within a valley, in the Ardennes mountains 22 miles or 35 kilometres to the Southeast of Liege and 28 miles or 45 kilometres to the Southwest of Aachen.
SPA, the oldest, iron and steel centre created around the year 1335 in Belgium, within the border of the Province of Liege, is one of the main tourist cities of fame. This was owing to the fact, of water found here was of very high therapeutic value with medicinal properties and the Romans knew about it.
This spring called espa, in Walloon, a word for fountain, dialect spoken by the people in Wallonia in South Belgium.
This location where the natural mineral waters with curative power springs is an attracting site for tourists. Hence it is called Aquae Spadaanae and the term SPA indicates the availability of mineral water necessary for body massage.
It is on record that the Greeks were responsible for introducing and in opening bathing regimens, which laid the foundation for, now world famous Spa process and procedures.
Human society from the prehistoric times, or from the times of its origin had a strong belief that spring water has curative powers for ailments from which humans suffer.
Based on this belief there are SPA towns and SPA resorts including hot spring resorts, run offering typical heath treatment varieties and there one special treatment, and it is known as balneotherapy.
It is a therapeutic use of bathing agents such as mineral and thermal waters, mud and gases.
It is very popular across the globe but in a very special way it has caught the minds of the polity living both in Europe and Japan.
These centres provide quite a popular Day Spas variety, ensuring personal care treatment.
The term or the word SPA, taken in itself means fountain and also means to gush forth.
Some are of the view that the word Spa comes from Latin spagere means to scatter, sprinkle and fountain.
The SPA, our readers by now are very familiar with, said to stands for good Health Through Water.
Some claim that the SPA is an acronym (a word formed using the first letters of various words) of Latin phases like Salus Per Aquam ( as used by Dr Jeffrey Rosenberg). Translated that into English it means health through water.
Spas Research Fellowship uses the term sanitas per aquas- health through water. The British Spas Federation says senare per aqua.
Of course, there is no historical background to this lengthy Latin phase and some holds the view that this Latin phrase came into use in the 20th century.
Whatever it is, one must on guard, and be careful in entering the SPA whether they are Ayurvedic or not, as the tendency is there to turn massage centres into brothel houses by brushing the vital body parts for immoral acts.
The searching eye of the lawmakers and the police are around the corner to arrest those brothel houses run under the SPA screen.

The camp administered free medical checkups, including diagnoses of medical deficiencies and complications as well as respective treatments.

Leisure industry upbeat that Govt would  fizzle out adverse travel advisories
Sri Lankan leisure industry is upbeat that the new government would be able to fizzle out adverse travel advisories that were imposed against Sri Lanka by foreign missions in the wake of President Maithripala Sirisena appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister.
The worlds second largest travel show WTM, is currently in progress in London and new Tourism Minister Wasantha Senanayake attended the opening ceremony on Monday. He also addressed the foreign media and Sri Lankan participants at the event. The new Sri Lankan Tourism Brand identity, So Sri Lanka too was launched at this event. The New Minister also told the foreign media that there was no violence as projected by some of the travel advisories and explained about the current political situation to them.
Veteran British politician and former Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, Lord Naseby who attended the opening ceremony of the Sri Lanka stand said that there truly is nothing quite like Sri Lanka. I think Sri Lanka in its very composition  geographically compact, naturally diverse, culturally dynamic and contemporary in its outlook  is very clever and enticing for any type of British traveler.
So Sri Lanka is intriguing and impactful, and for a country competing with the best destinations across the globe  this interpretation of the magic of the island Ive visited countless times and loved more with each experience  is fresh, memorable and universal in its sentiment.
The launch of So Sri Lanka at the World Travel Market (WTM) in London is a testament to the importance of the UK tourism market to our island. As the third-largest contributor to Sri Lankas tourism industry, with significant year-on-year growth, I am particularly pleased that the beginning of this momentous journey starts here, said Manisha Gunesekera, High Commissioner for Sri Lanka in the United Kingdom.
 It is also important mentioning that this is the first time in history that Sri Lanka tourism has worked towards building a strategic digital-first perspective, So Sri Lanka is an amplifier brand that supports and engages typical millennial travel exploration, this is important in view of the statistic that in 2020, 50% of travel revenue will be spent by millennials, and Asia is a millennial favorite  so we are committed to making Sri Lanka future-savvy and a vibrantly relevant destination going forward, Minister Senanayake said.

He said anyone can petition to the Supreme Court and inquire the legality of the Presidents decisions.

## Title: MANAGEMENT OF NATIONAL MONEY: NEED FOR NEW TECHNIQUES

## Date: Wednesday, November 7, 2018 - 01:00
MANAGEMENT OF NATIONAL MONEY: NEED FOR NEW TECHNIQUES
My article published in Daily News Economic Insights on November 1, 2018 covered how banks manage credit in banking business. Credit is the source of creation of national money. Bank credit is only the middle layer of credit/national money pyramid. The bottom is the credit/money printed by the Central Bank (CB). The upper pyramid contains diverse credit markets, both organised and informal. Financial crises that erupt from time to time are the cracks of the pyramid at systemically important points, i.e., some banks or credit markets or both.
How Credit Creates Money
Money in the economy is created by risky, pyramidal business of credit. The CB is the guardian of the credit pyramid through the legal tender/currency on behalf of the government. Each currency note in the pyramid is a liability of or credit to the government. Consider following transactions.
* The CB lends Rs. 100 to the government and stops any further money printing.
* The government takes currency and spends.
* Public receive currency (Rs. 100) as income.
* The general banking habit of public is that they keep a small portion of income as currency and the balance in deposits at banks for transactions. If the publics currency holding is 10% of income, Rs. 90 is deposited at banks.
* Bank business is the lending out of deposits after keeping a portion of deposits as reserves with the CB (statutory reserves, 7.5% at present) and at hand (e.g., 3.6% for internal payments). Therefore, banks deposit Rs. 6.75 at the CB, retain Rs. 3.25 at hand and lend the balance Rs. 80.
* Bank borrowers (households, companies, investors and government) spend the proceeds of bank loans.
* The money so spent is received again by public as their income. They keep 10% as currency and deposit the balance Rs. 72. Therefore, Rs. 72 out of Rs. 80 loans have become new deposits.
* The national money at this stage is Rs. 262 (i.e., Rs. 100 in currency and Rs. 162 in deposits), i.e. Rs. 100 printed and Rs. 162 created.
* The same process continues on new deposits of Rs. 72 also several rounds between lending and deposits.
This creation will stop when total Rs. 100 of currency is completely absorbed into currency holdings of the public and reserves of banks as no further credit can be granted by banks due to non-availability of currency reserves to be kept for new deposits. The time taken/speed to finish the process depends on banking habits. If banks reduce reserves, they can further expand credit and deposits. At the end, the public will hold more money than money printed by the CB due to creation of money.
The public does not stop at banks. They deposit, invest and borrow from non-bank financial institutions and credit markets. Therefore, this layer also creates credit and money. The total national money that serves the economy is the sum of all credit in the pyramid. Therefore, the national money is nothing but national credit. However, for policy purpose, we count national money created at the banking layer only (i.e., bank money). See graphic and table
National Bank Money
The CB is the printing layer for grant of credit to and purchase of foreign exchange from banks and government. The purchase of foreign exchange is also credit as the CB has to sell it back when demanded for foreign payments. The CB buys foreign exchange without letting the currency to appreciate in the market. When same foreign exchange is demanded later, it is not proper for the CB to suddenly decline it and let the market to determine the currency value. Banks grant credit depending on the publics banking habits and demand for credit by various sectors of the economy for consumption and investments determined by the macroeconomic momentum and expectations.
Nobody can have a correct economic model or divine wisdom to determine the volume of national money required or desirable to fuel a level of the macroeconomy, as measured by the growth or employment or general price level or any other variables, desirable for the public. If something is produced too much than needed, its price will plummet causing bankruptcies. The same applies for national money too. Therefore, the control of national money stock is a need-based judgement to keep the economy going without confronting bankruptcies.
Managing National Money
The national money also is a product that has a value/price determined by demand and supply. This value has two components. First is the recovery value of underlying credit which depends on credit risk. The second is the purchasing value or what credit/money can buy which depends on inflation risk. The price actually charged is the interest rate on credit to cover both risks. The higher the risk, the higher is the interest rate. Therefore, national money management involves in managing the volume of money/credit at a reasonable degree of two risks.
* Credit Risk
Deposits perform as money only if borrowers repay underlying credit. The credit or default risk varies across banks. The CB also does not have means to redeem all paper currency and foreign exchange. The excessive currency depreciation is partly about poor repayment of foreign exchange. The general public confidence keeps the credit pyramid performing as the public rarely demand their money in herd. The prudential regulation largely keeps the confidence and banks safe and sound, but never guaranteed. Therefore, the public also need to be patient and prudent in managing their money to control underlying credit risk within their appetite. Unmanaged credit risk cracks the credit/money pyramid. Runs to banks in herds serve no purpose other than bankruptcy to all.
* Inflation Risk
Inflation risk occurs when prices in general in the economy are to rise. The domestic value of money and international value of money are the two concepts that separate the inflation risk between domestically produced goods and services and imports. In modern economies, no pure domestic inflation can be calculated due to international trade and global value chains. Therefore, inflation is a risk combined of both domestic and foreign factors. The recent excessive currency depreciation is a good experience how unmanaged national money gets eroded in value due to inflation risk. Unmanaged inflation is a risk to living standards of fixed income earners being the majority public. Protracted deflation also is a risk as it causes economic recession, e.g., Japan, the US and Europe during the past decade.
As such, national money management is part and parcel of the national economy management as the money fuels the economy. The CB is the authority for policies to manage both risks of national money in Sri Lanka. Prudential regulation and monetary policy are the mutually supportive mandates. The Monetary Law Act has provided a wide framework for the past 67 years to manage both national money and national economy. Therefore, risks to national money and economy can be exacerbated by the failure of the CB too.
A Way Forward for New Techniques
We need to review whether our credit pyramid is effective to minimize risks and promote the quantum of macroeconomy desirable. All advanced economies have got to this stage by managing the wider credit pyramid to cater to various sectors of the economy irrespective of the scales.
Sri Lanka also had an active credit delivery policy through the banking system until early 2000s. The policy had specific focus on sectors of the economy based on setting up of development credit institutions, the CB refinance, foreign credit funds and bank credit for rural agriculture, small and medium industries, self-employment, export industries, rural housing, etc.
1) Monetary Law Act (MLA)-CB/Monetary Board (MB) as the National Money/Credit Manager
* Section 5
Securing the objectives of economic and price stability and financial system stability, with a view to encouraging and promoting the developments of productive resources in Sri Lanka as the authority responsible for the administration, supervision and regulation of the monetary, financial and payments system of Sri Lanka by actions authorized in the MLA.
* Section 63
i) Regulate the supply, availability and cost of money as to secure, so far as possible for above objectives, having regard to the monetary needs of particular sectors of the economy as well as of the economy as a whole.
ii) Determine domestic monetary policies especially by considering their effects on Sri Lankas international financial position as evidenced by the relation of domestic to world prices and costs, by the level and composition of exports and imports, by the international balance of payments, and, ultimately, by the ability of the Central Bank to maintain the international stability of the Sri Lanka rupee and its free convertibility for current international transactions.
* Section 65
Determine the international monetary policy to maintain the par value of the Sri Lanka rupee or exchange arrangements as are consistent with the underlying trends in the country and so relate its exchange with other currencies as to assure its free use for current international transactions.
* Section 101(1)(b)
Fixing the maximum percentage of loans to be extended to any identified sector of the economy by commercial banks or specialized banks.
* Sections 30
Actions in respect of a bank insolvent or likely to become unable to meet demands of its depositors or that its continuance in business is likely to involve loss to depositors and creditors.
There is a large number of policy actions permitted to the MB/CB for above duties.
2) Solution to Problems
Despite above mandates, significant problems in the volume and distribution of national money across sectors continue. The depreciating currency is a fine eye-witness for huge loss to publics funds due to sudden CB decision without pre-research to let the market mechanism to determine the exchange rate without due regard to requirements of the MLA. Everybody knows the difficulty in getting credit to micro and SME sector. Modern private credit channels remain suppressed due to stringent definition of deposits and unfriendly regulations which make almost all investment trusts unauthorized deposit-takers.
The monetary policy remains inappropriate for an active credit/money pyramid. First, the policy is unreasonably focused on flexible inflation targets monitored from the weather and subsidy/administrative prices-driven cost of living index. Second, the overnight inter-bank interest rate target-based bank liquidity management is adopted to transmit the monetary policy to the wider credit pyramid without any assessment of sectoral credit needs. The CB does not have empirical research on success of its policies to manage national money and economy within the MLA. Even the US Fed has credit and regulatory policies to promote wider credit delivery to address sectoral credit needs.
The current monetary policy model is a result of the CB modernized for a lean central bank in early 2000s as recommended by the IMF/World Bank in western versions although the CB was the central bank of Sri Lanka. Western central banks have changed their monetary policy version to aid recovery from the global financial crisis 2007/09. When the initially modernized monetary policy framework was submitted to former Governor A. S. Jayawardena in December 2000, he commented this sounds like changing the pillow for headache!.
The CBs modernization eorked only for a lean monetary policy by abandoning active credit channels while all concerned agency functions continued with huge conflicts of interests and irregularities. Therefore, we need to reactivate the full potential of the Sri Lankan monetary policy to serve for all economic sectors in compliance with the MLA. Without innovating the pyramids core, the government cannot promote it with ad-hoc credit schemes through state banks.
Therefore, we need to have a strong policy discussion. The CBs young economists who have interests in the country need to rethink and start economic research to assess sectoral credit and economic needs (under section 25 of the MLA) and implement monetary and regulatory policies to promote a credit pyramid that can serve the majority public while preserving its stability. There are ample success stories from the world. Those are not rocket-sciences, but ways of doing things for the benefit of wider public. Otherwise, the present economic management model of gambling on children would be catastrophic.

Manusha naive to resign based on Speakers statement - MP
The President has acted in compliance with the Constitution and he has exclusive authority to prorogue parliament, former Minister and Kurunegala district MP Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said.
Yapa said that Galle district MP Manusha Nanayakkara seems to have forgotten about presidential powers on proroguing parliament, when he was sworn in as Deputy Labour and Foreign Employment Minister.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena appointed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister and the entire country endorsed this appointment.
The Labour and Foreign Employment Deputy Minister has resigned from his post yesterday citing prorogation of parliament as unconstitutional, illegal and unconventional.
Nanayakkara said he tendered his resignation based on statement made by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who decided to accepted the status that existed previously.
As the majority is of the opinion that all changes made in parliament are undemocratic and inconsistent with traditions of parliament and as the majority of parliament have requested that the status that existed before these changes were made shall be accepted, I emphasise that I am compelled to accept the status that existed previously until such time that they and the new political alliance prove their majority in parliament
MP Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said Manusha Nanayakkaras decision to resign from the post of Deputy Minister based on the Speakers statement demonstrateS that he does not have any understanding on the Constitution.
He added that he will not approve the Nanayakkaras statement adding that Speaker has powers only to continue the parliament sitting after parliament is reconvened by the President in accordance with the parliamentary traditions.

MAS, Bank Indonesia set up US$10 bn bilateral financial arrangement
The central banks of Singapore and Indonesia on Monday (Nov 5) signed agreements to set up a US$10 billion (S$13.8 billion) bilateral financial arrangement.
It will enable the two sides to access foreign currency liquidity from each other, if needed, to preserve monetary and financial stability, said the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Bank Indonesia in a joint media release.
The bilateral financial arrangement, which will be in place for a year, was first announced last month by Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during their Leaders Retreat. It comprises two agreements - a local currency bilateral swap agreement (LCBSA) that allows for the exchange of local currencies between the two central banks of up to US$7 billion; as well as an enhanced bilateral USD repurchase agreement of US$3 billion.
An LCBSA is a common form of bilateral financial cooperation between central banks. Through such an agreement, a central bank can obtain foreign currency from another central bank in exchange for domestic currency at the prevailing exchange rate, with the agreement to reverse the transaction at the same exchange rate on a specified maturity date.

Migrant caravan rests, regroups in Mexico City
MEXICO: A caravan of Central American migrants that has drawn frequent Twitter tirades from President Donald Trump ahead of the US midterm elections rested and regrouped Monday at a stadium-turned-shelter in Mexico City before pressing on.
With their sights set on reaching the United States, some 5,000 migrants, mainly from violence-plagued Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, are expected to converge on Mexico City in the coming days and then continue their northward trek, authorities said.
The first 470 arrived Sunday in Mexico City and spent the night at a stadium on the capitals east side, where authorities have set up a large camp to host them and provide food and water.
By Monday evening, some 4,000 people had arrived at the camp. Another 1,000 are expected to arrive by Wednesday, as the fragmented caravan regroups after dispersing across central and eastern Mexico, according to the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH).
Often traveling in families or with young children, the migrants are sleeping in tents, on the ground or on the cement bleachers of the stadium, in frigid nighttime temperatures of around 12 degrees Celsius (54 Fahrenheit) in the high altitude of Mexico City.
Many were nursing colds or mangled feet after a trek of more than 1,600 kilometers (some 1,000 miles) that began on October 13 in the city of San Pedro Sula, Honduras.
I couldnt sleep. I was cold and coughing all night, said Honduran Karla Membreno, 23, who is making the trek with her husband and sister-in-law. But we have to be strong. God gives us strength to carry on, she told AFP. Medical staff were attending to migrants and giving flu shots at impromptu clinics at the stadium.
Other migrants were busy digging through large piles of donated clothing looking for coats, gloves or anything to fend off the cold.
Two other large groups of Central Americans comprising between 3,000 and 4,000 migrants in all are currently making their way across the southern Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca, the CNDH said.
Another 3,230 Central Americans who were traveling by caravan have requested asylum in Mexico, according to the interior ministry.
Trump has made immigration a central issue ahead of Tuesdays key midterm vote, seen as a referendum on his presidency so far.
Calling the caravan a national emergency, he has threatened to deploy as many as 15,000 troops to the border with Mexico. Some 4,800 had been deployed as of Monday, the Pentagon said.
He has also asserted the caravan, which remains more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from the border, includes members of the violent street gang MS-13 and unknown Middle Easterners. The president of the United States sure threatens people a lot, said Eber Josue, a 25-year-old Honduran migrant.
It makes us laugh. Were not criminals. Were hard-working people. The CNDH said it had no evidence of criminals or people who could pose a security risk traveling in the caravan.
Some migrants, however, said they were aware of a small band of young gang members in the group.
About 75 percent of (the caravans members) are women, children, the elderly and other vulnerable people. The rest are mostly young men with their families. There are very few traveling alone, said Gustavo Rodriguez Zarate, head of migrant support programs for the Catholic archdiocese of Puebla.
He said the migrants were traveling together to protect themselves from the many risks on the journey. Mexican gangs regularly extort, kidnap or kill Central Americans trying to reach the United States.
Many of the migrants are fleeing poverty and insecurity in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala -- Central Americas so-called Northern Triangle -- where powerful street gangs rule their turf with brutal violence.
They are still not exactly sure what route they will take, when or how.
When the rest of the caravan gets here, well talk about what to do, said Teresa Estrada, a 23-year-old Guatemalan. - AFP

Most skips in 24 hours
A Japanese jump rope enthusiast broke a Guinness world record for most skips over a rope in 24 hours when he hit a total of 151,409 skips.
Hijiki Ikuyama, 36, who has previously broken numerous rope-skipping world records, alternated between using a larger rope held by assistants and using his own smaller rope when he spent 24 hours working to beat Isabel Bush's record of 151,036 skips.
"It was so tough I had to take 10-minute breaks every 20 minutes," Ikuyama said.
"The guidelines allowed me to skip a large rope spun by assistants so the plan was to alternate between a large rope and short rope. But for the long rope, we didn't practice together beforehand, and we couldn't synchronize properly so I kept on trapping the rope and losing time," he said.
"Eight hours before the end of the attempt, I ditched the large rope and skipped solo -- I thought I have to go and push the limit," Ikuyama said.
He finished with a total 151,409 skips, enough to take the record. Ikuyama said his interest in the sport began at a young age.
"I had a crush on my teacher, and I was thinking of ways to get some attention from her. Because she was pretty good at rope skipping, I thought mastering that would impress her," he said.

Nature of Hindu temple sculptures
Idol worship is an important aspect in Hinduism and it is generally divided into three main categories: Saivaism, Vaishnavaism and Sakthiism. Saivaism implies that Lord Siva is governor God of Hinduism. Vaishnavaism is devoted to Lord Vishnu (The god of protection) and his nine Avatars. Sakthism considers Lok Mata, Goddess Sakthi as the main God. According to Sri Lankan temple architecture, designs, inner structural views and interior structural decorations almost reflect the Hindu temple architecture and structure of the South Indian states especially the Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.
The inside and outside of Hindu temples are decorated with typical Dravidian sculptures. Sri Lankan temple sculptures are divided into different categories. Some are stone made sculptures. Temple statues of Sri Lanka are made out of a variety of metals. Among them, most of the worshipping statues or idols are made out of Iyempon - made out of amalgamated five different valuable varieties of metals. Besides these Iyempon statues or idols, a considerable number of granite and sandstone sculptures are also available all over the island.
Exclusive metals
At archaeological sites, a variety of excavated Hindu temple statutes were found. They are made out of different exclusive metals, including bronze, copper, silver and gold. Temple worshipping sculptures and statues, another category is inner decorative temple sculptures and statues and they often found at the temple walls, temple pillars, temple towers decorative, inner and outer rooftops.
The Hindu temples are famous for the tower sculptures or statues. They represent numerous beautiful human dance postures of Apsaras (dancers of heaven) and Yalies (imaginary species with extinct lion-faced reptiles). Most of them represent various stories from Hindu Puranas or Ithihasas. The temple chariots (temple Ther / Ratha) are also decorated with beautiful wooden sculptures. From the shape and sculptures of the Raja Gopuram and the Vimanams of the temple, one could easily recognize the main deity of the temple. For instance, majestic temple towers of the Siva temples are generally decorated with magnificent sculptures related to Siva epics (Purana or Ithihasa stories. The towers of Lord Murugan (Skanda) temples are decorated with the sculptures or statues that represent the episodes of Skanda Puranam. The towers of Sri Vaishnava temples represent the holy epics of Lord Mahavishnu. Goddess Sri Kali or Sri Durga temple towers exhibit various holy plays of the Lok Mata.
All the Sri Lankan Hindu temple sculptures and statues resemble South Indian or Dravidian architecture. Often the creativity of the local sculptors represents their creations with the modifications based on regional influences.
Temple sculptures
In the past, the temple sculptures were made by using the kaolin or clay material. Later granite stones were used for making the temple sculptures and statues. The granite stones have very high resistance provided by fine-grained molecules which can withstand very harsh weather conditions.
Hindu temples which are found in the Dravidian States exhibit beautiful sculptures that adorn the pillars; Mandapams (halls), Vimanams tower over the Garpagraham (Sanctorum) adorn with sculptures and the Raja Gopurams temple main entrance towers (decorated with beautiful sculptures). These temple tower sculptures depict different stories related to the main presiding deity of the temple.
Other castle kind of structures including Mani Gopurams (castles for the holy bells), permanent structures of the movable holy carts, roof of the temple cart shed, the pillars of the temples and Theerthak Kerni (Holy water pond of the temple) and other permanent structures of the Holy temple garden are decorated with beautiful sculptures or statues. Most of the sculptures or statues exhibit various postures of dance and physical conflicts. The structures can be seen at many historical sites in Sri Lanka.
Minute details
To study the historical background of Hinduism via a specified timescale that prevailed in Sri Lanka can be done by studying the minute details based on the introduction and evolution of Bharat Natyam in Sri Lanka. On the basis of various casts of sculptures and statutes can spell out the influence of the governed regime of a particular geographical zone through a time scale. This will help to identify a particular regime which dominated a notified area through various eras. To understand these facts, one has to study the comparative cultural variations that occurred in the past. The above factors are essential elements to study the origins, modifications and transformations that occurred in the past.
In Hinduism, different dance postures signify various gods based on their roles in epics. Lord Natarajas 108 Karanas reveal different philosophical meanings of the holy cosmic dance of the Lord. Most of the figures interpret the messages through different dancing gestures - postures based on Natya Sastra. The messages are conveyed through Abhinaya (physical expressions) including the body positions, face positions, neck positions, foot positions, different glances and different hand gestures.
Various transitions
A primary in this regard revealed some interesting facts about the old Hindu temples, their art galleries and sculptures. All these spell out the information about the historical evolution and various transitions that took place in the Sri Lankan Hindu temples. The current study also analyses the comparative data of South Indian chapter. Sri Lankan temple decorative sculptures have very close affinities with South Indian temples especially with the Tamil Nadu temples such as Thillai Nataraja temple at Chidambaram, Madurai Meenakshi temple, Tanjai Bracatheeswara temple, Mahabalipuram sculptures and numerous temples at Kanchipuram and many temples at Andra, Karnataka, and Kerala also.

Ozone layer to restore itself by 2060: UN
A latest scientific study has shown that the ozone layer has improved since the previous assessment carried out in 2014.
The report of the study Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 2018, carried out by the World Meteorological Organisation, United Nations Environment Programme, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the European Commission, was released on Monday.
The study monitors the recovery of ozone in the stratosphere, a layer that prevents ultraviolet rays passing through the atmosphere to the earths surface, every four years.
According to the executive summary of the report, Actions taken under the Montreal Protocol have led to decreases in the atmospheric abundance of controlled ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and the start of the recovery of stratospheric ozone.
According to the findings of the study, ozone in parts of the stratosphere has recovered at a rate of 1-3 percent since 2000.
At projected rates, Northern Hemisphere and mid-latitude ozone is scheduled to heal completely by the 2030s, followed by the Southern Hemisphere in the 2050s and Polar Regions by 2060, the report said.
However, it pointed out that continued success of the Montreal Protocol in protecting stratospheric ozone depends on continued compliance with the Protocol.
The study also found out that if the Kigali Amendment is fully implemented, the world can avoid up to 0.4 percent of global warming this century.
The Kigali Amendment, assuming global compliance, is projected to reduce future radiative forcing due to Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by about 50 percent in 2050, the report added.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), releasing a special report in the early October, highlighted that limiting global warming to 1.5C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.

PLANTERS BRIEF TREASURY SECRETARY ON ESTATE WAGE IMPASSE
Top Regional Plantation Company CEOs have told Treasury Secretary Sajith Attygalle on Monday afternoon that it was impossible for the RPCs to increase their daily wages to Rs. 1,000 per day from the current Rs. 840 on account of dwindling global tea prices now.
They have, instead, stressed the point that these estate workers earnings could even rise to between Rs. 1500 and Rs. 1800 per day in consonance with the productivity based wage model that the Planters  Association has proposed to the unions.
This follows a delegation from the Planters Association of Ceylon, the umbrella organization of the 23 Regional Plantation Companies briefing Treasury Secretary Sajith Attygalle on Monday.
This is a ludicrous situation that the estate unions have demanded an impossible Rs 1,000 per day wage increase with our inability to meet that demand on dwindling international tea prices, but, they have a much better probability of earning up to over Rs. 1,800 and beyond with the proposal that we have made which was a win- win situation for all, they told Attygalle. This is absurd and we wonder whether there was a political twist to this story, they said. The Treasury Secretary A had asked the Planters what their wish list from the Government was, to which the Planters had told him that they needed time to submit their demands, which sources said, revolved round, value addition and other industry related criteria such as legal, and finance.
The RPC CEOs had assured Attygalle that they would address these issues with their individual Boards of Directors and revert to him shortly. It was pointed out that the high end tea pluckers generally pluck around 45 kilos per day which means that their daily earnings could rise even beyond Rs. 1,800.
He also said that it was absurd for the estate unions to cry foul with the estate workers of the RPCs were getting Rs 46 per kilo of tea with all the other benefits of EPF and ETF, housing and health and education for children vis a vis the Tea Small Holders were getting a mere Rs. 25 per kilo of tea without any of the additional fringe benefits.

As far as I can see, nothing unconstitutional has happened. It is unusual, yes but we have had unusual things in the UK, we were supposed to have a five year fixed term but it was cut short, he said in a video released on Twitter yesterday.
He condemned the action of a junior member of the UK Parliament, Hugo Swire for raising the issue of Sri Lanka in the UK Parliament.
It is not up to a foreigner to decide whether it is constitutional or not. I am unhappy that a British junior minister stated that it was unconstitutional, that is not the role of UK Parliamentarians.
You have your own Constitution and we in the UK who take an interest in Sri Lanka of course want to help but I have been careful in my political career to not support any one party or do business with them.I suggest my colleagues do the same, added Lord Naseby in his video.

So Sri Lanka launched  at WTM London
Minister of Tourism and Wildlife Vasantha Senanayake unveiled new slogan and strategy for Sri Lanka Tourism at WTM in London.
The new slogan So Sri Lanka goes beyond being a place descriptor and embodies the vibrant qualities that inspire us about our travels and tales from the island nation.
At the launch of the new strategy and slogan the Minister Wasantha Senanayake said that the So Sri Lanka brand is not only exhilarating  its the beginning of a new era.
We envisage that tourism will flourish to be the most significant sector contributing to our economy - thats the goal we aspire to reach in the next few years, he said.
The Minister unveiled the new slogan along with Chief Guest of Honour Lord Nasby.
In the last 10 years, Sri Lanka has seen a steady growth in arrivals and investments. Based on qualitative research findings on inbound tourists for the last three years, the most endearing feature of Sri Lanka as a destination brand is its authenticity.
This authenticity is an attribute that is alive in the countrys heritage, cuisine, landscape, architecture, culture and mostly in its people. Recently, Lonely Planet ranked Sri Lanka as top destination to travel in 2019 based on its diverse and authentic offerings.
The resulting brand So Sri Lanka is laser focused on elevating Sri Lankas destination brand to include all its diverse offerings and unique attributes.
MsAlyna Hajji Omar, CEO, J Walter Thompson explained, The objective of the brand So Sri Lanka is to inspire us to proudly own our finer qualities while at the same time be open enough to continuously work on improvements. We have moved away from investing in a passive identity and we are seeking a dialogue with our socially active millennial travelers.

Speakers statement unconstitutional - BASL
The appointment of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa by President Maithripala Sirisena complies fully with the Constitution, Bar Association of Sri Lanka President U. R. De Silva, PC, said yesterday.
The BASL President while stressing that the statement made by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is unconstitutional said the President enjoys the exclusive power with regard to the prorogation and reconvening of Parliament. It can also be dissolved after four and a half years under the Constitution.
Article 70 of the Constitution ensures that President has full authority for the prorogation, reconvening, dissolution of Parliament after four and half years of Parliament and the conclusion of a Parliament session, he added. He said the President has the full authority to determine the date of reconvening Parliament and the Speaker can only make a request when Parliament is prorogued by the President. The Speaker can do nothing but make arrangements for the inauguration of the next Parliamentary session after the publication of the gazette notification on reconvening Parliament by the President.

Speaker clearly violated Constitution: Susil
Colombo District MP, former UPFA General Secretary, Cabinet Minister and Attorney Susil Premajayanth said that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should uphold the Constitution and asserted that he had no mandate or the authority to challenge the decisions and directives of President Maithripala Sirisena, constitutionally or otherwise.
This is serious and Speaker Jayasuriya has clearly overstepped his mandate and line of authority, he told the Daily News last night.
The MP was speaking in the wake of news releases that Speaker Jayasuriya had issued that he did not recognise the present Government and that the status quo should be restored to prior to the appointment of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and that the President did not have the mandate to sack Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
Explaining the position Constitutionally, Premajayanth explained that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had no mandate to oppose the prorogation of Parliament and reconvene the House ahead of the gazette notification issued by the President for Parliament to meet on November 14, which would be going against the decision of the President, of whom, he said was the sole authority of reconvening the House of Parliament.
It was only on Monday that the Fundamental Rights Petition was filed by Attorney Nanaganda Kodikuwakku was taken up in the Supreme Court and it was that there was no way that Parliament could be re-summoned ahead of November 14.
The Attorney General also told the Supreme Court that in no way could be decision of the President to prorogue Parliament could be challenged, MP Premajayanth explained.
Explaining further, he said that according to the Provisions of Article 33 Sub Section 2, it states very clearly and under the duties and powers of the President, it specifically states that to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament is the inherent power of the President.
With that power, the President has the power to prorogue Parliament and the Speaker has no business to overrule that decision or to do anything outside the gazette notification, Premajayanth said.
He also said that Article 42( 4) of the Constitution also specifically states that the President was vested with the powers of that office, to appoint a Prime Minister, whom in his opinion, who is most likely to command the confidence of the majority of the House
He said that it as patently clear that the mandate to appoint the Prime Minister was the sole authority and discretion of the President and that the Speaker had absolutely no business there. This is a clear cut violation of the Constitution by the Speaker as the Executive President is elected by the entire people of this country but the Prime Minister or the Speaker and other Members of Parliament was elected only for a particular District or Constituency.
That was the difference between the Executive President and all other politicians, he said.
Therefore, the President cannot delegate his Constitutional responsibilities to the Prime Minister and therefore, the Speaker has no mandate to either appoint or remove a Prime Minister, he remarked.
It is also up to the Speaker and MPs to uphold Constitution, he noted.

Speaker compromised role in Parliament - Former CJ
Former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya through his statement had compromised the independence of his role in Parliament and acted above and beyond his Constitutional powers.
I regret that the Speaker has issued such a statement. The honourable Speakers position has been respected in the Constitution. The present Speaker was elected through the UNP National List to Parliament and the members appointed him as Speaker. The Constitution clearly states that his sole function is to preside during the sittings of Parliament.
And he presides on the basis of a neutral person, he is the umpire, he has no role outside this,the former Chief Justice said.
The former Chief Justice in an interview with the Daily News said the Speaker had no power to recognise or not recognise a government.
He explained that as the head of the Legislature, the Speaker has to recognise persons appointed by the Executive, no matter who they are, Thereafter, what happens in Parliament is a different question.They can then move a vote of no confidence. But the Speaker should hold his hand until then, the former Chief Justice said.
He is now playing the role of the umpire by listening only to a few players, he said.
Silva pointed out that the legislature was not a matter of conscience as the Speaker highlighted in his letter, Earlier, acting according to his conscience he crossed over to the UPFA and accepted a ministerial portfolio, thereafter he came back- again according to his conscience. But this cannot be done according to his conscience. He must first identify what his role is. His role is to preside over Parliament in a neutral position. The moment he is perceived to be taking sides, it becomes difficult for him to control Parliament.
The very fact that he has entertained a letter (from 116 MPs) shows he has gone out of his role. The Constitution does not allow members to submit letters to the Speaker, especially outside of Parliament sittings. That gives the impression that he is partisan.
As a means of resolution to the current political crisis, the former Chief Justice urged the President to dissolve and to go in for fresh elections to decide once and for all, who had the power to govern.
The Sovereignty of the Republic of Sri Lanka rests with the people and no one else. So at such an instance, the President should dissolve Parliament and let the people decide who should govern them, he said.
He explained that though the 19th Amendment to the Constitution amended Article 70 of the Constitution to read that Parliament can only be dissolve after 4.5 years and with a two third majority, it also introduced Article 33 which stated that the President as the Executive had the power to summon, prorogue or dissolve Parliament,
In 2002, the Supreme Court decreed that the 19th Amendment introduced by the Ranil Wickremesinghe government at the time could not remove the Presidents power to dissolve Parliament without calling for a referendum. Dissolution has always been an Executive power and cant be taken away, without a referendum. So Article 33 had to be included in the current 19th Amendment to keep the power to dissolve Parliament in the hands of the President, otherwise the 19th Amendment would have needed a referendum.
The President has the power and should only exercise it when circumstances require. Given the instability, in the interest of the country and the people, Parliament should be dissolved, said the former CJ.

Speaker Karu faking a crisis
Former Deputy Speaker and MP Thilanga Sumathipala yesterday charged Speaker Karu Jayasuriya as deliberately misleading the House and the country by politicising procedures and maxims of Parliament by his un-speaker-like conduct.
He meets with ambassadors and holds discussions about addressing the countrys political problems, consistently highlighting that summoning of Parliament forthwith is a sine qua non for this, when the House is due to meet and sit on November14, and the powers for convening, proroguing and dissolving are prerogatives of the President under Sri Lankas Constitution, Sumathipala said.
A meeting had been held between Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and US ambassador to Sri Lanka Alaina B. Teplitz today.US embassy tweeted Met Speaker of Parliament Hon. Karu Jayasuriya @KaruOnline to discuss the importance of Parliament reconvening to put an end to this political crisis. These democratic institutions should serve the people of #SriLanka; let the elected representatives have their say.
Ten days have passed since the appointment of new Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa by the President of this country; Speaker Jayasuriya has not even made a courtesy call to congratulate him, he observed .
The Speaker had stated that he still accepts sacked former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the legitimate Prime Minister.
He is acting to the garden scenario as if it was the Speaker who appoints prime ministers of this country, explained Sumathipala, He is presumably creating confusion among the public. The country is stable now. People liked the transformation that had taken place.
He has issued statements about his opinions summoning the House, when those powers are constitutional prerogatives of the President.
Meanwhile, Constitutional experts told the Daily News about the current political situation, that nothing unconstitutional has happened so far in terms of proroguing of Parliament and appointing of a new Prime Minister by the President.
It must be borne in mind that content of a letter a signed by a set of Parliamentarians, in this case the letter handed over to the Speaker by political parties, the UNP, TNA, JVP and Muslim Congress, be it reasonable or unreasonable as per ones opinion, it should not be confused with the consistency of the Constitution because it must have one supreme power over and above all other power in the state, they added.

Demonstrating its commitment to product excellence once again, Swisstek Aluminium Limited was recently awarded the QUALICOAT certification for its aluminium products.
Swisstek Aluminium is the first and only aluminium manufacturer in Sri Lanka to receive this certification, which was awarded after its powder coated aluminium products passed several rigorous, standardised tests, involving carefully selected product-based criteria.
QUALICOAT is the ultimate international certification of product quality and is the aspiration of all manufacturers in the aluminium industry. However, very few even globally manufacture to the stringent specification set in order to receive this certification. This certification ensures that this product has been manufactured to globally validated criteria encompassing strength, durability and product lifespan.
Swisstek is proud to be the only Sri Lankan organisation to receive this certification and this is testament to our unwavering commitment to provide the Sri Lankan consumer with the highest quality product, said Mahendra Jayasekera, Managing Director, Swisstek Aluminium Limited.

Taking science to the people
World Science Day falls every year on November 10. It highlights the significant role of science in society and its importance and relevance in our daily lives and at work.
Recalling that everyone has a right to participate in and benefit from science, the day will serve to spark a global discussion on ways to improve access to science and to the benefits of science for sustainable development.
In a societal point of view, science should provide quality solutions to our daily problems, as well as to technical and philosophical issues. On the other hand, in order to deliver those expectations, science requires a high level of support from society.
However, science also needs to regularly engage in communication with society. Feedback and understanding from the citizens are essential to improve science and to offer the right solutions. This is where Sri Lanka has failed. In our country, communication between scientists, citizens and policymakers still represents a major challenge.
Since mid-1960s, successive Governments have invested in science education and curriculum reforms and throughout the years have sought to improve the quality of science education. Despite these investments and reforms, there is serious concern about their outcomes. Recent research has found that students are not able to demonstrate acceptable levels of achievement in applying their scientific knowledge to everyday situations.
Need for a new Science Policy
It is time we address these challenges and seriously consider right pathways for the future. In this writers opinion, two important steps have to be taken immediately. Firstly, the current policy initiatives supporting science education need to be thoroughly examined. Secondly, the science programme in schools needs to be reviewed taking into account parameters such as curriculum, teaching and learning methods, learning assessments, teaching material and deployment and training of science teachers.
In 2010, the National Science and Technology Policy was developed with strategies to encourage student-directed inquiry and practical skills. Although it was not comprehensive, it was a good policy statement. For a start, this document could be used as a base to derive a suitable new science education policy for the next two to three decades. The two premier national scientific bodies, the Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement for Science (SLAAS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) can assist in this endeavour.
The curriculum is the most important factor in any science education policy. And, the common denominator of any science curriculum is to present science and technology integrated together in a social context. Its explicit objectives should aim to overcome the drawbacks of the present traditional science education programme, such as the lack of students interest in science and technology, their low enrolment in these studies, and the marked inequality affecting different areas and so forth.
At the end, however, the common vision of the finalised science policy should solve three important issues: (1) increase scientific and technological literacy of citizens, (2) generate science and technology interest in students, (3) help students improve critical thinking, logical reasoning, creative problem solving, and decision making.
The contents of science education should be selected based on two criteria: one, focusing on relevant scientific and technological issues that affect traditional Sri Lankan society, and the other, on social and cultural aspects of science and technology, derived from the foreign academic tradition.
The former allows a better connection between a students interests and the academy, but can lead to a partial and too specialized education due to its more specific nature. The second approach, more general, could provide students with a more comprehensive and durable structure.
Communication
Science communication is part of a scientists everyday life. Scientists must give talks, write papers and proposals, communicate with a variety of audiences, and educate others. Thus, to be successful, regardless of field or career path, scientists must learn how to communicate effectively.
When scientists are able to communicate effectively beyond their peers to broader, non-scientist audiences, three things happen simultaneously. It builds support for science, promotes understanding of its wider relevance to society, and encourages more informed decision-making at all levels, from government to communities to individuals. It can also make science accessible to audiences that traditionally have been excluded from the process of science.
Training
Although having more scientists who are effective communicators benefits science and society greatly, there are still relatively few training opportunities in Sri Lanka for science students and professionals to develop these skills. In the modern world, effective communication skills are no longer perceived as born skills. Increasingly, they are becoming part of the core professional skills every science student and professional should have.
Plans must be made, therefore, to develop more science communication training programmes and courses for scientists. Schools and universities have a major role to play in this endeavour but in order to establish a culture of lifelong learning, the other agencies must also be involved.
Each sector of the scientific community should consider providing training on communication and greater understanding of the media, arranging non-specialist lectures and demonstrations, organising scientific competitions for younger people, providing briefings for journalists and generally by improving their public relations.
Role of mass media
Science is relatively well represented in the mainstream news media in Sri Lanka, with editors of major news outlets indicating they believe science is an important component of the daily news stream. However, science is not well represented in general programming, being under represented in factual and documentary programming.
The quality of science coverage in the mainstream media could be improved by providing support for scientists to communicate more effectively with the media and for journalists to report on complex science issues, in each case through on-the-job professional development augmented by well supported training.
The quantity, diversity and depth of science coverage in the mainstream media could be extended by the creation of more stimulating science images and interactives suitable for new and traditional media.
Parliamentarians
Better overall understanding of science among Parliamentarians would significantly improve the quality of public decision-making. It is not because the right decisions would then be made, but because decisions made in the light of an adequate understanding of the issues are likely to be better than decisions made in the absence of such understanding. Likewise, better understanding of science by the higher levels of the administrative service should also lead to better policies.
It is obvious then that better public understanding of science can be a major element in promoting national prosperity, in raising the quality of public and private decision-making and in enriching the life of the individual. Improving the public understanding of science is an investment in the future, not a luxury to be indulged in if and when resources allow.
Other initiatives
There are many other initiatives taken by countries to close the gap between science and society. The National Science Week is one such popular programme. Its a countrywide annual programme involving various stakeholders and actors conducting science-based activities during the week. It targets at the various levels of society such as students, educators, scientists, youth, public sector, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the private sector.
Another example is Citizen Science. The European Commission defines it as the general public engagement in scientific research activities when citizens actively contribute to science either with their intellectual effort or surrounding knowledge or with their tools and resources. Participants provide experimental data and facilities for researchers, raise new questions and co-create a new scientific culture.
This initiative involves scientists and non-scientists in projects dealing with real-world questions, and it has been shown that they can be successful, not only in the strict science, but also in engaging non-scientists in the scientific process.

Is there life after Herath
When Muthiah Muralitharan ended his distinguished international cricket career in 2010 at Galle with a world record haul of 800 Test wickets Sri Lanka were fortunate to have someone in the calibre of Rangana Herath waiting in the wings to slip into his shoes.
Its a crying shame that Heraths career (he made his Test debut in 1999) ran parallel with Muralitharans and he had only opportunities few and far between to play for his country until the great man eventually retired almost a decade later.
It was Heraths perseverance against all odds to ply his trade continuously despite the frustrations of being unable to represent his country that eventually proved to Sri Lankas benefit. For when Muralitharan quit there was already a readymade spinner at hand not only to take over but continue to bowl his team to victories.
The biggest challenge Sri Lanka faces today is who is going to fill Heraths shoes after he calls it a day at the end of the ongoing first cricket Test against England at Galle
There is none as experienced as Herath was when he replaced Muralitharan in the national team. When Muralitharan retired Herath had by then played in 18 Tests and captured 59 wickets over a ten-year period.
What we have on the table today are three potential candidates vying for Heraths place in the team  left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara, off-spinner Akila Dananjaya and left-arm chinaman bowler Lakshan Sandakan. Their combined wickets tally amounts to 15 Tests and 52 wickets - 3 Tests and seven wickets less than Herath. Dananjaya has 17 wickets from 3 Tests, Pushpakumara 5 from 2 and Sandakan 30 from 10.
This is where Sri Lanka will struggle to win Test matches for none of them are capable of running through a batting side like how Muralitharan and Herath used to do.
What they lack is experience and exposure at the highest level and until such time they reach that level of competence Sri Lanka will be hardpressed for wins on a consistent basis.
Sandakan began his career on a high capturing nine wickets in a Herath dominated series against Australia in 2016 that Sri Lanka won 3-0. He had 20 wickets in his first 6 Tests, but has struggled in his last four Tests that have brought him only 10 wickets.
Pushpakumaras played only one series against India at home and his five wickets has cost 47.60, while Dananjaya with his bagful of tricks up his sleeve looks the most promising for in the three Tests hes played Sri Lanka has never lost a series winning two (v Bangladesh and South Africa) and drawing against West Indies.
With Herath gone the onus will be on 36-year-old off-spinner Dilruwan Perera to spearhead the spin bowling department. He has been around long enough bowling in tandem with Herath to know what is required to make Sri Lanka a match-winning unit. There have been occasions where Perera has on more than one occasion stolen the limelight from Herath and bowled his country to victory.
The standout performances are his 10/99 against Australia at Galle in 2016 and 10/78 against South Africa in July this year both Tests that Sri Lanka won and both taking place at Galle.
Perera has been hardly prone to injuries and if he can keep himself fit for the next few years, Sri Lanka can benefit by his experience until one of the younger spinners develop into a potential match winner. In that aspect Perera has a big role to play in developing the successor to Herath.
Heraths opinion is that Dilruwan, Sandakan, Malintha and Akila are all good spinners but when they come to the side what is needed is to give them the confidence and support and, more games to play.
They need a little bit more time to get settled and the confidence while playing, then they will learn and deliver their best, said Herath.
Just take my career the first ten years although I played some Tests I was not consistent I was struggling even performance wise. But if you take my last 20 years you can see consistency.
Sri Lanka cricket is in for some tough times ahead in the absence of a potential match-winner.

Touring Sri Lanka with the Lions and a stint with Colts helped me  Foakes
GALLE, Tuesday: Englands first day hero Ben Foakes who scored an unbeaten 87 not out on the first day of the first Test at the Galle International Stadium said that the experience of his short stint with Colombo Colts CC and a tour of Sri Lanka with the England Lions side helped him to counter the heat and the Lankan spinners.
Coming out here a few times, you get good experience. On the Lions tour it was really good. Also I played for Colts for a while, where (Dilruwan) Perera and Akila Dananjaya play I got to learn a little bit about them which was fantastic, said Foakes at the end of the day.
It definitely (helped me). Also, the thing you cant really prepare for is the heat, unless youve done it. I think playing in this sort of heat a few times really helped.
Foakes solid innings helped England to recover from 103-5 to a healthy 321-8 by the close and with some luck he may be able to score a hundred on his Test debut.
Batting with him is Englands no. 10 Jack Leach on 14 with James Anderson to come.
Foakes who plays for the same county Surrey as Sri Lankan legend Kumar Sangakkara did till 2017, said that it was only yesterday (Monday) that he found out during training that he was going to play in the first Test.
When Rooty (Joe Root) came to me and said that I was playing, I was quite shocked to be fair. I didn't think I'd be playing. I was a little surprised and it was a proud moment, said Foakes.
On debut sometimes you don't even know what's on the scoreboard, I was a bit nervous and in my own head. I was just thinking grind in and when I got off the mark obviously that settled me down a bit, he said.
Assessing the Galle pitch, Foakes said, When I first went in, I found it quite tough. It was sticking in and quite tacky so you didnt really feel like you could play your shots too well. It dried out a bit throughout the day so you got a little bit more value. You could play strong shots. The new ball was quite tricky.
Foakes said that he was holidaying in Lisbon when he heard from the England chairman of selectors Ed Smith.
I just got back from a lads trip to Lisbon...good preparation! I'd had a few days out there when Ed gave me a ring. I'd heard about Jonny's ankle but I still wasn't sure if I'd be coming out, it took me by surprise, said Foakes.
I think it's been quite a few years of Lions stuff, that month just getting away was good. It's been a long time without any break. That month was beautiful, just in my head not thinking I had cricket round the corner, so I could arrive here fresh.
Foakes was a late inclusion in the England Test squad after Jonny Bairstow was ruled out of the ongoing Test series having twisted his ankle playing a game of football.
Sri Lankan spinner Dilruwan Perera said that Foakes had a good plan against spin having played in these conditions before.
Ben played in 2012 a few limited over games for Colts. But after that he has toured here with England Lions and he has a fair idea on what to expect and he had a good plan against spin, said Perera who was Sri Lankas most successful bowler finishing the day with four wickets for 70.
Perera who is familiar with the Galle pitch having on two occasions taken match bags of ten wickets in Tests said that this was not the usual Galle pitch they are familiar with.
The wicket was covered for two days and I think that took away the usual advantage we have here."
"The wicket spun but once the ball got older, the wicket started to be slow, said Perera. The wicket I dont think will deteriorate too much. It is a bit slow and hopefully that will help us. We were playing one seamer and we wanted to bat first.
But the toss you cannot depend on too much.

Claims of toxic pesticides in vegetables:
Toxic cocktail of myth and truth
According to a news report, a scientific meeting of the Department of Agriculture (DOA) was held in Peradeniya on September 6 and 7 on Agriculture beyond production. One aspect of this topic was bringing farm produce to the consumer with the minimum of waste. It is well known that 40 to 60 percent of agricultural products are wasted; attacked by bugs, microbes, vermin etc., and become rotten before it reaches the market, especially in tropical countries. Another aspect of this study was an evaluation of potentially toxic pesticide residues found in vegetables.
Concern about toxins in food has been sharpened by the organic food movement. It is currently in a global market struggle to capture supermarket space for its products. Here the upper-class elites who adopt Californian concerns, and the romantic traditionalists who claim a golden past have joined hands. They espouse organic food, and seek a Toxin-Free Nation even in Sri Lanka by adopting many myths of Western green activists. They have their own myths too  ancient Lankans were well-fed and lived long, Methuselah-like, using only traditional agriculture without pesticides and fertilizers, except for natural fertilizers. They ignore the written record of multiple famines and the record of sequential droughts seen in the rings of South-Asian tree trunks studied by dendro-climatologists. The heady claim that Lanka was the granary of the East is a literal truth to these romantics. In reality, the common people teetered between subsistence and famine, while only the palace and temple had it good.
Given the heightened concern about pesticide residues in food, the presentation by Yoshida Lakshani, a scientist from the laboratory of the Registrar of pesticides has attracted media interest.
The study was in collaboration with J.A. Sumith, K. Rajapaksha, B. Bambaradeniya and T. Chathurangi from Wayamaba University. Popular leafy vegetables such as Gotukola (Centellaasiatica) and Mukunuwenna (Alternantherasessilis) grown in Kalutara, Puttalam and Kandy districts had been tested; residues of four popular pesticides were found in 50 percent of the samples, most of which came from the Puttalam area, with the Kandy district coming second.
Pesticides in food
Four insecticides were found in significant quantities in vegetables. Of these, the most significant amounts first were for the insecticide fipronil. This is used to control ants, beetles, cockroaches, fleas, ticks, termites, mole crickets, thrips, rootworms, weevils, and other insects. The maximum allowed limit (MAL) on this insecticide residue on leafy vegetables is five parts per billion (ppb) in some countries. That is, only one teaspoon of the residue finely distributed in one thousand metric tons of the vegetable is allowed! On the other hand, the US limit is one ppb, while twice as much is allowed in tea, and 10 times as much is allowed on rice! Does the pesticide become ten times less toxic when found in rice
No, at all. The maximum allowed limit quoted is not a measure of toxicity; it is a measure of good farming practice (GFP), with differing GFP based MALs for different crops, and in different countries. The public, journalists, Green-Lobby groups like the AVAAZ team, and even many medical doctors who write about public health matters do not understand that this MAL has nothing to do with toxicity.
While the Department of Agriculture is interested in ensuring GFP, scientists should instruct reporters to use these numbers correctly. They should not use these tiny ppbs to fan public fear. What they need is not the GFP-MALs, but the admissible daily intake (ADI) for chronic toxicity arising from the ingestion of such insecticide residues. These are stipulated jointly by the WHO and FAO. Chronic toxicity is the form of slow poisoning that occurs if you take a small amount of a substance for many years. If the intake is less than the ADI, then there is no health risk.
WHO-FAO (Sept. 2016) ADI of fipronil is 0.0002 mg/kg of body weight. So, an adult weighing 60 kg should take less than 0.012 mg of this insecticide daily, to avoid chronic toxicity. According to Yhoshida Lakshani, gotukola and mukunuwenna had 372 ppb of fipronil residues. Thus, eating such gotukola or Mukunuwenna becomes risky for eating about 35 grams (7 spoons) of it without cooking or cleaning. Washing will not remove these insecticides as they are largely water insoluble.
However, washing and cooking are very important as vegetables in tropical countries are contaminated with amoeba, shigella, E-coli, hookworm and other organisms. They are more dangerous than small amounts of insecticide residues found in crops.
How much is more
Furthermore, if vegetables are cooked with some water in an open pan (i.e., adopting the Sri Lankan method of making a 'maelluma'), the pesticide volatilizes with the steam. According to research by Xavier and collaborators ( Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Volume 186, p 5429), even sun drying, or dipping in solutions of tamarind, turmeric, vinegar, and slaked lime and wet scrubbing could remove more than 90 % of fipronil residues. Even if nothing is done, the fipronil disappears with a half life of about four days. So, not applying the insecticide close to harvesting greatly reduces the level of fipronil contamination.
Secondly, she spoke of Profenofos. This insecticide is used against mealy bugs, caterpillars, and aphids. The European MAL for this is 10 parts per billion (ppb), while the US limit is 1000 ppb, i.e., some 100 times higher. This does not mean that the substance suddenly becomes 100 times less toxic when inside the USA, but simply that different farming practices (mainly used on cotton) are used, and within those practices, one may tolerate 100 times more insecticide residues than in colder Northern Europe.
From a health point of view, the admissible daily intake (ADI) for chronic toxicity applies. The WHO-FAO stipulates 0.03 mg per kg of body weight per day as the ADI, while China uses 1.0 mg/kg of body weight. An adult weighing 60 kg may take up to 60 mg every day. According to a Divaina newspaper report (3-11-2018), Lakshani had found some 7583 ppb of this insecticide while the MAL quoted by her was 10 ppb. So, the reporter had concluded that the pesticide residues were alarmingly high and pose a health risk. Instead, if we use the Chinese ADI value of 60 mg, given a contamination level of 7583 ppb, a 60 kg man must eat over 79kg of vegetable per day. If we use 0.03 mg/kg of body weight as the ADI, it is still about 2.4kg of the contaminated vegetable daily to run a health risk!
Hence, the claim that eating such vegetables poses a health risk is utter nonsense. However, the use of excess pesticide is a waste of money. Nor should we load it to the ecosystem even if the decay times
are short.
Thirdly she found Phenthoate. This is used against moths, leaf-hoppers, aphids, soft scales, mosquitoes, blowflies, houseflies, and louse flies. An MAL of 0.5 parts per million (ppm) or 500 ppb for vegetables is used in the US. The ADI which defines chronic toxicity is 0.001-0.003 mg of phenthoate per kg of body weight. So, an adult may intake up to 0.06-18 mg daily without posing a health risk. If the gotukola or Mukunuwenna had, say, 300 ppb of the insecticide, it is necessary to eat about 3 to18 kg of the vegetable DAILY for there to be a health risk from the pesticide residues. Hence, phenthoate residues pose absolutely no health risk.
Fourthly, Tebuconazole; this is a fungicide used agriculturally to treat fungi that affect plants. Its ADI is generally considered to be 0.03 mg/kg of body weight, which corresponds to a maximum daily intake of 1.8 g. That is, if this fungicide is found in amounts of, say, 300 ppb, an adult has to eat 180 kg of the vegetable, i.e., three times the body weight, for it to pose a health risk!
And lastly Glyphosate; although glyphosate has been very much in the news, it has not figured at the Peradeniya meeting. Instead, we go to the Sri Lanka Medical Association journal (SLMA) where a lecture by Dr. Sanath Gunatilake (SG) is reported in August 2018. SG is a California doctor who joined with Senanayake (a Kelaniya psychic), and Dr. Jayasumana (a recent medical graduate) in publishing an article claiming that glyphosate causes kidney disease in the Northcentral province. SG claims that the adjuvants (substances added in small amounts to glyphosate formulations) are a thousand times more toxic. Yet, he ignores that these same adjuvants are also found in greater amounts in common shampoos and household detergents. Field trials show that the adjuvants are found in parts per trillion (truly negligible and at the limit of detection) in the blood of farmers who use the herbicide regularly.
Dr. Gunatillake too makes the mistake that the agricultural MALs determine toxicity. SG and the public who read the websites and newsletters of EcoWatch, Organic Consumers, Dr. Mercola, Moms across America, Whole-Food consumers, Beyond Pesticides, Detox, Food-democracy-Now, Avaaz team, Alliance for Natural Health, etc., ignore what the MRLs imply, and talk of alarmingly dangerous levels of pesticides in food after comparing pesticide residues with the MALs.
Contrary to what seemed to be assumed by Dr. Gunatilake, and by most members of the public including various Jurors who pronounce on glyphosate lawsuits, we already noted that the MALs are not related to the health risk from the contamination, but to good agricultural practice! When Dr. SG claims (SLMA Journal) that Taiwan set a limit of 1 ppb of glyphosate in Oates, he should ask why America allows 30 ppm of glyphosate in the same Oates, i.e., 30,000 times more! It clearly cannot be a matter of toxicity of the glyphosate residues to human health!
Sometimes MRLs are mere weapons of trade wars. In Sri Lanka, it has been a political weapon in the hand of the Toxin-free lobby which ignores particulate dust, exhaust-gas pollution, urban garbage mounds, and many other acute health risks. Sri Lanka lost over 60 billion in three years due to the ban on glyphosate, debilitated the tea farmer and destroyed the maize farmers.

Trump petitions SC in effort to kill Dreamers programme
The Trump administration is seeking the conservative-leaning Supreme Court's endorsement to kill the Dreamers programme, which protects about 1.8 million undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children.
Late Monday the Justice Department announced it was bypassing regional Appellate Benches and going straight to the Supreme Court to gain support for its effort to end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme.
The move came on the eve of midterm congressional elections in which Trump and Republicans portrayed illegal immigration as a threat to US security.
Solicitor General Noel Francisco said injunctions by three lower courts have prevented the administration from ending the programme, which the Trump administration says has only encouraged people to try to enter the United States illegally.
Cancelling the program could result in the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of people who have grown up inside the United States after being brought into the country illegally as children years and sometimes decades ago.
Many of them now have families and jobs of their own and are well integrated into US society.
The government argues that the injunctions have prevented the Department of Homeland Security from moving ahead with Trump's September 2017 order to rescind the DACA policy.
The policy, put into place by former President Barack Obama, protected from deportation 700,000 Dreamers registered under the programme and another 1.1 million who qualify but are not registered.

In unison with Chinese creativity
Chinese painting is one of the oldest continuous artistic traditions in the world. Painting in the traditional style is known today in Chinese as guhu meaning national or native painting, as opposed to Western styles of art which became popular in China in the 20th century. Traditional painting involves essentially the same techniques as calligraphy and is done with a brush dipped in black ink or coloured pigments; oils are not used. As with calligraphy, the most popular materials on which paintings are made are paper and silk. The finished work can be mounted on scrolls, such as hanging scrolls or handscrolls. Traditional painting can also be done on album sheets, walls, lacquerware, folding screens, and other media.
Landscape painting was regarded as the highest form of Chinese painting, and generally still is. The time from the Five Dynasties period to the Northern Song period (9071127) is known as the Great age of Chinese landscape. In the north, artists such as Jing Hao, Li Cheng, Fan Kuan, and Guo Xi painted pictures of towering mountains, using strong black lines, ink wash, and sharp, dotted brushstrokes to suggest rough stone. In the south, Dong Yuan, Juran, and other artists painted the rolling hills and rivers of their native countryside in peaceful scenes done with softer, rubbed brushwork. These two kinds of scenes and techniques became the classical styles of Chinese landscape painting.
The earliest paintings were not representational but ornamental; they consisted of patterns or designs rather than pictures. Early pottery was painted with spirals, zigzags, dots, or animals.
It was only during the Warring States period (475221 BC) that artists began to represent the world around them. In imperial times (beginning with the Eastern Jin dynasty), painting and calligraphy in China were among the most highly appreciated arts in the court and they were often practised by amateursaristocrats and scholar-officialswho had the leisure time necessary to perfect the technique and sensibility necessary for great brushwork. Calligraphy and painting were thought to be the purest forms of art.
The implements were the brush pen made of animal hair and black inks made from pine soot and animal glue. In ancient times, writing, as well as painting, was done on silk. However, after the invention of paper in the 1st century AD, silk was gradually replaced by the new and cheaper material. Original writings by famous calligraphers have been greatly valued throughout Chinas history and are mounted on scrolls and hung on walls in the same way that paintings are.
The Chinese Style International Tour of Modern Chinese Water-Ink Paintings Exhibition was held at China Cultural Center recently in association with Art news of China and Central Digital TV Chinese Art Channel.
This unique exhibition did host some of the modern paintings of Chinese style crafted with water and Ink, a speciality with the Chinese paintings.
The artists involved in the exhibition were representatives of contemporary Chinese art circles. The portrayals depicted the history of Chinese innovation, inheritance and development. Chinese water-ink painting is an independent form of art which heals the mind and the spirit at the same time. This freehand brushwork integrates poetry, calligraphy, painting and seal art and influences the evolution of contemporary Chinese water-ink paintings. Furthermore, it was categorized into three sects such as character, landscape, flower and bird series.
The exhibits were a new experience for the visitors and the China Cultural Centre alike in capturing the progress of the modern art of Chinese origin.
The exhibition was held free of charge to the public with the courtesy of the Chinese Embassy. The Chinese Embassy shouldered this initiative as part of the National Day Ceremonies of the Peoples Republic of China which is being held in the months of September and October.

UNP's missed opportunity
UNPers who voted to elect Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena on January 8, 2015 were by no means betrayed by him, going by the disclosure made by the President at the rally tiled Ratama Rakina Jana Mahimaya held at the Parliament roundabout on Monday.
The common thread that marks the comments made by the UNP spokesmen, post October 26, is to the effect that President Sirisena had backstabbed not only their leader Ranil Wickremesinghe through his ouster but also all UNP voters who braved grave odds to elect the former as President. They also charge the President for acting unconstitutionally in this regard and also kicking away the mandate granted to him. The President is also accused by the UNP of making its supporters orphaned by joining hands with his onetime arch rival.
However, it is now clear that the President had never intended to shortchange the UNP voters who comprised the bulk of the 6.2 million votes received by him on January 8. Not by a long way. On the contrary he came close to realizing the aspirations of the vast majority of party supporters as the readers could gather while going through this piece.
Addressing the mammoth crowd, the President explained the course he adopted to replace Wickremesinghe with an alternative from among the UNP itself. This is because the conduct and the path taken by the former Prime Minister was to the detriment of the country and its traditional values, not to mention the economic ruin wrought, he explained.
He (President) named two alternatives who would have been acceptable not only to the UNP but the vast populace, across party lines - one of them being Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and the other, former minister Sajith Premadasa. Jayasuriya, no doubt, had all the credentials for the post, being of impressive stature, sober bearing, rooted in the nation's cultural ethos and a true Buddhist, while Premadasa Jnr. would have been no less acceptable to UNPers- nay their favourite choice for long as party leader, for, like his late father, he is close to the common man and devoid of the elitist patina of his leader.
However, according to the President, both declined the offer, obviously not wanting to rub their leader on the wrong side. Hence, the decision he took to offer former President Mahinda Rajapaksa the Premiership.
President Sirisena said he met the Speaker eight months ago and insisted that he take over the Premiership. I pleaded with him (Jayasuriya) for several days to become the PM because I could no longer work with Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister. But he declined to accept the post citing his inability to pose a challenge to Wickremesinghe. Ditto for Sajith Premadasa.
The President said the sacking of Wickremesinghe represented not only a change in personalities but also a political programme that was alien to the national way of thinking, cut off from the country's cultural ethos, and geared to serve the interests of external forces.
The new appointee, according to the President, was an individual who was attuned to the value system. It is clear, therefore, that President Sirisena, far from being ungrateful to the UNP voters, sought to appoint two individuals who in fact would have greatly enhanced the prospects of the UNP at future elections. In others words the President was doing a service to the UNP wittingly or unwittingly.
Karu Jayasuriya may, or may not be, a spent force politically. But not so Sajith. With every election defeat suffered by the Grand Old Party the outcry among the party grassroots was for the appointment of Premadasa as the party leader. This call has not diminished today amidst the bitter reversal suffered by Wickremesinghe, whom his loyalists in the party had sought to portray as a victim of a conspiracy. This was clearly evident when the UNP was organising its protest rally in Kollupitiya following Wickremesinghe's ouster, a party Local Government member from Dambulla declared they were coming that day to install Sajith as party leader and not to support Ranil.
He was only echoing the sentiments of the bulk, if not all, grassroots party supporters. He, like others of his ilk among the Greens, may have been thoroughly disappointed by this missed opportunity and may be inwardly cursing Sajith for letting them down badly, by not accepting the President's offer.
Besides, President Sirisena has never failed to acknowledge the leading role the UNP played in his election to office. Symbolizing this, he even visited UNP Headquarters, Sirikotha, for its annual convention - a first by a rival political leader. In his address to the nation following the advent of the new Government President Sirisena was magnanimous in appreciating the support he received from UNP voters in his election and appealed to the Greens to join him in the task of nation building.
This extension of the hand of friendship indicates that the President still needs their support. Hence, it would be better for all if this political gridlock is resolved soon and the country put on the fast track to development.

Unseen, unheard, but always near
Letters, diary entries, random jottings and journals left behind by eminent persons have later become a prestigious legacy. They have, over the years, gone into the publications to be read in all cultures. Lasting examples such as the first Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehrus correspondence with his daughter exist.
Then come the letters and journals written over the years by the two French writers of fame, Andre Gide and Marcel Proust. The posthumous collections have given way to various kinds of reinterpreted and reconstructed poems, narratives, theatrical works, films and profiles. Through letters sent by one person to another or more than one person, the alternative visions and insights into the social fabric could be gauged.
Lifetime companion
With a keen interest in that area, I began reading a rare and resourceful collection of letters written by Pierre Barge addressed to his friend and lifetime companion, Yves Saint-Laurent. The collection is titled Letters to Yves (2010).
I have not discovered the original writer, Pierre Berge, before. Most of his books have not come as English translations. The incumbent work, in the form of a collection of letters, has been transformed as a narrative culmination. The collection is in the search of two individuals. Berge, the letter-writer, recollects the memorable moments in their life together. The letters are addressed to the great fashion designer following his death revealing the carefree days the enjoyed exploring fame in the world of arts.
The series could be perceived as one vision based on various points of view. First, it is a farewell expression of Berge to Yves. The very first letter is written on June 20, 2008. It is a flashback to the moment when they met each other and how it evolved into a lasting relationship.
The morning in Paris was so youthful and beautiful when we met! You were engaged in your first battle. That day you found fame and glory and they never left you. (13pp)
[SUBHEAD] Innermost intimacies
In introspection, the series of narrative letters is lined up to reveal the innermost intimacies. Yves is no more, yet Berge goes on to say: And so Yves, this is what I wanted to say. We have to part now, and I dont know how to do that, because I will never level you  did we ever leave one another (16pp)
The letters, from a broader perspective, resemble the sensitive spiritual messages sent to a dear departed. The letter written on December 25, 2008, is an example.
I just reread the eulogy I delivered at the church of Saint Roch, the day of your funeral. It is basically a letter written to you. An open and public letter. You are unable to hear me, either yesterday or today. And so, why do I want to write you, and continue the dialogue that I began six months ago (17pp)
The letters reveal the moment of bliss in the world of enjoying music, painting and going to the theatre. Berge exposes the bliss of enjoying their life via the works of art as a fused entity. The human relations with each other whose like-mindedness is shown as the greatest blessings one can possess in human existence. They are disregarded as blasphemy.
The letters are sensitive. Sometimes to the extent that they reveal the use and even the bliss of drugs in a mild form. It also reveals how one could abuse the substance under addiction and violation of human intimacies. As the letters are written quite a number of references are made to various sources of knowledge acquisition.
Beautiful summer
Most references allude to the texts and documents they used while they were discussing various salient factor pertaining to the world of arts. There are references to rare poems.
Spring and my beautiful summer
Have leapt from the window
Nothing is as it was
The cold of winter pierces me. (27pp)
As if looking up oneself, in a lonely room, Berge gives the sense that he has a flow of ideas to be written down on the paper. Each letter resembles the quality of a chapter in a narrative. The letters at times resemble a stream of consciousness. The writer transcends the common expressive mood and enters a world of fantasy.
The letters go back to the places that the two companions traversed years ago. Marakash is one such place. It looks as if it is a dreamland that they created for themselves.
Pierre Berge happens to be a writer of fame and was appointed a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador in 1993. He met Yves Saint-Laurent in 1959. On April 21, 2015, President Francois Holland promoted him to Grand Officer Status of the Order Nationale de la legion dhonneur.

Why translation matters
Senaratne Weerasinghe has earned reputation as a translator equipped with the capacity to capture the essence and nuances of the original novels effectively. With his wide experience as a translator, Weerasinghe does justice to whatever the work at hand. The latest batch of translation to come from Weerasinghes desk includes Kung Fu saha Vilangu, Kung Fu saha Vandage Pilivetha, Dugi Sittarage Adaravanthiya and Kung Fu saha Andha Vishvasaya.
Why does translation matter The subject is so huge, so complex, and so dear to heart. In a world where English is everywhere, translation is an absolute necessity. English is the third most widely-spoken language in terms of native speakers, of which it has at least 330 million. But if you count the people who speak it as a second language, its the most popular language in the world.
According to Chinese belief, kung fu is as fast as wind, as stable as mountains and as powerful as fire. Its origins come from manual labour and the imitation of animals, and today it is practised by all, no matter their age, gender or size.
Dating back thousands of years, the ancient tradition of Chinese kung fu has been passed down throughout generations to help preserve the essence of Chinese culture. Derived from the words g ng and fu, which roughly translated means achievement through great effort, its about using fighting skills in combat to defeat and kill, requiring coordination between the hands, legs, steps, body and mind.
Composed of extensive systems of codified practices, each system requires long-term practice to master. However, Chinese kung fu values practice of the body as much as that of the heart and the mind.
Practice not only makes one stronger, healthy and well-toned, but also cultivates the mind and enhances ones inner beauty. One common misconception surrounding kung fu is that every Buddhist monk practices it, since the religion teaches that body and mind must be cultivated to achieve enlightenment. However, some monks practice Taiji, a slower form of kung fu, or even yoga.
It is not mysterious, everyone can undertake training. Kung fu is good for health and self-defence. Now, kung fu is widely practiced around the world.
Practitioners have different many reasons to begin kung fu, ranging from improving their health and becoming stronger to improving self-discipline and self-confidence. Senaratne Weerasinghe deserves much kudos for introducing a wide array of the Kung Fu tradition to the Sri Lankan readership.

Yesuras world
Readers would have observed that among the new developments in the North of the country, a taste for artistic film appreciation has become evident as for the third time Yaalpaanam (Jaffna) had held an International Film Festival.
One of the major literary figures in the Thamil cultural scene is A Jesurasa and in the North the younger generation flock to him to update themselves in all matters pertaining to the arts as he had been a poet, short story writer, literary magazines editor, translator and a literary and film critic.
His importance is felt by everybody in Yaalpaanam, although some may disagree with his interpretations.
Published by his own concern, Alai Veliyeedu book has 104 pages.
Prof E Sornavel, Associate Professor of Michigan State University in the U.S. has found him a person with a deep understanding of the film medium and recommends his book for researchers and students of the cinema.
The bibliography of Yesurasa is as follows:
1. Tholaivum Iruppum, aenaiya kathaikalum (Distance, Existence and Other Stories) 1974 and 1989. In my review of the book, I found him an Existential writer.
2. Ariyap Padaathavarkal Ninaivaaka (In Memory of the Unknown)- poems -1984
3. Panimalai (Snow Rain) Translated poems
4. Thoovaanam (Drizzle) Columns 2001
5. Pathivukal (Recordings)- Columns 2003
6. Kuripeddil Irunthu (From the Diary) -Literary Essays -2007
7. Ninavuk Kurippukal (Notes on Remembrances) Essays- 2016
8. Thiraium Arangum: Kalai Veliyil oru Payanam (A Journey Thru the Space of Arts) Essays on the Cinema-2013
9. Nilakal (Shadows) Articles on Films  2018.
As for me, I enjoy thoroughly almost all his nine books because the writer is very critical of the trends in the local cultural scene. His honesty is appreciated, although one may not readily accept his views or interpretation.
Coming to the book under review, we find excellent reviews of films he has seen in 1979 in the Yarl Cinema Circle showings in Yaalpaanam.
He has involved himself actively in the above circle and the films unit of the Yaalpaanam University. Bharaneetharan, editor of a promising literary journal called Jeevnathy invited and encouraged him to write for his magazine.
From the South in Lanka, Anoma Rajakaruna, the active promoter of film and the like, patronized Yesurasa as a resource person. Her Agenda 14 organized a Short Film Festival in Colombo in 2015. There were Sinhala and Thamil films were shown. In his first article, Yesurasa gives a vivid account of the festival. I came to know many things from his review of his Short Films.
Next, the author reviews of many unknown films to me like A Cruel Romance (Russian) by Elder Riazanov. A long essay that is illuminating.
Using the film script writing technique, he brilliantly analyzes a Czechoslovak film called Romeo, Juliet and Darkness
In the same way, he reviews Stoning of Soraya by Craze Nowrasteh,
La Terra Trema  Italian film by Luciano Visconti adapted from Geovanni Vegas novel-Under the House by Melder Tree,
Party by Govind Nihalani,
A Generation by Andre Wadia,
Lemon Tree by Eran Riklis and finally
The Bridge by Barnhart Vici.
Scenes from the films in black and white are also an added use.
All the above films I havent seen yet. Thanks to Yesurasaa for making me visualize and enjoy the film. His film reviews are novel to film appreciation as he adapts the style of the scriptwriters methodically bringing out minute details and nuances in the film.

So, you want to start-up and develop a small business  Part 09
Your mission is impossible unless you have strategic plans
Have you ever been involved in a business that never seems to accomplish very much Regardless of how hard you work, you just go in circles. The problem may be that you have not decided where you want to go and have not created a roadmap of how to get there. From the perspective of acompany, the problem may be that you are not focusing on what you want to achieve and how you will achieve it.
The first is a statement of vision. It provides a destination for the company. Next is a statement of mission. This is a guiding light of how to get to the destination. These are critical statements for the company and the individuals who run the company.
In short, vision is the big mental picture of what you want to achieve. Mission is the general statement of how you will achieve the vision.
For example, your vision may be to have a successful family grocery business. Your Mission maybe to provide hygienic and high-quality grocery products to the nation, both wholesale and retail.
As you can see, there is a close relationship between the vision and mission. As the vision statement is a static mental picture of what you want to achieve, the mission statement is a dynamic process of how the vision will be accomplished.
Let us check few vision statements of leading global organisations.
l To be the most creative organisation in the world. BBC
l To use our unlimited passion for technology, content and services to deliver ground-breaking new excitement and entertainment. - SONY
l To provide access to the worlds information in one click. - GOOGLE
l To remain the most authentic, connected, and distinctive brand. - NIKE
In this instalment, we will give emphasis to mission statement as it is the dynamic process.
A good mission statement is a written, easy-to-remember sentence, a short list of bullet points, or a paragraph illustrating your businesss goals and purpose in life. Or, in other words, its what makes your company special. Mission statements come in many sizes, shapes, and forms, but they all have one common purpose: to guide you and your employees in making the critical decisions that affect your companys direction.
Additionally, your mission statement should identify your company to outsiders - your customers, your vendors, the media, and others. To give you an idea of how well-developed mission statements identify the businesses behind them, let us give you few of them.
l To enrich peoples lives with programmes and services that inform, educate and entertain. BBC.
l To be a company that inspires and fulfils your curiosity. Sony.
l To organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful. Google.
l Bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. (If you have a body, you are an athlete.)
Writing your mission statement
The question you should answer when creating your mission statement is, What solution do I provide, and what must I do to make sure that the solution I provide is consistently delivered
So, how should your mission statement read Let us help you. For example: If you were going to open a new bookstore, would your mission statement state to sell books or to increase the educational and enjoyment levels of customers
If you were going to start a contracting business, would your mission statement read to build houses or to provide affordable building solutions for customers
If you were planning to start a service and repair shop to handle household plumbing and electricity, would your mission statement be to handle plumbing and electricity issues in your home or to provide houseowners with solutions to their plumbing and electricity problems and maintaining them life-long trouble free
Youd choose the second option. Notice the common inference in all three of these mission statements to the key word solutions. Give yourself plenty of room to grow within your niche when you develop your businesss mission statement.
For instance, when a bookstore owner defines the mission behind her business as education and enjoyment, she leaves open the option to sell DVDs rather than just books. When a contractor defines his purpose to provide building solutions, he has the option to build garages, barns, and outbuildings, in addition to homes.
Keeping your mission in peoples minds
For your mission statement to be effective, it should be readily accessible to your customers, employees, and all those who come into contact with your business. So, after your company is up and running, be sure to display your mission statement in many places: On the walls and bulletin boards in the most visible places in your business: Posting your mission statement in such visible places serves as a constant reminder to you, your employees, and your customers of what your business is all about.
It should be in the executive summary section of your business plan. Investors and other important outsiders are often busy and appreciate reading the highlights of your plan first and then selectively delving into the details as they feel necessary.
It should also be on the first page of your employee manual, if your business is large enough to warrant a manual. This prominent placement demonstrates to employees what their number one concern should be when they come to work each day. On every document your company generates, including but not limited to stationery, faxes, newsletters, and e-mails: This may seem like overkill, but it helps everyone to internalize the companys purpose.
Strategies and goals
Once you have created statements of vision and mission, you can then develop the strategies, goals, objectives and action plans needed to activate your mission and achieve your vision.
Strategies  A strategy is a statement of how you are going to achieve something. More specifically, a strategy is a unique approach of how you will use your mission to achieve your vision. Strategies are critical to the success of a company because this is where you begin outlining a plan for doing something. The more unique the company, the more creative and innovative you need to be in crafting your strategies.
Goals  A goal is a general statement of what you want to achieve. More specifically, a goal is a milestone(s) in the process of implementing a strategy. Examples of business goals are: increase profit margin, increase efficiency, capture a bigger market share, provide better customer service, improve employee training.
Be sure the goals are focused on the important aspects of implementing the strategy. Be careful not to set too many goals or you may run the risk of losing focus. Also, design your goals so that they dont contradict and interfere with each other.
A goal should meet the following criteria: (a) Understandable: Is it stated simply and easy to understand (b) Suitable: Does it assist in implementing a strategy of how the mission will achieve the vision (c) Acceptable: Does it fit with the values of the company and its members/employees (d) Flexible: Can it be adapted and changed as needed
Objectives
An objective turns a goals general statement of what is to be accomplished into a specific, quantifiable, time-sensitive statement of what is going to be achieved and when it will be achieved. Examples of business objectives are: (a) Earn at least a 20 percent after-tax rate of return on our investment during the next fiscal year. (2) Increase market share by 10 percent over the next three years. (3) Lower operating costs by 15 percent over the next two years through improvement in the efficiency of the management and product process. (4) Reduce the call-back time of customer inquiries and questions to no more than four hours.
Action Plans  These plans are statements of specific actions or activities that will be used to achieve a goal within the constraints of the objective. An example of an action plan:
Goal  improve skills of shames people
Objective  Conduct two training programs in the next six months
Action  Hire a professional trainer.
Action plans are converted to a full blown and detailed business plan where goals and objectives are also included. We will discuss it next week.

Zimbabwe thrash Bangladesh  for long-awaited Test win
Sylhet, Tuesday: Brandon Mavuta and Sikandar Raza shared seven wickets between them as Zimbabwe recorded their first Test win in five years with a thumping 151-run victory over Bangladesh on Tuesday.
Debutant leg-spinner Mavuta claimed 4-21 and off-spinner Razas 3-41 as hosts Bangladesh were left chasing 321 runs on the fourth day in the northeastern city of Sylhet.
Wellington Masakadza, another debutant, also shone with two wickets as Zimbabwe made quick work of Bangladeshs lower order, dismissing the hosts for 169.
Left-arm spinner Maskadza took the final wicket of the innings, sending Ariful Haque for 38 as Zimbabwe notched their first Test win since beating Pakistan in Harare in 2013.
It is also the first time Zimbabwe has clinched an away Test victory since beating Bangladesh in Chittagong 17 years ago in 2001.
I am ecstatic. I thought the guys went out and worked really hard to apply themselves, Zimbabwe captain Hamilton Masakadza said in the post match presentation ceremony. Zimbabwe sensed a win once Raza claimed three vital wickets in the opening session to reduce Bangladeshs innings to half.
Kyle Jarvis and Mavuta joined the act with Raza in the morning as they chipped in with a wicket apiece to leave Bangladesh 111-5 at the break.
Bangladesh resumed play on 26-0 but within half-an-hour had lost their first wicket, with others following quickly.
Play started 30 minutes early to make up for the lost time after bad light brought a premature end to day three, with Bangladesh still needing 295 runs on a wearing pitch.
The home side -- whose best run chase was 217-6 against the West Indies in 2009 -- started to throw wickets once Raza reviewed a legbefore appeal against opener Liton Das.
The umpire gave Liton not out but a TV replay indicated the ball would have hit the stump after pitching outside off -- ending Litons innings on 23.
One down, Mominul Haque dragged a Jarvis delivery onto his stumps for nine before Raza bowled Imrul Kayes for 43 to leave Bangladesh at 83-3. AFP
