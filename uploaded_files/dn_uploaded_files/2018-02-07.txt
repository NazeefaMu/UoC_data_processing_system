Remove civic rights of those convicted - JVP
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) agrees that a person who is convicted of corruption charges should be banned for life from contesting at a Presidential election or a General election, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in Parliament yesterday.
He said that as the Bond Commission report recommends that the law should be amended preventing those convicted of corruption contesting at the Presidential Election or a General Election although the existing law prevents them only for seven years. We agree that the law should be amended since it is a flaw, MP Dissanayake said.
He made this observation joining the adjournment debate on the Bond Commission report and on the Presidential Commission report on Serious Crimes and Abuse of Power (PRECIFAC) moved by Prime Minister Ranil Wickramesinghe.
MP Dissanayake also pointed out that Parliament is not an organ that sentences people, and that the JVP objects to punishing someone by depriving him of his civic rights based on a political decision.
MP Dissanayake commencing the speech stated that the Premier did not speak of the real gravity of the Treasury Bond issue. He added that the previous government took over SriLankan Airlines and the loss from this is Rs 125 billion, cancellation of the four aircraft incurred a loss of Rs 18 billion. Since the previous regime bought treasury bonds in Greece, the loss incurred was Rs 8 billion, MP Dissanayake said. The Avant Garde loss is Rs 11 billion.
He also said that although the Good Governance government came to power to punish corrupt politicians, it delayed the investigations, and later protected them and attempted to share the misused money during the previous regime. Later the members of this government too engaged in corruption through this Bond issue.
He also said that the Commission report includes 34 frauds.He also said that former Minister Basil Rajapaksa had created a loss of Rs 1,100 million through his domestic air travel and for additional vehicles. During that period, money had been granted to allies of politicians indirectly. He added that the expenditure for the opening and water filling ceremony of the Hambantota Port was Rs 170 million.These should be changed.
He added that the loss incurred by the ITN through the advertisements during the previous regime at the Presidential Election was Rs 230 million and the sixth respondent of it is former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.Theres a dialogue to remove his civic rights. It should be done through proper legal channels and not based on a political decision.

Resolve against corruption bearing fruit - Ravi
A new political culture should be established and the efforts of the Unity Government is beginning to bear fruit, UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake said.
He said he wholeheartedly agrees with the Presidents sentiments expressed during his Independence Day speech that, the fight against corruption is the self-defence of a nation.
Strengthening the attitude for anti-corruption and implementing it is the self-defence of the nation to ensure its progress.
MP Karunanayake expressed these views during the parliamentary debate on the Bond Commission report and the PRECIFAC report in parliament yesterday.
He expressed satisfaction at the implementation of the fundamentals of good governance. During the past, corruption, wastefulness and brutality were the norms accepted in society.
The reason economic development could not be achieved in the country was due to the petty political agendas of a few. However, we laid the foundation needed in establishing good governance on January 8, 2015. But we must prove our good intentions through our deeds, he added.
He urged everyone to join in establishing true good governance in the country sans petty political desires.
Karunanayake said today, those who dont even know how many zeros are there in a million or billion are talking about the losses in the bond issue. The bond issue is not just an issue of the previous government or this one, but corruption has become a culture in this country, he said adding that it is regretful that this issue is hampering the progress of the country and stagnating it. Instead he said what we need today is a constructive political approach.
He went on to explain how the Bond issue incident had affected him as a parliamentarian and an individual. During the recent past there were elements who were trying to portray me as the biggest sinner and culprit. This sinister move is still taking place. But no matter how much mudslinging or humiliation I am made to undergo, I can still be content with the fact that the efforts we made to establish good governance in this country is bearing fruit, he said.

Solanra sole agent for  Jurawatt Solar panels
Solanra has met their target of contributing to the national electricity grid with 1000 kilo watts power within one year using German made Jurawatt solar panels.
Solanra commissioned in 2012 is the sole agent in Sri Lanka for Jurawatt solar panels, worlds number one German solar panel for tropical countries and geographical locations with desserts.
Solanra recently held a felicitation ceremony at Grand Monarch hotel, Thalawatugoda to appreciate its loyal customers towards the object of adding 1000 kilowatts electricity to the national grid before end of 2017. The event was graced by Solanra Companys CEO Kingsley Jayawardene, who is a senior electrical engineer and an experienced consultant in renewable energy for European countries.
Each Jurawatt solar panel installed by the Solanra has a 35 year warranty. These solar panels are the most suited ones for extreme climatic and geographical conditions that prevail in Sri Lanka.
Jurawatt solar panels have many unique attributes that other solar panels being used in the country do not have. Its core competency is it has 125 centigrade Maximum Absorb Temperature. Usually in Sri Lanka absorbed solar panels temperature increasesabove 80 centigrade. Solar panels with the capacity to absorb highertemperature fail in functioning as a result and reduce their lifetime by years.
In addition, the Austrian made Fronius Inverter used with Juarawatt solar panels has the ability to generate power even at a time when there is very little sunlight.
It generates power from 6am to 6pm. Thus it is super flex design and perfect answer to irregularly shaped or different roof orientations and Fronius inverter has WLAN or Ethernet internet connection to monitor remotely..
Jurawatt solar panel also has self-cleaning mechanism to clean bird droppings and dust plus the strength to safeguard its components against animals like monkeys that intrude. All components are made in Germany and the frame around the solar panel is made with special Aluminium alloy material with a warranty. In addition Jurawatt panels generate 30 percent more power when compared with common solar panels in the market.
Solanra Managing Director, Shirley Jayawardene, commented, Jurawatt solar panel sold by our company is the best product for tropical countries and it is already endorsed by our loyal customers and service providers who are being felicitated today.
Common solar panels in the marketplace could absorb only a temperature of 85 centigrade. But in many seasons we experience temperature rising to greater levels.

SpaceX launches Falcon Heavy, the world's most powerful rocket

The pioneering rocket firm just pulled off the unexpected, and carried out what appears to be a seamless first-ever launch of its massive new rocket, called Falcon Heavy.
That makes SpaceX, the game-changing company helmed by billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the owner of the world's most powerful operational rocket.
Falcon Heavy took flight Tuesday around 3:45 pm ET from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
"I'm still trying to absorb everything that happened because it's still kind of surreal to me," Musk told reporters after the launch.
Thousands of onlookers in Florida could be heard cheering on the company's livestream, which was viewed by about 3 million people.
In the run up to launch, it wasn't at all clear that the rocket would work.
"People [came] from all around the world to see what will either be a great rocket launch or the best fireworks display they've ever seen," Musk said.
The rocket's smooth takeoff wasn't the only stunning thing about this launch.
In a never-before-seen feat, SpaceX also managed to guide at least two of the Falcon Heavy's first-stage rocket boosters to land upright back on Earth. They cut back through the Earth's atmosphere and landed in unison at a Kennedy Space Center landing pad.
"That was probably the most exciting thing I've ever seen -- literally ever," Musk said.
The third booster was supposed to land on a sea-faring platform called a droneship -- but just as it was about to land, the livestream cut out. Musk confirmed after the launch that the booster made a crashed.
On board the rocket that's now headed deeper into space is Musk's personalTesla(TSLA) roadster. At the wheel is a dummy dressed in a spacesuit. Musk said in December the car would play David Bowie's "Space Oddity" on repeat.Camerason board the car show it cruising by Earth, which appears as a big blue orb in the background. Musk plans to send the car into orbit around the sun.
He announced last year he planned to put his car on the inaugural Falcon Heavy flight. When asked on Twitter why he wanted to throw away a $100,000 vehicle, he replied, "I love the thought of a car drifting apparently endlessly through space and perhaps being discovered by an alien race millions of years in the future."
Tuesday's success marked a huge step forward for a company that's already managed to shake up the rocket industry with its groundbreaking technology.
The company made the world take notice when it proved it can safely return first-stage rocket boosters to Earth with its Falcon 9 rocket, which the company has used for more than 40 missions dating back to 2012.
Those rockets have a single first-stage booster, and SpaceX has safely recaptured them after 21 Falcon 9 launches.
Now, SpaceX routinely puts used boosters back to work. In fact, the inaugural Falcon Heavy flight actually used two pre-flown Falcon 9 boosters (the center booster was new.)
Reusing hardware is part of SpaceX's plan to drive down the cost of launches.
Before SpaceX came along, companies just discarded rockets after each mission.
Note the Falcon Heavy is notthe most powerful rocket in history. That honor belongs to NASA's Saturn V rocket, which was used for the Apollo moon landings and was retired in the 1970s.

Trumps State of the Union speech causes global stir
The worlds self-proclaimed leader of democracy and global order may have, last week, sounded alarmingly belligerent to the rest of the world community and heartlessly self-centred as well. But if America is sounding more and more aggressive, in East Asia, the two Korean republics are busy, with much global support, making peace. The latest effort is the exercise in unified participation in this years biggest world sporting event  the 2018 Winter Olympics.
And, in West Asia, the European Union has swiftly stepped in to support the Palestinian government after Washington summarily cancelled its financial support for Palestine. Turkey, however, is still busy crushing Syrian Kurdish rebel forces in small parts of war-torn Syria where those rebel groups, with US support, helped vanquish the remnants of the Islamic State movement.
It was Russian military support to its ally, the Assad-led Baathist Party dictatorship in Syria, that was the main factor that led to the elimination of the IS in Syria territory. Russia, too, is not too unhappy at the weakening of the Syrian Kurds, because the US-supported Kurds would have contributed to American manoeuvring to carve up Syria and destroy the powerful Arab nation it once was.
Even as US President Donald Trump blared out a war-like and xenophobic State of the Union (SOTU) speech to the joint session of the US House of Representatives and Senate last Tuesday, the US Congress was clearly polarised on partisan lines in their response to this annual presidential address, Trumps very first. The opposition Democratic Partys women legislators all wore black in protest against Trumps personal, questionable, record on gender issues. And, as Republicans frequently stood to applaud their Presidents statements, the Democrats remained seated with stony faces.
Of course, many commentators across political lines and across the world, praised Trump for sticking to his script and not wandering off the rails with ad lib remarks that are too often racist, sexist, or crudely abusive of whole countries, including Americas principal allies. At the same time, the script, soberly delivered by a usually volatile President, articulated a vision that was implicitly (White) racially biased and elitist in its description of American socio-economic realities, promised more socially discriminating reform and, ignored urgent global issues such as Climate Change, and armed conflict hotspots.
Iranian leaders said his speech exposed his ignorance of world issues. Chinese media commentators called it belligerent and criticised what they said was Americas zero-sum-game approach to global politics.
State of the Union speech
A possibly significant new development in the US was the Democratic Partys choice for the traditional Opposition response to the State of the Union speech  young Democratic member of the US House of Representatives, Joe Kennedy, a grand nephew of the legendary President John Kennedy. US commentators praised Joe Kennedys speech delivered to a small town gathering in his home state of Massachusetts.
His pick for this role is seen by some commentators as indicating that the Democratic Party may have Kennedy also in mind for the 2020 US presidential race. His refreshing youthfulness, his socially progressive and intellectually refined approach as well as his star power as a scion of Americas most prominent political family, provides Kennedy with very useful attributes for presidential candidacy.
However, in terms of gaining political prominence and institutional experience, Kennedy has a long way more to go. Apparently, in order to gain experience, Kennedy is considering entering either a US Senate or state governorship race first. Perhaps, his pick for the SOTU response is his partys way of boosting him. From the sound bite I heard of his speech, Kennedy certainly shows talent. His speech is available on the Web.
Readers are encouraged to read the full SOTU speech on the internet available in numerous websites. The tone and content of the American Presidents speech so echoes the xenophobic belligerence  smoothly delivered  expressed by our own immediate past governmental leadership that we are reminded of what we, Sri Lankans, went through in the recent decade.
Certainly, the peoples of countries that have undergone autocracy, racism and abuse of power will more easily discern the current trajectory of American governance and political life than those affluent nations who have only known comfortable liberal democracy and lavish social welfare. We have heard and seen all this in our own country already. In fact, many of us knew what the American people were in for when we realised, in 2016, that they were electorally opting for a very un-intelligent, dirtily playboy, overtly unscrupulous, businessman as their Head of State.
Truly, Democratic presidential candidate (and former US Secretary of State) Hillary Clinton was very sharply accurate when, in a 2016 election campaign speech, she described the emerging core of Trump political mass support as a basket of deplorables. In fact, the growing list of his crude, constitutionally dangerous, interventions to undermine the intensive investigation by his own specialised counter-espionage and subversion agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), only affirms that the President himself is likely the chief of deplorables!
Of course, it was stupidly  and arrogantly  tactless of Hillary Clinton to have made that remark about deplorables from her own election platform. It simply affirmed her intellectual aloofness from that smallish  but electorally significant  section of the US population of mostly low education and low income who form the core of Trumps constituency.
As far as this writer is concerned, who the American people elect for governance is primarily their problem, just as it is for our voters.
Trump under investigation
What continues to be sensational news is that the head of worlds most powerful liberal democracy, famed for its superpower achievements and sheer geo-political might, is increasingly betraying behaviour of someone who is guilty of at least serious misdemeanours, if not grave crimes.
Even as he delivered his presidential address, Trump is under investigation by his own top counter-espionage and crime agency as well as three most powerful Congress oversight committees for possible treasonous conspiracy with his countys worst rival, Russia, and may also be abusing his powers by attempting to obstruct the federal probes into this possible conspiracy.
The fact that already, even before Donald Trump was elected or even made presidential candidate, most of Americas top security agencies had concluded that Russia was covertly intervening in US internet social media and even hacking into US election systems in attempts to prevent the election of the more accomplished  and therefore more dangerous  Hillary Clinton.
Unfortunately for the worlds sole - but declining - super-power, the flurry of forceful interventions against top federal agencies as well as violations of strict political norms within the US Congress and Government itself, are not just the actions of one person, the President. Rather, his own ruling Republican Party seems to be as active in undermining, in numerous ways  public maligning being the least  both top public officials as well as their countrys vital security and justice agencies!
The Republican have their own, ultra-elitist agenda for their country: an unleashing of a more neo-liberal capitalism, an arms build-up mainly to fill the pockets of the military-industrial complex, and, a socially and ecologically inconsiderate de-regulation regime ostensibly to revitalise a sluggish economy.
This agenda is already being implemented with the ecological and social damage to be subsequently experienced by America.
How much serious damage a Republican presidency will do to the larger world depends on how much the Republican politicians can get an ignorant President to sign off on. It may also depend on how much that President remains loyal to his own country and not to any foreign entities that may have earlier trapped or compromised him either in terms of financial dealings and indebtedness or as a collaborator in political subversion.
2018 is likely to be a year of political upheaval in the United States both because of the Trump conspiracy investigation and its related attempts to obstruct justice and also because of Novembers mid-term congressional elections.

The arrest of Perpetual Treasuries owner Arjun Aloysius and CEO Kasun Palisena by the CID is a huge step forward as we enforce the law and stamp down on bribery and corruption in Sri Lanka.
We are committed to good governance.This is central to our plan to build economic strength that will bring benefits to people.

Under this government, corruption will be dealt with within the full extent of the law. We have worked hard to turn this economy around and the UNP will not stand by, while our hard work is undermined by those who seek to take what is not theirs.
The UNP is strengthening our courts and forcing through reforms that will enable us to properly prosecute those under the previous government that stand guilty of corruption and bring a new level of transparency to Sri Lanka, that will give people confidence in their government and ensure that their government is held fully accountable. This is truly a new era in good governance for our country," the statement said.

When you have too much to do
You have a to-do list that scrolls on for days. You are managing multiple projects, getting lots of email and messages on different messaging systems, managing finances and personal health habits and so much more.
It all keeps piling up, and it can feel overwhelming.
How do you keep up with it all How do you find focus and peace and get stuff accomplished when you have too much on your plate
Triage
Whether youre just starting your day, or youre in the middle of the chaos and just need to find some sanity  the first step is to get into triage mode.
Triage, as you probably know, is sorting through the chaos to prioritize: what needs to be done now, what needs to be done today, what needs to be done this week, and what can wait Youre looking at urgency, but also whats meaningful and important.
Heres what you might do:
Pick out the things that need to be done today. Start a Short List for things youre going to do today. That might be important tasks for big projects, urgent tasks that could result in damage if you dont act, smaller admin tasks that you really should take care of today, and responding to important messages. I would recommend being ruthless and cutting out as much as you can, having just 5 things on your plate if thats at all possible. Not everything needs to be done today, and not every email needs to be responded to.
Push some things to tomorrow and the rest of the week. If you have deadlines that can be pushed back (or renegotiated), do that. Spread the work out over the week, even into next week. What needs to be done tomorrow What can wait a day or two longer
Eliminate what you can. That might mean just not replying to some messages that arent that important and dont really require a reply. It might mean telling some people that you cant take on this project after all, or that you need to get out of the commitment that you said youd do. Yes, this is uncomfortable. For now, just put them on a list called, To Not Do, and plan to figure out how to get out of them later.
Focus on One Thing
With a lot on your plate, its hard to pick one thing to focus on. But thats exactly what Im going to ask you to do.
Pick one thing, and give it your focus. Yes, there are a lot of other things you can focus on. Yes, theyre stressing you out and making it hard to focus. But think about it this way: if you allow it all to be in your head all the time, that will always be your mode of being. Youll always be thinking about everything, stressing out about it all, with a frazzled mind  unless you start shifting.
Pick something to focus on. Look at the triaged list from the first section  if you have 5-6 things on this Short List, you can assess whether theres any super urgent, time-sensitive things you need to take care of. If there are, pick one of them. If not, pick the most important one  probably the one you have been putting off doing.
Clear everything else away. Just for a little bit. Close all browser tabs, turn off notifications, close open applications, put your phone away.
Put that one task before you, and allow yourself to be with it completely. Pour yourself into it. Think of it as a practice, of letting go (of everything else), of focus, of radical simplicity.
When youre done (or after 15-20 minutes have gone by at least), you can switch to something else. But dont allow yourself to switch until then.
By closing off all exits, by choosing one thing, by giving yourself completely to that thing  youre now in a different mode that isnt so stressful or spread thin. Youve started a shift that will lead to focus and sanity.
Schedule time to simplify
Remember the To Not Do list above Schedule some time this week to start reducing your projects, saying no to people, getting out of commitments, crossing stuff off your task list  so that you can have some sanity back.
There are lots of little things that youve said yes to that you probably shouldnt have. Thats why youre overloaded. Protect your more important work, and your time off, and your peace of mind, by saying no to things that arent as important.
Schedule the time to simplify  you dont have to do it today, but sometime soon  and you can then not have to worry about the things on your To Not Do list until then.
Practice Mindful Focus
Go through the rest of the day with an attitude of mindful focus. That means that you are doing one thing at a time, being as present as you can, switching as little as you can.
Think of it as a settling of the mind. A new mode of being. A mindfulness practice (which means you wont be perfect at it).
As you practice mindful focus, youll learn to practice doing things with an open heart, with curiosity and gratitude, and even joy. Try these one at a time as you get to do each task on your Short List.
Youll find that youre not so overloaded, but that each task is just perfect for that moment. And thats a completely new relationship with the work that you do, and a new relationship with life. - Zen Habits

The Members of the Moors Islamic Cultural Home along with the entire Muslim Community expressed their deepest sympathies on the sudden demise of one of the most revered Buddhist prelates Ven. Professor Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera, Vice Chancellor of Sri Jayewardenapura University and the Viharadhikari of Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya, the Moors Islamic Cultural Home stated in a message of condolence.
The message added: The Late Thera was well known for his leadership qualities, especially in the struggles concerning the nation and Buddhism and also for his wholehearted support in creating harmony amongst all the other communities in Sri Lanka.
Professor Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thero, the pioneer of the National Maha Sangha Council was a peace activist and initiated many programmes to reconcile the differences among the people of the country and helped them to live together in harmony as Sri Lankans.
The Venerable Thera was a well known educationist and an erudite speaker. He lived an exemplary life by treating everyone, irrespective of their religion or ethnicity, with love and kindness. He was also a highly acclaimed academic and his services towards language, art and literature will be remembered by the grateful Sri Lankans for a very long time.
The vacuum created by the demise of Ven. Wimalarathana Thera is hard to be filled and it will be felt not only by the Buddhists of this country but also to others including the Muslims of Sri Lanka and we too would miss him a lot.

PM tells other political parties
Act against corrupt members
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday challenged all other political parties to investigate into and take action against corrupt members in their fold.
Whilst members of other political parties just speak of corruption and fraud, the United National Party, took steps to investigate into members with alleged charges of corruption and malpractice, said the Prime Minister as he asked other parties to follow suit.
The Prime Minister was speaking at a political meeting in Matale to promote UNP candidates contesting for the Local Government elections there.
We have always stood against corruption. If our members have been found guilty of such practices, we ask them to leave. But, in other parties, even if they have thieves and corrupt politicians among them, no action is taken. They shout in Parliament. They scold the UNP. But it is only the UNP which cleans its party. There is no point in scolding the UNP when they do not clean up their own party, said Prime Minister Wickremesinghe further.
I ask them, do they have the courage to clean up their own party, he added.

AG raises objections over Jaliyas  writ petition
Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya yesterday raised preliminary objections regarding a writ petition filed by former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya who challenged the Foreign Affairs Ministrys decision to waive his diplomatic immunity.
Filing a writ petition in the Court of Appeal, Jaliya Wickramasuriya alleged that the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued a letter informing US authorities that diplomatic immunity of former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the US Jaliya Wickramasuriya had been removed.
The petitioner is seeking a writ order to quash the Ministry Secretarys decision to issue a letter waiving his diplomatic immunity contrary to the laws, regulations and conventions.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda appearing for the Attorney General informed Court of Appeal that the petition cannot be maintained since Court of Appeal does not have a jurisdiction to hear the application.
ASG Kodagoda contended that the powers relating to the diplomatic affairs are vested with the President and thereby this application should have heard before Supreme Court.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appeared on behalf of the petitioner. The petition is to be taken up for support on February 19.
At a previous occasion, the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued an open warrant for the arrest of Jaliya Wickramasuriya for his failure to appear before Court.
The FCID had filed a B report in the Fort Magistrates Court against Jaliya Wickramasuriya for allegedly misappropriating USD 330,000 out of USD 6.6 million allocated for purchasing a building for Sri Lankan Embassy in US.
The FCID alleged that the suspect had misappropriated the concerned amount committed during the purchase of a building to house the Sri Lankan embassy at 3025, White Haven Street, Washington. The former ambassador had remitted this money to Sri Lanka. The former Ambassador is a close relative of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

ANDREA  MANTEGNAS  DEAD CHRIST
ASH WEDNESDAY which is forty days and forty nights of repentance to all Christians is around the corner. With its arrival our conscience is stirred as we all watch the agony of Jesus Christ as depicted by many masters of the past, especially by Andrea Mantegna. They impact all of us more than spiritual leaders do during repentance.
Helpless, hopeless devastated and at the mercy of all us sinners, THE DEAD CHRIST after he was lowered from the cross dramatically captured this iconic painter. Every Christian who views this painting, coil inside in remorse and guilt, shocked with repentance, is recorded that many such people kneel before this painting and rise with tears in their eyes. This extra ordinary painting depicts the familiar theory, THE LAMENTATION over Body of Christ with startling perspective and a harrowing sense of pathos.
Swollen contours
Being one of the most outstanding paintings during his period, the size and composition of the picture suggest a slab in a morgue because the figure of Jesus Christ foreshortened to such an extent, it appears deformed but in fact, matches the swollen contours of a body gripped in death.
This use of virtuoso illusionary effects and influenced a number of Renaissance artists. Mantegna used great extent of different effects and illustrated perspectives especially when he was commissioned by the church to do spiritual paintings.
Heralded as a work of unsurpassed genius, THE DEAD CHRIST by Renaissance master, Andrea Mantegna was immediately recognized as a groundbreaking impacted influence not only among Catholics but the world at large. The painting rates one among the top two paintings voted annually in a list of fifty worldwide.
A stickler for perfection, all his other reflections on Christ, paled before THE DEAD CHRIST. His innovative devices and bold compositions both of which are defining features without which precedence predicted elements of 16th century.
Tortured form
Taking a closer look at this masterpiece, Mantegna's painting is a masterful rendition of death in its most realistic and tortured form; the misery and cold despair of the painting sharpened by its restrictive tonality palette. This is really relentless. Look at his wrinkled feet, punctured with nail holes, are the feet of a real man which is biting naturalism that deepens pathos in the image. From the feet to the eyes are directed towards the hands, again punctured and curled up in the agony of death but strangely no blood smears or stains.
Yet, it is the face of the dead Christ that is perhaps most compelling and profoundly and utterly sad. There is a pillow like object placed under the upper part of the body painted in the same colouring that merge into his shoulders, thus making the torso look heavy and large. The painting has to be studied with intensity to separate the body from where he is placed upon. Even the linen placed on, is draped rather than wrapped. The fingers droop rather than placed.
The nails piercing on the body is so real-looking, even the skin around them are torn. The angle from which the painter has captured the agony of the dying Christ is so real, it brings tears to every Christian eye.
Mantegna was recognized as a great artist even during his prolific career and remains an artist who permanently enriched Western culture. He was one of the painters that can be credited to the development of artistic philosophy of Michelangelo.
Aesthetic harmony
Very inspirational and talented among the leading artists of modern history was not only prodigious but talented in many other artistic heritage and classical sources. The aesthetic harmony and technical competence made him the great artist he was.
Andrea Mantegna born in 1431 fourteen years after the Start of the Reformation in 1517 were raised in a good Christian family who trusted in the Lord. It was from this background that his inspiration to paint Jesus and his disciples emerged the magnificently eclectic and emotive Renaissance spread out the story of Jesus Christ in all his paintings with THE DEAD CHRIST leading them all. He also looked to the antiquity and classical precedence in the depiction of naturalistic details that made THE DEAD CHRIST the most important and accepted painting the world ever saw.
Done in oil on canvas, it is 66 x 81 cm. and held at Pinacteca di Bera in Milan. Andrea Mantegna was born in Isola de Cartura, near Padua in 1431 and died in Mantua in 1506 after an illustrious career, very often commissioned by the Church; he left behind an artistic legacy in spirituality that few masters could have achieved.

## Title: From Anna Akhmatova with love

From Anna Akhmatova with love
Poetry commences with delight and ends in wisdom, said the great American poet Robert Frost in one of his celebrated presentations titled as Meditative Monologue. I found or rather discovered the essence of the ideology on re-reading the poems of Anna Akhmatova (1889  1966), the Russian poetess as translated into English by the American critic and poetess Lyn Coffin. These selections and translations appeared as far back as 1974 but came to be reprinted in 1983, with an introduction by Joseph Brodsky, a friend of Akhmatova in her later years.
He states that ever since her death, Anna Akhmatova has been recognised as the greatest modern Russian poet. Though it is stated that poetry is what is lost in the translation process, I found that Akhmatova possesses the richness of the vision common to the Occident as well as the Orient. Most of the poems are visionary.
For example, she takes the widely accepted view of the belief in the blessings as enchanting gifts of higher beings like gods and goddesses but twists the same into a plane beyond the mundane state of belief. In this direction, she has written several poems on the subject of The Muse, the goddess who empowers the aesthetics of humans. This is how she recreates her plane of creative thinking.
When at night I await the beloved guest
Life seems to hang by thread,
What is youth, I demand of the room.
What is honour, freedom the rest
In the presence of her, who holds the flute in her hand But now she is here
Tossing aside the veil,
She considers me.
Are you the one who came to Dante who dictated the pages of Hell to him
I ask her.
She replies: I am.
Most of the poetic creations of Akhmatova depict sights of a deep sense of social change via a new form of conscience linked to spiritualism and political commitment. What she desires to bring about a change in the social progress devoid of violence, harm and discrimination. As such, some poetic visions embrace a sense of a religious prayer that could lead to an inner metamorphosis. I like the following lines as an example written in 1915 the short poem is titled Prayer:
Give me illness for years an end,
Shortness of breath, insomnia and fever,
Take away my child and friend,
The gift of song, my last believer,
I pray according to my rite
After many wearisome days
That the story cloud over Russia might
Turn white and bask in a glory of rays.
Perhaps as Broadsky in his preface underlines, Akhmatova may have led to the change in mass conscience when reading in the original Russian. Perhaps as he states, Akhmatova belongs to the category of poets who have neither genealogy nor discernible development.
She is the kind of poet that simply happens to hypnotise and arrives into the world with an already established diction power of expression.
Akhmatova expressed feelings of identity linked to a wide spectrum of experiences. They include some of the profiles like Alexander Pushkin, Boris Pasternak and Mikhail Bulgakov. Age-old creators like Dante (of Divine Comedy fame) too emerge to widen the horizons.
Some of the shortest poems resemble more to thought streams that capture moments of illumination. One good example is as follows. The poem has no title.
When a person dies
His portraits change.
His eyes see differently and his mouth
Smiles different smiles
I realised this
When I came back from the funeral of a poet
And I have verified my insight
Many times since then.
Akhmatova sees nature as a living entity. Her poems cannot be classed as mere descriptions of nature, instead of a life-giving force, which enables the humans to reconsider the stance of existence. She writes the following lines in the poem titled as The Willow.
I grew up where all was
Patterned and silent
In the cool nursery of the age,
Itself young.
I didnt like human words
Spoken or sung.
But I understood what the wind meant.
As Broadsky passes a verdict on her poetic sensibility, she was while eliminating the song of propagandism, desired a social revolution in her motherland via her creations. Furthermore, her versifications gravitated to the vernacular, to the idiom of the folk song, the pulse of the people, whose grief she wanted to share and express as a need of the time.
The love poems written by Akhmatova are neither romantic nor metaphysical in structure. They embrace the sense of ecstasy and delight giving meaning to reality. As Broadsky notes, they had a terrific novelistic quality echoing the worth of living and loving each other. Akhmatova touched an innocence, love, faith, history, fatigue, cynicism, inspiration, guilt, punishment and decadence as her heartfelt subject areas. The language of love is clearly the lingua franca. Its vocabulary absorbs all the other tongues.

Asia markets join global stock plunge
Asian markets plunged on Tuesday as investors dumped stocks following heavy falls in the US in anticipation of higher interest rates.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index sank 6.1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 4.5%.
It comes after the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst drop in more than six years on Monday.
A strengthening global economy and healthy corporate earnings had spurred world markets to record highs.
But the sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates faster than expected.
"Economic news from the US has been stronger than anticipated," said David Kuo, chief executive of financial services advisory Motley Fool.
"So, perversely, the market correction has been caused by positive economic news."
Markets in Asia typically follow the lead from the US. Elsewhere in the region, South Korea's Kospi index was down 2.6%, India's Sensex index sank 3.6%, and Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 gave up 3%.
US stock futures were pointing to more sharp falls when markets open on Tuesday.
On Monday the Dow Jones Industrial Average index tumbled 1,175 points, or 4.6% to close down at 24,345.75.
The decline was the largest in percentage terms for the Dow since August 2011, when markets dropped in the aftermath of "Black Monday" - the day Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit rating of the US.
The drop on the Dow was closely followed by the wider S&P 500 stock index, down 4.1% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq, which lost 3.7%.
The White House moved to reassure investors saying it was focused on "long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong".
The heavy losses in Asia track the slide on Wall Street. Investors are reacting to changes in the outlook for the American and global economy, and what that might mean for the cost of borrowing.
"The share selling reflects a higher than previously anticipated interest rate environment," CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy said.
In response to that, investors moved to sell out of stocks and put money into assets like bonds which benefit from higher interest rates.
"This isn't a collapse of the economy. This isn't a concern that markets aren't going to do well," said Erin Gibbs, portfolio manager for S&P Global Market Intelligence.
"This is concern that the economy is actually doing much better than expected and so we need to re-evaluate," she said.
Analysts say investors in the short term, investors should be prepared for choppier stock markets.
Joel Prakken, chief US economist for IHS Markit, predicts share price gains will be limited over the next two years. "The difference between this year and last year is we're going to see more periods of volatility like this as the market reacts to higher inflation," he said.
"We're just not used to it because it's been so long since we've had a significant correction."
However, he added that markets would need to deteriorate more significantly for him to start to worry about the broader economy.

BASL concerned over case against former CJ, Judge
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) yesterday argued against the initiation of criminal proceedings against former Chief Justice Mohan Pieris PC and Court of Appeal Judge A.H.M.D Nawaz.
Addressing a press conference at the BASL Auditorium its Secretary Amal Randeniya said the Executive Committee and the Bar Council of the BASL unanimously resolved to view with grave concern the initiation of criminal proceedings against former CJ, Mohan Pieris and Justice Nawaz.
The BASL was of the opinion that criminal proceedings against the former CJ and Justice Nawaz on the basis of professional advice given by them in their former capacities as the Attorney General and Deputy Solicitor General affects the "independence of Judiciary, rule of Law and the interests of the public at large.
The Bribery Commission on January 18 filed a corruption case in the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court against former CJ, Peiris and Justice Nawaz over an allegation that they conferred a wrongful or unlawful benefit, and favour or advantage on the perpetrators who had been accused of misappropriating funds belonging to Lanka Electricity Company (Private) Limited (LECO).
Responding to questions by journalists, Randeniya said the BASL has decided to make a submission at the Magistrate's Court, when the case is taken up again on March 8, to voice their concerns.
However, Randeniya took special pains to emphasize that the BASL do not intend to obstruct or interfere with the course of justice or the right of law enforcement institutions to carry out their functions.
Our concern stems not from the stand point of the individuals concerned. The AG and Solicitor General are duty bound to give advice and their opinion on legal matters.An opinion could either be right or wrong. The professional advice given by the AG and Solicitor General or their deputies should not be a cause to initiate criminal proceedings. If not, the individuals holding such office would hesitate to discharge their functions.It would not set a good example, he commented.

Beware, its male-dominated!
The role of males in Indian classical dance forms is immeasurable. In many Indian classical dance forms, like Kuchipudi, Odissi, and Bhagavata Mela, were only performed by the male dancers in ancient times. In the later years, the females started participating in some of the classical dance forms, except Bhagavata Mela and Kathakali,
Kuchipudi is a classical dance form of Telugu Desha, based on drama. Earlier, the male dancers dressed, as female dancers, but later females started playing important roles in Kuchipudi. Today Kuchipudi is the classical dance form of Andhra Pradesh, and female dancers are the main participants.
Oral conversation
The Bhagavata Mela is another Indian classical dance form which has close links with Kuchipudi. Like Kuchipudi this is also a drama based dance, thats why it is considered as a dance drama. As in Kuchipudi, oral conversation, take place, between the dancers and the musicians. Bhagavata Mela dance drama is still preserved and practised by only the males. The special feature of Bhagavata Mela is only preserved and practised by the male Brahmin community. But Bhagavata Mela dance drama had laid down a firm foundation for the development of dance drama, in Bharatha Natyam.
Besides these, in Odissi dance, it has its origin from Orissa state. Earlier Odissi dancers were males. They were called Gotipuas. These male dancers dressed as females while they danced. It is essentially a temple dance. Even today many of the Odissi dance teachers are Gotipuas of yesteryears. The music of Odissi is a fusion of Carnatic music and Hindustani music. Traditionally Gotipuas were dancing on two important occasions. One was Chandra Jatra, and other was Jhoolan Jatra. Initially, this dance form originated and was based on Vaishnava cult. And later it was also cherished and adopted in Saivaism. In olden days they adorned themselves with many ornaments, but today they sparingly use limited and necessary ornaments.
Another Indian classical dance form is Kathak. It is a popular classical dance form of North India. Here in this classical dance form, the male dancers play an equal role with female dancers. Even in teaching Kathak, the role of the males is equally important. The male Kathak dancers wear simple costumes.
They wear long pyjamas and specially designed tops. They dont wear many ornaments, and they do not have any hairdressing.
Classical form
Kathakali is another Indian classical dance form based on Hinduism. Even the female characters are danced by the male dancers, and still, males play a major role in this classical dance form. Originally this was danced by the males alone. These male dancers were called Chakaiyer. The music is totally based on Carnatic music. The dance themes are generally based on various epics and puranic and ithikasa stories. Kathakali dance form uses heavy makeup and uses different masks appropriate to the character portrayed.
Kireedam or the crown is worn by the dancers along with the side face masks. The ornaments are placed and tied to the dresses.
Another Indian classical dance form is Manipuri. The male dancers play equally important roles with the female dancers. The male Manipuri dancers generally carry a different variety and different shape of drums, while they dance. Sometimes while they perform they carry large cymbals (which are called Kartaal) and dance.
The male Manipuri dancers generally wear white dhotis, and many of times they do wear white colour turbans. This is the special and distinct feature of the Manipuri male dancers as compared to the male dancers of other Indian classical dances. They hardly wear any ornaments. They do not even wear the ankle bells.
Indias most popular classical dance form is Bharatha Natyam. The Bharatha Natyam is evolved out of Sathir. In ancient days, lots of male dancers danced, Sathir in temples.
They were called by various names, like Chakai Maraiyan, Poonan, Santhi Koothan, Kootha Peeraiyan, Nattuva Aasan, and Araiyer. High awards were awarded to these outstanding male dancers in olden days. For instance, Nattuva Kulothunga Chola Nirtha Peraiyan, Thiruvorai Chakai Mummdi Chola Nirutha Peeraiyan was some of the titles conferred on the outstanding performers. Still, there are a number of outstanding male dancers and numerous outstanding dance teachers, choreographers. Some of them still belong to the traditional Nattuvanar clan.
Dominant figure
In all the Indian classical dance forms, the males play important roles with female dancers. The contribution of males for the development of certain classical dance forms is more than that of the females. Kuchipudi and Odissi originally were danced by males alone. Bhagavata Mela is still wholly performed by the male performers. In Kathakali, the male dancers are the main dancers. Females are not traditionally supposed to perform in Kathakali.
The male dancers play important role in Kathak and Manipuri with female dancers.
In Bharata Natyam, the most outstanding gurus are the males and there are a very few outstanding male performers in the present practical field.

Born under divine wrath Natha Devalaya at Dodanwala
Dodanwala village in Yatinuwara came to be known for its Natha Devalaya where people visit on Kemmura days (Wednesdays and Saturdays) to fulfil their vows or seek blessings of the Natha deity. The Dodanwala Devalaya can be reached by road from the turnoff at Kiribathkumbura on the Kandy Colombo main road and travel along nearly three miles towards Muruthalawa town.
After reaching the veediya of the Devalaya with Na trees for shade on either side leading to the devalaya, while walking through the canopy of trees one gets the feeling of the sanctity of the abode of the deity.
Surprise voice
There are myths and legends related to the origin of the belief centred around the worship of the Natha Deiyo (deity). Once a villager from this area accidentally cut down a Na plant. Lo! To his surprise a red liquid began to ooze out and added to this phenomena he began to fall into a trance and heard a voice calling him to erect a dwelling place and sanctifying it for Natha deity and other deities.
Thus the devalaya at first came to be called Nahimige Kovil and later people began to call it Dodanwala devalaya famous for its miraculous happenings. There is a historical incident that happened during the reign of King Rajasinha II (1635-1687) when the ancient route from Kandy to Balana passed through Dodanwala village. The king one day was on his way to the battle against the Portuguese who were preparing to invade Kandy.
The king wanted to inspect the preparations made by his men through the impending invasion of the Portuguese at Danture. The palanquin bearers who carried the king began to get frightened and could not proceed any further.
They felt that some mysterious power made them halt while they were passing through the devale premises. They humbly requested their king to alight from the palanquin and walk. Ignoring what was requested the king ordered his men to carry him. To his surprise, the crossbar of the palanquin snapped into two.
Trembled king
Thus the king decided to sit under a Na tree which stands to this day and ordered the Kapurala to be brought before him without further delay. When the man appeared before him he trembled with fear. The king told him, This is a good opportunity for you to show me the power of your god. Now mend the snapped crossbar of my palanquin.
He also said, In case you fail to do so, I will flatten the devalaya to the ground and I will get you beheaded.
Kapurala trembling with fear promised the king saying that he would pray and ask the divine power to help in mending the broken crossbar of the palanquin so that he could continue his journey.
Kapurala began to pray to god but to his dismay, he found there was no coconut oil for him to light the clay lamp. He went to collect some water from a rook that could be used to light the lamp, poured it into the lamp and lit the wick. To everyones surprise, the lamp was lit!
The broken crossbar was then wrapped in a clean white cloth. Again he began his invocation asking God to help him in mending the broken crossbar. After the conclusion of this religious rites, he asked the kings men to examine the crossbar. They were surprised to see it in a perfect state.
The king was overwhelmed with joy and proceeded on his journey. Before he left he made a vow promising the deity after he wins the battle he would present his crown and jewellery he wore to the devalaya as a token of gratitude.
Hidden treasure
After he won the battle at Danture, the king fulfilled his vow. Later the crown was removed to be placed in the Kandy museum.
In the 1960s the crown was stolen from the Kandy museum and a replica of it is now on display for the public to view.
It is also said that Na trees were planted by the king to form a veta (fence) and donated lands and fields for the maintenance of the devalaya.
The king ordered the annual Esala Perahera of the devalaya to be held after the conclusion of the Mahanuwara Esala Maha Perahera.
There was an incident related to the power of the Natha deity when a band of Portuguese soldiers who believed there was treasure inside the devalaya made an attempt to enter the premises using their force when they were attacked by hornets that came from inside the devalaya. The intruders had to run for their lives when the Hornets began hovering around them.
Na Puttuva  two Na trees stand close to each other connected by a single branch forming an archway  a marvellous sight to see! It is difficult for one to identify the tree that had sprouted from the branch.
Dragons hall
The architectural style of the devalaya has similar features of the Maha Devalaya in Kandy. From the veediya, one can ascend the premises by climbing the main flight of steps, to the Maha Maluwa.
This open pillared hall is the Hewisi Mandapaya where drummers perform during the Thevava times when offerings to the deity are made. At the entrance to the inner sanctum, there is a colourful Makarana Thorana.
Inside the sanctum, there are no statues. Instead, there are portraits of two kings painted on wood and of which one is believed to be that of King Rajasinha II.
Among the valuable donations by the king two embroidered silk jackets, swords and daggers and a carved palanquin. There is also a brass crown below into Vessamuni the demon king.
Above the sanctum is an upper storey called Devata Kotuwa where the sacred weapons or Ran Auda of the deity are kept. Connected to the new building by a low roofed passage stands a building consisting of Muluthange (kitchen), Gabadage (stores) and Vee Atuwa (barn). There are now stone pillars in the place where the Vee Atuwa used to be.
Colourful pageant
The annual Esala Perahera of the Dodanwala Devalaya begins after the Mahanuwara Esala Perahera has concluded. The perahera commences with the Kap planting ceremony officiated by the Kapu Rala.
At the auspicious time of the selected day, a sapling of the Esala tree is washed, wrapped in a clean white cloth, placed in the inner sanctum of the devalaya and the celebrations last for 16 days.
On the first day Kumbal Perahera consisting of flag bearers, dancers and drummers parade round the devalaya for six nights.
The second stage of the perahera is known as Devala Perahera which parades the Veediya passing the dancing for six consecutive nights.
The Randoli Perahera is the grandest of and the most spectacular perahera with caparisoned elephants, dancers and drummers parading the Veediya. In these Randoli Perahera or the golden palanquins bearing the insignia of the Natha deity is taken for four nights.
The Esala festival of the devalaya is brought to an end with the Diyakepeema or water cutting ceremony on the waters of Mahaweli Ganga at the getambe ferry.

BP profits double on higher oil price
BP's annual profits more than doubled in 2017, largely thanks to the global increase in oil prices.
The oil giant made $6.2bn ($4.4bn), up from $2.6bn made during the previous 12 months.
Chief executive Bob Dudley hailed it "as one of the strongest years in BP's recent history".
BP opened seven new oil and gas fields during 2017 and its oil production rose 12% to 247 million barrels of oil per day.
Last week, BP announced that it hoped to double North Sea oil production to 200,000 barrels by 2020 through a variety of projects.
"We enter the second year of our five-year plan with real momentum," Mr Dudley said.
"We are increasingly confident that we can continue to deliver growth across our business, improving cash flows and returns for shareholders out to 2021 and beyond."
Its fourth quarter profits rose to $2.1bn, compared with $400m over the same three-month period in 2016.
Oil companies have been boosted by the rising price of crude oil.
In early January, the price of oil hit $70 a barrel for the first time since December 2014.
Prices have been rising since late 2016 when members of the Opec oil cartel made a co-ordinated effort to curb their output.
BP spent years in recovery mode after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
Eleven people were killed and 17 injured in an explosion with an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil leaking into the Gulf as a result.
The total cost to the company came to more than $60bn and it had to sell off assets in order to pay the bill.
Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said, "Wider market weakness has eclipsed the sturdy performance which BP has delivered.
"The company's ability to generate cash remains prodigious.
"BP is in fine shape, particularly considering the tribulations of recent times." BBC News

Calls to amend section 81 to institute civic disability
A sum of Rs. 12 billion of Perpetual Treasuries has been withheld and the Central Bank Governor has assured that the money is there, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation in Parliament moving the adjournment debate on the Bond Commission report and on the Presidential Commission report on Serious Crimes and Abuse of Power (PRECIFAC).
The Premier also suggested that Parliament should consider amending Section 81 of the Constitution, the section that imposes civic disability on the recommendation of a Presidential Commission.
He also queried if the party leaders were ready to amend section 81 of the constitution or if they were scared to do so, he asked.
Moving the adjournment motion, the Premier said the President had presented two Presidential Commission reports, namely the Bond Commission Report and the PRECIFAC report on December 30.
However as the members needed to debate on the same, I sent a letter to summon sittings on January 10.
He added that the Chief Opposition Whip Anura Dissanayake pointed out that it was impossible as the reports had not been presented to Parliament. He added that the reports were presented to Parliament on January 23.
Thereafter, on the request of the members, the debate was fixed for February 8 and then the Election Commissioner said that if the debate was taken on February 8 the Local Government Election will have to be postponed by two days. Therefore,Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and I decided to take up the debate on February 6 (yesterday), the Premier said.
He said that action, in connection with the Bond Commission Report has already been taken. Statements have been taken from relevant persons, some have been produced before Courts and some have been remanded.
With regard to the PRECIFAC there are steps yet to be taken. There are around 30 persons involved. A new Act will be presented on the Central Bank.We will reform the Central Bank by way of a new Financial Act, the PM said.
The government will also present legislation to create a Budget Office soon. He also added that Parliament will have to consider on amending Section 81 of the constitution.

Cape Town braces for Day Zero
SOUTH AFRICA: Residents of drought-stricken Cape Town received rare good news on Monday when city officials said they now face losing piped water to their homes on May 11 -- a month later than previously forecast.
But Capetonians are not yet out of the woods. If drastic consumption reductions are not achieved by so-called Day Zero, people will have to queue at 200 standpipes for daily rations of 25 litres (6.6 US gallons). The city, which attracts millions of tourists every year, has enforced strict waste controls including prosecution of homeowners who use more than the current 50-litre daily limit.
The day we may have to start queueing for water is expected to move out to mid-May 2018 due to a decline in agricultural usage, deputy mayor Ian Neilson said in a statement. Capetonians must continue reducing consumption if we are to avoid Day Zero. There has not been any significant decline in urban usage. All Capetonians must therefore continue to use no more than 50 litres.
Every day the city uses more than 450 million litres, so-called Day Zero -- the last day of normal water supply -- becomes more likely. In the past week, city-wide consumption stood at an average of 547 million litres daily.
The previous forecast for Day Zero was April 16.
The city has published a name-and-shame list of the worst water offenders in Cape Town, and it says it is issuing fines for the heaviest water users.
But officials have been criticised for failing to implement usage restrictions sooner, and accused of ignoring warnings by experts in the years before the drought.
Strong summer rains saw much of southern Africa recover from a drought induced by the El Nino weather phenomenon.
But Mediterranean-like Cape Town receives most of its rain in the southern hemispheres winter -- and scientists warn there is no guarantee of a good rainy season. - AFP

CEA approved biodegradable  wrapping sheets, bags to market
The countrys first biodegradable and compostable food wrapping sheets and bags approved by the Central Environmental Authority manufactured by Plastic Packaging Pte Ltd (PPP) has been introduced to super centres.
Over 10 million such biodegradable and compostable food wrapping sheets and bags manufactured by Plastic Pakaging Pte Ltd (PPP) are currently used by Sri Lankan major super centres under the brand name `Naturplus.
The certified food wrapping sheets are currently available in all leading supermarkets.
In addition, the PPP also exports their products to the UK market and plans to expand by catering to few other foreign markets during this year.
The government banned the using of 20 micron polythene lunch sheets in Sri Lanka from September 1, 2017 and strictly re-imposed the ban with effect from January this year, considering the massive environmental pollution in the country.
The 30 year old Plastic Pakaging Pvt Ltd (PPP) confirms that `Naturplus bags do not contain any polythene and it has been certified in Belgium by Vincotte with the OK compost home and seedling logo.
Speaking to Daily News Business PPP, Chairman Mervyn Dias said the certification is given by Vincotte after testing the products in independent labs .
He said the certification is granted with all relevant reports highlighting that the bags would get composted in industrial units and in home composting units within a very short period and it does not pollute the environment such as polythene papers that takes over 500 years to get composted . The PPP further says that the biodegradable and compostable standard food wrapping sheets and bags are 100% environmentally friendly and suggests consumers throw the food wrapping sheets in the home compost bin after using.
Meanwhile, CEA invited countrywide all manufacturers and importers of biodegradable and compostable products to be registered with the Central Environmental Authority since all manufacturers and importers of biodegradable and compostable products have to comply with the standards specified by the Sri Lanka Standard Institution (SLSI).

CHENA CULTIVATION AGAINST ALL ODDS
In the village of Iddamal in the Galgamuwa Divisional Secretariat, the paddy fields are lush and green and despite the drought and fertilizer shortage in the area, the villagers together have successfully cultivated 100 acres of chena to the surprise of many others whose own fields have perished in the last two years.
The village is situated three kilometers away from the Anuradhapura - Padeniya main road and these farmers spoke of the hard work they put in every day to ensure a profitable harvest in the midst of a drought.
There are about 70 families living in this village. Everyone here is a farmer. But for about four seasons we could not cultivate any paddy. But that does not mean we have to resign ourselves to our fate and starve, said Ananda Wiejsinghe one of the farmers in Iddamal.
Wijesinghe explained that the continuous struggle they individually underwent to ensure a harvest had prompted them to think of an alternative.
Working together
The villagers together decided to engage in Chena cultivation. In three to four months, we cut down, at regular intervals, the trees of a small jungle land and set fire to the woody growths as far as possible to begin cultivation. Normally, one person owns three to four acres of land but here we decided to combine all our lands and help each other, he said.
He added that the bringing together of all their lands into one big plot had made a huge difference in their output and harvest.
We had to face many challenges when we started the cultivation. It was not that easy. But we accepted all those challenges with the objective of making it a success.
Chena cultivation is done in many surrounding areas but we have not seen any place where cultivation is done in an organised manner, he said.
K. P. Wijeratne, his fellow farmer observed that these crops were in such a lush state due to their collective hard work.
We planted it with great difficulty when we did not have enough water. There is scarcity of water in these areas. But, we never considered that an impossible challenge to overcome. We started digging cultivation wells, but that too only yielded a bit of water. We also took water from the village lake by constructing small canals.
The only difficulty we have now is finding the water we need. We can somehow manage to find the other things, he said.
Wijeratne remarked that the officials at the Agrarian Services Department too had helped them greatly through the provision of support and technical know-how.
We were given seeds by the United Nations Development Fund and the Agrarian Service Department. Similar to water, we also face many problems in finding fertilizer. There is no fertilizer in shops, he said.
The villagers cultivation at present includes maize, cashew nuts, chili, peas and eggplants. In addition they have also taken to planting chickpeas and green beans separately.
It has been three to four months since we planted these. Now, the harvesting period is getting closer. We have to work very hard during the harvest period.
We do not have enough money. We borrow money from people to bring in the harvest.
The Agrarian Services bank is supporting us a lot, they granted us loans at a lower interest rate. That's helping us a lot, said K. M. Kusumavathi, who was helping her husband in the fields.
She added that they also devoted a lot of time to save their crop from wild animal attacks.
We feel relaxed after having started the Chena cultivation. We all go to the fields early in the morning and we would return home late at night. I feel relaxed spending time in the fields than at home. We have built a small hut closer to the fields; we cook and eat there as well. This is how we spend our lives, she said. A kilogram of their peas and egg plants fetch Rs 200 according to Kusumavathi.
Agriculture Research and Development Officer I. G. S. Kumara Jayathilake said he was amazed to see the chena cultivation done by these villagers.
Even though it rained a little bit, it did not serve any good to these lands. The farmers along with their wives face immense difficulties to get this done. We provided them with the necessary advice to make it a success and they all worked together to achieve it. We continuously had contact with the farmers to make sure that they do it in a proper way, he said.
He noted that the women worked equally as hard as the men in the fields.
Jayathilake noted that having seen the villages work very hard on their crop, he was positive that they would turn things around. The official said they would continue to provide them with all possible assistance in future too.
Regional officer of the Agrarian Services Department, D.W. S. Pradeep said that it was a great challenge to engage in chena cultivation in a rural area like Galgamuwa where many facilities are hard to come by.
But the villagers accepted this challenge and they have made it a success, he said.
He added that the fields of Iddamal was a great example to farmers everywhere who complain of lack of facilities but do not do the hard work needed to reap a harvest.

Chinese consumption posts faster growth than GDP
Consumption has remained the primary force driving Chinas economic growth in the past four years, with its growth rate 3.2 percentage points higher than GDP on average, said Gao Feng, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce (MOC), on Thursday.
From 2013 to 2017, the average rate for consumption reached 11.3 percent, he said in a news conference and added that the total retail sales of consumer goods hit 36.6 trillion yuan last year, a 10.2 percent increase from a year earlier and maintaining double-digit growth over the past 14 years.
At the same time, consumption-related sectors also shone in the Chinese economy. As data from MOC showed, wholesale and retailing in 2017 recorded tax revenue of 2.12 trillion yuan, rising by 20.3 percent year-on-year, accounting for 23.5 percent of the total revenue growth.
With the increase in income, Chinese residents are more willing to consume, said a report by the International Finance Institute of the Bank of China.
The report added that the rapid development of consumer finance and the upgrading of consumption patterns will also contribute to stable consumption growth in 2018.
According to Shanghai Securities News, the general picture is that provinces and regions presented faster growth in residents income compared to local GDP rate last year. And the same trend also applies to the local governments goal this year.
The newspaper cited Chu Jianfang, chief economist with CITIC Securities, as saying that the rise in residents income is boosting consumption and it will also underpin this years consumption momentum.
Chu predicted the economic growth rate for 2018 will remain around 6.8 percent.

CID yet to release production items of VAT case
An aggrieved party of the controversial VAT case alleged that they were yet to receive inventory receipts of the confiscated documents belonging them even though a court order had been issued to do so one year ago.
On December 2016, The Colombo Chief Magistrates Court had issued an order directing the CID to release the inventory receipts of the confiscated documents belonging an aggrieved party of the controversial VAT case, which were mixed them up with the production items of the VAT case.
The Chief Magistrates Court had made this order consequent to a request by counsel appeared on behalf of Mrs. Shirani Anoma Wettasinghe Dullewa an aggrieved party of the controversial VAT case, the inventory receipts of the confiscated documents be released to them in accordance with High Court judgment.
An aggrieved party of the controversial VAT case alleged that the Criminal Investigations Department was yet to release the inventory receipts of the confiscated documents belonging to them, which were mixed them up with the production items of the VAT case.
On October 3, 2014 the Colombo High Court ordered the release of the receipts of the confiscated documents belonging to Mrs. Shirani Anoma Wettasinghe Dullewa and her son, a third party, after delivering the judgment of the main case.
A letter forwarded by the secretary to the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) had also maintained that the certified copies of the inventory receipts (Confiscated 37 documents) could be handed over to Mrs. Shirani Anoma Wettasinghe Dullewa after delivering the judgment.
However, the aggrieved party observed that even though more than two years have passed after delivering the judgment, the CID was yet to release the inventory receipts.
Filing an affidavit before Colombo High Court, Mrs. Dullewa had stated that a large number of deposit certificates belonging to her and her son Upendra Wettasinghe Dullewa were found among the production items of the VAT case.
She requested Court that an order be issued to release the deposit certificates belonging to her and her son if they were not relevant to the VAT fraud case (4027/7) and unless included in the witness list.
On a previous occasion, counsel appearing for the aggrieved party informed Court that the money his clients earned from overseas had been deposited in Treasury bills with the approval of the Central Bank and the relevant documents pertaining to the deposited money were taken into CID custody.
The counsel said these documents were not relevant to the VAT fraud case and the CID might have mixed it up with the VAT case documents.
In this case, the 14 accused were indicted on 34 charges including misappropriation of public funds amounting to Rs. 3,996,008,151 belonging to Inland Revenue Department before the Colombo High Court. The offences were said to have been committed between November 15, 2002 and December 15, 2004 along with late Neville Shantha Waththegedara.

While thanking Nipuna Wickramage for his charitable review of my book On Films Seen on January 10, particularly his last paragraph in the review: Once again, it all comes down to individual taste. But that individual taste matters when a seasoned columnist like K S Sivakumaran is at it. Which is exactly why his latest book is worth reading.
As the writer of the book, I need to say more about the content of the book for the benefit of the interested reader. Please let me do it.
This 176-page book published by S. Godage & Brothers (Pvt) Ltd and priced at Rs.650/- is divided into five sections: Understanding the Film, Sinhala Films, Indian Films among World Cinema, A Note on Lankan Tamil Films, Reviews of International Films.
Before I give additional information, I should also mention the pictures displayed on the front and back covers of the book. In the front cover, there are scenes from the following films: Shakespeare in Love, Agantuk with the portrait of Satyajit Ray, Eiffel Tower symbolising the French Cinema, and a scene from the film A Perfect World directed by Clint Eastwood.
In the back cover, there are pictures of Fassbinder, the German filmmaker, a scene from Sankranti, and a scene from Avvai Shanmugam with redoubtable Kamal Haasan in a womans role.
Young Lankan filmmakers could benefit by reading the eight articles under the heading Understanding the Film focusing on five Sinhala films seen at International Film Festivals. Also spotlighted are selective 24 critical notes on 24 Indian films and personalities as recorded in the next category. Place is also given to Lankan Tamil Cinema with a simple note. Impressions on 20 films from various countries are discussed in the final section.
This section covers films from Europe, South Africa, Latin America, Asia, South East Asia, South Asia, Australia and North America. Our readers might not have had the opportunity to see such films, but at least we could read about them as seen by the writer.
About 58 films are introduced in this tightly compiled book.
The writer expects the considered views of some of our erstwhile commentators in the calibre of Sir Lester James Peries, Sumithra Peries, Dr Edwin Ariyadasa, Gamini Akmeemena, Lynn Ockersz, Uditha Devapriya and other personalities in the near future.
More than I speak of my book, it is worth reading the views of others whom I respect.
We have lost some fine literary critics in the English Language and others who do not write anymore.
More Some names come to my mind: Regi Siriwardena, Ashley Halpe, A J Gunawardena, Gamini Haththottegama, Philip Cooray, Ajit Samaranayake, Godfrey Goonatileke, Jayanta Dhanapala, Tissa Jayathilaka, Wimal Dissanayake and Carlo Fonseka. A few more names I cannot recollect immediately. I like their style of writing.
I wish that some of them living will buy this book On Films Seen from the Godage Bookshop in Maradana as they are the publishers of this book.

Committed to root out corruption - Hashim
UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim yesterday said that President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are committed to supporting the law enforcement and justice system to prosecute all offenders, no matter what their political affiliations.
Hashim in a statement said that the officers investigating this serious financial crime and all other crimes can be assured that under this government their independence will continue to be sacred.
It is what the people of Sri Lanka voted for on January 8, 2015, and it is a vision to which we remain committed, he said.
The full statement by UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim on the arrest of Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena yesterday:
Officers of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) placed Perpetual CEO Kasun Palisena, and beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius,under arrest, after they were named on Friday at the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court as suspects for having committed serious financial crimes against the state.These arrests come in the wake of the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds, which found that former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran had provided inside information that allowed Perpetual Treasuries to be illegally enriched through treasury bond auctions that took place during his tenure.
Notwithstanding the many months for which we have all waited patiently for results after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe instructed the Attorney Generals Department to take action against the offenders in November 2016, the country owes its gratitude to the officers of the CID whose tireless efforts and dedication led to todays arrests.
Their work has been unimpeachable and untainted by personal or political agendas. The decision to place Aloysius and Palisena under arrest, and to seek the attendance of Mahendran before court, was a decision taken unilaterally by the CID in consultation with the Attorney General. These officers investigating this serious financial crime and all other crimes can be assured that under this government their independence will continue to be sacred, and that the President and Prime Minister are committed to supporting the law enforcement community and justice system to prosecute all offenders no matter what their political affiliation.
This is Good Governance in action. It is what the people of Sri Lanka voted for on January 8, 2015, and it is a vision to which we remain committed.It is instructive to compare the investigation into the treasury bond scandal to the hundreds of criminal investigations into acts of violence and graft committed by the Rajapaksa regime.Unlike the billions of dollars stolen from the mouths of our people through the likes of the MiG deal, Helping Hambantota, the Norochcholai Power Plant deal, these treasury bond crimes occurred on our watch.This government and the UNP has a moral responsibility to hold those responsible accountable, and purge those involved from our ranks.Arjuna Mahendran has been removed as Governor of the Central Bank. A UNP minister has stepped down from his cabinet position and post within the party. The law enforcement community dedicated unprecedented resources to getting to the root of the Bond deal, exposing wrongdoing, and holding the culprits accountable. No politician from any party can claim credit for these acts.
The accomplishments of an independent police and Attorney Generals Department can be credited primarily to the 19th amendment to the Constitution, which the UNP and President Sirisena both fought for vigorously. This government is committed to safeguarding the independence of these sacred institutions, as well as the judiciary. That is Yahapalanaya. The Department and police must embrace their independence and use the maximum extent of their powers under the law to prosecute and convict all offenders, including those named as suspects in the 34 reports forwarded by the PRECIFAC commission into serious crimes, fraud and corruption under the previous government.
These thirty-four complex financial investigations combined have to date received fewer resources, less manpower and attention from the police and attorney generals department than did the Commission of Inquiry into the bond scandal. The public cannot be blamed for wondering how many more criminals could be brought to justice, and how many more billions of rupees in stolen state assets recovered if these other investigations too received the same attention.
This government will not interfere with the police and Attorney Generals Department and dictate their priorities. If there is an absence of resources to achieve the results that Sri Lankans deserve, it must be brought to our attention by law officers, so the government may solve the problem. This is how the FCID and Special Presidential Task Force on Asset Recovery (START) came to be, and the Digital Forensics laboratory of the CID. Equally important as our duty to protect the independence of these institutions is our duty to empower them with the tools, resources and political will and support necessary to carry out their duty without fear or favour.
Our police and prosecutors have several more challenging investigations and criminal trials of national importance before them, from the vicious murders of Lasantha Wickrematunge and Prageeth Ekneligoda, to the corruption of the likes of the MiG and Avant Garde deals. Our message to the prosecutors, police and other public officers is a simple one: Conduct your investigations with thoroughness and speed. Deliver the justice that the people of Sri Lanka deserve and have long awaited.Your government proudly stands by you and salutes your service.

Eshan once again wins Rotax Invitational Race in Malaysia
Sri Lankas Eshan Pieris once again lived up to his record as one of Asias best karters by winning the Rotax Invitational Race 2018 held in Malaysia last week.
This came hot on the heels of his brilliant performance at the X30 Asia Cup 2018 held on the preceding weekend in Bandaragama, Sri Lanka where he took second place in the senior category in a hard-fought race with his nemesis Prassetyo Hardja of Indonesia.
Driving in the DD2 class, the Qualifying saw Eshan, the defending champion in this race in 3rd place, which meant he started both heats from this position. Then a brilliant show of skill and determination saw him win both heats.
Heat no 2 saw a nail biting finish when a last lap manoeuvre on pole sitter Nazim Azman ensured Eshan secure 1st starting position for the prefinal which he went on to dominate from start to finish.
Although it was a rainy day at the Sepang track, the sun came back with a vengeance and dried up the track fast just before the finals. Once again, the clear leader from the start, Eshan made it impossible for the rest to catch up and closest was Nik Zamir, but the gap was just too wide for him to take the lead.
Nik Zamir finished 2nd and Manav Sharma finished 3rd. Yuki Mishima, a new Japanese driver, finished 4th in his DD2 debut. Coming in 5th was 2017 overall DD2 champion Prassetyo Hardja who faced technical issues the whole weekend and was forced to pulled out in the Prefinal.
However, in the final he made a brilliant start and climbed up to 6th and worked his way up to 5th place.
Presently an undergraduate at the Monash University in Malaysia, Eshan represents the RL Karting Team from Malaysia.
This is the first Rotax race of the season before the Asia Max Challenge 2018 Round 1 starts in March.

European shares tumble in new sell off
European markets have followed Asian markets lower on Tuesday as investors continued to dump shares.
London, Frankfurt and Paris all fell sharply at the open with losses of up to 3%, before recovering some ground. In the US overnight the Dow lost 4.6%. The sell-off began last week after data in the US showed stronger wage growth, which raised expectations that US interest rates might start to rise more quickly to tackle inflation.
Londons FTSE 100 was down 126 points or almost 2% at 7,207 after the first few hours of trading, while Frankfurts Dax and Pariss CAC were down 2% and 1.6% respectively.
On Monday the FTSE 100 closed at its lowest level since April of last year. The falls follow some good years for investors.
In 2017 the Dow in the US was up 25% and Londons FTSE 100 rose 7.6%.The softness of markets over the last few days is down to one thing.
As monetary policy begins its long journey away from the trillions of pounds of stimulus pumped into the system to keep the economic ship from the rocks, shareholders are beginning to wonder how much of their investments are in companies with strong fundamentals. And how much is simply holding up an asset bubble - frothy prices led ever higher in an era of ultra low interest rates and cheap money.

Goals change, but never the passion
A great leader shows the way through leading by example with kindness and understanding. So believes Kavindi Perera, Head Girl of Gateway College Colombo, who not only believes that leadership means guiding the way but also embodies the art of it. Perfect Prefect presents Kavindi Perera, a young lady who trusts that actions speak louder than words.
There is a common misunderstanding that leadership means being bossy. This is not so. A good leader is one who is able to guide others and lead by example. Someone who can handle the pressures and the responsibility that comes with the position while understanding the privilege it holds said Perera.
Overcoming Obstacles
Having numerous responsibilities while striving to maintain her academic ventures, Kavindi Perera is thankful that she has her fellow Head Prefect, Yeran Karunanayake alongside her. Together, they believe that they can overcome any obstacle.
Aided by their Prefects Guild consisting of 30 prefects and sometimes 60 when the senior prefects from Grade 13 and junior prefects from Grade 12 overlap, they are able to maintain discipline during assemblies, in classes and in the corridors as well as organise events with maximum efficiency.
Regular weekly meetings as well as additional meetings in preparation for events ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the prefects are able to handle anything that comes their way. All ideas are welcomed and taken into account before a final decision is made and executed.
Motivated by giving back to and bringing honour to his alma mater, Karunanayake said Leading by example and co-ordinating together as a team ensures that there is no problem. Everyone is balanced and everyone contributes to which Perera nodded vigorously. Their competence and understanding is what ensures the efficiency and smooth running of events and discipline within the school.
Following in Footsteps
High Achievers Award.
Kavindi Perera expressed her great admiration for the founder of the school, R I T Alles. She believes that he was an inspiring leader who emulated the values in which she has come to place so much faith.
In my opinion, a good leader was R I T Alles, the founder of our school. He was persuasive and sincere especially with the students. He would interact with the students and speak kindly to them. He maintained a good relationship with the teachers and his other employees said Perera.
She feels that rather than being a leader who dictates orders and gives instructions, its better to guide the way by showing what needs to be done. A kind and compassionate leader is better than an overpowering one and she attempts to follow such footsteps when she handles discipline in the corridors, classes, school events and so on.
Creative Genius
No matter what prefect duties Perera is juggling, she always makes time for her studies. Her academic excellence is prominent and what she identifies as one of her key strengths.
I try never to miss a class as maintaining my academic standpoint is of utmost importance. It was one of the things my mother was especially concerned about when I was offered the position of Head Prefect. I try and ensure that I attend all my classes and delegate duties to my body of prefects to handle when I am in a class. If by some chance I miss a lesson I make sure that I catch up with the notes and that Im prepared for the next class no matter what said Perera.
An eighteen year old with a passion for economics, she hopes to make her impact on the world by someday entering a field that allows her to influence policy making. She currently has her sights on the World Bank.
In spite of her academic achievements, her excellence is not limited to the classroom. She participated in Model United Nations which helped her improve her public speaking capabilities. A budding journalist, perhaps, with her love for writing she was a part of her Journalists Club at school and even helped compile the yearly school magazine.
And thats not all! Her creative genius comes to the forefront as she dabblesin art, music, drama and was even part of the school choir. As if all this wasnt enough she even plays the piano for which she received an All Island Finalist award at the Sri Lanka Performing Arts and Music Festival.
Family Comes First
Even though she has the strength and fortitude to balance all her responsibilities, her family is always there to support her. Whenever life derails her, she has come to realize that her family is there to set her right back on track.
Being made a Head Prefect actually made me realise how much I depend on my family. Whenever I have a problem that seems unsolvable, I have found that my parents always have the solution. I have an elder brother who understands the issues that I might be facing and helps me out whenever I need him said Perera, smiling. Perera also pointed out that one must surround oneself with those one can trust. She has her family to rely on for she knows that through it all they will continue to support and inspire her.
We all need someone we can trust and trust is hard to come by. We also need others to trust us. In order to set an example for the younger students who look up to me, I need to gain their trust. Trust is a value that holds more importance than people realize. We all need someone who will be there through everything said Perera.
Making her list and checking it twice!
It was her mother who instilled in her the need to be organised and this helped greatly when she took on the position of Head Prefect. She keeps track of her daily activities by maintaining a checklist which she prepares either the previous night or in the morning. Be it meeting with a teacher, organising an event, catching up with classes, she puts it all on her list and by the end of the day ensures that each task has been accomplished.
Its this level of organisation that enables her to multitask successfully and has come into good use throughout her stint as head Prefect.
Headed by herself and fellow Head Prefect, Yeran Karunanayake, the Prefects Guild has successfully organised and co-ordinated a series of events. Following a Year Plan drafted at the beginning of their terms as prefects, they have co-ordinated Christmas and Halloween Carnivals, the school talent show Soul Rhythm and a unique fund raising pet show. They are also in charge of Awards Day and hope to organise a grand graduation.
One Direction
Perera believes in the need for goals. Her message to her peers and the youth of Sri Lanka is to set a goal and work in the direction of that goal, striving hard to achieve it for perseverance leads to accomplishment. Goals change. I used to want to be a teacher. That goal changed. My passion for economics has grown and so my goals have changed. Thats okay. Now with O/Ls and A/Ls in our minds we need to identify our goals and focus on them. Work in the direction of achieving the goals we have set so that we move closer and closer to achieving that goal, concluded Perera.

HAVE YOUR HEART GOT A HOME
We were a strange little band of characters trudging through life sharing diseases and toothpaste, coveting one anothers desserts, hiding shampoo, borrowing money, locking each other out of our rooms, inflicting pain and kissing to heal it in the same instant, loving, laughing, defending, and trying to figure out the common thread that bound us all together  Erma Bombeck.
When someone has a place to go, it is called a home and when having someone to love, it is called a family and when someone has both of these, then it is truly considered as a blessing. According to common definition, family means love, trust, communication, sharing, caring, being together, understanding, listening and space. These values become embedded in an individual that produces self-confidence and ability to achieve success in the future.
Family values are the solid cords with which every human being is well knitted through time to develop his character to bond with his core family unit and the world around him. These cords cannot be broken easily throughout a persons lifetime if he is brought up within a functional family unit till he reaches his adulthood. A well-functioning family is a microcosm of society as it should work. However, the contemporary unbecoming habits of socialization and overwork have certainly misled our attitudes towards living and abiding by a harmonious family relationship.
What is a Family
A family is a very important part of our everyday life as it helps us in improving our personality and shaping our lives. Furthermore, family is a place where you can be yourself and is a place where you are accepted for who and what you are without any prejudice. A place where its tension free and everyone is around to help you. A strong functional family motivates and encourages you to face, fight and overcome any problems that you are surrounded by and helps to survive through tough trying times and bring joy, peace and happiness in to your life.
But, a dysfunctional family is a unit with formal family relationships between one another that lacks providing emotional assistance among the family members. Emotional bonding causes one to hinge onto the rest of the family members to receive fruitful and affective nourishment. Unfortunately, the lack of this emotional wanting within the family unit causes the member to gradually move outward in the society to fulfill the craving need to be emotionally bonded by any means that can produce disastrous consequences by making him vulnerable and thus physically broken.
Another reason for a broken family is the greed for money wherein a member leaves behind the rest of the family and the family values in-order to achieve materialistic dreams and goals. Moreover, family members are susceptible to leave the rest and their home when they become financially independent and self-sufficient. Even though disintegration of the family cannot be considered a problem, lack of oneness within the family would surely be a problem for its survival and of the individual concerned.
The famous Archbishop, Desmond Tutu once said that you dont choose your family; rather they are Gods gift to you, as you are to them. None of us can decide to which family we would want to be born in to and the family members dont have a choice to reject the new addition into their fold. Every new born is embraced with warmth and unconditional love by the entire family from grandparents to the smallest member. An ideal extended family consists of grandparents, parents, siblings, children, nephews and nieces. However, a family could be as small as two people who are bound by a loving relationship and living together under one roof.
Foundational Nurturing and Grooming
Parents are considered as the primary teachers and trainers of their children before they are sent to school. It is the parents responsibility to ensure that their children are educated by them about the good and the bad things their children should be aware of from the moment they enter into this world. For this reason, it is very important that parents have time for their children no matter how busy they may be with their daily chores and other work.
It does not end when the child enters school. Rather, there is no end to having time to listen and spend time with your children. It is said that a family that prays together stays together. No matter what religion you belong to, it is important to train your children from their very small days to pray together with the rest of the family that brings unity and oneness within everyone.
Spending quality time with your children does not mean having to spend hours on a given day with your child. Rather, it is ensuring that you have at least a short time to listen to what your children have to say about their new experiences, answer their probing questions and giving reassurance that they can always approach you anytime if they need to express anything with you regarding their insecurities and other concerns.
Functional and Dysfunctional Family Units
Most present day working moms dont provide this very important benefit to their children due to working late hours. Instead, they leave their children with servants to attend them and to their needs. Besides, most contemporary dads and moms will buy and give their children whatever they wish, as well as give them any amount of pocket money, just to escape their involvement in doing things together, which is considered a waste of time of their busy daily schedules.
Doing fun things together is so rewarding and fulfilling to the entire family and does not consume a big portion of time if properly planned ahead. However, lack of parental guidance, missing quality time and breakage of constant communication, distances children from their parents thus pushing them towards loneliness and abandonment with a sense of lack of love and care, making them unknowingly go out and look for various self-destructive ways of filling that void within them that leads to developing harmful addictions they may never be able to recover from in their entire life time.
Relationship Building
Therefore, in this modern day and age that highly promotes ones independence, freedom and doing it yourself type of lifestyle, it is very important in order to bring broken families back together, that the peers commit themselves to living lives by a sense of trust and honor with other family members inculcating those precious values into their lives too. Seeing Eye to eye on common important topics, along with the ability to compromise on areas of disagreement, while making room for open honest communication on mutually important matters such as financial planning, ways of spending free time and deciding on what type of social ties to embrace and emphasize are fundamentally important for its survival.
Moreover, practicing mutual love through enduring deep warmth and affection towards the rest of the family members by being able to demonstrate a love that smiles at each others imperfections, without mocking or looking down on them and eager to serve one another, would reinstate a strong family with an unbreakable foundation that would withstand any type of stormy trials.

Over 2,000 projects from 178 countries were submitted for the prestigious environmental award in five categories: Earth, Fire, Water, Air and Youth. The jury, led by Maneka Gandhi, environmentalist and Indian Union Cabinet Minister for Women and Child Development, selected 16 finalists and awarded the 5 most outstanding environmental projects.
The award in the category Air went to the Austrian Post for reducing their ecological footprint by replacing conventional vehicles with electric vehicles in their operations. Sustainable Coastlines Charitable Trust from New Zealand received the award in the category Youth for their flagship education center, where pupils, community groups and business are taught to become guardians of the environment.
The award in the category Earth went to the Rural Green Environment Organization from Afghanistan for its efforts to reforest degraded watershed and establish fruit orchards through community involvement in one of the remotest and poorest mountainous valleys. Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences from India received the award in the category Fire. Green initiatives undertaken by this institute have found a great way to reduce the ecological footprint for large scale cooking.
To date Puritas Sathdiyawara provides 160,000 litres of clean drinking water daily to over 33,000 men, women and children across 19 villages in the North and North Central provinces since 2014.
Each project is sponsored by a Group Company, and to-date the Hayleys Group has invested more than Rs. 63 million in this initiative. It consists of a formalized water distribution network through a bowser and multiple docking stations throughout the village to ensure all villagers have equal access to purified water.
Chairman and Chief Executive of the Hayleys Group, Mohan Pandithage said, Sathdiyawara since its humble inception in 2014 has grown to be the heart of our Group CSR. I commend the Puritas Team for the incredible passion and love with which they have been driving this initiative and of course the Hayleys Group Companies who so generously contribute to the growth of this initiative.
The Teams work with large numbers of villages in the North and North Central provinces, at ground level to identify the most severely affected villages. We have gone above and beyond what we originally set out to achieve, by additionally supporting the communities with livelihood development opportunities. Each time I see the hopeful faces of the beautiful village children and their families, I feel blessed that we have been able to transform their lives and give them hope for a better, healthier future.
To me that is the greatest joy, but winning world acclaim for all the unwavering efforts of my Team is definitely exhilarating. Well done to the Team involved!
Managing Director, Haycarb and Puritas, Rajitha Kariyawasan said, This global recognition is beyond what we had ever envisioned when we started Hayleys Puritas Sathdiyawara in 2014. Our single-minded focus then and now, lies in eradicating CKD within the country.
Sathdiyawara also consciously supports villages whose grim conditions are exacerbated not only by this debilitating illness but also by drought, dry arid conditions including floods, which deny them of basic access to drinking water. We are extremely humbled beyond words that our genuine efforts have received such global acclaim.
We thank our Chairman and all the Hayleys Group Sectors who have stepped up to support this project which now has become the flagship CSR endeavour of the Hayleys Group.
Elaborating further Director Puritas  Sharmila Ragunathan who accepted the award at the Ceremony in Tehran and who spearheads the passionate team that leads this initiative added, This gift of life which we sincerely give to 33,000 Sri Lankans signifies a renewed hope for the future of these families. We do it out of genuine altruism.
While winning awards is not the reason behind this endeavour, winning this world award is undeniably, deeply encouraging and has motivated the Puritas Team to persevere and continue this life changing project with renewed passion and enthusiasm.

Heart transplant surgery
Over two decades ago, Sri Lanka had its first heart transplant surgery performed and one man who was lucky enough to be chosen for it was H. H. Liyanage, a resident of Akuressa, Paraduwa.
In 1991, the surgery was performed at Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital, Colombo, by a team of American doctors. Fifteen patients were chosen for the surgery; the second name on that list was that of Liyanage.
The first person to have undergone the procedure passed away, whilst the remaining 14 had successful operations. But today, it is only Liyanage who is alive.
He celebrated his 79th birthday on January 18, 2018 together with his two children and grandchildren.
When I faced the operation, bypass surgery had never been attempted in Sri Lanka. I was 51 at the time. I was admitted to Sri Jayawardena Hospital on August 8 1991. I was afraid at first and was hesitant as we did not know what this surgery was all about and it had never been done in the country before. The list had 15 names of patients in trial. The first person they did the surgery on did not survive it. I was the second but I fared well, he said.
I spent one week in hospital before I returned home. Thereafter, for a year I went to the clinic for monitoring. I did not have any heart problems after that. They did many tests to make sure nothing was wrong too. The doctors declared that the operation was a success, said Liyanage further.
I am 79 years now, and I go on with life as usual, doing all my day to day work, he added.
It was the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa who invited the American team to come and perform that surgery here. To this day we respected him for that and bless his soul.
By the time Liyanage had been chosen for the bypass surgery he has had several tests performed on him at the Colombo National Hospital. Heart Specialist Dr Tenabandu had informed him that 90 percent of his arteries in the heart were clogged and that he would either have to go to India or America to get the surgery done.
I did not have money to go abroad. I told Dr Tenabandu that. My children were very young at the time and my wife was the one who looked after all my needs. It was then that the American team of doctors visited the country. I was given the opportunity to live longer through them, he said.
The sole surviving patient of the first bypass surgery in Sri Lanka has lived a full and fruitful life. He thanks the doctors and staff of the Sri Jayawardena Hospital for having taken care of him and his long-time friend, Sarath Paranawithana for having looked after him during the whole time he was in hospital.

High interest rates taking toll on SME sector - SLCSMI
The small and medium business sector too is having a negative impact due to the bond issue, said President Sri Lanka Chamber of Small and Medium Industries, (SLCSMI) Mohideen Carder.
Speaking to Daily News Business he said due to the Bond issue banks were forced to increase interest rates and as a result its no longer practical to look at bank borrowing for reinvestment or for new ventures.
The interest rate which was around 11% has now shot up to almost 18% and the SME sector borrowings for investment are now not practical. The current interest rate is higher than the rates that were offered during conflict times, he pointed out.
Asked if the Rs 12 billion plus amount could be recalled from Perpetual Treasuries and put back to the system would help the banking sector, he said it would. This would help the banks to lower the interest rates to a certain extent.
He also said that though there are low interest loans that were being offered by State banks, when the SME sector applied for them the answer they get was that they have already been given out. The government must try to provide more finances to State banks to offer more low interest credit to SME sector, Carder said.
He also said that today under the guise of the BOI tag companies get various tax holidays and other incentives. However the SME sector does not get such benefits and this area to should be addressed.
The SLCSMI President also said that foreign aided funds too gets dried up soon and they are mostly taken by large corporate.
SMEs generate over 30% of employment and contributes more than 70% to Sri Lankas GDP. It also contributes significantly to the export sector in the country. Therefore, it is clear that promoting a sustainable and viable SME sector is essential in the nations development and growth.
However we do not anticipate a major contribution from the SME sector to the local economy this year due to some of these issues, he predicted.
Commenting on the recently inked Singapore Sri Lanka FTA Carder said that the Chamber favored it. We think that this FTA would lead to move foreign direct investments to Sri Lanka especially from foreign firms that are based in Singapore.
The Chamber also said that they also expect that there would be some contracts offered to the SME sector from Chinese companies in the Hambantota Port.

IASL ready to celebrate lifes superheroes
The Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL), declared the commencement of the Life Insurance Sales Awards 2018 at a media conference held recently. The review period for the awards, which were previously limited to the Insurance month of September, has been upgraded to cover the whole year from 2018 onwards.
The Life Insurance Industry Sales Awards was initiated in 2017 and is implemented in 2018 with the aim to raise the standard of Insurance sales professionalism, recognize and reward the performance and potential of Insurance Sales Professionals, and improve the penetration level of the Life Insurance market in Sri Lanka. The expansion of the review to a yearlong period will be a driving force for the Insurance sales professionals.
Insurance sales is often a challenging profession, the true nature of the Insurance sales personnel requires one to be trustworthy and understanding of clients needs, going beyond a mere sale of a policy. It accounts for grasping the individual expectations of each policyholder. The Life Insurance Sales Awards are designed in a way that these characteristics, along with the personality of the Advisors, soft skills and talents are enhanced, and turn around the perception of Insurance Sales as a profession; the true superheroes in Life Insurance.
The awards presented will be The Best Advisor, The Best Supervisor/Team or Unit Leader and The Best Branch Manager under the categories of Life Insurance Sales Category Winner and Life Insurance Sales National Winner. Reviewed under several benchmarks, the awards will give an opportunity for nominees to be highlighted in their careers and build a strong professional personality which will enable them to perform better as Lifes Superheroes, who they truly are.
This is the latest of many initiatives undertaken by the IASL in its endeavors to increase the penetration of Insurance as a whole in the country. In the recent past, the IASL was able to have the Cabinet of Ministers declare the 1st of September each year as the National Insurance Day and a commemorative stamp was launched in September last year.
Further, various initiatives are conducted from time to time in order to spread the concept of Insurance and also to enlighten the general public of the option of taking to Life Insurance sales which is in fact a very lucrative and promising profession.
Asbestos is in fact a set of six naturally occurring silicate minerals, which comes under two contrasting groups viz. Serpentine and Amphibole. Serpentine group consists of only Chrysotile, while Amphibole group comprises Crocidolite, Amosite, Anthophyllite, Tremolite, and Actinolite.
While other varieties of asbestos have ceased to exist in the commercial world, Chrysotile continues to be used by 150 countries across the world including the USA, and is used by two thirds of the world populace.
Due to the growing concerns raised by various factions on the use of asbestos, representatives of the world's major Chrysotile exporting mines signed an agreement, where they pledged to supply Chrysotile fibre only to those companies that demonstrate compliance with national health and safety regulations. Accordingly, the International Chrysotile Association devised the specific standards, technologies, and work methods pertaining to the relevant compliance, and this is collectively known as the controlled-use of Chrysotile.
According to the recommendations of the WHO experts, the controlled-use of Chrysotile allows the continued use of Chrysotile in high-density products that comply with the permissible exposure limit of 0.1f/cc or below.
Furthermore, following the discovery of carcinogenic properties in Amphibole (Blue) Asbestos, both epidemiologically and toxicologically, Amphibole is no longer used for commercial purpose. A convention held by the WHO in 1989 convening international experts further declared to prohibit the use of these varieties of asbestos; however, it further allowed the controlled and regulated use of Chrysotile within the permissible exposure limit of 0.1fiber/ml in the workplace.
Sri Lankan scenario on asbestos
Locally, the term Asbestos is hackneyed and synonymous with the roofing sheets.Sri Lanka only uses Chrysotile (white asbestos), which is very much less hazardous in comparison to Amphibole varieties.
Sri Lanka began manufacturing Chrysotile fibre cement roofing sheets since 1954, and even after a lapse of seven decades Chrysotile roofing sheets by far surpass their major counterparts in terms of quality, durability and affordability traits.
Key advantages of using Chrysotile roofing sheets
A Chrysotile fibre cement roofing sheet contains only 8% of Chrysotile fibres, while the remaining 92% is made of cement and water. A thin layer of Chrysotile fibres is tightly encapsulated within a matrix of high density cement mixture, leaving no room for Chrysotile fibres to be exposed.
These roofing sheets have a number of advantages over its competitors. One of the key distinctive features of Chrysotile cement roofing sheets is its strength, resulting from the strong bonds created between Chrysotile fibres and cement. Studies have shown thatthe tensile strength of Chrysotile cement roofing sheet is higher than that of steel. Chrysotile roofing sheets are not only heat, fire and electric resistant, but are also chemically neutral, producing no detectable odour.
Since Chrysotile is a natural mineral, the roofing sheets do not cause any harm to the environment. Furthermore, Chrysotile fibres do not permeate through soil, and are not soluble in water, hence they do not pollute water or change the pH level of water. And unlike other roofing products, Chrysotile cement roofing sheets do no crumble into fragments when removed or discarded.
Chrysotile roofing sheets do not require special protective coating, and also possess the ability to withstand inclement weather as well as strong winds. Due to its robustness and unique strength, Chrysotile cement roofing sheets have more than 50 years of durability. The material is not only soundproof but also non-flammable, making it an ideal and safe roofing solution for residences, enterprises as well as plants.

ICTA empowers import export control department
Facilitating trade is key to enhance a countrys standing in the global economy and improve overall competitiveness. Over the years, Sri Lanka has taken various initiatives to simplify and rationalise procedural complexities for both imports and exports putting in place effective mechanisms.
The Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) in collaboration with the Import and Export Control Department (IECD) recently developed an online license issuing and debiting system to further simplify and accelerate procedures.
Via the system importers/exporters can now apply for an Import / Export license, debit note or an amendment online and the department records will be updated accordingly.
The new online portal was launched by Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrema and State Minister of International Trade, Sujeewa Senasinghe and in the presence of other government officials.
Addressing the gathering, State Minister Senasinghe said, As we journey towards taking this country to great heights, developing the import and export climate is paramount. The government has taken major steps to increase international trade for Sri Lanka. The IECD plays an important role in this. The department not only greatly benefits by being online but helps all those involved due to it being convenient and computerised. Especially individuals can benefit, as they do not have to personally meet people, but can proceed with their requirements online.
Additionally the government hopes to digitalise several key agencies and ensure they are interconnected. I place my thanks for all those involved in this process and as this will contribute immensely to the countrys development. We hope these improvements will result in our Ease of Doing Business reaching 70 and the momentum drive the country to great heights and increase our exports further, Minister Senasinghe added.
Prior to the launch both importers/exporters and the department faced numerous challenges including time spent on manual applications, the requirement of personally being present at the department to lodge applications and fill documentation, time lost due to tedious back and forth communication, crowded offices and increasing importer complaints
As Phase One of the project, the portal provides importers/exporters easy access to information, lodging of applications at ones convenience - even 24/7, quicker approvals, online receipt of import licenses, ease in monitoring the process and receiving timely email notifications.
The new system will help streamline processes, improve transparency, showcase IECDs commitment and efficiency and contribute to generate more revenue as a result of increased importer compliance levels, and also a possible increase in the volumes of imported goods as a result of reduced delays.
The new online portal offers importers/exporters a secure, user-friendly and simplified electronic process. Facilitating applications online not only reduces processing times but caters to increased efficiency and sets service standards. Our next phase to be launched soon will ensure a single window process and platform for the department to communicate with all recommendation agencies, share alerts and information and intelligence and contribute towards the countrys wider agenda for accelerating trade, said Secretary Mr Wasantha Deshapriya - MTDI.
Phase Two of the system, which is expected to be launched mid-2018 will integrate all recommendation agencies to the single window ecosystem.
To ensure a more smoother and convenient process in obtaining licenses, Phase Two will offer a single window concept, where applicants do not have to visit other agencies but submit and receive their permits through a one stop shop model.
This will include integrating the Customs procedures as well. Through the debiting and amendment process the information will then update and trigger Customs databases as well. As a result all manual procedures will no longer be required and importers/exporters can submit all requisite information via the IECD online portal. The analytical data will further assist trade officials in decision making.
Phase Two will also provide for online payments where applicants can pay the fees via credit cards, bank drafts or transfers and inform the department accordingly.

Injured Mathews ruled out of Bangladesh tour
COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's limited-overs skipper Angelo Mathews has been ruled out of the rest of the Bangladesh tour due to a hamstring injury, the country's cricket board said Tuesday.
Mathews, who sustained the injury during the tri-nation ODI tournament that Sri Lanka won in Bangladesh last month, will miss the second and final Test against the hosts as well as the two subsequent T20 matches.
Mathews, 30, was recently named as Sri Lanka's captain in the shorter format until the 2019 World Cup.
But he has been beset by injuries and now faces a race against time to be fit for a T20 tri-nation tournament at home involving Bangladesh and India.
The tri-series will be played at Colombo's R Premadasa Stadium from March 8. Mathews has suffered a right hamstring tightness (and) will not take part in the two T20 matches, Sri Lanka Cricket said in a statement.
His participation in the Nidahas Trophy 2018 will be decided after an assessment of his medical conditions. Thisara Perera is likely to stand in as captain for the two T20 games in Bangladesh on February 15 and 18.
Mathews' absence from the deciding Test starting Thursday is unlikely to trouble Sri Lankan plans given their dominant batting performance in the drawn first game in Chittagong.
Sri Lanka's top-order fired in their only innings, with three of their batsmen hitting centuries including a fine 196 by Kusal Mendis to post a mammoth 713-9 declared.
Bangladesh have already indicated a change in strategy for the deciding game after adding strength to their batting by bringing in Sabbir Rahman.
Veteran left-arm spinner Abdur Razzaq is also expected to make the starting XI in Dhaka.
Bangladesh have been a dominant side at homeafter registering memorable Test wins against England and Australia in the 2016-17 season.
Their only Test win against Sri Lanka came in their landmark 100th Test in Colombo, when the visitors drew the two-match series 1-1.
Former captain Mushfiqur Rahim, who scored 92 in the first Test in Chittagong, said the team had every chance to win the series 1-0.
In the last Test, bowlers did not get the purchase from the wicket, that's why they could not be effective, the senior batsman said Tuesday.
Hopefully the Mirpur wicket will be different. I have full faith in our bowling department. We have good memories here as we beat both England and Australia in Dhaka, so obviously the team will be confident. AFP

Its all systems go
As the curtain comes down on the local government polls campaign at midnight today electioneering for stakes in 341 LG councils went on at a frenzied pace on the final lap, as D'day drew near.
Notably, the centre stage, in this election, was held by the big guns, firing on all cylinders, although things looked calm and quiet at ground level, the phenomenon attributed by most to the change in the electoral system that confined campaigning by each candidate to his own neck of the woods.
This certainly is a welcome departure from the situation that prevailed under the PR system where a candidate had to cover an entire electorate at huge financial cost and also lending itself to both intra party and inter party rivalry resulting in violent outcomes.
Absent also in his election is the cacophony associated with past elections where campaigning intruded into the calm and quiet of daily existence of the ordinary folk.
Be that as it may, the whole electoral exercise, this time around, involved much higher stakes than that which obtains at a local government election in the ordinary course of events. For the first time the electorate is confronted with a three cornered battle fought in earnest by the UNP, SLFP/UPFA and the SLPP following the latter's split with the Blues. The JVP, too, has emerged as a not insignificant force at this election though it is doubtful it can give the major parties a run for their money, this time around too.
The SLPP of Prof. G. L. Peiris, who, obviously is acting as proxy for Mahinda Rajapaksa, has converted this local government election into a national referendum and is urging the voters to consider the larger national picture vis-a-vis the sale of state assets, attempts to divide the country through a new constitution and the bond issue, as enunciated also by Mahinda Rajapaksa and his Joint Opposition bandwagon.
This is in contrast to its strongly held view a few moons ago that the reasons for the increase in dengue, the accumulation of garbage and general state of disarray and neglect seen in the towns and villages was due to the government's willful delay in holding local government elections for three years. This has now being put on the back burner, with the fast moving events on the national scene seized on by the pohottuwites to garner votes.
It is doubtful though if these issues will help sway the voter in the way anticipated by the pohottuwa stalwarts. Into the bargain we have the pohottuwites hammering on the slogan that this election will be the stepping stone for the return of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister. Others say this election will be the first salvo fired to send home the Yahapalanaya government.
The people in the towns and villages have until 2020 for this to happen, if at all, and they would not be looking forward to such a lengthy period for their woes in their localities to be attended through the allocation of state funds to the elected local councils. Both, the President, and, the Prime Minister, has, in not so many words said that only those councils controlled by the government will be allocated funds to carry out development work. One recalls the same injunction being made by late President D. B. Wijetunga on a local government election campaign on behalf of the UNP, henda thiyenne apey athe, the ladle is in our hand. Some may question the propriety of such statements, based on the argument that what is allocated are state funds, and also the will of the people ought to be respected.
However such nitty gritty, more often than not, are lost on the ordinary folk who may feel more secure voting for the government in power and enjoy it's largess.
Besides, the voters in the towns and the villages will be casting their ballot for locals who are familiar faces apey miniha. Mahinda Rajapaksa and other leaders will be furthest from the minds of the voters in an election of this nature, where local dynamics come into play.
Hence, MR and his acolytes may be barking up the wrong tree by asking the public to vote against the government to register their protests against the bond issue or sale of national assets which are matters far removed from the ken of ordinary folk.
In any event, the government should take cognizance of the results of this LG election and take steps to move forward in implementing the pledges made to the people. It should also take measures to address the rising cost of living and continue in earnest the development programmes that have taken a back seat due to the current election campaign. A decision will also have to be taken on the continuation of the Unity Government. Like the Prime Minister said, during a television interview on Monday, it is not possible for the SLFP to form a government of its own, since the UNP wields the majority. Hence, the status quo will have to continue after the poll.

Lanka-Singapore FTA  to brwing multiple benefits
 Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Sri Lanka President Maithripala Sirisena witness the signing of the free trade agreement by S. Ishwaran Singapores Minister of Trade and Sri Lankas Malik Samarawickrama Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade. 
On 23 January 2018, Sri Lanka marked a significant watershed in the development of its economy when 
it signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore after 18 months of negotiations between the trade negotiation teams of both countries. 
It was a giant leap in terms of implementation and laying down of a marker that the government of Sri Lanka is moving into a new era of international trade. Three Singapore companies also sealed deals with Sri Lankan partners at a business forum held the day after the signing of the FTA. There were four agreements signed for new projects across food, aquaculture, hospitality and infrastructure. Singapore SME Food Studio will set up and operate premium food courts in some Sri Lankan malls, while aquaculture business Ark Holdings will build and operate a crab farm. 
Although the main thrust of FTAs is to reduce or eliminate trade barriers and increase trade, the recently signed Sri Lanka Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) has a larger message as it signals to the world that Sri Lanka is open for business, including investments. The two island nations are also the ideal hubs  Sri Lanka for South Asia and Singapore for South East Asia. 
A key factor in the success of negotiating Trade Agreements is an understanding of the underlying needs and constraints of the other side and working to develop mechanisms to meet those needs. The complexity of trade procedures and market access rules do not necessarily have to be a hindrance but can instead be viewed as opportunities for innovative solutions. 
The agreement shall enter into force on the 1st day of 2nd month, following the date which parties exchange written notification certifying that they have completed their respective applicable legal requirements and procedures for the entry into force of this agreement. The domestic process will be completed within about 4 weeks time. 
Key features of SLSFTA 
Wider Scope; The SLSFTA is comprehensive in scope in that it covers Goods, Services, Investments, SPS/TBT, Rules of Origin, Intellectual Property rights, Customs Procedure & Trade Facilitation, Government Procurement, Competition, Trade Remedies, Economic & Technical Cooperation, Transparency Provisions, Dispute Settlement, and General & Final Provisions while it includes chapters on Telecommunications, E-commerce and Financial Services annex. 
Tariff liberalization with relatively long adjustment period; Sri Lanka agreed to eliminate customs duty of 80% out of 7,042 tariffs lines keeping 20% in the negative list which will not be subjected to reduction or elimination. In terms of tariffs reduction modality Sri Lanka will remove customs duty on 50% of Tariffs lines currently duty free on entry into force, 15% from 1-6 year, and another 15% from 7-12 year. Furthermore, revenue sensitive items such as petroleum products, cigarettes, alcohol beverages and spirits will be in the negative list. While Sri Lanka will include many agricultural products and domestic industry sensitive items in the negative list, 50 lines which includes steel products, paint products, spare parts, plastic products, electronics products, printed books, and cosmetic items will be phased out only from 11 to the 15 year. The CESS and PAL will be eliminated over a period of five years starting from fifth to the tenth year. 
Determine products of Singapore origin; All goods under the agreement have to fulfil general rules of origin of 35% domestic value addition (DVA) or a change of tariff headings (CTH at 4 digit HS level). For some export products, specific process rules will apply. The Rules of Origin (ROO) is pivotal to prevent market access provided through and tariffs liberalization programme is not misused and only Goods originating in Singapore with sufficient value addition or processing will qualify for duty concession. 
Limited service liberalization; Trade in Services is negotiated on a positive list basis, where Sri Lanka specifies the extent of liberalization, the level of restrictions, and any other conditions for the supply of Singaporean services in the sectors Sri Lanka chooses to make commitments in. In the case of Sri Lankas offers to Singapore in the Services Chapter, there is no new liberalization beyond what is already available through the prevailing unilateral regime as defined in the exchange control regulations, investment regulations, immigration regulations etc. The primary objective of the chapter is to provide commitment, transparency, and certainty to the level of liberalization in the listed sectors. 
Sri Lanka has made no commitments in the independent Movement of Natural Persons or Mode 4. However, Business Visitors are allowed entry for a period of up to 30 days, subject to immigration requirements. This would facilitate business visits to develop trade and investment linkages between the two countries. 
Entry is also permitted for intra-corporate transferees  where a Singaporean company with an investment in a committed service sector in Sri Lanka will be allowed to send senior management and specialised skilled workers to support that investment on a temporary basis.

Love not  so blind
Bennett Rathnayakes newest film Nela is scheduled to be screened from February in the CEL circuit. Nela is based on Marianela originally written by the Spanish novelist Benito Perez Galdos in the beginning of the 20th century. The story has been translated into Sinhala as Nela by Indrani Ratnasekera.
Rathnayake is the director of award-winning films Aswesuma, Sulanga and Ira Handa Yata. Some of his films have been recognised at international award ceremonies. The director himself has written the screenplay of Nela.
Nela revolves around wealthy Sri Lankan Zoysa family who pioneered owning and managing Tea estates by the locals in the dawn of the 20th century, just after the Colonial era.
George, the only child in Zoysa family, is blind from his birth. At his tender age, he loses his mother. A damsel called Nela, being an orphan living on the same estate with a Tamil family, develops an affectionate attachment with George in his budding young age, despite his disability.
Nela had met with a fatal accident as an infant that has left her with scars and bruises on one side of her body including the face. Within her mind, Nela is quite comfortable with Georges blind nature, as she thinks that her true physical state might lead him to dump her.
A doctor who comes to the estate on an invitation from the senior Zoysa cures George. In the midst of this scenario, Georges beautiful cousin arrives at the estate bungalow to look after him. Events take a dramatic turn afterwards.
Bennett Rathnayake, a fine film craftsman, has adopted a different presentation style for the film. The scenic beauty of the hill country, coupled with wonderful casting, brings an unsullied treat for the audience.
Casting for the movie has been done brilliantly. Performances of Thumindu Dodantenna as the doctor and Udari Perera as Nelas young mother (before her demise) are excellent. Thumindu Dodantenna on horseback looks very similar to the Hollywood actor Donald Sutherland and his performance is, of course, par excellence.
The picturesque beauty of the surroundings and performances of actors are captured well by the camera. The director has made use of his prowess as an experienced and technically qualified filmmaker. With Nela, Ratnayake proves his mettle once again.
Nela is going to be a rare treat for the audiences.

Over three million voters with restricted ability!
Make the disability vote count
On February 10, 15.8 million Sri Lankans will be eligible to elect 8,293 members to 24 municipal councils, 41 urban councils and 276 divisional councils.
Colossal economic and social wastes plague the country in untold proportions.
It is thus imperative for all local government bodies to identify root causes and enforce a plan of remedial action.
Two prerequisites here are: (i). Arresting the waste of human talent and instead of mobilizing this asset and (ii). Minimising unwanted dependency through inclusion, empowering and equal opportunity.
Almost all of us will spend some of our time living with a deficiency in ability: moving, seeing, physical coordination, etc.
Sri Lanka has a fastest ageing population -16% of it will soon be over 65 years. A wide and diverse range of our population - at least 20% -continue to cry louder over twenty years concerning their marginalisation, social exclusion and SAFETY and thereby loss of dignity and productive opportunities in day-to-day life. On March 30, 2007, Sri Lanka signed the UN Convention for the protection of the rights of dis-Abled persons.
Accessibility is a key HUMAN RIGHTS issue and one of the eight pillars on which this convention stands.
Waste of human talent
Mayors and local council must recognise and respect: Accessibility for All is not an option but indispensable.
Practices in issuing certificates of conformity by local government bodies concerning all parts of buildings the public needs to use in daily life, often, still, violate the Supreme Court orders of April 27, 2011.
Such injurious action is not only a violation of a human rights issue and non-compliance with the UN Convention but also end-up DIS-ABLING society  a major setback to the mega-polis agenda.
Mayoral and other candidates must realise the colossal waste of human talent and potential - the countrys greatest resource - through exclusion.
They also must implement fast track, plans for complying with the legislation that all members of Parliament have unanimously approved on 20th March 2007.
The result of injurious actions naming a few.
None of the rooms and ballrooms in many 5 star hotels and not a single ward in just opened hospitals, even in Colombo, amazingly have NOT EVEN ONE ACCESSIBLE TOILET!
Even in Mega-polis territories, hardly any ATM machines, Supermarkets, Educational institutions, Sports complexes and mushrooming glamorous posh Restaurants can be accessed and used even by those ambulant and affected by debilitating medical conditions.
Victims here are the eligible voters and their ability restricted children-not fewer than three (3) Million in number -the inevitable accidents, numerous debilitating medical conditions, wear & tear of the body, etc., and the ended 30 years of war, have robbed of their abilities to see, walk, climb or even stand steadily, to a greater or lesser extent, permanently or temporarily.
Rights of voters to enjoy for education, employment, shopping, recreation, tourism and travel, therefore are often denied by local government bodies - overlooking their legal obligations and social responsibility. Often these critical shortcomings also pose safety hazards. More than one in six voters is thus often unable by themselves to ensure for themselves the necessities of day-to-day life.
But, still, rightly built facilities could reverse this trend to a significant degree!
The malady of forgetting the largest minority.
A Mayor elected on 10th February shall be the leader of that local body. There are also the organisers appointed by top leaders of all main political parties.
Indeed it is a national tragedy that hardly any of these 8,293 men and women seeking our votes to be our leaders of tomorrow, see this countrys largest minority group a huge voting base when their families are also added.
The measures required to comply with legislation are low cost and easily feasible.
As violators of SC orders are often backed by political powers, local government bodies shamelessly tend to succumb and allow violators to go free; the victims must either plead and earn the good-will of violators or suffer further!
Eye-opener points for NEW local government bodies
* The Supreme Court has recognised the unlawful playing with precious human life causing safety hazards.
They have ruled that failure to refrain from issuing certificates of conformity where there is anything less than full compliance with its 2011 April orders shall be considered as a serious punishable offence attracting punitive repercussions, including for Mayors and Commissioners.
Please note any violation through failure for compliance, Supreme Court gives the liberty for anyone to file a motion under its given order SCFR 221/2009.
* Access for all really means Access to Justice which can no more be delayed under a true and truthful good governance!
n Local bodies should respect the fact that: The way a country treats its dis-Abled population is an internationally recognized measure of a countrys good governance and a far more telling indicator of societys development than GDP.
* The Mayor and his/her team, on a high priority basis, should establish a workable mechanism for the effective enforcement and implementation of legislation to prevent issuing of C.O.Cs to facilities failing to comply totally.
It is equally crucial to make the public clearly aware of such measures in advance.
* New and renovated buildings (even on rent or lease)  toilets in particular - the newly elected local government bodies should immediately be looking at for compliance, includes following essential facilities the public need to use in daily life:
All Star Hotels and places of tourist attractions, Restaurants, Institutions of secondary and tertiary education and vocational training, wards and counters in hospitals, banks, sports stadia, all Government and private sector facilities at up-coming cities, towns, basic urban infrastructures and; services - including train and bus facilities - within MEGA-POLIS and Port City territories.
* Business leaders should be reminded of the fact: Safety and Inclusion of all customers by physical design is paramount for the growth of businesses and to maximize its potential.
* In working closely with the Ministry of Tourism, the star-status awarding procedures to hotels must be remedied immediately making compliance with accessibility legislation  not in bits and pieces but - in total-mandatory.
We witness fast growing ability restrict ed senior touring populations of the world demand their right to equal access.
With their high spending potential, they are an unrecognized but growing niche - certainly an overlooked growth market here. But that requires tourist establishments and essential facilities truly meeting accepted design standards.
Hence, accessibility in tourism, all hoteliers must be re-told, is an indispensable economic element.
* Most of the accident victims continue to find physical access to courts a nightmare. Therefore local government bodies should ensure all new and renovated Court Complexes comply with Supreme Court Orders for accessibility.
* To make these crucial initiatives a meaningful reality, at least Municipal Councils must enforce a system of independent physical audits and checks to establish compliance with accessibility legislation.
Expert Accessibility Advisors  the missing link
Accessibility experts perform a highly responsible specialised job, involving money, time and effort concerning precious human life.
It requires a good in-depth understanding of intricacies, years of practical experience and thorough working knowledge beyond text-book material.
It is not one where standards and specifications can just be read and applied.
Looking at reality proves that, the absence of the services of experienced accessibility experts is a very costly blunder that fuels social exclusion and loss of business opportunities and good name.
Fervent last hope
We still hope that this article will be an 11th-hour eye opener to all Mayoral Candidates and their teams. May they make clear public announcements indicating proposed plan of action on fast track so that for the increasing biggest minority group of voters, the degree of their mobility should no more be a disadvantage caused by physical and architectural barriers and thereby everyday activities should no more become a daunting task to accomplish
Remember, although the largest minority, they have NO VOICE in Parliament or even in local government bodies to be formed. At least all Municipal Councils should have one independent council member a dis-Abled - appointed by the Mayor based on merit, towards rectifying this major shortcoming.

Modelling agency only hires models Over 45
In our young-and-sexy obsessed society, it has become all too easy to overlook the beauty and glamour of those who are aging gracefully. While Hollywood is busy air-brushing, botoxing and face-lifting in a vain attempt to hold back the inevitable march of time, this Russian modelling agency has decided instead to embrace the beauty of ageing in a series of gorgeous photos.
Appropriately named Oldushka, the agency represents models from the age of 45 and above, going up to 85 in some cases. While the fashion industry finally seems to be getting to grips with diversity in model sizes and ethnicity, age is the next barrier to be broken down.
The agency was born from photographer Igor Gavars project, which captured the style of retirees for his blog, also called Oldushka. The vast majority of the models on their books are over 60, with only the male model, Sergey, coming in at a youthful 45. I signed him because he is older than he looks, Gavar told Vogue in an interview.
Oldushkas older models are getting plenty of work in Russia, appearing in more mainstream catalogues and advertising campaigns, and bringing a whole new generation into the fashion industry. Will it inspire other countries to do likewise and embrace the glamorous side of ageing Lets see shall we.

Measures would be taken to make the National Economic Council (NEC) a permanent institution through an Act of Parliament (AoP), enabling it to continue its operations without changing from government to government, NEC Secretary-General and Chief Economist Professor Lalith P. Samarakoon said.
During a media briefing held at the Presidential Secretariats media division, yesterday, Prof. Samarakoon said that the NEC is the last stop before the Cabinet and functions as a filtering body.
According to him, the decisions taken by the Cabinet of Ministers, and the proposals submitted to the Cabinet Committee, have to be referred to the NEC for advice and observations before seeking final Cabinet approval.

No Lankan will be sent to electric chair - President
No Sri Lankan will be sent to the electric chair during my tenure, assured President Maithripala Sirisena.
The President was addressing UPFA supporters at a rally held in Hakmana last evening.
The President gave this assurance in response to the fear allayed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa while attending a television programme the previous day that he still feared of being destined to the electric chair.
Matara is famous for its contribution to the countrys economy and its high percentage of intellectuals who have gained national and international fame. As a result in the past eight decades, Matara has been in the fore front of producing leftist as well as progressive political leadership, President Sirisena said.
During the past three years, I have not permitted a single square inch of this country to be sold to any foreign country and only agreed to lease land, the President said. Accordingly, I had the Port City agreement be amended. I take this opportunity to assure you that it will be the Sri Lanka Freedom Party that will safeguard the nations sovereignty in the future,the President said.
There was an allegation that I retrenched over 400 staff attached to the Presidential Secretariat after I assumed duties. The truth is that of the over 1600 persons attached to the Presidential Secretariat, around 400 only visited the place to draw their salary. They were not laid off but assigned to other ministries as the Presidential Secretariat was over staffed. I also ensured that all casual workers were given permanent appointments It is a democratic right of the people to criticize government decisions. During the past three years, there have been no state sponsored murders or disappearances, no fear of white vans, no journalists having to leave the country, no newspapers editors murdered on the streets nor were any media institutions set ablaze,the President said.
I trust that you will vote for the SLFP, the UPFA and other parties in our alliance to help create new nation free of corruption and fraud. You have the opportunity to do so on February 10th.
Fisheries Minister and State Minister for Mahaweli Development Mahinda Amaraweera, State for Enterprise Development Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena and Provincial Minister for Eduction Chandima Rasaputhra were among those who addressed the rally.

What they have asked for is not unfair. They are usually given a salary increment of 25% to 30% once in three years, the NWS&DB General Mnager Engineer D.U.Sumanasekara said.
We have accepted their demands and are willing to give them a 25% salary increase, Sumanasekara said.

PARLIAMENT
Duty of all to wipe out corruption - Deputy Minister Alagiyawanna
Deputy Minister of Finance and Mass Media Lasantha Alagiyawanna said it is irrelevant if anyone is an old rogue or a new rogue, and the responsibility is vested in Parliament to ensure that such debates never happen again and corruption is wiped out from this country.
Joining the debate on the Bond and PRECIFAC report in Parliament yesterday, Alagiyawanna said corruption, wrong doing and fraud should be wiped out from this country permanently.
Especially as the SLFP, we have unpleasant experiences. In 2015 most of us within the party worked for the victory of Mahinda Rajapaksa. However, the people rejected him. Various people interpret this defeat in numerous ways. But we have done a self-assessment of why we lost. We too humbly admit that we are also stakeholders in this defeat. 
He said that is the reason that they are committed to wiping out corruption from this country and have embraced a clean political path under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Hence today the whole country is working unitedly towards the eradication of corruption and fraud. At this point we too have a responsibility of not expecting any political gain through this endeavour. We have to face and have seen various media reports which sometimes is very saddening, he said.
Having completed the investigations into the Bond and serious crimes report, we must understand our responsibility as Parliamentarians, he noted.
Alagiyawanna said the Bond Commission had requested for extensions, but then there were allegations levelled that the government was trying to hide the Bond report and safeguard the perpetrators.
Then even a few days before they were arrested, the government came under criticism that the bond scam perpetrators would never be arrested.
Yet we must endure all this criticism and still move in the right direction.
He also noted that the laws within the Central Bank needs to be revised, to prevent such occurrences in the future.
The Deputy Minister noted that the government needs to ensure that such fraud and corrupt activities are never repeated in this country ever again as it is their responsibility as public servants.
SLFP does not agree to remove any persons civic rights:Amaraweera
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party ( SLFP) does not agree to remove any persons civic rights, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera in Parliament yesterday.
Minister Amaraweera made this observation, joining the Adjournment Motion moved on the Bond Commission and PRECIFAC report by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He said that the SLFP had a bitter experiences when the civic rights of late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike was removed. He added that due to that reason, it did not need to get involved in a similar exercise.
Wrong doers could be dealt with by law, Minister Amaraweera said. Parliament could amend laws to enable the judiciary to take tougher action on wrong doers.
Minister Amaraweera further said that the Presidential Commission on the Bond issue was never appointed targeting the UNP, though some attempted to make it seem so.
He added that the Presidential Commission also appointed to look into Srilankan and Mihin Lanka would deal with those involved in destroying the national economy no matter whether they belong to the previous government or the present regime.
He added that it was he that made the complaint regarding this Bond issue.
Treasury bond issue could not be swept under carpet: Wimal
The Treasury Bond fraud could not be swept under the carpet by highliting other frauds, said Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Wimall Weerawansa yesterday. He said such frauds should be dealt separately. He also said that the Treasury Bond fraud was even worse than all the other frauds put altogether.
He made this observation while joining the Adjournment debate on the Bond Commission report and on the Presidential Commission report on Serious Crimes and Abuse of Power ( PRECIFAC) moved by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
MP Weerawansa said that this was an organised crime that would affect the economy of the country as a whole. He added that the Central Bank was taken out of the Finance Ministrys control. He questioned as to why Arjuna Mahendran who was a non Sri Lankan was appointed the Central Bank Governor. He was a person who pumped funds for the election of this government. Had the previous mechanism been used to the bond issuance, such frauds would not have been able to be committed. So they changed the previous procedure. DEW Gunasekaras COPE report was not allowed to be released. State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe wrote a book on it and later he was appointed to the Cope Committee. They attempted to conceal it.
Using Parliamentary privileges to slander national heroes unethical:Bandula
Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena said using parliamentary privileges any minister or MP could attack or slander any national hero, but it was not ethical and should not be encouraged. This is not something that happenes in a developed and civilized Parliament, he said.
He made this statement in Parliament yesterday, during the debate on the Bond Commission report and PRECIFAC report in Parliament yesterday.
He said since the period we were under foreign rule, our national heroes were slated and slandered and publicly executed in many instances, but today, we have erected monuments in their honour and we honour them as heroes.
At present, a new trend in attacking our national heroes have commenced since January 2015. The heroes who saved our country from separatist terrorists, intelligence officers and leaders who gave leadership to this struggle are being pursued and attacked.
Therefore, this is not something to be amused about. This happens from century to century. Hence, we are ready to face any such attack, he said.Gunawardena noted that during the terror reign of the LTTE, many of our innocent citizens were slaughtered indiscriminately, while great national leaders were killed in a most demeaning manner. It was former leaders of the previous regime that took on the challenge bravely and rid the country of terrorism.
But unfortunately, we live in a country that puts such people to low levels and attacks them in the lowest possible manner.
This is our misfortune to have to represent such a Parliament in this country.
He said during the previous Premadasa era, tax payers money was doled out to the terrorists directly from the Treasury through Paskaralingam. I am tabling these receipts.
On August 09, 1989, Rs. 05 million was paid out under his signature, 0n September 15, Rs. 05 million and so on. Now this is the sort of person who is the main advisor to the Prime Minister. Where is Paskaralingam today
He noted that many prominent leaders and news establishments had said that providing funds to terrorists was wrong. Yet they then claimed that the terrorists were provided with funds and weapons to control the JVP and the Tamil militants.
These sorts of people who provided terrorists with money and weapons are now pointing fingers at Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, claiming that they wont rest until they are sent to prison.
He challenged the government to kill him if they could as he vowed to bring the Batalanda Commission report to Parliament at the next debate.
To investigate entire period Mahendran served as CB Governor
Presidential Commission a must
Joint Opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila noted that the Bond Commission covered the period from February 01 to March 31 only. But Arjun Mahendran served as the CB Governor until June 30.
He said so in Parliament, joining the Bond Commission and PRECIFAC Report debate in Parliament yesterday.
Hence the report does not cover the additional three months. Therefore, another Presidential Commission should be appointed to investigate the entire period that Arjun Mahendran served as the CB Governor.
The profits made by Perpetual Treasuries in April 2016, was Rs. 4,120 million. In May it was Rs. 790.8 million and in June it was Rs. 409.4 million. These are extraordinary profits which is a definite indication concerning the fraudulent and illegal means they had used to earn such profits which had continued during the next three months as well.
Hence, it is only through appointing another commission to investigate how the Perpetual Treasuries earned such a hefty Rs. 5,320 million during these three months that this fraud could be exposed, he added.
He said the government that came into power on January 09, 2015, said they were here to net in rogues of the previous regime, but they committed the biggest financial theft in the country within 49 days of coming into power.
The Presidential Commission reports makes it clear that since then, from February 27, this government had been engaged in many a financial crime in the country.
Gammanpila said that the Prime Minister had brought in a foreign national and appointed him as the Central Bank Governor.
This was not just said only by me, but even the President said he was against it, but the Prime Minister had vouched for Mahendrans honesty and had agreed to take the responsibility. Therefore he wish to know what the Prime Minister intends to do now
He noted that 103 pages of the Bond Commission report was missing and the President had admitted that these pages contained sensitive information. However, today we received a CD which is said to contain these missing pages.
Further, he said Arjun Aloysius also received advantages and privileges by making use of Arjun Mahendran, as he was the CB Governor. Quoting a paragraph on page 860 of the Bond report, he said, On April 01, 2016, PTL participated at the OMO auction to borrow 22 billion at 8% to cover shortfalls of the Treasury bonds received at the auction on April 01, 2016. Further, PTL used the Intra Data facility to borrow Rs. 19.98 billion throughout the day (April 01, 2016). However, the company was unable to provide the securities to cover the required OMO auction amounting to Rs. 11.1 billion, and was fined a penalty of Rs. 7.6 million.
Change in procedure helped bond fraud -wimal
The Treasury Bond fraud cannot be swept under the carpet by highlighting other frauds, Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said yesterday.
He said those frauds should be dealt with separately. He also said that Treasury Bond fraud is worse than all the other frauds put together.
He made this observation joining the adjournment debate on the Bond commission report and on the Presidential Commission report on Serious Crimes and Abuse of Power (PRECIFAC) moved by Prime Minister Ranil Wickramesinghe. MP Weerawansa said that this was an organised crime that affected the economy of the country as a whole. He added that the Central Bank was taken out of the Finance Ministrys control. He questioned as to why Arjuna Mahendran, who was a non Sri Lankan, was appointed Central Bank Governor. He was a person who pumped funds for the election of this government.Had the previous mechanism been used in the bond issuance, this fraud could not have been commited. So they changed the previous procedure.
D.E.W Gunasekaras COPE report was not allowed to be released. State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe wrote a book on it and later he was appointed to the COPE Committee.They attempted to conceal it, Weerawansa said.
First time in countrys history, COPE report had recommended those found guilty be punished:Harsha
The Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Dr. Harsha de Silva, said for the first time in the Countrys history, a COPE report had gone this far. The COPE report had recommended that all those who were found guilty of being involved in the Bond scam be punished.
It is for the first time a COPE report came this far. I have no connection with the Arjun Aloysius or the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd., and have never met him. So, I have the courage to call a spade a spade, he said.
He noted that the CID and the Attorney Generals Department officers had the freedom to carry out their investigations independently, without any political interference.
He made this statement in Parliament yesterday, joining the Parliamentary debate on the Bond Commission report and PRECIFAC report. He denied having any connection with Arjun Aloysius or any party nor had any telephone conversation with those involved in the Bond scam. These reports bear ample testimony to that. Personally, I have engaged in ethical politics, where I am not afraid to accept what is right and stand up against what is wrong. The Deputy Minister said they never protected thieves and in fact had given the fullest support to bring the bond scam perpetrators to justice.
It was told in this House that the loss from the bond scams took place before 2015 (tape). So, according to the Bond Issuance, the Pitipana Committee came up with a report which was again identified in the CoPE report to conduct a proper investigation.
Subsequently, a COPE report was also forwarded to the Attorney General by the Office of the Leader of the House for action, though it was not evident that there was a fraud identified at that time, reports were sent for necessary action. No attempts are seen to catch smaller fish and to keep out the large.
Meanwhile, responding to a statement made by Joint Opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila, who alleged that the current Central Bank Governor Indrajith Kumaraswamy had alliances with Raj Rajaratnam who is a Sri Lankan - American former hedge fund manager and billionaire, founder of the Galleon Group and owns a luxury property in London with funds earned through this alliance, Harsha de Silva said he had contacted the CB Governor and he had denied this allegation.
Since he cannot be here personally, he wanted me to correct this misconception that he had purchased a house in London with ill earned money. During his tenure as the Secretary General of the Commonwealth, he was given a flat in that building. But now he is living in a small flat in Finchley, North WestLondon. This is utterly unfair, de Silva said.

President to withdraw  January 26 gazette
President Maithripala Sirisena should waithdraw the January 26 gazette notification on Minimum Standards for Medical Education with immediate effect, Executive Committee representative of the Parents Union of Medical Students Ashoka Ranwala said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Organization of Professionals Association (OPA) in Colombo yesterday, he said the gazette notification had been issued to influence the Supreme Court judgement to be given soon on the SAITM issue.
The minimum qualification to enter into a medical faculty should be the minimum qualification obtained by a Sri Lankan medical student to enter into a state medical faculty in the immediate previous year. It should be three (3) B passes for now, he said.
The union said they will re-commence their fast unto death again if the Government does not abolish the gazette notification and abolish SAITM as promised to the country through a public declaration.
No one is against offering a state MBBS to all qualified SAITM students through the KDU or any other state medical faculty. But the politicians who obtained millions and billions of rupees as commissions from foreign university owners are against abolishing SAITM because they cannot open any more private medical faculties in Sri Lanka if that happens, he said.

Probe into crime and corruption cases in a transparent manner- Ajith
No previous government had ever conducted any investigations in to crime and corruption as the present government has done, Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera yesterday said.
Minister Perera pointed out that those investigations followed proper procedures without applying the law of the jungle unlike the previous regime did.
Deputy Minister Perera also pointed out that the authorities have completed 145 crucial investigations on crimes, financial crimes and corruption committed during the previous regime and the present. The investigations include 95 cases by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division, 15 by the Criminal Investigation Department, 34 by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources, and Privileges (PRECIFAC) and one by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury Bond issue.
The Deputy Minister said all structural hindrances that delay judicial process in Sri Lanka will soon be done away with and legal action against persons involved in fraud and corruption would be expedited.
The government will establish three special Anti-Corruption High Courts by March along with a three Bench Trial-at-Bar to hear these cases. We are going to increasing the maximum number of High Court judges from 75 to 110 as well. We have also taken steps to recruit more counsels to the Attorney Generals Department and to resolve issues relating to their salaries. When all these changes are applied, we will be able to conclude hearing a case within two weeks. At present, it takes 17 years for a case like this to finally reach a conclusion, the very weakness used by persons involved in these crimes and corruption, Deputy Minister Perera pointed out.
Speaking of the arrest of former Russian Ambassador Udayanga Weeratunge, Deputy Minister Perera said the government will put all its effort to bring the arrested to Sri Lanka.
He also said that this arrest will shed light not only to the financial misappropriation to the tune of US$ 14 million while purchasing four Ukrainian built MIG-27 aircraft for the Sri Lanka Air Force in 2015 but possibly also into the murder of journalist Lasantha Wickremetunge.
Deputy Minister Perera also observed that the PRECIFAC report has
recommended that legal action be taken against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa, MP Namal Rajapaksa, Sarath Kumara Gunaratne, Renuka Perera, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, P.Banduwickreme and Dr.P.B.Abeysundara for their involvements in corruption.
He urged from the Attorney General and the Inspector of Police to take swift action against these persons in the same way Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena was taken into custody.
We expect the responsible authorities to take action against all those who are involved in these corruption cases, not just some selected persons.The law must be equal to all. Certain names should not delay legal action. They should not be treated differently, he said.

Queensland conquered by a Lankan
The recorded evidence of Ceylonese migrants to Australia dates back to 1816; they are, Major William ODean and Eve a Malay and his Sinhalese wife. Most of the early immigrants from Ceylon generally got mixed with Aboriginal population. Apart from this, other early incidences date back to the 1870s. Queensland authorities sought out the prospects of importing labour for work on sugar cane plantations. The first batch of Lankans to work in the State was famously branded as Cingalese, a common name for Ceylonese irrespective of racial/ethnic identities.
A population of Ceylonese origin was believed to live on Thursday Island, since the beginning of 20th century. In 1882, a group of 480 left the island for Queenslandwho landed in Mackay and Bundaberg in East coast. There were Ceylonese jewellers and pearl divers who left Galle port for Torres Strait. The collapse of the coffee industry followed by a depression and the moving out of villagers of their homelands by colonial planters motivated the Ceylonese to look for greener pastures down under.
Fortune seekers
S M Kamaldeen, writing for Sunday Times of October 15, 1978, in an article entitled,
Stranded without food Sinhalese workers named the town Badagini!he queries, Badagini of West Australia or Baddaginnie In Victoria He further says,
It is relevant to note here that during a study tour in Australia recently, the writer was pleasantly surprised to learn of a town called Badagini in West Australia. It is said that this was the place where a group of Sinhala workers had been stranded without food, to mark which event J. G. Wilmot, a surveyor under whom they served, gave the name Badagini. The columnist further inquires. Could it be that some of the Ceylonese who landed at Mackay or Bundaberg found their way to distant West Australia perhaps to join the vast hordes of fortune seekers during the gold rush
About 37 years ago, perhaps Kamaldeen with a restricted range of information network unlike today, wouldnt have made correct presumptions. The writers work on the claim on Badagini concludes that there wasnt a town by that name in Western Australia, but that the reference was to Baddaginnie in Victoria, which is a small township -190 km North-East of Melbourne and 10 km West of Benalla, on the Melbourne-Sydney rail track.
A place-name book compiled by Blake speaks of a Surveyor by the name, J. G. Wilmot who arrived with a team from Ceylon named the place Baddaginnie, for his men starving without provisions screamed We are hungry. Like in Kamaldeens, Blakes observations are controversial too.
It is hard to believe the workers travelled over 3000 km from Mackay and Bundaberg in QLD to Victoria in the 1880s; secondly, there exists a creek [stream] called Baddaginnie flowing parallel to the rail line and through the township; therefore, one could logically infer the place got the name from it after the surveying of the place in 1857.
The name Baddaginnie sounds Aboriginal; names like Lake Bungunnia, a town in Western Australia, Badgingarra, a river called Bongala; forest Bungongo. However, it would be pertinent to quote Dr Wickrema Weerasooriya, distinguished Senior Public Servant and former High Commissioner to Australia, he says, the paper carried a news item that, Mr. Wilmot, a surveyor from Ceylon, is naming places in Victoria, such as Dimbulla and Gampola.
This he says in his exhaustive research Links between Australia and Sri Lanka-1988, where he traces the origins of two Sinhala town names. Quoting Ceylon Weekly Observer-1885, he further says, The writer came across a detailed description of Dimbulla, it is a town situated 334 km north-west of Melbourne, and that previously, it was known as Nine Creeks.
The name Dimboola has generally been accepted to have come from the Sinhalese word dimbula meaning Land of Figs [Divul] also Gampola, the name of an upcountry town. Records authenticate the names came from the surveyor, John W Wilmot, who lived in Ceylon as well.
A British ship named Devonshire had left Colombo with 482 people in 1882. Apart from the 11 Malays, 8 Moors and 14 Sinhala women and eight children; the rest were Sinhalese males. There are contradictory reports on the precise date of departure Kamaldeen says, November 14, while Arthur C Dep, [former DIG] writing to Sunday Times of November 1983 says, Devonshire left on this memorable voyage in mid-September 1882.
White Australians in Bundaberg opposed the state rulers move. They banded themselves jointly into an Anti-Cooley movement; the initiative was to oppose trading in of foreign labour. The business was labelled as an invasion. Misinformation carried out by them for months caught the attention of politicians, but they ignored it as a purely a private affair and refrained from interfering.
On November 18, these groups encircled the landing area and pelted objects at Cingalese with the aim of forcing them back to the ship.
Brutal confrontation
The Cingalese in an unknown territory though refused to surrender, as an alternative, as eye-witnesses reported, at a mass gathering of over 500, the leaders of Anti-Cooley League provoked the white Australians to demonstrate. At the port, unruly scenes were seen which gradually developed into a brutal confrontation between them and agents of plantations that ordered the labour, compelling the latter to vanish from the area leaving the Cingalese stranded.
The deserted immigrants had no alternative but to respond in their own way. Being strained to resolve the state by themselves, they dragged their knives, stormed into the Australians barrier making a sharp, loud, piercing cry of ruthless and disparaging terminology both in English and Sinhala.
The whites who came upon an abrupt and unexpected occurrence in their home territory suffered an uncouth shock and in an undue swiftness, bewilderment and confusion ran helter-skelter.
The Cingalese chased the leaguers away from the sight; even caused physical harm to a few who suffered in the stampede.
As a habit 19th and early 20th century Lankans carried a short knife with a pointed blade with them. These courageous and daring men conquered Bundaberg, but later peacefully walked inland. Australians never repeated the mistake.
