'All Black zombies' party after World Cup win
Wellington went into party mode on Sunday as jubilant All Black fans celebrated New Zealand's historic World Cup final win over arch-rivals Australia.
Energetic despite a 5am (1600 GMT) kick-off, thousands of supporters poured out of pubs in the capital's Courtenay Place entertainment strip after the 34-17 victory.
Cars flying All Black flags tooted their horns as the good-natured crowd cheered, while strangers in All Black jerseys and scarves hugged on the sidewalk.
"What a day to be alive," Geordie Maxey said after New Zealand's record third World Cup victory.
"It means so much to us ordinary Kiwis. It's a testament to the great All Blacks that are retiring and I feel truly proud to be a New Zealander." Shamoon Shamoon, the manager of the Grand Hotel, said the revelry was comparable to New Year's Eve. "Wehad a full house in 15 minutes and had to close the doors... (the atmosphere) was magnificent," he said.
Due to timezone issues, the government passed special laws allowing pubs to open during the tournament, despite objections from morality groups.
Prime Minister John Key, in a congratulatory message to the team, said "four million New Zealanders would have set their alarms to get up and watch the final".
The tournament's early start took a toll on some, with Callum Cookson and Ollie Ling still wearing pancake make-up from Halloween the previous night.
"We're All Blacks zombies now... this isn't make up -- it's our real faces," Cookson joked.
"It was hard staying up, and when we weren't asleep, we were nervous. We ploughed through the night and it was totally worth it, we're winners."
- 'Rugby is what we are' -
Rhythm Hartman, enjoying a celebratory kebab, struggled to express what winning back-to-back World Cups means to the rugby-mad nation.
"It's part of our culture, it's not just a game for us, it's a bit more than that, how can you explain it" he said.
"New Zealand always loves the ABs, especially when they bring home double World Cups."
For Emma Cossar, who dragged herself out to watch the match with a broken ankle, defeating Australia made the win even sweeter.
"Rugby is what we are, it doesn't really matter about other stuff," she said.
"Most people overseas only see New Zealand as part of Australia, so it's pretty cool to be able to say we kicked the arse of every other rugby team in the world."
In Australia, the result evoked a mixture of disappointment and defiance, with fans taking heart from the fact that the Wallabies -- largely written off before the tournament -- pushed the All Blacks all the way.
Supporters ranging from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to Hollywood star Russell Crowe and golfer Greg Norman all tweeted messages telling the Wallabies to hold their heads high after an effort that had won the nation's admiration.
"Absolutely, proud of the Wallabies," fan Simon Ansell said after watching the final in a Sydney bar.
"New Zealand is an ultra-class team, I'm proud of what the Wallabies did, we'll be back in four years' time."
- 'Greatest ever seen' -
The atmosphere in Wellington was more tense 80 minutes earlier, amid fears the Wallabies could stage an upset. The crowd at the D4 Irish bar watched the pre-match haka in absolute silence, letting out a collective roar when it was finished. Every crunching tackle was met with applause by patrons enjoying pints of beer and fried breakfasts, with one spectator tempting fate by saying "it's in the bag" as the All Blacks raced to a 16-3 half-time lead.
But a few streets away at the Four Kings bar, tensions mounted after the restart amid a stirring Australian fightback.
Smiles only began reappearing after Dan Carter's drop goal provided a handy buffer, then the bar erupted when Beauden Barrett's late try put the result beyond doubt.Chants of "All Blacks, All Blacks" erupted as Queen's "We are the Champions" blared over the sound system.
New Zealand Herald rugby writer Gregor Paul said it was a win that sealed the current All Blacks' place in history. "Who could mount any kind of counter viewpoint against Richie McCaw's team being the greatest the game has ever seen" he wrote.

All Blacks heroes hail their greats
For a team that has achieved rugby's Everest, the All Blacks were quick to dampen any overt excitement after beating Australia 34-17 in the World Cup final.
As far as New Zeland captain Richie McCaw was concerned, the All Blacks came into the tournament as world champions and were expected to play like that.
He described his emotion at the end of Saturday's final at Twickenham as "warm inside and proud of the men I've been in battle with".
Accolades for the All Blacks flooded in as soon as the final whistle went, led by beaten Wallaby coach Michael Cheika.
"New Zealand won fair and square and have been the form team since the last World Cup," Cheika said. The All Blacks had not only became the first side to win consecutive World Cups, they were also the first team to win the crown three times.
They have been the world's top-ranked side since 2009 and British bookmakers cannot see that changing soon as they have already installed the New Zealanders as even-money favourites to win the 2019 tournament in Japan.
Steve Hansen made winning the World Cup a focus as soon as he took over as New Zealand head coach after their 2011 success.
But he said after the mission was completed, that win, lose or draw, what mattered most to him was that the team enjoyed themselves.
"I think there's a lot of people have realised we are not big bad ogres that sometimes we are printed to be in the media," he said.
"We are just ordinary people who can play rugby reasonably well. Life's too short not to have fun. If you're serious all the time it's pretty boring."
But Hansen was effusive about the contribution of his retiring stars led by Dan Carter, and possibly 34-year-old McCaw who is undecided about his future.
Test centurions Keven Mealamu, Tony Woodcock and Ma'a Nonu are also stepping away from internationals as is centre Conrad Smith, a veteran of 94 Tests.
McCaw "is the greatest All Black we've ever had, and Dan's a close second," Hansen said.
"The only thing that separates them is one's a flanker (McCaw) and shouldn't play 148 Test matches. As a flanker that's unheard of.
"There was a lot of talk going into this game about the loose forward trio," he said in reference to Wallabies David Pocock, Michael Hooper and Scott Fardy.
- Leader -
"Without wanting to be disrespectful to the other guys who I thought played really well, I thought our trio won that battle and Rico was the leader of our trio."
McCaw, who has indicated retirement is close, is the world's most capped player and most successful captain, leading his team to a near 90 percent win rate.
He said his major motivation was to ensure when he does leave he has added something to the number seven jersey.
"No person is bigger than what the team is and your job is to enhance and add something to that legacy," he said.
"One thing I've always been big on is it's not so much being a hero every week, it's just doing your job as best you can to serve the team."
McCaw also led the All Blacks to victory in the 2011 World Cup when they beat France 8-7 in Auckland. "It wa just a massive relief four years ago," he said referring to the national expectation in rugby-obsessed New Zealand to end a 24-year wait for a second World Cup title to add to their triumph, again on home soil, at the inaugural 1987 edition. "This was an opportunity we really wanted to take," McCaw explained. AFP

[APPRECIATIONS - (02-09-2015)]
Kirthi Sri Karunaratne:
The king reigns no more
And indeed that is exactly what Kirthi was - the king of Sri Lanka's fashion world where he reigned and held court for more than three score years and ten.
Kirthi Sri Karunaratne is no more but he leaves a legacy of not just fashion and trends which he created, but memories that his thousands of friends will cherish, of Kirthi the Man, not the Fashion Guru and Fashion Icon that he was often termed!
A gentleman to his finger tips, generous to a fault, simple and humble in demeanour all his life, a sincere and loving friend, a master chef; while his home was always home to his many friends; Kirthi was a man in a million!
"It all began with sketching and turning out clothes, mostly for my mother and cousins while still at school in Ananda College, aiming to be a doctor," said Kirthi reminiscing on his career in fashion over a cup of tea with me some years ago.
A career which spanned over three score years and ten, no mean feat ! In fact even a few months ago, no sooner he had returned home from hospital I asked him if he would be well enough to do me a sari for a wedding and his response was "of course".
Kirthi has worked with leading designers of his day, including John Cavanaugh in London, in Paris at the House of Dior and in Rome with Emilio Schubert.
He held on to the title of Sri Lanka's 'Fashion Guru' throughout his lifetime, a title nobody ever disputed or will dispute even now when he is no more.
I myself have known Kirthi for over 40 years.
As a young girl, I would stare at him goggle eyed wherever I saw him, be it the Lionel Wendt, the Liberty or Regal Cinemas [oh yes in those days you did dress up even to go to the movies], the Lionel Wendt, parties and weddings.
The first occasion [I recall] where Kirthi published my picture in the papers, I would have been about 15 or 16 years and was in a shocking pink sari which I had draped Koorg style, and on seeing my picture in the papers, I was so excited, I couldn't wait to bump into the Great Man and thank him!
However when I did see him next, I was too tongue tied to do so and just grinned at him from ear to ear too bashful to approach him.
Subsequently through my involvement in the theatre, Kirthi and I soon became good friends, with not a week passing where I did not visit Kirthi; to consult him on clothes, make up, pester him to make my nose slimmer, mouth smaller, achieve more height by wearing the appropriate type of clothing, eat his famous 'hakuru mas' or crab curry, and of course absorb as much fashion sense as I could from the great man.
His home at Norris Canal Road was always a hive of activity, with people, coming and going at all odd hours of the day.
Models, actresses, socialites, you name them , they were all there! One of Kirthi's most endearing traits and one he always possessed was that he treated everyone alike, regardless of their status in life - be it the wife of the richest man in Sri Lanka, or a humble lad from a remote village who aspired to be a model or film star.
Kirthi treated them all alike, with his own brand of unfailing courtesy and charm, guaranteed to put anyone at ease.
Kirthi over the years dressed more people than most international designers I would think. He endured and improved with age like wine.
From brides to beauty queens, to models and housewives, gauche young girls [like myself] and acclaimed society hostesses, Kirthi has been friend and confidante to one and all and has even dressed three generations of brides.
"It is a great joy that I still have a clientele that spans thee generations," he once told me.
In the 50's and 60's and even in the 70's and 80's, fashion shows were not the products of 'high tech' as they are now, with laser beams flashing and strobe lights popping and every other gimmick you can think of.
Instead they demanded craftsmanship, ingenuity, creativity and a very fertile imagination.
Resources were meager, whilst prior to the advent of TV, especially Fashion TV, all we had to go by on were the occasional foreign magazine, which during the tenure of certain of our leaders, achieved the status of black market luxury items!! Kirthi achieved the impossible; putting on fashion shows and beauty pageants which were an absolute wonder to behold.
In the theatre and cinema, once again Kirthi excelled.
Apart from designing costumes, he enjoyed taking part in both films and plays.
Here too once again Kirthi displayed his versatility, going on to excel in these areas as well.
The pinnacle of costume design for Kirthi was doing the outfits for Lester James Pieris' 'Nidhanaya'; a film Kirthi recalled demanded every ounce of his creativity.
The versatile Kirthi also possessed a good voice which was put to use even as recently as a few months ago.
He has sung with Deva Surya Sena, the Colombo Philharmonic Orchestra, at concerts and private parties, and was very much in demand for his musical virtuosity as he was for his fashion sense.
Yet another achievement was the fact that Kirthi wrote an unbroken column for newspapers for over a period of 50 years.
Today one has to make appointments for anything - right down to even dropping in on your best friend! With Kirthi however I would just breeze in, demanding something to eat and drink as I am always hungry and then going on to ask him for any left overs for the stray dogs in the vicinity.
Kirthi over the years never changed, be it his attitude to life which was one of enjoying himself and living life to the full, how he dealt with the many and varied people who walked in and out of his life on a daily basis, as well as - and here I know we all envied him; HIS APPEARANCE, which was more or less the same as when I first set eyes on him! Kirthi worked daily and more often than not a seven day week, partied every night, more often at more than one venue, found time to cook and has never to my knowledge, indulged in 40 winks in the afternoon.
How did he do it I personally think it was his attitude to life which was one of try everything and do it to the best of your ability, enjoy yourself no matter what and take each day as it comes! A formula that has worked, as we all know. Today we celebrate Kirthi's life, his phenomenal achievements, and wish him godspeed. I for one, along with most of his legion of friends, would like to thank him, not for putting our pictures in the papers [ which of course we all loved ], or for making us look good, but for being friend, confidante, and a wonderful human being.
We will all miss him terribly, but his memory will always remain in our hearts as his clothes will continue to hang in our cupboards!

Dr Ajantha Horadagoda:
She did much for veterinary science field
I was extremely sad to hear the unexpected and sudden demise of Dr. Ajantha Horadagoda in Sydney, Australia.
I came to know Ajantha when she was an undergraduate at the University of Peradeniya.
At that time I was so impressed by her performance that I knew that one day she would come up in life and serve the world. This was actually what happened in her life.
After graduating with a veterinary degree from the University of Peradeniya, she proceeded abroad and completed a PhD degree. Unlike other postgraduates, qualified abroad, Dr. Ajantha and her husband, Dr Neil Horadagoda, returned home and assumed positions as senior lecturers at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Peradeniya.
Dr Ajantha served at the Faculty for about 23 years from 1979 to 2002, teaching undergraduates and conducting research.
After serving for a long period in Sri Lanka, she proceeded to Australia and worked as a scientist at the University of Sydney.
She later became the Head of the Research Laboratory, which was named as 'Future Dairy' Laboratory. She served in this position for almost 12 years, from 2004 - 2015.
It certainly must be sad to her husband, Neil and their two children to face the situation where Ajantha left them suddenly.
She served the world, Sri Lanka and Australia and many other countries followed research findings of Dr Ajantha.
I hope that the pain of her husband and the two sons would become less with time and being aware of what efforts she made to improve the veterinary science field of the world.
May Dr. Ajantha attain Nibbana.

D.P.P. Samarasekera:
Strict disciplinarian
and stickler to rules
On October 17 my friend Nandadeva called to say that his father had passed away.
I was dumbfounded and took awhile before I could regain my composure and express my heartiest condolences to him on the passing away of his father, a man I knew for over 40 years.
D.P.P. Samarasekera affectionately known as Sam among his friends lived a full life of 91 years. He gifted to the world eight children who are doing well in their lives. My friend from childhood Nandadeva whose eldest son is the incumbent Professor of Surgery at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Colombo. Samarasekera as a public officer of the highest calibre who functioned as the Registrar of the University of Colombo, an exalted position in university in times gone by.
After retirement he proceeded to Papua New Guinea to share his vast experience in university administration with the university there.
He was a strict disciplinarian and stickler to rules whether at work or at home.
Later in life, he looked after his wife who was afflicted with Alzheimer's disease with compassion and understanding for many years until her demise.
My interaction with him grew during those long years he attended to his ailing wife during which time he shared with me with pride and joy many interesting stories of his university life.
He made it a point to invite me personally for numerous religious events conduced in memory of his wife.
His contribution to the Buddhist order as recounted by the monks who attended his funeral was immense.
In keeping with this wishes he was accorded a private funeral within the shortest possible time.
May he attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana.

Around 650 Indian fishermen in custody in neighbouring countries
Nearly 650 Indian fishermen have been arrested until October this year by maritime security agencies of different countries, with Sri Lanka topping the chart.
According to government sources, some 350 fishermen have been arrested and 52 fishing trawlers seized by Sri Lankan navy, while Pakistan's MSA has arrested 239 Indian fishermen and impounded 35 fishing boats. Bangladesh has 56 and Burma six Indian fishermen in its custody.
In a majority of these cases Indian fishermen ventured into the waters or the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the neighbouring countries, which led their maritime security agencies to take action against them.

Schoolchildren have limited their water intake during school hours due to the poor drinking water and sanitation maintenance facilities, said Sabaragamuwa Provincial Director of Education S. Kuruppuarachchi.
He was addressing a meeting held at the Ratnapura Samurdhi reception hall regarding the launching of the Priority for Sanitation project in Ratnapura and Kegalle districts last week.
Chief Minister Maheepala Herath presided.
The government under this project will provide Rs. 246 million to upgrade sanitation and drinking water facilities in 20 national schools and 95 provincial schools in the Ratnapura and Kegalle districts.
Kuruppuarachchi said that even though a majority of schools in the island had adequate toilet and sanitation facilities, most students had shown reluctance to use them due to their low standard of construction and lack of proper maintenance.

China will have 1.45 b people by 2030 due to 2-child policy
CHINA: China's population is expected to reach 1.45 billion by 2030 following its move to scrap the three-decades-old one-child policy and permit all couples to have a second child, a senior official said.
In a major change to family-planning legislation, the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) yesterday announced it was abolishing the one-child policy.
It is expected that after the adjustment, the number of births will increase, with more than 20 million births expected in a peak year, said Wang Pei'an, deputy head of the National Health and Family Planning Commission. About 90 million couples will qualify to have a second child after the policy is enacted, Wang said, adding that around 60 per cent of the qualified women were 35 years old or older.
According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the population of China in 2014 was 1.368 billion.
Government approval for a second child will be abolished after the new policy is enacted, Wang was quoted as saying by state-run Xinhua news agency.
Wang said demographic problems, an ageing society and the pressure of elderly relatives on a single child had influenced the Party's decision.
The number of women of child-bearing age has dropped significantly, Wang said.
The two-children policy will rebalance the demographic structure, increase the workforce, help support the ageing population, and help with economic and social development, he said.
He, however, stressed, family planning will remain a basic state policy for the long-term, as China still had a large population, which put strain on economic and social development, and the environment.
First introduced in the late 1970s, the family planning policy aimed at reining in the surging population by limiting most urban couples to one child and most rural couples to two children, if the first child born was a girl. Yesterday's adjustment came after a previous easing of the one-child policy in November, 2013 which allowed couples to have two children if one of them was an only child.
It, however, drew poor response.
By the end of September, around 1.76 million had applied to have a second child, while the number of births in 2014 increased by 4,70,000 year on year, statistics from the Commission show. The change in birth rate has met our expectations, Wang said.

## Title: Commendable move by Dayasiri

Commendable move by Dayasiri
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara has finally decided to abandon the controversial four-year law which prevents sports officials from holding Executive Committee positions of a National Sports Association (NSA) and also to reinstate democracy at the NSAs controlled by interim committees, including Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).
He has promised to take immediate steps to amend the National Sports Law to fall in line with the International Olympic Charter before the end of next month and also to hold fresh elections thereafter to all NSAs.
The much-criticised new law prevented sports officials of all NSAs holding key positions for more than four successive years. This disqualified almost all veteran sports officials of the country from seeking re-election to their respective NSAs. That turned out to be a serious issue, not only because it violated the Olympic Charter but also created a dearth of experienced officials at NSAs.
The previous practice at most NSAs, including the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union (SLRFU), was to groom future presidents to head their respective sports controlling bodies. But the sudden implementation of the new law, drafted during the tenure of Dr. Maiya Gunasekera as the Chairman of the National Sports Council, forced all seasoned sports officials from serving their NSAs.
But Dr. Gunasekara had even told the Dayasiri's predecessor Mahindananda Authgamage, during whose tenure the new legislations were introduced, that their recommendations had been misinterpreted when drafting the new law. The eminent medical surgeon had said that he would never have become the SLRFU President if the new law had been there during his time.
What Maiya had meant was not to allow a sports official holding on to any one position such as the President, Secretary, Treasurer or Vice President for more than two successive terms, that's a maximum of four years. But it had been interpreted in a different and drastic manner when drafting the new law - that's no official should be allowed to serve in any senior position for more than four years, instead of stating it as any 'one position'.
Maiya's thinking
What Maiya and his team originally meant was that a President or a Secretary of a NSA should not be allowed to remain in those top positions for more than four successive years. But due to the mistake make in drafting the new regulations, even a Vice President of a NSA, who had served for more than four years, was made ineligible to contest for a higher position as the President. The controversial law brought a totally inexperienced and amateur set of officials, who even had not served in their respective NSA's executive committees before, to the top administrative positions. Hence, the day-to-day affairs and administration functions of some NSAs were in a total mess as the new officials do not have the company of any experienced officials in the executive committees.
Moreover, the new law clashed with the accepted international sports regulations and the Olympic Charter. As a result, several international sports governing bodies, including the International Olympic Committee, had sounded warnings to local NSAs as well as the National Olympic Committee (NOC). In fact, the NOC had alerted the Sports Ministry a couple of years ago but their objections had been overruled by the then Sports Minister.
Apart from the IOC, some of the leading world sports governing bodies such as World Rugby and FIFA have severely criticized the new Lankan regulations and forced the local authorities to make necessary changes to fall in line with the international requirements such as the Olympic Charter. It is heartening to see the Sports Ministry, under the stewardship of the new minister Jayasekera, working closely with the NOC to iron out differences. Unless we do away with the controversial law and accept the Olympic Charter, Sri Lanka will be forced to the wilderness in international sport.
Dayasiri had sounded that elections to all NSAs could be completed before the end of March next year after abandoning the new four-year rule. He also intends to reinstate democracy at the NSAs which are currently run by interim committees, including the SLC.
"I want to make the law for sports, not for personal vendettas of certain individuals and settling this problem is my priority right now as sports minister," the Minister was quoted as saying at a recent news conference. Dayasiri had sought to draft the law with a maximum term of President and Secretary to be eight years. This allows any official to serve as Vice President or Secretary for four years and seek election as the President, or to serve as Executive Committee member for four years and seek election for any of the senior positions for another four years.
In addition, any person, who had held four or eight years as administrators in one NSA will be allowed to serve in the same position at another NSA, subject to winning the elections. In such case number of years will be counted disregarding positions held in former sports associations which is not permitted at present.
The current regulations implemented last year after the amendments brought during the tenure of Aluthagamage allow only four years of two successive terms for any top positions of a NSA. This prevented many experienced sports administrators from contesting this year's elections to their respective NSAs.
Timely action
Dayasiri has made a timely move to rectify all these problems and make Sri Lanka acceptable to international world of sport. Most importantly, the new Sports Minister has given an assurance that the Sports Ministry would not interfere with the elections of NSAs and would only play a role of an observer. Dayasiri had said that the NSAs will have full autonomy to carry out their functions, sans any interference from the Sports Ministry.
The Sports Minister is making a sincere attempt to get the ban on the local aquatic sports union be lifted by the world governing body FINA so that Sri Lankan swimmers would be allowed to participate in international events under the lion flag.
He has already taken steps to amend the sports law and regulations according to the principles of global Olympic Charter. He has also taken actions to submit the issues arising in relation to amending the sports law and regulations to the NOC.
Following his recent discussions with the Deputy Director General of the IOC Pero Miro in Lausanne, Switzerland, Dayasiri has got the clear picture on the IOC member countries' requirement to meet the Olympic Charter. Hence, he has agreed to amend the sports regulations before the end of this year and hold fresh elections to all local sports governing bodies.
Following his discussions with the IOC, along with the top NOC officials, the IOC has agreed to provide technical assistance to build the Sri Lanka Olympic Museum. Reputed sports administrator and veteran cricket umpire Saman Amarasinghe is playing an active role in Sri Lanka's attempts to establish a national Olympic museum.
We earnestly hope that Dayasiri would keep his promises so that democracy will be reinstated in some of the NSAs which are currently administrated by interim committees. Especially, several fishy deals of the SLC, which too is run by an interim committee, have come to light in recent times.
The Sports Ministry should initiate a thorough investigation on numerous allegations against the SLC Interim Committee as the officials are answerable to its member clubs and associations.

FBI says no evidence of bomb in explosion on Maldives president's boat
The FBI has said it found no evidence an explosion on board the Maldivian presidents boat was caused by a bomb  calling into question allegations that have led to the arrest of the countrys vice-president.
Ahmed Adeeb is accused by the Maldivian government of plotting to assassinate President Yameen Abdul Gayoom.
The explosion took place on 28 September as Gayoom returned to the capital from the airport, which is on a separate island. Gayoom escaped unhurt but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured.
Adeeb and three soldiers were later arrested, with officials claiming foreign intelligence agencies had deemed the explosion an assassination attempt.
But the FBI said in a statement on Saturday that the debris it was asked to investigate turned out to be boat parts and not bomb remnants.
The FBI said submitted specimens were determined to be components from the boat and not the components of an improvised explosive device.
Based on the FBIs analysis which included forensic analysis of the scene, analysis of the items recovered from the scene, and chemical testing there is no conclusive evidence to attribute the explosion on the boat to an IED.
Gayoom appealed for calm after Adeebs arrest on 24 October escalated the countrys political crisis. The dramatic development marked the latest in a series of political shakedowns and power struggles in the Maldives that have seized the fragile young democracy since it held its first elections in 2008 after 30 years of autocracy under Gayooms half-brother.
Adeebs arrest was followed by protests and arrests. A former defence minister and the first democratically elected president, Mohamed Nasheed, are also behind bars, and Gayooms government has been criticised over sweeping laws it says are aimed at catching Islamist terrorists, but which the opposition says could be used to crack down on dissent.

First ever Urdu Language Centre in Sri Lanka inauguratedA
The first ever Urdu Language Training Center in Sri Lanka was inaugurated in Colombo last week.
National Dialogue Minister Mano Ganesan was the chief guest at the inauguration ceremony.
The High Commissioner of Pakistan in Sri Lanka Maj. Gen. (R) Syed Shakeel Hussain, National Integration and Reconciliation State Minister A.H.M. Fowzie, ministers, ambassadors and senior government officials also participated.
The Urdu Language Centre was established by the High Commission of Pakistan as part of Pakistan Culture, Education and Urdu Language Learning Centre.
It would impart language training to Pakistani, Sri Lankan and other expatriate students.
The Urdu Centre has been named after Baba-e-Urdu Maulvi Abdul Haq in view of his vision and extraordinary contribution towards development of the modern Urdu language.
The Centre will provide free of cost Urdu language education to the students as the entire expenditure of the training will be borne by the Pakistan government.The Pakistan High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Maj. Gen. (R) Syed Shakeel Hussain underscored that Urdu enjoys the status of being the mother tongue of millions of people who are residing in all parts of the world.
Urdu also enjoys the status of being the national language of Pakistan, he said.
Hussain underlined that Urdu language training will promote better understanding of Pakistan and its culture in Sri Lanka.
He added that Urdu language training will not only assist the Sri Lankan students who go to Pakistan for various educational scholarships and advance learning programmes, but will also prove to be a useful skill for the business community. The Chief Guest, Minister Ganesan said that the Urdu Centre would be beneficial for all Sri Lanka communities to learn Urdu language and observe Pakistani culture closely. He emphasised that Pakistan has remained a close friend and partner of Sri Lanka and has helped Sri Lanka in times of crisis throughout its history.

First gold for China
China grabbed their first gold at the world gymnastics championships on the penultimate day of competition as Fan Yilin shared an unprecedented four-way tie on uneven bars.
The 16-year-old from Beijing claimed her first major title but shared the glory with three other gymnasts -- American Madison Kocian and Russian duo Viktoriia Komova and Daria Spiridonova -- after all scored 15.366 points to the amazement of spectators at the Hydro Arena.
It is the first time that more than three gymnasts have shared a world title in the 112-year history of the championships, although five shared parallel bars silver back in 1922.
I was nervous when I was waiting for their scores, admitted Fan, who had competed her acrobatic routine between the bars first of the four and had a tense although amusing wait for the scores.
She was followed by 2011 champion Komova, who had fallen off her signature apparatus during the womens team final in which Russia finished fourth.
This time the 20-year-old made no mistake dismounting cleanly as intended only to see she had earned the same score as Fan.
Both then stood side by side watching expectantly as next Kocian and then Spiridonova performed only to see the same mark appear on the scoreboard to gasps of disbelief and laughter.
I am personally shocked, said Komova. Its the first time judges were having such hard time deciding on the champion on bars.
The scores are divided into difficulty and execution.
Fans performance was the most difficult while Kocian and Komova scored highest for execution. But when the scores were added together they all came to the same mark.
It made me laugh to see four gymnasts with the same score, but Im happy for all of the other gold medallists, said Fan, who also got a silver medal with China in the team event.
No silver or bronze was awarded with Americas Gabrielle Douglas, team gold and all-around silver medallist, finishing next best with 15.133 in the eight woman field.
All four hugged and kissed each other and the flags of the three countries were marched out onto the presentation stage and the Chinese, Russian and American national anthems were duly played one after the other.

Four dead, including suspect, in Colorado Springs shooting
Three people were killed in downtown Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Saturday morning before city police officers shot and killed a suspect, said the sheriff's office of El Paso County.
CNN affiliate KRDO reported that a heavily armed man shot and killed a bicyclist and two women. Witnesses said the man set the second floor of a residence on fire, KDRO reported.
Police received a report of a shooting about 8:45 a.m. along with a description of a suspect, the sheriff's office said.
Police encountered the suspect at Platte Avenue and Wasatch Street. The suspect fired multiple shots, and police returned fire and killed the suspect, the sheriff's office said.
Aaron Nicks told CNN affiliate KKTV that police shot the man "a good 20 times."
"What I saw was he kind of, like, spun around and [police] yelled, 'Drop it,' and he kind of [gestures as though he's holding a gun] went to aim and that's when they shot him down."
A pedestrian told KRDO that he was almost caught in the crossfire.
"The cop pulled up and said, 'Drop your gun,' and as soon as I heard that I got on my stomach in the median and they started shooting at each other and the bullets went over me," Ross Trottier said.
No identities or details were given concerning the people killed or the suspect. "We do not believe there is any further threat to the community," the department said in a news release.
About 10 downtown blocks were shut down while the incident is investigated, Jacqueline Kirby of the sheriff's office told CNN.
No motive has been released. The sheriff's office took over the investigation, as state law requires when an officer-involved shooting occurs. The officers who fired at the suspect have been placed on routine administrative leave.
Colorado Springs, with a population of about 445,000, is located at the base of Pike's Peak and is home to the U.S. Air Force Academy.(CNN)

Karuna blames Prabhakaran sting for leaving LTTE
Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman, who was Special Commander of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Batticaloa and Ampara districts, says that the rift between him and LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran took place in December 2002 when the Tiger chief accused him of "betrayal" of the kind Mahendrarajah alias Mahattaya was accused of in the early 1990s.
Mahattaya was later executed. Prabhakaran was livid with Karuna for persuading his chief negotiator, Anton Balasingham, to sign the December 5, 2002 "Oslo Declaration" which had committed the LTTE to "exploring the possibility of finding a political solution based on a federal structure within a united Sri Lanka."
At a stormy LTTE Central Committee meeting at Kilinochchi later in December, Karuna owned that he persuaded a reluctant Balasingham to accept the Norwegian government's draft declaration while other members of the LTTE delegation were either non-committal or suggested consultation with Prabhakaran before signing.
Defending his action, Karuna said that he supported the signing of the Declaration only to "save the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam from isolation" by the international community which had become hostile to armed movements following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack in New York.
"Prabhakaran was a good man, but he had no knowledge of globalization," Karuna told the Indian Express.
"At the special Central Committee meeting at Kilinochchi, Prabhakaran tore a copy of the Oslo Declaration to bits and accused me of selling out the struggle for Tamil Eelam. I tried to explain to him that the Declaration had only said that the two sides would explore a federal solution, not accept it. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam could always quit the talks if these were unsatisfactory, I submitted. But my arguments fell on deaf ears."
"However, the real sting was in Prabhakaran's charge that I had betrayed him as Mahattaya (his Deputy) did earlier. This hurt me deeply, because unlike Mahattaya, who was planning to kill Prabhakaran, I was only trying to save him and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam," Karuna said.
Sensing trouble, Karuna asked the European ceasefire monitors to urgently send a helicopter to fly him to his base in Batticaloa. "Once in Batticaloa, I refused to answer summons to come to Kilinochchi, knowing full well what would happen if I did," Karuna told Express.

Lankan intellectuals must help the country's forward march - President
President Maithripala Sirisena said that Sri Lanka needs the service of Sri Lankan intellectuals living abroad to drive the country forward.
Accordingly, the President invited Sri Lankan intellectuals living in Thailand to return to the country to serve the Motherland since freedom and democracy have been re-established in the country.
The President extended this invitation during a meeting with the Sri Lankan community in Thailand.
President Sirisena is on a four-day State visit to Thailand at the invitation of the Prime Minister of Thailand General Prayut Chan -o- cha to participate in a ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the establishing of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and Thailand.
Sri Lankan entrepreneurs, members of the Trade Association and university students participated at this meeting organized by the Sri Lanka Embassy in Thailand.
Addressing the gathering, the President said that anyone can perform their duties without any suspicion or fear as a result of peaceful atmosphere prevailing in the country.
"The time has come for everyone to act without fear and mistrust in the country. All are experiencing this peaceful atmosphere," the President added.
When the university students were asked by the President what they expect when they return to the country, they requested President Sirisena to create a conducive environment. They further said that there should be an environment for them to utilize the technical knowledge they have gained. Accordingly, they asked more opportunities in rural level for technological transshipment.
Responding to them, the President noted that a calm and conducive atmosphere has been established where everyone can work in a free and independent manner in all sectors. The entrepreneurs pointed out to the President the need of for streamlining the airline sector to further expand economic ties between the two countries.
The President added that the rapid progress achieved by Thailand is an example to other countries.
"The accelerate development achieved by Thailand is exemplary to other countries in the world," the President said referring to Thailand's economic development.

Lest history repeats
Statement by a group of concerned academics, civil society activists and artistes on the brutal police attack on HNDA (Higher National Diploma in Accountancy) students
Many of us issuing this statement today played an active role in the January 08, 2015 Presidential Election campaign and the subsequent General Election on August 17. Ours was not a political involvement in the sense of playing party politics but a principled political intervention to change the culture of governance in this country. We had witnessed close to a decade of increasing authoritarianism, the shrinking of democratic space and a culture of violent suppression of dissent under the defeated Rajapaksa regime.
We intervened because we wanted to see tangible change. We were, however, not so nave as to expect a complete change in the political culture of the country and were therefore not so surprised at the appointment of a jumbo Cabinet, or the nepotism that is creeping back into the functioning of the government, but we did have some minimum expectations from a new regime that campaigned almost exclusively on the theme of 'good governance' and a President and Prime Minister who repeatedly preach the mantra of democracy and good governance.
Similar attacks on protesting students
The events of 29/10/2015 where the police unleashed a brutal attack on a group of students seeking an opportunity to discuss systemic problems in the higher education sector has led us to seriously question whether the current regime is capable of meeting even our minimum expectations. What happened at Ward Place on 29/10/2015 is not an isolated incident. It appears to be a part of an emerging trend in how the incumbent government deals with dissent.
There were several similar attacks on protesting students, people protesting on various issues such as lack of drinking water, etc., post January 08 - though none probably match the brutality of this attack which left at least one student seriously injured.
The Sri Lankan police force, conditioned by decades of use and abuse by the political establishment, is no stranger to violence. The violent police reaction to student dissent, therefore, is no surprise. However, we believe that the police does not and would not act the way they did on 29/10/2015 unless there was a 'go ahead' from the political establishment.
Last Thursdays Police attack on protesting Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) students.
There is then clearly an element within the present government that feels democratic dissent is a threat that must be suppressed swiftly and violently. The incidents of 29/10/2015 and the images and the sounds of desperate students cringing in fear and being violently beaten, suggests that there is little to differentiate this regime from the previous one - after all, the previous regime took several years to arrive at its violent undemocratic destination while this regime seems to have achieved the same in the space of a few months.
We would like to remind the government that through its co-sponsored resolution at the UNHRC it has made an international and highly visible commitment to investigate historical human rights abuses in this country and that all eyes are on Sri Lanka at the moment.
Various government representatives have been busy marketing Sri Lanka's 'good governance' brand globally at various international forums. In such a context, is this how the government is attempting to prove its democratic credentials If students protesting about the restructuring of an academic programme and asking for more student welfare are treated in this way, what does that say about how the government will treat those who pose a more significant threat to it politically
We, the undersigned, demand that the newly established National Police Commission immediately conduct an investigation in to this incident while appreciating the proactive action taken by the Human Rights Commission which has stated that it would conduct an investigation.
At the same time, we stress the need to conduct these investigations impartially and make their findings public and that police officers, and those who issued orders to the police to act the way they did, are held publicly accountable. In addition, we demand that the President and Prime Minister reveal their stance on how the government plans to deal with dissent and public protests in future and explain to Sri Lankan society how they plan to prevent incidents like this from being repeated.

No evidence bomb caused explosion on Maldives leader's boat - FBI
There is no evidence that last month's explosion aboard the Maldivian president's boat was caused by a bomb, the FBI said, contracting government allegations that have led to the arrest of the country's vice president.
The Maldives' government accused Vice President Ahmed Adeeb of plotting to assassinate President Yameen Abdul Gayoom on September 28. He escaped unhurt as he wasn't sitting in his usual seat on the boat, the government said. His wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured.
The FBI said in a statement that the "submitted specimens were determined to be components from the boat and not the components of an improvised explosive device."
"Based on the FBI's analysis -which included forensic analysis of the scene, analysis of the items recovered from the scene, and chemical testing - there is no conclusive evidence to attribute the explosion on the boat to an IED," it added.
The Maldives sought assistance from the FBI, as well as investigators from Sri Lanka, India, Australia and Saudi Arabia.
Home Minister Umar Nazeer has said previously that the investigation by Sri Lankan experts found that the explosion was caused by a device that was small and designed not to kill everyone on board. According to Nazeer, it was meant to kill or incapacitate the president. Nazeer did not say anything about the type of the explosive device or how it was detonated. He did not answer phone calls seeking comment on Saturday and Sunday.
He seemed to have contradicted the FBI statement, writing on his Twitter account that "FBI examiners did not conclude that there was no IED in the blast.ie: they did not rule out an IED" on the boat. Investigators from India, Australia and Saudi Arabia have not yet released the results of their probes.
The explosion took place as Gayoom and his wife were returning to the capital from the airport, which is on a separate island. Gayoom escaped unhurt, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured in the blast. Adeeb's lawyer on Saturday called the allegations against his client untrue.
Authorities carried out raids on the homes and businesses of Adeeb's associates, but have refused to give any details about what may have been found. Gayoom has also fired his defense minister and the police commissioner after the blast.
The blast and the arrests deepened political unrest and power struggles in the Maldives since it held its first elections in 2008, after 30 years of autocracy under Gayoom's half-brother.
Gayoom won the presidency in 2013, after disputed elections against a predecessor who was forced to resign three years earlier amid public protests. Former President Mohamed Nasheed is now serving 13 years behind bars on a conviction delivered in a rushed trial widely criticised as unfair.

'NPC must regret en masse expulsion of Muslims by LTTE'
M. A. Sumanthiran, MP and Spokesman of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), has suggested that the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) pass a resolution regretting the en masse expulsion of Muslims from the Northern Province by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in October-November 1990.
Sumanthiran made this suggestion at a function earlier this week to mark the 25th anniversary of the infamous expulsion of 70,000 to 90,000 Muslims.
"Just as it passed a resolution condemning the genocide against the Tamils, the NPC should pass a resolution condemning the en masse expulsion of Muslims by the LTTE which amounts to ethnic cleansing. If the NPC does not do it, the world will not take the Tamils' contention that they had been subjected to genocide, seriously," Sumanthiran told Express on Sunday.
"The Tamils cannot condemn the misdeeds of the Sinhalese majority while ignoring the misdeeds of the Tamil majority," the Jaffna district MP said.
Asked if he plans to take up the matter with the NPC, which is dominated by the TNA, Sumanthiran said: "I am not a member of the NPC. I have given my view. It's for them to carry it forward."
Between October and November 1990, Muslims were asked to leave in less than 24 hours. Each person was allowed only Rs. 150 to Rs. 2,000 and a single change of clothing. All other properties were confiscated.
Of the displaced, 20,000 continue to live in squalid camps in Puttalam.
Resettlement of the returnees has been problematic in Mannar district. While some resident Tamils have questioned the returnees' claims, the government had designated some Muslim farms as "forest land".
The military also occupies some Muslim farmlands. According to Hilmy Ahamed of the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka, during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, some forest land had been cleared to settle 3,500 Sinhalese families from Hambantota and Suriyawewa.
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera has said that the justice and reconciliation mechanisms to be set up by the government following the September 30 UN Human Rights Council's resolution on Sri Lanka, will address the grievances of the displaced Muslims.

Offshoring the Economy: Why the US is on the Road to the Third World
US: On January 6, 2004, Senator Charles Schumer and I challenged the erroneous idea that jobs offshoring was free trade in a New York Times op-ed. Our article so astounded economists that within a few days Schumer and I were summoned to a Brookings Institution conference in Washington, DC, to explain our heresy. In the nationally televised conference, I declared that the consequence of jobs offshoring would be that the US would be a Third World country in 20 years.
That was 11 years ago, and the US is on course to descend to Third World status before the remaining nine years of my prediction have expired.
The evidence is everywhere. In September the US Bureau of the Census released its report on US household income by quintile. Every quintile, as well as the top 5%, has experienced a decline in real household income since their peaks. The bottom quintile (lower 20 percent) has had a 17.1% decline in real income from the 1999 peak (from $14,092 to $11,676). The 4th quintile has had a 10.8% fall in real income since 2000 (from $34,863 to $31,087). The middle quintile has had a 6.9% decline in real income since 2000 (from $58,058 to $54,041). The 2nd quintile has had a 2.8% fall in real income since 2007 (from $90,331 to $87,834). The top quintile has had a decline in real income since 2006 of 1.7% (from $197,466 to $194,053). The top 5% has experienced a 4.8% reduction in real income since 2006 (from $349,215 to $332,347). Only the top One Percent or less (mainly the 0.1%) has experienced growth in income and wealth.
The Census Bureau uses official measures of inflation to arrive at real income. These measures are understated. If more accurate measures of inflation are used (such as those available from shadowstats.com), the declines in real household income are larger and have been declining for a longer period. Some measures show real median annual household income below levels of the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Note that these declines have occurred during an alleged six-year economic recovery from 2009 to the current time, and during a period when the labor force was shrinking due to a sustained decline in the labor force participation rate. On April 3, 2015 the US Bureau of Labor Statistics neoconthreatannounced that 93,175,000 Americans of working age are not in the work force, a historical record.
Normally, an economic recovery is marked by a rise in the labor force participation rate. John Williams reports that when discouraged workers are included among the measure of the unemployed, the US unemployment rate is currently 23%, not the 5.2% reported figure.
In a recently released report, the Social Security Administration provides annual income data on an individual basis. Are you ready for this
In 2014 38% of all American workers made less than $20,000; 51% made less than $30,000; 63% made less than $40,000; and 72% made less than $50,000.
The scarcity of jobs and the low pay are direct consequences of jobs offshoring. Under pressure from shareholder advocates (Wall Street) and large retailers, US manufacturing companies moved their manufacturing abroad to countries where the rock bottom price of labor results in a rise in corporate profits, executive performance bonuses, and stock prices. The departure of well-paid US manufacturing jobs was soon followed by the departure of software engineering, IT, and other professional service jobs.
Incompetent economic studies by careless economists, such as Michael Porter at Harvard and Matthew Slaughter at Dartmouth, concluded that the gift of vast numbers of US high productivity, high value-added jobs to foreign countries was a great benefit to the US economy.
In articles and books I challenged this absurd conclusion, and all of the economic evidence proves that I am correct. The promised better jobs that the New Economy would create to replace the jobs gifted to foreigners have never appeared. Instead, the economy creates lowly-paid part-time jobs, such as waitresses, bartenders, retail clerks, and ambulatory health care services, while full-time jobs with benefits continue to shrink as a percentage of total jobs. These part-time jobs do not provide enough income to form a household. Consequently, as a Federal Reserve study reports, Nationally, nearly half of 25-year-olds lived with their parents in 2012-2013, up from just over 25% in 1999.

Researchers track effects of workplace stress
US: People often like to groan about how their job is killing them. Tragically, for some groups of people in the U.S., that statement appears to be true.
A new study by researchers at Harvard and Stanford has quantified just how much a stressful workplace may be shaving off of Americans life spans. It suggests that the amount of life lost to stress varies significantly for people of different races, educational levels and genders, and ranges up to nearly three years of life lost for some groups.
Past research has shown an incredible variation in life expectancy around the United States, depending on who you are and where you live. Mapping life expectancy around the nation by both county of residence and race, you can see that people in some parts of the U.S. live as many as 33 years longer on average than people in other parts of the country, the researchers say.
Those gaps appear to be getting worse, as the wealthy extend their life spans and other groups are stagnant. One study found that men and women with fewer than 12 years of education had life expectancies that were still on par with most adults in the 1950s and 1960s - suggesting the economic gains of the last few decades have gone mostly to more educated people. The financial crisis and subsequent recession, which put many people in economic jeopardy, may have worsened this effect.
There are lots of reasons that people with lower incomes and educations tend to have lower life expectancies: differences in access to health care, in exposure to air and water pollution, in nutrition and health care early in life, and in behaviors, such as smoking, exercise and diet. Past research has also shown that job insecurity, long hours, heavy demands at work and other stresses can also cut down on a worker's life expectancy by taking a heavy toll on a worker's health.
But researchers say this is the first study to look at the ways that a workplace's influence on life expectancy specifically break down by racial and educational lines.
To do their analysis, they divided people into 18 different groups by race, education and sex.
They then looked at 10 different workplace factors - including unemployment and layoffs, the absence of health insurance, shift work, long working hours, job insecurity and work-family conflict - and estimated the effect that each would have on annual mortality and life expectancy.
The data show that people with less education are much more likely to end up in jobs with more unhealthy workplace practices that cut down on one's life span. People with the highest educational attainment were less affected by workplace stress than people with the least education, the study says.
Race and gender also played a role. Blacks and Hispanics lost more years of life because of work than whites did in every education and gender category. And women generally fared better than their male counterparts, with one exception: educated Hispanic women lost significantly more of their life span to working conditions than educated Hispanic men did.
Some of the categories that the researchers studied took a bigger toll on life expectancy than others. Across all groups, unemployment and layoffs, and a lack of health insurance were the factors that exerted the biggest influence.
Low job control was the next biggest influence for both men and women, followed by job insecurity in men and shift work in women. Here's what those factors look like for different racial, gender and educational groups:
The researchers say their findings have a clear takeaway: We need to focus more on creating healthier work environments, especially for workers with less education. The good news is that the way to accomplish this is relatively straightforward.
They suggest that many of these issues - including long hours and shift work, the lack of health insurance and paid time off, and job insecurity - can be partly solved through better policies to support workers.

Pakistan U19 could not make a much of an impression with the bat to win a single match in the two series, but their bowlers spearheaded by Shadab Khan who finished with a tally of 10 wickets along with team mates Hayatullah and Saif Ali claiming 5 wickets apiece in the Youth Test series did well with the ball to occupy first three spots in the bowling list though their approach in no way helped Pakistans cause.

St.Josephs, Isipathana and Thurstan in a run-fest
All three schools complete three-innings victories after bowlers flattened the oppositions
Malshan Rodrigo scoring an unbeaten half century and following up with a dramatic match-haul of seven wickets surged St.Josephs to an innings and 57-run victory over Maris Stella in their U19 D1 encounter concluded at St.Josephs ground this afternoon. Jehan Daniel, another emerging all-rounder in the schools circle today also contributed for Joes victory with a good all-round effort. St.Josephs batting first scored an imposing 282 for nine before they declared their innings after 61 overs and Malshan, Kavindu and Jehan bowled out Maris Stella twice for 107 and 118 without allowing them to make St.Josephs bat again.
Thushal Madusankas 12 wickets played a major role in Thurstans innings and 13-run victory over Mahanama at Kadirana ground. Thurstan bowlers well defending their first innings score of 188 that was hardly enough to earn a three-innings win specially against a team like Mahanama somehow managed to restrict Mahanamas both innings to a total of 175 and finish the match without going into the fourth innings saving an innings and 13 runs to their credit.
The production of three centurions in a single innings was the highlighting factor of the match between Isipathana and Holy Cross when Pramod Maduwantha (118),Sanjula Abeywickrama (105*) and Ayana Siriwardana (100*) scored centuries for Isipathana to make a hell-raising 385 for five in their first innings. It was not only in batting Pramod Maduwantha excelled in this match but also in bowling. Pramods 11 wickets in the match was the cornerstone of Isipathanas success with the ball as Holy Cross managed only 170 in their first innings and after following only 73 to loss the match by an innings and 142 runs.
Isipathana beat Holy Cross by an innings and 142 runs
Isipathana College: 385-5 d in 72.1 overs (Pramod Maduwantha 118, Sanjula Abeywickrama 105*, Ayana Siriwardana 100*, Malinda Jayod 3/97)

Thomians down Joseph Vaz after bowlers excellence
U19 D1 first-round match roundup
St. Joseph Vaz College VS S. Thomas College, Mt.Lavinia
S. Thomas College, Mt.Lavinia who are yet to play a tournament-match this season beat St.Joseph Vaz by 9 wickets in yet another traditional game concluded today at their home ground after their bowlers approached differently in the two innings of the opposition to earn them this big-win. When Joseph Vaz batted first on invitation, Thomian bowlers, Rasmika Opatha, Shenal De Silva and Kanishka Perera captured six wickets at two apiece conceding just 14 runs restricted them to a score of 50 in the first innings before S. Thomas' in reply declared their innings after they had scored 128 for six with Yohan Mendis top scoring with a patient 40 and Thulanjana Fernando completing a six-for for Joseph Vaz. After Joseph Vaz batted for the second time around needing a minimum of 78 to make Thomians bat again somehow managed to do so, but the overall-lead of mere four runs they gained was not at all sufficient to avert their defeat. Thomians star-bowler Sachitha Jayathilake was the destroyer of Josephs second innings as he single-handedly completed a six-wicket haul which Thomians needed the help of three bowlers to do in the first innings.
St. Joseph Vaz College: 50 in 33.4 overs (Rasmika Opatha 2/03, Shenal De Silva 2/04, Kanishka Perera 2/07) & 82 in 51 overs (Sachitha Jayathilake 6/17)
S. Thomas' College, Mt.Lavinia: 128-6 in 38 overs (Yohan Mendis 40, Ravindu Thilakarathne 20, Dulanjana Fernando 6/43) & 5-1 in 3.3 overs

Dharmasoka College VS Nalanda College
In another traditional match ended this afternoon at Nalanda Ground, Dharmasoka, Ambalangoda forced a draw after Nalanda gained first innings advantage faring better than their opposition. The highlight of the match was Kavindu Bandaras match-haul of 9 wickets for hosts that made the difference in the end. After Ambalangoda school was put in, Dinuka Dilshan making an unbeaten 69 helped them reach 181.
Nalanda gained a first innings lead of 69 after they made 250 for six in reply before declaration with Malinga Amarasinghe and Kasun Sandaruwan making fifties. Dharmasokas second innings was less impressive compared to their first innings as they managed only 158 for nine before bad light brought the game to a tame draw in the end.
Dharmasoka College: 181 in 61.2 overs (Dinuka Dilshan 69*, Kavish Kumara 28, Kavindu Bandara 4/52, Nimnaka Rathnayake 2/24) & 158-9 in 39.5 overs (Nimesh Mendis 36, Kasun Maduranga 28, Kavindu Bandara 5/53, Dilan Samaraweera 2/17)

SL bowl; Gunathilaka, Jayasuriya debuts
Sri Lanka chose to bowl in the first ODI against West Indies, likely owing to a preference to chase in rain-affected games that may be subject to Duckworth-Lewis calculations. Rain delayed the start time by 80 minutes, but a full 50-overs-a-side match would nevertheless be played.
Two players debut for Sri Lanka. Left-hand batsman and offspin bowler Shehan Jayasuriya would play his first ODI, after having played a T20 international in August. Danushka Gunathilaka - an opening batsman by trade - would play his first international in any format. Wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Chandimal was suspended for this match for his part in an on-field altercation during the India Test series in August, and Kusal Perera would take the gloves in his stead.
Sri Lanka play two specialist spinners in Sachithra Senanayake and Ajantha Mendis, along with two frontline quicks in Suranga Lakmal and Lasith Malinga.
Sunil Narine returned to international cricket after a 14-month hiatus, which had partly been forced by problems with his action. West Indies opted for a pace-heavy attack, including Jerome Taylor, Andre Russell, Carlos Brathwaite and captain Jason Holder. Andre Fletcher would likely open the batting alongside Johnson Charles.

## Title: Some shark species may adapt to climate change

Some shark species may adapt to climate change
US: Some shark species may be able to cope with the rising temperature and the subsequent decrease of water salinity, a new study has found.
The study of sharks that lived in warm Arctic waters millions of years ago suggests that some shark species could handle the falling Arctic salinity that may come with rising temperatures. No one knows exactly what effect climate change could have on various species; scientists believe some species will be at risk, though others might thrive.
According to study leader Sora Kim, from the University of Chicago, past climate change in the Arctic can serve as a proxy to better understand our current climate change and aid future predictions.
The Eocene epoch, she said, is like a deep-time analogue for whats going to happen if we dont curb CO2 emissions today, and potentially what a runaway greenhouse effect looks like.
Kim and Jaelyn Eberle from the University of Colorado, studied shark teeth from a coastal site on Banks Island. This allowed them to better understand the changes in ocean water salinity across a broader geographic area during a time of elevated global temperatures.
Kim isolated and measured the mass ratio of oxygen isotopes 18 to 16 found in the prepared enameloid (somewhat different from human tooth enamel) of the shark teeth. Sharks constantly exchange water with their environment, so the isotopic oxygen ratio found in the teeth is directly regulated by water temperature and salinity.
With assumptions made about temperatures, the group was able to focus on extrapolating salinity levels of the water.

Sri Lanka to take up study on whales
Sri Lanka, known for its well-established whale watching industry, will take up a study on whales.
This was decided by the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) Council of Ministers which met in Pandang, Indonesia, during October 20-23. Foreign Affairs Deputy minister Harsha de Silva represented Sri LankaA six-day joint naval exercise between India and Sri Lanka which commenced in the seas off Trincomalee ended yesterday.
The research project, called the non-economic value of the whale watching industry in Sri Lanka, would cover issues concerning conservation and management. The IORA Centre of Excellence, housed at the Institute of Policy Studies, would take up the study, Foreign Affairs Ministry Director General (Economic Affairs Division) Grace Asirwatham said.
Referring to concerns over the existence of whales in the light of the increased shipping and human activities, the official expressed the hope that the research would deal with such issue too.
A workshop would be held and as the season for whale watching would be between December and March, the authorities were keen on having the meet before March.
Pointing out that Australia had also shown interest in taking part in the project, Asirwatham said International Whaling Commission would be involved in the study, the findings of which would be shared with other member-countries of the IORA.
The Association would approve $ 50,000, which would be sufficient only to host the workshop, Asirwatham said, pointing out that the study would need a lot of money as foreign experts had to be engaged.
The Commission was expected to provide its contribution for the study, she added. - The Hindu

Technology can help build superpowers - Zuckerberg
INDIA: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and caped crusader Batman have one thing in common -- both believe technology is a superpower.
Speaking to students at IIT here at the Townhall, the young billionaire was asked what is the one super power he would want to help people.
Dressed in his signature grey T-shirt and jeans, Zuckerberg replied, One of the great things about technology is that you can build superpowers for people in the world and that some of the stuff that is really exciting.
Citing the example of virtual technology Oculus, he said this could allow people to teleport.
You will be able to put on a headset and go anywhere in the world, play ping pong with somebody in some other part of the world. That is pretty crazy... that is going to be pretty good, he said.
While there were times when the audience grilled him about issues like net neutrality and how the worlds largest social networking platform intends to connect billions, they also wanted to know if the unwanted invitations from Candy Crush would stop.
Were working on a solution to address that, replied Zuckerberg to the question that has been the most voted by users.
Troubled by unwanted invitations to play Candy Crush on Facebook, users have complained and even started online petitions to block the invites.
He also talked about being passionate about what one wants to do with their start ups and asked the youngsters to focus on solving issues they saw rather than just starting a business.
Zuckerberg also talked about his wife and how he was looking forward to their daughters arrival.

Three quarters of car thefts in France by Mouse Jacking
FRANCE: Three quarters of car thefts in France are carried out using electronic hacking, it was claimed yesterday (Thursday), prompting calls for security improvements in a range of vehicles sold in Europe.
The Smart Fortwo model was Frances most stolen car, with the Ford Fiesta and Peugeot 406 models also popular among thieves who it is feared could use the same tactics in Britain.
The figures were disclosed two months after computer scientists in the UK warned that thousands of cars, including high-end marques such as Porsches and Maseratis, are at risk of electronic hacking. Their research was suppressed for two years by a court injunction for fear it would help thieves steal vehicles to order.
The kit required to carry out such mouse jacking, as the French have described the practice, can be bought on the internet for around pounds 700 and the theft of a range of models can be pulled off within minutes, experts say.
The figures prompted urgent calls by a leading French car magazine for manufacturers to secure your cars.
Many cars use radio frequency identification chips which are designed to verify the identity of the ignition key being used to start the car engine. If thieves get into the vehicle without the right key, the engine should refuse to start.

Word power can both kill and thrill!
I was invited to speak recently at a book launch titled Creative Arts Therapies for Autistic Children by the famed dramatherapist Ravindra Ranasinha. At the outset may I remind you that I do not consider myself a psychologist or psychiatrist and neither do I profess being one.
You might wonder then why I, a humble journalist, had been dragooned into speaking at an event addressed mostly by erudite specialists in the field. But at the same time may I inform you that both my wife and I are qualified psychological counsellors trained by the International Samaritans in Hong Kong.
Briefly about the author Ravidra Ranasinha: He has been a ministering angel to the wretched of this nation. He has been able to provide his healing touch with those same admirable qualities of love and compassion in the face of seemingly overwhelming odds. The clients he works with have differing needs, from children in the autistic spectrum to older people with dementia, self-harming adolescents, people with histories of sexual and/or physical abuse, those suffering from a mental illness and women with post-natal depression.
Dramatherapy is essentially a creative healing therapy that uses the performing arts to promote psychological, emotional and social change. Dramatherapists are both artists and clinicians and draw on their trainings in theatre/drama and therapy to create methods to engage clients in effecting psychological, emotional and social changes. The therapy makes use of role play, voice work, myth, ritual and storytelling. Movement and objects can also be used expressively without words. It can help increase clients self awareness and offer a creative way for an individual or group to explore and solve personal and social problems
The subject I chose to speak about at the launch was a far cry from the discourses of the scholarly experts on the panel who enlightened the packed audience on the programs, therapies and research breakthroughs on the immensely complex subject of Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis or ASD.
Being a wordsmith who has worked internationally I chose to make a discourse on the power of the spoken word. Words as you are doubtlessly aware are really two-edged swords - they can destroy or empower, hurt and heal and even kill. Our words have a tremendous power to bring healing and strength to another person or to hurt in a very deep way. We should never underestimate the power we have to use our words for a positive effect on a persons life or, in some cases, a lasting negative effect.
How do we comfort the parents of such children who have been through the Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis or ASD. However well-intentioned comments that were meant to comfort can sometimes cut like a knife! Yet what do you say to parents carrying such a cross Even with the right to be wary you must never bring yourself to say the wrong things. No you dont blurt out that you are sorry! Because that sometimes makes things worse
You dont say youre sorry because these people dont want to be pitied. And it makes things worse not better. While for many of them the life after diagnosis will be different, it is not less. While their child might miss out on some things, he or she is not considered less. You dont say to these parents, Hell be fine. ASD is very complex and no two journeys are the same. One parent told me: Even as a mother of a child with autism I am very hesitant to give advice, as I know my sons autism is not your childs autism.
We should all know better than to say Really He seems so normal. Those phrases do not comfort, they simply insert an opinion when our opinion was not asked. Parents facing an ASD diagnosis do not want unsolicited advice or pity. They do not want you to minimize their feelings or give false hope.
They want you to listen. They want you to care. They want you to stay in their lives and not brand them as special needs parents. They want you to understand that although their lives might be taking a different turn, they still need friends. Their children still need friends and subtle support.
Then what the heck do you say to these people Sure as a counsellor I too was at a loss for words. Even as a professional wordsmith I could not find the right words Then like a bolt from the blue it came to me. The two simple and perfect words you can say: Im here. And mean it. Mean it through every struggle, every victory and every passing day.
Mean it on the days when autism is all they can talk about and on the days when they need an extra set of hands. Mean it when you are making out the list of which children to invite to your childs birthday party. They dont need you to be an expert on autism. They dont need you to always say the right thing. Now, more than ever, they need you to just be there.

All Black magic at Halloween World Cup final
Richie McCaw lifted the Rugby World Cup as fireworks, streamers and jets of flame shot into the sky at Twickenham after New Zealand defeated Australia in the 2015 final on Saturday.
With laser lights piercing through the dry ice, the All Blacks captain gave The Webb Ellis Cup a kiss as the party began on the pitch and in the stands after their 34-17 victory inflicted Halloween misery on their old rivals.
New Zealand's victorious players drenched each other in champagne and performed a celebratory Haka war dance as they completed a lap of honour on becoming the first side to win the World Cup three times.
Chants of "All Blacks! All Blacks!" rang round the stadium as the winners received their medals and took their places on the podium, with coach Steve Hansen the last one up.
Prince Harry, the honorary president of the England 2015 organisers -- and fifth in line to become the monarch of both Australia and New Zealand -- presented the trophy.
After the Wallabies completed a forlorn lap of honour, Harry shared a few words and a handshake with McCaw before the skipper thrust the trophy into the air.
His side then broke out the champagne under another blitz of fireworks from the stadium roof.
The All Blacks embraced each other in a giant huddle at the final whistle, which completed a Halloween nightmare for Wallabies fans who had watched Australia narrow the deficit from 18 points to four.
The job of carving New Zealand onto the trophy stand for the third time fell to master engraver Keith O'Connell from London silversmiths Thomas Lyte, who busily got to work when the final whistle went.
Before kick-off, several rugby fanatics were drifting round outside the southwest London stadium desperately looking for spare tickets as the England 2015 tournament reached its climax.
One exhausted-looking woman from New Zealand had a sign saying she had flown 26 hours to be at the final, and now just needed a ticket.
"I'm tense, I'm shaking," said Ian Harper, dressed from head to toe in Australian gold.
Some wore full Halloween skeleton costumes as they milled around in the autumn sunshine, an unusually warm 16 degrees Celsius (61 degrees Fahrenheit).
Fever pitch -
Among the 80,125 inside the packed stadium, Queen Elizabeth II's 94-year-old husband Prince Philip and Harry's brother Prince William, second in line to the throne, completed the royal contingent.
Australian pop star Kylie Minogue was also in the crowd, as was New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key. Melbourne-born global media baron Rupert Murdoch turned up with Jerry Hall, the former partner of Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger, both wearing Australia scarves.
The teams ran onto the Twickenham pitch to a cacophony of noise amid the flames and fireworks.
There was a huge roar as the Royal Air Force's Red Arrows aerobatics display team flew overhead, streaming red, white and blue smoke through the air just as the teams lined up for the national anthems, the atmosphere reaching fever pitch.
Substitute Keven Mealamu led the All Blacks through the Kapa o Pango version of their Haka war dance, performed only at their biggest matches.
New Zealand prised open the Australia defence just before the interval, when wing Nehe Milner-Skudder crossed the tryline.
"It's looking comfortable," said Terry Dunleavy, 51, from Auckland, as he contemplated the 16-3 half-time scoreline.
"We're fitter, stronger and we're strangling them."
Campbell, 34, from Melbourne, said: "I came with low expectations and I shan't be disappointed."
Just two minutes into the second half, New Zealand centre Ma'a Nonu dashed through the Wallabies' defence for a second All Blacks try.
But Australia fans were revitalised when New Zealand's Ben Smith was sin-binned in the 57th minute and No 8 David Pocock immediately scored a try, with centre Tevita Kuridrani adding another 11 minutes later.
That racked up the tension, with New Zealand 21-17 ahead with 10 minutes left, but man-of-the-match Dan Carter's drop goal and a long-range penalty five minutes from time set the All Blacks clear.
And when replacement Beauden Barrett ran through to score a third try for New Zealand, All Blacks fans were in raptures.
