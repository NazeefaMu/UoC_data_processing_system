Convention will strengthen SLFP - President
President Maithripala Sirisena said the 65th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) would strengthen the partys will to remain in the national unity government.
We have to forget our greed for power and remain united to create a better country for the next generation, the President said, while addressing a meeting with newspaper editors and media at the Presidents House, last morning. He said the national unity government should be strengthened to resolve several key issues, including the repayment of foreign debts amounting to Rs. 9000 billion.
He said the national unity government, in which the two main political parties function as the key stakeholders, lays the perfect foundation to find solutions to long-drawn socio-economic issues.
Commenting on differences of opinion within the SLFP over the convention, the President said all the right thinking MPs of the party would attend the convention and show their solidarity.
He also expressed confidence that the SLFP seniors would resolve their internal issues, amicably, through negotiations.
At the convention, we will make some important decisions on the partys future course of action and internal reforms, the President revealed.
When asked about the recent remark he made on revealing secrets involving party dissidents, the President said it had nothing to do with cases of bribery and corruption.
Those are just political secrets and nothing more! One has to understand that they are not files. For instance, when I addressed a commemorative event of the late Jeyaraj Fernandopulle recently, I revealed some secrets about the previous government. That was what I meant when I made this remark at the political rally in Matara, the President explained.

JO to boycott SLFP Convention
The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday, decided not to participate in the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys 65th Convention to be held in Kurunegala tomorrow.
According to Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma, 59 Parliamentarians representing the Joint Opposition will not participate in this Convention. Parliamentarian Alahapperuma said the Joint Opposition made this decision to prevent the SLFP from becoming a branch of the United National Party when it celebrates its 66th anniversary in 2017. He said that they arrived at this decision after consulting the party members at grass-roots level in every constituency of the country.
Addressing a press conference at former President Mahinda Rajapaksas office in Battaramulla, Alahapperuma said Local Government representatives and Provincial Councillors representing the Joint Opposition will not participate in this Convention. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party of today has become a cats paw of the United National Party. It follows the policies of the United National Party,he said.
He said that SLFP electoral organisations around the country have decided not to participate in this Convention with an objective of directing the party on a proper path.
We do not have any personal animosity with President Maithripala Sirisena nor any other SLFP Ministers in the government,he said.

True SLFPers will attend party convention: Duminda
The attendance of the 65th Anniversary Convention on September 4 will speak voloumes as to who the true SLFPers are, SLFP General Secretary and Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
Commenting to the Daily News on the decision of the SLFP members attached to the Joint Opposition to boycott the party convention, he said the real faces of the JO members have been exposed and the SLFP rank and file should take a decision on them.
The SLFP Convention is a significant event where the participation of all true SLFPers is expected. Non participation at this event would let down the party supporters. Those who boycott it have put their own personal agendas before the party. It is the party rank and file who would further be inconvenienced by it, he commented.
The minister however said the Central Committee of the party has not made any decision to take action against those who boycott the convention.
He said the non-attendance of the SLFP members attached to the JO would be an incentive for the true SLFPers at village level to mark their presence at the Kurunegala rally.
Minister Dissanayake further said MP Chamal Rajapaksa called him yesterday to inform that he would try his best to attend the party convention.
MP Rajapaksa also said that he would never support any move to split the party adding that he would take the leadership in such occasion to unify the party, he said.
