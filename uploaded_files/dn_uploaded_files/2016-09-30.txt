Dimuth, Kusal and Lahiru under the  microscope

Three Sri Lanka Test southpaws whose positions in the national team are on the fringe have been given another opportunity to cement their places when they were named in the squad of 15 selected for the first two unofficial tests against West Indies A commencing next month.
Opening bat Dimuth Karunaratne, wicket-keeper/batsman Kusal Perera and top order batsman Lahiru Thirimanne figure in the squad along with several youngsters who played a prominent role in Sri Lanka under 19s successful cricket tour of England recently.
Karunaratne who has been named captain of the Sri Lanka A team has crossed fifty only once in his last 15 Test innings. He averaged a poor 6.83 with a top score of 22 in the recently concluded home Test series against Australia.
Perera whose batting style has been compared to former dashing opener and captain Sanath Jayasuriya has not lived upto that image by the number of runs he has scored.
Having showed a lot of promise on his Test debut against India at the SSC last year with twin half-centuries Perera has yet to complete a fifty in his next 10 innings. He came quite close to doing that in the second Test against Australia at Galle being dismissed for 49 and 35.
Lahiru Thirimanne

Thirimanne has been an enigma. He has been highly rated by some past Sri Lanka cricketers and coaches but has failed to deliver despite being in the Test circuit for the past five years. In 26 Tests (50 innings) he sports a Test average of 24.00 - not encouraging figures for a top order batsman. Following a poor tour of England where he averaged a low 17.40 Thirimanne lost his place in the team to the highly talented Kusal Mendis in the recent home series against Australia.
Lakshan Sandakan who bowls left-arm chinaman and made his Test debut against Australia has also been given a place in the squad.
These are all extremely talented players and we cannot discard them just like that, said chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya.
We have included them for the West Indies A series and hope they will make use of the opportunity to cement their places in the senior team, he said.
Their performances will be closely monitored by the selection panel with the tour to Zimbabwe towards the latter part of October in mind. Its a balanced side with a look into the future. We have included several outstanding under 19 cricketers as well and its an opportunity for them to show case their talent, Jayasuriya said. Among the under 19 players are Charith Asalanka, captain of the Sri Lanka under 19 side and recently crowned the Sunday Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year, Avishka Fernando, Asitha Fernando and Lahiru Kumara.
Kusal Perera

The performances of players like Roshen Silva, Niroshan Dickwella, Asela Gunaratne, Vimukthi Perera, Prabath Jayasuriya, Anuk Fernando and Kasun Madushanka in the domestic circuit and Sri Lanka A sides have also been recognized.
West Indies A are due to arrive tomorrow (Saturday) and commence a three-match unofficial test series with Sri Lanka A on October 4 at the R Premadasa Stadium. They will also play a series of three one-day matches.
SRI LANKA A SQUAD: Dimuth Karunaratne (captain), Kusal Perera (vice-captain), Lahiru Thirimanne, Roshen Silva, Charith Asalanka, Niroshan Dickwella, Asela Gunaratne, Avishka Fernando, Anuk Fernando, Vimukthi Perera, Prabath Jayasuriya, Lakshan Sandakan, Asitha Fernando, Lahiru Kumara, Kasun Madushanka.
