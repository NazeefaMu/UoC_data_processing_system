Bugged engine drivers refuse to ply
A passenger train scheduled to ply from Polgahawela to Ratmalana had to be cancelled yesterday with the two engine drivers refusing to operate the train citing fatigue as they had spent a sleepless night in the retiring room due to Bed Bugs.
The train which leaves Polgahawela station at 5.30 am carrying around 2000 passengers daily during the early morning rush hour had to be cancelled as the drivers refused to operate the train citing the Bug issue, Railway authorities at Polgahawela said. The Station Master at Polgahawela while confirming the incident said the two drivers were adamant despite his appeals.
He said that he had requested a written statement from the two drivers citing reasons for their refusal. He also admitted that a large number of people, mostly state and private sector workers were highly inconvenienced due to the cancellation. It is learnt that the contract to clear bugs in the station is handled by a private company. They were seen busy at work at the Polgahawela station following the incident, sources said.
Meanwhile, sources at the Polgahawela station said that engine drivers and their assistants who use the retiring rooms at the station had rented rooms at the nearby Rest House due to the bed bug issue.

Government doing all it can: Solongaarachchi on Meethotamulla damage

Former Kottikawatte-Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Prasanna Solongaarachchi said the government is doing all it can to mitigate the damage caused by the Meethotamulla garbage dump.
Although this problem began during the time of previous governments, the tragedy happened in the time of our government, therefore as a government, we are taking the responsibility for this incident and doing all we can to mitigate the damage, he said.
The victims and who passed away are all helpless and had nothing to do with this problem, he further lamented.
As a responsible government all we can do is pay compensation for the victims and take steps to prevent such incidents occurring in the future.
Commenting on claims that he silent in the aftermath of the Meethotamulla disaster, despite championing their cause in the previous years, the former Kottikawatte-Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman said he had not been silent, but had been active on the ground.

Australian govt. announces changes
The Australian government announced on April 18, changes to its employer sponsored temporary skilled work visa arrangements.
The current visa for temporary skilled workers (the 457 visa) will be replaced by a new Temporary Skill Shortage (TSS) visa in March 2018.
The TSS visa programme will comprise two streams: a short-term stream allowing entry for up to two years, and a medium-term stream allowing entry for up to four years.
The changes are designed to ensure Australia can continue to benefit from the contributions temporary skilled workers have made to the Australian economy over many years. There will continue to be extensive opportunities for such individuals.The TSS visa will replace the 457 visa as the primary visa used to meet Australias trade commitments on the entry of temporary skilled workers under the WTOs General Agreement on Trade in Services and Free Trade Agreements.
While labour market testing will be applied to the TSS visa, it will not apply where inconsistent with trade obligations, reflecting current practice with the 457 visa. The TSS visa will ensure that the Temporary Skilled Migration programme better meets Australias skills needs, and increase the quality and economic contribution of skilled migrants.
Separately, from April 19, 2017, the occupation list under the existing 457 programme is being reduced to remove occupations that are either generally restricted to Australian citizens, have had little or no applications from overseas workers or because of Australian labour market considerations. The 457 occupation list has changed in the past, is designed to change and is subject to ongoing review. Occupations subject to commitments in free trade agreements are not impacted by changes to the occupation list.
In the medium-term stream only, English language requirements will increase to a minimum of five across all components of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) (or equivalent test).The current 457 visa English language requirement will apply to the short-term stream: an overall average IELTS (or equivalent test) score of five, with a minimum score of at least 4.5 in each component.
English language requirements ensure that migrants are less vulnerable to exploitation and are able to participate fully in the workforce and community.
Eligibility criteria for both streams of the TSS visa will include work experience of at least two years to improve the quality of the skilled migrants entering the Australian workforce. This requirement is not inconsistent with Australias trade obligations.
For permanent employer sponsored skilled visa programmes, the permanent residence eligibility period will be extended from two years to three years. Applicants will be required to demonstrate three years relevant work experience and the training requirement for employers to contribute towards training Australian workers will be strengthened.
Further information on the reforms is available on the website of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP): www.border.gov.au/Trav/Work/457-abolition-replacement. Current 457 requirements are explained on DIBPs website at: www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa-1/457-.

BIMSTEC: Heads of state visits boost chances of vehicle pact
The recent visits by Bangladesh PM, Nepalese President, and upcoming trip of Sri Lankan PM to India this week has given momentum of BIMSTEC Motor Vehicle Agreement (MVA), envisaged as a multil-modal regional connectivity initiative between seven states of BIMSTEC after the proposed SAARC MVA could not be concluded due to Pakistans intransigence.
The BIMSTEC MVA, that will be key outcome of the groups fourth Summit in 2017 to celebrate 20 years of creation of BIMSTEC, will have all multi-modal features connecting Sri Lanka which is connected to rest of six members of grouping only through air or sea, persons familiar with the issue told ET. As part of this goal, the grouping also hopes to put in place BIMSTEC Framework Agreement on Transit, Trans-shipment, and Movement of Vehicular Traffic.
Intra-regional connectivity and BIMSTEC process was a key element in the agenda of visits by leaders of member statesBangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka to Indiain quick successions.
Eyeing better integration among the seven member states, BIMSTEC is also taking into consideration other national, bilateral, and regional efforts that are on-going in region, officials pointed out. This includes, among others, the BIG B (Bay of Bengal Industrial Growth Belt), which is a bilateral effort between Japan and Bangladesh, influencing the connectivity scenario in the region and is very much relevant to BIMSTEC. Besides BBIN MVA, a sub-regional initiative comprising four of seven BIMSTEC states is expected to complement BIMSTECs efforts amid SAARCs inability to make headway due to Pakistans intransigence on several issues including counter-terror mechanisms and connectivity initiatives, experts on the subject explained. BIMSTEC hopes to create a common security spacewhich SAARC failed to achieve in the past three decadesto deal with common security challenges.
Further, a recent study conducted by Jaipur-headquarter think tank CUTS International and BIMSTEC Secretariat based in Dhaka suggested that tourism corridors can be effective precursors to business corridors since regional tourism can help attract investment vis--vis building confidence among the political constituencies in the region.
Borders in the region need to be thinner than they are at present. Each country in the BIMSTEC region needs to work on small enablers at the borers, like better four lane roads, parking, testing, currency exchange, immigration, and other facilities at the borders which can be tackled at the domestic level before taking on regional challenges, the study further recommded.
One of the other important aspects is to look at waterways as part of the multi-modal connectivity network to enable sea access by land-locked countries and regions like Bhutan, Nepal, and the North Eastern states of India.
Maritime connectivity is extremely important for the BIMSTEC region, given its geography and also geo-strategic importance. Strengthening and enhancing cooperation on maritime and coastal shipping will be critical towards securing both, economic and security dividends. The key to connectivity within BIMSTEC lies in its history, and the member countries need to realign their historical alliance, reinvigorate historical nodes and hubs, and remove barriers that frustrate trade, investment, and people-to-people exchange, the study recommended.

Of cakes and bakes
Having discovered the charm if baking Rukshi Neticumara started her venture with baking and soon lured in a fan base. She established Butter Boutique which offers a wide range of cakes and desserts.
Anyone with a sweet tooth will find Butter Boutique a paradise. It does not offer the commonly found and traditional items but keeps up to date with the times and brings sweet delicacies from all over the world within reach of your fingertips.
Rukshi Nethicumara
What is unique about us is that our cake flavours are different from other places. We have 38 flavours in our cake menu. The Tres Leches is the item which is most in demand. We were the first to introduce it in Sri Lanka. It is a milk cake soaked in a mixture made of three types of milk, said Ruskshi explained.
She notes that Butter Boutique deals with anything sweet from cinnamon rolls to ice creams, Kulfi and popsicles. Their Salted Caramel Dark Chocolate, double chocolate fudge, Nutella cake and Arabian Night cakes too are hits with the customers.
I am inspired to bring these products to the menu through my travels, Rukshi adding that she is self taught. Her mother is a master chef and Rukshi has developed her love for food due to this reason.
She is always doing something new. Watching her inspired me to try my hand on gastronomy as well and unleash the adventurous side of me, she said.
She had initially started at the Good Market before moving onto Colombo 3. However Rukshi notes that they are actually seven years old because she has been making the products from home during the early stages.
Queried on what makes a quality cake Rukshi adds that it all comes down to the consistency of the cake.
You need to include good ingredients to make a quality product. We change our menu every day but we have about 15 different cakes alone each day excluding items like cookies, brownies and cinnamon rolls, she said adding that she does not wish to venture onto fast food areas like pastries and short eats. Butter Boutique is open from 9.30 am to 7.30 pm on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. On Fridays and Saturdays they are open from 9.30 am to 11 pm. Around 25 people can accommodate the shop.
People from all walks of life come here to fulfill their sweet cravings. We also cater to birthday parties and other festive occasions. However we do not do fondant cakes. If we do structures the whole product has to be made of cake. We do not decorate regiform structures, she explained. She also pointed out that their coffee which is called Niccolo Coffee is brought down from Melbourne. My partner, Karl Perera, came up with the name which turned out to be luck for me because now I have my own signature range, Rukshi noted. Asked about health issues which arise in consuming too much sweet items and Rukshi says that you cannot compromise with the ingredients of the cake to cater to those needs.
We do eggless items but not sugarless cakes. It is good to indulge in sweets to fulfill your cravings. Just know your limit and you will be fine, she added with a smile.

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation strike called off
The Petroleum Trade Unions called off the strike yesterday following discussions with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Petroleum Resourecs Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody and Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama were also present at the discussion.
Minister Chandima Weerakkody told the Daily News that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe assured that the MOU signed between Sri Lanka and India on the Trincomalee Oil Tank farms would be limited only to a political agreement.
He added that the assurance was also given to the trade unions that when the government intends to enter into a legal agreement, at a later stage, it would be done following discussions with the trade unions.
Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Trade Unions resorted to strike action on Monday over the alleged handing over of Oil Tank Farm in Trincomalle to India and several other issues. Fuel supplies to petrol stations around the country came to a halt as of yesterday (24). While the Trade Unions were engrossed in tense discussions with Minister Chandima Weerakkody and his officials in a bid to reach a speedy consensus over the issue. However,later they met with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe after which they decided to call off the strike.
CPC General Employees Union president Ranwala speaking to the Daily News after two hours of negotiations with Minister Weerakkody said that though there were certain agreements reached, there were no firm commitments. We know that the Minister does not have the authority to agree on all this and that the Prime Minister can override him. So we have asked that he get us a meeting with the President so we can discuss matters directly with him,the CPC General Employees Union president said.
The main points of contention between the unions and the government are; over the contract to modernise the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery where they have asked that the government consult with the union prior to engaging with any company, a decision on the China Bay Oil Tanks and whether they would be taken back from Lanka IOC and most importantly an assurance that the government would not sign an agreement with India over the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm.
Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Chairman, Nadun Fernando when contacted said nothing was finalised as yet.
In 2003, the government signed a tripartite agreement to develop the oil tank farm with India. As per the lease agreement, the oil tank farm with 99 tanks was to be handed over to the LIOC for use for a period of 35 years. Accordingly, they started using 14 tanks in the lower farm area. The remaining 84 tanks in the upper tank area remain unused.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who is set to visit India shortly is expected to discuss the probability of signing an MoU with India to develop the Trincomalee Port with major oil storage facilities.

Chastain reveals her greatest career goal
There is a story Jessica Chastain tells about a trip to Disneyland when she was 10 years old, and a stranger's act of kindness that made a lasting impact on her. As a child, she was an "ugly duckling", with red hair and freckles.
Her $100 clothing allowance had to last all year. It can be hard to credit  now she's on the cover of Vogue, walking the red carpet in Versace and Givenchy  but for the first half of her life, almost no one gave her a second glance.
She was with her family, waiting for Mickey and Minnie to pass by in the parade, when one of the dancers spotted her in the crowd. "I hated everything about the way I looked, and a stranger came up to me and said 'I love your hair'," Chastain says. "And her talking to me that way empowered me. The idea that I could go and help someone feel stronger and more powerful and maybe step forward in their lives is really exciting to me."
Chastain got her first big break in 2005 when Al Pacino cast her in the title role of Oscar Wilde's Salome. Each night, she stripped to perform the dance of the seven veils for 1400 people at the Wadsworth Theatre in Los Angeles. During the day, she reprised the role on a movie set, while a second film crew made a documentary about the process. Pacino played Herod and directed the enterprise in a kingly fury.
Casting agents noticed her performance, but the film, Wilde Salome, wasn't released until 2011, the year Chastain became "the unknown everyone's already sick of", as she puts it, when seven of her films came out in a few months. In May, she was in Cannes with her Tree of Life co-stars Sean Penn and Brad Pitt. By January she had been nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar for The Help.
The glut was a coincidence of scheduling, the result of Pacino and Tree of Life director Terrence Malick's glacial creative tempo, but it worked in Chastain's favour by showing off her range as an actor, equally capable of playing a southern socialite, an Israeli spy, a bereaved mother and the frightened wife of a madman. From the Shakespearean verse of Corionalus to the police procedural of Texas Killing Fields, she could do it all.
"I look at her movies, the performances in her career, and it's as if those characters are being played by different women, such is her ability to shape shift," says Niki Caro, who directed her in new film The Zookeeper's Wife. "She's peerless. She has so much skill and so much depth."
Chastain plays the title character, Antonina Zabinski, who ran the Warsaw Zoo with her husband Jan. When the Nazis invaded Poland, the reich's chief zoologist Lutz Heck shipped prized animals to Berlin and had most of the rest killed.
The Zabinskis suggested turning the zoo into a pig farm to feed the troops, and under cover of collecting scraps, smuggled more than 300 Jews from the Warsaw ghetto to safety.

CICT attracts first service  to Colombo
Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) recently welcomed the maiden call of CMA CGM Nabucco, the first vessel under the Ocean Alliance to call on the Port of Colombo.
The vessel operated by CMA CGM was the first in a new weekly service attracted to Colombo by CICT this year, and will operate under the USEC 3 Columbus Suez service of the Ocean Alliance, the company said.
The introduction of this new service demonstrates how CICT continues to play the anchor role of attracting new volumes through the Port of Colombo, CICT CEO Ray Ren said.This is in line with our concept and focus of marketing the port internationally as one unit for the benefit of all terminals, thereby enhancing the position of the Port of Colombo as a major common-user transshipment hub.
Making the welcome address on board the ship, the Head of Commercial and Marketing of Colombo International Container Terminals Catriona Jayasundera emphasised the critical role played by CICT in drawing synergies from the parent company CMPort to attract the new service to the Port of Colombo. She disclosed that the global marketing reach of CMPort working together with CICT over the last few years had enabled the Port of Colombo to move up the global rankings to the Number 23 position in the world.
With more than 40 maritime services and 323 ships, Ocean Alliance is the largest operational agreement ever made between shipping companies. It offers 17 services on the Asian-Northern Europe, Mediterranean, Red Sea and Middle Eastern trades, and 23 services on the North American trades making it the number one Alliance on the Transpacific. The CMA CGM Group has the biggest market share in this agreement deploying a fleet of 119 ships among the most efficient on their respective trades.
The first and currently the only deep water terminal in South Asia equipped with facilities to handle the largest vessels afloat, CICT reported a throughput of 2 million TEUs for the 12 months ending 31stDecember 2016, achieving impressive YoY growth of 28 per cent in volume.

What actually happened to NCMC students
I refer to the letter from Prof C Deepal Mathew published on April 12. It is not correct to state that the medical students protest evolved into an armed struggle to overthrow the government.
After the 1971 insurgency, JVP activities have increased in 1986. Signing of Indian Peace Accord on July 1987 made the matters worse. The armed struggle was geared in full by JVPers between 1987 and 1989.
This was led by Rohana Wijeweera supporters, and not by students.
Please do not pass the blame on to them, Professor Mathew! A common examination was held and the students of NCMC scored good results. When the final examination was to be held, the Colombo Medical students protested against NCMC students.
The NCMC students had to undergo clinical training as well as local violence. Between 1987 and 1989 there was unrest in the circles of business establishments, government departments and universities. These institutes were shut down on a regular basis.
President Ranasinghe Premadasa then nationalized NCMC to satisfy the public as well as medical students. But the foreign students were not sent back. No damages were compensated. Most local students went abroad and sat for examinations held by foreign universities who recognized their knowledge.
This move by the foreign universities was appreciated. Our concern, quite naturally, is then why the same cannot be executed in the case of SAITM too. I admit that SLMC should regulate medical education. But remember, Supreme Court is above all. Even parliament must not try to overrule the Supreme Courts decisions.
Let us, then, wait for the verdict of Supreme Court. Please do not make it a political issue.

Counsel objects to D.E.W. Gunasekara making personal observations
Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva objected to allowing former Parliamentarian D.E.W. Gunasekara to making his personal observations on the Treasury Bond issue at the Presidential Commission yesterday.
De Silva rose to object when Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera asked if Gunasekara has any observations to make on the issue before the conclusion of leading the evidence for the day.
Former Parlimentarian D.E.W. Gunasekara was testifying before the Presidential Commission to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds yesterday. He was the Chairman of the first COPE subcommittee appointed to probe into the Treasury Bond issue.
Responding to S.A.S.G. de Livera, Gunasekara said that he does have observations and his personal opinions on the issue, but they would be irrelevant to the mandate of the Presidential Commission.
Legal Counsel to former CBSL Governor Arjun Mahendran, Attorney Chanaka de Silva pointed out that making such observations are irrelevant to a fact finding Commission.
I thought this witness has only come to produce the documents that were lead before this Commission, de Silva said. If that was the case, we didnt have to summon MP Gunasekara, we could have asked the Secretary to Parliament to produce these documents, he also said.
Objecting to de Silvas submission, S.A.S.G. de Livera said the former is trying to dictate to the Commission to which de Silva replied, he is only making a submission and that he has the right to do so.
Supreme Court Justice K.T. Chitrasiri said that de Silva should be allowed to make submissions and that nobody can dictate the Commission.
In what capacity can he give evidence He is not a member of the Central Bank. He has no idea as to what transpired there in relation to the Treasury Bond issue.
He was only the Chairman of the COPE Subcommittee which recorded evidence produced before this Commission today, Counsel Chanaka de Silva pointed out.
De Silva also said that if in fact the Commission is to take opinions of certain individuals, they should have the relevant expertise on the subject at hand. Since Gunasekara does not have the expertise, his personal opinions are irrelevant to the Commissions mandate, de Silva said.
He further said that on this basis, it is against the general norm to allow MP Gunasekara to make opinions and observations on the Treasury bond issue in his testimony to the Commission.
If Gunasekara is to make any irrelevant observations, the Commission can stop him from doing so, S.A.S.G.de Livera pointed out.
Asked by Supreme Court Justice K.T.Chitrasiri if there are any solid facts that he wants to draw the attention of the Commission, MP Gunasekara said he takes the same position as De Silva does.
The evidence led by the COPE Subcommittee chaired by me was accepted to be admissible by the new COPE committee chaired by MP Sunil Handunnetti. The only thing I have to say is that the Presidential Commission should consider the evidence given before the COPE Subcommittee chaired by me, in to consideration when preparing the final report, former MP D.E.W. Gunasekara said.
Meanwhile, asked as to why the first COPE Subcommittee was not able to produce a complete report on the Treasury Bond issue, MP Gunasekara said they were not able to do so as Parliament was dissolved in June 2015 for the General Election.
We were requested by the Speaker of Parliament to prepare an interim report on the proceedings of the case. So on June 25 and 26, we prepared an interim report on the progress of the COPE Subcommittee on the Treasury Bond issue. However, Parliament was dissolved on June 26,2015. So I let the Speaker know that we are not able to produce the interim report, Gunasekara explained.
Asked on if some members of the first COPE Subcommittee did not agree with the interim report, former MP Gunasekara said three of the seven members who were present at the final meeting held on June 26, objected to the interim report.
He pointed out their objection was on producing an interim report instead of a full report only. Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera led the evidence.
Central Bank Director of Human Resources Kalyani Gunatilake and former Assistant Central Bank Governor B.Karunatilake are to appear before the Presidential Commission today.

The Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara ordered Cinnamon Garden Police yesterday to file charge sheets against National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa and six other party activists for allegedly providing leadership to a protest.
The protest blocked the main roads at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, causing disturbance to the people and the normal flow of traffic. On February 6, 2016, the NFF staged a protest march against the visit of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein.
Six suspects including NFF leader and Colombo District MP Wimal Weerawansa, Jayantha Samaraweera, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Piyasiri Wijenayake, Roger Seneviratne, Mohammed Muzammil and Don Lusian are currently out on bail. The seventh suspect Chaminda Jayalal was not present in Court yesterday and Court was informed that the police were yet to trace his whereabouts.
Police informed Court that the suspects who organized the procession had failed to obtain prior permission from police to organise the march.
They further alleged that the organizers had also used loudspeakers without a valid license. Police further submitted to Court that the suspects provided leadership to a protest which blocked the main road at Bauddhaloka Mawatha towards Havelock Town, causing disturbance to the people and the normal flow of traffic.
Presidents Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe with counsel Kapila Gamage appeared for the suspects.

CPC strike creates panic
The queues for petrol increased with the midday sun, as the public responded to the latest fuel shortage. This time, rather than a decrease in fuel supply, workers attached to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) protested against an impending deal between India and Sri Lanka in the islands East.
India is set to finalise agreements on co-managing with Sri Lanka the remaining 84 tanks at a WW II storage facility in Trincomalee. The Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) currently manages fifteen of the 99 storage tanks and workers protested against the deal, alleging that it will give India an unfair advantage.
As the disagreement looms between the government and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Trade Unions, which organised the strike that came into effect at midnight on Sunday, the public has to face the consequences.
Daily News spoke to several consumers queuing up for fuel at petrol sheds in Colombo, to find out their varied views on the matter.

## Title: Fairway Waste Management on  mission to transform Colombo into a waste-free clean city

Fairway Waste Management on  mission to transform Colombo into a waste-free clean city
In the aftermath of the recent unfortunate incident in Meethotamulla, the Waste Free-Clean City project in Karadiyana, which has been awarded to Fairway Waste Management (PVT) Ltd, is a timely measure towards ensuring that such a national calamity will never occur in future again. Following the launch of this Project by the government, Fairway Waste Management has begun the task of putting their plans into action.
Introduction
Fairway Waste Management has come up with a proposal to develop a solid waste processing facility at the Thumbowila-Karadiyana landfill site located in the Western Province of Sri Lanka. This will be an integrated waste processing facility to process 500 tons per day of fresh municipal solid waste received at the site. The proposed facility is designed to maximize energy production while having minimum environmental impact by optimizing the recovery of energy and nutrients in the waste stream. The processing facility will reduce the amount of waste diverted to landfills by as much as 80% by mass and 90% by volume, whilst the fraction, which will be disposed in a suitably prepared landfill is mostly inert with no ill effects on the environment.
The design consists of a biological treatment plant that will process the fast degradable, high moisture content organic waste in a wet fermentation anaerobic digestion system. This system will treat a maximum of 115 tons of fast degradable organic waste per day. The remaining waste will be diverted to an incinerator facility having a capacity of 425 tons per day.
The project will supply a total of 79,000,000 kWh of electricity to the grid per year. This is sufficient to supply the demands of 35,000 households (based on the World Bank per capita energy use in Sri Lanka). In addition to electricity, the plant will generate liquid and solid fertilizer from the biological treatment of the organic fraction of the waste. It will produce 40,000 tons of liquid fertilizer per year, which will be processed to a high quality bio-fertilizer for the local market.
The environmental and social impacts of the current situation surrounding the management of waste disposal
Currently the mixed municipal waste as well as the source segregated household and commercial waste from eight local authorities is disposed at the Karadiyana waste-processing site. A small fraction of the source-segregated waste is processed as compost. All of the mixed waste is land filled. While the landfill is a managed landfill it does not meet the modern standards for a landfill by any measure. The site, which has been operational for several decades, contains more than 2,000,000 tons of waste that is polluting the surrounding waterways, ground water sources and the air. The environmental externalities due to open dumping caused by the site are palpable. Fairway Waste Management has estimated the monetary cost of the externalities, to the public, due to air pollution, GHG emissions etc. to be approximately LKR 6000/ton. The actual cost to the Country is much higher due to the negative social impact, cost of health care (attributed to negative effects of the dump on surrounding communities), present value of future cost of remediation, cost for law and order arising from public protests, opportunity cost of the land etc.
The Waste-Free Clean City Project
This is an initiative by the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development to reduce waste as well as to find better and modern waste disposal solutions. The basic idea is to implement and enforce the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse Recycle) principal and to effectively implement sustainable and environmentally sound end-of-the-pipe waste solutions, such as mass burn incineration and biological treatment facilities. Sri Lanka has a long way to go. A city will never be waste free, however, we can avoid piling the waste in landfills or rather minimize it. Incineration is the only way to do this and it is a must have solution.
Workings of the Waste-to-Energy Concept
As far as Fairway Waste Management is concerned waste has an intrinsic value. It contains recoverable nutrients as well as energy that can be recovered through thermo physical or biological processes. All things when supplied with enough heat will burn releasing most often more energy than that was required to start the combustion process. One can think of a roadside garbage pile that is set on fire with a single match. If there is enough material with low moisture content it will burn releasing energy as heat in to the atmosphere. A mass burn incinerator facility is simply a system that recovers the heat and converts it to electricity. It also cleanses the smoke and particulate matter that is released in the combustion process. It is possible to incinerate all of the waste but doing so is not the most environmentally sound solution, and it can be inefficient to burn the high moisture content waste consisting of fast degradable organic waste. It is for this reason that Fairway Waste Management has incorporated a biological process to treat the organic fraction so that not only energy but also nutrients are recovered from the waste stream. The decomposition of organic matter can occur in the presence of oxygen, aerobic decomposition, and in the absence, anaerobically. Anaerobic decomposition is a naturally occurring process that produces biogas-containing methane as a byproduct. In fact anaerobic decomposition is an ongoing process deep in the Karadiyana landfill, which produces biogas. Biogas consists of methane, CO2 and water vapor. Methane is also known as natural gas that escapes in to the atmosphere where it acts as a potent green house gas. However, if the process is controlled and the bio gas is collected it can be combusted to produce electricity. Fairway Waste Management will install the largest and most advanced anaerobic digestion system in the region in Karadiyana to treat as much as 36,000 tons of organic waste per year. Additionally as a byproduct the plant will produce 45,000 tons/year of liquid fertilizer and 7500 tons/year of solid fertilizer.
Parties Involved
Fairway Holdings and Sustainable Alternatives (Pvt) Ltd formed a consortium to bid for the project when the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development called for proposals in 2016. The project was supported by numerous other government agencies such as: The Waste Management Authority, The Western Province - Provincial Government, The Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, The Urban Development Authority
Technology
The technology involved, mostly consists of a mass burn incineration with energy recovery boiler and an advanced flue gas cleaning system meeting European Union emission standards. The incinerator is a moving grate type with a four-stage heat recovery boiler. The flue gas cleaning system will assure that the emissions exceed the standards required in the country and will meet EU2010 emission standards. The plant design is based on The European Union guidelines for Waste Incineration. Fairway Waste Management will be utilizing expert consultants from Denmark and the Netherlands to design and commission this project.
Environmental, Social and Economical Benefits of the Final Outcome
There will be a significant reduction of the volume of landfill by more than 90%. The project will produce green electricity to power more than 35,000 households. Apart from saving the country's fossil fuel (coal and heavy diesel) used to produce power, the project will be an immediate benefit to the communities that live around the Karadiyana garbage site. At the moment the site emits large volumes of methane from waste that is digesting anaerobically. It can be seen bubbling out of puddles of leachate. Methane is a potent green house gas with an environmental impact that is 20 times more than that of CO2. While the project will not stop the current level of emissions immediately, the organic waste that will be kept out of the landfill will stop future emissions from occurring. It will eliminate the leachate that now washes into the ground and surrounding water bodies and it will also reduce the levels of SOx and NOx (harmful GHG emissions) in the landfill area. The lack of fresh waste in an open dump will eliminate the rodents and mosquitoes that can breed and spread diseases. The commissioning of the project will be the beginning of the reclamation process of the land that at present is an eye sore to the surrounding communities.
Public Outreach
Fairway Waste Management will contribute to capacity building by working closely with local universities on the project. As of now there are several academics who are experts in solid waste management, biological waste processing and thermal processing who are working with the government and with Fairway Waste Management on this project. These relationships will no doubt be further strengthened by actively involving research students and academic staff on areas of mutual interest. This facility will be used to encourage and help the academic staff from universities to learn about the latest technologies in waste management. The plant operators will be trained by the best in the industry and the engineering staff will be hired locally to run the plant with specialized training provided to make the operation and maintenance of the plant a local effort. It can be confidently stated that Fairway Waste Management's CSR efforts will contribute towards building a community of experts that will lead the waste-processing sector in the country in future.

Favouring frivolous humor
Imagine Alec Baldwin in a babys body, wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase! If youve loved Baldwin in 30 Rock, The Boss Baby might be your cup of tea.
Directors Hendel Butoy and Tom McGrath test your threshold for quirky stories. At the Templeton home, seven-year-old Tim is struggling to garner the attention of his parents after the arrival of a baby who is always, inexplicably, wearing a suit.
The baby turns out to be a corporate at Baby Corp, where human offspring are produced. After coming to an agreement that the baby will exist after completing his mission on earth the two brothers get together to fight Puppy Co., which produces babies biggest competition: puppies.
Endless chases
The story itself turns into quite a clich with an evil villain and a little boy and his side kick trying to save the day. This is a movie which is typically made with the younger audience in mind though it will bring out a few laughs out of grown ups too.
However the endless chases between the kids and the evil workers at Puppy Co tired the viewers.
There is too much monotony in this game that you cannot help glancing at the clock and wish for the film to end.
Despite targeting kids through its plot and execution, the one-liners in the film are clearly meant for adults. For example at one time when Tim tells the baby where babies come from it is clear that he makes a suggestion which is suitable for adults.
Some of the behavioural traits of the babies too suggest that the movie is made to rope in the adult audience as well.
Bland angle
The film clearly has so much potential which the story angle it starts off in. The concept too may have sounded like a winner given that two of the most lovable huggable beings, babies and puppies, are pitted against each other. It also has lots of space for humour.
However all of this gets washed away with the bland angle it takes. The Boss Baby is so caught up in being silly that it remains blithely unaware of its detachment from a childs psyche and the possibility of being perceptive.
Loosely based on a picture book of the same name, written and illustrated by Marla Frazee, the film is visually enjoyable.
Theres a lot of physical comedy too, some of which is funny. But the film seldom makes use of its strengths or its three dimensional effects.

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake speaking at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce highlighted prospects for increasing bilateral trade and U.S. investment in Sri Lanka at a breakfast round-table meeting hosted by the US Chamber of Commerce. Minister Karunanayake was in Washington leading the Sri Lanka delegation to the IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings.
Alluding to many investment opportunities in areas such as infrastructure development, agro processing, health care, export oriented manufacturing and the tourism sector, Minister Karunanayake outlined the business-friendly policies adopted by the Government of Sri Lanka to position the country as the gateway to Asia.
He discussed the benefits that US companies in Sri Lanka could avail of under the existing and potential Free Trade Agreements with countries in the region, which can provide a larger market in the region beyond Sri Lanka.
Karunanayake presented an overview of the progress in macroeconomic fundamentals of the country, which are integral cornerstones of a favourable investment climate and urged U.S. companies to look at Sri Lanka not only as an investment destination but also as a country with a high quality of life with excellent amenities for rest and recreation.
He pointed out that the government is putting in place mechanisms to support entrepreneurship, technology adoption, trade diversification and environmentally friendly industries and urged U.S. businesses to forge partnerships with the Sri Lankan private sector paving the way to strengthen business links over the next decade.
In his concluding remarks, Ambassador Prasad Kariyawasam reiterated that with its market-friendly economic policies, geostrategic location and high quality physical environment, Sri Lanka has become a business-friendly, eminently liveable and welcoming destination in the region.
The round-table discussion was attended among others, by senior officials of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce South Asia Team, senior representatives from Coca Cola, Exxon Mobil, Ventech Engineering LLCs, McLarty Associates, Bower Group Asia, USIBC, CIPE, Mastercard, FedEx, Trimble Navigation Ltd.
The United States continues to be Sri Lankas largest export market. Bilateral trade turnover currently stands at approximately USD 3.3 billion and the U.S. accounts for 28 percent of Sri Lankas total exports in 2016.

Foreign travel check on MPs
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's edict restricting UNP ministers and MPs foreign travel will no doubt be endorsed by a majority of the public. The Premier has ordered that foreign travel of MPs not to exceed three times a year per Minister or MP. Needless to say most of these trips are mere jaunts, more often than not with family members in tow. There are two categories of foreign visits undertaken by politicians. There are trips sponsored by foreign embassies for so called study tours and workshops with all expenses paid. This was the case when a western embassy sponsored a series of foreign visits to Ministers and MPs some time ago to acquaint themselves with the federal system practised in the host country. Upon their return after enjoying the hospitality of that country certain MPs went onto lambaste the federal system which needless to state was in bad taste.
The other category of foreign trips undertaken by MPs are paid for by the tax payer and thus there should be an evaluation of the cost benefit factor of these trips (The exception being the foreign travel of the country's Foreign Minister, although, we once had a Foreign Minister who was noted for his almost weekly visits abroad always accompanied by spouse and brood. That worthy also once undertook a visit to Iceland, a country far removed from Sri Lanka's orbit).
Not just parliamentarians, even provincial councillors and members of local bodies undertake frequent foreign jaunts with tax payers money, the trips billed as study tours. Sometime ago members of a local government body took turns to visit a certain country to undertake a study on garbage management. Nobody in authority sought to inquire as to the outcome of this study tour or whether the country gained by this exercise. Needless to say, if the combined knowledge of all these members who undertook this tour were put to use perhaps we would have been spared the tragedy that befell Meethotamulla. There were many such foreign trips being made by provincial councillors and LG members at the expense of the tax payer with no back up check to verify if they or the country, benefited by such trips. Ditto for our erstwhile peoples representatives in the august assembly of parliament some of whom are abroad even when important Bills are taken up for discussion, often related to the subject of their ministries. Hence, it is time that someone in authority cracked the whip and the Premier calling the riot act no doubt would come in a for praise, although some would wonder why MPs have to go abroad as much as three times a year - the ceiling imposed.
Of course there would be those who will contend that MPs who had entered parliament for the first time, particularly those representing the rural outbacks, should be given the opportunity for foreign travel, if not to widen their horizons, then at least to make up for lost opportunities. This perhaps is the basis followed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa when he included in his ample entourage on foreign travel MPs and functionaries who possessed no clue as to the subject matter of these visits. There were businessmen, artistes and long term loyalists included in such tours, running up astronomical bills. How such inclusions brought any benefit to the country was anyone's guess.
Be that as it may, while no one can begrudge foreign travel for ministers and MPs all such travel ought to bring some form of returns to the country to justify such visits. Ditto for provincial council and local government members. More often than not MPs go abroad to visit their children who are either studying or settled down with their families. This cannot be done at the expense of the tax payer.
WW back with a bang
National Freedom Front Leader and Joint Opposition stalwart Wimal Weerawansa, after lying low for a brief period following his release from remand prison on bail, has returned to his usual self, making high octane pronouncements and directing his fusillade at the government. Weerawansa in the meantime also displayed his soft side, telling reporters that he planned to visit the Welikada prison next week to meet with his prisoner colleagues who gave him moral support while behind bars. All this, while storm clouds were gathering within the National Freedom Front over Weerawansa, for the second time deciding to call of his hunger strike'.
According to reports, at the politburo meeting of the NFF, some stalwarts had questioned the prudence of WW calling off the hunger strike, putting his own credibility and that of the party on the line. They of course are justified in their claim.
Mahatma Gandhi, popularly called Gandhi Ji used his famous satyagraha campaign of non violence to bring the mighty British Empire to heel. Local cardboard Ghandhis seems to have rendered this time honoured non violent form of protest to irrelevance by trying to imitate the great savant at every turn. That is why Weerawansa has even earned the ire of his own party men.

Foreigners to be subjected to health checks
Rules and regulations will be introduced soon to check the health status of foreigners who apply for resident visas to stay in Sri Lanka for some time for work, studies etc, acting Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, he said at the moment, all workplaces check the health of their employees, especially for Tuberculosis (TB), HIV/AIDS and Malaria. Laws will be introduced soon to conduct a full health check-up for resident visa applicants.
Anti Malaria Campaign Director Dr. H. D. B. Herath said usually all Sri Lankans travelling abroad obtain vaccination against Yellow Fever and Malaria. The vaccination against Yellow Fever is done at the Health Office of the Colombo Harbour. The vaccination against Malaria is available at the Medical Centre located at BIA.
The Malaria threat is in certain parts of Thailand and India but visiting Bangkok or New Delhi does not pose a major threat to the health of passengers.
At present, the main threat of importing Malaria to Sri Lanka emanates from Chinese workers arriving in Sri Lanka after serving in African countries, he added.

Four-century old charm
William Shakespeare has become a domestic term in Sri Lanka, despite his obscure works. He is the widest known English playwright in the world scene as well. How could one man have dominated the cultural landscape for centuries with such fame Scribes from many plains of life share one theory to a clichd extent: Shakespearean themes are universal.
Here is a man who lived only for five decades (from 1564 to 1616), yet his legacy has influenced the mankind for four centuries. That said, William Shakespeare still dominates the written word of English language with a metaphorical iron fist. No other writer, let alone a playwright, managed to reach even closer. If there be one, that would only be a text: the Holy Bible.
Shakespeare stands alone as the one man who dominates the literature of the worlds most used language. It is simply impressive how this single man of letters survived centuries with such reputation from the academia as well as the common man. His plays have held influence over western literature inasmuch as he is still alive today.
A portrait of William Shakespeare is pictured in London, on March 9, 2009. The portrait, painted in 1610, is believed to be the only surviving picture of William Shakespeare painted in his lifetime.
Thanks to a few Shakespeare enthusiasts such as Bandula Vithanage, K G Karunathilaka and Tony Ranasinghe, Sri Lankans are now familiar with Shakespeares well-received plays: Othello, Hamlet, The Twelfth Night, The Merchant of Venice and Romeo and Juliet.
The world knows him more as a playwright and less as a poet. Above anything of that sort, Shakespeare was a writer. Was he in possession of a secret formula to become the most celebrated writer  something like a magic potion Probably, or probably not. Shakespeares own quotes throw some light towards us.
Have more than thou showest; speak less than thou knowest. (King Lear: Act 1, Scene 4, Page 6)
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice. (Hamlet: Act 1, Scene 3, Page 3)
In two plays and two different lines, Shakespeare lays emphasis on one point: pay attention to what others have to say more than your own. He would have been a silent listener, extracting the juice as well as essence from gossip that others feasted on.
There is more to Shakespeares script though. He deconstructed the ancient text into plainer and more enchanting style of his times. His language is plain That may sound eccentric at this age when everyone needs a paraphrased edition to understand the Bards lines. It is still not far from possibility, if you have a general command of English.
You can still understand Shakespeare, only if you care to bury your head in these lines written four centuries ago. Take a breath while reading his sentences, which in turn will offer you breathtaking proverbs, phrases, metaphors, idioms and any figure of speech you name.
He continues to cast a spell on the western thinking, probably only second in rank to the Holy Bible. Even with no typewriter in possession - let alone modern word processors - he penned about 37 plays and 154 sonnets. That figure is colossal, in contrast to the short lifespan Shakespeare had. Shakespeare filled his text with inspiring characters. One modern playwright is inspired by the Fools in Shakespearean plays. Another playwright would re-interpret the famous Shakespearean characters.
William Shakespeare was not the only playwright of his time. He had a fair share of contemporaries.
They outsmarted him as well at times. Yet, Shakespeare was left to be the only scribe best remembered in western literary sphere. How and why are researched extensively across the globe.
Shakespeare had an amazing knack for capturing the human essence in his sources. To borrow from his own glossary, he fed the readers with milk of human kindness. The dramatist within him took liberties remoulding his sources into universal human experiences. That is how his plays have varied plots. Shakespeare syringed the power of creativity into words of his predecessors.
That earned Shakespeare wrath too, from his contemporaries.
The Guardian cites a diarist who was born 11 years after Shakespeare died. The diarist was an academic who looks down on Shakespeare and notes that the only good thing is that his plays took well. The diarists account aside, the literary circles are not short of scholars who maintain that Shakespeare was not much of a writer. There could be some truth to their verdict, as the Bard had contemporaries like Christopher Marlowe who claimed better scholarship.
Along with the diarists account, the Guardian also publishes an interesting note:
For a man famous in his own lifetime there is little documentary evidence for Shakespeares life and times. The plays would scarcely have survived if his friends and fellow actors had not gathered together every scrap of every play they could find - drafts, prompt scripts, scribbled actors parts, and 17 plays not known in any other version - into the precious First Folio published in 1623, seven years after Shakespeares death.
Now that is the surprising part about this much-spoken-of man of the 20th century. But then he was born in a period when information power was toddling.
The universality is not merely a concept when it comes to Shakespeare. His plays influenced more and more creative writers, who remoulded his plot outlines. That happened mostly in cinema and tele media. Romeo and Juliet, for instance, inspired many versions of the same plot. That reached somewhat a crescendo with Leonardo de Caprio carrying a gun. Examples are aplenty where Shakespeare has been influential, inspiring, and subject to distortion.
And today, Shakespeare is now an institution. He penned plays and poems, but the bard is extensively researched in wider scopes of literature.
Many, among you, need to enjoy Shakespeare on stage. Another group will be content with reading him between lines. For some, Shakespeare has to be visited in Stratford. What matters most though is the amazing fact that one man - a writer at that - could claim such a vast literary dominance for four centuries.
Yes, that is no go figure. Four centuries and still a living icon, Shakespeare would continue to inspire, motivate and encourage even the techno-savvy audience with his insightful expressions.

garbage dumping continues despite protests
Dumping of garbage in Muthurajawela area was a high level decision, said Wattala Divisional Secretary W.G Premalal.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday he said that he was not properly informed of such a decision. Premalal further said that the Colombo Municipal Council was dumping garbage in a private land in that area.
Protests in Muthurajawela reserve continued for the third day yesterday as the CMC continued dumping of garbage despite public protests.
The protesters said that dumping of garbage continued with the permission of the government authorities.
They said that the land is a part of Muthurajawela wetlands and it needs to be protected. Many protests were staged over Colombos garbage crisis over the past few days.
At Nugape off Wattala (Muthurajawela), residents started a strong protest on Saturday (22) to prevent dumping of garbage in a 35 acre private land in the area.
Despite several attempts made by Daily News to contact Chairman of CMC V.K Anura for a comment, he was not available for comment.

Garbage in, garbage out
The natural stink bomb exploded at Meethotamulla and its tragedy seems to have propelled a valuable point for a serious discussion not only among the intelligentsia but also among every Jack and Jill, Tom, Dick and Harry at the tea kiosks. Pardon me if I have happened to hurt the sentiments of any one by any name in my list. All the names are from the English nomenclature and my mind goes back to the English rule in Sri Lanka.
Now I am compelled by the circumstances to contemplate why the British rulers had not given us freedom for such a long time. Cleanliness of the English gentlemen is unquestionable. Our half-naked fakir from India got the point right in hand and he launched his non-violence movement exploiting this specific disposition of the English gentleman. Whole India was spread with human excreta and made the country very stinky. The man made stink bomb India drove them away to their stench free land of their own. In giving freedom to Sri Lanka, they might have thought that ours was a nation that we couldnt manage our things properly. It seems the ground reality behind the Meethotamulla tragedy.
Meethotamulla tragedy
The reaction of the members of the legislature and the general public drives home the idea that both parties are not matured enough to take quick actions for an issue of this nature. The resilience of the people of America proved the world their integrity and the national mind set beyond doubt when they were bombed. Sri Lanka is a country lagging behind most of the other countries in many an instance. Our country is poignantly lacking the knowledge and experience to draft even an application for Grade One school admissions. Every year, so many amendments are made to the annual budget. Whole administration seems to be in an inescapable labyrinth. Almost all the governments have been entangled in this perennial tragedy.
The latest tragedy which has raised its ugly head seems to me not anything of that sort, but the grave crisis democracy is facing in Sri Lanka. Meethotamulla tragedy could have been really averted if the relevant authorities had taken the necessary actions in the nick of time. That is history. The die is cast.
The most chaotic situation is that, the very same rulers, not the public, should take the responsibly for dragging the people into an undemocratic path. At the drop of a hat, people acquire the public highway without an iota of obedience to the law of the country. Public are inconvenienced almost all the days of the month.
During the last few years, what we noticed was that the oratory skills of some self-appointed patriots and unpractical legal eagles, not to mention some literary fossils and a dozen of pseudo intellectuals were dragging the country into an abysmal depth of political ruin. In this light, the writer thinks it is high time to open a discussion on the democratic ideals that we have to uphold as a nation.
It is undeniable that oratory is only the beginning of free speech. It could be employed as a medium to reach an end. That end tool is stupidly used by our politically immature leaders like the same way how proverbially a monkey would use the razor. Examination of opinions is adroitly done by the national press today. For that, our encomiums should go to the learned editors of the national newspapers whose papers play the vital role of the watch dog, veritably.
Examination of opinions is a fundamental necessity of man and its immediate functioning has become a vital issue in the present context because some sections of the society have recently started to abuse it in the worst manner even by repeatedly saying that they would topple the democratically elected government by muscle power. They are really talking to the gallery, yet its threat to the sentiments of the right thinking rational minded citizens is immense.
Power hungry politicians
Most of the members of the legislature and their cohorts have come down to ZIMRI level. Freedom of expression has to be guarded as the country is passing through a turbulent time. Management of the government at turbulent times needs constant vigilance and rational thinking. Freedom of the ass shouldnt be the maxim. That is the example our ancestors have put into good use.
The law-abiding far sighted senior citizens ought to save a peaceful country for the posterity. Expression of opinions should essentially bear the seal of correction, not creating chaos in the country at a time, the concerned parties are making a discernible attempt to take the country out of a treacherous bog. The emerging international scenario of the unprecedented international cooperation should be harnessed to the fullest. Liberal democracy should be taken in its true spirit.
Socrates once said, The unexamined life is unfit to be lived by man. These great philosophical saying are grossly unheeded by power hungry politicians and their goons. Liberty is sanctified by these concepts. If the present hooligans pay an iota of attention to the current state of the country they have to tolerate the errors to serve democracy in the long run.
It is high time to inculcate the democratic values in the mind of the people and the misled politicians because the benefits of free expressions are many. If the opposing parties could be taken to a common forum and their opinions are made to listen and discussed deeply they could be ceased to become children before the intelligentsia. It is the need of the hour. It is mandatory in the present context. Unheeded, our men seem to becoming savages and uncivilized men in the near future at this rate. The real value of democracy may become vibrant if the examination of opinions becomes a constant exercise. Vituperative politics should come to a virtual end. Preservation of democracy of a county depends on understanding the principles of democracy by the people. It is regrettable that even the legislators seem to have forgotten its cardinal principles and the Salient features. MARK TWAIN in his well-acclaimed novel THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER says that people change in every ten years. Our leaders who have mastered law and philosophies engage in foul verbal fights and openings of toilets and other negligible undertakings without maintaining their intellectual decorum. It is very calamitous to a country in the long run. Opposition is indispensable. It is a vital necessity in the smooth functioning of a democracy. Moreover, it is constitutional. Yet the abuse of being opposed is proved very catastrophic, because the views expressed by the opponents seem to be rubbish.
Democracy is poignantly turned upside down by the demi-gods of democracy in Sri Lanka. It is the conundrum. Our wounds are getting cured from gross autocracy very slowly after one and a half decades. The country is in the right direction and democracy is playing its role vibrantly. Agitations at every junction, demonstrations, strikes.
Work to rules, sick notes, sabotage, going to GENEVA and getting lost there, mud throwing, hooting to the respected parliamentarians, law suits and many other democratic functions are in array, unprecedentedly. Democracy seems to be repleting. Yet, some dark clouds seem to be looming over us. The frightening murderous drums are heard at the distance. I pray God for the safety of my sons and daughters.
As the writer has repeatedly mentioned in this article, an effective opposition is the need of the hour, yet it must follow the basic principles of democracy. I have sometimes observed the opposition behaving like unruly mobs. A democratically elected government should be made to govern by consent. It is the cornerstone of democracy. Getting governed by coercion is unacceptable and should be vehemently crushed for the welfare of the majority. In this aspect, the party in power should have the majority.
The president and the immediate confidantes leave no stone unturned to meet that demand. Yet, it doesnt seem fruitful. The country is at stake. Democracy is sitting on a volcano, literally. Under these circumstances, the party in power should not hurt the sentiments of the opposition for silly matters. Some uncontrolled culvert mouths do this perennial crime almost as a habit. Sometimes, it runs in the family. It is ruinous. Listening to the minority in democracy is a noble aspect. Their constructive criticism is vital for the smooth functioning of democracy.
There seems a ray of hope in the eastern sky. So, lets be optimistic till democracy takes its noble image in the promised land. It is very difficult to teach old dogs new tricks. Yet we must give democracy a try.
Old order changeth, yielding place to new.

GMOA to lodge complaint with FCID
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) hopes to lodge a complaint with the FCID in connection with the alleged misuse of public funds by the Health Minister and the Higher Education Minister in order to give publicity to a fraudulent company, GMOA Secretary Dr.Nalin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head quarters in Colombo yesterday, Dr.Zoysa said that the two ministers are now allegedly using public funds to insert newspaper advertisements on behalf of SAITM, which is a fraudulent company owned by an individual.
This is purely an offence when compared to the incidents investigated by the FCID during the recent past under the Public Property Act in connection with the previous regime,the GMOA Secretary.
According to Dr.Zoysa, even the President had accepted the fact that an institution such as SAITM cannot be owned by an individual.
It is hilarious how the two ministers take technical decisions that should be taken by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
What they should do now is not publishing newspaper advertisements on behalf of SAITM, but, ask forgiveness from the nation for not revealing and presenting accurate facts before the judiciary, he said.
The authorities should clarify to the country how the act of publishing newspaper advertisements allegedly by the two ministers using public funds is not an offense under the Public Property Act,Dr.Zoysa added.

Govt allocates Rs. 30 m for Malaria prevention
The government has allocated Rs. 30 million this year to prevent Malaria from affecting the country again, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Sri Lanka was certified as a Malaria-free country by the World Health Organization (WHO) in September, last year.
Addressing a press conference held at the Government Information Department in Colombo yesterday, he said usually the government allocates Rs. 10 million for Malaria control every year. However, the government allocated over Rs. 83 million for Malaria as recurrent expenditure. The WHO has formulated a 15-year plan from 2015 to 2030 to eliminate Malaria.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, the last death due to Indigenous Malaria reported from Sri Lanka was in 2007. The last Malaria case due to Indigenous Malaria reported from Sri Lanka was in 2012. A Malaria patient was detected from Colombo South Teaching Hospital (Kalubowila) recently, and he was a foreigner. In 2015, a total of 429,000 Malaria patients died in the world.
Malaria is prevalent in 91 other countries. Malaria can be imported to Sri Lanka again from one or more of these countries through tourists, business travelers, members of armed forces sent abroad as peace keepers, refugees who arrive in Sri Lanka from some other countries etc. It is important to obtain the vaccination against Malaria before leaving for affected countries, he added.

From Jada to Daddy
Daddy is one of Sri Lankas most well established and loved bands comprising of Viresh Cooray, Nimantha Kaluarachchi, Dila Hettiarachchi and Shamila Siriwardana. Interestingly it was known as Jada way back then. The original Jada cast did not feature Viresh but featured the rest of the crew and Sunil Pereras son Gayan Perera and his cousin.
Of course at that time Viresh and Gayan were good friends having studied together at APIIT. However interestingly enough Viresh was invited by the group to feature alongside them at a gig. Then Gayans cousin left and Viresh was asked to come and join the band. After that they started calling themselves Daddy and then the rest is history! However three years back Gayan left for studies abroad. The guys have played in school bands but have not played with other bands at a professional level. Dila has his own company Oareeses and the other guys pretty much have their own engagements.
Music is not my career, I am working, but my idea is to make it my career. For the time being I am working at a bank, like most of the other guys who do part time jobs, said Nimantha.
Viresh and Lahiru Perera who sings Rambari started Music Oven Institute.
Technical knowledge
I have a studio as well with Lahiru and then there is the band (Daddy). Music Oven is a studio. And then there is the music oven institute. At the Music Oven Institute they teach audio engineering. They have a qualification from the London examinations board, so they offer this qualification to students. There are not many schools for audio engineering these days. Viresh and Lahiru both studied Audio Engineering abroad and they decided to start teaching. There were not many people who had the technical knowledge of how to mix songs. Music Oven initially started out as a studio, it is a production house. Then we moved on to Music Oven Institute, said Viresh.
When it comes to Daddy, it has been 10 years since we released our first original. Jada was started in 2003. Then Daddy in 2006, stated Viresh. The group say that they do not really have a genre. It depends on whatever melody we make. We mainly focus on originals. If the melody is more towards rock, the production will be rock based, if it is more jazzy the production will be jazz based. It depends on whatever melody we get, pointed out Viresh.
When asked who comes up with the melodies, the group unanimously declared  All of us!. All four come up with their own melodies and they simply pick one  the best one and then they produce it.
Original songs
We have been here for a while and it has been about ten years, so when it comes to concerts we could have done a couple of hundreds. We have done two albums and in the recent past we have been focusing on singles. The first album was called Massina and the second album was called Arabiya. The two albums have around 12 songs each, so that makes it 24 songs and so altogether we have done 30 odd original songs, said Nimantha. The group say that they have been inspired by international bands such as Toto, Maroon 5, Earth Wind & Fire, Kool & the Gang, and new bands  Alter Bridge and Creed, Aerosmith and Cold Play.
Locally Rookantha Gunathilake has inspired me, I have listened to all his songs from my small days, and when it comes to International artists it would be David Foster, stated Nimantha.
Daddy has toured many countries such as Australia, India, Dubai and Oman. We had a crazy concert in Melbourne which was an awesome crowd!! And the venue was also special. The venue was where previously Boyz II Men and Kesha had played and even Enrique. It was the first time we had performed at a venue where international artists had performed. said Viresh.
The guys first toured abroad in 2006 in India. That was our first ever tour  December 31st night at the Taj Palace. We played for half an hour. It was the wedding of a very wealthy Diamond dealer.
The guys said that when they play live they have three more session musicians. They tour with us because just the four of us cant get the sound that we want when we play live. Even when bands like Maroon 5 perform they have additional musicians, to get the sound that they want, explained Viresh.
They are four diverse guys with different ideas and sometimes the ideas dont match so sometimes they depend on the majority vote.
We had a few sell out concerts, but we had this one particular concert where there were about 10  15 people, because the day before or the week before there was a murder in that location. We did not know that!!!, said Viresh.
The guys admit that the music industry in Sri Lanka is competitive.
Now the money has started flowing in. Back in the day there was not much money and it was hard to convince our parents that we wanted to do this. As parents they wanted us to go into something that would make us some money. But we believed we could make enough money and live a comfortable life. So we are heading there. We have pretty much got there. It is a competitive industry and it is a matter of becoming unique. For us it is going quite great. There are a lot of wealthy musicians living very comfortable lives. Even bands who just play for weddings they have a lot of money. These musicians make really good music and the fans love them. There are lots of people who come for our concerts, added Viresh.
The band confesses that in the future the plan is to go international.
We have some international arenas in mind that we want to play at. We want to make this a career. To do nothing else but go to the studio and record and play. We like the chemistry and we like how we work together.
The group are planning a Daddy 10th Anniversary Concert on July 29th. They will be having a series of concerts. We will be touring abroad as well. This will be two hours of full Daddy Concert. It is something that is completely us.
Viresh was quick to add that we have talent in Sri Lanka and we can compete with other countries musically. Right now where we lack is sound wise. The newer generation that has come out is completely outstanding. They are in a different league. Musically we can definitely compete. Where we lack right now is audio quality and technology. What we dont have is the equipment. We dont have investors for studio sound. Now we have investors for live sound. Businessmen who want to invest on studios, they dont have a way to recoup the money that they would potentially spend on a massive studio. Because of the lack of equipment we cant compete yet. Technology know how is there. But we are miles better from where we used to be five six years ago, elucidated Viresh.
The sky is the limit for these boys who practice really hard, they just keep raising the bar. Their combination is simply magical.

Japanese Experts Group suggests long and short term measures for garbage
The Japanese Expert Group which presented their report on the Meethotamulla garbage dump to President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday, proposed both short-term and long-term measures to overcome the problem. Head of the Experts Group Mitsutake Numahata explained to the President, as a short term measure, the garbage dump should be stabilized to ensure no further collapses. Before the onset of the monsoon, the shape of the dump should be streamlined and the base should be covered with polythene, he noted, according to the Presidents Media Unit. As a secondary measure, the Japanese experts suggested that the shape of the dump should be made symmetrical with a broad base to ensure proper the distribution of gravity.
The Experts Group had also proposed long-term measures to remove the dump by adopting 3-R system of reduce, reuse and recycle.
Head of the Experts Group Mitsutake Numahata handed over the report and made a power-point presentation to explain the recommendations of the group at the Presidents Official Residence in Colombo.
President Sirisena thanked the Japanese Experts Group for undertaking a comprehensive study within days of the disaster and said the Japanese expertise would be useful to solve the major issue of garbage in Sri Lanka.
He pointed out that although the Meethotamulla disaster began as a human tragedy, now garbage has become a political issue. He stressed on the need for a lasting solution to the issue and sought continued support from Japan for this endeavour.
Ministers Susil Premajayantha, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Patali Champika Ranawaka and Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma were also present.

Lady Gaga and Prince William team up
Lady Gaga and British royal Prince William have teamed up to encourage mental health sufferers to speak out about their issues.
The Born This Way singer was filmed having a FaceTime conversation with the Duke of Cambridge to discuss how she felt about being open about her struggles with mental health issues, including post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and how important it was to talk about it.
It made me very nervous at first, she said, speaking from the kitchen of her Los Angeles home. Theres a lot of shame attached to mental illness - you feel like somethings wrong with you. In my life I go, oh my goodness, look at all these beautiful, wonderful things that I have and I should be so happy but you cant help it if in the morning when you wake up you are so tired, you are so sad, you are so full of anxiety...
Prince William suggested other sufferers should be as open as the singer because it will help break the stigma attached to mental health and can make such a difference to each person, who could suffer more further down the line if they keep quiet.
Gaga agreed, saying, Even though it was hard, the best thing that could come out of my mental illness was to share it with other people and let our generation as well as other generations know that if you are feeling not well in your mind, that youre not alone... we have to make the strongest, most relentless attempt we can to normalise mental health issues so that people feel like they can come forward.
Prince William ended the conversation by asking her to visit his royal residence Kensington Palace when she visits London on tour later this year. He also thanked her for supporting the Heads Together campaign, which is also championed by his brother Harry and wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.

The National Transport Commission is a fully corrupted institution which should be probed by a Presidential Commission, the President of the Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) Gemunu Wijeratne alleged.
At a press conference on Sunday, Wijeratne said they are requesting President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a Presidential Commission to look into the corruptions taking place within the NTC.
Referring to the delay in issuing and re-tendering the Highway Route Permits, Wijeratne said despite a court order, the NTC is delaying the process. He also said about 800 have applied for the Permits this year.
During the previous regime, only five Highway route permits were properly issued in 2011. Now there are about 200 buses running on the Galle-Maharagama Highway with no proper legal permission to do so.
The permits issued in 2011 have to be re-tendered in 2016. It has not been done either by the NTC so far this year, Wijeratne said.
He pointed out that the government is undergoing a loss of about Rs.700 to1,000 million due to the NTC not issuing new Highway Route Permits.

Macron, Le Pen gird for final French election duel
FRANCE: Pro-European centrist Emmanuel Macron and anti-immigration leader Marine Le Pen began a final duel for the French Presidency Monday, after a first round of voting delivered a stunning blow to the traditional political class.
Macron is clear favourite to become Frances youngest president after topping Sundays ballot with 23.75 percent of votes, slightly ahead of National Front (FN) leader Le Pen on 21.53 percent, according to final results.
For months and again today Ive heard the doubts, the anger and the fears of the French people. Their desire for change too, 39-year-old Macron told thousands of flag-waving, cheering supporters in Paris on Sunday.
Polls suggest the ex-investment banker would beat Le Pen easily in the second round run-off on May 7, which will not feature a candidate from the traditional left or right for the first time in six decades. The outcome capped an extraordinary campaign in a deeply divided and demoralised France, which has been rocked by a series of terror attacks since 2015 and remains stuck with low economic growth.
Le Pen, who has hardened her anti-immigration and anti-Europe rhetoric over the past week, hailed a historic vote in front of her supporters, adding: The first stage has been passed.
The French vote was being closely watched as a bellwether for populist sentiment following the election of Donald Trump as US President and Britains vote to leave the EU.
Le Pen follows in the footsteps of her father Jean-Marie, who made it through to the 2002 presidential run-off in what came as a political earthquake for France. Le Pen Senior went on to suffer a stinging defeat when mainstream parties closed ranks to keep him out.
Though Le Pen came in behind Macron, there was joy at the FNs election party Sunday night in Henin-Beaumont, a former coal mining town in northern France, with outbursts of the Marseillaise national anthem.Macron also drew immediate support from his defeated rivals from the Socialists and Republicans.
Socialist Benoit Hamon, who won a humiliating 6.35 percent, said the left had suffered a historic drubbing but urged voters to keep out Le Pen who he said was an enemy of the republic.
Scandal-hit Republicans candidate Francois Fillon followed suit, saying: There is no other choice than voting against the far-right.
Fillon was seen as a favourite until January when his campaign was torpedoed by allegations that he gave his British-born wife a fictitious job as his parliamentary assistant.
He took 19.91 percent of Sundays vote. Support for Communist-backed Melenchon, meanwhile, had surged in recent weeks on the back of assured performances in two televised debates.
He got 19.64 percent of the vote, underlining the strength of anti-establishment sentiment.
The vote took place under heavy security after Thursdays killing of a policeman on Pariss Champs-Elysees avenue claimed by the Islamic State group.
With France still under the state of emergency imposed after the Paris attacks of November 2015, around 50,000 police and 7,000 soldiers were deployed to guard voters. .- AFP

Malinga preparing for ODI return after 2015
Sri Lankas match winning fast bowler Lasith Malinga is expected to return to One-Day International cricket after a lapse of two years after he was included in the squad of 15 for the ICC Champions Trophy in England in June.
Malingas last ODI for his country was against West Indies at Pallekele on November 7, 2015 and since then he has been battling a troubled knee that has restricted his appearances for his country only to T20 Internationals.
But since of late Malinga has expressed keenness to return to play fifty-over cricket especially in the ICC Champions trophy and Sri Lanka Cricket knowing the value of the player and what an important cog in the wheel he is for the team has worked with him assiduously towards getting him fit to bowl a full 10 overs in the fifty-over version of the game.
Dinesh Chandimal (left) in conversation with captain Angelo Mathews (extreme right) and Upul Tharanga who has been appointed the vice-captain.
Malinga is looking forward to playing in a 50-over match after two years. We took a medical assessment of Malingas fitness conditions. He has expressed that if he is selected he is willing to give his 100 percent to the team, said chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya. A cricketer like Malinga is an asset to any captain in the side with his experience.
Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala said that SLC had got Malinga medically cleared and that he was now fit to play 10 overs.
He was initially cleared medically to bowl a maximum of 4-5 overs which was too much of strain on him, but two weeks ago just before he left for the IPL he was declared fit to bowl 10 overs, said Sumathipala.
We are building him up for the 10-over game. Malinga playing in the IPL is to our advantage because he is with the top class cricketing environment and practicing. Right now we are getting reports that he is getting upto 8 overs and improving to 10 overs. We have to make sure that he is fit by about May 10 or so.
We are expecting the players to be back from the IPL on May 9 especially the captain (Angelo Mathews) and we are looking at Malinga to be available for our four warm-up games in England. Those games are very important for him to play and bowl 10 overs. His physical fitness is superb it is match fitness which he is lacking now.
He has to adapt himself he is such an important player we are looking to give him a match fitness test. He will travel to England with the team but if his match fitness is getting delayed we rather put him before high intensity training. What we want is for Malinga to play in the matches. According to the medical reports and evidence, we have to peak him slowly to play in the 10 overs. He is such an important player our plan is to leave him as he is. The captain wants him in the team and he himself is keen to play and win the Champions Ttrophy for the country. We are managing him and player management is what is taking place right now, he said.
POOR FORM SEES CHANDIMAL LOSE VICE-CAPTAINCY
Poor form and injury has resulted in Dinesh Chandimal losing the vice-captaincy to Upul Tharanga.
Soon after the last ICC World T20, Sri Lanka Cricket announced that Angelo Mathews and Chandimal would be the long-term captain and vice-captains respectively till the 2019 World Cup.
However for the Champions Trophy in England in June, the national selectors named Tharanga as vice-captain to Mathews who will lead the team.
Explaining the change SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala said, Policy wise we would like to see stability in the team. We are happy that Angelo is taking the responsibility and going through. First of all a player should have a place in the side. In the last few months or so Chandimal couldnt sustain his place in the team in all three formats. When Angelo got injured the vice-captain also had an injury. Even though our vision is to have a permanent captain and vice captain time and time again due to injuries and various constraints we have to change.
Right now the selectors are of the view in case Mathews is unable to play the best man to lead the team who is within the 15 is vice captain Upul Tharanga. Based on current form he is the best man who will have a place in the side. The vice captain should be able to fit into the 11 definitely. Thats fair thinking and its not to run down Dinesh Chandimal. We know how cricket goes there are outstanding players where we have to drop them but our intention is very clear. Chandiamal has got to perform in the team and make sure he has got a permanent place in the side. Policy wise we are still on board but the selectors are free to make recommendations based on current form and current strength of each and every player.

Merritt heads US dominance, De Grasse stars
NASSAU, sunday: American veteran Lashawn Merritt showed all his experience to bag a third successive 4x400m gold at the IAAF World Relays on Sunday, as Canadian Andre de Grasse underlined his credentials as Usain Bolts most likely successor.
The all-powerful US team followed up on victories on Saturday in the womens 4x800m and mens 4x100m relays by clinching gold in both the men and womens 4x400m and mens 4x800m to easily top the medals table.
Merritt, whose first senior relay gold dates back to the Helsinki worlds in 2005, had teammates David Verburg, Tony McQuay and Kyle Clemons to thank for putting him out in front.
But he hadnt counted on 18-year-old Botswanan sensation Karabo Sibando, who caught the 30-year-old American up before Merritt battled down the home stretch to hold on for a nerve-racking win in 3min 02.13sec from the Africans, Jamaica taking bronze.
We have a great group of guys here tonight, said Merritt. They did what they had to do and I did what I do best, thats bring it home, my third time here and third gold! - On the rise - Canadian De Grasse, who won three medals at last years Rio Olympics, underlined his coming of age as Jamaican legend Bolts own tip as world sprintings next dominant figure by laying down a startling third leg in the 4x200m relay.
It was enough to wrest back control for Canada, teammate Aaron Brown holding off American Ameer Webb for a scintillating victory in the 4x200m relay, Jamaica taking bronze.
Canadas victory, with Gavin Smellie and Brendon Rodney running the first two legs, was the first time a country other than the US or Jamaica had won a sprint relay and made up for the disappointment of not finishing the 4x100m.
It was a great run by all of us, said De Grasse, 22. We came together collectively, we just wanted to keep the stick around. We told ourselves to trust each other and be patient. Canadas win was followed by another upset as Germany picked up an unexpected gold in the womens 4x100m, Alexandra Burghardt, Lisa Mayer, Tatjana Pinto and Rebekka Haase combining to outpace Jamaica with their winning time of 42.84sec.
The US presence in the race came to an abrupt halt after first leg Tianna Bartoletta tumbled nastily to the floor before baton passover.
But otherwise, the US team shone, with self-proclaimed relay queen Natasha Hastings adding yet another gold to her trophy cabinet as she ran in the anchor leg in the 4x400m in the footprints of teammates Phyllis Francis, Ashley Spencer and Quanera Hayes for victory in 3min 24.36sec, Poland taking silver ahead of Jamaica.

Messi hits Barca 500 with last gasp El Clasico winner
Madrid, sunday: Lionel Messi struck his 500th Barcelona goal with almost the last kick of the game to blow the La Liga title race wide open with a thrilling 3-2 win at Real Madrid on Sunday.
Messi had broken a three-year goalless drought against Madrid to cancel out Casemiros opener for Madrid in the first-half.
Ivan Rakitics stunning strike and a red card for Madrid captain Sergio Ramos for chopping down Messi 13 minutes from time put Barca on course for victory before James Rodriguez came off the bench to level four minutes from time.
However, fittingly, Messi had the final say with a brilliant finish deep into stoppage time to lift Barcelonas hopes of a third straight La Liga title.
Victory takes Barca top of the table thanks to their better head-to-head record with both sides locked on 75 points, but Madrid have a game in hand.
He is the best player for me in history and I have seen a lot of football, said Barca boss Luis Enrique as he celebrated victory in his final Clasico in charge.
In modern football when everyone is tactically and physically better he still makes the difference.
The fact he has scored his 500th goal shows all of us as Barca fans are lucky to have him identified with the club.
However, Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane lamented his sides inability to see the game out with a man less at 2-2 that would have seen them remain very much in the driving seat for a first title in five years.
At 2-2 we should have used our heads more, said the Frenchman.
The way we are, we are always positive and think we can score the third goal, but then we are all out of position and you see what happened.
Fresh from dumping Bayern Munich out the Champions League in a 4-2 thriller after extra-time in midweek, Madrid had started confidently in another breathless encounter at the Bernabeu.
Cristiano Ronaldo had strong appeals for a penalty waived away inside two minutes after he appeared to have been clipped by Samuel Umtiti.
Shortly after Messi was left floored and bloodied after being caught by a stray elbow from Marcelo.
The Argentine was still down by Ronaldo drilled another fine effort towards goal that Marc-Andre ter Stegen did well to parry to safety. Unsurprisingly given both Madrids potency and Barcas inability to defend set-pieces, the opener arrived from a dead ball.
Marcelo picked up the loose ball from a corner and when Sergio Ramos volleyed his cross against the post, Casemiro was on hand to tap into an unguarded net.
The lead lasted just five minutes, though, as with a handkerchief still mopping the blood from his cheek, Messi danced past Dani Carvajal and Nacho to fire home his first goal against Madrid for three years.
Gareth Bales return from injury was a short-lived one as he was replaced by Marco Asensio before half-time.
However, Madrid were rampant at the start of the second period, but were met with a wall of resistence in Ter Stegen.
The German dived low to his left to turn international teammate Toni Krooss effort behind before diverting Karim Benzemas goalbound header to safety with his outstretched foot.
However, Keylor Navas was also busy at the other end as he came to Madrids rescue on three occasions.
Firstly, he got a foot to Paco Alcacers prodded effort before pulling off acrobatic saves to deny Gerard Pique and Luis Suarez.
Ronaldo then missed a guilt-edged chance to put Madrid back in front as he somehow turned the ball over from point-blank range after unselfish play from Asensio.
There was nothing Navas could do to deny Barca 17 minutes from time when Rakitic took aim from 25 yards and drilled into the top corner.
The match seemed to have swung decisively in Barcas favour four minutes later when Ramos scythed down Messi to be shown the 22nd red card of his career.
However, even with 10 men, Madrid rallied and levelled when substitute James Rodriguez swept home Marcelos cross four minutes from time.
There was still time for one huge twist in the title race, though, as Sergi Robertos lung-bursting run led a Barca counter-attack to feed Jordi Alba and his cross was smashed into the corner by Messi.

More on Cuts and Glances
This article was also written based on the book Australian Cricket Anecdotes by Gideon Haig, I hope the readers will bear with the strong words used at times which is typical of the Aussies.
THE ILLITERATE
Carrying on from last weeks article;
Left to do the fast bowling duties on his own, Dennis Lillee bowled at his best. In fifteen first class matches in 1976-77, he took 93 wickets. Against Pakistan he employed as stimulus the eccentric pronouncements of their manager Shuja-ud-din, who had branded the Australian players as illiterate.
Dennis was sufficiently put out to have a go at Shuja the next time they met----Shuja walked up and in his most pleasant tone enquired after Dennis health. There were quite a few people in the room at the time and I reckon that each one was holding his breath. So when Deniss reply came, it was all the more impressive because of the background of silence. Putting on his most vacant stare, Dennis emitted something that could only be described as a guttural grunt.
Looking somewhat bemused, the Colonel repeated his question. How are you Dennis alright At which Dennis repeated his grunt, only louder and deeper than before.
Obviously alarmed at this unexpected reaction, the Colonel hastily stepped back a pace and in a slightly more timid voice ventured to inquire if Dennis wasnt feeling well. How the hell should I know growled Dennis, put on his most intimidatory scowl. Im bloody illiterate arent I

ACCIDENTS IN ADELAIDE
Terry Jenner sustained an unusual injury when WA (Western Australia) met SA (South Australia) at the Adelaide Oval for their first Sheffield Shield match of the 1976-77 seasons: he pulled out of his delivery stride during a spell of 4-73, and wiped from his mouth the deposit just left there by a passing gull.
The players who were rolling on the ground in their mirth as T.J cleaned up, almost missed a rare moment of humility from their leggie. Quite appropriate I suppose, he said pointing to his mouth. There has been quite a lot of the same coming out over the years
The Wit of Cricket (Brayshaw) p30
THOMMO
Hall of Fame inductee Jeff Thomson had the Allan Border Medal crowd in stitches with a memorable speech.
Thomson started his speech with: I admire these guys who play now, theyve got to work their arses off and play so much cricket  I mean all the stuff theyve got to put up with, all the press all media and everything like that.
We flew under the radar. I played football in the off-season, I did that so I could get away from cricket we didnt have to do it 12 months of the year... we wonder why they all break down, why wouldnt they break down
In typical Thommo style, the 65-year-old had the crowd in tears with some ribald jokes that demand viewing of the speech in full to properly appreciate.
Thomson paid tribute to fellow inductee Grout  the pair hails from the same Brisbane club Toombul, albeit in different eras and roles.
Thomson then thanked his (presumably long-suffering) wife and children.
For me its all about the kids and my wife down there, all the sh*t shes had to put up with for 40 years, I mean she didnt get all the trips you girls get down here now, he quipped.
Mate, we had to sneak them in on planes, they used to stay in some sh*t hole down the road  Im serious now! The guys will tell you, all the blokes, no wonder half of them are divorced.
The reason youre here, what Im happy about is all the parents and my parents  my old man is dead but my mum is still alive, shes 97  thank Christ, sh*t I hope I dont last that long  not the way I drink.
Im going to run out of money very shortly, especially tonight.
Its all those people that help you as a kid, you know the ones that dont come in this room tonight, the ones that do all the sh*t when youre a kid taking you to the games.
Theyre never the recognized ones  but theyre the ones that ring you up and say well done, so yeah, its for those people.
So thank you.  Internet

No service extension for SriLankan Airlines Security Chief
The Public Enterprise Development Ministry will take steps as per recommendations of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry not to give a service extension to a Head of Security at SriLankan Airlines, Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim said yesterday.
The security chief in question is a retired Army Major General who was appointed by the previous government. He is on his third service extension, Airlines sources said.
The Commission has observed that the officer concerned has allegedly harassed and threatened SriLankan Airlines officers who had come before them to give evidence into alleged fraud and corruption that had taken place at SriLankan Airlines.
Minister Kabir Hashim said the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) had issued a letter to his ministry on Friday with recommendations to remove the Airlines Security Chief.
The letter was with my ministry secretary. Ive got it in my hands just today (yesterday), he said.
Accordingly, to go along with the Commissions recommendation, the Public Enterprise Development Ministry Secretary has referred it for action from the board of directors of SriLankan Airlines.
The Airlines had yet to report it back to the Ministry, he said.

North Korea tensions: US submarine arrives in South Korea

A US submarine has arrived in South Korea, amid worries of another North Korean missile or nuclear test.
The missile-armed USS Michigan is set to join an incoming group of warships led by aircraft carrier Carl Vinson.
North Korea is celebrating its army's 85th founding anniversary on Tuesday. It marked the event with a large-scale firing drill, South Korea said.
Tensions have risen in the area in recent weeks, with the US and North Korea exchanging heated rhetoric.
Experts fear Pyongyang could be planning more tests - it has marked some key anniversaries in the past with nuclear tests or missile launches.
However, South Korea's defence ministry said "no unusual development had been detected".
Instead, the North conducted a large live-fire drill around the city of Wonsan, South Korea said.
"Our military is closely monitoring the North Korean military's movement," the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
North Korea conducted a failed ballistic missile test on 16 April, prompting US Vice-President Mike Pence to warn it not to "test" President Donald Trump.
In an unusual move, the entire US Senate has been asked to attend abriefing on North Koreaon Wednesday at the White House.
The USS Michigan docked at South Korea's Busan port on Tuesday, in what it called a routine visit. It is a nuclear-powered submarine carrying 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 60 special operations troops and mini-subs, reported theSouth Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo.
The North Korean crisis is moving on many fronts.
The US submarine docking in South Korea is a routine event - but in this time of heightened tension it has extra significance
Pyongyang remains defiant, including of China, warning that if it helped the US, the results would be "catastrophic".
Envoys from South Korea, the US and Japan are discussing North Korea in Tokyo.
What this all adds up to depends on whether President Trump has rejected the advice given to his predecessors that attacking North Korea could provoke an attack on Seoul, with one expert saying there could be tens of thousands of deaths on the first day.
It may be that President Trump has decided that the cost of North Korea eventually getting nuclear weapons that could strike the US means that the risk of war has to be taken. We simply do not know.
The submarine is expected to take part in military exercises with the Carl Vinson warship group, which the US said it was dispatching to North Korea earlier this month to "maintain readiness" in the region.
At the time, Trump said that he was sending an "armada" to the region and that the US had submarines which were "very powerful, far more powerful than the aircraft carrier".
Pyongyang reacted angrily to the aircraft carrier deployment, threatening to sink it and launch a "super-mighty pre-emptive strike" against what it called US aggression.
However, the US warships caused some confusion and attracted mockery when it emerged that they actuallysailed in the opposite direction, away from North Korea, after the announcement. However, US Navy officials said they are now proceeding to the region as ordered.
China is North Korea's only ally and main trading partner - and the US has been urging Beijing to help put pressure on Pyongyang.
Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke to Trump on Monday, urging all sides to "maintain restraint and avoid actions that would increase tensions".

The one not chosen
The right of every man to life is correlative with the duty to preserve it; his right to a decent standard of living with the duty of living it becomingly, so writes Pope John the XXIII in his Encyclical Pacem in Terris.
Simply put, this means that just as we must preserve and defend the right to life of every human being, society must also provide the supports necessary for that being to live in dignity.
The Catholic Church in Sri Lanka is vehemently opposed to the proposed legislation to decriminalize abortion. Indeed, the taking of life, at whatever stage is a crime and does not find favour with most people. Here, the Invitro Fertilization method deserves mention, as in some instances, unused, live embryos too are discarded. As Catholics, we believe and support the sanctity of life from conception to natural death. To us, this means upholding the right to life of everyone including the babe in the womb. Therefore, is opposition to the taking of life in the womb enough What must we do to ensure a life of dignity for the mother and child
Listed as a crime under the Penal Code, a woman can be charged for terminating a pregnancy whether or not the woman is married. More often than not, it is economic hardship or social stigma that drives a woman to seek a termination of a pregnancy.
While society sees abortion as a crime it fails to recognize that our attitudes towards women, fatherless children, the disabled and the poor, often create situations in which an abortion is considered the preferred option. It is our own complicity in creating and sustaining a culture of judgement and surveillance that aids and abets that sin.
Dignity and sanctity of life
The government of Sri Lanka proposes to decriminalize abortion under three circumstances; in the case of rape or incest, where the girl is under 16-years-old (constituting statutory rape) and serious foetal impairment.
Christian teaching tells us to accept whatever God gives, and even a seriously impaired foetus, cannot be aborted as it amounts to taking a life.
The same applies to a pregnancy that has occurred owing to rape, incest or where the girl is underage. In all of these circumstances, the only exception that allows a termination is if medical advice indicates that the mothers life is in grave danger. What this article aims to raise is that alongside the protection of life in the womb, we must also look to the dignity and sanctity of life at all stages.
As such, it is imperative that society be educated to be kind and respectful of children born in situations of rape, incest, outside marriage or with disabilities. In arguing for the right to life, we are called to support the mother and protect the child. In bringing to term the life of an abnormal or impaired foetus, parents must receive the necessary tools and supports to meet the economic and emotional demands of caring for such a child. Woefully, neither the government nor non-governmental agencies provide adequate supports for such children or their families. Nor is our education system geared to meet the special needs of these children.
Sri Lankan society is conditioned to automatically judge a woman who is pregnant outside the conventions of marriage. The tag unwed mother immediately places her in a position of disadvantage; to be pitied or scorned, to live a life of shame. We kill her at that point, as we kill the child she bears, at the very moment of birth by our attitude. That is the irony, that while we do all we can to prevent an abortion (because it is a sin to kill), we take away their dignity and their right to a decent standard of living with the duty of living it becomingly. This calls our attention to the justice question; to examine factors such as poverty and the stigma of being impure or fatherless, that lead women to choose abortion.
Catholics who opt for abortions and those who help carry out the act are excommunicated as per the teachings of the church. A statement released by the Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka on the issue, reiterates this clause, formal co-operation in an abortion constitutes a grave offence. The church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life.
Yet, the man who commits the heinous crime of rape gets off with a much lighter sentence. Lets take the case of the girl in Brazil, who, after being sexually abused by her step-father was found to be pregnant with twins at the tender age of 9. Her mother and doctors, all Catholics opted to terminate the pregnancy and were excommunicated. The Church in Brazil took the stand that though the step-father had committed a heinous crime, the abortion, the elimination of an innocent life, was more serious.  (Brazil rocked by abortion for 9-year-old rape victim, Independent)
It did not matter that the girl had been sexually abused for several years, or that she would live with the trauma of these events for the rest of her life. It did not matter that her life was in danger; her mother was expected to put her daughter through the rigours of pregnancy and possible death to save the life of the twins. (Given the circumstances and public outcry, The National Conference of Bishops of Brazil, later cancelled the excommunication order).
Evils of abortion
The Catholic Church in Sri Lanka is urging her clergy to organise prayer campaigns, and preach to the faithful on the evils of abortion, so as not to fool our womenfolk who thus call for the right to choice in regulating their babies to suit their so called newly won freedoms. (Koinonia Bulletin, February 2017) It is our view, that while we work to defend the unborn babe, that the Catholic Church must simultaneously spearhead a campaign to educate their menfolk to respect women and not treat them as sexual objects. The language used in the statement itself is patriarchal. It is imperative that we call our menfolk, and our society to integrity. Sanctity and dignity of life must also extend to the women who are sexually abused, shamed, and silenced by patriarchal attitudes.
The Church is well positioned to raise awareness through educational activities to change societys attitude to women who find themselves pregnant outside marriage, whatever the circumstance. Society must learn to respect children born in such situations instead of relegating them to live as orphans or quietly smuggled away from the mother or condemned to live within the confines of ones home, in the case of the disabled and impaired. It is important for that child to feel wanted..: writes Pope Francis in Amoris Laetitia, who in November 2016, while reiterating his opposition to abortion, which he refers to as a grave sin, also permitted Priests to forgive that sin, there is no sin that Gods mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the Father. Pope Francis Extends Priests Ability to Forgive Abortion, New York Times, Nov. 21, 2016
The Church could also do more in providing much needed support for care givers of the differently abled children in our midst. Such facilities would help dissuade parents from resorting to terminating an abnormal or impaired foetus.
The Catholic Church accrues her wealth through the generosity of her congregation. Such monies must be utilized to provide long-term activities and facilities that would ensure a life of dignity for all, instead of endorsing patriarchal attitudes through statements such as fool our womenfolk.
The church must also take the lead in alleviating poverty by insisting on a just wage for all workers[AR1], and supporting or initiating more income generating projects for the marginalized of society. The church must oppose schemes that jeopardize employment of the people for the financial gain of a few. The Maintenance Act of Sri Lanka has provision for the upkeep of children, adult offspring, disabled offspring and spouses unable to maintain themselves. Unfortunately, most women are either unaware of its provisions, or do not have the backing of family or community to fully benefit from it.
Therefore, it is our firm belief, that to successfully prevent abortions, there must be an attitudinal change in society. Who else is better positioned to bring about that change than our clergy
Pope Francis advises that, If the Church stays indoors, she certainly will age. The Church is called to come out of herself and to go to the existential peripheries, where the mystery of sin, pain, injustice, religious indifference and all of human miseries are found. (A Year with Pope Francis, Daily reflections from his writings, edited by Alberto Rossa, CMF)
The bishops, the clergy and the religious must take on a pivotal role along with the faithful to introduce a solution that would abide by the churchs teachings of protecting the unborn while ensuring the dignity of the mother and the child. The laity are not exempt from this call either. Discipleship calls them to take up this work, for the fast that is chosen is to loosen the chains of injustice, and to break the yoke. (Isaiah 58:6)
The call of the hour is immediate unified action.
We are certain that there are many Christians and non-Christians alike, who believe a change of attitude is essential if we are to safeguard the dignity of women and children, and uphold the right to life. We invite them all to join us in working together, along with the Church and the government in achieving this change.

An Overjoyed Builders Association..!
The world president of the International Builders Association smiled as he received a standing ovation from his members as soon as he entered the hall and walked up to the podium. The clapping and applause continued and as he looked at the happy members, he reflected how different it had been a year ago, when hed nearly been thrown out of the board for his failed policies and how the association had almost shut down.
A year ago, most of the builders had been facing bankruptcy and somehow they had blamed him for their dismal state of affairs.
How things had changed!
He continued walking up to make his speech and the cheering went on unabated. He allowed it to go on for a while, then raised his hands asking for quiet. Dear Members, thank you!
The applause was deafening, but died down as he continued, A year ago, we were a dejected lot. Today things have changed. There is construction everywhere, and there is money in your bank accounts!
More money then we ever imagined! shouted a builder, with a telltale paunch who a year ago, had been lean and skinny. And all thanks to you!
The President put up his hand before the applause could start again, and said, Well I would like to thank our world leaders who listened to me! Though I must tell you, it did not take much convincing to make them see my point of view! All I did was advice them to..
Build walls! shouted the hall in crescendo. Build walls! Build walls! Build walls! they all shouted.
And they have started! beamed the president. You dear members are making money, not building high-rises, skyscrapers and towers but miles and miles of walls. Walls around countries shutting themselves off from their neighbours, walls around communities, walls around races, walls around everything you could possibly think off!
Build walls! Build walls! Build walls! shouted the members in unison.
We have to be thankful of course to President Trump, a former member of our association, who kick-started the idea in his country and now has created walls between the white collared and blue collared, the whites and the blacks and browns, and huge, thick walls between religious communities. Being a builder himself it was not too difficult selling him the idea, and other countries seeing him going on to his building spree followed suit with glee!
The members rose again to clap and cheer and the president allowed himself a moment to bask in the glory of achievement. We knew England would follow immediately with the Brixit Wall, but many of us are surprised with developing countries like India, so quickly becoming master builders of masonry, brick and mortar!
The applause continued, and the president of the International Builders Association smiled as he went back to his honoured place to sit, he knew there was enough walls to build to keep him president for life..!

Pathfinder Foundation to conduct conference  on enhancing Indo-Lanka connectivity
The Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives of the Pathfinder Foundation, Carnegie India together with Vivekananda International Foundation (India) will conduct a conference on April 28, 2017 in Colombo.
Leading academics, professionals, subject matter experts and scholars from both the countries will discuss six major areas of concept of connectivity.
This conference will focus on three broad themes; past connectivity and the sources of decay; identifying the current possibilities; assessing the enduring obstacles and exploring ways to overcome them. At the second stage of the project, specific sectors could be taken up for more detailed examination.
The six major sectors will be cover with this conference included coastal shipping in the Bay of Bengal framework, multi modal surface and air links between Sri Lanka and Peninsular India, developing and promoting religious tourism, power grid connectivity and finally energy security through the strategic storage of hydrocarbons; resilient international telecom connectivity in the context of UN ESCAPs vision of an Asia Pacific Information Superhighway.
The main outcome from the workshop could be a report to be circulated among the policy makers in both capitals and interested stakeholders in regional and global institutions.
Enhancing connectivity, which has been a subject of discussion in the SAARC and BIMSTEC context, has also been a major national priority for both India and Sri Lanka. Promoting internal, trans-border and regional connectivity have become an urgent imperative for both nations, as they seek to sustain their rapid economic growth into the coming decades. Both Delhi and Colombo have rediscovered their geographic advantages and are determined to leverage these. India is now acutely conscious of its geo-economics location at the cross-roads of Asia and the heart of the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka has begun to emphasize its Indian Ocean identity and wants to leverage its position as the maritime fulcrum of the trade routes in the Indo-Pacific littoral. While past policies of self-reliance and the dynamic of local conflict devalued connectivity between the two nations, two and a half decades of economic liberalization have compelled Delhi and Colombo to focus on privileging their physical proximity. Trade volumes have rapidly grown in recent years, and so have mutual investments. The growing infrastructure linkages between the two countries are reflected in the fact that Colombo has become the second largest port (after Mumbai) for the movement of goods in and out of India.
Delhi and Colombo have signaled the political will to build on this interdependence and deepen connectivity between the two nations. But a host of problems have limited the progress.
These include political, economic, financial and institutional issues as well as entrenched popular apprehensions. Any effort to promote connectivity between the two countries must be understood by the ease of movement across the frontiers in the past and its deterioration in the second half of the 20th century due to the armed conflict and changing political dynamics.

Perrys culturally insensitive Instagram post
Katy Perry has reportedly angered some of her Indian fans by uploading an image of the Hindu goddess Kali with a disrespectful caption.
The Firework singer shared a picture which showed Kali, the Hindu goddess of time, creation, and destruction, with her tongue out and stepping on the chest of her male counterpart Shiva on April 19 and wrote in the caption, current mood.
Just one day later, it had attracted more than 12,000 comments, most of which came from angry Indians. Although some hit out at the musician, others tried to explain the images significance in Hindu religious iconography in the hope she would remove the image and apologise.
A user posting under the name sajrita.abbie wrote, The female Godess (sic) is Mata (mother) Kali and the male God is Lord Shiva and according to the mythology Mata Kali was very angry and she was destroying whatever came in her way so Lord Shiva was worried if she continued like this the world would come to an end. Therefore to stop her he lied down on the ground and when she put her leg on his chest.
After explaining that the goddess was in pain having disrespected Shiva, the user added, So how should I put in words that you understand the real meaning behind this picture. Well you are free to do whatever you like but as we all love and respect you I request you maam to please understand your Indians fans sentiments are getting disrespected and take this picture down.
Others were less understanding, with much of the outrage focusing on her caption and her taking the image, which is commonly used on calendars in India, out of context.
Despite fan pressure, the picture still remains on Katys Instagram page.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes visit to India will focus on the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), UNP MP Nalin Bandara said.
He made this observation while insisting that Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm Agreement was not on the cards of the Premiers visit to India.
He however said critical political and economic decisions would be made during the Premiers visit to India and Indian Premier Narendra Modis visit to Sri Lanka.
The UNP backbencher also said the Hambantota Port Agreement would be signed within the next two weeks.
He noted 90 percent of the Agreement has been finalized, adding that last minute negotiations were to reduce the 99-year lease period.
He pointed out the Ceylon Petroleum workers strike was triggered by misinformation campaign that the Trincomalee oil tanks would be sold to India.
Refuting this claim, the MP said the Governments intention was to develop the oil tanks, which were idling for many years, in a manner that benefits the country.
Responding to a question on the Cabinet reshuffle, the MP said they were against making changes to cabinet portfolios just because of personal rifts between the SLFP and UNP ministers.
However, he said they have no objection for a Cabinet reshuffle done in a scientific manner.

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has requested President Maithripala Sirisena to take action against politically driven trade unions which interrupt peoples supplies, and deploy armed forces to carry out services, Health Ministry sources said.
Minister Dr. Senaratne requested the President to deploy armed forces to supply fuel. The minister said trade unions should not put 21 million people in difficulties through trade union actions.
It is good if oil tans in Trincomalee can generate an income. It is the same at the Hambantota harbour. They should generate an income. Trade unions cannot be allowed to rule the country, the minister said.
Some trade unions use oil tanks to topple the government. Sections which cannot come into power through elections try to use other methods to topple the government. It was the former President who expressed the willingness to hand over oil tanks to India, he said.

Sharapovas return divides rivals
Stuttgart: Maria Sharapova returns to tennis this week following her 15-month ban having tested positive for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open.
The organisers of Stuttgarts WTA tournament sparked controversy by giving her a wildcard to play on Wednesday -- the first day she is eligible to play again -- which has divided tennis. Here is what the games top names have to say:
THOSE AGAINST
Carolina Wozniacki (DEN) - I think its very questionable, allowing, no matter who it is, a player that is still banned to play a tournament that week. From the tournament side, its disrespectful to the other players and the WTA. But it is what it is. Obviously rules are twisted and turned in favour of who wants to do what.
Agnieszka Radwanska (POL) - This kind of entry into the tournament should apply to players who dropped in the ranking because of injury, illness or some other random event. Not for those suspended for doping. Maria should recover some other way, starting with smaller events.
Angelique Kerber (GER) - Its a German tournament, and we (have) so many good German players, so this is also a little bit strange. Its also strange for the players, that she can walk on site on Wednesday and she can play on Wednesday.
Andy Murray (GBR) - I think you should really have to work your way back.The majority of tournaments are going to do what they think is best for their event. If they think having big names there is going to sell more seats, then theyre going to do that.
Dominika Cibulkova (SVK) - Its not about her, but everyone who was doping should start from zero.
THOSE FOR
Victoria Azarenka (BLR) - I think its good for tennis. She has such a huge fanbase and obviously thats going to bring more attraction to see how she will do, so I think its good for tennis, good entertainment.
Svetlana Kuznetsova (RUS) - If we talk about cheaters, people who cheat, you would say: Why would cheaters get a wild card, but then if there is some mistake, you know, its a little bit of a different story.
Venus Williams (USA) - The bodies have made their decision, and she has an opportunity to come back and continue her career. I think she should be allowed to continue that. If people want to give her wildcards, I guess thats the tournaments decision. It will be nice to have her back in the game. AFP

Sir Elton suffered 'potentially deadly' infection on tour

Sir Elton John suffered a "potentially deadly" bacterial infection during a tour, forcing him to spend two nights in intensive care and cancel concerts in the US, his management says.
The singer became violently ill at the end of a tour of South America last week, requiring him to return to the UK for urgent treatment.
Nine concerts that were due to be staged in Las Vegas and California over the next two weeks have been cancelled.
Sir Elton is now resting at home.
A statement by his management said infections of the kind suffered by the star were "rare and potentially deadly". It gave no other details.
"Thankfully, Elton's medical team identified this quickly and treated it successfully. He is expected to make a full and complete recovery," it added.
Sir Eltonis due to resume his schedule of live performances in the UK on 3 June.
"I am so fortunate to have the most incredible and loyal fans and apologise for disappointing them. I am extremely grateful to the medical team for their excellence in looking after me so well," the star said.
His Million Dollar Piano tour is due to end its run in May 2018.
It is not the first time Sir Elton has battled a serious bout of ill-health.
Appendicitis operation
While performing his show The Million Dollar Piano at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada in May 2012, Sir Elton became ill with a serious respiratory infection. Following his doctor's recommendation, he cancelled the show's last four concerts.
In July 2013, he had to cancel a concert in London's Hyde Park when he was diagnosed with appendicitis, which required urgent surgery.
"I knew I was sick but I didn't know I had such a dangerous thing inside of me until I had a scan, which was after nine shows, 24 flights and a summer ball. I could have easily died," he later saidin an interview with The Telegraph.
Various organisations have tweeted get well messages to Sir Elton, includingAmerican Idol, This Morning andBPI Music, which wrote: "Dear Sir @eltonofficial we're sorry to hear you've been unwell butso happy you are on the mend, and we wish you a full & speedy recovery."
The career of Sir Elton spans five decades and has been littered with accolades, hit singles and world records.
The 70-year-old singer has sold more than 200 million records, making him one of the most successful artists of all time.

A total of 37 foreign delegates and 2 local parties, representing various international submarine cable maintenance authorities as well as facility providers such as cable ships and submarine cable spare storage depots attended the meeting SLT has been a partner of the cable maintenance consortium since the early 80s, investing in SEA-ME-WE and two other submarine cable systems. The privilege of hosting the consortiums was awarded to Sri Lanka and SLT due to the proposed submarine cable depot in Galle to facilitate the cable maintenance activities in the region.
SLT has taken the initiative to establish a joint venture company with Indian Ocean Cable Ship Pte Ltd of Singapore to set up a cable depot in Galle.

Once the cable depot is established, the Cable ship Asia Restorer will also be stationed in Galle.With the new cable depot in Galle, availability of international communication facilities will be enhanced since it helps to attend the submarine cable repair and maintenance workin the region without any delay.
It is a tremendous honour for Sri Lanka Telecom to be a part of such a strategic and vital project. It will soon be our responsibility to deliver services via the depot to the international cable systems that connect Asia and Europe, said Priyantha Fernandez the Chief Network Officer of Sri Lanka Telecom.

The move will protect and give value to the intellectual property rights associated with Traditional Knowledge (TK), and Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs) unique to Sri Lanka.
We can make significant progress in months to come that would see the final stage of the national policy. Overall IP policy is currently being developed for Sri Lanka in consultation with the relevant stakeholders. The drafters of the overall IP policy will soon undertake a visit to the Republic of Korea to study best practices in this regard, he said.
The Minister also emphasised that the respective members should ensure to assess the progress made and to further optimize the 10 Point Action Plan of WIPO-Sri Lanka Cooperation launched following the visit of Dr. Gurry.
This 10 Point Action Plan was developed with the objective of upgrading the IP regime in Sri Lanka and to enable it to move beyond the traditional domains of copyright and patents into new areas including innovation and branding and to bring it in line with international standards.
I am pleased to note that during the past three and a half years with the support of WIPO Sri Lanka has been able to reap significant tangible benefits under the 10 Point Action Plan. Under the third aspect of 10 Point Action Plan, IP Hubs have been set up to accelerate innovation and commercialization of IP in Sri Lanka.

The progress in the fifth aspect is the continued technical assistance and capacity building from WIPO received to strengthen Sri Lankas National Intellectual Property Office (NIPO). The next achievement was acceding to the Marrakesh Treaty to facilitate access to published works for persons who are blind visually impaired or otherwise print disabled.
Sri Lanka became the 24th country to accede to this treaty in October 2016. The seventh aspect is Sri Lanka receiving support from the WIPO to complete accession to the Madrid Protocol by end of 2017 or early 2018.
The next point of progress is Sri Lankas participation for the first time as a pilot country in a WIPO Project on Intellectual Property Tourism and Culture coordinated at the country level by Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) to promote awareness on the role of IP in the tourism-related economic activities of the country, the minister said.
This has been ongoing since May last year. The ninth point of progress is taking steps to incorporate amendments to the National IP law to facilitate registration of Geographical Indications in Sri Lanka and to safeguard production and export of Ceylon Tea and Ceylon Cinnamon as well as to increase the value and competitive advantage of other Sri Lankan priority products.
According to the Minister, the progress in the tenth point is the successful conclusion of many training sessions to advance capacity building and raise awareness in Collective Management of Rights and Copyrights and to build respect for IP and effective enforcement of IP rights.

Sri Lanka take their chances sans an off-spinner
The absence of a specialist off-spinner in the Sri Lanka squad of 15 named for the ICC Champions Trophy in England in June stood out like a sore thumb, but Sri Lanka Cricket and the national selection committee headed by Sanath Jayasuriya were confident that the two spinners they have named were good enough to deliver the goods.
Lakshan Sandakan who bowls left-arm chinaman and Seekkuge Prasanna, right-arm leg-spin were the two specialist spinners who find a place in the squad that comprises eight batsmen and five fast-medium bowlers.
We think the leg-spinner (Prasanna) and Sandakan can give a lot of variety to the team so the off-spin responsibility has been entrusted to Asela Gunaratne, said selection committee chairman Jayasuriya.
Asela has done so in the past and we have a lot of confidence on him as an off-spinner. It depends on the strength of the opposition teams how many left-handers they have in their line-up. The variety of Sandakan gives a lot of opportunity to take more wickets. Its what you need in a 50-over match. Between the 20th and 40th overs you need to take wickets. So it will be a clever bowler who can take wickets. This is the best line up and I think the spinners can do the needful for Sri Lanka, he said.
It was only in the recent home series against Bangladesh; Sri Lanka saved their skin by including an off spinner rather late in the Tests, ODIs and T20Is and managed to draw the three series. However in England the thinking is that unlike the subcontinent wickets an off-spinners workload would not be as great.
South Africa has three left-handers (Quinton de Kock, JP Duminy and David Miller), India 2 (Sikhar Dhawan and Yuvraj Singh). We have found that Pakistan wherever we have played them they struggle against leg-spinners and left-arm spinners, said skipper Angelo Mathews who has regained the Sri Lanka captaincy following a hamstring injury that kept him out of the Bangladesh series.
Sandakan also spins the ball away from the left hander and if we had included an off-spinner we will not be able to take a leg-spinner because we can select a squad of only 15. It is with that thinking that we have picked Prasanna. We took the chance not to select a specialist off-spinner because Sandakan can take the ball away from the left-hander and we also have Asela who can bowl off-spin, Mathews said.
Sri Lanka has picked eight specialist batsmen namely Upul Tharanga who is vice-captain to Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella, Kusal Perera, Kusal Mendis, Chamara Kapugedera, Asela Gunaratne and Dinesh Chandimal. The five specialist fast bowlers are Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulasekara, Suranga Lakmal, Nuwan Pradeep and Thisara Perera.
After much discussion we picked the final squad. It is the longest selection committee meeting Ive had since I became chairman of selectors, said Jayasuriya.
Weve always looked at picking the best squad to represent the country. We took the views of all the coaches attached to the team along with the captain and picked the side. Mathews and Tharanga have a lot of responsibility on their shoulders as they carry the hopes of 20 million people in the country.
As chairman of selectors I think this team will be able to win the Champions trophy and bring it back to Sri Lanka. It is the wish of everyone from the Sri Lanka Cricket president downwards, he said.
Speaking on the same lines Mathews stated, This is the best team that you can pick from Sri Lanka which the selection committee has given me. The 2-3 weeks of preparations arranged by Sri Lanka Cricket is going to be very important to us ahead of the tournament. We have 12 days in England and practicing and training in those conditions is going to be very vital for our squad. I have a lot of confidence with the squad given to me. If we perform well we have another opportunity of winning another ICC trophy and bringing it back to Sri Lanka.
Apart from the main squad of 15, SLC are also arranging for an additional two players  off-spinner Dilruwan Perera and batsman Danushka Gunathilaka who can also bowl off-breaks to accompany the team to England as standbys on tour. These two players can be included in the squad only if there is an injury to any of the players in the main squad. They are being sent along with the main squad to be acclimatized to the conditions and wickets just in case their services are required.
The role of wicket-keeper and openers Jayasuriya said will be decided by the team management after the four practice matches that Sri Lanka will play ahead of the Champions Trophy.
We have Kusal Perera, Dinesh Chandimal and Niroshan Dickwella, we hope to have Kusal keeping wickets. We will take a final decision on who will keep in England. Going early to England is the best opportunity we have got to prepare for the tournament. We can find a solution to all the question marks we have for instance like the wicket-keeper, said Jayasuriya.
We have given the opportunity to the captain, vice-captain and the supporting staff to pick the best 11. If we have three wicket-keepers who are equally good, its good for the country. It is not necessary that we name a wicket-keeper ahead of the tournament because we have the choice of picking any of the three, he said.
The openers berth will be fought out by Tharanga, Kusal Perera and Dickwella.
Apart from the two warm-up games arranged by the ICC against Australia at the Oval (May 26) and against New Zealand at Edgbaston (May 30), SLC has managed to include two practice games against Scotland n May 21 and May 23 at Kent where the team will be training.
Prior to departing to England, the selected squad will undergo specialist training and capacity building in Colombo from May 2-8, intensity, altitude and match conditioning in Kandy from May 9-14 which will include a practice match on May 11 and pre-tour preparations and logistics in Colombo on May 15 and 16 before they depart for England on May 18.

Sri Lankan housemaid arrested in Dubai
A housemaid landed in court seven years after she had stolen Dh200,000 worth of valuables from her former sponsor who had cancelled her residency and made her leave Dubai in 2010.
The Emirati female sponsor had accompanied her sick mother on a medical trip abroad in June 2010 and during that time, the 35-year-old Sri Lankan maid was believed to have stolen the valuables.
When the sponsor was abroad, she received a call from her sister, who informed her, according to records, that she had received telephone bills for calls made to Sri Lanka.
The two sisters agreed not to create any problems for the suspected maid and decided to cancel her visa and labour contract and sent her back home in August 2010. Records said the sponsor later lodged a police complaint, in which she alleged that the 35-year-old maid had stolen valuables worth around Dh200,000 from her residence.
Believed to have been apprehended at the Dubai International Airport when she returned to the UAE, the Sri Lankan maid was accused of theft.
According to the charges sheet, prosecutors said the suspect stole several gold items, diamonds, pieces of valuable jewellery and wristwatches.The suspect pleaded not guilty and refuted the theft accusation when she defended herself before the Dubai Court of First Instance on Thursday.
The sponsor told prosecutors: My sister had lost her mobile phone  when I was abroad with my mother. She told me over the phone that she had received bill for the phone calls that she did not make to Sri Lanka.
I told her not to discuss the issue with the suspect. We returned to the UAE in August and cancelled the suspects visa because we did not want her to keep her with us any more as she may steal more things.
After she left the country, we found in the kitchen some receipts showing that the suspect had sold some gold and jewellery items and sent some stuff to Sri Lanka. On checking our belongings, we found a large number of valuable items missing  then I reported the matter to the police.A ruling in the case will be announced on April 27. - Gulf News

Trinco oil tank farm a joint venture with India
The government will sign an agreement with India to form a joint venture company to operate and manage oil storage tanks in Trincomalee , Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim said yesterday.
The minister said that does not mean that we are giving away of any of countrys ports to India or any other country.
Addressing a press Conference he also said we are not going to assign full control of the totality of our oil tanks in Trincomalee to IOC (India Oil ompany),
He said, the claims and speculations that have spread all around that all of our false.
The strike action staged by petroleum trade unionists has been a result of misrepresentation made by interested parties, Hashim pointed out.
He said discussions were currently under way to dispel any misconception regarding the matter
Asked how those oil tanks would be shared, the minister said, he cannot give an official statement on the matter as he is not the minister in charge of the subject but said ,  as per earlier agreement the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation did not own a single oil tank. But as it stood after that discussion the Corporation is to get ten oil tanks. IOC was going to get 14 tanks.
The rest, I think about 74 tanks are going to be shared between the governments of Sri Lanka and India following signing an agreement between the two countries, to form a joint venture company, he explained.
This is not going to bring any adverse effects as is being speculated by some sections, he added.

Having successfully enhanced the vision of hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans for quarter century, Vision Care will celebrate its 25 year anniversary, by officially launching Nethralokana Sathkara, a pioneering initiative to distribute 25,000 spectacles among deserving people from different parts of Sri Lanka at no cost.
Starting next week, Nethralokana Sathkara will be rolled out in six major cities of the country: Galle, Kandy, Kurunegala, Jaffna, Anuradhapura and Colombo. In parallel to the programmes in the regional cities, the company's branches that are situated around these six main cities will also roll out programmes of their own, strengthening the project's island-wide reach and distribution.
Expressing his views about their significant initiative, Vision Care Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, Dasantha Fonseka said, Launching Nethralokana Sathkara on the outset of our 25th anniversary is quite momentous for us all at Vision Care.
We have been pioneers in introducing quality and affordable eye care solutions as well as state-of-the-art optometry technologies at our island-wide branches, helping enhance the vision of thousands of Sri Lankans over the years. With Nethralokana Sathkara, we wanted to mark this occasion by reaching out to deserving people in the country, and help empower their lives through what we do best, enhance vision.
The initial phase of Nethralokana Sathkara will be the calling of applications, which will commence from 24th April to 9th May for residents in the Galle and Kandy areas. Jaffna and Kurunegala applications are scheduled from 8th May to 23rd May, while Anuradhapura and Colombo applications will be called out from 22nd May till 6th June.
This will be followed by a comprehensive Eye Test for the chosen applicants from mid-May onwards. Based on the tests conducted by qualified optometrists of Vision Care, a reading or a prescribed spectacle will be given to the applicant at the final distribution of spectacles, which is scheduled for June onward.
This programme also acts as a reminder to our purpose as an organization every single day, which is: to give Sri Lankans the best possible vision, enabling them to see the world and improve their lives through quality products and services. By eventually reaching out to 25,000 families and extending the programme to all parts of Sri Lanka, we believe that this initiative will turn out to be a platform to create much needed awareness and education about vision impairment and preventable blindness among Sri Lankans, Fonseka stated further.
The Sri Lankan Government has also appreciated Vision Care's effort in launching such a magnanimous scheme, as it strongly complements Vision 2020, the national programme developed by the government to eliminate avoidable blindness from Sri Lanka by the year 2020.
The application forms will be made available through Vision Care branches island-wide, and will be given out on a first-come-first-serve basis. More information on the opening and closing dates for applications will be informed through the media starting next week.

Vroom on a broom in newsroom
I believe in witches. No, not witchcraft but simply witches. Oh yes, witches are real. Some emphatically dont look like typical witch es with green skin, pointy hats, the broomstick conveyance or cackling laugh. But I did know a horrible harridan woman reporter who rode a powerful motorbike with reckless abandon. We uncharitably called her a road hag. Her motorbike was referred to as the baaaarrrroooooooommmm!
Although I did encounter at least one old crone with partially dyed green hair and a voice that sounded like a flock of crows cawing and pecking at a takarang roof. But I know for sure that they do exist. Throughout history there have been several famous, or rather notorious witches. But none so itchy, bitchy and witchy as some I have encountered in the journalistic profession. Unlike the Wicked Witch of the West and other witch stereotypes, they look and act fairly normal at first sight. Having spent a lifetime in a dozen or more newspapers both at home and abroad I know them when I see them.
I have come across some of the wackiest wiccans who brewed up so much trouble in their catty cauldrons that had editors climbing walls. I am not such a fool as to believe in witches that turn men into frogs simply by casting a spell on them. Yet, some of them are known to have made asses of men by kissing them and turning them into horny toads.
Now dont get me wrong. I am not saying that all female newswomen or women in general are witches. I have found the majority of them to be bewitching in the most delightful way. Many of them manifest several admirable traits such as charm compounded with astounding writing skills. Ask any woman journo who has worked with me or under my tenure as editor and they will attest to the fact that I am no male chauvinist piggy-wiggy.
That is because I have certainly not been stupid when it comes to interfering in the rights of women. All but bigoted buffoons underestimate the intelligence of the females of the species. I have learned by sheer experience that this perception is all too true. Insight comes naturally to women. They somehow have that inherent ability to see things intuitively which otherwise is not possible by logical thinking.
I am no Freudian pundit, but one thing I know for certain is that feminine intuition is a super sensory phenomenon. Well, there is a reason for all of this and there is absolutely no point in trying to understand it since it is one of the worlds greatest truisms that women are impossible to fathom. Greater men have tried and have been found wanting.
Part of the feminine brain linked to gut feelings is larger and more discerning in women. So disregard womans intuition at your peril, buddy boys. They dont need soothsayers or oracles because every woman is an Oracle. And they know it.
You see, some of the most magnificent and loyal friends, colleagues and subordinates I have been associated with are women. Some of the people I trust most in the world are women. I have had far more conflict in my life with men than I have had with women. The only difference is that I have been far more hurt and betrayed by men than I have by women. Ironically I have been sold down the river by many of those men who I have helped in their careers because of envy or ambition.
Now all this brings us to the logical theory of a witch switch in gender. In times of yore men witches were known as Warlocks which sounds pretty respectable in a masculine sort of way. But in my lexicon a witch is a witch is a witch, whether male or female.
And when you come to modern times you encounter a whole lot of both male and female hag cliques led by a queen hag, or closet queen fag organising office witch hunts. One of my deputy editors Steve was a fair and firm administrator. When a woman writer complained he was sexist in his assessment review of her work and had been going round calling her a witch he laughingly denied it. Amid chortles he said: How could I ever call you that when everyone knows for sure you cant cast spells or even spell properly.
On another occasion a woman feature writer, who knew she was dubbed the office witch, who was back from an overseas assignment handed him a highly overblown expense account chit. He sent it back with a memo stating: Did the hotels charge for broom service as well
There was a short, stubby mean-spirited copy editor named Sammy Jacks, who was a malevolent male misfit and a known bully.He consistently keptmaking attempts to browbeat a few trainee journalists. Beauty may be only skin deep, but he was ugly and I mean ugly, clean to the bone.
He really had his comeuppance when he called a willowy, radical female cub-reporter a witch. Little did he realise that the cutest editorial kitten had the sharpest claws. She fired back instantly: Why you ugly little toad, I would put a curse on you, but somebody appears to have beaten me to it! As the rest of the staff roared their mirthful approval she continued: I am not riding my broom because I am afraid I am flying off the handle!
She threatened that that she was so peed off with him that she would go to the toilet on his head and drown him.
Witnesses say she also gave him a painful jab in the ribs with her bony elbow for good measure. A terrified Sammy evidently did not wait to find out whether her elbow would be worse than her overflow. Besides, he had never learned to swim. He beat a hasty retreat as fast as his stubby little legs could carry him to a corner of the office where he sulked for months.
But not before he complained bitterly to Steve who admonished him with: Sammy, I know which witch is which. Of all the witches I have encountered I am aware that you are worst of them. We all know that you go vroom on a broom in the newsroom! What he didnt tell him was that the witty wench at the inquiry had called Sammy a witch with a capital B!

Wait and see what will happen after Vesak: MR
Kurunegala district MP and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa asked people to wait and see what will happen in the country after Vesak.
He was responding to media personnel when they questioned him about the Joint Opposition (JO) pledge to bring about a change after two poya days.
The media personnel made the query when the former President visited Anuradhapura on April 20 to pay homage to the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi and seek blessings for the New Year.
Mahinda Rajapaksa said the present government had miserably failed to bring about a positive change in the country as promised even though two years had elapsed since its victory.
He said the only change brought about was the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage mountain.
Rajapaksa said the present government had failed to match the amount of development work undertaken by his government which successfully won the war and established peace in the country. When he was in power, he had drawn up plans to relocate the garbage mountain in Puttalam and allocated funds for the project but the subsequent defeat at election prevented its implementation.He said his government always worked according to proper planning and showed success.
He said the May Day Rally at Galle Face would prove to be the most successful this year because people are getting ready to fill up the entire Galle Face Green on this day despite government manoeuvres to deprive them of using public transport facilities or private buses.
Mahinda Rajapaksa and his entourage called on Ruwanweli Chaityaramadhipati Ven. Pallegama Hemaratne Thera and lankarama Chaityaramadhipati Ven. Ralapanawe Dhammaajothi Thera and received their blessings. They visited the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi and participated in religious observances.
The Maha Sangha chanted seth pirith and invoked blessings on them. They also participated in religious observances at the Mirisavetiya.
Parliamentarians S.M. Chandrasena and S.C. Muthukumarana, Provincial Ministers S.M. Ranjith Samarakoon, K.H. Nandasena, and H.B. Semasinghe, North Central Provincial Council Chairman T.M.R. Siripala, Provincial Councillors Gamage Weerasena, K.P.S. Kumarasiri and former Anuradhapura Mayor H.P. Somadasa were present.

When a trash mountain spelt tragedy
Residents of the Colombo neighbourhood of Meethotamula had little idea that the urban-waste monster in their backyard would choose the Sinhala and Tamil New Years Day to collapse.
No tourist who has ever visited Colombo would associate the word garbage with the city. Possibly the cleanest capital city in South Asia, the sea-facing metropolis has for long been setting high benchmarks for the region. That is why last weeks garbage landslide near Colombowhen a pile of rubbish collapsed, killing at least 32 people and destroying nearly 150 homescame as a rude shock.
April 14 began well for residents of Meethotamula, a lower-middle class neighbourhood not far from the Sri Lankan Parliament. They marked the morning of their traditional Sinhala and Tamil New Years Day with prayers and temple visits. They had little idea that the urban-waste monster in their backyard would choose that day to collapse. That too, spelling a tragedy of such magnitude. In a matter of hours, the trash pile morphed from a health hazard to a massive death trap.
In the days that followed, the Army sifted layers of rubbish to look for bodies of those who were killed when the 300 feet (90 m) high pile of waste gave way.
Almost a week after the incident, crumbling concrete walls and slabs pop out of the slush, meek under the weight of a garbage mountain. At a nearby camp, survivors are organising funerals for their relatives, including children, who were caught unawares or died trying to help others.
It is not that residents did not draw attention to it earlier. In fact, they had been protesting since 2011, asking civic authorities to clear the dump site. The stench had become unbearable, and their children were often falling sick.
A preventable accident
Officials almost always responded, saying that a new project was in the pipeline, or that a long-term plan was being drafted. Neither took off. Conservancy agencies continued dumping nearly 800 tonnes of garbage every day at the same spot, the pile only mounting by the day. While the rest of Colombo sparkled, some thousand residents on the citys northeastern edge were paying the price.
Leaders, past and present, have only been quick to point fingers in the other direction. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose brother and then Secretary to the Ministry of Defence Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, led the urban development authority, tweeted saying the tragedy was preventable. He pointed to his governments 2014 plan for solid waste management, which he accused the successor government of ignoring.
While President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have assured residents of full support and compensation for relocation, some others in power have attributed the disaster to the failure of their predecessor government.
Now, a week after the incident and amidst a blame game played by politicians, Colombo looks and smells different. Piles of garbage stand unattended around street corners and shopping zones, choking the areas with the odour of perishing food waste and persistent plastic.
The government and its civic agencies are suddenly faced with a very basic questionwhere do we dump the citys waste Everywhere the conservancy vehicles go to empty the citys garbage, residents are erupting in protest.
In all probability, Colombos posher neighbourhoods will be the first to return to their cleaner days. Residents will continue segregating waste at source, as per the practice introduced by the government some months ago. But where will their waste head to this time

Xi urges restraint on N. Korea as US carrier nears
CHINA: Chinese President Xi Jinping urged restraint on North Korea in a phone call with Donald Trump Monday, as Japan joined drills with an American supercarrier heading to the Korean peninsula.
The US leader has repeatedly called on China, the North's sole major ally, to do more to rein in Pyongyang, as tensions in the flashpoint region soar amid speculation it will conduct another nuclear test.
(China) hopes that the relevant parties can maintain restraint and avoid actions that would increase tensions in the Korean Peninsula, Xi said according to the foreign ministry.
The only way to realise denuclearisation in the Korean peninsula and quickly resolve North Korea's nuclear problem is for each relevant party to fulfil its duties. The conversation -- the second since their summit at Trump's luxury resort in Florida early this month -- highlights rising concern in Beijing that tensions between Washington and Pyongyang could spiral into military conflict.
The international situation is rapidly changing, it is essential that China and the US maintain a close contact and exchange opinions on important matters in a timely manner, Xi told Trump.
Trump also spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Monday, discussing the joint drills under way between the US carrier Carl Vinson and Japan's Maritime Self-Defence Force.
We completely agreed that we strongly demand restraint by North Korea, which has repeatedly taken dangerous provocative actions, Abe told reporters after the call.
Tensions have soared in recent months as North Korean missile tests have brought ever-more bellicose warnings from Trump's administration -- and repeated demands for China do more to help.
Despite its longstanding ties with the North, China has stepped up pressure, announcing in February that it was halting all imports of coal from North Korea -- a crucial earner for Pyongyang -- for the rest of the year.
It also issued a stern warning earlier this month that a conflict over North Korea could break out at any moment.
The comments came ahead of a failed missile test coinciding with the 105th anniversary of the birth of North Korea's founder, Kim Il-Sung.
Missile and nuclear tests are often timed around major dates and speculation is now centring on the next event on the North's calendar, the anniversary on Tuesday of the founding of its military.
US Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday that the Vinson and its strike group would arrive in the Sea of Japan -- which sits between the Korean peninsula and Japan, in a matter of days.
South Korea also said it was considering drills with the carrier group, which is currently conducting joint exercises with Japan in the Philippine Sea.
Confusion had clouded the carrier's whereabouts after Trump indicated the armada was steaming towards North Korea when in fact it was heading south and was photographed off Java.
The ruling party newspaper in the North on Monday called the Vinson's deployment undisguised military blackmail.
Such threat may startle a jellyfish, but can never work on the DPRK, it said Monday, using the country's official name.
A separate editorial on the North's propaganda website Uriminzokkiri said that the dispatching of the Carl Vinson signalled a war: It is proof that an invasion of the North is nearing day by day. In the event of an attack, it said, The world will witness how Washington's rash nuclear aircraft carriers are turned into a huge pile of steel and buried at sea and how a country called America is wiped out from the Earth. The new US president has indicated he will not allow North Korea to achieve its goal of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the western United States.
Pyongyang insists it needs a powerful arsenal -- including atomic weapons -- to protect itself from what it says is the ever-present threat of invasion by hostile US forces.

Younis breaks 10,000-run barrier
Kingston, Sunday: Younis Khan became the first Pakistan player to complete 10,000 Test runs as his team reached 201 for four in reply to the West Indies first innings total of 286 at stumps on the third day of the rain-affected first Test at Sabina Park on Sunday.
Younis moved on from a painfully slow start to get to 58 while Babar Azam stroked 72 in dominating a 131-run third-wicket partnership with the former captain to give the tourists the ascendancy into the final session of the day.
However, fast bowler Shannon Gabriel dismissed both in the space of three deliveries to limit Pakistans progress and leaving captain Misbah-ul-Haq and Asad Shafiq to continue the workmanlike effort heading into the fourth day.
Having confirmed this series as the last before he retires from international cricket, 39-year-old Younis played with exaggerated care at the start of his innings. In contrast, Azam displayed much more aggression and purpose although he once again fell short of a maiden Test century.
Possibly mindful of his proximity to the landmark when he started his innings 23 runs away from the cherished goal, Younis took 47 minutes to get off the mark while Azam attempted to keep the scoreboard ticking over at the other end. Playing his first Test in the Caribbean after missing the 2011 tour due to the death of his brother, the former captain eventually started to creep towards his 10,000th run, triggering the celebrations when he swept a delivery from off-spinner Roston Chase in the first over after tea to the backward square-leg boundary to become just the 13th player overall -- and the oldest -- in the history of the game to scale that summit.
"I thought about bowing out of international cricket three years ago but one of the motivating factors for me to stay was to get to ten thousand runs," Khan said at the end of the day.
"I am finished after the series, no matter how many runs I score, but I just hope I have been able to make a useful contribution as a player and also help the younger ones to do as well as I have, or even better."
Hailed as a potential successor to Younis as the permanent occupant of the number three batting position, Azam enjoyed a moment of luck just after lunch when West Indies captain Jason Holder failed to hold on to a caught-and-bowled chance with the batsman on 12.
Yet just as it looked as if their partnership would continue until the close of play, Gabriel broke through.
Younis mistimed an off-drive to give to be caught at extra-cover and become the fast bowlers 50th Test wicket. Then in his next over a tentative Azam played on to spark further celebrations among the West Indian players.
Earlier, Holder finished unbeaten on 57 after the delayed start to another rain-affected day as Mohammad Amir completed his best Test innings figures to wrap up the home sides innings after they resumed at the overnight position of 278 for nine. He bowled last man Gabriel to finish with six for 44, an effort which improved on his previous best of six for 84 against England at Lords in 2010. Play started 90 minutes later than scheduled due to the continuing effects of heavy, torrential rain on a damp outfield which reduced play to just 55 minutes on the second day.
Pakistan started their reply brightly with Azhar Ali looking ominous before he chased a wide delivery from Alzarri Joseph to give a catch to wicketkeeper Shane Dowrich.
Ahmed Shehzad, playing his first Test for almost two years, also opened brightly with a flurry of shots, including five boundaries in 31 only to be trapped leg-before on the back foot by Holder. AFP
