End to political interference with curtailing of Executive powers - President

The era of political interference by the Executive in matters pertaining to the Judiciary and the Legislature ended with the curtailing of the powers of the Executive Presidency, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He made these observations while participating at the annual conference of the Judicial Service Association of Sri Lanka held at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo, yesterday.
The President said that he has taken his maximum efforts to restrict the powers of the Executive Presidency , which was more excessive in powers than in any other country in the world. He also said that several decisions were taken during the past 11 months , giving due precedence to good governance.
The President recalled the way protests were carried out in front of judges' houses and how judges' houses were stoned for the neglect of Executive orders, and how the then Chief Justice was impeached after a short period of a 48 hour inquiry for not obeying the Executive. President Sirisena said that the assault incident on the Secretary of the Judicial Services Commission was an added black mark to the Judicial service.
The new government has taken steps to build good governance in all the sectors of the country while balancing power between the Legislature, Executive, and the Judiciary, the President said.
President Sirisena pledged to create an environment in which judges will be able to deliver their judgments freely.
He also said that steps will be taken in the future to provide foreign training to enhance their knowledge, while understanding issues related to the Judicial Service.
The President pointed out the importance of finding solutions to the issue of delay in delivering a judgment when the public seeks justice. He said that the immediate attention of the persons engaged in the field of law should be drawn in this regard.
Minister of Justice Wijedasa Rajapakse, Chief Justice K. Sripavan, members of the Judicial Service Association of Sri Lanka and other officials and dignitaries were present at the occasion.

New laser-printed Mona Lisa 10,000 times smaller

UK: Scientists have successfully printed a microscopic version of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, which is 10,000 times smaller than the original painting, using a revolutionary new laser printing technology.
A nanotechnology breakthrough from Technical University of Denmark (DTU) revolutionises laser printing technology, allowing one to print high-resolution data and colour images in unprecedented quality and microscopic dimensions.
The laser technology allows printing in a resolution of 127,000 dots per inch (DPI). In comparison, weekly or monthly magazines are printed in a resolution equivalent to 300 DPI.
Using the new technology, researchers have reproduced a colour image of Mona Lisa which is less than one pixel on a smartphone display.
The version is 50 micrometres long or about 10,000 times smaller than the original Mona Lisa in the Louvre in Paris.
Printing the microscopic images requires a special nanoscale-structured surface, researchers said.
The structure consists of rows with small columns with a diameter of merely 100 nanometres each. This structured surface is then covered by 20 nanometres of aluminium.
As a laser pulse is transmitted from nanocolumn to another, it is heated locally, after which it melts and is deformed.
The temperature can reach up to 1,500 degrees Celsius, but only for a few nanoseconds, preventing the extreme heat from spreading.
The intensity of the laser beam determines which colours are printed on the surface, since the extent of column deformation decides which colour is reflected.
Low-intensity laser pulses lead to a minor deformation of the nanocolumn, resulting in blue and purple colour tone reflections.
Strong laser pulses create a drastic deformation, which gives the reflection from the nanocolumn an orange and yellow colour tone.
"Every time you make a slight change to the column geometry, you change the way it absorbs light. The light which is not absorbed is the colour that our eyes see," said N Asger Mortensen, professor at DTU.
"If the column absorbs all the blue light, for example, the red light will remain, making the surface appear red," Mortensen said.
"It will be possible to save data invisible to the naked eye. This includes serial numbers or bar codes of products and other information," said Anders Kristensen, from DTU.
"The technology can also be used to combat fraud and forgery, as the products will be labelled in way that makes them very difficult to reproduce," Kristensen said. The technology can also be used on a larger scale to personify products such as mobile phones with unique decorations, names, etc.

Officials of Diplomatic Missions to be recalled for training - Prime Minister
Plans are afoot to recall officials of the Sri Lanka's Diplomatic Missions next year to provide them a training on the government's policy, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He said that there were talented officials in foreign diplomatic missions, while while there are those who were not so. Some officials lacked even the basic knowledge about the government's policy. They have to be provided with a proper training concerning such matter. All the officials would be brought back to Sri Lanka to undergo training," Premier Wickremesinghe said." Officials of the foreign diplomatic missions would be unable to play the same pranks they played earlier. They would not be able to say that foreign countries stood against us. That era ended in 2014.
He made these observations while responding to a question raised by opposition MP Bimal Ratnayake for oral answers. The Premier responded while Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva was resonding to Bimal Ratnayake. MP Ratnayake stated that the previous government appointed persons to foreign diplomatic missions, who did not belong to the Sri Lankan Foreign Service.
"It is only at present that those officials attempt to study what the government policy was. It would take a period of two to three years to build up a strong foreign service," Premier Wickremesinghe said. "We could build up a good foreign service.
The UNP has commendable foreign relationship than foreign diplomatic missions. We could impart that experience to the foreign service," he said
"Out of the 47 persons appointed to foreign diplomatic missions by the present government, 23 did not belong to the permanent Sri Lankan Foreign Service," Bimal Ratnayake said. "But there is a policy that only 30 percent could be appointed to foreign diplomatic missions out of those who do not belong to foreign diplomatic missions.
At this stage the Premier stated that there is no such agreement on policy that point out such a proportionate. "Suitable persons should be appointed to the foreign diplomatic missions," Premier Wickremesinghe said.
"No where in the world could such a proportionate be maintained. We too don't hope to maintain such a policy. We would appoint 100 percent of those who are qualified persons." At this stage Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that some members of the UNP Working Committee have been appointed to foreign diplomatic missions.
"I became the first Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister. We have to work between the countries and some of the officials of the foreign diplomatic mission lacked the necessary foreign relationship." Premier Wickremesinghe said. But the members of the UNP Working Committee could solve international matters via the telephone.
He also said that the government needed to develop relationships with some countries, adding He that such relationships are being built with the USA. "The benefits of UNPs relationships would be brought to Sri Lanka," the Premier said.
Although there is no High Commissioner in UK, we have sound relationships with UK."
At this stage opposition MP Bimal Ratnayake stated that he condemned such a statement by the Prime Minister, as it would be understood that a foreign service was not needed but only clerks would suffice.
"The matters concerning Geneva were settled by me as the Foreign Minister and the Ministry Secretary, the Premier said.
"Since late Prime Minister D. S. Senanayaka's period, diplomatic matters were settled politically.

Bridge connecting Rameshwaran and Thalaimannar:
Sri Lanka opposes India's proposal - Kiriella
The Sri Lankan government was opposed to India's proposal to build a bridge connecting Rameshwaram of Southern India and Thalaimannar, Leader of the House and University Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella told a group of journalists yesterday.
The minister was commenting on the Indian Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari's statement to the Lok Sabha last Wednesday.
He said that India had planned to build a sea bridge and tunnel connecting Sri Lanka, but Sri Lanka would not agree with the proposed project.
"We could not let India build the Sea Bridge connecting Rameswaram with Thalaimannar as the people of Sri Lanka would be against it," the Minister said. Indian Minister Gadkari on Wednesday in a statement in the Lok Sabha has said: "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has pledged to fully finance a bridge-building project connecting Rameshwaram and Sri Lanka.
The project was also discussed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with his counterpart during the latter's recent visit."
The India - Sri Lanka connectivity project's cost is pegged at about 24,000 Indian Crore.

Is the government importing coconuts, queries MP Handunnetti
JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti speaking in Parliament yesterday, urged the government to express its stance whether coconuts are being imported to the country or not.
He was joining the committee stage debate of Budget 2016, under the financial heads of eight Ministries referred to the Select Committee.
He said the government had given an assurance earlier that it would not allow the import of coconuts to Sri Lanka, but this budget has proposed to import coconuts to the country.
Import of coconuts to the country would lead to a collapse of the local coconut industry. Therefore, the government should not do so, but the government should take short and or long-term measures to improve coconut cultivation instead of importing coconuts.
Handunnetti said the tea industry too is on the verge of collapse due to low prices. It is necessary that measures be taken to ensure a reasonable price for tea growers in the country.

Budget would help enhance living conditions of estate sector - Thondaman
Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) Leader MP Arumugam Thondaman told in Parliament yesterday, that the CWC would support the government's good projects, while the government should not marginalize the estate people considering them as a minority.
He also said that Budget 2016 would help the estate community to enhance their living conditions.
He said that estate workers have to face various hardships due to the reduction of tea prices and the prevailing weather condition of the country. When we urge the estate owners to increase the salaries of workers, they claim that they could not do so, as the government had cut down subsidies.
We also urged them to adjust the working hours of estate workers, considering weather conditions prevailing in the area. The CWC Leader also urged the government to continue with the development projects initiated by the previous regime.
New adjustment between taxes on new vehicles and budget proposals - Finance Minister
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake clarified yesterday in Parliament that there was an adjustment made between the new taxes imposed on motor vehicles and the new budget proposals on vehicles, but there was no intention whatsoever to use these laws to clear vehicles from the Customs.
Although there was a mechanism to release vehicles by the Customs prior to January 8, we formulated a system to release vehicles based on their actual value.
There had been allegations in the media about the release of 700 vehicles which have been undervalued and ordered to be released from Customs without levying the actual import duty.
He said that those who had imported these vehicles were asked to pay a duty surcharge of 35 per cent. The minister said the Government had also taken steps to stop the release of containers carrying undervalued goods until the importers pay the duty on the actual value of the goods.
"We got to know that there were instances of under invoicing to import expensive vehicles. We had discussions with Customs officers and importers to formulate a valuation mechanism for importing vehicles. We decided on an official value of those vehicles. We stopped the clearing of vehicles by illegal manner and imposed a very high tax on such imports. After adding this to the budget, we were told that vehicles could be imported at lower rates. This is being projected as a big fraud.
These vehicles are not cleared until the budget and we realized that the sercharge tax was more than the tax imposed. So we wanted to be fare by the importers and consumers. This hue and cry is because all
these times, illegal proceedings from the clearing of vehicles went to a few people during the previous regime and now it has been completely stopped.
Electronic ID cards with biometric data for citizens
Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S. B. Nawinna told Parliament yesterday, that immediate measures would be taken to issue electronic identity cards containing biometric data.
Joining the committee stage debate on budget proposals 2016, Minister Nawinna said that the Ministry also hoped to provide biometric passports.
Measures have also been taken to bring in amendments to the Registration of Persons Act and the proposal had been submitted for Cabinet approval. Measures would also be taken to issue electronic Identity Cards in both Sinhala and Tamil languages. The Department of Registration of Persons too will also be restructured.
He also said that measures have also been taken to establish 35 cultural centres island wide. Construction activities of the International Cultural Centre in Navimana, Matara, have already commenced. The estimated cost of the project is Rs.1,045 million.
He further added that an insurance scheme would also be introduced to artistes, while plans afoot to provide them with modern equipment and welfare facilities.
The Ministry had also commenced special projects for the development of the North Western province, he said.
Policies to increase forest cover to be formulated - Niroshan Perera
Policies to increase forest cover up to 33 percent would be formulated next year, said the National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Niroshan Perera.
He made this observation in response to a question raised by UNP Parliamentarian Buddhika Pathirana for an oral answer in Parliament yesterday.
The State Minister stated that the forest cover in the country had declined to 29 percent in 2010 and added that steps have already been taken to increase this percentage up to 33 percent.
He also said that President Maithripala Sirisena had promised to protect the forest cover considering the importance of the matter.
The State Minister further said that legal action would be taken against those who have committed crimes of wild gaming and illegal cultivation in forests, irrespective of their positions.
When MP Buddhika Pathirana said that it was reported that wild game is available for sale in Matara and in many other cities, State Minister said that the government had not received such reports.
'Budget allocations to villages for rural development amount to Rs. 21,000 million'
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardane told Parliament yesterday, that Budget 2016 had allocated Rs.1.5 million to each village which would amount to Rs. 21,000 million for country's rural development.
Joining the committee stage debate on Budget Proposals 2016, Minister Abeywardane said that the government planned to devolve power up to village level through the "Grama Rajya" system.
"There would be no political interference with the Grama Rajya process, as it would be continued through village level committee, headed by Grama Niladaris," he said.
Currently, there are about 917 Grama Niladari vacancies available and class 1 Grama Niladaris are available in only 173 divisions.
"With these limited resources, we have to implement the Grama Rajya process for the betterment of the country," he added.
Smart phones for journalists next year - Harin Fernando
Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando told in Parliament yesterday, that decisions have been taken to provide smart phones for islandwide journalists and a data package would also be provided at a concessionary rate.
He said that smart phones and data packages would be provided from next year to all journalists registered at the Media Ministry and also hope to digitalize all media institutions through modern technology. He was joining the committee stage debate on Budget proposals 2016.
Minister Fernando also said that a proper mechanism would be implemented to bring modern technology to the the village.
He further added that a phone and a "Meth Kalaguna" package would also be provided to senior citizens and while tabs too would be provided to University students.
Country's main issue to uplift its rural economy - Minister Harrison
Rural Economy Minister P. Harrison told in Parliament yesterday, that the country's main issue is to uplift rural economy.
Previous regimes had taken various measures, including the Jana Saviya and the Samurdhi to uplift the rural economy. But still, the rural economy of the country had not been uplifted to its expected level.
To uplift the rural economy, we would have to provide better prices for rural products. So we are planning to take measures to upgrade economic centres with freezing facilities to create a good market for fruits and vegetables.
Earlier, the government purchased only five percent of the country's paddy production, while this year we could be able to purchase 10 percent of the total paddy production.
Speaking about the farmers' protest that was held on Thursday, Minister Harrison said that last year the government allocated only Rs. 30 billion for the fertilizer subsidy, while the budget 2016 had allocated Rs.37 billion in this regard.
He also emphasized the necessity of finding an alternative to agro chemicals in order to eradicate kidney diseases rapidly spreading in agricultural areas.
If plantations not given salary increase:
Vadivel Suresh warns govt of suicide
UNP MP Vadivel Suresh yesterday, threatened to commit suicide by setting himself on fire in the chamber of Parliament if the plantation sector workers are not given a salary hike by today.
He was participating in the committee stage debate on the expenditure heads of the Ministry of Plantation Industries.
He alleged that the government had failed to understand the hard work done by estate workers and the plight of their miserable lives.
The plantation workers had been neglected by previous regimes in the past, despite the fact that they continued to work for the betterment of the national economy.
If the government will not take measures to increase the salaries of estate workers, I will set myself on fire. The MP said that the next couple of hours were very decisive. The MP pointed out that salaries of the doctors and public sector employees have been increased during the budget debate was in progress and asked as to why the government could not increase the salaries of the plantation workers. There are 274,411 plantation workers in the country, he said.

Putin calls Trump an 'outstanding, talented' man

RUSSIA: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday described US Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump as a talented and outstanding man, welcoming his stance on Russia.
"He is a very outstanding man, unquestionably talented," Putin told journalists after his annual press conference in Moscow.
"It's not up to us to judge his virtue, that is up to US voters, but he is the absolute leader of the presidential race," Putin added.
Putin said Russia is ready to work with the United States no matter who is elected president next year. "We are ready to work with any president chosen by the American people."
Trump, a tycoon and onetime reality television star who has unexpectedly become leader of the Republican presidential candidates' race, has been gaining both fans and enemies recently for his inflammatory remarks against Muslims.
He has vowed to ban all Muslims from entering the United States if he succeeds in his bid to become the next US president.
British Prime Minister David Cameron on Wednesday called Trump's comments "divisive, stupid and wrong."
Putin said that Trump's comments to his domestic audience while on the campaign trail were not Russia's concern, but added that he likes the Republican hopeful's statements on Russia.
"On domestic politics, his manner of speaking, what he employs to raise his popularity" -- that is none of Russia's business, Putin said. "It's not our concern to evaluate his work."
Some of Trump's statements on Putin are apparently music to the Russian president's ear.
"He says that he wants a different level of relations, tighter and deeper relations with Russia, how can we not welcome that Of course we welcome it," Putin said.
Trump was asked Wednesday what he would do to get Russia's military presence out of Syria, and answered that he would first get Putin's respect.
"I will get along -- I think -- with Putin, and I will get along with others, and we will have a much more stable -- stable world," Trump said. "I would talk to him. I would get along with him."
But Trump also said in October he would like to "sit back" and watch as Russia continues air strikes in Syria, suggesting it could be a "trap" that could bog down Moscow.

Rousseff scores court win in impeachment case

BRAZIL: Brazil's Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Congress must restart impeachment proceedings against Dilma Rousseff from scratch and overhauled the procedure, in a badly needed win for the embattled president.
In an 8-3 decision, the judges annulled an opposition-dominated impeachment commission established by secret ballot in the lower house last week and ordered the procedure be restarted in an open vote.
It also gave the final word on whether to open an impeachment trial to the Senate, where Rousseff has greater support.
Rousseff is accused of fudging the government's accounts during her re-election campaign last year.
The 68-year-old leftist maintains the budgeting manoeuvres were accepted practice.
Under the court's ruling, a new commission to decide whether or not to impeach her must now be created in an open vote by the lower house.
If the commission recommends impeachment, the decision will then pass to the full lower house -- and then, the judges ruled, to the Senate.
The march towards the unpopular president's possible ouster was stalled by her allies in Congress, who say opposition legislators violated the constitution in their rush toward impeachment.
They claimed the impeachment commission illegally insisted on secret votes while picking its members, and that it was stacked with Rousseff opponents.
On December 8 the Supreme Court ordered the commission to freeze its work until the challenge was resolved.
The speaker of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha, oversaw the controversial session to form the commission and is an architect of the impeachment drive.
Cunha himself has been charged with taking millions of dollars in bribes.
The political crisis and a separate corruption scandal involving state oil giant Petrobras have exacerbated the malaise gripping Brazil, whose economy, the world's seventh largest, is mired in a deep recession.

Unrest puts heavy damper on Bethlehem Christmas festivities

PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES: Near the church in Bethlehem's Manger Square, built over the site where Christians believe Jesus was born, tour guides pace back and forth, waiting in vain for tourist buses that fail to show.
Hisham Khamis, a guide for 10 years, stands forlorn under a huge Christmas tree decorated in the black, white, red and green colours of the Palestinian flag.
In recent years "at least 60-70 buses would arrive every morning," he said. "These days... there are four or five, occasionally 10."
Bethlehem is preparing for the traditional midnight Christmas mass at the Church of the Nativity, but the atmosphere this year is less than festive.
A wave of violence and protests has deterred many tourists from making the annual pilgrimage to the ancient city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, though much of the unrest has occurred away from Bethlehem, usually considered a safe destination.
Even so, clashes between stone-throwing young Palestinians and Israeli troops have raged outside Bethlehem hotels, already badly hit by a drop in guests since Israel built a West Bank separation wall that forces visitors from nearby Jerusalem to go through a military checkpoint to get to the town.
On a recent day, the smell of teargas and a foul-smelling spray known as "skunk", which the Israeli army uses against protesters, still hung heavy in the air. Palestinian officials say Bethlehem hotels that are usually 80-90 percent full at this time of year have not reached even half that level. The drop is a major concern for a city that lives largely on tourism and where unemployment exceeds 20 percent.
Jamal Shehada, who runs a shop selling Santa hats, rosaries and other souvenirs, blames Israeli guides who meet tourists from their flights at the international airport outside Tel Aviv.
With no airport in the Palestinian territories, tourists headed for Christian sites there must start their visit in the Jewish state.
"They tell tourists that there are only terrorists in Bethlehem, and many of them say to themselves, 'We'd be better off buying our souvenirs from the Israelis rather than in Bethlehem'," Shehada says. He adds that the army has increased the number of roadblocks around Bethlehem, where streets once teeming with tourists during the Christmas period are now empty.
That has been in response to the violence that erupted at the beginning of October, including Palestinian gun, knife and car-ramming attacks targeting Israelis.

US, Cuba to resume regular flights

US: The United States and Cuba on Thursday announced plans to resume flights between the two nations, erasing another vestige of what had been strained ties rooted in the Cold War.
The latest progress as the countries work to build on their restoration of full diplomatic relations this summer was made public a year to the day after President Barack Obama and counterpart Raul Castro first said they would bury the hatchet.
In a short statement, the US State Department said that on Wednesday Washington and Havana had reached "a bilateral arrangement to establish scheduled air services between the two countries."
This does not mean American tourists can now start flocking to communist-run Cuba to lie on beaches, sip rum and fire up cigars.
Such travel remains illegal because the trade embargo that the Americans slapped on Cuba in 1960 after Fidel Castro came to power in a communist revolution remains in effect.
In a statement marking the anniversary of the start of reconciliation, Obama renewed his call for the Republican-controlled Congress to lift the embargo, which he termed the "legacy of a failed policy."
Republicans are wary of rewarding Cuba until it improves its human rights record.
Until now only charter flights were permitted. Current US law also allowed for special permits to visit Cuba, and the criteria for getting one of these was loosened in January.
