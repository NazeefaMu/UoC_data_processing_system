Govt needs to lower excise duties for tourism sector
Sri Lanka needs to address several burning issues in the tourism sector very soon, said the new Chairman of Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau Udaya Nanayakkara. Speaking at the launch press conference of the Hotel Show Colombo 2017 at Hotel Ramada on Monday, he said that Sri Lanka needs to break the monopoly of the Colombo airport and look at offering more open sky agreements to attract more airlines to Colombo.
In addition, Sri Lanka should re-look some of the age-old excise regulations which restricts serving of liquor in hotels. Also, the Excise Department should revisit some of exorbitant fees that are levied in the tourism sector. These are definitely overpriced and have to be revised soon.
Nanayakkkara also said that the delay in clearing of garbage and negative publicity generated through it along with the rising of the dengue epidemic would have a negative impact for the tourism industry. Infrastructure in the city of Colombo City too has to improve.
He also said that Colombo should have more entertainment and it should be marketed separately as a happening city.
Nanayakkara said that they are launching several programmes to increase tourist spending per day from US$ 163 to US$ 210 soon.
Colombo would add a further 3,000 star-class rooms in two years and this will also result in opening up 6,000 new jobs for which quality staff have to be trained.
Chairman Sri Lanka Institute of Hospitality Management Sunil Dissanayake said that today due to high demand, salaries of hotel sector employees have increased and are almost in par with countries like Dubai.
He said that the HR issue in the industry is now being addressed with both private sector hotels and government sector bodies like National Youth Service Council, National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority producing hotel sector employees.
Hotel Show Colombo 2017 will be held from June 30 to July 2 July at BMICH. The theme of the event, Move Forward  think Green  Maximize Sustainability will be reflected throughout the show.
Hotel Show Colombo 2017, the largest hospitality show is organized by the Ceylon Hotel Schools Graduates Association (CHSGA), is backed by the Government and Tourist Authority of Sri Lanka.
Apart from featuring an impressive host of international and local brands, this augmented edition of Hotel Show Colombo 2017 will, for the first time, feature seven vital segments of the hospitality and allied sectors, namely Hotel Show Exhibition, Colombo Food Festival, Bocuse dOr live cooking competition organized by Bocuse dOr Sri Lanka, National Barista Championship, Room Stylist Challenge, seminars and hospitality industry business gathering. Seminars will cover three key topics; Financial Sustainability, Reaching the New Age Customers and Importance of Environment Sustainability for Tourism, which will add value to both buyers and sellers.
Also in the pipeline are various events and activities to be staged alongside the Hotel Show, designed to bring industry players in the hotel, restaurant and foodservice sectors closer to buyers.
The Hotel Show Colombo 2017 will give local exhibiting companies a boost and exposure to regional and international markets by building on their networks and distribution channels. At the same time, visitors will be able to discover the latest technologies and innovations that our home-grown companies provide, says Sanjeeva Perera, President Ceylon Hotel School Graduates Association.

Poor waste management worsens dengue menace
Increasing issues of waste management around the country has been seen to add to the rising dengue epidemic in the country.
Last year we had 55,000 patients but during the first six months of this year alone, we have surpassed that number.
We are at 65,000 patients at present, Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH), Senior Consultant Physician and dengue expert Dr Ananda Wijewickrama said.
We had our biggest outbreak last year but since then numbers have been growing at a faster rate, he said. Over 200 have been killed due to the outbreak this year, he said.
Dr. Wijewickrama said number of cases have been on the rise for several months now but had gone unnoticed among the general public and very little attention paid to arrest it.
The doctor said the outbreak this year had started earlier on, during the dry season in February and March; an unusual phenomenon as dengue is more prevalent during the wet season, The rains were erratic even during the dry season. So we were starting from a bigger base number this year compared to last, he said.
Adding to this issue was the worsening waste management crisis the country is experiencing at present, with waste disposal not happening properly and preventive programmes not being taken seriously by individuals and organisations, the situation is worsening, Dr Wijewickrama said.
Waste management has been a dire issue around the country with the issue of garbage becoming severe in the areas of Colombo, Hatton, Kandy, Kurunegala, Puttlam, Kalmunai, and Trincomalee among other cities.
The local government authorities responsible for waste management were dissolved in 2015 and are at present run by Commissioners coming under the purview of Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Mustapha.

Commission wont take Auditor Generals Treasury bond loss calculations as gospel truth
The Auditor Generals method of calculation will not be taken as the gospel when deciding on a method to calculate a possible loss incurred at the Treasury bond auction of February 27 2015, Commissioner, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena said yesterday.
Just because the Auditor General has proposed a method to calculate the possible loss incurred by this questioned transaction, we will not take it as the gospel, Commissioner Justice Jayawardena pointed out. Nor shall we take what the Monetary Board has to say about it as the gospel either, Justice Jayawardena said.
We will have to figure out a way to decide on a method and a formula to calculate the possible losses, Justice Jayawardena pointed out.
Jayawardena said so when attention was drawn to a Monetary Board paper dated March 3 2017, where in which the Monetary Board notes that the assumptions made in the AGs report seems to be fair as the Public Debt Department practice was to issue Treasury Bonds through direct placements between weighted average yield rate and the cut off yield rate prior to February 21, 2015. Some other board papers relating to the same subject were produced to the Commission as well.
Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva pointed out to the Commission that these documents are provided to give credence to the formulation used by the Auditor General in his loss calculation incorporated in his audit report on the matter.
The Commission needs to look into all the documents and whatever the evidences that may be of assistance to us when deciding upon an accurate method of calculation, Commission Chairman Supreme Court Judge, Justice K.T. Chitrasiri pointed out.
The question that we have to take into account is, AG Wijesinghe has adopted a certain method of calculation.
It is for us to decide whether that method was reasonable or not. In deciding that, the view of the Central Bank is important and is of assistance to us. Justice Jayawardena also said.
Meanwhile, counsel Harsha Fernando produced the minutes of the same board papers where another Monetary Board member has expressed thoughts regarding the above content noted.
The evidence was led through Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe, who was testifying before the Presidential Commission that inquires into the Treasury bond issue for the seventh day.
Commissioner Jayawardena also questioned the witness on a letter prepared by the World Bank regarding the questioned Treasury bond transaction.
The letter was received by the Central Bank Sri Lanka. Asked if he was aware of this letter, AG Wijesinghe said he was.Commissioner Jayawardena asked whether the said letter states that there is no specific method to calculate losses incurred by transactions of this nature. AG Wijesinghe confirmed so.
He also answered in affirmative when asked if the letter also states that there is no specific formula to calculate losses incurred by transactions of this nature as well.
The letter prepared by the World Bank also states that when calculating a loss a counter factual should be taken into consideration, it was noted. Asked if he took the direct placement rate as the counter factual, AG Wijesinghe said it was so.

The increase in the use of technology in the financial industry (fintech) is changing the face of entire banking and financial sector with filling the void of inaccessibility to financial services, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said.
The financial sector is continuously coming up with new and seamless ways to provide services to the global population and Fintech is having a transformative impact on overall banking and financial sector, governor Coomaraswamy said adding that as a result , the entire banking model will become totally unrecognizable in another 10-15 years.
Dr. Coomaraswamy was speaking at the 22nd convocation of the Institute of Bankers of Sri Lanka (IBSL) held in BMICH recently.
According to him, education has become more important and even higher premium is placed in human capital development for us to be able to meet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities that are being created by rapid technological change.
In the past, technology has transformed the production processes and working patterns in manufacturing, today that is also being now extended for the service sector. Financial services sector is also no exception. he said.
He also noted that IBSL as the only institution, authorised to offer banking qualifications in Sri Lanka, would really have a significant role to play in preparing future generations to cope with challenges of a digitalised and globalized era.
The role of bankers in preparing the banking staff to meet these challenges will also increase as time goes on, he said.
Meanwhile, The Institute of Bankers of Sri Lanka, which provides diploma in Banking and Finance is hoping to introduce a degree program in Banking and Finance for the first time in Sri Lanka in the near future.

Indian govt in talks with RBI to defer Basel-III norms for banks
The Indian government is in discussion with the Reserve Bank of India to explore ways to defer the full implementation of international capital norms or Basel-III norms for Indian banks which are floundering in bad debt.
An extended timeline to meet the capital needs would provide the necessary breather to banks to lend more while they grapple with bad loans and raise capital.
It is imperative for banks to meet the Basel-III regulatory norms by March 2019.
According to the norms laid down by RBI, Indian lenders have to maintain a minimum common equity ratio of 8% and total capital ratio of 11.5% by 2019.
As of March 2017, state-run banks maintain an average common equity ratio of 8.5%.
Some public sector banks (PSBs) are however struggling and already four lenders are under the prompt corrective action plan of the regulator.
According to RBI estimates, state-run banks would require Rs 1 lakh crore while the entire banking sector would require an additional capital requirement of Rs 5 lakh crore to meet the norms by 2019.
Banks may not be able to raise the required capital, which would curtail their ability to lend.
This comes at a time when stressed assets of banks rose to Rs 7.4 lakh crore at the end of March 2017 from Rs 7 lakh crore a year ago. A senior finance ministry official said that some discussion has been held on this issue and the regulator is also open to the suggestion.
It would support banks as they are all set to tackle bad loans under the new norms approved by the government and RBI, the official said.
An email sent to RBI did not elicit any response till the time of going to press.

Ministry has started to recognise Treasury bonds at face value:Auditor General
The Ministry of Finance for a decade or more has been understating the liability of Treasury bonds, when preparing its financial statements based on the discount value of the Treasury bonds issued instead of the face value of the same, Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe said.
However, from the year 2016 the Finance Ministry has started to recognise the Treasury bonds at face value,AG Wijesinghe said.
Due to this long prevailing understating, a gap of Rs.506 billion has occurred in public debt,AG Wijesinghe further said. This is the reason why I disclaimed the Finance Ministry financial statements, he pointed out.
AG Wijesinghe said so while testifying before the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue, yesterday. He also said the Ministry of Finance is not legally bound to apply Sri Lankan accounting and auditing standards when preparing accounts, but it could apply them if wants to.

More interest-rate pressure for Sri Lankan Corporates - Fitch
Fitch Ratings expects rising domestic interest rates to hurt Sri Lankan corporates over the next 12 months.
Their borrowing costs have increased more than 200bp in the 12 months to March 2017 as the Central Bank of Sri Lanka increased policy rates by 125bp and the statutory reserve ratio by 150bp in an attempt to reign in aggressive credit growth.
Fitch does not expect the pressure on interest rates to ease in the near term owing to rising inflationary pressures and weak external finances. Annual inflation as measured by the Colombo consumer price index rose to 8.4% in April 2017 from 4.3% a year ago.
Corporates with high short-term working capital requirements such as retail and manufacturing companies are hurt the most by the recent rate increases. In Fitchs view, the two large consumer-durable retailers, Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC (A-(lka)/Stable) and Abans PLC (BBB+(lka)/Stable), are the most affected of the entities we rate as most of their borrowings consist of short-term working capital financing and will have to be rolled over at higher rates.
Furthermore, both companies realise 30%-40% of their sales through hire-purchase schemes which can meaningfully weaken with rising interest rates and slow EBITDA growth. Fitch believes Singer has more headroom in its current rating to withstand these challenges compared with Abans.
Kotagala Plantations PLC (CC(lka)) may also face further liquidity pressure on account of higher interest payments. Fitch believes Hemas Holdings PLC (AA-(lka)/Stable) and Sunshine Holdings PLC (A(lka)) to be the least affected due to their low refinancing requirements during the next 12 months.
The interest coverage (EBITDA/gross interest expense) of corporates that Fitch rates deteriorated to 6.9x on average in the 12 months ended March 2017 from 9.2x a year ago because of the rising rates and higher debt. Debt increased mostly on account of investments in new capacity in sectors such as retail and manufacturing, which may take longer to translate into meaningful cash flows. Fitch estimates interest coverage may fall to 5.2x by the end of the current financial year if interest rates were to rise by 100bp. If interest rates were to rise by 200bp, coverage would weaken further to 4.8x. These estimates are based on our expectations that Fitch-rated corporates EBITDA will grow by around 1% on average over this period, and debt will increase by 6%.
We have assumed that 100% of corporates short-term debt and 40% of long-term debt will be re-priced at higher rates immediately. Most of the long-term debt stems from banks and around half of such debt are at a variable interest rate.
As of end-March 2017, almost 50% of the outstanding borrowings of Fitch-rated corporates consisted of short-term borrowings primarily funding working capital, exposing the companies to modest interest-rate risk at the point of refinancing. Only 12% of the outstanding borrowings of Fitch-rated corporates consisted of debenture financing, which is predominantly on fixed rates.

The House Democracy Partnership (HDP) of the United States Congress welcomed members of parliament of four HDP partner countries, including Sri Lanka to an exchange programme in the second week of June.
A bipartisan group of members of the Sri Lankan Parliament comprising State Minister of Agriculture Wasantha Aluwihare, Deputy Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment Anuradha Jayaratne, Keheliya Rambukwella, Buddhika Pathirana and Eswarapatham Saravanapavan participated in this programme.
The exchange programme allowed the members of parliament to share lessons and experiences with their peers on the parliaments role and interacted with U.S. members of congress, congressional staff and U.S. experts on matters such as improving citizen security, social inclusion, peace building, reconciliation and stimulating economic growth in post conflict societies.
The Sri Lanka Parliament and the House Democracy Partnership of the U.S. House of Representatives entered into a Collaboration Agreement to strengthen partnership between the two legislatures last September.

Navin orders quick credit to flood-affected tea small holders
Minister of Plantation Industries Navin Dissanayake has taken a decision to offer instant low interest credit of Rs. 150, 000 and also free tea plants to tea small holders whose estates were destroyed by the recent floods.
The Minister has also instructed the Secretary of the Ministry J.A. Ranjith to explore the possibility of offering a substantial allowance for fully affected tea estate owners for a longer period.
The meeting in this regard was held last week at the Ministry with Chairman, Tea Small Holders Authority, Wijeratne Devagedara and Chairman, All Ceylon Tea Small Holders Association, Neville Ratnayake, in attendance.
It was pointed out that several tea smaller holders in four districts were affected due to the recent floods.
Tea Small Holdings Development Authority (TSHDA), an industry association consisting of small-scale tea cultivators, predicted a considerable fall in tea production in the upcoming months as some of the main tea cultivating districts were severely hit by the recent floods.
The deluge is estimated to have destroyed around 10,000 acres of small holder tea plantations, particularly in the Ratnapura, Kalutara, Matara and Gale Districts.

'No alternative other than renewable energy'
Sri Lanka has no alternative other than going for sustainable natural resource management by tapping huge renewable energy (RE) sources to meet future demand of energy and environmental sustainability, said Bio Energy Association of Sri Lanka, President Eng. Parakrama Jayasinghe.
He was speaking at the Private Finance Advisory Network - Asia (PFAN-ASIA) Forum for Climate and Clean Energy Financing (AFCCEF8) Road Show, held in Colombo recently.
Sri Lanka's renewable energy developers and consultants including those from bio mass, wind, solar, biogas and mini-hydro enterprises attended the forum.
Jayasinghe said the development of the RE sector in Sri Lanka has also been quite slow and it is the duty of all potential investors to come forward and support the initiative of PFAN to help country's RE developers.
This was the first road show held to create the awareness of local RE developers about the PFAN initiative and also to explore international financing source towards the development of the renewable energy sector in Sri Lanka.
PFAN is a promotional agency to bring together developers of renewable energy projects and potential investors.
PFAN is now accepting proposals to be forwarded at the eighth Asia Forum for Clean Energy Financing (AFCEF-8) Business Plan Competition. Applications for the competition are expected before July 19.
Jayasinghe said several organizations have already come to support the PFAN initiative to help renewable energy developers in our country.
He said the aim of PFAN is to bring together developers and potential investors to make the country's RE sector a success.
According to Jayasinghe, Sri Lanka has so far not been able to get any benefits from this initiative. PFAN is keen to rekindle this interest.
He said PFAN has appointed a new country representative to attract the country's renewable energy developers to participate in the forthcoming Asia Forum for Climate and Clean Energy Financing (AFCCEF8).
Green and Clean Energy (Pvt) Ltd, Director P. R.Wijewardena said green energy comes from natural sources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, plants, algae and geothermal heat and these energy resources are renewable.
He said fossil fuels are a finite resource and take millions of years to develop and thereafter it will continue to diminish. Renewable resources are also important in reducing air pollution and mitigate adverse climate effects.
He said according to the latest United Nations climate report on man-made global warming, that fossil fuels needed to be eliminated from the energy supply in the coming decades to avoid catastrophe.
He said the main barrier faced by our RE developers is the access to affordable capital, equity and debt and they can be overcome these with the forthcoming PFAN programme.
He also said the Government has taken many step to develop RE projects by establishing the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) in 2007 and also establishing the Surya Bala Sangramaya.
He said that PFAN will also work with several industry associations to activate the RE sector by helping them with technical inputs and advice.
"In addition, many state agencies are playing a supporting role, such as the CEA, provincial councils, Forest Department, and Irrigation Department as the representatives of the Project Approving Committee of the SLSEA, he said.
Bio Energy Association of Sri Lanka Council Member Nelson Nagasinghe said he was happy to see that there are many RE developers who have been trying to initiate new projects in Sri Lanka.
However, one great barrier faced by them is that of access to affordable capital, equity and debt and that can be overcome by the PFAN programme which aims to bring together RE developers and many international investors together, he said.
He said RE projects could mitigate climate change. He said achieving energy security in Sri Lanka through renewable energy plays major role in economic green growth. Therefore the development of RE sources is a national priority for energy security in Sri Lanka.
He recalled that the energy policy of the country clearly states that at least 20% of power generation in the country should be achieved through renewable sources by the year 2020.

No plans for Brexit concessions: EU
The EU's chief negotiator said there would be "substantial" consequences from Brexit after the first round of talks with the UK.
Michel Barnier said he was "not in the frame of mind to make concessions or ask for concessions".
UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said talks got off to a "promising start".
The UK appears to have conceded to the EU's preferred order for the talks which will mean trade negotiations do not begin immediately.
Davis and Barnier gave a joint press conference after day one of the talks in Brussels.
The initial focus will be on expat rights, a financial settlement and "other separation issues".
Discussions aimed at preserving the Good Friday Agreement and common travel area in Ireland will also begin, although Davis suggested these issues may not be settled until the end of the process, when the UK's trade relationship with the EU is settled.
The UK had wanted talks on its future relationship with the EU to be considered from the outset, but Barnier said this would only happen once the European Council decided "sufficient progress has been made" on the other issues.
Davis - who had predicted this would be the "row of the summer" - denied suggestions the agreed timetable showed Britain's "weakness" and insisted it was "completely consistent" with the government's aim of parallel trade and exit talks.
"It's not when it starts it's how it finishes that matters," he said.
Asked whether he had made any concessions to the UK in return, Barnier said the UK had decided to leave the EU - not the other way around, and each side had to "assume our responsibility and the consequences of our decisions".
"I am not in a frame of mind to make concessions, or ask for concessions," he said.
"It's not about punishment, it is not about revenge. "Basically, we are implementing the decision taken by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, and unravel 43 years of patiently-built relations.
"I will do all I can to put emotion to one side and stick to the facts, the figures, and the legal basis, and work with the United Kingdom to find an agreement in that frame of mind." (BBC)

Senior political party members, including President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe of the two main parties decided to hold the Local Government Election soon at a meeting held on Monday, Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
The minister made this observation in Parliament yesterday in response to a query made by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena on the delay of the Local Government Election.
Minister Kiriella said the government wants to hold the election without delay.
Dengue death rate down though number of patients up: Rajitha
The World Health Organisation appreciates Sri Lanka for reducing the dengue death ratio to 0.3 percent which is the lowest rate in the region, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senarathne said.
He said the dengue ratio was one percent earlier. The death rate was reduced although the number of the patients has been increased. He said although dengue has been spreading due to the weather change, the government has taken measures to reduce the death rate. In 2009, there was a similar climate pattern. There had been 304 deaths. One of every 100 infected died then, he said.
Minister Senarathne made these observations yesterday in response to a special statement by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader and MEP leader Dinesh Gunawardena under standing orders 23 (2).
The minister said he was not aware that he had to respond to a question of the Opposition.
I had answered to a similar question by Dinesh Gunawardena earlier. He is questioning again. However, I was at a meeting with officials and chief ministers of provinces where the disease is prevalent when I was informed of this situation. I have to attend the meeting again, he said.
The minister said President Maithripala Sirisena instructed officials to take maximum action to solve the critical situation.
We are planning to shift some patients from Colombo hospitals to hospitals in peripheries so that the problem of space could be solved, Minister Senaratne said. We have taken action to increase the number of beds in hospitals, he said.
The minister said a special training is provided for doctors and nurses to treat dengue patients. Two batches are to be passed out after completion of the course. He said the government brought down the prices of blood tests and dengue blood test reports done by private laboratories to Rs. 750.
People have been instructed to clear their environs from 9.30 am to 10.30 am to prevent further breeding of mosquitoes, Minister Senaratne said.
Consultant Hasitha Thisera went to Australia find out about the bacteria they had found to control dengue larva. The Australian team had agreed to come to Sri Lanka to introduce the method to Sri Lanka. We would be able to control the dengue with its support, he said.
The minister said the inspection of the houses for mosquito breeding places is conducted by the tri-forces. He said machines for fumigation were imported from Germany. Fifty lorries have been made available to transport the machines.
Harbouring Gnanasara Thera
Minister Wijayedasa Rajapakshe refutes allegations
Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijayedasa Rajapakshe refuted the allegation that he was harbouring Bodu Bala Sena General Secretary Ven. Galaboda Atte Gnanasara Thera, in Parliament yesterday.
Minister Rajapakshe made this observation while making a ministerial statement.
I am saddened by false allegations made by some Muslim extremists, Minister Rajapakshe said.
They said that I am harbouring the Thera, but I have nothing to do with the Thera, he said.
He said the Bodu Bala Sena was engaged in various activities in 2014. Ven. Ganasara Thera should have been arrested after the clashes in Alutgama, he said.
Researchers studying method to eliminate dengue mosquito larva
The Medical Research Institute of Sri Lanka is studying of a special mosquito larva that eats up the dengue mosquito larva, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senarathne said.
The minister said those special mosquito larva could consume dengue mosquito larva when they were introduced. He said the research is in progress.
He made these observations yesterday in response to a special statement made by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader and MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena under the standing orders 23 (2). Responding to Joint Opposition MP Chandrasiri Gajadeera, the minister said there is an indigenous medicine treatment for dengue, which increases the blood count. However, it acts as a treatment to some patients whereas it is not answerable to critical patients, Minister Senaratne said.
However, this medicine has been directed to the Navinna Ayurvedic hospital and would be introduced to the market in future, he said.
UN Special Rapporteurs observations on Judiciary are incorrect: Justice Minister
Justice Minister Wijayedasa Rajapakshe rejecting the report of Mnica Pinto, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Sri Lankan Judiciary and Lawyers, said allegations in the report are incorrect.
Minister Rajapakshe was making a special ministerial statement in Parliament yesterday to express the governments stance on the report released on March 23.
Pinto was in Sri Lanka only for seven days from April 29 to May 7, 2016. If she was to produce this report, she should have got the wisdom of God Shakra. Beyond doubt, this report was compiled not by Pinto, but by certain parasite NGO men who depend on dollars, the minister said.
He said the governments observations on the report were sent to the diplomatic mission of Sri Lanka via the Foreign Ministry to communicate to the United Nations.
The report does not reflect the ground situation. Its content is out-dated. It has distorted facts and damaged the dignity and good name of the country. It affects our sovereignty, he said.
The minister questioned the objectivity in observations made by Pinto in her report.
She has insisted on amending the Prevention of Terrorism Act, but a trend of introducing draconian laws worse than ours is taking place in the world, in the wake of recent brutal terrorist attacks in some western countries that championed human rights and democracy. Japanese Parliament passed the Criminal Conspiracy Law five days ago.
It has identified 277 crimes that incite terrorism and has made provision to arrest anybody found guilty of them. It has made provision to arrest anybody who publishes social media content that endangers national security. Anybody who reacts to such posts with likes can also be arrested. The countries that championed human rights have realised that relaxing terrorism laws does not protect humans, but destroys them, the minister said.
Pinto in her report said suspects should be given access to a lawyer immediately after the arrest. The UK has the provision to delay legal access for criminals involved in serious crimes for 36 hours. Why doesnt she make the same recommendation to the UK Rajapakshe questioned.
The minister slammed the UN stating that it did not support to prevent or ease the conflict when the war was ravaging in the country. However, we are glad that former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon when he was retiring from his post owned up this fault, he said.
The minister said Pinto, who raised concerns on the appointment of Supreme Court Judges by the President subject to the approval of the Constitutional Council (CC), does not make the same observation on the US system where a similar procedure is followed. The US President appoints the Supreme Court Judges upon the approval of the Senate, he said.
Pinto criticises the fact that the majority of members in the CC are political representatives. However, the report does not state the fact that our original proposal was to appoint more civil society representatives to the CC, but that it had to be amended at the request of public representatives. Our laws are framed taking into account the welfare and aspirations of the people, not as of the desires of a foreign nation or institution. Though the majority in the CC are politicians, its conduct did not give rise to any controversy, the minister said.
Minister Rajapakshe, commenting on Pintos observations on the Attorney Generals Department, said those were not fair.
Pinto took 10 and a half months to submit the report following her visit to Sri Lanka. We have taken steps to minimise the delay of court cases. Those have not been included in the report, he said.
Lacuna in Finance Ministry annual report: Anura Kumara
The annual report of the Finance Ministry for 2016 is incomplete without the Auditor General (AG)s opinion, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in Parliament yesterday.
Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake presented the annual report to Parliament on behalf of the subject minister at the commencement of the sittings.
MP Dissanayake said Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe has mentioned in the report that he refrained from making an audit statement as he was not provided details required for audit purposes.
As this is an incomplete report, Parliament should reject it and send it back to the ministry to include the AGs opinion, the MP said.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said if a ministry did not furnish required information, the AG should have informed Parliament about it. The main fault lies with the AG. The report became incomplete because of him, he said.
However, MP Dissanayake objecting to Kiriella said it was wrong to accuse the AG, adding that the government should not expect the AG to give his nod without scrutiny to a document sent to him.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said he would refer the report to the Public Finance Committee to take a decision, adding that he does not wish to comment as to who is right and who is wrong.
Opposition seeks immediate response from govt to curb dengue
Opposition MPs yesterday in Parliament demanded immediate response from the government on measures taken to curb the dengue epidemic in the country. Mahajana Eksath Peramuna Leader Dinesh Gunawardena raising a question under the Standing Order 23 (2) called for the setting up of a Standing Committee in Parliament to propose immediate action to control the dengue epidemic and accelerate relief measures to the people affected by recent natural disasters.
The government should pay attention to the people affected by the prolonged dry spell in the North and East, Rajarata and several areas in the Kurunegala district. It should put in place a programme to provide relief promised by the government to flood and landslide affected people. The government should intervene to control the dengue epidemic as it has claimed over 200 lives, while the number of dengue patients have exceeded 65,000, he said.
Hospitals are overflowing with dengue patients. The situation is bad. The government does not pay heed to the opinions of doctors and professionals, he said.
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the IDH has halted admitting patients, while Ragama and Jayewardenapura hospitals were also overflowing with patients.
Twenty five percent of dengue patients are schoolchildren. The Health Minister should have briefed the House on the situation. Instead, he had told a newspaper that the dengue spread was a result of development. For him, dengue is a criterion to gauge development, MP Dissanayake said.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would reply to the question next day.
Minister Daya Gamage brought the attention of the House that President Maithripala Sirisena was chairing a special meeting on dengue with relevant officials. We have done everything in our capacity to curb dengue. Do not resort to take political mileage out of the issue. The contribution of all is needed to control dengue, he said.
MP Dissanayake questioned why the President waited until the situation goes out of control to convene a meeting. It was too late now. Was the government sleeping he asked.
Twenty seven Joint Opposition MPs stood up from their seats and protested at that stage.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had to suspend the sittings and convene a Party Leaders Meeting to discuss the situation. As the House resumed after about 20 minutes, the Speaker announced that Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne would come to Parliament after the meeting with the President and brief the House on the situation.
The Speaker had to suspend the sittings again around 2.35 pm until the arrival of Minister Senaratne to make his reply before the commencement of the debate scheduled for yesterday.

Poddala Jayantha makes fresh plaint to CID
Journalist Poddala Jayantha who was abducted and tortured during the previous regime in 2009, lodged a complaint with the CID yesterday.
He requested a full scale investigation into the degrading and inhumane treatment meted out to him by past rulers.
Speaking to the media after handing over his complaint Poddala Jayantha said there seemed to be a certain extent of democracy existing in the country today after the January 8, 2015 change effected by people who aspired for a change.This positive change for the better should never be underestimated, Jayantha said.
Jayantha was accompanied to the CID by representatives of the Sri Lanka Working Journalists Association, several other journalists organisations and a group of social activists. Jayantha who was also a former President of the SLWJA was abducted on June 1, 2009 by group of armed men in a white van. As he remained with his a limbs broken he was hospitalised. Later he left for New York USA in December 2010.
Jayantha said 8 years had passed since his abduction but no investigation had been made so far into the cruelty meted out to him despite making written complaints to several leading officials including the IGP. This time he decided to make a fresh complaint when he arrived in Sri Lanka to see his elderly parents.He said although the CID accepted his complaint they said they could not start any investigation without an order from the IGP.
However he handed over the complaint to the CID Director and expects him to forward it to the IGP and receive his order.Jayantha said suspects involved in the Keith Noyahr abduction have already been arrested and he suspected them to be involved in his conduction too.

Proper waste management to decrease dengue

Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine Rajitha Senaratne today warned that dengue numbers could worsen in future if proper waste management is not implemented.
Cabinet this week approved a proposal put forward by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, to; have disposal of waste at recognized lands under environmental laws; take judicial action to prevent public protests on waste disposal; to have waste disposed only after grading; provide necessary tools to local government authorities; and increase awareness of the general public with regard to waste.
Addressing the weekly cabinet briefing the minister stressed that the government was working to control the garbage issue and denied reports that local government was not performing its basic duties since they were dissolved two years ago.
In 2009, we had one of the worst outbreaks where number of deaths was 1000:1 but in 2015 we had the lowest numbers and there were no local government members, he said.
When we had local government members, they did not pay much attention to this. It is true that if there are one or two good members, it would be easier as there are only officials now but statistically you cannot say local government members control the situation better, Minister Senaratne said.
Dengue will worsen as flood waters recede further. This happened last year too, added the Minister.

Protect religious freedom,religious harmony:National Christian Council
The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka (NCCSL), which represents the majority of non-Roman Catholic churches in Sri Lanka, is disturbed by some of the views expressed over the past few days in relation to the violence, intimidation and the threat posed against Christian churches in the country.
The National Christian Council in a release states We reiterate the fact that Christian churches have been subject to violence, intimidation and threats over the past few years. This is in addition to the many ongoing issues that the Christian community faces with regard to the construction of places of worship, the registration of churches, house churches, Christian education in state schools and the forced closure of churches etc. which successive governments have failed to address despite us having made clear representations to the relevant authorities.
We are of the opinion that the current crisis, which has been precipitated through TV debates and pronouncements of politicians, is only trying to deal with the visible wounds and symptoms of a problem without trying to address the root causes.
We recognise that many of the problems we face are precipitated by the actions of a small number of extremist elements within each religion. The Council has been involved, over very many years in, formal and informal, consultations and conversations with Religious leaders from all faiths and with a variety forums within the Christian community. We are confident that honest and frank dialogue sustained by a sincere commitment from the Religious Leaders of all faiths can reduce the tension without further damaging the Interfaith cordiality and harmony that has existed in this country.
We once again stress, to all those in positions of authority, that it is of paramount importance that law and order should be enforced by the police without bias and fear.
No individuals or groups should be allowed to take the law into their own hands and must be prevented from inappropriately using religious sentiments for personal or political ends. Only last week we issued a statement that was clear in both of these principles.
We appeal to the government to take immediate steps to seek to resolve the underlying problems faced by religious minorities on this island and appeal to the Religious Leaders to come together to collectively address the crucial underlying issues, so that religious freedom for all religious communities is upheld in law and that the right of
every individual to proclaim his or her own religion, and to contribute to public life,without being subjected to attack or ridicule, is respected and protected, the release adds.
The NCCSL also represents the following Ecumenical Organizations: Young Mens Christian Association (YMCA),Young Womens Christian Association (YWCA),Student Christian Movement (SCM),The Ceylon Bible Society,Christian Literature Society, Theological College of Lanka, Back to the Bible Broadcast,Colombo Theological Seminary and Youth for Christ.

Though Sri Lankans enjoy a higher literacy, they face difficulties in day today life since they lack knowledge of the law of the country, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
He was addressing the participants at the first meeting of a legal assistance programme launched with the active participation of the Legal Aid Commission of Sri Lanka and the Human Rights Activity to provide legal aids, counselling and advice to less privileged community in the Colombo district recently at the Paramadharmodaya Viharala, Wellampitiya.
The programme was initiated by the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government in keeping with a concept of Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
As a politician it is more important to take all possible action to address this issue, so that the community can take required steps to solve their issues close to their daily life, beside taking necessary steps to address development issues. Each citizen has a right to know and understand his/her fundamental rights, but prevailing socio-cultural environment has effectively shut the doors for them to ensure access for them, addressing the participants the Minister said.

Railway Unions oppose privatisation moves
Railway Trade Union Alliance (RTUA) yesterday accused the Government that preliminary measures are being taken by the Government to privatize the Railway Department.
RTUA Co-convener, S.P Withanage threatened the Government of tough trade union action unless the Government withdraws the decision of privatising.
Addressing media yesterday at their trade union office at Maradana he said that the Governments intension is to privatize the Railway Department when considering the decisions taken by Railway Department heads.
He said under the privatization move, a private company has been formed named the Railway Museum Guarantee Limited.The company hopes to establish a Railway Museum utilising Rs 300 million of the Railway Department.
The Railway Department received this money as a loan from the Peoples Bank and Peoples Leasing.
Withanage urged Government to provide facilities to make train compartments at the Ratmalana Railway Workshop utilising this Rs 300 million rather than establishing a museum, which cannot be considered as a must at the moment.
We have requested the Transport and Civil Aviation Minister to provide facilities to make and repair train compartments as the repair work is done by the private sector now, he said. He expressed his suspicion that resources including 13,000 acres of lands of the Railway Department are going to be misused through the established private company.
Another company, which operates the Viceroy Special Train should pay Rs 35.4 million to the Railway Department. But the Railway authorities have failed to take any action to claim the money, he said.
Asked whether the RTUA supports the scheduled token strike of the Railway Guards and Drivers, he said that the RTUA accepts all six demands of them except the sixth.
The RTUA is against the sixth demand and we cant accept it as we believe that not only drivers but also the assistant driver need to undergo a special training. It is better to give that special training to guards also, he said.

Saudi king's son Mohammed bin Salman is new crown prince

Saudi Arabia's king has appointed his son Mohammed bin Salman as crown prince - replacing his nephew, Mohammed bin Nayef, as first in line to the throne.
King Salman's decree also means Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 31, will become deputy prime minister while continuing as defence minister.
Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, 57, has been removed from his role as head of domestic security, state media say.
He has pledged allegiance to the new crown prince, news agency SPA reports.
Why is this significant
Saudi Arabia has typically been ruled by kings in their 70s or 80s.
Prince Mohammed bin Salman's rapid ascent is seen by the younger generation as a sign that things are changing.
Before his latest promotion, he was responsible for leading Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, overseeing the kingdom's energy policy and economic reform.
He must have already ruffled a lot of feathers in a royal family that was used to being presided over by a succession of elderly men, the BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen reports.
His father King Salman is 81 and reportedly not in the best of health, our correspondent adds.
Prince Mohammed bin Salman could end up leading Saudi Arabia for decades.
The rise of Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been meteoric.
When I met him in Jeddah in 2013 he described himself as simply "a lawyer". Today he is a heartbeat away from ruling the most powerful country in the Arab world.
Despite being the driving force behind Saudi Arabia's damaging and inconclusive military campaign in Yemen, he is largely popular at home, especially with younger Saudis.
He has swept away many of the ineffective timeservers in government offices and replaced them with young, Western educated technocrats. He has set out a possibly over-ambitious development plan, "Vision 2030", and announced plans to sell off part of the vast state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco.
He has also forged ties with Washington and the Trump administration.
But his biggest and most risky move may yet prove to be his bid to curb the power of the conservative religious establishment. Washington likes this move, but others closer to home do not.
How does Saudi Arabia's royal succession work
The founder of Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz (known as Ibn Saud), had dozens of sons, and there are as many as 15,000 princes and princesses in the royal family.
In 2006, a decree was passed setting up a committee responsible for electing the king and crown prince. The committee is made up of senior princes of the Al Saud royal family and is known as the Allegiance Council.
Mohammed bin Salman's new promotion to crown prince was approved by 31 out of 34 members of the council.
Analysts say those in power tend to appoint their sons to roles that will enhance their chances of being promoted - so when monarchs and crown princes change, sons can come into and out of favour.
King Salman acceded to the throne in January 2015 after the death of his half-brother Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz.
He launched his first major cabinet reshuffle a few months later, promoting Mohammed bin Nayef to crown prince and Mohammed bin Salman, who was relatively unknown at that time, to deputy crown prince.
Experts say the second reshuffle has reduced uncertainty over the line of succession, and means the king has averted a potential power struggle between his son and his nephew.
Who is Prince Mohammed bin Nayef
Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was the kingdom's security chief for many years and was known for his strong stance against jihadist militants.
As deputy prime minister and interior minister, he headed up the counter-terrorism portfolio, and also had good relations with Saudi Arabia's Western allies.
State media broadcast footage showing Mohammed bin Nayef meeting Mohammed bin Salman after the succession was announced.
The former crown prince said "I am content" and "I am going to rest now. May God help you", while the new heir replied "May God help you. I will never do without your advice".

Those rejected by people playing the racist card: Range Bandara
Irrigation State Minister Palitha Range Bandara said yesterday the very forces who were rejected by the people and who spread communalism are now trying to pin the racist card on this government.
During the Rajapaksa regime,it was very evident how the government had tried to cover up its sins by using these racists as puppets. It was openly sponsoring racism by allegedly pumping money for racist activities. The BBS was backed by the former Defence Secretary,alleged Range Bandara.
State Engineering Cooperation funds had been allegedly misused to pay the hiring charges, fuel charges and drivers salary for the vehicle used by an extremist group Rawana Balaya called the organisation.
We lost a number of lives and properties during the Sinhala-Muslim riots and a 30-year war in the North. Everybody remembers how the entire country plunged into an utter chaos due to these struggles.
Therefore,certain people are still trying to create chaos and anarchy again by creating racism due to due to greed for wealth and power. Former Minister Wimal Weerawansa who was arrested for the allegedly misuse of 40 government vehicles causing a loss of about Rs.90 million has accused the government of inciting racism, Range Bandara said.
He always blame the government when he was leaving the Courts premises after appearing for his case.
Range Bandara said that Weerawansa accuses the government of trying to create division among the people in order to gain the support of the Diaspora for the Constitutional Reforms.
This is an utter lie and it is the Opposition that has been demanding for a new Constitution, Range Bandara said.
Today, the Constitutional Reforms are in the progress with the active support of all political parties in Parliament, where all communities represented, he said.
Weerawansa has accuesd the government of providing a safe house to hide Ven. Gunasara Thera. If he knows all this information, why does he not bring this to the notice of the relevant law enforcement authorities.If not, it is a violation of the law.
UNP Parliamentarian Mujibur Rahman said it was during former President Mahinda Rajapaksas era that Sri Lanka has seen an alleged rise in numerous racist and extremist movements. Details have emerged of how former Housing and Construction Minister Wimal Weerawansa had allegedly provided three vehicles to Convener of the Ravana Balaya Ven. Iththekande Saddhatissa Thera and allegedly misused State Engineering Corporation funds to pay the hiring charges for them.
This is how he has allegedly acted in promoting racism powers,Rahman said.
A reason for the previous government to be defeated was due to the hate motivated incidents of terror and violence. That is why we wanted this government to take measures to prevent such incidents, and also to penalise those who disrupt law and order, Rahman said.
The Police have already arrested 14 people in this regard. Today,the government is moving towards reconciliation, rehabilitation and peaceful co-existence. At this juncture, it is clear that several elements are trying to sabotage the governments work by create peaceful co-existence,he added.

The two ministers of the Northern Provincial Council (NPC), found guilty by a three-member committee which investigated corruption allegations made against them had tendered their resignation.
Education Minister Thambyrajah Gurukularajah tendered his resignation yesterday, while Agriculture Minister Ponnuthurai Ayngaranesan had reportedly handed over his resignation to the Chief Ministers office earlier.
However, as the Chief Minister was absent and council member M.K.Sivajilingam had accepted the letters and had handed them over to the Northern Governors Secretary, political sources from Jaffna said.
Earlier, Northern Provincial Council (NPC) Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran called for the resignation of the two Provincial Ministers over corruption and fraud allegations after the committee appointed by him had found them guilty.
The Chief Minister made this request when the NPC took up a debate on the report submitted by three-member committee, which investigated corruption allegations made against NPC ministers.
The Committee appointed by the Chief Minister last year comprised of two retired judges and one retired GA. The committee found evidence on the charges made against the above-mentioned two Provincial Ministers.
The Chief Minister also requested Provincial Health Minister Dr.P.Sathyalingm and Civil Transport and Fisheries Minister B.Denishwaran to go on leave until the corruption and fraud charges against them are properly investigated.
Earlier,NPC Ministers Kurukularaja and Ingaranesan pleaded not guilty when they were given time to show cause with regard to the allegations.
However,some members of the NCP were against Wigneswarans decision to send on leave the health minister and the transport minister who were not found guilty by the committee. Later,16 members had handed over a No Confidence Motion against the Chief Minister to the Governor which resulted in public protests both against Wigeswaran and in support of him.
On Monday,Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader R.Sampanthan had told the group of Northern Provincial Council (NPC) members to withdraw the No-Confidence Motion submitted against Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran.

US rebukes Saudi Arabia over Qatar embargo in reversal after Trump comments
Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state.
The US state department has issued a stinging rebuke toSaudi Arabiaand its Gulf allies saying they had failed to come up with a justification forthe embargo they imposed on Qatar earlier this month.
The public and blunt criticism of Riyadh and the United Arab Emirates marked a sharp about-turn fromDonald Trumps wholehearted backing for the embargo, and his accusations of terrorist funding against Qatar. It follows a increasing pattern in which the state and defence departments have pursued policies abroad that are far removed from Trumps rhetoric.
Now that it has been more than two weeks since the embargo started, we are mystified that the Gulf states have not released to the Qataris, nor to the public, the details about the claims they are making toward Qatar, Heather Nauert,the state department spokeswoman said.
The more that time goes by, the more doubt is raised about the actions taken bySaudi Arabiaand the UAE, she added.
At this point, we are left with one simple question: Were the actions really about their concerns regarding Qatars alleged support for terrorism Or were they about the long-simmering grievances between and among the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] countries
Trump was feted by Saudi Arabia when he made Riyadh the destination ofhis first trip abroadas president, on 20 May. Riyadh declared its embargo on Qatar just over two weeks later and Trump made repeated statements in support of the move, appearing to take at face value Riyadhs justification that it was to punish Doha for its backing of terrorist groups.
In a tweet on June 6, Trumpeven appeared to claim credit for the blockade, suggesting it showed that his trip to Riyadh was paying off
The nation ofQatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level, Trump said in the Rose Garden three days later. We have to stop the funding of terrorism.
But last week, the defence secretary, James Mattis, signed an arms deal in whichthe US sold Qatar 36 F-15 fighter planes, worth $12bn.
In her remarks on Tuesday, Nauert denied that the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, was taking a position that entirely contradicted the initial stance adopted by Trump.
I dont think so at all. I think the president and the secretary both want to see this resolved. They want results, and lets see this resolved quickly, Nauert said. She added that Tillerson no longer saw any need to act as a mediator in the Qatar dispute.
Nauert said Tillerson had spent the two weeks since the embargo talking to the protagonists and regional leaders in person and on the phone, but no longer saw any point in continuing mediation.
The president had offered secretary Tillerson weeks ago to do that. At this point, we dont think that is necessary. We believe through the secretarys talks, through talking with those nations and hearing what they have to say, that theyll be able to work this out on their own, Nauert said.
She added: There comes a certain point where you say, folks, lets get this done, lets get moving along. The secretary likes results.
Days before the embargo was declared,the Qatari state news agency was hacked and a report planted that quoted the emir as casting doubt on how long Trump would last in office, advocating closer ties with Iran and supporting Hamas. The report on 23 May was one of the pretexts for the punitive measures imposed on Qatar. Egypt and Bahrain also cut ties with Gulf nation.
On Tuesday, Qatars attorney general claimed that the hack had come from the countries imposing the embargo.
Qatar has evidence that certain iPhones originating from countries laying siege to Qatar were used in the hack, Ali Bin Fetais al-Marri told reporters in Doha.
He did not name the countries, but an FBI investigation is reported to have pointed towards Russianhackers hired by Gulf clients.
The Gulf dispute is just one of several issues on which the state and defence departments appear to follow a different tack from the president. The divergence is particularly evident in matters connected to Russia. Tillerson and Mattis, supported by most congressional Republicans, have insisted sanctions on Russia for its military intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, remain in place until the Kremlin withdraws its forces. Trump has quietly sought to have the sanctions lifted.

Water Transportation Project underway to mitigate traffic congestion: Patali
Moves are under way by the Megapolis Ministry to put to use inland waterways in the Western Province for passenger transportation in a bid to reduce road traffic congestions, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said. The ministry is set to introduce commercial water transportation systems for waterways in Wellawatta, Kelaniya and Colombo in keeping with the Megapolis Ministrys Water-based Transportation Project, the minister said.
Commercial boat passenger transportation services will be introuced to ferry commuters from Battaramulla to Wellawatta, Fort to Union Place and Mattakkuliya to Hanwella as part of the project. Wellawatta, Kelamiya and Colombo canals will be used, a Megapolis Ministry officials said. The Megapolis Ministrys Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) is carrying out the water transportation projects as per instructions of Minister Ranawaka.
SLLRDC Chairman Asela Iddawala said they are currently carrying out feasibility studies to introduce water transportation services.one of them is to run a boat passenger service between Thotalanga and Negombo, he said.
He said SLLRDC has contracted Sri Lanka Navy to construct a jetty at Diyatha Unyana to start a public boat service providing water transportation from Battaramulla to Wellawatta.
This will be their Water-based Transportation Projects first commuter transportation service.It will take a month or two to complete the project.
We have already called tenders from boat operators. The service will be run through a public- private partnership, he explained.
We will need passenger boats that can accommodate more than 20 people and we want facilities to guarantee passenger safety. These are looked into, he said.
Also, he said , We are taking steps to set up car parks for those using water transportation services. This is to enable them to park their vehicles and to get on boats so that they can go to their desired destinations from that point using water transportation. It takes about two hours to travel from Battaramulla to Wellawattata by bus. But through the waterway it takes just 40 minutes. It saves time.It will have a considerable impact on the countrys economy and development, he said.

Workshop to improve SL SME export capacity
International Trade Centre (ITC), a joint agency of the UN and the World Trade Organization (WTO), yesterday launched a three day technical assistance training workshop titled EU-Sri Lanka Trade-Related Assistance: Increasing SMEs Trade Competitiveness in Regional and EU markets at the Galle Face Hotel.
The workshop is part of an 8 million euro EU-funded project to improve Sri Lankas SME export capacity that will run until October 31, 2020.
This venture will contribute to Sri Lankas inclusive trade-led growth and regional integration, which will in turn contribute to poverty alleviation. It will also increase the trade competitiveness of Sri Lankan SMEs, ITC National Project Coordinator Dayaratna Silva said.
The ITC hopes that the project will help form a coherent trade strategy for increasing export competitiveness that will include policy and regulatory reforms and enhanced trade negotiations as shaped by the WTO.
Silva said the plan will lead to greater efficiency with regard to cross-border trade procedures that will facilitate exporting to SAARC countries and the EU.
The project will help boost SMEs competitiveness in export-oriented sectors such as food, spices, and information technology outsourcing (ITO) and business processing outsourcing (BPO).
