United Motors invests Rs 100 mn on JCB facility in Peliyagoda
United Motors Lanka (UML) has invested Rs 100 million in the first phase of the state of the art machinery and service facility in a 1.5 acre land in Peliyagoda.
This is to promote the world famous brand JCB. At the launch UML Group CEO and Executive Director, Chanaka Yatawara said that construction is an exciting and growing industry in Sri Lanka and UML wanted to explore the opportunities and invested there by collaborating with the JCB, heavy equipment brand.
Yatawara said that almost 9 per cent of the GDP had come from the construction sector last year and Rs 200 billion has been added to the GDP by the construction sector in 2017. Some 700,000 persons were employed directly and otherwise in construction related employment which is about 8 percent of the working population in the country, he said.
Yatawara noted that over 1,200 machines used for constriction are imported every year and the market has grown 30 percent from 2016 to 2017. There could be a large market for material handling application and there is a big opportunity to be a player in the excavator space, he pointed out.
Sale of JCB product range, mechanical repairs, painting, welding, servicing and maintenance will be done at the new facility in Peliyagoda. UML will also use JCB Livelink, a technology developed by JCB to monitor the performance of all its machinery. The technology will identify and alert JCB users of issues or a decrease in efficiency of the machine and will provide details for servicing and product support.
A highly skilled team of UML technicians to facilitate the JCB Livelink technology has been deployed by UML, he added.

VAT on private hospitals removed from next week - Mangala
The Value Added Tax (VAT) charged from private sector hospitals will be removed from next week, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The VAT charged on consultancy fees and other private hospital bills would be exempt from VAT from next week the Minister said.
Minister Samaraweera was speaking at the Matara Divisional Secretariat on Saturday to hand over the final installment of compensation to those who suffered loss due to the May 2017 floods.
He also handed over deeds to alternate lands provided to persons displaced by the 2004 tsunami.
The Minister said this is a part of the ongoing programmes of the Good Governance government to provide relief to the people and ensure their welfare.
Minister Samaraweera said despite the huge debt inherited from the previous regime, this government did not neglect the welfare of the people and our main goal is to provide relief without playing party politics.
In addition to providing free health services and medication at government hospitals, the government reduced the prices of essential drugs, provides stents free of charge to heart patients and lenses to eye patients. We intend to provide further relief by exempting private hospitals from VAT from next week, the Minister reiterated.
The minister said that every person resident in the Matara district who suffered loss due to the floods of May/June 2017 has been compensated by the government irrespective of their caste, ethnicity, religion or political affiliation.
Over 200,000 persons in the Matara district were displaced due to floods in May last year. The National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF) assessed the damage and loss incurred by 5,137 persons at Rs.1,598 million. Of the 5,137 affected people, the houses of 101 persons were completely destroyed by the floods, he said.
Each claim was carefully assessed before compensation was paid. In earlier years, every person affected by natural disasters were paid Rs.25,000 each and those whose homes were totally destroyed were paid only Rs.100,000. Furthermore, Government servants did not qualify to receive compensation under the above schemes. I have been told that some of you have received as much as Rs.1.7 million, Minister Samaraweera said.
Provincial Minister for Education, Land and Highways and SLFPs organiser for the Matara District Chandima Rasaputhra said that the people of Matara should not miss out on this golden opportunity at a time when a Member of Parliament representing the Matara district holds the portfolio of Finance.
We should make best use of this golden opportunity and forget about our political affiliations by working together to bring as much development to Matara, he said.
District Secretary Pradeep Rathnayaka and Divisional Secretary Darshana Wickremarachchi also spoke at the event.

GROS ISLET, Saint Lucia, Saturday: Australian batsman David Warner will play for the St Lucia Stars in the Caribbean Premier League as he continues his attempt to rebuild his reputation after the ball-tampering scandal.
The 31-year-old was handed a one-year ban from international and state cricket by Cricket Australia for his role in helping to devise a plan to rub sandpaper on the ball during a Test match against South Africa in March.
Warner has already agreed deals to play in lower-level Australian grade cricket and at a tournament in Canada in July.
The CPL announced on Saturday that the swashbuckling opener would replace his compatriot D'Arcy Short in the St Lucia side for their T20 event which runs from August 8 until September 16.
"We are excited to bring David to the Saint Lucia Stars," said Stars general manager Mohammad Khan.
"David is arguably one of the greatest batsmen of the modern era and a winning player. He is going to add a lot of value on the field and in the dressing room as we pursue our first CPL title."

Mexican company faces ire for sexist lingerie ad
Womans underwear vibrates after goals at Fifa World Cup
A Mexican underwear retailer has been facing severe backlash after they took to Twitter to advertise about lingerie that vibrates when footballers score.
According to Vicky Form, it is a bid to get more women into the World Cup. However, several people have called it extremely sexist. The advertisement also feeds to the popular discriminatory idea that women do not like sports and get angry when their male partner enjoys one.
While one social media user wrote, This is pitiful advertising. Clearly being able to understand or like sport does not depend on gender. Moreover, it sexualises the woman it presents. Advertising with backward ideas, another person writes: I have female friends who really like football and watch it for fun with their boyfriends.
The clip begins describing the problem a couple is facing  The man enjoys World Cup and this makes his girlfriend feel that he is not giving her enough attention.
He turns on the TV and nobody else exists. Whats wrong with him Because of football the woman is seen complaining.
Then the female narrator adds: Vicky Form have found the solution so that both of them get equally excited. We have created the first pair of knickers that let you feel the passion of the match. The undies are linked to a robot that interprets the action and transforms it into vibrations in real time.
The next scene changes to the couple watching the match with the woman wearing the underwear. As the match gets more exciting, she gets more stimulated. At one point she gets angry after her vibrator stopped as it was a foul.

Yoga connection!
A deaf and blind man has found a unique way of connecting with his hearing wife  through yoga. 31-year-old Andrew Cohen has Usher syndrome, a rare genetic disorder which means he is visually impaired, profoundly deaf and has balance issues.
Despite that, the software technician and his wife Kelly Brittingham, 30, decided to take up acroyoga  a combination of acrobatics and yoga  last year. Most people new to the practice  which relies heavily on flexibility, strength and technique  communicate verbally, but in Andrew and Kellys case that isnt an option.
Normally, the couple talks using sign language, but with acroyoga that isnt an option either because they need to use their hands. As a result, they must rely on touch to ensure they have exactly the right body part in the right place at the right time and have trained themselves to feel the flow. The couple has devoted hundreds of hours to learning and fine-tuning poses in their apartment and their local studio, with Andrew as the base and Kelly as the flyer. At first, Andrew and Kelly would practice for two hours every night, but they later began professional classes and now devote around six hours a week to perfecting their routines.
Kelly, a support service provider living in Round Rock, Texas, USA, said, I think people are surprised when people learn Andrew is deafblind. Theyre like, How are you guys doing that He cant hear or see so everything is based on touch and trust. It all comes down to being able to communicate with each other, not through talking but through movement and feeling the flow. At first, it was hard. For Andrew and I, his balance was one of the biggest challenges. We also had to learn how to communicate without signing and relying on body language. The first move we learned, which is called bird, took us a month. You have to put the feet of the base on the pelvis of the flier and they push you into the air. For most people it takes a couple of hours. It made me nervous. Its difficult when you are with someone who has never done it and is deafblind, but it was exciting when we managed it. We built upon that and little by little have become more advanced. I think its down to working together.
Andrew added, My particular kind of deafblindness causes me to unable to hear at all. I can see the world only through a pinhole. I was also born profoundly deaf. You could put me beside a rock concert and I will sleep through it. Another thing about my deafblindness is I have no balance. I am like a pinball machine. It is a lot of work to balance my wife or others as a flyer. I can detect whether the fulcrum feels good or not. I can adjust to the flyer or the flyer can adjust to me. The simple fact is verbal and visual cues arent needed to communicate to your partner. It is purely tactile. You feel and adapt to each other. It creates another level of empathy and connection between us.
Kelly said that doing yoga with her husband is awesome.
She added, Its great exercise, its fun and its team-building. It has definitely brought us closer together  not only physically, but mentally and emotionally too.

Naive Nigeria youth schooled by Croatia master Modric
KALININGRAD, Russia, Saturday - Nigeria coach Gernot Rohr admitted his young team had been naive in a 2-0 loss to Croatia in their opening Group D game Saturday, continuing a dismal recent record at World Cups.
A Luka Modric penalty 20 minutes from time and a first-half own goal sealed victory for a Croatia side brimming with technical ability, and the Super Eagles -- who brought the youngest squad to Russia -- have now won just one of their last 13 games on footballs biggest stage.
We are disappointed but we must recognise Croatia were better tonight and my young players made some mistakes, Rohr told reporters after the game in Russias European exclave of Kaliningrad.
With rivals Argentina and Iceland only managing a 1-1 draw earlier Saturday in Saransk, both sides had a chance to take control of Group D.
Nigeria, knowing they were always likely to struggle for possession against a central one-two of Modric and Ivan Rakitic, were content to sit back and allow Croatia to come to them.
After 10 minutes, Juventus target man Mario Mandzukic teed up Ivan Perisic at the edge of the area only for the Inter Milan forward to blaze over.
Croatia, semi-finalists at France 98, have struggled to live up to the lofty expectations borne of an embarrassment of midfield riches, and meekly lost their World Cup opener 3-1 to hosts Brazil four years ago.
There is a sense of now-or-never for the Balkans nation at this tournament and Modric said his side would lift their game when they meet Lionel Messis Argentina in their next match.
Its going to be a very difficult match. They have huge amounts of quality, but this win will really boost our confidence and we are going to up our game.
The last time Croatia won their opening group game was back in 1998, and coach Zlatko Dalic said he was glad the squad had put that unfortunate record behind them.
We were disciplined and we deserved the win. We fought for this, he told reporters. heading into Russia was a little over 25 years old and at times the experience gap showed.
Rohr kept faith in 19-year-old keeper Francis Uzoho but the Deportivo stoppers first real action was picking the ball out of the net.
Just after the half-hour mark, Mandzukic, industrious in his hold-up play, chested a Andrej Kramaric cross back to Ante Rebic, whose fizzing shot was blocked. The resulting corner saw Rebic return the favour with a near-post flick on met by a diving Mandzukic.
Oghenekaro Etebo, up until that point one of Nigerias best performers, was wrong-footed and bundled into his own net.
ALL IN OUR HANDS
Nigeria responded well, with Arsenal forward Alex Iwobis shot from a cleared free kick blocked on 45 minutes and his Premier League colleague Victor Moses shooting wide from 30 yards on the stroke of half time.
They had the best of the start of the second period, forcing Croatia to bat away three corners in succession, before Moses again snatched a shot wide of Danjiel Subasics left upright.
But just as Nigeria showed some signs of life, in the 71st minute William Ekong held down Mandzukic from a cross in the area and referee Sandro Ricci immediately pointed to the spot. Modrics gilded right foot guided it to Uzohos right side.
We didnt concede a goal from open play, only from set pieces so this is not a question of tactics, Rohr said.
Sometimes we were a little bit naive on set pieces but we will work on it.
Nigeria play Iceland on June 22 in Volgograd and Rohr insisted his team could still make it out of what is a highly competitive group.
We are only one point behind (Iceland) and all is in our hands so lets be positive. Let them learn from this defeat and try to do better, said the former Bordeaux coach. Despite fears pre-match, there was no reports of any racist chanting from among the near-capacity crowd in Kaliningrad. - AFP

No point crying over spilt milk - beaten Peru focus on France
SARANSK, Russia, Saturday: Coach Ricardo Gareca says Peru must recover quickly from losing their first game at a World Cup finals for 36 years to bounce back against France and keep their Russia 2018 hopes alive.
Kasper Schmeichels acrobatic saves for Denmark and Yussuf Poulsens clinically taken second-half goal ended Perus 15-match unbeaten run in a 1-0 defeat in Saransk.
Despite near-deafening support from their huge army of travelling fans at the Mordovia Arena on Saturday, Peru drew a blank in their Group C opener.
Midfielder Christian Cueva blasted his penalty attempt over the crossbar, after the video assistant referee spotted Poulsens foul on him just before half-time.
And Paolo Guerrero, who won a late reprieve to play in Russia after his drugs ban was over-turned, went close with a string of chances after coming on for the final 30 minutes.
The result doesnt really reflect what happened on the pitch, but football is all about being effective, said Perus Argentinian boss Gareca.
We had an enormous amount of fans and it was sad they came so far to see us lose, they deserved at least a draw.
We didnt deserve to lose, but we cant cry over spilt milk.
After losing their first match at a World Cup finals since 1982, Peru need a good result against France at Ekaterinberg next Thursday before facing Australia on June 26 in Sochi.
Losing the first game doesnt mean we are out, said Gareca.
We need to see where we can correct our mistakes to face France in the best possible manner.
Despite his drugs ban, Gareca said Guerrero was fast and up to the pace of everyone else, which is crucial, and hinted the 34-year-old might start against France.
Its sad, because the team played a great game, we had many chances and unfortunately we couldnt convert them, said Guerrero.  AFP

The month of Ramazan is thrice blessed. This month in which the Holy Quran was revealed to Prophet Sal to guide humankind to the abode of felicity, is a month of mercy, forgiveness and deliverance.
May this Eid-ul-Fitr be a means for the Muslim community to continue to live in harmony with each other as well as all other communities. Let there be peace and serenity in our motherland. President Maithripala Sirisena too, has contributed to achieve this.

ABM Exide registers top-line growth of 24%
Sri Lankas premier automobile battery producer Associated Battery Manufacturers (Ceylon) Limited (ABM) has showed a healthy financial performance recoding a turnover of Rs 3.36 billion in the financial year 2017/18, a top- line growth of 24% year on year.
The companys profit before tax (PBT) has also seen a significant increase to Rs 272 million which is a bottom- line growth of 12.5% over 2016/17.
ABM Director, CEO M Ramachandran attributed this encouraging financial performance of ABM Exide to quality and product perception which is clearly highlighted by the low returns and number of failures coming down drastically. Ramachandran said that warrantee replacements have declined to a record low percentage of 2.2 which is very good in the international standard average. The CEO said this year they target to further bring down the warrantee replacement percentage below the 2.2% mark and this will be possible with the improvements carried out in the product and manufacturing process.
ABM has also recorded a 59% growth in battery exports mustering export revenue of US$ 1.33 million in 2017/18 by exporting to Myanmar, Singapore, UAE, Indonesia and the Maldives.
Ramachandran said this year they plan to move into Cambodia and Vietnam. Elaborating on goals for this year the CEO said they aim at a turnover of Rs 4 billion and that will be in track of achieving the 5 billion target as envisaged in his five year plan for the company. He said the company also plans to introduce products for electric and hybrid vehicles and would be moving to Lithium Ion batteries to cater to that segment. For this he said they would be collaborating with a foreign company and have already began negotiations with a fortune 500 Korean company. He said by end of this year they will be ready with a complete proposal.
Ramachandran also disclosed that ABMs latest introduction to the market would be the start stop system Led acid battery which will be introduced this year. This will be done in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology (SLINTEC) where in the laboratory test has been completed and the product test is being carried out now. With the introduction of this cost effective start stop battery the vehicle fuel efficiency will increase by 12 %, he said. The CEO said the two-wheeler battery production which they commenced last year has received a good feedback and over 50,000 motorcycle batteries were sold last year. This year the company plans to manufacture a minimum of 120,000 motor cycle batteries.
A high-speed assembly line with an investment of Rs 80 million has just been installed to strengthen the operations of the company. ABM also won many feats in 2017/18 winning the Runners Up position for the category Manufacturing Engineering Sector at the Business Excellence Awards conducted by the National Chamber of Commerce and also won the Commendation Award at the Taiki Akimoso 5S Competition conducted by Japan Technical and Cultural Association (JASTECA) in March 2018.
Ramachandran added that they would be aiming for greater heights in the 5S field this year.

Afghanistan vow to bounce back from debut Test drubbing
BANGALORE, Saturday: When India captain Ajinkya Rahane invited Afghanistan's players to join his side for a team photo after inflicting the biggest ever defeat on a Test debutant, it was clear that the cricket world was feeling for the new boys.
But Afghanistan, well used to adversity in their lives, have insisted they do not want sympathy despite being thrashed by an innings and 262 runs inside two days in their first five-day Test.
Afghanistan captain Asghar Stanikzai said he was surprised by the margin of defeat but insisted the team with their new glowing red Test caps would "learn lessons" from the loss.
Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) chief executive Shafiqullah Stanikzai told AFP the team would use the defeat as a sign of the work they still have to do.
"We are not taking it on ourselves, there was a lesson to be learned," the board chief said after the loss at Bangalore's M Chinnaswamy Stadium.
"It was a good thing that we faced the world number one Test side in our inaugural match. It has given us a real indicator if we are to become a top cricketing side in the world."
"I had a brief chat with the captain and he knows what needs to be done. We can only go higher and higher from here."
Since gaining one day international status in 2009, the Afghans have qualified for their second 50-over World Cup in England and Wales next year. They have also been part of four Twenty20 World Cups.
Virtually every member of the team has witnessed conflict at close quarters in their home country. Many of them learned their cricket in refugee camps in Pakistan.
'WANT TO SUCCEED'
"The kind of character that our team has shown in the past decade is that we have come back from tough situations and we have worked hard," said the chief executive.
Afghanistan's introduction to the five-day game exposed major weaknesses in a side bundled out twice in a day for 109 and 103 while responding to India's 474. Their bowling was also found wanting with teenage spinners Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman giving away 229 runs between them.
Afghanistan's West Indian coach Phil Simmons defended the star spinners, who had impressed in the Indian Premier League but could not cope with the big day.
"I think in the first part nerves got the better of them, and as they went along they showed what they are capable of," said Simmons.
"But I think they are by no means happy with how they performed," he told reporters. Simmons, who has also coached Zimbabwe and Ireland, said the Afghans can learn from their mistakes.
"I do believe they want to succeed, they want to be good at it and we have to work five times as hard as we did. I believe that they will get there," he said.India captain Rahane encouraged the newcomers to bounce back, saying "they should not be blamed" for the heavy defeat.  AFP

Desigar Ramanujam
He fought for workers' rights
Desigar Ramanujam was born in Ramanathapuram, South India, on July 17, 1907. Upon completing his higher studies, Ramanujam commenced a career in journalism and by the late 1920s, was an accomplished. It was during that time that he joined the editorial staff of the local Tamil Newspaper Desa Bakthan.
In 1943, he became a teacher at Dharmaraja Collage, Kandy. Due to his fluency in English and Tamil, he was summoned by the Kandy courts to translate evidence from Tamil to English. Witnessing the hardships faced by low-income Tamil workers, particularly those working at the Kandy Municipal Council, Ramanujam went on to form an association called the Bose Sangam, in order to safeguard the rights of Indian workers who lived in the Mahiyawa and Asgiriya areas.
During this period, several such trade unions were formed in different parts of the upcountry, to represent Indian workers brought to Sri Lanka by British Plantation Companies to work in estates.
In 1937, Jawaharlal Nehru was sent to Sri Lanka by Mahatma Gandhi, to look into the problems of Indian workers. Leaders such as Rajalingam from Nawalapitiya, Suppiah from Badulla and a few others who were leading their own trade unions, met with Nehru at the time.
It was with Nehrus advice that those leaders decided to dissolve their individual trade unions and form one national trade union to represent Indian workers. Thus, the Ceylon Indian Congress (CIC) was born, which later came to be known as the Ceylon Workers' Congress (CWC). Ramanujam, Rajalingam, Suppiah and few others were the founding member of the CIC.
Ramanujam was elected to the Kandy Municipal Council in 1943, while representing the Asgiriya ward and in 1946, he became the first person of Indian Origin to be elected the Kandy Deputy Mayor. During this period, he was responsible for providing pipe-borne water to the Asgiriya Maha Viharaya. Ramanujam received the blessings of the then Asgiriya Chapter Mahanayaka Thera, who urged residents of the area to support him. Ramanujam served the ward for 13 consecutive years.
He was elected at the first parliamentary election held between August and September, 1947, contesting as an independent candidate to the Aluthnuwara electorate (presently Mahiyangana) and securing 46.6 percent of the total votes; 1,437 votes ahead of his primary rival, while defeating three other candidates as well. He thus became one of the seven CIC members elected to parliament in 1947.
Ramanujam worked tirelessly for the rights of plantation workers as the CWC Joint Secretary. He represented Sri Lanka as the workers' delegate at several annual meetings of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and his contributions to these sessions were always respected as well as appreciated.In 1961, former Prime Minister late Sirimavo Bandaranaike offered Ramanujam a seat in Parliament as he was a friend of late S. W. R. D. Bandaranayake, but he had declined the offer.
In 1962, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), recognising his contributions to the trade union movement as well as his achievements at ILO meetings, invited him to join their organisation, where he was given the task of supervising sugar plantations in Mauritius. He was subsequently transferred to Ethiopia, in order to establish trade unions during the regime of Haile Selassie.
In 1965, the ICFTU appointed Ramanujam as their special representative in Singapore. His task was to persuade the National Trade Union Congress of Singapore to amend its constitution, to become an internationally-accepted trade union. He was then appointed ICFTU South East Asia Regional Director.
In 1968, the ICFTU appointed Ramanujam as the Asian Regional Director, based in India; however, he suddenly passed away on June 4, 1968, before he could commence work.
The international trade union movement lost an honest human being who served workers both local and international.

Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un
Ibrahim, you returned to the permanent abode of Jannathul Firdouse during the Holy month of Rajab, on April 16, this year. What more could one pray for other than to answer the call of their creator Your peaceful end proved your unshakable faith in Allah.
The end justifies the means could not have found a more worthwhile example. You never failed to recite daily prayers and never let inclement weather conditions or health complications impede any of your plans.
When you were warded at a state hospital, you managed to find a convenient place between the bed and the locker to offer your prayers. I was lost for words when I saw you prostrating in that cramped place. Ibrahim, do we need a better situation to support our opinion on the strength of your emaan Your life was based on the intrinsic value: I am what I am. I am not what I am not. This principle guided you right throughout your journey in this uncertain world.
Publicity and pomposity are two things that did not corrupt you during your life. You did not struggle or strive to outdo or outsmart anyone in any given situation. You found little or no time for arrogance and had a strong sense of family. We both shared the same political ideology.
I invariably depended on you for verification and clarification on matters of politics both local and international, aside from religion. I knew for certain that your intellectual experience simply could not be doubted or ignored, as it was based on authenticity. In this day and age, where pseudo-piety is fast-gaining ground, faithfuls of your ilk is a rarity.
The Janaza prayers organised by Representative of Sri Lanka to Palestine Fawzan Anver, which were conducted at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, was in the Almighty Allahs last will that was bequeathed to you unreservedly.
May Allah grant you Eternal Bliss hereafter.

On this Fathers Day,
I can no longer see you
Or sit beside you to listen
Beautiful memories are all that I have
To remind me how precious it can be
To be loved by a dad like you
Daddy, you had it all in store
Thats what made you one in a million
Loads of love, patience and caring
Words of wisdom and words of praise
A guiding light and a pillar of strength
A firm foundation through all stages in life
Skies full of snow, flowers all around
Summers hazy days and autumns falling leaves
Brings back a million memories
A million memories of how it used to be
Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall
Thoughts of you warm my heart
Forever grateful and thankful with all my heart
For all things youve done, big and small
Daddy, you are loved beyond measure
And missed beyond words
On Fathers Day
And all year around

Chanaka Goonewardene
A steadfast friend
It has been almost a year since we learnt that our close friend Chanaka was ill. As the months rolled by, the mantle of darkness descended swiftly. We witnessed him wither away and become a shadow of his former self, while we stood by his side, powerless.
I for one, could not bear to see him in that state, but my friends bravely stood by him, holding his hand, even though most often, he rejected their support. This was the nature of the man; he could not handle the attention he received to the very end. The suffering he had to endure was finally gone, but for us, we lost our sheepdog; our guide and helper is forever gone. When I say us, I speak for all our friends. All of us depended on this bloke to protect and guide us during our wild escapades. We knew each other from school (St. Peter's College, Colombo) and for most of us, that was counting over 50 years.
As for our core group, which comprised of 15 members, most of us lived within walking distance to our school. Chanaka was exceptional, as were his father and mother, who provided us with much love from our childhood well into our adult years. Those were the days of simple pleasures; the Sunday swims at Kinross, Saturday evening choir practices and after-school movies (9.30 pm) and kottu dinners.
Chanaka possessed the true spirit of a Peterite. He was solid as a rock and was the cornerstone and foundation of the love and friendship that bonded our group into a brotherhood. However, he is gone now, too soon and in the saddest of ways; it is in all sincerity I say, that the love he gave us, may in the end, have been his undoing. His time was not only his, but ours as well; he gave us love, understanding, attention to each of our families, extending to our parents, siblings and even our children. I know for certain that he did the the same for a wider circle; from his colleagues to many he met during his life!
I remember Chanaka had more time for my mother than I ever did, giving her advise on her little investments; in fact, it was a standard joke amongst us that he knew more about what she was worth than I ever did. She loved him as her own and this would be the only time I could ever say that I was glad she was not with us anymore; not to to witness his fate.
It was not just my mother; he was the same with all our parents. Our hearts ache for his mother who had to bury her son. She was not alone as there were many other parents who would have felt as they were doing the same.
How did he give so much of himself Perhaps it was partly because he was single and as much as we urged him to find a partner, for whatever reason, it never happened. He would have made a wonderful husband and father. He was like Santa Claus to all our children when they were growing up. He loved everyone unconditionally, but in the end, he did not find a way to look after himself. We could all sit down and ponder on what he could have done differently, but then again, we know there was no way he would have done anything differently.
We could all be sheep, because he was there for our needs and emergencies. That being said, there was one thing he did not understand and that was how to accept our love and care during his time of need. Chanaka has left us and we believe he has gone to a better place.
As one of our friends said, We would all be joining him someday. Yes, who better than Chanaka to be the vanguard, to prepare a place for us, just like he always did. If Chanaka was our sheepdog, most of us also had a shepherd and that was none other than our dear friend and mentor Rev. Fr. Claver Perera, also dearly departed.
Now both of them are across the river Jordan and as I close this ode to our beloved shepherd and sheepdog, I have taken the liberty of mildly altering a verse in our college anthem:
While in boyhood, there we lingered
Mid a garden's fragrant flowers,
Who would dare to point a finger
When such joys were ours,
Work enduring, play alluring
Filled our happy hours.
Ills all-curing, health ensuring,
In St. Peter's bowers!
Goodbye, my friend; until we meet again.

D. D. Ranasinghe
Pillar of strength
Dharmawansa Dias Ranasinghe, a Deputy Labour Commissioner, passed away in October, 2017, at the age of 96 years.
He was a senior labour officer at Avissawella during the 1950's. His native town was Mudungoda in the Gampaha district. One of my uncles worked with him at the Avissawella labour office who introduced and proposed this genuine and dignified gentleman to my elder sister. I think one of his contemporaries was Arthur De Silva, who also worked with him at the same office. He too, rose to be an Assistant Labour Commissioner.
My mom became a widow when she was nearly 34 years of age when my father passed away suddenly, leaving her with four young girls. There was no financial burden, however, as my father was a wealthy businessman during that era. All four of us received a sound education at Ferguson High School, which was an English Baptist Missionary school.
When my elder sister turned 18 years old, my mom wanted to give her in marriage as early as possible, as she wanted to look for a good son-in-law to strengthen the family as my father was the only child of his family, whereas my mom had only a sister in hers.
As I recall, Chandra Weththasinghe, then the Chief Clerk at the same office in Avissawella believed that D.D. Ranasinghe was the ideal person to marry my sisiter.
Then my mom consulted another uncle who lived in Gampaha; a former Drill Inspector, Lionel Wijesundara.
His advice to my mom was "If you honour a wealth that will never perish, D.D. Ranasinghe is the best person to give your daughter in marriage to."
The wedding was held in 1957 and he was a pillar of strength to our family. Later, he shifted to Havlock Town to educate his children, where he started working in Narahenpita and later, was awarded a scholarship to Britain.
He was a Justice of Peace, Samatha Mandalaya President and a Nawala YMBA member.
When dealing with Labour laws, he was always impartial. He was successful due to his humane principles. He leaves behind five sons, a daughter, six grandchildren and his wife, Somalatha Welikanne. My sister was lucky to be married to Rane aiya.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

Belgium determined to live up to great expectations
SOCHI, Russia, Saturday: Roberto Martinez cant wait to lead an outstanding Belgium side into the World Cup as they prepare to take on Panama in their opening game on Monday.
A team who sit third in the FIFA rankings and who boast what is frequently labelled a golden generation featuring the likes of Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne have come to Russia with a considerable weight of expectation on their shoulders.
They are strongly fancied to progress to the knockout phase as winners of Group G, despite being drawn alongside England, and so it would be a major upset if they slipped up in Sochi against a side making their World Cup debut.
I would like to see that the team can play a game and not play the World Cup, to see a team where they enjoy the responsibility that they carry, Martinez said at the Fisht Stadium here on Saturday.
Im excited. I see the players work, I see them in training, and they are just desperate to perform for the fans back in Belgium.
Belgiums results under Martinez have been excellent, with last Mondays 4-1 friendly win over Costa Rica in Brussels meaning they are unbeaten in 19 matches going back almost two years, to the very start of the Spaniards reign.
I think we know how strong we are and I hope we can show it in this tournament, said the Napoli forward Dries Mertens, who along with his teammates trained in the shadow of the Sochi stadium on Saturday.
The prospect of facing England in Kaliningrad on June 28 is a mouthwatering one.
All going to plan for these sides, first place will be up for grabs. Then there are Martinezs past links to the Premier League and the presence of Thierry Henry and Englishman Graeme Jones on his coaching staff. The majority of his squad either play or have played in England, but for now Martinez is only thinking about Panama.
Getting to the World Cup has been a great result for Panamanian football. I am not expecting an easy game, he said.
DEFENSIVE WORRIES
The Belgians came to Russias Black Sea coast early from their base near Moscow to adapt to the warmer, and more humid, conditions here that could suit the Panamanians better.
Improving on quarter-final exits at both the 2014 World Cup and Euro 2016 has to be the aim, but Belgiums preparations have not been aided by defensive injury problems.
Both Thomas Vermaelen and Vincent Kompany are struggling for fitness, and Martinez can make a change to his 23-man squad as late as Sunday. However, Los Angeles FC defender Laurent Ciman left Russia on Saturday having been with the squad as a standby option.  AFP

Businessmen protest Galle traffic plan
A group of businessmen in Galle town staged a demonstration in protest against the new traffic plan introduced and implemented by Galle Municipal Council last week.
The protestors who started their protest walk from Aicemola Junction to Minuwangoda Junction on the Galle - Wackwella Road, demanded the abolition the new traffic plan as it hampers their businesses. They also claimed that the same plan was implemented on an earlier occasion and had to be withdrawn owing to the objection of the business community.
However, when contacted, Galle Mayor Priyantha Sahabandu said that the new traffic plan was an essential and long-awaited traffic operation strategy to reduce congestion on the Galle - Wackwella highway and the new plan was prepared and unanimously endorsed by the Galle Municipal Traffic Committee.
Subsequently the move on the new traffic plan was unanimously adopted at the General Assembly of Galle Municipal Council. The public commended the new traffic plan of the council. Only a very few traders on Galle - Wackwella Road are against the new traffic design. For the advantage of a few, we are not prepared to pull out from a scheme which is immensely beneficial for the majority of the general public, the Galle Mayor said.
Under the newly implemented traffic plan, on the Galle - Wackwella Road from Minuwangoda Junction, only one-way traffic from Wackwella towards the Galle Central Bus Stand would be allowed. Similarly, from Galle Central Bus Stand up to Muniwangoda Junction along Prof. Bandusena Ginasekara Mawatha (Havelock Place) only one-way traffic would be allowed.
At present, the traffic plan is implemented as a pilot project which will be duly legalized by a gazette notification very soon.

Chinese choice
Science and technology will bring ancient history alive in a wondrous way with a unique exhibition that will reawaken old traditions in the 21st century. It is jointly organised by the China Cultural Centre in Sri Lanka and the Network of International Culturalink Entities (NICE). The exhibits displayed at the Chinese Cultural Centre are unique Chinese cultural relics, incorporating unique design elements of China. The items displayed were beautiful and magnificent.
Inside the Chinese Cultural Centre, a screen offers guests a chance to interact with these relics by putting on equipment. For them, it is like watching 3D. It is absolutely a thrill providing the users with an opportunity to experience Chinas culture in a modern and exciting way.
The exhibition attempts to blend the cultural heritage with technological advancements in a developing China, preserving the most cherished cultural identity of China. The exhibition branded as NICE Choice, is an initiative where they attempt to join culture and development as China moves into the next millennia.
The exhibits are categorised under six unique themes: Beautiful Life, Rhythm of Porcelain, Dream about Dunhuang, Festival Gifts, the Legend of Chinese Kong Fu and Digital China. The Peoples Republic of China believes that this exhibition will add value to the One Belt, One Road initiative which will connect the silk route countries together with a developing China. NICE is a cultural organisation sponsored by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Peoples Republic of China.
All six themes touch Chinas history, trade, health, martial arts, festivals and science and technology.
China Cultural Centre Director Liwen Yue stated that promoting mutual understanding and friendship between Sri Lanka and China is of much importance to the Chinese Cultural Centre here in Sri Lanka.
The program that we are presenting here is also for this purpose. Today you can see cultural products here with a difference. So we would like to present these new forms to the Sri Lankan people. Here we want to familiarise Sri Lankans with Chinese industries and trade. We feel that this exhibition is very creative and hope that Sri Lankans will appreciate it and enjoy it. We want to increase the interest Sri Lankans have in China. In the following days, we hope Sri Lankan people will visit this exhibition and enjoy. We would like to see it grow in popularity. By the six themes, you can get an idea of the Chinese Industries. That is what we want to share with you. The theme we are touching on this year is Creative Cultural Products, said Yue.
Chinese Ambassador Cheng Xueyuan said that this is an excellent opportunity for Sri Lanka to be updated on the developments in China.
I would like to congratulate both the Chinese Cultural Centre and NICE on this exhibition under the theme of Creative Cultural Products. I am very confident that initiatives like this will only afford Sri Lankans the opportunity to learn about China and its developments concerning Chinese Culture. This will pave the way for both countries to learn about each other and learn from each other. Cultural Creative Industries is also a driving and determining force when it comes to economic relations between our two countries and in the world. China is a country that attaches great importance to the development of the cultural industry with any country it engages with. Both Sri Lanka and China have a rich cultural heritage. This foundation links our people together and has been the case for centuries. Our cultural exchanges and corporation are very important promoting in our bilateral relations. In trade too, Sri Lanka and China have an understanding. The Chinese Embassy is working towards this very goal in Sri Lanka, said the Ambassador.
Chinese Creative Cultural Products Week is the 2018 theme of Chinese Cultural Centres international unified program China Week.

Buddhism forbids violence for resolving conflicts
Buddhism is not a religion associated with violence. Buddhism forbids violence for resolving conflicts. Ahimsa is a key word in Buddhism. Ahimsa means not to injure. It is a primary virtue in Buddhism.
The Buddha condemned killing or harming living beings and encouraged mindfulness or Satipattana as a right action (conduct). The rightness or wrongness of an action centres around whether the action itself would bring harm to self and/or others.
Non-violence is the heart of Buddhist thinking and behaviour. Avoid killing or harming any living thing is the first of the five precepts (Panchaseela) in Buddhism.
As Buddhists, wherever we go we must carry the intention of peace, love and harmony in our heart.
Lifes purpose of happiness can be gained only if people cultivate the basic human values of compassion, caring and forgiveness. Recently we saw in newspapers and on TV, some Buddhist monks and laymen behaving in a violent manner.
This type of violent behaviour is against Buddhist teachings. The whole world is watching to see how we behave as Buddhists. When Buddhist priests behave in a violent manner, they are damaging the image Buddhists are having as peace-loving people.
As Buddhist leaders we must remember that we are always peaceloving and against any form of violence.
Buddhist monks and laymen should be very careful of the way they behave in front of cameras of journalists. We should not damage the reputation that Buddhism is a religion that is against any form of violence.

Combank first to provide tokenised Mastercard Payment Gateway
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon in collaboration with Mastercard International has introduced payment processing through Mastercard Payment Gateway Services (MPGS) in Sri Lanka, and has integrated Takas.lk as the first merchant to use this service.
The first and onlybank to offer MPGS in the country, Commercial Bank now provides the merchants a secure, cost-effective way to perform card-on-file transactions through tokenisation, keeping sensitive card details away from merchants systems. This unique feature that allows customers to perform one-click online purchases is fully compliant withPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) requirements.
Tokenisation enables merchants to store the tokanised card number in their systems reducing the risk of exposing actual card numbers. The customers are required to enter the card details (card number, expiry date and cardholder verification value) only on the very first occasion they make a purchase through the website. With this solution, customers of Takas.lk are now able to perform repetitive purchases without having to re-enter card details for such transactions.
Other benefits of using MPGS include access to a comprehensive set of fraud mitigation tools; support to both Mastercard SecureCode and Verified by Visa 3D secure authentication solutions. MPGS alsosupportsdevice optimised payment screenswhich are designed provide a seamless experience to users of various devices.
Commenting on this launch, Commercial Banks Chief Operating Officer S Renganathan said: Commercial Bank is proud to be the first bank to introduce this state-of-the-art technology to Sri Lankan consumers together with Mastercard. The Bank always strives to introduce technology that matters in the lives of customers and we are confident this technology will significantly enhance the online shopping experience of Takas.lk customers.
The Co-Founder/CEO of Takas.lk Lahiru Pathmalal said: Takas.lk is one of the top e-Commerce companies in Sri Lanka because of our emphasis on customer service and our technological edge over everyone else. I believe the ability for us to do one-click in Sri Lanka will enhance the customer experience in a most positive way. Being the first to integrate one-click at this scale is also a testimony to our fully in-house technology team.

Creative Software opens student R&D centre at NSBM Green University Town
Creative Software works closely with Sri Lankas leading universities to give students an early industry exposure, helping them develop their professional skills and giving them a head-start on their careers.
In keeping with this mission, on June 8 Creative Software inaugurated their student R&D space Creative Lab - at NSBM Green University Town IT R&D and Business Incubation Centre. The Lab was ceremoniously unveiled by Dr. Sarath Amunugama Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training.
Creative Lab is a modern, 140 ft2facilitylocated on NSBM campus and designed to mimic a typical office setting at Creative Softwares main R&D centre.
Over the next several months, ten students will be working in the Lab to develop enterprise applications as part of their internship project. The most talented and passionate of students will stand a chance to receive a scholarship to cover their final year tuition, as well as an employment opportunity at Creative Software.
Creative Software Director, Sushena Ranatunga looks forward to the companys continuous collaboration with NSBM. He believes that projects like the IT incubation centre are paramount in training the upcoming generations of IT professionals.
Learning how to code is only a small fraction of what it takes to become a successful [software] engineer. Communication and negotiation skills, creativity, business savvy - these are all important parts of engineering. In that sense, classrooms and work environments are quite different, so I believe that the early industry exposure is essential to bridge the gap between them, said Sushena.
NSBM Green University Town shares this view. According to Head of Career Guidance, Kapila Liyanage, the University will continue to nurture partnerships with the industry representatives to offer their students as many opportunities as possible to put their formal education in practice.
We are grateful to companies like Creative Software for actively enriching the quality of our students education. NSBM strives to create unparalleled educational experience for its students and projects like the IT R&D and Business Incubation Centre will help us on this mission, he said.
Creative Software is a pioneer and leader in Sri Lankas IT industry with almost two decades experience building and managing dedicated teams of software engineers for international clients.
NSBM Green University Town is the only sustainable semi-governmental higher education institute delivering home-grown as well as foreign degree programmes in business, IT and engineering.

Cup holders Germany crash to Mexico defeat
Moscow, Sunday: Defending champions Germany crashed to the first defeat in their opening game of a World Cup since 1982 as Hirving Lozanos clinical finish earned Mexico a shock 1-0 victory on Sunday.
The highly-rated PSV Eindhoven forward struck the winner on 35 minutes after a blistering counter-attack at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow as Mexico beat Germany for just the second time in history.
Germanys preparations for the tournament were plagued by poor results and controversy, and their problems were magnified in the Russian capital, leaving their proud record of never being eliminated in the group stage of a World Cup already in danger.
Joachim Loew started eight of the nine 2014 World Cup winners in his squad, with Mesut Ozil returning from a knee injury and Manuel Neuer back in goal following his lengthy absence for the Group F clash.
Jerome Boatengs build-up to the finals was also hampered by a groin injury, but the Bayern Munich centre-back was on the alert inside 60 seconds to thrust himself desperately in front of a Lozano effort.
A remarkably open start saw Timo Werner sprint in behind the Mexico defence before dragging across the face of goal, while Mats Hummels shot straight at Guillermo Ochoa after a botched clearance.
Neuer held well twice in quick succession, first from a long-range Hector Herrera strike and then again to keep out Hector Morenos header, as Mexico attacked the Germany backline with regularity.
Carlos Salcedo nearly diverted a teasing cross into his own net, while Timo Werner hit tamely at Ochoa when an umarked Julian Draxler appeared the better option.
Mexico continued to threaten, Miguel Layun narrowly unable to latch onto a through ball, but their goal arrived 10 minutes before the break as Germany were again sliced apart.
After Sami Khedira lost possession, Javier Hernandez triggered a lightning counter before finding a charging Lozano, who cut inside a covering Ozil and lashed low inside Neuers near post to spark deafening roars from the sizeable Mexico support.
Germany hit back, Toni Kroos rattling the crossbar with a 25-yard free-kick that needed the fingertips of a scrambling Ochoa to keep it out, but Mexico barely clung on to their advantage.
Marco Reus was introduced on the hour as Loew sought to invigorate a struggling side, while 39-year-old Rafael Marquez became just the third player to feature at five World Cups as he was brought on the tighten Mexicos defence.
Joshua Kimmichs acrobatic overhead kick looped onto the roof of the net, with substitute Edson Alvarez then blocking bravely to thwart Draxler.
Reus also hammered a volley over from a narrow angle before a frenetic finale saw Julian Brandt, just on for Werner, smack the outside of the post with a thunderous effort from 20 yards.
One desperate last attack had Neuer come up for a corner, but a towering header from the veteran Marquez and subsequent claim from Ochoa allowed Mexico to close out an unforgettable triumph. AFP

Egypts Salah in apparent discomfort in World Cup training
GROZNY, Russia, Saturday - Egypts super striker Mohamed Salah needed help from three teammates pulling on a jersey over his injured shoulder on Saturday, according to AFP reporters at the teams training camp.
The Pharaohs best hope in making the last 16 of a World Cup for the first time since 1990 has been having an eventful time at his teams base camp in the Chechen capital Grozny.
Salah watched from the bench as Egypt succumbed to an 89th minute header by defender Jose Gimenez in a 1-0 loss to Uruguay on Friday.
He returned to training on Saturday but was spotted employing the help of three teammates pulling on his top.
The team doctor nevertheless pronounced the Liverpool star 100 percent ready to play in Egypts second match against host nation Russia in Saint Petersburg on Tuesday. But Salah at least he can take comfort in a 100-kilogramme (60 pound) birthday cake he was confronted with on his 26th birthday on Friday.
A video released by the Chechen authorities that has gone viral showed Salah leisurely walking into his hotel lobby suspecting nothing and listening to music on his headphones. He began smiling meekly and suspecting something was not right when a hotel employee shot confetti in his face.
Then Salah spotted the giant cake sitting on a lacquered table. Topped with a golden boot, the towering structure was topped with layers of candles that surely added up to more than 26.
A Chechen man in a smart suit immediately ran up to Salah with a microphone in apparent expectation of a thank you speech.  AFP

Engine makers on track with recovery plan for A320 engines, Airbus says
Engine makers Pratt & Whitney and CFM are on track with a recovery plan after delays left Airbus having to park dozens of aircraft without engines, an executive at the European planemaker said on Thursday.
We have agreed on a plan with both of them to catch up with production, both are now hitting the targets and are on track, which is good news, Klaus Roewe, head of the A320 jet family program, told reporters in Hamburg as Airbus inaugurated a new assembly line for the best-selling single-aisle plane.
The delays in getting engines from United Technologies unit Pratt & Whitney and CFM International, co-owned by Safran and General Electric , have left Airbus lagging behind the pace it needs to reach its full-year delivery goal.
With jets left parked at its production sites while they wait for engines, Roewe said Airbus would have reduced production had it known the extent of the problems.
Did we intend to build so many airframes to park them For sure not, Roewe said. If we had known the size of the technical and industrial problems we might have slowed down production.
He said Airbus would not be parking aircraft by the end of the year, but would still be in arrears in terms of deliveries. Channel NewsAsia

Sri Lankan Equities continued to dip for the 4th consecutive week as the benchmark ASPI lost ~24 points (0.37% W-o-W) to close the week at a YTD low of 6,331.10. Continued losses in local equities were mainly driven by lower activity levels as most major categories of investors remained on the sidelines. Activity levels on the bourse hit a 9-week low as the turnover declined ~29% W-o-W to Rs.2.0Bn (cf. Rs.2.8Bn last week) while daily average turnover for the week declined to a 6-week low of Rs.0.5Bn (cf. Rs.0.6Bn last week).
The low activity levels were primarily due to poor participation levels by Local Institutional and HNI investors who remained on the sidelines this week.
Crossings for the week accounted for just ~17% of the weeks turnover with Commercial Bank accounting for ~27% of the crossings.
Negative investor sentiment has continued to drag domestic equities since May18, resulting in the ASPI dropping ~3.1% between May-June to convert the positive return on the ASPI (up to April) down to a negative -0.6% YTD.
The YTD loss on the more liquid S&P20 Index meanwhile, widened further during the week to 3.9% indicating the persistent negative investor sentiment.
Foreign investor flows to the Bourse meanwhile turned negative this week, despite a net inflow of Rs.60Mn on Monday.
Net foreign outflows over the week consequently totaled Rs.219Mn (cf. inflow of Rs.588Mn last week), reducing the net foreign inflows to CSE so far in Jun18 down to Rs.603Mn. Despite this weeks foreign equity sell-off though, so far in Q218, foreign appetite for Sri Lankan equities has remained positive with total net inflows in Q218 totaling ~Rs1.7Bn (cf. outflow of Rs.2.6Bn in Q118).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from further economic and political developments.
March 2018 quarter earnings rise 25% Y-o-Y
Total market earnings for the recently concluded earnings season indicated Y-o-Y growth, with earnings2 for the Mar18 quarter rising 25% to Rs.99.3Bn.
This compares to the Rs. 79.3Bn recorded by the full market a year ago in Mar17 and the Rs. 85.4Bn recorded last quarter (in Dec17).
Growth over the quarter was driven largely by sectors such as Banks, Finance & Insurance, (+31% Y-o-Y), F&B (+71% Y-o-Y), Teleco (+34% Y-o-Y), Diversified (+32% Y-o-Y) and Construction (+60% Y-o-Y).
While the growth over the quarter was notable, it is also largely reflected i) the traditionally stronger March quarter which remains the financial year end for most companies and ii) exceptional gains from several Insurance companies. Stronger Mar18 quarter earnings also boosted the overall markets full year earnings, and overall corporate earnings for the FY17/183 rose 7% Y-o-Y to Rs. 284Bn (cf. Rs. 265Bn last year).
Despite the Y-o-Y growth, the pace of growth was slower at 7% compared to 26% Y-o-Y growth last year, largely reflecting the general slowdown in overall GDP growth which fell to 3.1% Y-o-Y in 2017 (cf. 4.5% Y-o-Y in 2016).
On a trailing 12M basis meanwhile, Sri Lankas corporate earnings growth rose 12% Y-o-Y to Rs. 299.8Bn. Growth was driven by the largest three contributors to market earnings, Banks, Finance & Insurance (+28% Y-o-Y), Diversified (+20% Y-o-Y) and F&B (+22% Y-o-Y).
The improvement in market earnings helped maintain the CSEs current low PER level of 10.09x, the lowest among its Frontier and Emerging market peers which currently trade at 13x (MSCI FM Index) and 14x (MSCI EM Index).

## Title: Failure to protect

Failure to protect
Over in the US, 2,000 children have been separated from Mexican families who have come over the border awaiting prosecution. We have seen visuals of the bodies of children from asylum seeking boats washing ashore or refugees fleeing quite simply drowning mid-sea.
All those fleeing or forced to cross borders are fleeing for safety and or better lives. The international regime which was meant to coax states to protect their citizens prevent conflicts which do force people to flee have all but failed.
The irony of current refugee flows is that in many instances powerful countries now called on to host refugees have contributed directly or indirectly with the support of arms or financing to fighting groups leading to instability in refugee-generating countries. Iraq, Syria, Libya being examples.
Existing refugee protection regime
Consisting of the 1951 Refugee Convention, its 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, and a variety of other regional instruments has led to some of these refugees gaining protection in other states. Yet as the numbers forced to flee their homes have dramatically risen as a result of the Syrian civil war, some states have demonstrated a marked reluctance to open their borders. Quarrels among European states centre on the correct distribution of the responsibility to receive these refugees (despite the lions share being received by states in the Middle East) and refugees have been securitized and associated with terrorism.
States have a first-order duty not to create refugees. If they do not meet this duty because they engage themselves in persecution, because they fail to protect their populations from violence, famines and natural disasters, or because they lack the capacity to do so, then other states acquire a second-order responsibility to admit those as refugees who cannot be protected through external intervention or assistance.
As this general responsibility is shared by all states, it seems natural to assume that states should also share the burdens of refugee protection and integration. The international law fails, however, to specify any duty of assistance to states faced with large refugee inflows.
State responsibility
State responsibility cannot be reduced to non-deportation and adjudication; it extends to effective protection and eventually integration of those who cannot return. Putting the burdens of refugee integration on so-called frontline states in the vicinity of refugee generating regimes and crises is not merely unfair towards the former but also means that the numbers of those who are provided with protection will be limited by the resources of these states.
Is the Convention itself flawed
The basis for the current regime is the 1951 Refugee Convention, drafted to protect European refugees in the wake of World War II, and later expanded to provide protection to people fleeing persecution around the world. Over the years, there have been calls from all sides to reform the Convention.
The UN refugee agency, which is responsible for supervising its implementation, has generally opposed any suggestion that the Convention needs amending.
Hathaway, director of Michigan Universitys refugee law programme, along with a team of lawyers, social scientists, NGO activists and government officials drawn from around the world, spent a good part of the 1990s coming up with solutions to those weaknesses. The core principle of the model they came up with was to ensure that responsibility for refugees was more equitably shared across states. The method: pre-determined quotas that would be administered by the UNs refugee agency. A common international refugee status determination system would mean that a refugee could turn up at any border and be subject to the same process of assessment. They would then be relocated, usually within the region. Countries outside the region would provide guaranteed funding and resettlement places. The model didnt catch on. It lacked a champion, recalled Hathaway. UNHCR wasnt keen on it, and the idea died.
Hathaway believes that the model may now have come of age. The so-called refugee crisis finally has the attention of leaders in the developed world, while 20 years ago refugees were largely a problem for the developing world. Hathaway has always taken the stance that the problem is not with the Convention itself, but due to a complete failure by UNHCR and states to innovate the way we actually deliver protection.
His model would retain the Convention in its current form but completely overhaul its implementation. It would require a revitalised UNHCR with authority to allocate funds and responsibilities and to administer an international refugee status determination system. Hathaway argues that the budget for this expanded role could easily be generated from the money governments would save by not having to administer national systems for processing asylum claims.
One aspect of Hathaways 1997 model has had to be reworked for modern times. The model initially assumed that most refugees would repatriate quite quickly. Thats not the case anymore, he explained. Weve retooled the model so we work hard on facilitating local integration as we do on repatriation. After a certain period, if refugees cant be repatriated and cant integrate locally, they would be guaranteed a resettlement spot. So were not going to keep producing protracted refugee situations.
Fortress Europe
The European Commission has unveiled plans to roughly triple its spending on border controls in response to the refugee crisis. Spending in the 2021-27 budget period, which is currently the subject of intense negotiations between member states and the EU institutions, would increase to 34.9 billion, up from 13 billion in the current period. The EUs executive says the money would be used to create a new standing corps of 10,000 border guards for the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, and create a fund to integrate and improve member states border management.
3.2 billion would be held in reserve to help member states address unforeseen events that might cause a surge in people from outside the EU trying to cross its external border. Some southern European member states have been on the front line of the refugee crisis, with tens of thousands of people arriving by land and boat to the continent fleeing conflicts, poverty, and disasters in the Middle East and Africa. Southern member states have faced increasing pressure because of a refusal by some countries, including the UK and in the east of the bloc, to accept a quota to redistribute refugees and share the burden with those who are often the arrival point.
This week Italys new right-wing populist government turned away a refugee rescue ship with over 600 people on board, including children and pregnant women. Spains new centre-left government ultimately stepped up to take the people. Border control is one of the priorities of the government of Austria, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency and whose governing coalition includes a far-right party.
Fixing a malfunctioning system
The most compelling reason to reform the international protection regime is that it no longer provides protection for a sizeable proportion of those in need. Instead, it has become increasingly about who can pay, and one of its greatest beneficiaries has become the people smuggling industry.
The regime is also failing states; most importantly poorer states where the majority of asylum seekers and refugees are hosted. A first step towards reducing onward movements by asylum seekers and refugees is to understand why they move.
Among the most interesting proposals for viable alternatives is a shift away from understanding all solutions simply in terms of fixing people in places, whether back at home, in their host country, or in a third country.
It has been suggested that instead, migration and mobility may help secure rights for the displaced in the long term; for example, by entitling refugees to enter the local labour market with the same rights as migrants, or issuing them time-limited labour visas so they have the right to come back to work should their return prove unsustainable. In this sense, perhaps, the idea of durable solutions is now outmoded and might be replaced with enduring solutions.
It is proposed, for example, that a mobility approach may help overcome the underlying obstacle to repatriation, namely the chronic weakness of states recovering from conflict. Why not realise the potential of refugees to contribute to post-conflict reconstruction, by facilitating cross-border strategies that allow them to participate without initially risking returning permanently, providing of course the minimal conditions of safety and stability have been established in the country of origin
It is imperative for the UN SG, a former HC of UNHCR to address the serious gaps in protection now.

The suspects were further ordered to report to Rathgama Police every Sunday.
The suspects are Deva Rathnasiri (father), Deva Kapila (son) and Deva Kanthi (daughter), residents of Rathgama.
As revealed in court, a dispute had taken place between the doctor and the three persons over the surveying of land adjoining the hospital premises, on an order of the Galle High Court, for the purpose of gem mining. As the survey was going on, the doctor had resisted the surveying process, claiming that a portion of the land being surveyed belonged to the hospital. Subsequently, the surveyor had stopped his work and left the spot.
Thereafter the suspects had allegedly gone to the hospital and threatened the doctor, disturbing the official performance of the hospital, about which the doctor had complained to the police. Following investigations into the doctors complaint, Rathgama Police arrested the suspects and prosecuted before Galle Magistrate. Sergeant Devasingha (17205) of Rathgama police prosecuted.

Federer wins 98th ATP title in Stuttgart ahead of return to No 1
STUTTGART, Saturday: Roger Federer claimed his 98th ATP title on Sunday and re-established his unrivalled superiority on grass with a 6-4, 7-6 (7/3) victory over Milos Raonic in the Stuttgart Cup final.
Top-seeded Swiss beat his Canadian opponent for the 11th time in 14 meetings while winning a first Stuttgart title.
Federer, who will be chasing a ninth Wimbledon triumph next month, finally came good on the German grass on his third attempt after losing a semi-final in 2016 to Dominic Thiem and falling in the first round here a year ago to good friend Tommy Haas.
The 36-year-old will regain the world number one ranking on Monday and is playing next week as top seed in Halle.
"It's a great comeback for me," Federer said after completing his 78-minute win.
"I'm so happy to win this tournament in my third attempt. We'll see if being number one again will probably give me a boost."
Federer made a return to the top ATP ranking for a sixth time through his semi-final victory on Saturday over Australian Nick Kyrgios.
He takes the honour back form Rafael Nadal for the second time this season and continues the duel on court between the two modern icons.
Federer kept tight control on the match as he claimed his third title of the season after the Australian Open and Rotterdam and now owns 28 grass trophies including eight from Wimbledon
"I think I played very well not having played for a while," Federer said as he competed this week for the first time since mid-March after skipping the clay season.
"Maybe I was a bit better on the big points."
The Swiss broke twice in the first set to earn it after 32 minutes when his opponent returned long over the baseline.
The second set stayed on serve into the tiebreaker.
A double-fault from the Canadian followed by a return winner from the Swiss set up three match points, with Federer needing only his first as Raonic netted a return.
Federer improved to 21-2 on the season after playing in the 24th grass final of his career.
The 35th-ranked Raonic, a victim of various injuries over recent seasons, was playing a final for the first time in his last 16 tournaments dating to Istanbul last year. AFP

Kiri Vehera Chief Incumbents shooting
Five suspects arrested
The Police have arrested five suspects in connection with the recent shooting of the Chief Incumbent of the Kataragama Kiri Vehera Raja Maha Viharaya, Ven. Kobawaka Dhamminda Thera and another monk.
The Police yesterday said the shooting had been carried out by two 18 year old hit-men hired by the main suspect Asela Bandara for Rs. three million.
A special Police team was able to arrest the main suspect of the shooting Bopegedara Asela Lakmal Bandara who had previously served as a custodian (Kapu Rala) of the Mahasen Devalaya at the temple along with two other suspects named Jayawickrama Kankanamge Nuwan Kumara and Jayawickrama Kankanamge Danushka Kumara on Saturday night at Pepiliyana.
Jayawickrama Kankanamge Nuwan Kumara and Jayawickrama Kankanamge Danushka Kumara were identified as 24-year-old twin brothers who assisted the main suspect in coordinating the attack.
The Police had also arrested the two suspects who are said to have carried out the shooting. They were identified as Marapathiranage Kawishka Dilshan (Kurulu) who was hiding in the jungle in the Wallimathagama area and Galwalagamage Hasan Anuradha (Malli) who was arrested in the Gaminipura area. Both these alleged shooters are residents of Gaminipura in Katharagama and are 18-years-old.
The Police said they had found the firearm used by Kawishka Dilshan dumped near the Manik Ganga in the Gaminipura area while another Galkatas rifle used by Hasan Anuradha was also found in a jungle in the Gaminipura area.
Police Spokesperson SP Ruwan Gunasekara stated that Asela Bandara had promised Rs. 3 million to the two shooters for carrying out the attack.
Investigations were conducted by eight special Police teams under the supervision of IGP Pujith Jayasundara. These Police teams are working further to investigate the involvement of the suspects involved in the incident, SP Gunasekara stated.
Ven. Kobawaka Dhamminda Thera was shot in the temple premises at around 10 p.m. on June 12 while another monk who was with the Chief Incumbent, Ven. Dhamminda Thera also received gunshot wounds.
The two monks were admitted to the Kataragama Hospital and later transferred to the Hambanthota General Hospital.
Later, Ven. Dhamminda Thera was flown to a private hospital in Colombo for further treatment.

Mangala directs State sector Heads
Foot excess staff salary bill
The Government has decided that the heads of state institutions should be responsible for paying the salaries to excess employees working under them.
The Secretaries to Ministries, Heads of Departments, Chairpersons, executive officers and Accountants of Government Institutions should take the responsibility of paying salaries to redundant workers they have employed in addition to the approved cadre, Director of Information, Ministry of Finance and Mass Media M. Ali Hassen said in a press release.
At the same time, the Cabinet has also decided that making relevant statutory payments in time, such as, contributions to the Employees Provident Fund and the Employees Trust Fund of State Corporations, Statutory Boards and Government owned companies is also the responsibility of the heads of such institutions, the release added.
The Cabinet has taken these decisions when the Report of the Final Quarter of the State Sector Employees2017 was submitted by Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera recently.
It is reported that there are over 7,500 personnel employed in various government institutions above the cadre positions approved by the Management Services Department of the Treasury.
The statement went on to point out that it has been computed that there are currently 1,375,499 public servants employed in the entire state sector, including government ministries, departments, provincial councils, and local government institutions and other public enterprises, government owned institutions and state banks at the end of 2017.
During 2017 alone, 23,224 persons were recruited to the state service. At the same time, 5,000 public servants had retired from the services while another 246 were dismissed on various disciplinary actions during the same time.
It was also revealed that there are a large number of vacancies at senior executive level positions of the state sector. The Director General of Management Services Department stated that the main reason for this situation is that there is a limited number of officers who have completed the required number of years in service to be eligible for promotions.
There are 74,872 approved positions for development officers service in the state sector and nearly 18,000 positions out of them are currently vacant. However, the Director General of the Management Service Department further said that it was observed during staff review meetings that development officers attached to certain institutions are not assigned on a particular subject or are not given a specific job of work.
In addition, there are a large number of vacancies in the Engineering, Technical and Technological sectors of the government service but attracting candidates to fill such positions has become a difficult task as the private sector pays more than what is paid to such professionals in the public sector, the statement added. Meanwhile, the Chairman of the Government Nursing Officers Association Saman Rathnapriya said the government needs to further study before going ahead with the decision on making heads of state institutions responsible to pay the salaries of redundant workers.
Responding to the Daily News, Rathnapriya said that although the decision was a good one it may not be practically applicable to some service sectors including Health, Education, Postal and Transportation. Rathnapriya also said that the decision taken by the government perhaps is applicable to specific state institutions, however, even then proper surveys and data analysis should be done beforehand.

In football-mad Haiti, World Cup offers relief from daily grind
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Saturday: Whether they are fans of Argentinas Lionel Messi or devotees of Brazils Selecao, Haitians struck by football fever have brought life on their Caribbean island to a standstill, as the World Cup offers a month-long respite from daily hardships.
The poverty-stricken countrys team languishes in 104th place in the FIFA rankings and did not qualify for the finals in Russia, but that hasnt prevented fans from cheering for their Latin American neighbors to the south.
Only a few cars could be seen early Saturday in downtown Port-au-Princes normally congested streets. But on one sidewalk, dozens of people all hurried in the same direction: towards a small TV set inside a barber shop.
See how empty the streets are -- everyones in front of the screen watching the match! Joe Saintilus said from the shops doorstep.
Authorities have installed several giant screens on major public squares throughout the capital to facilitate World Cup watching.
NO ELECTRICITY, NO PROBLEM
According to the World Bank, a full two-thirds of Haitis nearly 11 million people have no access to electricity, but the director general of the countrys power authority promised early June to step up production to coincide with the sporting event.
The country is still recovering from Hurricane Matthew, which struck in 2016 -- six years after a massive earthquake killed more than 200,000 people. Football, however, offers a form of temporary relief, and World Cup fever is evident.
Inflatable balls, artificial turf and the flags of the World Cup teams have been installed around three big screens at the Champ de Mars, the main public square in Port-au-Prince.  AFP

Garrison against Gota
The press has been full of reports that outgoing US Ambassador Atul Keshap has cautioned and advised former President Mahinda Rajapaksa that the nomination of his brother and US citizen Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as candidate for president in 2020, faces a variety of legal and other obstacles, based on the sum total of which, the United States would not consider the same favourably. The fact that this information was first put out and confirmed by the former presidents office, indicated that the Rajapaksa media team initially at least believed that, being seen unfavourably by the West, is an electoral gain.
This is in line with the messaging of the unsuccessful Rajapaksa campaign in 2015, which strained to cast that election as a Rajapaksa versus the West, a Sri Lanka versus Geneva election. Though in actuality, the 2015 election turned out to be Rajapaksa verses the rest of the political parties and the result is history.
US citizenship provides jurisdiction
Skimming through social media reactions to Ambassador Keshaps observations, a small section of social media users has rather predictably called on the US to mind their own business, that Sri Lankan politics is the sole preserve of Sri Lankans. This does hold true, but only with the confines of and the context of the fact that, no nation lives in isolation by itself, but within the community of nations which imposes certain norms, treaty obligations and an ever-increasing body of international law commitments on nation states. The majority of social media users though are aware of the legal implications and rights of national jurisdiction over citizens.
The real, legal right which the US Ambassador excised over Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was and is his jurisdiction over him as a naturalized US citizen. Being a citizen of a country places certain legal obligations on the citizen and more importantly provides the State with jurisdiction over its citizens.
US law particularly exercises extra-territorial jurisdiction over its citizens, namely that their actions in overseas territories still make them liable to the US under its own laws. Further US law does not permit its citizens to hold political office in foreign governments. An official position like a ministry secretary is allowed, a political office is not. A US green-card holder, who is merely a permanent resident, may do so but not a citizen. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is a dual, US citizen and also a Sri Lankan citizen, thereby being subject to the concurrent dual jurisdiction of both countries.
Ambassador Keshap reportedly made the observation that the skill set required to lead a military and security establishment, where orders are followed without question are not the skills required for managing democratic diversity in a pluralistic society.
There have been claims by some JO stalwarts that US citizenship can be renounced at any time. But US citizenship is not like a job, which you simply resign by sending in a letter. Renouncing US citizenship requires that you leave with a clean slate. US law does not permit its citizens to get out of potential legal jeopardy by simply renouncing citizenship to remove US jurisdiction. In that instance, the US refuses to grant such a release. Accordingly, the various allegations against Rajapaksa, including in the US, regarding especially human rights violations would need to be resolved before US citizenship is cancelled.
19th Amendment, foreign MPs, judges and presidents
The political landscape post the 19th Amendment to the Constitution is somewhat different from the period of the two terms in office. One feature of the 19th Amendment is the specific stricture and prohibition on foreign citizens being members of Parliament.
One MP lost her seat as well through the courts for being a foreign citizen. While the 19th Amendment is silent on the specific issue of a foreign national or a dual citizen being head of state, head of government and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, the laws of natural justice, the original intent of the framers of the constitution and common law if not common sense would create a fairly convincing constitutional fundamental rights case that a foreign dual citizen is ineligible to be Sri Lankas president under our constitution.
After all our basic response to even the Geneva UNHRC resolution for foreign and Commonwealth judges, despite the tradition of Commonwealth commonality of a call to the Bar and the legal profession, is that foreigners cannot be allowed to preside over Sri Lankan judicial processes. It would be weird if they can preside over our state and government. It stands to reason then, that we cannot allow a foreign or dual national to be president.
Precedent of 2010
Political observers would recall how on the polling day of the 2010 presidential election, Wimal Weerawansa, then a rather vociferous minster in the Rajapaksa Government, went on national television while polling was going on, to claim that a vote for the then opposition presidential candidate General Sarath Fonseka, a US permanent resident or green card holder, would be null and void because he is ineligible to be president and a vote for him would be a wasted vote.
The broadcast was only stopped when the Election Commissioner intervened following protests by General Fonsekas campaign and the UNP.
However, Wimal Weerawansa whose monolingual eloquence of speech, has never been in doubt, makes a compelling argument that a foreign citizen (he actually argues even a resident, who is merely a long-term visa holder of sorts) could not and should not be elected the head of state, head of government and commander-in-chief of the armed forces of Sri Lanka.
No doubt Weerawansas verbal heroics in 2010, may well come back to haunt the JO and the Rajapaksas in the run-up to the 2020 elections.

Thursday was World Blood Donor Day (WBDD). Every year on June 14, countries around the world celebrate the occasion. The event, established in 2004, serves to raise awareness of the need for safe blood and blood products and to thank donors for their voluntary life-saving gifts of blood.
The theme of this years campaign is blood donation as an action of solidarity. It highlights the fundamental human values of altruism, respect, empathy and kindness which underline and sustain voluntary unpaid blood donation systems. The slogan adopted for 2018 is, Be there for someone else. Give blood. Share life, draws attention to the roles that voluntary donation systems play in encouraging people to care for one another and generate social ties and a united community.
The campaign aims to highlight stories of people whose lives have been saved through blood donation, as a way of motivating regular blood donors to continue giving blood, and to inspire people in good health who have never given blood to begin doing so, particularly young people.
Activities include commemorative events, meetings, publication of relevant stories, scientific conferences, publication of articles in national, regional and international scientific journals, and other activities that would help in promoting the theme of this years World Blood Donor Day.
Blood is the lifeline of every animal living on the earth. Today, the world is facing deficiency of blood stock and that is causing threat to life. The only way one can see for health care is through blood transfusion. The increasing need for blood globally requires everyone to contribute by donating blood and motivating others for the cause.
World Blood Donor Day provides a springboard for blood safety programs and campaigns throughout the year, as well as wider activities to strengthen blood transfusion services. It is designed to complement rather than replace the national blood donor days or weeks that are organised in a number of countries. Some are held at the same time as World Blood Donor Day while others take place at different times of the year.
Transfusion of blood and blood products helps save millions of lives every year. It can help patients suffering from life-threatening conditions live longer and with higher quality of life, and supports complex medical and surgical procedures. It also has an essential, life-saving role in maternal and perinatal care. Access to safe and sufficient blood and blood products can help reduce rates of death and disability due to severe bleeding during delivery and after childbirth.
Four years ago Sri Lanka was the host country for the global event of World Blood Donor Day. The day also coincided with Poson Poya month, an annual religious holiday that marks the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka and is a time for generosity and celebration.
Sri Lanka has already established a tradition of encouraging people to give blood every month when the moon is full. Social groups organise blood donation sessions on this day on their own premises  often in temples, schools or universities. Some 85 per cent of all donations are collected at these mobile sessions.
In just 12 years, Sri Lanka has achieved remarkable success in reaching a self-sufficient blood supply. Yet sadly in many countries, there is not an adequate supply of safe blood, and blood services face the challenge of making sufficient blood available, while also ensuring its quality and safety.
An adequate supply can only be assured through regular donations by voluntary unpaid blood donors. The WHOs goal is for all countries to obtain all their blood supplies from voluntary unpaid donors by 2020. In 2014, 60 countries have their national blood supplies based on 99-100 percent voluntary unpaid blood donations, with 73 countries still largely dependent on family and paid donors.
Giving blood is the simplest way to do good. Becoming a blood donor doesnt take very much time and energy, but it does allow us to give the greatest gift of all  saving someones life. Each day, tens of thousands of patients at hospitals around the world need blood from donors. Anyone  people we know, our friends, loved ones  can find themselves needing help due to an accident or illness. Our own lives could someday depend on donated blood.
Blood cannot be produced industrially  the only source is a voluntary donor. By giving blood, we can be sure that our medical facilities have the supplies needed to save the lives of all who need blood, as no one can be certain they wont be involved in an accident or other misfortune.
Donor blood is used for difficult operations and complicated births, and in treating patients suffering from cancer, liver disease, haemorrhage, severe injury, anaemia, leukaemia, burns and many other diseases and conditions. Donor blood also makes it possible to carry out many planned surgeries that would not otherwise be possible due to excessive blood loss.
Volunteer blood donors give the greatest gift of all to patients in need at area hospitals  the gift of life! Without their blood donation, patients needing life-saving surgeries would not survive, people fighting cancer and blood ailments would not have platelets and burn victims would not have plasma to heal their wounds.
In most countries, blood donations are voluntary and not compensated. The donors intentions must be without selfish motives and come out of a sincere desire to help others. Giving blood gives that priceless feeling of having really helped others.
That is a special present that could come only from you. You may not have given this much thought. But the greatest gift you can give another human is, literally, life. Donating blood even once can help save the lives of these people -- whether they are newborns needing heart surgery, adults badly injured in car crashes or people of any age suffering from cancer. For you, its just a few moments out of your day but for patients in need, it may save their life.
Dont worry about donating blood, it is a completely safe procedure! Everything is cleaned and sterilised and there are plenty of trained medical professionals on hand to carry this out.
They will only take about one pint of blood which your body can replace in a flash. One of the main components of your blood is plasma. This provides proteins, nutrients and a clotting agent that is necessary to stop bleeding and provides a world of nutrients. So rest assured - nothing is ever wasted. It also helps people in their fight against cancer.

Harmful human activity polluting Mahaweli river
The Mahaweli River faces the danger of joining the band of the 10 most polluted rivers in the world within the next decade due to harmful human activity, a research done by the Peradeniya University Geography Department had revealed.
The 10 most polluted rivers in the world today due to addition of waste and chemicals are Sittram in Indonesia, Mississippi in USA, Sanaro in Italy, Marylavo in Philippines, Yellow river in China, the River Jordan in Israel, Yamuna and Ganga rivers in India, Buri river in Bangladesh and Matanta in Argentina.
The Mahaweli Ganga too is fast getting polluted like these rivers in the world according to research done on it and its tributaries over the last 20 years, according to Dr. (Mrs) Lalitha Dissanayake, a lecturer attached to the Peradeniya University Geography Department.
The main reason for this is unfavourable human activity mostly in the upper reaches of the river and its catchment areas. Undegradable waste including polythene plastics and parts of electronic equipment discarded in the catchment areas of the hill country were daily getting washed away into the river due to heavy rains experienced in the region in addition to the residues of chemicals such as pesticides and weedicides applied into the plantations, she added.
Although waste management schemes are being implemented in Urban areas, the lack of such waste management schemes in the rural sector too had greatly contributed to this unhealthy development, she said.
Dr. (Mrs) Dissanayake said the responsibility of protecting this important water body from further pollution devolved in both authorities and the general public.

Having thick eyebrows says something about your personality
Beauty lovers may be shocked to learn that their brows are saying more about them than they think. New research has shown that people with thick, well-groomed eyebrows are actually rather narcissistic. Dont believe us Just ask the University of Toronto.
Researchers from the university have undertaken a study on narcissistic personalities and that was their conclusion. The team took photos of study participants and had them complete a test that measured their level of narcissism.
They then cropped the photos so that just the eyebrows were visible, before showing them to another study group. These people were able to correctly pick out the participants whose tests identified them as narcissistic, solely by looking at their eyebrows.
Experts concluded that the more distinctive a persons eyebrows were - in terms of thickness and grooming - the more self-centered the person had scored on their test. They suggested this link could be because groomed brows are more recognisable, which is an ideal trait for a narcissist.
Lead Study Author, Miranda Giacomin, PhD, told Cosmopolitan: Narcissists love attention and admiration, and may maintain distinct eyebrows so that they are noticed, recognised, and remembered.
This increases their likeability and maintains their overly positive self-views.
While were all about getting a little attention, were not sure this is quite what were going for when we fill in our brows each morning. Either way, it shouldnt stop you from purchasing another eyebrow pencil.

The Indignity of Celebrity Suicide
The day we learn Kate Spade took her life we are in Rivella, Italy, a small town on the Amalfi Coastit finds us even in this small corner of the world, stamped on the front page of the International Times and in international papers that line the table where we breakfast.
The reporting is invasive and crude. Lines from Kate Spades suicide note, the last words to her daughter are printed worldwide. Speculation and implication of marital troubles at the bottom of it. Next news cycle. Kate Spades sister speaks out, saying that she was not surprised; Kate had suffered from bipolar depression but was afraid to get treatment lest the news break out. A life comes to a tragic end reduced by simplistic statements.
Naval use
After breakfast, our plan is to tour the Villa Cimbrone. In Roman times, the brochure of the walking tour tells us, Villa Cimbrone was an agricultural estate that produced timber for naval use. At the end of the nineteenth century it was abandoned and later rediscovered by an English traveler, Ernest William Beckett, Lord Grimthorpe. He was a member of the group of intellectuals who made the grand tour to Ravello. His personal mission was to recuperate from a deep depression after the death of his beloved wife. The beauty of the estate, the joy it brought, led him to buy it in 1904, to restore it and transform it into his own artful creation. The estate became an elegy to his lost wife; a place where he could honor his grief and preserve her memory with its austere beauty. Carved into the wall of a stone bench are these words:
LOST TO A WORLD IN WHICH I CRAVE NO PART
I SIT ALONE AND COMMUNE WITH MY HEART
PLEASED WITH MY LITTLE CORNER OF THE EARTH
GLAD THAT I CAME NOT SORRY TO DEPART.
Im drunk by the overpowering scent of flowers in the many gardens, along trellises and walls, by the views of the lemon groves and the Mediterranean, dust from the antiquated stones and walkways, by the history of this place embedded in every stone and wall and the ghosts of suicides that in this particular moment are unleashed.
Marble busts
We walk along a path called the Avenue of Immensity. In different parts of the estate are statues of the Greek and Roman gods, Cere, Mercury, Diana, and the Temple of Bacchus, where Lord Grimthorpe requested his own ashes be buried. We follow the map to the the Terrace of Infinity that overlooks the expansive sea. It is lined with eighteenth-century marble busts and from here you can see the coast of Amalfi, the past and the present colliding in its majesty. This is where the sea and the sky feel all of one, where heaven and hell might meet. No better place to honor the dead.
Two days later, we are in Rome, having awoken to the news of Anthony Bourdains suicide. Because I am a writer and an editor, my newsfeed is filled with remembrances from chefs, journalists, editors and writers; the owner of the deli counter Bourdain frequented has left a seat empty for him with his usual breakfast order of scrambled eggs and Nova Scotia lox, Anderson Cooper is reduced to tears on CNN. Universal mourning for a man who brought the world to his viewers through his television show about his travels to remote places, Parts Unknown, a title that takes on a deeper resonance after the news of his death. And still, the airways reverberate with one thought: Why
Spanish steps
We are only in Rome for a day. Our mission is to go to the Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon and then the Spanish Steps. As we enter the square of the Spanish Steps my eye catches on a plaque, THE KEATS-SHELLEY MEMORIAL HOUSE. I knew that the house was in Rome, but I hadnt thought about it on this trip. We ditch the massive crowd at the Spanish Steps and walk up the stairs to the second floor of the house. Its in the foreigners quarter of Piazza di Spagna. This is the house where Keats and his friend and painter Joseph Severn found rooms in November 1820, Keats at the last stages of tuberculosis. When he grew too ill to leave his room, the view from his window was, according to The Keats-Shelley House: A Guide, a constant distraction and delight.
We enter Keatss room, where this great poet spent the remaining days of his life at the age of twenty-five. He died on February 23, 1821. Narrow and long, its walls are painted the beautiful blue of the shutters that line many of the windows along the streets of Rome.
Against one wall is a narrow boat bed, once called a fainting couch, and a bureau and a chair where Severn sat to nurse Keats as he passed. These were his last words to Severn: Lift me up for I am dyingI shall die easydont be frightenedthank God it has come.
We look at the letters and snippets of poems preserved under glass at the museum, the living mask and the death mask taken of Keats after his death. In one of the letters are these words from Severn to Charles Brown, another close mutual friend of his and Keatss, dated December 17, 1820.

Intergovernmental Ministerial meeting on Anti-Doping in Sport hosted in Sri Lanka

Representatives of 29 countries, as well as senior figures from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), are scheduled to attend this years Asia and Oceania Region Intergovernmental Ministerial Meeting on Anti-Doping in Sport, which is due to take place in Colombo in Sri Lanka over the next two days.
The meeting, which is the 15th such annual gathering, will be chaired by Faiszer Musthapha, Sri Lankas Minister for Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports.
It will gather together a number of representatives from Governments and National Anti-Doping Organisations (NADOs) from across the two regions to discuss important anti-doping issues that will help in the fight for clean sport.
This is an important meeting for the region and the global anti-doping movement, WADA President Sir Craig Reedie said.
Asia and Oceania is a part of the world that is growing in importance from a sporting point of view.
Asia alone comprises around 60 percent of the worlds population and 80 percent of the worlds youth, a fact that has not escaped the leaders of many of the worlds biggest sports.
The involvement of Asia and Oceania in the fight against doping in sport is hugely significant and is clearly reflected in WADAs governance, with key members of our various committees hailing from this region.
Above all, this meeting will be a show of solidarity from all countries who attend.
It is pleasing to see such impressive commitment by the Governments of the region to continue to invest their time and efforts in fighting doping in sport, and therefore protecting the rights of the clean athletes of the world.
WADA will be joined at the meeting by the Olympic Council of Asia, representing the sports movement, as well as representatives from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation and 29 Governments.
In a packed agenda, the delegates will discuss how to make the most of Government engagement, how the monitoring of compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code supports capacity building and a range of other topics.
The Government of Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka Anti-Doping Agency are delighted to be hosting this important meeting in Colombo, Musthapha said.
We know very well the importance of maintaining a level playing field for athletes around the world and meetings such as this provide vital information-sharing opportunities for Governments and NADOs throughout the Asia and Oceania region.
We remain committed to promoting the highest standards of anti-doping, both here in Sri Lanka and further afield.
We look forward to a productive meeting and we are delighted that the WADA President Sir Craig Reedie will be in attendance along with other senior WADA figures.
As always, they can be assured of a warm welcome as we continue to work closely together with the sports movement for the good of clean athletes and to fight against doping in sport.
The next edition of the Summer Olympics is set to be held in Asia with Tokyo hosting the 2020 Games.
Tokyo 2020 recently received a boost with Japan enacting a law that will see the promotion of anti-doping activity across all sports.
This legislation, enacted at a plenary session of the House of Councilors of Japan, establishes a legal framework for anti-doping measures  something which Tokyo 2020 President Yoshiro Mori says has been called for globally, and will boost anti-doping activities in Japan.
It will also make it possible for the Japan Anti-Doping Agency, the Japan Sports Council and public authorities to share information and implement anti-doping measures more effectively.
The passing of the law came less than a month after two-time backstroke swimming world champion Junya Koga was removed from the Japanese squad for the Asian Games after failing a drugs test.
The failure marked another blemish on Japans previously good anti-doping record in the build-up to Tokyo 2020.

Kingswood upset Trinity to enter semis
Kingswood won their Milo A division inter-schools Presidents trophy rugby quarterfinal game when they shocked favourites Trinity College by 24 points to 15 at Nittawela on Sunday. At half time the winners led 14-8.
Kingswood kept alive their slim hopes of reaching the semi-finals after their good performance in the league. They beforehand promised a fierce, free-flowing encounter, and they proved it.
The winners underlined their dominance when there forwards played a superb game of rugby. Trinity too responded well, but Kingswood ensured the win. This clash was played in front of fervent fans. Both teams played the first 35 minutes at a fast pace but were unable to convert possession into points.
Credit should go to Kingswoods defence; they really shut down and kept control of the ball. In the first half, though they didnt fire too many shots they also found it hard to hold onto the ball for certain phases of the game.
The second half was a more open affair, but it was Kingswood in control and they were rewarded for it. The winning team did a nice job, they showed plenty of speed and skill.
The tries for Kingswood were scored by Janitha Rajanayake, Asiri Seneviratne, Dananjaya Nuwan and Sachintha Seneviratne. The conversions were done by Hirusha Sampath. For Trinity the tries came from Reshan Bandaranayake and Mahadi Abdullah. Minidu Jayasundera made the conversion and Akitha Sakalasooriya put over the penalty.
Kingswood will meet St Josephs College Colombo in the semifinals at the Sugathadasa Stadium on Saturday.

Kolarov stunner gives Serbia victory
Samara, Sunday: Aleksandar Kolarovs brilliant second-half free-kick gave Serbia a 1-0 victory over Costa Rica in their opening World Cup group match in Samara on Sunday.
The Roma defender made the crucial breakthrough early in the second half with a magnificent effort, and although Serbia missed chances to further extend their lead, they were not overly troubled by the Costa Ricans.
The win puts Serbia in a strong early position in Group E ahead of games against Brazil and Switzerland as they look to reach the last 16 for the first time since becoming an independent country, while Costa Rica have it all to do to repeat their surprise run to the quarter-finals four years ago. Serbia coach Mladen Krstajic handed Branislav Ivanovic his 104th international appearance, making the former Chelsea centre-back the most-capped player in his nations history, moving clear of Dejan Stankovic in the all-time list.
Costa Rica started brightly, with Vladimir Stojkovic diving to save at the feet of Marcos Urena, before Giancarlo Gonzalez headed straight at the Serbia goalkeeper.
The Central Americans should have taken the lead in the 12th minute, but Bologna defender Gonzalez inexplicably headed over when unmarked at the back post with the goal at his mercy. Serbia grew into the game and started to dominate possession, with Costa Rica playing in the same style which brought them so much success in 2014, sitting deep and looking to pounce on the counter-attack.
Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, whose non-selection during qualifying led to Slavo Muslins sacking as Serbia coach, almost broke the deadlock on the stroke of half-time, but his overhead kick was well kept out by Real Madrid keeper Keylor Navas in the Costa Rica goal.
Serbia did take the lead in the 56th minute, though, and in fine style.
The 32-year-old Kolarov fired a sublime left-footed free-kick over the wall, dipping into the top corner past a despairing dive from Navas.
Coach Oscar Ramirez threw on Arsenal forward Joel Campbell, Costa Ricas star player in Brazil in 2014, in search of an equaliser.
Campbells speed almost got him in behind the Serbia defence just seconds after coming on, but it was Serbia who blew a gilt-edged chance to score a second.
Dusan Tadics low cross picked out Filip Kostic, but the substitute miskicked in front of an open goal, perhaps due to a slight touch on the ball by Navas. AFP

He said that in addition to the high construction and labour cost the land prices in Colombo too are very expensive. As a solution to the labour issue we are also forced to import labour from the region.
Commenting on the cost of production he said that this too is accelerating very fast. Asked why there are major housing projects in the rural areas built by the private sector he said it may be because lack of infrastructure.
He said that the Sri Lankan expatriate community who have links to the North and East too prefer to invest in housing options in Colombo due to long travel time needed to North- East.
In contrast the South which is well connected by the Highway has apartment projects and there is more business for developers in the South.
Commenting on their overseas operations he said that Nawaloka Constriction successfully built a mega 4 star hotel project in the Maldives that they won through an international tender. We completed the project ahead of time.
Overseas opportunities
We are fishing out for similar international tenders and are currently negotiating from project in Egypt and Myanmar. Talking about the Nawaloka hospital which changed Sri Lankas private sector health care industry, setting benchmarks he said it was a major success. We are happy that we could create a path to open up a quality world class Sri Lankan private health care industry which also helped to raise the bar of this area.
He recalled that his farther H. K. Dharmadasa saw this demand and build Nawaloka hospital to serve the masses.
The entry of Nawaloka Hospitals into the state dominated healthcare sector in 1985 saw the private health care system take root in Sri Lanka. The launch of the hospital and the overwhelming response it received from the people demonstrated a long felt need for superior healthcare in a pleasant environment, he said.
Today Nawaloka Hospital is considered by patients as a home and not a hospital due to the homely atmosphere we offer for patients. Due to the demand we also expanded by building a new 16 floor wing which was opened recently. Nawaloka hospital also is in consultation with a leading health care company in South Korea for the last four months to introduce more international health care practices and technology to the hospital.
No to Jaffna yet
Commenting on their health care expansions he said that currently their plans are on hold. The hospital wanted to expand to Jaffna but folded up the idea due to issues in the industry. We observe that today there are issues with consultants and the reduction of drug prices too is eating to our profit margins. We want a clear and long term policy by the government for the health care sector.
The strikes launched by Government Medical Officers Association and university students is also creating issue for the industry. Dharmadasa also said that while they pay VAT and several other taxes the small time private hospitals also offer similar services but dont pay their taxes. This has created an unfair platform of competition. Asked to comment on getting involved in the Stock market he said the Nawaloka Hospital has offer 30% and would not move further than that.
As for other companies we would like to keep them as family entities.
He said that today he has given over some of the businesses to his Children who are successfully taking it to the next level moving with the modern global trends.
Cricketing standards dropped
Commenting on Cricket where as one time head of the Cricket Board (BCCSL) Dharmadasa said that the teams standard has dropped.
A free hand should be given to the coach and I think if the current coach Chandika Hathurusinghe too could do a major change to the team which lost the first Test to a B team in West Indies last week.
During my time as the President of BCCSL I hired a top international coach Tom Moody and he made the Sri Lanka team a winning unit. I Also I think the Cricket administration should not have temporary interim boards but a full time interim Board until such time the game improves. Giving future direction to up and coming entrepreneurs he said they must remember that failures are the pillars of success and never give up after starting a business. There are ups and downs and one should not get discouraged and fold up.

Lanka Hospitals marks 15 years of service excellence
Lanka Hospitals PLC commemorated 15 years of service excellence of its Nuclear Medicine Centre recently. The founders of Nuclear Medicine Department of Lanka Hospitals arrived from India to grace the occasion.
Hospitals Nuclear Medicine Centre facilitates a team of experts comprising medical specialists, technicians and nursing staff led by Consultant Nuclear Medicine, Lanka Hospitals, Dr. J. M. Chandraguptha Udugama, MBBS, PhD, one of the three most senior specialists and pioneers in the discipline of nuclear medicine in Sri Lanka.
According to Dr.Udugama, nuclear medicine was introduced to Sri Lanka in 1973 under the purview of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), where the countrys first Nuclear Medicine Unit was established at the Peradeniya Universitys Medical Faculty. Consequently, the second Nuclear Medicine Unit was established at the Colombo National Hospital (formerly known as General Hospital, Colombo).
Lanka Hospitals was the first private hospital in the country to establish a fully-fledged Nuclear Medicine centre, to support the rapidly rising demand. Since then the centre has continued to play a pivotal role in supporting the countrys health care sector for 15 long years.
Lanka Hospitals Nuclear Medicine Centre is equipped with state of-the-art Dual Detector Gamma Camera (SIEMENS-E Cam), a first and only of its kind in Sri Lanka. Adopting a procedure which allows least radiation and discomfort to patients, this gamma camera (scanner) produces high precision imagery of the internal organs at cellular level.
The nuclear medicine scans solely focus on the functionality of the relevant organ. Gamma ray imagery is essential for early detection and diagnosis of illnesses, especially for acute and chronic illnesses such as kidney diseases, cancer and heart diseases and so forth.
Early detection of such illnesses not only helps to prevent aggravation of an illness, but also prevent long term suffering. Moreover, being administered for early treatment has the potential to significantly increase the rate of curability and survival of a patient. Gamma camera scanning is not only safe for the patients but also causes minimum side effects. Therefore, successful diagnosis and treatment at the Nuclear Medicine Centre has earned more referrals year after year.
World class health care facilities, high calibre medical professionals, and breakthrough medical technology has firmly placed Lanka Hospitals in the forefront of Sri Lankas health care sector.

At least 3 killed, 200 injured as strong quake hits Osaka

At least three people were killed and more than 200 injured after a strong quake rocked Osaka in western Japan during the morning rush hour on Monday.
The quake, which hit just before 8am(7am Singapore time), killed three people, including a nine-year-old girl. It alsohalted factory lines and burst water mains, government officials and a public broadcaster said.
Local police said the child died in the city of Takatsuki, north of Osaka city, with media reporting she was trapped when a wall collapsed on her at school.
NHK said an 80-year-old man had also been killed by a collapsing wall, and that the third fatality was a man trapped under a bookcase in his home.
More than 200 people were also injured in the 5.3-magnitude quake, which according to the United States Geological Survey, struck at a depth of 15.4km. The Japanese meteorological agency originally put the quake's magnitude at 5.9 but later raised it to 6.1.
The epicenter of the earthquake was in the northern part of the prefecture at a depth of 13km, the agency said.
No tsunami warning was issued.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters the government was "working united, with its first priority on saving people's lives".

Lessons from Lessing
It is not uncommon for feminist readers to make heroines of great female writers, and view their books and lives as personal models. In My Life in Middlemarch (2014), Rebecca Mead presented a study of George Eliots greatest novel alongside her own changing understanding of its meaning. In a lighter vein, Nina Lorenz Collinss What Would Virginia Woolf Do (2018) addressed contemporary women over forty about their problems with fashion, health, work and sex. Lara Feigel, a scholar, writer and journalist who teaches modern literature and culture at Kings College London, is in this line, but in Free Woman she takes her passion for Doris Lessing beyond academic admiration, intellectual identification, even fan adoration, to a risky obsession.
As she turned thirty-five, Feigel realized that although she had a husband, child, house, job and book, plus a second book in progress and a second child on the way, she found her situation not only oddly unsatisfying, but a betrayal of her adolescent ideals of freedom from the smug structure of middle-class life. But was there a way to integrate her questioning of those structures with her academic career and family responsibilities
Freedom-seekers
She had been re-reading The Golden Notebook (1962), a novel that spoke to the lives of girls and women with an honesty and fullness I had not found in any novelist before or since, and she decided that writing a book about Doris Lessing, the most compulsive of freedom-seekers, would give her an opportunity to learn how to liberate myself from the conflicting desires that stopped me being free.
Then, at a time when she was grieving over a miscarriage, she received a research award from the Leverhulme Trust which allowed her to travel to Africa and California as well as British Library archives in Sussex and East Anglia in search of lessons from Lessing. If my obsession with Lessing had begun with her work, she realized, I was now equally preoccupied with her life. Moreover, she envisioned the book as her own story too, a blend of memoir and biographical criticism.
Feigel was particularly drawn to questions about being a female writer and a mother, and the problem of reconciling a desire for freedom and independence with a need for security and heterosexual love.
She noticed a recurring image of a slammed door in Lessings writings, and wondered whether freedom could come from slamming the door, and discarding the parts of your life that constrain you Surprisingly, in her analysis, she doesnt link that image to the foundational feminist moment of Ibsens Nora slamming the door of the dolls house, as she chooses the terrifying freedom that comes from leaving husband, home and children.
Yet it becomes a motif of her study. She asks, for example, whether Lessing had gained freedom from slamming the door on her first marriage, and concludes that she did not. It had provided only a negative kind of freedom, from one sort of constraint, and motherhood was an even stronger constraint. When I first decided to turn my preoccupation with Lessing into a book, Feigel notes, I knew that the moment would come when I had to confront her leaving her children when she divorced her first husband, and then when she moved from Southern Rhodesia to London.
Research trips
Thats the nagging question all of Feigels friends brought up when she talked about her book. Indeed, it quickly became tiresome how many people mentioned it.
Tiresome, perhaps, because Feigel herself was leaving her little son to go on various research trips, and feeling ambivalent about it. In one of her best chapters, Im setting you free, she looks at Lessings self-deceiving rationales for having and giving up her children. Feigel argues that leaving her children behind was . . . a necessary condition of Lessings bid for freedom, but she is conflicted about leaving her own child even for a short break, and impressively honest in admitting not only her doubts about her bid for freedom, but also her gratifications.
She had always felt vaguely that motherhood would conflict with her literary ambitions: it does seem significant that so many female writers across the centuries have avoided having children. But she wanted them anyway, and knew that she would have childcare support and professional resources unavailable to a young 1940s mother like Lessing.
Conflicting explanations
Still, taking care of a small child can be constraining. When she decided to go away for a while to look at Lessings archive at the University of East Anglia, her three-year-old son was very upset. His tears were wrenching for her, but by the time she got on the train, he was pushed comfortably into a corner of my mind as I read through my notes about Lessing and looked forward to dinners with Norwich friends.She was searching the archive to figure out why Lessing had a third child with her second husband, Gottfried Lessing, when she had so recently abandoned the first two; they had already decided to divorce; and she was about to leave Southern Rhodesia. But Feigal quickly discovered that Lessing gave conflicting explanations in her autobiography and letters  they both wanted to have a child; Gottfried was keen to have a child; neither of them wanted a child and the pregnancy was an accident.
In any case, when Lessings son Peter was born, she was ecstatic, and took him with her to London, where, Feigel suggests, she spent the rest of her life attempting to reconcile her guilt about the children she had left behind with her anxious love for the child who remained. Overall, Feigel discovers that Lessings maternity choices came at considerable costs for the children and did not set her free; but she observes that for her, taking short absences from her son did seem a necessary freedom for both of us. Going away was a method by which . . . the frightening, joyful ties of love could be kept from strangling us.

## Title: Lift glyphosate ban fully

Lift glyphosate ban fully
In recent years, there has been no subject in agriculture as widely discussed as glyphosate, both locally and globally, but no country has rushed into banning this global weed killer in agriculture except Sri Lanka.
The other countries having studied in depth the risks versus benefits, have decided to extend its use as benefits far outweigh the risks. Given the fact that the share of glyphosate exceeds 50 percent of the total pesticide volume that is globally used, the occurrence of some risks is to be expected. No pesticide, for that matter, no pharmaceutical is totally safe. However, in recent times some doctors, especially the SLMA, have been objecting to the lifting of the ban, regrettably without weighing the benefits vis-a-vis the risks. The banning of the weed killer has substantially affected the agriculture of the country.
Two eminent doctors, writing to a newspaper on March 29, opposing lifting of the glyphosate ban, argued that in the absence of a particular policy, and when there is suspected reason for causing harm to the public, action should be to avoid further exposures rather than wait for final proof.
In the same article, weighing the scientific evidence, they concluded that there is no final proof that glyphosate is harmful! If there is no evidence, must the ban continue Why do these doctors not act in the matter of air pollution by vehicle exhaust fumes or the Norochcholai toxic emissions Arent they thousands of times more toxic that glyphosate
Glyphosate, God Natha and SLMA
Cyperus (kalanduru) competing with maize.
The ban was evidently instigated by a flawed hypothesis that appeared in a rubbishy journal in 2014, published by a few scientists, two of them local, of which one is supposedly the local agent for God Natha and has psychic powers rather than a knowledge of science! The hypothesis is that glyphosate-forming complexes with metal ions (calcium and magnesium) in the hard water prevalent in the Rajarata and toxic heavy metals (arsenic and cadmium) from agrochemicals cause kidney damage (CKDu).
This hypothesis has not been supported by any other scientific publications, and has been totally rejected on the grounds of faulty chemistry, by several leading chemists, including a highly reputed professor of chemistry of the Peradeniya University. However, the SLMA came out in support of it! The senior author of the paper even wrote an article in a Sinhala newspaper on the title Glyphosate dissolves reservoir bunds: what talk of kidneys
As per the grapevine, this God Nathas agent cured a sickness of the wife of the then Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, who, as a favour, provided funds for analytical work to be done in the USA relating to the said hypothesis.
That the money for the work was provided by that Ministry is a fact, although this research was outside its mandate. This is the way decisions are made and things happen in this country!
Glyphosate in mothers milk!
Incidentally, the third co-author, now domiciled in California, has just appeared in Sri Lanka and made a few presentations to several audiences, in which, amongst other things, he has claimed, as reported in a newspaper, that even breast milk in US mothers has glyphosate residues. Surely, he should have known that glyphosate in breast milk was a scary claim of an NGO called Moms Across America. It was also supported by anti-agrochemical and anti-GMO food lobbies such as the US Organic Consumers Association, Eco Watch and Democracy Now.
Numerous studies have shown that glyphosate does not bioaccumulate, and a Washington State University study found no glyphosate residues in the breast milk of any of the women tested. More convincingly, an exhaustive 2016 study of the German Federal Institute confirmed that there is no evidence of glyphosate in the breast milk analysed. Incidentally, there was a similar scare of traces of glyphosate residues in wine a few years back. It is laughable when the wine (alcohol) itself is a Class 1 carcinogen! So has this doctor come over again to fool Sri Lankans, having earlier misled our state leaders into banning glyphosate There is no evidence that he has been into any serious research on glyphosate other than being a co-author of the controversial paper referred to above.
Our medical doctors have totally ignored or are ignorant of the massive negative impact of the glyphosate ban on the agriculture of the country. Whilst some countries have prohibited the use of glyphosate in parks and other public places following the International Agency Research on Cancer (IARC) prognostication that glyphosate is likely to cause cancer, no country, to my knowledge, has banned its use in agriculture. As said before, no agrochemical or, for that matter, pharmaceutical that is totally safe, and should the medical fraternity be reminded of the wise words of the founding father of the science of pharmacology, Professor Bombastus Paracelsus (14931541), also professor of both physics and chemistry of the University of Basel, that all substances are poisons; there is none which is not a poison; it is the dosage that differentiates poison and remedy There is no argument that misuse of agrochemicals can pollute the environment and harm peoples health. So will pharmaceuticals if misused. Swallow 25 tablets of paracetamol and you will be dead; half a tablet is adequate to kill a rat.
Bad science and politics
Both bad scientific advice from two of the co-authors of the above cited paper and political pressure brought to bear by a Buddhist priest, also a politician, were responsible for this foolish decision in 2015 to ban glyphosate in the entire country. The story goes that in 2014, the priest, so overwhelmingly anti-pesticide, even dashed his glyphosate file on the presidential candidates table insisting that glyphosate be banned, or otherwise he will return to the opposite camp. He won. The IARC report which appeared soon after the new government was formed, that glyphosate is probably carcinogenic, was also probably instrumental in the ban although it had nothing to do with CKDu.
Sadly, the government made blunder after blunder on the glyphosate episode. It, at the onset, never appointed an expert panel of scientists and medical specialists to study the matter in depth. In fact, the statutory body of professionals on pesticides, the Pesticide Technical Advisory Committee, was never consulted on the matter.
There was only a meeting of the Agriculture Ministry and some officials of research institutions, chaired by the President, at which a key figure was the politician priest referred to above, who in fact dominated the meeting, not even allowing scientists to talk. They all meekly gave into him. A professor of chemistry had attended the meeting on invitation, but was shouted down by the priest when he attempted to explain matters. That is how scientific decisions are made in this country.
Media ethics
The priest did not stop there. Using his political clout, he has prevailed on the media, especially several TV channels to publicise his bad science misleading the public. One channel even named its programme in Sinhala on CKDu the Agricultural Kidney Disease and throughout had programmes with biased people of the ilk of the priest that claimed agrochemicals are its cause. On two occasions I wrote to the channel proposing participation of independent scientists in the programme, especially representatives from the relevant institutions, but never had any response. The media in seeking sensation over fact, too often give erroneous messages to the public. Incidentally, the priests knowledge of agriculture and ecology is so poor that he even questioned, in one of his articles relating to chemical fertilizers, whether forest trees grow with applied chemical fertilizer implying that crops too can grow without it. He is, however, also one of the national leaders of the toxin free-agriculture programme.
Glyphosatecancer story
The 2015 IARC study that classified glyphosate as probably cancer causing overwhelmed environmentalists with joy, especially in Europe, and demanded banning glyphosate. However, many countries in South East Asia were relatively unmoved. That study stated that there is limited evidence of cancer in humans; sufficient evidence of it in experimental animals and strong evidence of genotoxicity caused by glyphosate.
On the other hand, a much wider, US Agricultural Health Study (AHS) that was published last November engaging some 90,000 farmers from two states that regularly used glyphosate did not find evidence of cancer or other health problem in the subjects. A criticism of the latter study is that subjects were followed up only for short periods. However, it continued for over 20 years.
Interestingly, in a California court case by farmers who claimed that their health was affected by glyphosate use, it came to pass that Aaron Blair, an epidemiologist and leader of the IARC study, also a key figure in the AHS, had the findings of the latter with him when the IARC report was published. Had he divulged the AHS findings, the IARC conclusions would have been different. When the court questioned him on this point, he confessed so but stated that he did not reveal the AHS findings at that stage as they were not published. The court decision, finally, was only to carry a label on the glyphosate containers that it is probably cancer causing.
A further report on an in-depth study, that of the Joint Meeting of the Pesticide Residues (JMPR) of the FAO and WHO, 2016, also concluded that there is neither acceptable evidence of carcinogenicity nor of genotoxicity. Despite the confusion and uncertainty, precautions in the use of pesticide are warranted. The IARC classification is one of hazard, implying that safety measures should be taken when using glyphosate, although it has a very high value (2.1 mg per kg of body weight) of allowable daily intake. A lit candle is a hazard if you hold onto your body, but not for lighting your room. The need for taking precautions when using any pesticide cannot be overstressed.
The glyphosate risk is a drop in the ocean compared to the other environmental risks that we face daily. How much of Class 1 carcinogens do we inhale daily from vehicle exhaust fumes The vociferous SLMA should read the explosive report on the Norochcholai coal power plant and jump to action. It is reported that to date 2,400 kg mercury, 14.5 kg cadmium, 78 kg cobalt, 308 kg cromium and many other toxins have been emitted into the environment.
Also, approximately 100 tons of fly ash are emitted per day of which 80 percent is less than 10 microns, and they are blown about, remaining suspended in the air causing serious respiratory ailments.
The glyphosate ban has been lifted for tea and rubber, but there is also a compelling need for glyphosate to cost-effectively control weeds in other crops too. In fact, rubber is the crop that needs glyphosate the least. In banning glyphosate, the government has unwittingly pushed the CKDu farmers from the frying pan to the fire. They have an insurmountable problem of controlling some noxious weeds such as cooch grass and kalanduru (Cyperus), which spread rapidly with their underground propagules. Ploughing and harrowing cannot control them, but glyphosate does it effectively.
At present, their saviour is Indian illicit glyphosate, freely available, but six times the cost in India. The illicit glyphosate trade is no second to the illicit drug trade.
The government should immediately lift the ban on this weed killer for all crops.

Master of almost all the genres except Literary
Imagine youre in an airport boarding lounge, or the waiting room at virtually any train station or bus terminal in the Western world. Maybe you commute to work or school by subway. It doesnt matter. Look around. Somewhere in there, among hundreds of fellow travelers, lurks the shade of a tall, lanky man in a Red Sox gimme cap. Maybe they brought him with them, or bought him at a newsstand after swiping through the turnstile. Maybe they downloaded him, seemingly out of thin air, and hes hiding on an iPad or a Kobo. He may even be lying open in someones lap, real words on a real page. However he appears, though, chances are hes there. Somewhere.
Stephen King
For more than four decades, in more than sixty novels, ten collections of short stories, and half a dozen nonfiction works, King has been one of popular cultures most constant and consistent literary companions. His books have sold hundreds of millions of copies and been translated into dozens of languages. Drawn in by his storyworlds, millions of fans avidly await each release, entranced in ways they might not even understand, yet eager to see what the acknowledged master of modern horror has to offer. Whenever a new Stephen King novel hit the shelves, the mother of a friend of mine always bought two copies: a first-edition hardcover for keeping, the spine never cracked, the dust jacket kept in mint condition, and a softcover reading copy, carried everywhere and read to tatters. Today, a signed first edition of any of Kings early works easily commands thousands of dollars on the used book market. A matched, signed, and uncut set of The Dark Tower novels can be yours on eBay for a little more than $30,000about what many people pay for their first new car.
Countless more people are familiar with Kings work as its been adapted for film and television, whether that means for the big screen by A-list directors (Stanley Kubricks The Shining or Brian De Palmas Carrie) or serialized for broadcast on B-list networks (TNTs Nightmares and Dreamscapes). Many of Kings novels and short stories have been filmed for the straight-to-DVD market, while others have seen worldwide release and won entertainment cultures highest awards. Maybe youve seen The Green Mile or Misery or Under the Dome. Maybe youve read a few of his novels or a collection or two of his short fiction. Maybe you think you know Stephen King.
Think again
One afternoon, as King tells us in the authors notes to The Bazaar of Bad Dreams, his wife, novelist Tabitha King, sent him to the store for batteries and a non-stick frypan. Seems a simple enough task, but one that apparently also required a few other absolute necessities (cinnamon buns and potato chips). While weighing the merits of low-sodium ridged over kettle-cooked, King was approached by an elderly woman. She was a Florida snowbird archetype, he writes, about 80, permed to perfection, and as darkly tanned as a cordovan shoe.
I know you, she said. Youre Stephen King. You write those scary stories. Thats all right, some people like them, but not me. I like uplifting stories, like that Shawshank Redemption. Looking down from his towering height, King told her, I wrote that too. We can only imagine the womans eyes narrowing ever so slightly as she replied, No, you didnt, and then continued down the aisle, primly ensconced in her motorized cart.
The elderly womans disbelief notwithstanding, the sheer range of Kings writing is almost without precedent. To get a sense of his work, go to any large bookstore and see how many different titles he has on the shelves. Browse the publication dates and youll realize that he has averaged more than a book a year, sometimes several in one year, since his breakout novel, Carrie, first appeared in 1974. Not only can few writers lay claim to such productive consistency, fewer still can do so while working in as many different subtypes of genre fiction. While he may be best known for his scary stories, The Eyes of the Dragon and The Dark Tower series, which King himself regards as his magnum opus, are solidly in the realm of epic fantasy. Joyland is a hard-boiled noir crime tale, while the Bill Hodges novelsMr. Mercedes, Finders Keepers, and End of Watchare more at home as murder mysteries.
In terms of critical attention, however, Kings prodigious output has often worked against him. Tony magazines and newspapers often take a certain delight in damning King with faint praise, scorning his work as boarding lounge fiction and deriding it as escapism paddling about at the shallow end of the literary pool. I dont really think of King as a bad writer, begins the Guardians Alastair Harper. As my girlfriend is always reminding me, his portrayals of small-town America are sometimes brilliant.
In 2003, when King received the National Book Foundations Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, an outraged Harold Bloom condemned the decision in no uncertain terms. Writing in the Boston Globe, the so-called dean of American literary critics declared it extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life.

Melania Trump 'hates to see' children separated from their families at borders

In a rare statement on a policy issue, first lady Melania Trump weighed in through her spokeswoman on the immigration crisis taking place at America's borders.
" Melania Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform," her communications director, Stephanie Grisham, told on Sunday. "She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart."
Trump, who has made helping children the crux of her official "Be Best" platform as first lady, had yet to discuss the state of families and immigration, a topic that has been prominent in headlines for days.
A Trump administration policy now charges every adult caught crossing the border illegally with federal crimes, as opposed to referring those with children mainly to immigration courts, as previous administrations did. Because the government is charging the parents in the criminal justice system, children are separated from them, without a clear procedure for their reunification aside from hotlines the parents can call to try to track their children down.
The policy to refer all adults for charges was publicly announced May 7, but the Justice Department announced it would prosecute 100% of the cases referred to it at the beginning of April.
Nearly 2,000 children have been separated from their parents and guardians and placed into holding facilities between April 19 and May 31 of this year, Department of Homeland Security spokesman Jonathan Hoffman told reporters Friday on a conference call.
The public outcry in the wake of images and stories of the children caught in the middle of the controversial immigration policy has sparked fierce debate.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly blamed the Democrats for the situation despite his administration instituting the policy change.
"Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation, for a change!"he tweeted on Saturday."This is why we need more Republicans elected in November. Democrats are good at only three things, High, High Crime and Obstruction. Sad!"

Memorable hat-tricks in FIFA World Cup
Portugal's striker Cristiano Ronaldo is a serial record breaker.
The Portuguese ace set a new record this time as he became the oldest player (33 years) to score a hat-trick in a World Cup fixture.
His heroics helped Portugal to a 3-3 draw against tournament favorites Spain.
Here we take a look at some of the most memorable hat-tricks in the FIFA World Cup.
PAOLO ROSSI FOR ITALY AGAINST BRAZIL 1982 WORLD CUP
Paolo Rossi's hat-trick is one of the most memorable ones since he went into 1982 World Cup without playing any professional football for 2 years.
Rossi was banned for 2 years for his alleged involvement in a match-fixing scandal.
But he silenced his critics with a stunning hat-trick against the dominating Brazilians to hand Italy a win (3-2).
GEOFF HURST FOR ENGLAND AGAINST WEST GERMANY 1966 WC FINAL
England's only World Cup title came because of this crucial hat-trick by Geoff Hurst in the 1966 World Cup final against West Germany.
Hurst's controversial extra-time 120th minute goal guided England to a 4-2 victory at the Wembley Stadium in London.
Hurst is still the only player, till date, to score a hat-trick in the final of a World Cup.
GABRIEL BATISTUTA FOR ARGENTINA AGAINST JAMAICA 1998 WORLD CUP
Gabriel Batistuta scored his first World Cup hat-trick in 1994 but it is his second hat-trick which holds a place in the record book.
His performance against Jamaica in 1998 World Cup made him the only player to score hat-tricks in successive World Cups.
The most amazing part is that his hat-tricks came exactly four years apart as both were scored on June 21.
PELE FOR BRAZIL AGAINST FRANCE 1958 WORLD CUP
Pele might be a three-time World Cup winner, but his only hat-trick came in 1958 World Cup when a 17-year old Pele set the grand stage on fire.
He was not only the youngest footballer to play in a World Cup but also the youngest to score a hat-trick.
It came in a crucial semi-final fixture against France to hand Brazil a 5-2 win.

Messi misery as Iceland hold Argentina, France down Australia
MOSCOW, Saturday: Lionel Messi fluffed his World Cup lines on Saturday, missing a penalty as Iceland held Argentina to a 1-1 draw after France benefited from the first use of the Video Assistant Referee system in tournament history to grind out a victory over Australia.
Just a day after his eternal rival Cristiano Ronaldo scored a sensational hat-trick to secure a 3-3 draw for Portugal against Spain, Messi had a golden chance to write his own headlines.
The Argentine stepped up to the spot with the teams locked at 1-1 in Moscows Spartak Stadium after Rurik Gislason was adjudged to have brought down Maximiliano Meza in the 63rd minute.
But Hannes Halldorsson guessed correctly and palmed away the Argentine skippers side-footed effort and, despite intense pressure, Iceland held on for a famous draw in their debut at a World Cup finals.
Sergio Aguero scored the opener for the two-time world champions in the 19th minute but his strike was almost immediately cancelled out by Alfred Finnbogaso.
A downcast Messi spoke of his disappointment at the penalty miss.
There is a bitterness of not being able to give the team all three points because I think we deserved it, the Barcelona icon said.
Messi is yet to win a major international tournament and time is running out with his 31st birthday looming.
It was another extraordinary result in the history of Iceland, who famously dumped England out of Euro 2016.
The island nation of 330,000 is the smallest country ever to qualify for the finals but emphatically showed they can mix it with the heavyweights.
VAR STEPS IN
In the first match of the day, France launched their World Cup campaign with a hard-fought win against Australia as VAR was used for the first time at a World Cup.
The Group C match in Kazan was goalless when Antoine Griezmann went down after a tackle in the second half. Uruguayan referee Andres Cunha did not award a penalty but after viewing the VAR footage, ruled it was a spot-kick and Griezmann gave France a 1-0 lead.
Minutes later the Socceroos drew level through a penalty of their own, although this time it was awarded by the referee, with Mile Jedinak coolly beating Hugo Lloris.
But Paul Pogba won a tight match for the 1998 champions when his shot bounced over the line off the crossbar in the 81st minute.
VAR has been used to varying degrees of success in Serie A and the German Bundesliga, while FIFA used the system at the Confederations Cup in Russia last year.
Luckily for us the system was there, Griezmann said. When the referee went to see the video, I thought it was a penalty. I was already thinking about how I would take it.
France coach Didier Deschamps said the Euro 2016 finalists must improve.
Its the World Cup, its the first match. But, yes, we must do better, and we can do better, he said.
In the days later games, Denmark broke Perus hearts as the South American country made their first appearance in the finals since 1982.
Peruvian fans have arrived in Russia in droves to celebrate their return to the sporting spectacle, but were left crestfallen after Yussuf Poulsens second-half goal secured a 1-0 win for the Danes in Group C.
Midfielder Christian Cueva missed a penalty for Los Incas to compound their misery.
We had an enormous amount of fans and it was sad they came so far to see us lose, they deserved at least a draw, said Peru coach Ricardo Gareca.
We didnt deserve to lose, but we cant cry over spilt milk.
Meanwhile in Group D, Croatia took advantage of Argentinas slip against Iceland to record a comfortable 2-0 win over Nigeria.
A penalty from Real Madrid star Luka Modric and an own goal from Oghenekaro Etebo secured the points for the Croatians in Kaliningrad, sending them to the top of the standings.
Croatia face Argentina in their second group game.
Its going to be a very difficult match, Modric said afterwards. They have huge amounts of quality, but this win will really boost our confidence and we are going to up our game.  AFP

Mexico's insect food festival
Scorpions and fly larva are just two of the crawling, wriggling lunchtime specials available at Mexico Citys Insect Food Festival.
Visitors flocked to the event to feast on a wide variety of pre-Hispanic plates featuring protein-rich insects. According to historians, ancient Mexican tribes such as the Mexicans and Mayas combined traditional tortillas and beans with ants, locusts, fireflies, butterflies, worms and a wide assortment of flowers for a balanced diet, especially when meat was scarce.
Today, that tradition remains alive. Even mainstream restaurants in Mexico City offer gourmet menu options including gusanos de maguey (century plant worms) and chapulines (grilled crickets). In addition to these deliciously crunchy crawlers, some market merchants sell crocodile, iguana and armadillo meat, as well as ostrich eggs. -AFP

My hands are clear unlike opponents: Sajith
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said his hands have always been clear, and he had not received any money accrued from the Central Bank Bond issue as alleged by a political opponent in the Hambantota district.
He was addressing a meeting held at the Viharagale Maha Vidyalaya in Sooriyawewa after gifting a new bus valued at Rs. 3.5 million to the school recently. He said the person who accused him is a notorious drug kingpin selling drugs via the Easy Cash scheme.
Minister Premadasa said he rendered a selfless service as a Minister and Parliamentarian even by donating his salary and allowances to the 'Sevna Fund' to build houses to the poor. He said his opponents including the former leader of the country alleged that fear suspicion, underworld and lawlessness were reigning supreme in the country today.
This allegation was made by the God Father of the underworld mafia which ruled the Hambantota district during the previous regime.
"People would well recall underworld characters nicknamed 'Patholaya,' Wambotta and Army Gine, who terrorised the district during the previous regime at will with an open licence from the previous regime.
He would therefore remind his accusers the Sinhala dictum. Owa denu parahata, thama sammathaye pihita sita, (Advise others only after abiding by the principles)

Nearly 2,000 minors split from parents at U.S. border
US: Nearly 2,000 minors were separated from their parents or adult guardians who illegally crossed into the United States over a recent six-week period, as debate raged over how to end the deeply controversial practice.
President Donald Trump, facing mounting anger over his administrations zero tolerance border security policy, repeated he is incensed about the family separations but continued to blame opposition Democrats for the crisis, which critics say is one of his own making.
And the President signalled the drama could drag on.
After Trump initially seemed to say he was not keen on a Republican compromise bill that includes a fix to the separation issue as well as DACA protections for young migrants who arrived illegally as children, the White House walked back his remarks.
According to a Department of Homeland Security spokesman, between April 19 and May 31, 1,995 children were separated from 1,940 adults who were being held by US border patrol.
Amid an outcry over the detentions, the DHS official insisted the minors were held in decent conditions.
We have some of the highest detention standards in the world for children, he said.
Some 1,500 boys are being held in a former Walmart supermarket in Texas, and the government is erecting tent structures near the border to house the increasing number of migrant children, including unaccompanied minors, in custody.
With the crackdown in full swing, the detained parents are in jail settings, the official said, awaiting adjudication and possible prosecution for crossing the border. The process can take several weeks.
This administration has made it clear that we are not going to ignore the law any longer, the official said.
Meanwhile, congressional Republicans have struggled to craft a viable immigration plan.
The Republican-led House of Representatives may vote next week on two immigration measures -- a hard-line bill drafted by House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte, and a compromise measure that limits legal immigration while also ending the family separations.
Im looking at both of them, Trump told Fox News.
I certainly wouldnt sign the more moderate one.
Trumps opposition would deal a body blow to efforts to tamp down the border crisis, which has raised alarm among evangelical leaders who backed Trumps campaign.
The administration shows no sign of backing down from its policy of separating children from their parents despite powerful new condemnation from faith leaders, Tom Jawetz, vice president for immigration policy at progressive group Center for American Progress, told AFP.
Hours after Trumps comments, the White House issued a statement saying the president had misspoken.
The President fully supports both the Goodlatte bill and the House leadership bill, according to White House spokesman Raj Shah.
The compromise House Republican bill reportedly would provide $25 billion for a border wall, and detail a process giving young undocumented immigrants permanent residency and a pathway to citizenship.
On Twitter, Trump addressed what he specifically wants in new legislation including full funding for the Wall; an end to a diversity visa lottery and certain categories of family-based migration; and a shift toward merit based immigration for skilled workers.
He also accused Democrats of forcing the breakup of families at the border because they are pushing their own cruel uncompromising legislative agenda.
Democrats went on the counterattack, with top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi calling the Republican proposal simply unworthy of America.
Family separation is an immoral, horrific policy, added Senator Dianne Feinstein, who has introduced legislation to keep immigrant families together.
Trump stressed he opposes the separations. I hate the children being taken away, he said.
But he also repeated the falsehood that Democrats, currently in the minority in Congress, are responsible for a law that mandates family separations.
There is no law that requires parents be separated from their children at the border. - AFP

Presidents Secretary looks into NCP, NWP drinking water projects
Locating suitable water sources for drinking water projects in the North Central and North Western Provinces has been a problem.
President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed the Presidents Secretary Austin Fernando to give priority to solving this problem, in consultation with government agents, chief secretaries in the relevant provinces, and the ministries of water supply, irrigation and water resources management, and Mahaweli development.
A number of discussions have been held in this connection convened by the Presidents Secretary with relevant stakeholder agencies.
As a result of the discussions, it has been decided to obtain the water required for the implementation of Anuradhapura North and Trincomalee mega water supply projects from Mahawilachchiya and Kudawilachchiya tanks and the Yan Oya.
On the instructions of the Presidents Secretary, the NWSDB is to release Rs. 225 million to the Irrigation Department for the renovation of the Kudawilachchiya tank. Steps are being initiated to undertake environment and archaeological impact studies on the Kudawilachchiya tank project.
It has also been proposed to obtain water supply for the proposed Eppawala-Rajangane-Nochchiyagama-Giribawa integrated mega drinking water scheme and for the Thambuttegama water project from the 85000 a.f. capacity Rajangane reservoir. It has been estimated that the total daily water requirement for running the two water projects would be 69,300 cubic metres of water. The Rajangane reservoir would provide 25,300 cubic metres. The Presidents Secretary has instructed stakeholder parties to ensure that the agriculture water supply from the Rajangane tank wouldnt be affected at all as a result of the drinking water ptoject.
In this connection, the Irrigation Ministry has already initiated action to hold a systematic water balance study in the Kalaoya river basin, which feeds the Rajangane reservoir.
The Chinese government has provided a loan package worth Rs. 19,000 million to realize the Thambuttegama water scheme, while the Israeli and Swiss governments are funding the Eppawala-Rajangane-Nochchiyagama-Giribawa integrated water project.
In the meantime, the Mahaweli Authority has agreed to release the required quantum of water to Habarana tank from Mahaweli water system to start the proposed Palugaswewa drinking water supply project. Apart from this, two mega water projects using the Wahalkada and Mahakanadarawa reservoirs as main water sources are under construction.
It has been decided to supply additional water to these two tanks under the Moragahakanda and Yanoya reservoir projects, catering to nearly 200,000 people in Madawachchiya, Rambewa, Padaviya, Kahatagasdigiliya, Mihinthale and Horowpothana areas.
The Irrigation Department has been instructed to ascertain the possibility of providing additional water to the Huruluwewa tank through the Upper Elahera canal system to realize the Galenbidunuwewa water project.
A problem has arisen in finding a suitable water source to feed the Galgamuwa water project. A survey is underway to obtain water from the Siyambalagaskotuwa tank to feed the proposed Puttalam Town (south) water project.

Roy and Buttler set up England win over Australia
CARDIFF, Saturday: Jason Roy returned to the scene of one of his greatest disappointments to score a century as England beat Australia by 38 runs to win the second one-day international at Cardiff on Saturday.
Roy's 120 and stand-in captain Jos Buttler's rapid 91 not out took England to a total of 342 for eight as the hosts went 2-0 up in this five-match series.
Australia opener Shaun Marsh made 131 to became the first Glamorgan batsman to score an international century at the Welsh county's Sophia Gardens headquarters.
But their 304 all out meant world champions Australia had suffered a seventh defeat in eight ODIs.
The Yorkshire duo of fast bowler Liam Plunkett (four for 53) and leg-spinner Adil Rashid (three for 70) shared seven wickets as England won with 17 balls to spare.
It was just over a year ago in Cardiff that struggling Surrey opener Roy, 27, was dropped from the England side that suffered an eight-wicket defeat in the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy by Pakistan, the eventual tournament winners.
Roy though regained his place in and on Saturday he scored his fifth hundred in 60 ODIs.
It was also his first since he made an England record 180 against Australia in Melbourne in January. Wicket-keeper Buttler, captaining 2019 World Cup hosts England after regular ODI skipper Eoin Morgan was ruled out with a back spasm shortly before the toss, followed up with a 70-ball knock that included two extravagant ramped sixes off successive deliveries from paceman Jhye Richardson.
The most Australia have ever made batting second to win an ODI is 334 for eight against England at Sydney in 2011.
Ashton Agar (46) offered Marsh excellent support in a sixth-wicket partnership of 96, before he was stumped by Buttler off Rashid.
But an Australia side missing star batsmen Steve Smith and David Warner, both given year-long bans for their roles in the Cape Town ball-tampering fiasco in March, just fell short.
This result meant three of Australia's national teams had all lost on the same day, the Socceroos beaten 2-1 by France at the football World Cup in Russia and the Wallabies going down 26-21 to Ireland in a rugby union Test in Melbourne.  AFP

Sagala promotes SL for routing maritime crime
Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister and Prime Ministers Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayaka said Sri Lanka, especially with its strategic location in the Indian Ocean, was the perfect location to run a global programme on maritime crime.
Addressing United Nations Security Council Open Arria Formula meeting on Maritime Crime as a Threat to International Peace and Security, Ratnayaka said the Sri Lankan government was delighted with the decision of the Global Maritime Crime Programme of UNODC to relocate the Head of the Programme and his expert team to Sri Lanka, to run global programming across the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Mediterranean and Caribbean from offices in Colombo.
The Colombo Declaration and the Southern Route Partnership were identified as the primary mechanisms to counter narcotics trafficking in the Indian Ocean, at the Ministerial Meeting of the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) in April 2018. Sri Lanka remains committed to the Colombo Declaration and will continue to provide political and regional support in international fora, as I am doing today, Ratnayaka said, addressing the high-profile UN meeting.
Ratnayaka said the Sri Lanka Police Narcotics Bureau with the support of Sri Lanka Customs seized over 1,700 kg of cocaine in major seizures in 2016 and 2017.
This included a seizure of 928 kg of cocaine from an Indian bound merchant vessel, MV Fabiola when it docked at the Colombo Port on December 9, 2016. This haul is the largest cocaine seizure recorded in South Asia with an estimated street value of Sri Lankan Rupees 12 billion, around US$ 77 million. In April 2016, the Police Narcotics Bureau and Sri Lanka Navy in a Joint Maritime Operation seized 101 kg of heroin on a dhow off the Southern coast of Sri Lanka, he said.
There have been reports that drug dhows have travelled eastwards towards Sri Lanka and the Maldives, as recently as February 2018, and due to legal and jurisdictional inhibitions, sharing of such information with affected states was constrained. Just two weeks ago, on 31 May, a dhow ran aground off Innafinolhu Island in the northern part of the Maldivian archipelago, laden with115 kgs of drugs, the Minister added.
We are experiencing a massive explosion of drug trafficking by maritime routes. The use of the Indian Ocean as a major drug trafficking highway  particularly for heroin originating in Afghanistan  poses a maritime security and a maritime law enforcement challenge, Ratnayaka said, adding that one of the major challenges is the lack of a legal finish (such as prosecution) for the majority of drug seizures made within international waters in the Indian Ocean region.

Shattering precedents of public service
The job of no minister, no official was secure for a day. Corrupt fools succeeded corrupt oafs in the highest positions in the land, and fools were removed to make room for imbeciles The Shadow of the Winter Palace, the Drift to Revolution- Edward Crankshaw
One quality I admire about the Sri Lankans is their capacity to accept or let us say reconcile with all the wrongs happening in their lives. Things that we in the West get het-up about, fazes them not. They take them as things to be endured, not challenged; yet another impediment to an endless cycle of life and death.
Somebody from the Works Department will come and dig up in front of their house, blocking access. They write to a government agency, there is no response. Make an appointment to meet an official, he never turns up. Even if you meet the guy, nothing happens. It is not only with the government, in almost every sphere of life their expectations are minimal: go to an eatery, the crockery looks aged, not so clean, get into a bus, its driven like cattle transport, the power supply is interrupted regularly, unannounced. Compounding a dismal reality, they are squeezed by the rising cost of consumer items brought about by inflation, made worse by a weak currency. With all this, I will not say they are an unhappy people. The famous Sri Lankan smile greets you everywhere. In their reconciliation with the unpleasantness of the external, there is something for us to learn.
Peter, a Canadian, is a regular visitor to Sri Lanka. The countrys exotic nature, cultural strangeness, the erratic beat of its public life, the fickleness of its institutions fascinates him. To a visitor from the West, the bonuses of holidaying in a peripheral country in the tropics are irresistible; the warm weather, lush tropical greenery and the bounty that the dollar yields promises unhurried days of ease and indulgence. The tourism dollar is much valued, the tourist most welcome in every sphere.
Although on holiday mode, and carefree, Peter observes the moving scene with shrewd, assessing eyes. He reads the local English newspapers, following the news programmes on TV with interest.
I can relate comfortably to your institutions; the parliament, government departments, judiciary, universities, the constabulary and so on. These are based on British institutions which were established in all former colonies. In my country too there are identical institutions. However, going by the general perception, these institutions seem to be interpreted differently here, seen through different eyes; performing indifferently, in a permanent state of disorder.
As we spoke there on the TV was a news item on university students protesting some issue; scrawny, dishevelled young men screaming out slogans down the busy Galle Road, causing chaos on the Colombo streets. This is not a new phenomenon. Almost from the time of independence, our state-funded universities have been hotbeds of political agitation; not out of resident issues or an inherent political vision of the students, but almost always on the encouragement and manipulation by outside political forces, mainly the left parties. Today, Sri Lankan universities are perhaps the only universities in the world having this kind of constant student agitation. In the meanwhile, the quality of our university education has steadily declined, hardly considered for ranking even among the Asian universities now. Anybody who can afford it, including our legislators and senior administrators, will not consider them, preferring an overseas education for their children.
The young agitators of yesteryear have become the administrators of the state now. They who knew the solutions then are the policymakers/ implementers of today. Social injustices they railed against with such passion in the 1970s and 80s, they have come to symbolise many times more! Incompetent, unresponsive, colourless and corrupt, we have a public service simply not capable of delivering the needs of the 21st Century, defining their role by paying hosannas to politicians or collecting the filthy lucre in the car parks of Colombo hotels. Even a simple office circular drafted by our university products is distinguished only by its ineptness; unhelpful, often contradictory, unfathomable to the public.
In this country, it is nearly impossible to find out the exact procedure when dealing with the government. In my country, the required guidance is available, even online. Your dealings with the government are made clear and transparent. What you need to provide to obtain a Visa, an Import permit, building approval, registering a company so on are clearly stated. If you follow the guidelines, nothing will go wrong. Even when there are problems, the officers use their discretion, in almost every situation, satisfactorily. In any human endeavour, there are always the exceptions, yet it is very rare to have a public servant soliciting a gratuity for his services. There is pride in doing a service well and honestly.
Government bureaucracy
It seems the Sri Lankans value the personal touch a lot. To get government approval you need to meet an official personally. You have to go to him, not on the phone, mind you. Going to him has a cultural meaning, you are the supplicant. If your attitude is humble enough, he may be moved to grant you the favour.
Often, the attitude of the decision maker is so preposterous, it seems an offence against nature to have such a person in a decision-making situation. The type of education they have received cannot give what the character lacks sorely. For many, holding a position in the government bureaucracy is a rise in life, an affirmation of ones self-worth, much more than a mere livelihood to be performed dutifully. Without his office, the man has no stature or personal worth. You amount to something only because you stamp a seal on a document. Without that seal, the piece of paper cannot be moved for the next seal! The file is not complete! The passport is not stamped!
It is not in their interest to show up the system as dysfunctional, ridiculous and corrupt. So the system is made to look complex, mysterious; sage men making ponderous decisions! Why and how the administration works is not for the public to understand. Centuries of harsh feudal governance has conditioned the people to expect no civility from it, leave alone asking questions. Culturally, they relate to the cumbersome ritual of the public servant: a holy man in an inscrutable communion with the mysterious. It matters not that the language of the holy mans commune is incomprehensible, as long as he can bestow the blessings! And what godly harm is there in giving occasional gifts to this intermediary with the unknowable!
Culture and attitudes
Like everything else around us, our administration too is the creation of the intelligence, abilities and the attitudes of the thousand who constitute the service, past as well as present. Not all are bad and inefficient. But none can escape the enveloping culture, it is not the exceptionally good nor the nasty public servant that will determine the overall quality of the service, but the mean, the overwhelming majority; the mediocre, indifferent, incapable mass.
It is the same with our roads; neither the careful, courteous driver nor the reckless, drunk driver defines our road culture. They are only a few, the exceptions, standing at the extreme ends. Our roads are defined by the culture, attitudes and the thinking of the vast majority; the heedless pedestrians, the three-wheelers, bus and other drivers who mock the meaning of a public road.
Canada is a country that scores high in the living standards, happiness index as well as surveys of countries with well-run governments. In the rankings of the Transparency International, Canada is among the least corrupt. On the other hand, Sri Lanka is somewhat at the lower end of the mediocre in these indexes, gradually descending in the order.
It is strange, sometimes at airports, I meet Sri Lankans who are working at managerial levels in international organisations and companies. As senior administrators, they draw good salaries and perks, travel business class, if an airport transit is needed, relax in first class lounges. I suppose they hold themselves out as persons capable of functioning at high levels in different countries and cultures, adding value and addressing difficult issues. But in their country, there is much to be desired. This is a dilemma.

South Africa beat England 23-12 to clinch rugby Test series
BLOEMFONTEIN, Saturday: South Africa took a winning 2-0 series lead over England by winning a full-blooded second Test 23-12 in Bloemfontein Saturday.
After trailing by 12 points early on, South Africa clawed to a 13-12 half-time advantage and dominated a second half in which England rarely looked like scoring.
A crucial score came on 50 minutes when South Africa were awarded a penalty try after the England scrum crumbled under pressure close to their tryline.
It was the 300th Test win by the Springboks since they debuted in 1891 and a wonderful way for loosehead prop Tendai The Beast Mtawarira to celebrate his 100th cap.
England suffered a fifth Test loss in a row as they once again failed to build on a promising start during which they ran South Africa ragged.
The losing streak under coach Eddie Jones began last February in Scotland and France, Ireland and South Africa (twice) have beaten the Red Rose since.
South Africa captain and loose forward Siya Kolisi said: It does feel good. It was really tough -- but we knew what we were coming into.
The most important thing is the crowd -- thank you so much for coming out in Bloemfontein. It was really important for us.
Asked about a second underwhelming start in a row, Kolisi said: I dont know why. The coach always tells us that all he wants is intensity.
As long as we have intensity, we can control the game. The most important thing is the character of the boys... coach Rassie Erasmus is a great leader, he keeps us calm.
England captain and centre Owen Farrell said: We lost momentum in that second half of the first half again.
We will have to make sure we look back at it and see where we went wrong -- but there was some big moments in that game where we were not composed enough.
I know the 2019 World Cup is a part of the big picture. We want to learn our lessons now, start winning now. We are going to have to regroup for next week.
Under-pressure Jones demanded a great start from his team to dent the confidence South Africa gained from a dramatic 42-29 first Test win in Johannesburg last weekend.
And he got it as tries by wingers Mike Brown and Jonny May, one of which Farrell converted, lifted the tourists into a 12-0 lead on 13 minutes.
Brown and May went over in the opposite corners as England made a superb start, looking like a team fed up with the criticism of four consecutive Test losses since February. As was the case last Saturday, the Springboks defence was in disarray early on, struggling whenever the Red Rose took the ball wide.
But just like last weekend, captain and flanker Siya Kolisi rallied his team and they were back in the game on 24 minutes when number eight Duane Vermeulen barged over to score. Fly-half Handre Pollard converted and slotted a close-range penalty soon after to trim the England lead to 12-10 with 30 minutes gone in a frenetic first half.
French referee Romain Poite had his hands full keeping the match from boiling over and warned Kolisi and Farrell he would not tolerate any more foul play.
A minute before half-time, Pollard attempted a 60-metre penalty and to the delight of the Free State Stadium crowd the ball sailed over the bar for a 13-12 half-time advantage.
South Africa brought on fresh props Steven Kitshoff and Thomas du Tolt early in the second half and they soon made their presence as the home team were awarded a penalty try after a scrum.
A Pollard penalty after 67 minutes was the only other second-half score and England hopes of a dramatic comeback suffered a severe blow when loose forward Nathan Hughes was sin-binned.
Cape Town will host the dead-rubber final Test next Saturday.  AFP

Sri Lanka to release 10 Indian fishermens boats
Sri Lankan Navy will soon release 10 Indian fishermens boats, which were taken into custody in 2015 and 2016.
In 2017, over 42 boats out of the 216 boats in the Sri Lankan custody were released. The fishermen were only able to retrieve 32 of the 42 boats as the remaining 10 were damaged beyond repair. Now, the Sri Lankan government has sent a letter to the Indian External Affairs Ministry on June 13, stating that they are ready to release 10 other boats instead of the ones that were not retrieved in 2017.
Today, fishermen and a rescue team headed by Additional Director Fisheries Manikandan are preparing to leave for Sri Lanka in two days to retrieve the boats. The fishermen in the region are demanding that the remaining 174 boats in Sri Lankan custody must be released and added that each boat costs Rs. 8 lakhs to Rs. 10 lakhs.
On July 4, the Indo-Sri Lankan officials are to meet in Delhi and the Tamil fishermen are demanding that their issues be discussed. They also want their remaining boats to be released.
We will go and check the boats in Sri Lanka, but we demand that all our boats in the Sri Lankan custody be released, said Jesuraj, fishermen leader from Rameshwaram.
The Sri Lankan fishermen too are of the opinion that the boats in Sri Lankan custody either be disposed off or returned to Indian fishermen.
These seized boats are docked in our shore and it is so difficult for us to go to the sea for fishing. The tied boats tend to move astray and hit the neighbouring boats, damaging the docked boats as well as ours, said a Sri Lankan fisherman.

Stretch your night!
If you think you are a good sleeper because you spend eight hours in bed every night, think again. Now, sleep researchers are saying that we need to get eight-and-a-half hours of rest every night because we are so stressed out.
We still don't really know why we need sleep - but we know that not getting enough will leave our brains foggy the next day, and raise our risks of many diseases and even early death down the line.
Pennsylvania State University professor, study author and sleep expert Dr Daniel Gartenberg explains why eight hours is just not enough.
The World Health Organization, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health all recommend that adults get at least seven and preferably eight hours of sleep a night.
But there are murmurs among the sleep scientific community that the night needs to be stretched to 8.5 hours, according to Dr Gartenberg.
The modern world may give us reason to sleep more. 'I think we need more sleep now because we are bombarded with so much information,' says Dr Gartenberg.
One of the main functions of sleep is to take all the information we get throughout the day and sort into what's relevant. This process, called synaptic homeostasis, is the focus of much of Dr Gartenberg's research.
'It's the idea that one of the main functions of sleep - besides cell recovery - is to process information,' he says. Now, we're taking in more information than ever - about 34 GB a day.
Even when we go to bed early enough to get the recommended amount of rest, we typically don't sleep that whole time, spending some of it trying to sleep and often waking up at some point in the night - even when we don't realize it.
Light from screens - especially our ever-present smartphones - is in part to blame for sleeplessness but we may be able to leverage them for better, too, he says, and works on projects that aim to do just that.
'Technological devices are hurting us, but we are also coming to a point where some of these wearable techs can be used to accurately measure sleep completely non-invasively and those can be integrated into smart home environments to create what we call "sleep habitats,"' says Dr Gartenberg.
Dr Gartenberg's solution is an app called Sonic Sleep, which uses 'pink noise' to 'round out other sounds' and prevent them from waking you in the night. This fits into one of four components of cognitive behavioral therapy for sleep that he says is the recommended treatment for restless nights. Noise falls under stimulation control. The practice also involves 'sleep hygiene' - things like keeping cell phones out of the bedroom - cognitive training - undoing links between the bed and bad thoughts - and relaxation control.
These techniques are more important now than ever for many people who are getting too little sleep, Dr Gartenberg says.
'It's like a bell curve: there is probably like 30 percent of the population that needs eight hours of sleep and to get that eight hours you really need more than eight hours in bed. Probably around 95 percent of people need between seven and 8.5 hours,' he adds.
'With cell phones and social media, our brains are always a little on; our fight or flight response is always just a little bit activated, so there's this low level anxiety that you may not even notice, but it's there and you have to train yourself out of it.'

Tesco says growth on track as sales rise again
Tesco says its growth plans are on track after it reported a 10th consecutive quarter of rising sales.
UK like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new stores, rose 2.1% in the 13 weeks to 26 May. The supermarket giant said sales had recovered after being affected by bad weather conditions in March.
Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said he was delighted with initial progress on Booker, the food wholesaler that Tesco bought at the end of last year.
Like-for-like sales at the wholesaler - which owns the Premier, Budgens and Londis store brands - rose 14.3% in its first quarter under Tescos ownership.
Lewis said he was pleased with the momentum in the business.
Tescos first quarter sales were a slight slowdown from the 2.3% rise in the fourth quarter, but the group said they were held back by Marchs heavy snow which put people off going shopping.
Lewis said the supermarket was continuing to focus on re-launching its own brand range and was now more than a quarter of the way through this.
The own-brand re-launch is part of Tescos plan to take on discounters Lidl and Aldi, which continue to win market share from the bigger supermarkets. Despite the competition, Tesco is still by far the UKs biggest supermarket with a 27.7% market share, according to the latest figures.
Tescos performance has gradually improved since 2014, when it reported the worst results in its history with a record pre-tax loss of 6.4bn.
Lewis is credited with turning around the group, and his total pay packet was almost 5m last year, a sum some have called excessive. BBC News

A timely decision
Value Added Tax (VAT) is an indirect tax imposed on various goods and services by Governments all over the world. VAT has to be paid regardless of whether you are rich or poor. VAT has become an essential tax for countries such as Sri Lanka, where the number of direct income tax payers is very low as a percentage of the overall population. In more advanced economies, where much of the working population pays direct taxes, VAT or GST (Goods and Services Tax) can be kept to a minimum.
The disparity in the tax paying population in Sri Lanka has led to a situation where the Government has to rely mostly on indirect taxes for revenue generation. In Sri Lanka, the tax ratio is almost 80 percent indirect taxes and 20 percent direct taxes. This should ideally be 50:50, but at least a 60:40 ratio could be achieved in the next few years. The new Inland Revenue laws now in effect have drastically increased the number of direct tax payers and it might indeed be possible to reduce the VAT burden in the next few years as a result. In fact, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera has stated that it would be possible to reduce the VAT by around 2.5 percent from the present 15 percent within the next 2-3 years.
Being a broad-based tax, VAT had to be imposed on many services including the private health sector. While Sri Lanka has one of the best free public healthcare services in the world, many middle class and upper class Lankans prefer to visit private hospitals located in Colombo and elsewhere for medical treatment. They are no doubt convenient, but at a price. Furthermore, many poor patients visit private hospitals mainly to channel specialist doctors in various disciplines. With VAT and hospital charges thrown in, a channelling bill usually exceeds Rs.2,500 which most patients cannot afford. Similarly, VAT is charged on medical tests and all other treatments at private hospitals, which can make a substantial difference to the final bill.
There was a general consensus among the public and politicians from all sides that some relief must be granted from VAT at least for the private health sector, given its critical importance. The Government deliberated on this issue for some time, listening to all stakeholders. After all, the Government has to balance the interests of both the Inland Revenue Department and the public who seek private health services. However, now it has taken the right decision.
VAT on consultancy fees and other fees in private sector hospitals will be removed next week, Minister Samaraweera has told guests at an event held to pay compensation to the 2017 flood affected, in Matara on Saturday. This will in effect be a part of the public welfare programme of the Good Governance programme, the Minister said. This will do away the VAT imposed on consultancy fees and other fees that affect patients.
Accordingly, the proposal to remove VAT on private hospital patients will be handed to the Cabinet tomorrow, by the Finance Minister, on the request of Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have fully endorsed the move.
As Director General of Health Services, Dr. Anil Jasinghe has commented in our sister paper the Sunday Observer yesterday, the onus is now on private hospitals to reduce charges accordingly. In any case, the Government should review all fees charged by private hospitals, since some of the charges for simple tests and procedures appear to be outrageous even without the VAT being added. Private hospitals must be more closely supervised and regulated. The Government should also provide incentive and concessions for investors willing to set up private hospitals and healthcare facilities in the outstations. This will help many middle class patients in those areas who now come to private hospitals in Colombo for treatment.
This Government had created a revolution in the health sector with unprecedented investments for Government hospitals. Several new hospitals are coming up, including a state-of-the-art renal diseases hospital in Polonnaruwa. Judging by the tender notices in newspapers, hospitals islandwide are getting new facilities and equipment. The Government has also reduced the prices of Intra-Ocular Lenses for cataract surgeries as well as stents for heart surgeries. It has also reduced the prices of 48 essential drugs prescribed for a variety of Non Communicable Diseases from hypertension to diabetes. The prices of more drugs are to be reduced soon, especially with plans ramped up to manufacture essential generic drugs locally. Many multinational drugs companies have also expressed willingness to manufacture their drugs locally in collaboration with their local partners or distributors. This should also bring down the prices of medicinal drugs.
As the Buddha stated more than 2,500 years ago, Health is Wealth. Both the public and private health sectors must be geared to achieve the goal of a healthy nation. The proposed VAT removal from private hospitals and other healthcare centres has given an impetus for achieving this noble goal.

Tokyo Cement sponsors Foundation of Goodness for fourth year
Tokyo Cement Group renewed their affiliation with the Foundation of Goodness for 2018, in their bid to support rural cricket development programs carried out by the far-reaching charitable foundation.
This is the fourth consecutive year of partnership between the two organizations which intends to uplift the standard of cricket in the rural sector, as a means to unearth cricketing talent from both southern and northern parts of Sri Lanka.
The partnership, which began back in 2014 with the setting up of training facilities for children from Hikkaduwa and Seenigama, the home base of Foundation of Goodness (FoG), conducts specialized Cricket Coaching Camps for girls and boys from the area.
Kushil Gunasekera, Founder/Chief Trustee of the Foundation of Goodness approached Tokyo Cement Group, with the vision of a program designed to make a positive impact on the lives of talented young cricketers from remote backgrounds, by enabling them to achieve aspirations of a bright future through a successful sporting career.
The Cricket Academy headed by Anura De Silva, Head of Sports at FoG conducts programs with cricket coaches and famed local and international cricket stars. These are held at Hikkaduwa Sri Sumangala MCC Lords and Seenigama Sri Wimala Buddhi Surrey Oval, two cricket grounds managed and operated by FoG with the sponsorship of Tokyo Cement Group.
The series of monthly trainings are conducted by renowned cricket coach Hemantha Devapriya, trainer of Sri Lankas National Womens Cricket Team. Each year, the program touches over 600 promising cricketers from over 15 regional schools in the area. The funding also sees FoG taking40 school cricketers from the South, under its wings for an elite training program that will transform them into National-level Players over time.
The success of the Southern Cricket Coaching Camp at identifying budding talent saw it being extended to the North of the country from August 2017. The programis now held in Jaffna and other key areas such as Killinochchi, Oddusuddan, Mankulam, Mullaitivu, Vavuniyaand Mannar as well, in search of future cricketing sensations.
Plans are underway to extend the program to the East, giving young cricketers from Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts the chance to hone their cricket skills. The North-Eastern Cricket Coaching Camp, also steered by Coach Devapriya and his team, hopes to groom youth from these areas to become future cricket stars who will bring glory to Sri Lanka.
In addition, the FOG Cricket Academy has produced multiple star-class players such as schoolboy cricketer Haren Buddhila Weerasinghe of St. Aloysius College Galle who represented Sri Lanka Under-19 Team at the 2018 World Cup in New Zealand. He was also selected the Best U-19 schoolboy bowler in the 2017/18 season. Young NavinduPahasara of Revatha College Balapitiya is another prodigy in the making at the Southern Cricket Academy.
His performance which included 07 sixes in 07 balls (including a no ball) in one over during the Murali Goodness Cup U-15 Final in Dec 2017 reached the record books as a World Record for this age group. Kaveesha Dilhari from Devapathiraja Girls Team, also a product of the Academy, was selected to play for the Sri Lanka Womens National Team during the T-20 series against Pakistan Womens Team in March 2018.
The partnership also saw Tokyo Cement Group being a Co-sponsor of the Murali Harmony Cup conducted in the North for four consecutive years. The brainchild of the legendary cricketer Muthiah Muralidaran, the tournament brings together nearly 400 cricketers representing 16 Boy schools and 8 Ladies Club Teamsfrom the North and South, exposing them to the energy levels of a T-20 style tournament which unites them in the spirit of sportsmanship.
Tokyo Cement also extended support to Muralis initiative with assistance from Sri Lanka Cricket, to construct 30 concrete cricket pitches for schools in the North and East.

Tracking influenza outbreak
That infectious disease has hit the town once again. Many cases of influenza have been reported from various provinces across the country. The Health Watch speaks to Dr Jude Jayamaha (Consultant Medical Virologist attached to the National Influenza Centre of the Department of Virology, Medical Research Institute) MBBS, PG Dip in Med. Micro., MD (Med. Virology) in order to explore steps that can be taken in order to prevent and control the notorious disease.
Q: What <U+200B>is the latest situation of on going Influenza A outbreak in the country 
A - It is static passed the peak and now slowly decreasing. When there is an outbreak it is usual to report from many provinces.
<U+200B>Q: Who are at risk 
A- Children younger than 2 years, adults aged 65 or older, pregnant women, and people of any age with certain medical conditions, such as, chronic heart, lung, kidney, liver, blood or metabolic diseases (such as diabetes), or weakened immune systems.
Q: What steps should be taken if a <U+200B>person belonging to the vulnerable group suspects that he/she is infected
A - Look for fever, cough, runny nose or difficulty in breathing. Must seek medical attention from a qualified practitioner or come to a hospital Out Patients Department (OPD) and consult a medical officer for further evaluation in the early days of the illness.
<U+200B>Q: Is Tamiflu (Oseltamivir) essential to treat Influenza 
A - <U+200B>No not essential. Influenza infection resolves naturally among most of the infected persons. Very few can develop complications.
If infected anti-virals are given in the hospital. Antibiotics are only given if there is a secondary bacterial infection.
<U+200B>Q: Are there any side after-effects of Influenza A etc <U+200B>
A - As mentioned before majority are cured by their own immunity system. But very few can develop complications such as pneumonia or different organ failure.
<U+200B>Q: How effective is the vaccination against Influenza
A- It is 40-70% depending on few factors like the age, chronic medical condition and the circulating strain.
There are no other vaccines. As side effects, some may have mild sore throat, feverish like feeling, body ache but will overcome within 2-3 days.
****
Health Promotion Bureau Director and prominent Epidemiologist Dr. Paba Palihawadana has outlined several measures which should be adopted by the school authorities.
<U+200B>* The class teachers should give instructions to the students in their class room on Influenza prevention and protection. When the class teachers identify a student/ students with symptoms of possible influenza condition, they should inform the student's parents and let the child/children rest in a separate place (separate from the other students).
* Once the class teacher finds out that the student is suffering from fever, a Paracetamol tablet can be given to the student to control fever. Fifteen (15) Milligram of Paracetamol should be given for one kilogram of the weight of the specific child. The calculation should be done accordingly and carefully.
* If the child shows signs of serious illness (sever symptoms), the child should be hospitalized and then the parents should be informed.
* The parents of Influenza infected children should be instructed to feed their child/children with nutritious food.
* The parents should be instructed not to send the child/children to the school, tution classes and sports activities until the child fully recovers from the sickness and become normal and healthy again. Until then, the child should rest at home.
* Since there is a threat from Dengue fever during these days, all symptoms of the Influenza infected children should take extra care and be alert of symptoms.
* All information about Influenza can be obtained by dialing the hot line 0710107107. The service is free of charge and available during 24 hours. Well qualified doctors and Consultants will reply for all inquiries.
****
The persons in high risk categories such as older people (above 65years) or very young children (bellow 2 years), pregnant women, lactating mothers, people with suppressed immunity and those with chronic diabetes, chronic obstructive airways disease, heart, liver, kidney and metabolic diseases, persons who underwent major surgeries recently, etc should seek prompt medical treatment for influenza from a qualified doctor.
****
(1) To prevent transmission, people should cover their mouth and nose with a handkerchief or tissue when coughing and sneezing.
* In absence of such an item, at least they should cover their face with the help of their elbow.
(2) Smoking raises the risk of contracting influenza, as well as producing more severe disease symptoms. The people should refrain from smoking.
(3) Should not touch eyes, nose or mouth, especially while traveling and in public places.
(4) Everyone should avoid spitting in public.
(5) Wash hands regularly with soap and water or a clean hand with alcohol-based hand rubs is essential.
(6) The used tissues should be disposed carefully and the used handkerchiefs should be washed carefully with germ killer soap/liquid etc before re-using.
(7) Surface sanitizing may help prevent some infections at home, school and office. Alcohol is an effective sanitizer against influenza viruses.
****
According to various scientific researchers in the world, both influenza A and B viruses survive for 24-48 hours on hard, nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic but survive for less than 8-12 hours on cloth, paper, and tissues.
The transmission of virus from patients could occur for 2-8 hours via stainless steel surfaces and for a few minutes via paper tissues.
The influenza virus can survive up to 2 to 3 hours in a droplet. Coughing spreads droplets as far as 6 metres, and sneezing as much as 8 metres.
These droplets stay suspended in the air for up to 10 minutes. People with flu can spread it to others up to about 6 feet away.

Trump puts 25% tariff on Chinese goods
US President Donald Trump is to impose 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of Chinese goods, accusing Beijing of intellectual copyright theft.
Tariffs that affect more than 800 products worth $34bn in annual trade are due to come into effect on 6 July.
The White House said it would consult on tariffs on the other $16bn of products, and would apply these later.
China retaliated, saying it will impose an additional 25% tariff on 659 US goods worth $50bn.
The US had earlier warned that it will impose even more tariffs should China retaliate.
Trump said the tariffs were essential to preventing further unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China, which will protect American jobs.
The Chinese product lines that have been hit range from aircraft tyres to turbines and commercial dishwashers.
In response, China announced tariffs on $34bn of US goods including agricultural products, cars and marine products which will also take effect from 6 July.
Tariffs on other US goods will be announced at a later date, the Xinhua news agency reported.
If the US takes unilateral and protectionist measures that harm Chinese interests, we will respond immediately by taking the necessary decisions to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said earlier on Friday.
All trade talks between China and the US would be void if Washington imposed trade sanctions, he added.
Stock markets dropped in Europe and the US after the announcements with investors concerned about a possible trade war.
The US wants China to stop practices that allegedly encourage transfer of intellectual property - design and product ideas - to Chinese companies, such as requirements that foreign firms share ownership with local partners to access the Chinese market.
However many economists and businesses in the US say the tariffs are likely to hurt some of the sectors the administration is trying to protect, which depend on China for parts or assembly.
Farmers are also worried about harm caused by retaliation.
Economists estimate that the tariffs will hurt GDP by less than half of a percentage point. But the measures could also lead to higher prices and job losses in some industries.
The Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents car parts makers, called the tariffs taxes that hurt U.S. companies, put jobs at risk, and negatively impact consumers.
Boat-makers, which are also facing higher costs due to US tariffs on steel and aluminium, will now be hit with tariffs on almost 300 parts, said the National Marine Manufacturers Association.
The organisation described the tariffs as bad trade policies that are piling up on top of each other. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the dispute could hurt business and consumer confidence.
IMF Director Christine Lagarde said Thursday that a trade war would lead to losers on both sides and could have a serious impact.
The US announced plans for tariffs this spring, after an investigation into Chinas intellectual property practices.
It published a draft list of about 1,300 Chinese products slated for tariffs in April. The list released Friday incorporates feedback and criticism received in the ensuing weeks.
It contains about 1,100 items, including about 285 newly proposed items - such as items for the semiconductor industry - that are subject to further review.
The White House said the measures shouldnt hurt consumers, pointing out that items such as televisions that were included on the draft list had been taken off the list. It will also allow companies to apply for exclusions from the duties.
The plans have elicited a mixed political reaction, drawing praise from Democrats and opposition from Republicans, who typically favour free trade policies.
Senator Chuck Schumer, a leading Democrat, said the presidents actions were on the money
He said: China is our real trade enemy, and their theft of intellectual property and their refusal to let our companies compete fairly threatens millions of future American jobs.
Republican Kevin Brady said it was encouraging that the administration had revised the initial list but urged the White House to further narrow the items subject to the tariffs.
He said: My message has been consistent: we need to hit our target, which is China and its deceptive and harmful trading practices. But I am concerned that these new tariffs will instead hurt American manufacturers, farmers, workers, and consumers. BBC News
