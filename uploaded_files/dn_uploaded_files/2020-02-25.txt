LTTE terrorism defeated militarily
Defence Secretary Maj. Gen. (Retd) Kamal Gunaratne said although the Sri Lankan military had completely defeated LTTE terrorism militarily 10-years ago, the challenge of defeating its separatist ideology still remained as some Tamil politicians were attempting to propagate it in the minds of Tamil people.He said aspirations of majority common Tamil people were different from the ideology of those politicians. The innocent Tamil people who were battered under LTTE terrorism do not want a separate country but some Tamil politicians want devolution of power, he said when he met the visiting Zambian Army Chief Lt. Gen. W.M Sikazwe at the Ministry, today.Referring to military expertise that used in the final war to end terrorism in the country, he said the LTTE terrorists were using asymmetric warfare tactics and the Sri Lankan military had to develop its own asymmetric warfare, which reduced the LTTE to merely an ideology after mid-2009.Maj. Gen. Gunaratne also highlighted the lasting relationship between the two nations which dates back to the heydays of the Non-Alignment Movement (NAM).

World must prepare for pandemic, says WHO
The World Health Organization has said the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic.The WHO said it was too early to call the outbreak a pandemic but countries should be "in a phase of preparedness".A pandemic is when an infectious disease spreads easily from person to person in many parts of the world.More cases of the virus, which causes respiratory disease Covid-19, continue to emerge, with outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran causing concern.However, most infections are in China, the original source of the virus, where more than 77,000 people have the disease and over 2,600 have died.More than 1,200 cases have been confirmed in about 30 other countries and there have been more than 20 deaths. Italy reported four more deaths on Monday, raising the total there to seven.(Source: BBC News)
