Kandy SCs 142nd AGM
Mr. Rugby Malik Samarawickrema, chaired as the Protem Chairman at the Kandy Sports Clubs 142nd Annual General Meeting last Sunday at Nittawela. He is the man who put this century old club on the Cup winning track. This club took 42 years to win a trophy. Samarawickrema said: In rugby, the club enjoyed some outstanding efforts and results on the field and extraordinary effort and effective progress off it helped the club to win every trophy available in rugby. We enjoyed some outstanding performances. The club marked the season in the best way possible with a series playing thrilling rugby and continued to grow in the game at the highest level.
Today people can talk, say anything and hold office, but if not for Samarawickrema, Kandys rugby will be in the same depths like club cricket, football and hockey. If not for him the club would have been like a ship without a rudder. This is a club which has been the most successful in league and knockout rugby. They won the league for the first time in 1994; from this win they have pocketed it 17 times. The first trophy they won was the knockout in 1992. All-in all they have won the knockouts 20 times, which is the most number of wins by any club since the expanded competition commenced in 1950. In the period between 1995 and 2012 the club did not lose a Clifford Cup title, although in 1998 there was no tournament and in 2006 the club withdrew from the tournament. Kandy SC had won the league title consecutive years between 2000 and 2009.
Most of the members are sad, the way the committee was picked, but because of Malik appreciating the excellent work they remained silent. The senior vice president was ignored from being president, considering that there were more seniors than the present president. It was sad to note from the last season's committee 10 members had resigned from their position. Anyway two of the members who resigned made a summersault and were able to get in as president and vice presidents, but the new president was missing at the AGM. It was a sad let down to the rest of the eight members. However the outgoing president Udaya Balasuriya, who stepped down would have been the happiest for under him all the three trophies were housed at Nittawela, and the committee gave him the best of support.
Today, the club ground is an International venue with all facilities, thanks to Samarawickrema. The rest of the club is gifted with all what they need with a modern club house, dressing room, tiers, restaurant, gymnasium and everything that a club requires. The game of rugby has become very popular, with the largest spectator attendance at all matches where Kandy Sports Club is in action.
Samarawickrema said Kandy SC would be a threat once again in the coming rugby season. He said that talent and potential within the players is extraordinary and the effort levels have been incredible all season. Added to this there are a bunch of very experienced and national players as well.
All the sponsors, Singer (Sri Lanka), Cargills (Ceylon) PLC and Etisalat Mobile PLC should be given a big thank you for their passionate support for Kandy rugby.
