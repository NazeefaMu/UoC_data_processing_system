Ven. Rathana Thera said that the government has already taken measures to re-implement the fertilizer subsidy programme claiming that the poor implementation of fertilizer subsidy programme was a reason for their defeat at the local government election.
Before the re-implementation of the fertilizer subsidy programme, I asked the relevant authorities to give me an opportunity to explain the real situation since there is no connection between the fertilizer subsidy and governments defeat at the local government election. Though we made a great contribution in forming this national government, I didnt get a chance to do that. the Ven. Thera said.
He further said that the measures will been taken to make a farmers movement against chemical fertilizer with the fullest corporation of Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
SEMA Chairman and the CEO Asoka Abeygunawardane said with the implementation of the Toxin Free Nation programme, measures have been taken to strengthen and promote toxin free farming practices.
As a result of that, around 5000 farmers has already started to engage in toxin free farming and they have been able to produce 10 million toxin free paddy by the end of 2017.
With the assistance of armed forces, measures had been taken to produce 1 million kilograms of toxin free fertilizer by the end of 2017, he added.
He further added that the researches conducted under the fullest supervision of the Agriculture Ministry have proved the success of toxin free farming.
A larger number of farmers, medical experts, journalists and may other persons those who contributed a lot for the success of toxin free farming were awarded at the occasion.

Theliwatte Joseph, undying fountain of creativity
An icon in Lankan Hill Country Tamil Literature and a resource person, in overall command of Lankan Tamil Literature, this writer of Indian origin is doing something worthwhile even in his 80s. He was born in an estate called Uva Kaddawela near Hali Ela in Badulla district on February 16, 1934. His father was Santhansamy, a teacher and taught In Tiruchirappalli in Thamilnadu. He came down to Lanka as a teacher. Joseph studied in Lanka up to grade 5 and along with his elder brother he went to Kumbakonam in Tamilnadu to study for three years and returned to Lanka to continue his studies at Badullas St Peters College
He started writing in the 1950s but he couldnt establish his identity as a personality to be reckoned with. But when the Virakesari started a page called Thota Manjari covering the lifestyle and culture including literature and the arts, Joseph contributed a few articles. A journalist from Hatton, the late Kaarmegam compiled the popular page.
In 1963, he wrote a feature for two weeks in the Virakesari titled Paaddi Sonna Kathai (the Story that the grandmother told). He got the first prize in the competition held for hill country Tamil Writers. Its more than 50 years old but the University dons recommend this story to their students.
It was only after 1966 that the Ministry of Culture and the Sahitya Mandalaya were established.
The notion that Lankan Tamil Literature is the same as Indian Tamil literature was dismissed. And the true identity of Lankan Tamil literature (and that includes the hill county Tamil literature) came to be reckoned with.

Thomians remember war dead
Semper Fidelis - Always faithful or Always loyal is actually the motto of the US Marine Corps. This is a Latin term used by others as well, for the same purpose. For a military man, it means much. The term instills positive self esteem, sense of belonging, pride and confidence. In a way, Esto Perpetua or Be Thou for Ever gives a similar feeling to a Thomian.
Thomians go to War
March 27, 1918. Ablainzeville - Mayannaville, France. A defence line of the British during World War 1. This period was also known as the spring offensive. All was not quiet, as some thought. There was heavy fighting, with the Germans trying to take control over British positions. A young lad, leading from front was in the thick of battle. Back in Ceylon, many of his friends were in their classes, at the school by the sea, in Mount Lavinia.
As the day progressed, there was so much moaning, groaning and gnashing of teeth at the front lines. When sun went down, wounded severely, in pain, the first Thomian made the supreme sacrifice. The sacrifice for Queen and Country, the annals of Thomian history was recorded with pride and honour. Amidst tears, anguish and sorrow for the family.
Horsfall  The first to fall
Second Lt Basil Arthur Horsfall, fell as a true Thomian, hundred years ago, paving the way for many others to follow him. As a little boy, I remember reading the names of these Thomians, listed on a board in the College hall. He was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously. The highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy, which can be awarded to British and Commonwealth Forces.
His Commanding Officer, Lt Col Rickman later wrote to Basils father, He being wounded severely (in the head) at the time, hearing that the two other platoon commanders on the ridge were both killed and the other platoon commander wounded, he refused to leave his men. Throughout the day, a very heavy fight was continued. Twice your son lost his position but each time he counterattacked, driving the enemy back. He held his ground though his Company had lost 135 out of 180 engaged. In the evening, when both my flanks were driven in on to my headquarters, I sent written instructions to your son to retire on to the line of Ayette. He received the instructions and carried them out, himself remaining behind to supervise the retirement. During the retirement he was unfortunately killed close to the ridge which he had so gallantly held for two days. His body had to be left where he fell, and the ridge has been in the possession of the Germans ever since. By his splendid example and devotion to duty undoubtedly a very critical situation was saved.
A story that swells the heart with a mixture of emotion and pride.
Over 80 young Thomians, died in action or went missing during World War 1. There is no accurate record of how many joined the armed forces during this time. There is also no record to tell how many joined during World War 2 and how many got killed, wounded and went missing.
13 lucky for some  history repeats
February 13, 1985, Kokilai Army detachment. North East coast, a sleepy seasonal fishing hamlet in Sri Lanka. In similar vein, another young Thomian entered not just into the annals of Thomian history, but into Sri Lankan history too. The evening was happy with tea, laughter, chatter and play. Dusk gave no clue of an impending danger or threat that loomed. The night was gentle, warm and humid with not much wind and noise. A night that was going to be long and hard, though.
It was soon going to be cruel to those who were in this little isolated detachment. The stillness of the night was eventually broken by a lightning attack by the LTTE, the first of its kind. LT Shantha Wijesinghe commanding two platoons, led and fought against almost 150 terrorists throughout the night to cause heavy losses to them and saved his men and himself from being annihilated. He had no reinforcements immediately, no casualty evacuation or support. The easiest option for him was to retreat, to live another day to fight.
Shantha chose the harder one, to fight and die. Probably the first time the LTTE used RPGs when the Army did not even have them. He was one of the first soldiers to be awarded a gallantry medal, Rana Sura Padakkama, during the LTTE armed conflict. Although he lived to tell the tale, he died whilst fighting, on May 29, 1987, during Operation Vadamarachchi. He was awarded Weera Wikrama Vibushana posthumously, the third-highest medal for gallantry.
His Commanding Officer, Lt Colonel Vijaya Wimalaratne, himself a decorated soldier, was to write a citation following his death, Major Wijesinghe had a record of being one of the bravest officers in the Army since his extraordinary defeat of the terrorist attack on the Kokilai Army camp. He was in the forefront of almost every major action undertaken by the Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) and IGR. His actions are almost legendary. His tragic death was a great loss to our Army. Major Wijesinghe displayed gallantry, courage and conspicuous bravery of an exceptional order throughout the campaign, in the face of the enemy. He acted instinctively and voluntarily with no regard to the risk of life and personal security, with the aim of safeguarding the lives of his comrades and facilitating the operational aim of his force.
Marvellous feats, which not only make a normal mans eyes moist, but raises the hair of the daring and bold. Many Thomians went down the same road as Basil and Shantha in almost the same manner, in recent times and before. Telling us, at the going down of the sun and in its rising, to remember them. Thomians, solemnly paid tribute to these valiant men on March 27, 2018. This tribute has now become a hallowed tradition and custom of Thomians young and old.
Many and all who gave their lives are heroes. Each and every one of them. But then, there are a few whose stories have made them become legends. Acts that deserve to be shared and told over and over again. Sadly, they cannot be, for many reasons. The men, their blood and their stories hug and nourish the soil where they lay silent. It is only the sweetness of their breath that gives life to the flag, that tells us the story. For Thomians, the above will stand tall always and will be the story of others as well.
The Clarion Call
Men who chose to serve in the armed forces and police have a lot to think before making the decision to join. Especially back then. During our time, options were very limited, if you were not going to be a professional. The good and comfortable life of a company executive or a planter was the obvious choice. To be in the forces, meant firstly, to be away from home and loved ones. Secondly, to be men of steel who would have to go through the harshest conditions, freezing cold or scorching sun. Thirdly, to be prepared to be awake while the nation slept, devoted and brave. Fourthly, to be prepared to pay the ultimate price. A battle situation could range from being generous to horrible. A situation where it would, for an ordinary human, be too terrifying to think of anything else but getting out alive. In other words, to help your comrade who has fallen in pain or leave him and get out yourself.
The Thomian legacy of soldiering (meaning serving in the armed forces and police) may have been due to the fact that most of the men who joined the forces did cadeting. War comics, battleships and bombers too may have inspired some. It was never considered an attractive sport or activity, though. So it was only a few who were daring and courageous who took to this sport cum activity. Although there was no glamour and colour, the rewards were very useful life skills and leadership qualities. During our time, the master in charge, a mentor to many, used to always say, when the cadets were on camp, College discipline was very good and there was peace. Wonder whether it is still so. S Thomas College, Mount Lavinia has produced men who commanded the three services and police at different times.
Thomians have also been in the forefront raising some of the most specialised units in the Army, Navy and Air Force. Now, for the first time, we have the Secretary of Defence who was also a cadet. We are thankful to all of them.
Today, we have what is known as the Old Thomians Cadets Union which is just about four years old. With very humble beginnings, it has now grown in size and stature, over a few years. Its incumbent goal is to promote cadeting in College, support and help its growth. This in turn will help to carry forward the great Thomian legacy of soldiering. We would also like this activity to transcend beyond its immediate goal. As a spillover, we are confident that this nation of ours will have men of honour, courage and leadership, walking past the great granite Memorial, which is so rich in class, character and appeal. Young Thomians as they walk out of the gates, will then remember the lesser sung verse of the College song.
When into the world we goFor our lifes careerAs the call of duty soundsWe will answer clear

Trump and Macron hint at new Iran nuclear deal

US President Donald Trump and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron have suggested there could be a new agreement on Iran's nuclear programme.
After talks in the US, Trump, who is sceptical of an accord that was struck in 2015, spoke about "doing a much bigger, maybe, deal".
Macron said a new pact must cover Iran's ballistic missile programme and its role in the Middle East.
Iran warned of "severe consequences" if the US withdraws from the deal.
In 2015, Iran agreed to mothball its nuclear programme in return for an easing of economic sanctions on Iran.
The US president has been threatening to reject an extension of the Obama-era nuclear pact reached between Tehran and world powers by a 12 May deadline.
Macron had been lobbying Trump to stick with the deal, saying there was no better option.
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to visit the US on Friday to make a last-minute bid to dissuade Trump from potentially torpedoing the agreement.
Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif was quoted as saying that Tehran would "most likely" abandon the accord if the US pulled out.
What did Trump and Macron say in Washington
"I think we will have a great shot at doing a much bigger, maybe, deal," the US president said, adding that any new agreement must be built on "solid foundations".
"They should have made a deal that covered Yemen, that covered Syria, that covered other parts of the Middle East," said Trump, referring to the 2015 accord which he described as "insane".
Meanwhile, Macron agreed that Tehran's influence in the region must be part of negotiations.
He also stressed that - as well as controlling Iran's nuclear programme for the next decade as envisaged by the current agreement - a fresh deal would need to cover its nuclear activities longer-term, as well as its ballistic missile programme.
And he talked about working with President Trump to build a "new framework" in the Middle East - and especially in Syria.
Macron said he did not know whether Trump would extend the 12 May deadline, adding: "I can say that we have had very frank discussions on that, just the two of us."
Trump earlier warned Iran against resuming its nuclear programme.
"They're not going to be restarting anything. They restart it they're going to have big problems, bigger than they've ever had before."

They had come to Sri Lanka for employment and had also engaged in gem business. The Magistrate also banned the suspects from leaving the country. The Court further ordered the FCID to file charges against the suspects since the suspects pleaded guilty.
The Magistrate ordered the Police to file a charge sheet against the suspects on April 27 after obtaining the Attorney Generals advice. Presidents Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appeared for the suspects.

Upholding economic globalization
Since March 2018, the US Trump administration has unilaterally adopted a number of trade protection measures, which might trigger a global trade war that would affect the whole world. These dangerous measures of unilateralism and protectionism are very likely to seriously damage the global economy that is undergoing a difficult recovery, impacting on everyone, in one way or the other.
From a deeper perspective, how countries around the world respond to these challenges is a matter of principle: whether or not we will follow international trade rules, defend the multilateral commercial system, and promote economic globalization We once again stand at the crossroads of human history, and have a major choice to make between openness and isolation, between progress and retreat.
At this important moment of the future of mankind, President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference on April 10th 2018, and gave a firm answer of the Communist Party and the Government of China to this question.
In his speech, President Xi reviewed the achievements of Chinas reform and opening up for the last 40 years, and pointed out a most valuable inspiration: Any country or nation wishing to achieve rejuvenation must follow the trend of the history and times in their pursuit of progress and development. Just as an ancient Chinese classic teaches that heaven has its own law and those who embrace it will prosper.
Broadening market access
President Xi highlighted that we live at a time with an overwhelming trend toward peace and cooperation, openness and connectivity, reform and innovation. Reliance on cold-war and zero-sum mentality looks even more out of place in such times. Openness leads to progress while seclusion leaves one behind. With the future in mind, we should stay committed to build an open global economy, uphold the multilateral trading system, and jointly make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all.
At the end of the speech, President Xi reaffirmed that China would advance reform and opening-up, and announced measures for further measures in that direction, including broadening market access, improving investment environment, strengthening intellectual property rights protection, and expanding imports from foreign countries.
This is the experience of Chinas 40 years of reform and opening up, and also a strategic choice made by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the future of human society. China would always stay determined to build world peace, contribute to global prosperity and uphold the international order.
Facing the US Trump administrations attempt to unilaterally wage a trade war against China, Beijing has taken firm countermeasures in the first place. Chinas position on this issue is very clear: It neither wants a trade war nor willing to fight a trade war. But if a country insists to provoke one, China will follow suit to the very end, taking all necessary measures to defend its rights and interests, and safeguard the rules-based international trading system.
It is gratifying to note that more and more countries, including Europe, Japan, India, and Singapore etc., choose to support trade liberalization and economic globalization in various ways. At the same time, many insightful people from the US political, business and academic community also came forward to explicitly oppose trade protectionism.
It fully demonstrates that economic globalization is still the trend in the world, and the isolated island of protectionism will eventually be abandoned by this wave.
Sino-Sri Lanka pragmatic cooperation
Both China and Sri Lanka have benefited from WTO and the global trade rules, which have contributed to Chinas reform and opening up, and also made Sri Lanka a jewel in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka, with its unique geographical location, has always been actively participating in economic globalization. Under the guidance of the important consensus reached by the leaders of our two countries, the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, and the tide of economic globalization, Sino-Sri Lanka pragmatic cooperation has developed rapidly.
The comprehensive development project of the Hambantota Port has proceeded smoothly and Sri Lanka has added a new important portal to the outside world. The construction of the Port City Colombo is steadily progressing day by day, on which many overseas investors have shown strong interest.
The Economic Corridors of Colombo-Hambantota, Colombo-Kandy are also set to flourish. With all these collaborative efforts, economic development of the island nation is expected to embark on the fast track. As long as it adheres to trade liberalization and economic globalization, Sri Lankas great dream of becoming an important economic center in Asia would surely be realized in coming years.
China is willing to work together with all countries, including Sri Lanka, to safeguard the multilateral trading system, promote further development of economic globalization, build a new form of international relations and a community of shared destiny, so as to bring greater welfare and brighter future to the people of the world.

Warrant re-issued against Jaliya
The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday, re-issued the warrant for the arrest of former Ambassador to the United States, Jaliya Wickramasuriya for his failure to appear before court.
The FCID had filed a B report in the Fort Magistrates Court against Jaliya Wickramasuriya for allegedly misappropriating US$ 330,000 out of US$ 6.6 million allocated for purchasing a building for the Sri Lankan Embassy in the US.
When the case came up before Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne, Wickramasuriya was not present in court. At a previous occasion the Court was informed through his counsel that the suspect has gone abroad for medical treatment with Court permission but failed to return before the due date.
The defence counsel said his client is still receiving treatment at a hospital in USA.
Meanwhile, the Magistrate yesterday issued warrants for the arrest of the two sureties including the wife of Jaliya Wickramasuriya for their failure to appear before court. They had been warned that sureties would be liable for confiscation of bail money, if they failed to appear in court. Two sureties including Wickramasuriyas wife were not present in court yesterday as well.
The FCID was directed to file a report regarding the progress of the investigation on May 24. The FCID alleged that the suspect had misappropriated the concerned amount committed during the purchase of a building to house the Sri Lankan embassy at 3025, White Haven Street, Washington 20008. The former ambassador had remitted this money to Sri Lanka. He is a close relative of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Whither Sri Lankan film industry
What is to be the future of the Sinhalese Film Industry What sort of direction will our films take in the years to come Will there be a change or a deviation in the pattern of picture making already established These questions are difficult to answer with any kind of certainty. To answer them, one not only has to be a student of the local industry and a critic but also a prophet.
One can say this, however. The type of Sinhalese film we are going to get will depend not on the talent (or lack of it) of our producers, our directors and our writers but on their attitude to filmmaking. If they consider that making pictures is a business like the making of safety matches or shoes then we can be pretty sure about the sort of films we are going to produce. If the demand of the box office is to be their sale consideration, our future will be a repetition of the past. Of course, picture making is big business. It costs plenty of money, and time and the skill of a large number of people.
Most powerful medium
Investments must be protected, profits must be made. Producers can with justification point out that all filmmaking countries operate their business on the demands of the box office. Take America, or India or Britain they would say. They make pictures not for fun but for money. All very true. But there is one big difference. Let us take Hollywood where filmmaking is a really big business. The majority of Hollywood films are purely commercial, fashioned deliberately to cater to the demands of the box office. No one disputes that.
Most Hollywood producers want profits. But some of them have a sense of idealism too. They tackle occasionally a daring story, some unusual theme. They introduce new techniques to the art of the motion picture. They present controversial subjects. They even risk their money by breaking every box office formula they themselves have helped to establish; and what is the result Each year from Hollywood we get half a dozen first-rate pictures, and occasionally a masterpiece.
These men realise that profits alone, important though they are, cannot ensure the future of the industry. There must be an experiment. Reasonable risks must be taken if only to promote the interests of the industry. Above all, I feel they have a sense of obligation to the medium and the public they serve.
For it must be realised that the motion picture is a medium not merely of entertainment but of instruction and persuasion. It cannot only debase the public taste. It can elevate it too. It might be well for some of our producers to realise that they are playing about with the most powerful medium of our time. Now if we turn to our country what can we show We have ten years of picture making but little to our credit.
A visiting American who once conducted a survey of our industry is supposed to have remarked after seeing three Sinhalese films that we probably make the worst pictures in the world. It is not a very flattering comment on our industry.
It might be said in extenuation that ours is a young industry. This is rubbish. Ten years is a long time, long enough for the Sinhalese film to have grown up.
What of the technical standards of our films in the future Will they improve They certainly wont if our producers take up the attitude that anything is good enough for Ceylon. Far more important for the future of our industry is for us directors to master the language of the cinema. Our films tend to be photographed stage plays. A story told through dialogue is not a film. It is a play. It does not belong to the screen but to the stage. In cinema, the images are supreme. If the picture does not talk, then our cinema as an art is doomed. A picture is better than a thousand words, says an old Chinese proverb. How they true this is when applied to a really good film.
Foreign influences
Finally and most important of all is that the future of our industry will depend on the extent to which we use the stories which are rooted in our own soil; stories which portray our own people, their hopes, their fears and aspirations and in our own beautiful landscapes and settings. Our film can never be called truly Sinhalese until all the pernicious foreign influences which have dominated them are ruthlessly stamped out. This would imply a revolution, in almost all departments of picture-making, in acting, makeup, costumes, sets and music. Will our future films take this new direction Here again, our producers alone can answer the question.
What of the future At the moment the future looks bleak enough. There are so many more problems not touched on in this article which will beset us for many years. There is the position of the independent producer who will be forced to extinction unless a more equitable percentage of the box office receipts is given to his product. Government help and interest are vital at this stage if the industry is to be stable. An alert press is indispensable and here one can pay a tribute to the local press and critics who have never hesitated to expose the sham and the humbug and have really paved the way for better films.
But in the last resort the future of our industry lies not with the press who can only help and guide nor, I make bold to say, with the public. It is with the producers who make our pictures. What is their attitude going to be Are they going to be perpetually bullied by the demands of the Gallery Will they give the public what it wants or what is good for them For on their answer to these questions will depend not only the future of our industry but also the destiny of the Sinhala Cinema.

Worlds oldest mans secret to longevity
The worlds oldest man has been named as 112-year-old Masazo Nonaka, whose secret to longevity is said to be eating sweets and taking hot baths.
Born on 25 July 1905, months before Albert Einstein published his theory of special relativity, Nonaka lives with his family who run a hot springs inn on Japans northern island of Hokkaido.
The supercentenarian, whose exact age is 112 years 259 days, married his wife Hatsuno in 1931 and the couple had five children.
Nonaka has taken the Guinness World Records title as the oldest man on Earth after Spaniard Francisco Nunez Olivera died in February aged 113.
Receiving his certificate, Nonaka, wearing a knit cap and a kimono-style jacket, flashed a smile and posed for a group photo with his family, making a victory sign with his right hand.
He dug into a cake bought for the celebration and said it was delicious.
His granddaughter Yuko Nonaka said: He needs a wheelchair to move but he is in good condition. He loves eating any kinds of sweets - Japanese or western style. He reads newspapers every day and often soaks in the hot springs.
Guinness World Records is currently investigating possible contenders for the title of oldest living person as no one has been recognised since Violet Brown from Jamaica died in July 2017, aged 117.
Japan is well-known for the longevity of its people and has been home to several oldest title holders, including Jiroemon Kimura, who died in June 2013 at the age of 116.
The country boasts around 68,000 people aged 100 or older, the Japanese government said in 2017.

World Malaria Day falls today
World Malaria Day falls today (Wednesday). Sri Lanka received Malaria free status six years.
The Anti Malaria Campaign of the Health Ministry invites all Sri Lankans to support the national endeavor of keeping the country free of malaria, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the health authorities, Sri Lanka eliminated Malaria in 2016 and the World Health Organisation certified Sri Lanka as a Malaria free country. However, Sri Lanka is constantly is vulnerable of being affected by Malaria due to the large number of people traveling to and from countries having malaria and due to the prevalence of Malaria spreading mosquitoes in the country.
Around 50 cases of Malaria are reported annually here as a result of Sri Lankans travelling to countries afflicted with the disease. If these cases of imported Malaria are not detected early and treated promptly, there is an enormous risk of Sri Lanka facing a Malaria epidemic.
There were 41 and 57 imported Malaria cases in 2016 and 2017 respectively,Health Ministry sources said.
Sri Lankans travelling to India, Madagascar, Mozambique, military personnel returning from UN Peace-Keeping missions in the African region and the returnees from South India resettling in the Northern and Eastern areas are at high risk of getting infected with Malaria. Foreigners and workers arriving from Malaria endemic countries, including refugees from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Myanmar are also at risk of spreading Malaria in Sri Lanka.

Htota Port project a success
Both China and Sri Lanka have benefited from World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the global trade rules, which have contributed to Chinas reform and opening up and also making Sri Lanka a jewel in the Indian Ocean, said the Ambassador of China to Sri Lanka, Cheng Xuetuan.
Upholding economic globalization will bring a brighter future to the world. Sri Lanka, with its unique geographical location, has always been actively participating in economic globalization. As long as it adheres to trade liberalization and economic globalization, Sri Lankas great dream of becoming an important economic center in Asia would surely be realized in coming years. Under the guidance of the important consensus reached by the leaders of our two countries, the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, and the tide of economic globalization, Sino-Sri Lanka pragmatic cooperation have developed rapidly, he said.
The Ambassador said that the comprehensive development project of the Hambantota Port has proceeded smoothly and Sri Lanka has added a new important portal to the outside world. The construction of the Port City Colombo is steadily progressing day by day, on which many overseas investors have shown strong interest.
The Economic Corridors of Colombo-Hambantota, Colombo-Kandy (Spelled out by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinge) are also set to flourish. With all these collaborative efforts, economic development of the island nation is expected to embark on the fast track.
China is willing to work together with all countries, including Sri Lanka, to safeguard the multilateral trading system, promote further development of economic globalization, build a new form of international relations and a community of shared destiny, so as to bring greater welfare and brighter future to the people of the world. Commenting on the global business arena he said that since March 2018, the US Trump administration has unilaterally adopted a number of trade protection measures, which might trigger a global trade war that would affect the whole world.
These dangerous measures of unilateralism and protectionism are very likely to seriously damage the global economy that is undergoing a difficult recovery, impacting on everyone, in one way or the other.
Facing the US Trump administrations attempt to unilaterally wage a trade war against China, Beijing has taken firm countermeasures in the first place.
Chinas position on this issue is very clear: It neither wants a trade war nor willing to fight a trade war. But if a country insists to provoke one, China will follow suit to the very end, taking all necessary measures to defend its rights and interests, and safeguard the rules-based international trading system.

WELIKADA PRISON RIOT CASE
Arrest of real perpetrators imminent
Colombo additional Magistrate Ranga Dissanayaka yesterday observed that the real perpetrators involved in the killing of 27 prisoners at Welikada in 2012, should be arrested immediately.
He said the inquiry into the deaths suggested that inmates had died after being shot in their heads and chests. The Additional Magistrate said it was revealed through the post-mortem reports that the victims had died after being shot in their heads and chests.
The Additional Magistrate made this remark in response to a request made by aggrieved party lawyer Senaka Perera.He queried as to who had ordered the security forces to enter the Welikada prison.
Counsel Senaka Perera informed court that the security forces had entered the prison without obtaining a search warrant and the CID should conduct an inquiry as to who had influenced them to do so.
The Magistrate observed that counsel for the aggrieved party was making a request in terms of Section 124 of the Criminal Procedure Code and ordered the CID to investigate regarding the persons who conspired to commit the alleged offence.
Meanwhile, Inspector Neomal Rangajeewa of the Police Narcotics Bureau and former Prisons Commissioner Emil Ranjan Lamahewa were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till May 8 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake in connection with the Welikada prison riot in 2012.
Senior State Counsel Madhawa Thennakoon who appeared on behalf of the CID stated that a special investigation unit had commenced investigations regarding the death threats allegedly received by the wife of the main witness in the Welikada prison riot case.
The lawyers who appeared on behalf of the aggrieved party sought an order directing the CID to investigate the high ranking police officers who ordered them to enter the prison.
Colombo Additional Magistrate ordered the Prison superintendent to refer the Suspects to a psychiatrist through the Judicial Medical Officer.
The Additional Magistrate also ordered the CID to expedite investigations. Inspector Neomal Rangajeewa of the Police Narcotics Bureau and Prison Commissioner Emil Ranjan Lamahewa were arrested by the CID on March 28 in connection with the Welikada prison riot shooting.
Twenty-seven inmates were killed and more than 20 others injured in the shooting during the riot on November 9, 2012 when prisoners took control of the populated prison objecting to an unannounced search by the Special Task Force to nab hidden arms, drugs and mobile phones at the prison.
The Colombo Additional Magistrate fixed the case for May 8.

Book Review: Nostalgic look at a faraway city
Diaspora Theory with its various features has influenced the literature of every language of the world. This literature is widely known as Expatriate or Diasporic Literature. It would be proper to examine features and aspects of such literature in which Sri Lankan writing in English not only contributed greatly but also received international recognition and admiration in the past few years.
Diasporic Literature is an umbrella term that includes in it all those literary works written by the authors outside their native country, but these works are associated with native culture and background. In this wide context, all those writers can be regarded as diasporic writers, who write outside their country but remained related to their homeland through their works. Diasporic literature has its roots in the sense of loss and alienation, which emerged as a result of migration and expatriation.
Generally, diasporic literature deals with alienation, displacement, existential rootlessness, nostalgia, the quest for identity. It also addresses issues related to amalgamation or disintegration of cultures. It reflects the immigrant experience that comes out of the immigrant settlement.
The title of the second book by Charlotte Perera, Its the Same Moon, leads us to basic elements of diasporic literature, though it has not been essentially written by a diasporic author. Perera does not belong to the school of diasporic literature. But she bridges the diaspora community and their relatives. A major issue that most expatriates may feel when they are out of their home country is being marginalised  though this cannot be generalised. They feel the gravity of marginalisation when they return to their motherland where they feel more belonged.
Writing comes naturally to Perera. She does not seem to struggle with the art like most Sri Lankan English writers. Writing in English is a struggle for most Sri Lankan authors not exactly because of a fault of their own. The language does not have grounds to grow up. Because English is not a language of link, the language is lagging behind. Compared to the Sinhalese literature, both English and Tamil literature are at a disadvantage. Thankfully, the phenomenon is getting better than it used to be. All the same, the growth is not fast-paced.
It is the writing style that makes this book a frontrunner. The story unfolds through the eyes of an unseen protagonist. Though the book is about a certain remote area of Sri Lanka, the author brings in complex topics with ease into the storyline. Just as it should be, since humans are capable of thoughtful participation in everyday complexities, in their homes or other environments.
One salient feature of Pereras novel is that it is proof-read well, unlike most English novels published in the country. Although the language at times may seem a tad formal, Perera is quite composed in her lyrical style of writing. She deserves kudos, for not many authors are blessed with such a talent.
Pereras is one of those books you read when you're looking for something to challenge your brain a little bit and give you a break from story-driven novels. Something that as it progresses tends to wax philosophical while losing all semblance of following a structure and being character driven. Something that makes you feel a little smarter for a moment before making you wish there was something a little bit deeper there.
Nostalgia takes place in a place where mankind has seemingly discovered immortality. As humans live longer and longer, they take on more and more mental baggage. Rather than live for decades with painful memories, humans have parts of their minds erased and replaced with fictional, more pleasant histories.
Certain passages may not be much of a warm read. If we hasten to call this nostalgic novel, then it could be less hardcore than most of what we come across in the western sphere from this genre. It is close enough to nostalgia that you could relate to it, absorb its questions and ponder it still after you close the covers.
This could be considered more as a non-autobiographical memoir. The writers thoughts on faith (in the general more than religious sense) emerge as the antithesis to a stern sense of nostalgia. Perhaps this goes a long way to explain the strife in today's world.
Life at Dullawa Walawwa or The Mansion was changing slowly. Harin baby was five years old and he was admitted to a private English school. Madhuris ayah always went up and down with the child in a car. Chathura was very fond of the child who always reminded him of his beloved friend Haritha. The child too adored Chathura Mama, because he didnt feel the absence of a father as Chathura did everything to look after the boy. Madhuri was still weeping for her husband. What she couldnt bear was the uncertainty.
Its the Same Moon is an evocative title; Sri Lanka, its remote areas and somewhere distant as London and many other faraway cities, they all come together as a tapestry, as Perera describes Anuradhapura. The book brings up the same evocative sense mixed with a fair bit of nostalgia.
Storytelling is an art that makes the readers think and respect their own intellect. Charlotte Perera succeeds in this aspect. The book happily mixes travel writing with storytelling.
Excellent writing, especially because of its lyrical rendering, but in certain chapters, the story misses the magic spirit that makes speculative fiction sparkle.

Cabinet Paper clears confusion over energy policy
Confusion over the energy policy of the government was cleared yesterday, with a Cabinet Paper seeking to approve the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energys policy on the matter.
Ministry Secretary Suren Batagoda speaking to the Daily News said approval was granted for their paper which proposed that all energy sources be included in the energy mix of the country.
This includes the controversial coal option. The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) in its approval of the 2018-2037 plan, had removed all new coal plants from the mix stating that the governments policy was to move away from coal.
They approved an energy mix of 60 percent renewable: 20 percent coal (existing) and 20 percent LNG.
We have stated that there should be an energy mix with all energy varieties, even nuclear. We cannot rule out any. So we proposed that the first option be given to renewable (the maximum technically feasible), second priority to local energy sources (such as the gas in the Mannar basin) and the rest be filled with other fossil fuels such as coal and other fuel sources such as biomass and nuclear, said Batagoda.
He insisted that this was the energy policy of the government after all and that this was merely a reinforcement of that.
In 2016, President Sirisena cancelled the Sampur power plant and asked that the Indian government turn the proposal into a LNG power plant instead. The President had pointed out that there was great local opposition to coal power plants in the country.
Since then however there has been a war of ideas between the CEB and PUCSL over including new coal power plants or not in the energy mix. The former refusing to budge from the old ways whilst the latter has pointed out that the country would be taken to another energy crisis if we wait another 20 years for a coal power plant to materialize. Sampur was cancelled after 10 years of negotiations.

Call to protect free education system
The Government is now trying its best to tarnish the international recognition won by the Sir John Kotelawala Defence University and destroy this reputed state institution along with the countrys free education system, State Medical Students Parents Union Media Spokesman Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing a press conference at the Organisation of Professionals Association (OPA) in Colombo yesterday,Alwis alleged the Government has already handed over the task of privatising Sri Lankas free education system to seven Armed Forces officils.
The Armed Forces are there to safeguard the country and not to privatise free education, Alwis said.
According to Alwis, the proposed Sir John Kotelawala Defence University Act (drafted in 2017) to be introduced in Parliament soon <U+200B>will completely destroy the future of our children.
It would give power to accept any low quality degree offered by any low quality university/institution in the world, such as, SAITM which is illegal and fraudulent,he alleged.
It also overpowers the Sri Lanka Medical Council and similar professional regulatory bodies, Alwis added.
The Government should not use helpless SAITM students to privatise Sri Lankas free education system. The Government should direct SAITM students to recognised foreign universities if possible to solve the issue. The authorities should take over SAITM or hand over its properties to the proposed State Medical Faculty of the Moratuwa University. Otherwise, the parents union will join hands with all other anti SAITM and anti Government organisations and launch an island wide campaign, he added.

CB raises USD 2.5 bn from offshore bond offering
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), on behalf of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, successfully launched and raised USD 2.5 billion in a dual-tranche 5 and 10 year bond.
The transaction was the twelfth US Dollar benchmark offering in the international bond markets by Sri Lanka since 2007, and its largest offshore bond offering ever, outlining Sri Lankas position as a key Asian Sovereign issuer. HSBC acted in the capacity of Joint Lead Manager, Bookrunner and Ratings Advisor to the Government of Sri Lanka for this bond issuance.
The size of the new 5 year bond was USD 1.25 billion with a coupon of 5.75% p.a., whilst the size of the new 10 year bond was USD 1.25 billion with a coupon of 6.75 p.a.
The final order books stood at USD 3 billion across over 235 accounts and USD 3.5 billion across over 190 accounts for the 5 and 10 year issuances respectively.
The strong interest shown from a wide range of high quality investors across the US, Europe and Asia, allowed the Sovereign to tighten price guidance by 25 bps each across both tranches, confirming its position as a premier issuer in the capital market.
Mark Prothero, CEO HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives said, The sovereign announced a dual tranche offering on April 11, 2018, and once again displayed its savviness to remain nimble and responsive to market conditions and successfully capturing a stable market window.
This transaction signals the continued confidence placed by the international investor community in the countrys strong credit and growth story.

Comparing local polls to national, a grave mistake
To compare local elections to national elections is a grave mistake, Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya yesterday said.
If someone assumes that winning a local election will ensure easy passage at a national level poll they may be in for a rude shock, Deshapriya said.
He said there were several instances in history where the opposition has secured easy victory in local elections against the government in office and also instances where these victories have been reversed in a short period of time.
The Elections Commission chairman said no one can assume they had the power to topple a government in office, just by winning a local election.
Speaking further, Deshapriya said that another myth popular among the public is that all provincial and local government elections should be held on a same date.
No country in this world holds their provincial or local government elections on the same date.
There is no requirement to hold local elections on the same date. he said speaking to the media at the Election Commission premises yesterday. When we were young, the local elections were held separately in each urban council, town council and village council. There was less interest on those local elections. Even the party leaders didnt participate in these election campaigns. Now they are comparing these local elections to national elections, while demanding them to be held on the same day, Deshapriya pointed out.

Corrupt officials hampering drug bust - IGP
Preventing underworld drug kingpins operating from within the prison is a huge challenge due to limited resources and Prisons Department staff, Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara said.
Addressing the media yesterday he said in some of these high profile cases, the police officers are helpless when pressure is brought on them by higher authorities with regard to some of the high profile cases.
Although the police have arrested several drug kingpins and put them behind bars, there still does not seem to be a reduction in drug smuggling and peddling network. There are allegations that most of these drug lords operate their networks even while behind bars, through mobile phones.
When asked about this situation, the IG said that while on one hand the police do their job, there is always another set of institutions and persons that assist these criminals simply for monetary advantages and privileges.
The first stage is to enforce the law pertaining to those within Sri Lanka who assist these drug lords. During the past few weeks, the local associates of such underworld drug kingpins have been arrested and imprisoned. Drugs and weapons in their possession were also seized. The second stage is to arrest the main underworld leaders who are absconding in other countries, the Police Spokesman said.
Responding to a query raised by the media as to why the use of mobile phones cannot be prevented within the Welikada prison, as has been done at the Mahara prison, the IGP said they had tried jamming at Welikada prison, but criminals had found ways to creep through them.
He noted that there are also issues with regard to transporting these prisoners etc from far out prisons. However, the IG added that they are working on methods of overcoming these obstacles and finding viable solutions to these issues.

Coup detat III, aborted on January 9, 2015
The January 8 revolution was sparked by a remarkably provoked electorate that effectively challenged the Rajapaksas repressive regime.
There had been a holdup in the release of the election results in the wee hours of January 9 morning. Unconfirmed reports stated that announcement of results had been suspended until further notice. Rumours doing rounds said that there had been some STF men rounding the D.S. Senanayake College counting centre. Did they hatch a conspiracy to subvert the declaration of the presidential election results if President Mahinda Rajapaksa was losing Was there a plan to seize power after creating an emergency situation on the pretext of that there had been violence in the country.
However, later it was revealed that everything was normal there and that there had been no order from the Commissioner to postpone the announcement of election results, but only a short break was allowed to the staff. Unofficial information confirmed that Maithripala Sirisena was winning the elections; and when the official election results were announced finally, Maithripala Sirisena had won comfortably by over 400,000 votes.
The alleged coup attempt by Mahinda Rajapaksa was the talk of the town. People were curious, rumour mongers had a field day and gave different interpretations questioning as to why the outgoing Rajapaksa had summoned the Chief Justice Mohan Peiris, the IGP and the three Service Commanders and the Attorney General to Temple Trees. What were they doing at Temple Trees while the results were being announced The perception of the majority was that President Rajapaksa had conspired to disrespect the verdict of the voter and continue to run the state under a military junta headed by him. In the meantime, social media websites went to town highlighting various stories about the suspected coup attempt. Details of the entire plan of the government; names of high-ranking officers in important places, military officers, who had been given orders to surround strategic locations in the city with their armed guards were divulged through these websites.
Final outcome
Three-fourths of the results are already released, and half of the balance unofficially leaked out and picked up by his agents, the President was certain about the final outcome when he decided to speak to Ranil Wickremesinghe around 3.00 am. With confidential reports receiving, especially that of Nuwara-Eliya where the government had lost by such a massive majority, it became obvious that Rajapaksa was heading for a rout.
President Rajapaksa had told Wickremesinghe that he wished to abdicate even before the final result was issued, as it was quite evident that informal declaration of results proved that the margin was too big to match. MR wanted Wickremesinghe to rush to Temple Trees and take over responsibilities until official oath taking by the Winner, and also arrange a helicopter for him to fly to his hometown in Tangalle. According to social media, the government had decided to put into action an alternative plan which it devised well ahead of Election so that they could continue to stay in power. Commandos had been sent to the office of Election Commissioner to throw them out and take over the office, but the Army Commander and Attorney General had refused to carry out illegal orders in spite of CJ Mohan Peiris who had been backing the President had stated the order was legal.
Then, according to other rumour mongers, the opposition had got into action and dispatched Ranil Wicremesinghe to Temple Trees thus averting a conspiracy to set up an undemocratic form of a junta. After the new president was sworn in, the state media made a big hue and cry about the conspiracy by the Rajapaksas. Lies and half-truths, evidence full of gossip and hearsay went down well with the public as the truth. Minister, Mangala Samaraweera made a complaint to the IGP, which was forwarded to the CID for investigation. Allegations were levelled mainly against Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the former Defence Secretary. The police commenced investigations by interrogating most of the politicians present at Temple Trees on that fateful morning when the alleged coup was hatched. CID sleuths recording statements from witnesses that were present at TT, that included the Chief Justice and Attorney General, they found everybody just denying any knowledge of a conspiracy.
The Inspector General of Police and the Commissioner of Elections had in fact totally denied allegations of an attempted coup detat that had been spread by numerous social media websites along with some electronic and print media. No arrests were made, as the independent team of investigators could not find an iota of evidence to implicate any of the Rajapaksa brothers or their close alleys in the former regime. CID closed the case.
Real coup and Fax Pas in the past
56 years ago on January 27, 1962, the IGP was relaxing at the Orient Club, Colombo, when the director, CID, S. A. Dissanayake called him with the disturbing news that a Coup detat had been designed to overthrow the SLFP government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike exactly that night. Dissanayake further informed the IGP that the conspirators included certain senior police and military officers. The operation was codenamed Holdfast.
The IGP immediately called the Superintendent of Police Stanley Senanayake to the Orient Club. During this emergency meeting, Senanayake confirmed information that such a coup was being planned.
Democratically elected govt.
Abeykoon and Senanayake decided the matter had to be brought to the immediate notice of Deputy Defence Minister Felix Dias Bandaranaike; thus averted the only recorded Coup against a democratically elected government. 11 conspirators were found guilty and sentenced, to be rescued by Privy Council.
The other Coup can be described as a wretched attempt by J R Jayewardene in 1966, the State Minister in the Dudley Senanayake government of 1965. The objective of this exercise presumably was either to block the rapid transformation of religious power within the Army in favour of Buddhist officers or the suspicion that was growing over the politically backed recruitments and promotions initiated through the commander, Richard Udugama who was a relative of Bandaranaikes.
The well-known Buddhist monk, Ven Henpitagedara Gnanaseeha Maha Nayaka Thera had been a staunch supporter of the Bandaranaikes. He was accused as number one conspirator along with a team of lower ranked petty army men the highest being a captain. Bathroom coup was the name coined by the scribes of the day to denote the alleged coup in 1966.
The UNP government made maximum to fix a few officers, who, they believed were antagonistic towards them. The Army Commander Major General Richard Udugama, a relative of Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the Leader of Opposition and ex-CCS officer, N Q Dias, who served as Secretary to Ministry of Defence were the only men of some standing that were taken in for questioning.
In the absence of Prime Minister, Dudley Senanayake, the acting head of Cabinet and State Minister J R Jayewardene handled the matter by appointing a team of hand-picked Policemen with instructions to fabricate evidence by hook or by crook. These unsatisfactory features in the evidence of each of the officers of the interrogating team do not enable us to accept with confidence their evidence as to the reasons for the somersault of the 7th accused who had on more than one earlier occasion been unsuccessfully interrogated.- [excerpts from judgement]
The whole episode proved to be a faux pas; all accused were acquitted by the Trial at Bar, as the jury unanimously declared them not guilty.

Drugs is a major issue that plagues the country with around 63 percent of drugs coming into the country through various harbours and 25 percent being smuggled through the southern and western sea areas, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said.
The drug trade and underworld go hand in hand and one cannot be resolved without the other being addressed, the Minister said.
Minister Badduma Bandara speaking at a press conference yesterdaym, urged journalists not to idolise criminals through the media. Sometimes the media highlights these criminals and portray them as heroes or victims, while making the Police look like villains. I therefore urge the media to report these cases in a responsible manner by helping the Police control and enforce law and order in the country, he said.
He noted that some police officers are facing threats to their lives having been involved in such high profile cases.
However,IGP Pujith Jayasundara said he has taken all measures to ensure the safety of such Police officers and their families.
He said that it is the duty of the Police Department to guarantee the safety of their officers, so that they can perform their duties without the fear of being targets of these criminals.

Extradition of Mahendran, Weeratunge, a timely process - Police Spokesman
Sri Lanka has an extradition treaty with Singapore and it is possible to get former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran extradited, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
However, Gunasekara said that just because a Red Notice was obtained, Mahendran could not be brought back in a day. It is a process and working through this process takes time.
With regard to former Ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunge, IGP Pujith Jayasundara said Weeratunge was arrested in Dubai over an issue that took place in that country.
Our investigations locally, is a separate issue where he is being investigated over his transactions during the time he served as the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia. Although we have evidence against him, we need to get him back in order to get a statement from him. Interpol has certain agreements with each country. Initially, a Blue Notice was issued against Weeratunga and later we presented the evidence against him (Weeratunga) to Interpol and obtained a Red Notice, he said.
However, the FCID had earlier noted that Udayanga Weeratunga was arrested by the Dubai authorities based on their investigations. But, the IGP said that he was arrested over an issue pertaining to the violation of Dubai laws.
But, although he is wanted in Sri Lanka, Dubai should have a reason to send him here. Therefore, it is up the Dubai authorities to decide whether they would agree to extradite him or not. We cannot force them, but are still negotiating with them for Weeratungas return, the IGP said.

Forum held to resolve lubricant industrial issues
A special forum was convened by the Public Utility Commission to address the issues faced by the lubricant industry in the country. The forum, Public Consultation on Lubricant Industry, was held at BMICH yesterday with the participation of over 300 people.
Many speakers spoke about the hardships and the difficulties faced by the industry whereas other environmentalists and officials from quality assessment authorities stressed on the high levels of pollution caused by unethical practices of the lubricant industry.
Although the market is liberalised, an authorization is required to import, export, blend, produce, distribute, supply or sell lubricants in the country.
The necessity of having an effective and independent mechanism for ensuring product quality, fair prices and protecting the interests of consumers and market players have increased. Thats why the PUSL decided to hold a public consultation on issues related to the issues to advice the government on remedial measures, PUCSL Director General Damitha Kumarasingha said.
The lubricant market comprises lubricants and greases derived from mineral oil or synthesized from chemical compounds for automotive, industrial and marine applications. The lubricant marketplace is primarily regulated under the Ceylon Petroleum Cooperation Act No 28 of 1961 by the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry.
Sri Lanka boasts 13 market players and 22 authorised lubricant brands. (FJ)

The guardstone miracle
Ancient Sri Lankan architectural patterns, Hindu temple structure, cultural chambers, sculpture and paintings resemble those of South Indian temples. Despite such similarities, Sri Lanka preserves its own identity. Ancient historical sites of Sri Lanka play an important role in society. The buildings were not built for general purposes. They were considered as community development centres. The construction of worshipping places has its own patterns and plans which resemble their own culture, customs, regional and religious influences of different periods. Besides, construction patterns of each worshipping place and region provide ample evidence of the rulers taste. They built temples with their own involvement in art, culture, tradition and religion.
Different categories
Ancient Indian rulers were deeply involved in culture and traditions. Different rulers built temples and cultural chambers throughout the Indian sub-continent. That also influenced the neighbouring Sri Lanka where temple architecture and sculptures constructed during various periods reveal different styles of social and cultural influences.
Most of the sculptures are divided into different categories. These sculptures are long-lasting. Yet the longstanding metal sculptures are not durable like the ancient temple sculptures which were made out of granite.
In the Hindu temple structures, at the entrance, the two guards are always installed. In the Sri Lankan archaeological sites beautiful guard stones are installed. The guard stones are found at the entrance of the important and sacred places such as Buddhist temples. Earlier guard stones were installed at royal palaces, important royal courts, water reservoirs and cultural chambers. In Sri Lanka, a variety of guard stones is found at different archaeological sites.
They are in standing postures with a curved body and different foot positions. All these resemble the classical dance stand poses and postures. In technical terms, the stands of dance and body positions are often referred to as Mandala Isthana positions.
Dance costumes
The hood of the guard stone is more often covered with multi-headed cobras. Such guard stones were often found at the entrance of water reservoirs, royal palaces and places where the treasures were buried. The multi-headed Naga king is called Naga Raja. The guard stones are highly decorated with beautiful ornaments and layers of waist chains. The costumes of the guard stones resemble the beautiful dance costumes. Besides, beautiful ear and chest ornaments and highly crafted head crowns are worn by the sculptures. They show a close resemblance to Hindu temple and tower sculptures.
One hand of the guard stone carries Punkalasa (a pot) and the other hand holds a bunch of buds and flowers. In some places, we see only Naga Raja guard stones. With the passage of time, Bahirawa was added to Naga Raja guard stones. Bahirawa was added to protect wealth. Sankha and Padma the two Ganas (Yakas) were installed at the feet of Naga Raja.
Beautiful Naga Raja stones could be found in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. Heads of the Naga Raja were decorated with exclusive beautiful ornaments. Over some guard stones, Makaras heads were installed. At the base of the arch, lion and dancing human figures were depicted. These imply the close links of dance with Sri Lankan archaeological guard sculptures.
Earlier villagers performed poojas to the Yakas to protect their family and wealth. It was believed that the two Ganas or Yakas were employed by the God of wealth Kubera to protect the wealth. In some guard stones, we find a coin chain. In dance Kasumalai of gold sovereigns is worn around the neck.

Haiku productivity
A decade ago, I wrote about Haiku Productivity and how limits can make us more productive, more focused, and better able to prioritize and simplify.
The idea comes from haiku poetry, in which the poet is limited to three lines and (essentially) 17 syllables. Such a crazy limit, and yet the poetry that can be produced is often very powerful.
The secret: the poet is forced to choose, forced to simplify, forced to find the essence of the message. The constraints are actually a very powerful thing, because constraints force you to be disciplined, to understand that because you have limits, every element in the container must be important, and you cant just waste words.
Over the years, I would often lose sight of this wisdom, but I keep coming back to it: when a container is unlimited, youll just fill it with anything. When you have constraints, youll be more careful, be more appreciative of the limited space you have, and explore whats important to you in more depth.
This applies to every area of life, including:
Productive time: If you have a long list of things to do, and the entire work week to do them, it doesnt feel that urgent, and you often fill your days with little things  answering emails, messages, group chats, or reading things online. But what if you only had an hour a day, and you had one really important project Youd be more more focused. More on this below.
Clutter: If you only allow yourself to have 33 items of clothing for each season, you will be more conscious about what clothes you have in your life. This is true of any possessions: a smaller home means you are forced to choose. A limit on how many books you have makes you pick those that are dearer to you, and those you think you can actually read.
Projects: Its easy to say yes to new work or personal projects, and then suddenly your life becomes overfull and youre not doing a good job with any of the projects. What if you forced yourself to pick just one Or two How would that change the way you worked You might find more focus and fewer complications, and do an amazing job with each project.
People in our lives: Some of us keep adding new relationships, making new connections (other people have the opposite problem, not actively seeking relationships, but thats not the topic of this post)  making new relationships is a beautiful thing, but when we realize that we only have a limited amount of time to create deep relationships, its worth thinking about who we want to spend our limited time with, and curate our relationships.
Life itself: Life is limited. We all know this, and yet we act as if we have an unlimited supply of life, and we can use it up however we want. We fritter away our days on little things, not really appreciating the miracle of each moment, not really taking advantage of the incredible opportunity of each day. What if we saw each day as precious, and made the absolute most of it
The list could go on much further, but what I really want to talk about today is the power of limits in increasing our focus on the meaningful work we really want to do  whether thats creating art, creating a new business, creating happiness in our team or customers, or working on something meaningful in our personal lives.

Heartbrok14en cat walks 12 miles to find his family
When Toby the cat was taken away from his home, he really missed his family. He missed them so much he left his new home and walked 12 miles to try and track them down.
But when he finally arrived his family was far from happy to see him. They had given him away because they no longer wanted him, so they couldnt believe it when he turned up on their doorstep.
Tobys commitment to finding them wasnt enough to change their minds so they took him to a shelter and asked staff to put him down. Luckily, the shelter contacted a nearby animal charity and explained what had happened.
The SPCA animal shelter in North Carolina agreed to take him in and shared his incredible story on social media.
They wrote: When Tobys family no longer wanted him, they gave him to another family. But Toby missed them, and walked 12 miles back to his home. When he arrived, he was met with heartbreak. The family he thought had loved him took him to a shelter and asked staff to euthanize him. The shelter called us at the SPCA to ask if we could take him in and help him find a new family. Of course we said YES!
Tobys story has since been shared thousands of times by people across the world. And all the publicity has had a fantastic result, as he has a new home. He was adopted by Michele, who lives in New Hampshire.
Hes settling into his new home, which he shared with his two new cat brothers.

JVP to introduce 20th Amendment in May as private members bill

JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake plans to introduce a 20th amendment to the Constitution, as a private members bill in May, seeking to completely abolish the executive presidency.
Many country leaders such as President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickrememsinghe, and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa pledged to eliminate the executive presidency in the past.
But Dissanayake asserted in March of this year that he believed neither the UNP nor President Maithripala Sirisena ever intended to actually elimination the position.
The office of the President was created in 1972 as a ceremonial position but was only endowed with executive powers in the 1978 Constitution introduced by J.R. Jayewardene.

Karaoke lounge fire kills 18 in China
CHINA: A fire tore through a karaoke lounge in southern China on Tuesday, killing 18 people and injuring another five, as authorities arrested an arson suspect who had reportedly blocked the entrance with a motorcycle.
The fire started after midnight in a three-storey building in Yingde, Guangdong province, and was put out shortly before 1:00 am local time, according to the police.
A preliminary investigation found that it was caused by arson, the public security department in Qingyuan city, which oversees Yingde, said on its Weibo social media account.
The suspect got into an argument, then used a motorcycle to block the buildings door and lit the fire, state broadcaster CCTV said, adding that he was on the lam.
Police said the suspect was captured in a village district, shortly after authorities offered a 200,000 yuan ($32,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of a man identified as a 32-year-old with burn marks on his hips.
The official Xinhua news agency, citing the city government, said the suspect, identified as Liu Chunlu, confessed after he was arrested at his home.
I was drunk last night and had had a fight with unknown people (before the fire), Liu told police, according to Xinhua.
The police statement did not describe the location of the fire but state media said it occurred in a small KTV house, or karaoke lounge.
Unverified videos from the scene posted by local media show flames leaping from the building on a tree-lined street at night, with fire trucks and a crowd of onlookers on the road.
The five injured people are receiving treatment in a hospital, state TV said.
Karaoke is a popular activity in China, with even shopping centres featuring booths where people can sit and sing their favourite songs.
Larger KTV lounges proliferate as well, often spanning across multiple floors in a building, with narrow corridors linking dozens of individual rooms together.
The lounge where the fire occurred was smaller, with only one corridor for entry and exit, state TV said. Merrymakers often go for a buffet dinner and sing and drink with a small group of friends in the private rooms late into the night.
Deadly fires are common in China, where safety regulations are widely flouted and enforcement is often lax.
A blaze that killed 38 people at a nursing home in 2015 sparked soul-searching about safety standards in China. Courts jailed 21 people, including firefighters and government staff, over the fire.
The legal representative of the Kangleyuan Nursing Home was sentenced to nine years in prison for constructing an illegal extension to the property, while the contractor was given a six-year sentence for using flammable materials to build an extension. - AFP

Lankan with forged travel documents arrested at BIA
A Sri Lankan who tried to leave for Ireland with the falsified documents of a merchant sailor was arrested by the Department of Immigration and Emigration at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA)yesterday.
The suspect, a resident of Jaffna had arrived at the airport with the plan to initially fly to Singapore SriLankan Airlines flight UL 308.
Identified as Alfred Edison, he had approached Immigration and Emigration Officer S.A.M.S.R.Maulana and questioned him about getting to his flight.
The officer whose suspicions were aroused by this line of questioning had directed him to the Chief Immigration and Emigration Officer C.M. Munasinghe.
Munasinghe informed the media that when the suspect was further questioned, his answers were not satisfactory and thus they had proceeded to inspect his belongings. During their first search, they had found a medical certificate and various other documents but on conducting a second inspection, they were able to uncover other documents which had been cleverly hidden inside the bag.
A merchant sailor is allowed to enter in country by law and the officers were able to find false documents issued by the Sri Lankan government certifying him as a merchant sailor, a naval service record book containing details of his professional career, other false naval documents and a letter of employment from an Irish shipping company.
Upon further questioning, the suspect had revealed that he had falsified these documents to travel to England via Singapore so he could join his uncle in England. From there, they had planned to go to Belfast in Ireland for a naval job there.
The officers had also found some naval certificates on him and the suspect had denied receiving any naval training to get them.
The suspect was later handed over to the Airport Crimes Investigation Department for further investigations.

Muthurajawela plant commission delay incurred loss to govt: Weerakkody
Former Minister Chandima Weerakkody charged that the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry has delayed the commissioning of the newly constructed lubricant blending plant in Muthurajawela for four months resulting in losses to the Government.
Taking subject Minister Arjuna Ranatunga to task, the former Minister said the prices of lubricant oil could have been reduced by 30 percent had this plant been commissioned last December. The former minister made this observation in reply to allegations against him over the construction of the lubricant plant without adhering to the proper procedure.
He was speaking at the SLFP press conference held at its headquarters yesterday, in the absence of Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, who was scheduled to address the press conference. It was constructed by a Malaysian Company under a Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) agreement at a cost of USD 18 million. It has a state-of-the-art technology but had been idling for the last four months.
Who is delaying its operations The current minister was responsible for a fuel crisis lately and soon he will also create a lubricant oil scarcity. He is catering to the motives of businessmen. The Ministry Secretary is simply a puppet, he accused.
He also charged that the Government opted for spot tenders to buy oil during the last few months instead of long-term tenders. He said had the Government purchased oil on long-term tenders, had the price formula been introduced much earlier and had the lubricant facility been opened without delay, the Government would not have had to increase oil prices. He stated that the 16 SLFP members, who supported the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister, will sit in the Opposition benches during the next Parliamentary sitting.
There is no change to this decision despite various media speculations in this regard.
All 16 of us will stay together and we remain in the SLFP under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena. We will sit in the opposition as an independent group, he said.

NTB launch Open API Banking Platform
Nations Trust Bank has launched a new era of banking with its Open API Banking Platform through which it is releasing a set of open APIs to the public so that trusted partner systems can directly integrate with Nations Trust Bank systems.
Essentially this means that, using Nations Open API Banking, clients can integrate the Banks services directly into their own systems and workflows.
The potential that Open API Banking has is unlimited, as it can be used by startups, large corporations, SMEs, independent app developers and even tech savvy individuals in their own businesses, day to day lives or when providing 3rd party solutions. Typical use case scenarios include ERP Automation, cash flow management, online purchases, fund transfers, payments, and white label services.
Commenting on the strategy, Renuka Fernando, Director/CEO, Nations Trust Bank said, The future of banking will be one of the safest public spaces, openness and inclusivity. This is why we have taken the initiative to launch Nations Open API Banking, creating a framework for collaborative innovation and progress like never seen before.

With Nations Open API Banking, we are joining what is becoming a global trend towards openness, collaboration and data sharing in the financial services industry.
Managing money across accounts at different banks will also be possible through a single access point of the customers choice in the future and the customer will be able to decide whether or not to share their information. In terms of security, Open Banking is as safe as internet banking or any other digital banking channel. In addition to this we have gone to extreme lengths to ensure that our APIs conform to the highest international standards, which at the moment happen to be Europes PSD2.

Opportunity, the best example Sujatha Vidyalaya
Head Girl of Sujatha Vidyalaya Matara Sewminie Wijesinghe has worked hard at developing her interpersonal skills. She is a woman of the 21st century and she has correctly understood that the ability to work alongside others is the key to success in any organization. Perfect Prefects features Wijesinghe a model citizen.
Wijesinghe has many targets in her life and certainly has the ability to achieve all of them due to her self- confidence and ability to focus on what is important.
I have many targets in life but I have one special target which is to be a lecturer in a University. I am doing my A/Ls in the Math stream doing Math, Physics and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). I would like to give to others what I have received in life mainly when it comes to education. I have received a very holistic education from my school, and I would like to help in making educational opportunities available to other children, said Wijesinghe.
Living harmoniously
One message she wants to give out is the need to work with others putting differences aside. She has not developed her interpersonal skills out of vanity. She has developed her interpersonal skills because she feels that there is a real need to be able to live harmoniously with others and work for the common good.
I would like to tell young people that they need to work with each other in unity. You need to understand how to work with each other. You have to comprehend the importance of working with each other. If we in Sri Lanka can work together the world will look on us favourably. We can take Sri Lanka to the world if we can work together. This will make us an example to other countries. Just think of what we can do if we can work together in harmony We can achieve our goals. We can develop this country. We can improve the quality of our life. We can achieve true peace. We can develop each and every facet of our lives. We can only develop our country if we are properly united. We need to work together at all levels in this country. Most importantly we need to cooperate in our workplaces, explained Wijesinghe.
Sujatha Vidyalaya Matara has provided her with the environment to develop qualities such as self- confidence and patience. Her training at this institute has given her the right motivation and encouragement so that when she steps out into the world outside, she will be able to hold her own and stand her ground. She will be able to say to herself that she gave it her 100 percent. In that sense, her growth at her Alma Mater has been carefully supervised and they have produced the ideal Head Girl who will always have a cool head.
When facing a difficult situation or problem in life what we need is Self-Confidence and Patience. Those qualities are important for a leader. We can face any challenge if we have self- confidence and through this, we can deal with whatever comes our way. If you take my school I have received so many opportunities and a platform for self- advancement. I have been in school from Grade 1. I am who I am because of my school. I have so many friends here and my teachers and principal have been a real inspiration. With all my extra-curricular activities they have helped me a lot, said Wijesinghe.
Indifferent high-ups
Wijesinghe said that poverty and hunger are also due to people not thinking of each other. People are poor because those in higher places are indifferent. But if we really want to eradicate poverty, we can do it. If we really want to.
Wijesinghe has taken part in activities at school and has developed an all-round personality. Because of this she actually can give back to society. One activity she has benefited from is guiding.
We can learn so much from guiding. We learn to be independent because we are away from our parents and we are not in our comfort zone. We have to work with girls who we may not know very well. We have to take part in so many activities so we are forced to interact with each other. This is hugely beneficial. It builds character. It helps you develop interpersonal skills, pointed out Wijesinghe.
Wijesinghe in addition to having interpersonal skills is indignant when it comes to the suffering of other living beings.
Understanding living beings
Very often these days on social media we come across many stories of barbarism towards humans and animals. Some people are unable to understand that the living being they are torturing is experiencing pain.
If you take society there seems to be a lack of compassion. I cannot agree with or condone what is happening in society. People only think about themselves. If we care about others that would make a big difference in life, said Wijesinghe.
Wijesinghe does not admire one particular leader. She believes in learning a lesson from all of them. Gandhi and Mother Teresa did so much good in their own different ways.
It is this combination of qualities that I take as an example. In this world, we all face so many difficulties. What matters here is the thinking power. You need a positive mindset and a positive attitude. You can overcome your struggles if you have courage, stated Wijesinghe.
Wijesinghe stated the information technology field is the future of any country. Information technology is something you cannot do without.
Technology-savvy
I am interested in this field and I try to learn something new in this field every day. The entire world depends on information technology. Society is moving with it as we speak. People now rely completely on information technology, said Wijesinghe.

Peoples needs should come first: Sajith
The sixth model village built in the Anuradhapura district was commissioned by Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa on April 23. The said model village, Swasthi Gama, consists of 25 houses and is located in the Ipalogana DS Division in Manewa.
Addressing the gathering following the inauguration ceremony, Minister Premadasa appealed to politicians both in the government and the Opposition, to put the needs of the people in the country such as the cost of living, unemployment, national integrity and peace first, before carrying out their private agendas.
''During the period between 2015 and 2017, new housing projects had been provided to 257,000 low-income families at cost of Rs. 164.2 million. In 2018, a sum of Rs. 12 million had been allocated for housing development programmers," he said.
The last regime had invested only Rs. 56.37 million in order to provide housing facilities to the public. The current government had invested Rs. 170.65 million to implement the
Housing for All development programme, the minister said, adding that out of 5,277,000 houses in the country, 2,500,000 houses require renovation, while 227,523 new houses are required to be constructed for the homeless.

Proposal to hold SLFP May Day rally in Batticaloa
It has been proposed to hold the SLFP May Day rally in Batticaloa, Ports Authority Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya President Prasanna Kalutarage said.
Speaking to the media at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said they are ready to join with the SLFP leader and President Maithripala Sirisena to hold a massive May Day rally in Batticaloa.
The idea to hold it in Batticaloa, where the SLFP won the recent Local Government elections, is yet to be approved, but we believe it is a good idea as it sends out a positive message for national unity, he said.
Representatives of Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya branches of Ports Authority, Peoples Bank, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Government Midwifery Service Association, who addressed the press conference, collectively said they do not agree to the decision by Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya General Secretary Leslie Devendra to be independent. It was an arbitrary decision of Secretary Devendra. Not even the President had been aware of this decision.
We have no reason to follow Devendra, and we firmly support the SLFP. We will attend the May Day rally of the SLFP on May 7, they said.
It is an illusion to think that the votes cast for SLPP are votes against the SLFP. People voted for the SLPP because they had no alternative, said Kalutarage.

Ready to hold PC elections in December - Deshapriya
The Election Commission will hold the Provincial Council Election in early December once the legal and constitutional hindrances to the process are swiftly resolved, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said yesterday.
He urged all political parties to take measures to hold the Provincial Council Election as soon as possible. Resolving the issues regarding the new electoral system will enable the Election Commission to call for provincial council election nominations in mid October for the Northern, Central, North-Western, Southern, Western and Eastern provinces, Deshapriya said.
He said the Election Commission has sent a special request letter to the secretaries of all political parties requesting them to be committed to hold the Provincial Council Election as soon as possible.
While requesting not to blame the Election Commission for any delay in holding elections, Deshapriya pointed out that there are four options available to Parliament to solve matters relating to the electoral system.
Firstly, parliament can approve the delimitation report as it is, with a two third majority. Secondly they can opt to revise the report by a committee appointed by the Prime Minister. If not, they can change the 50-50 ratio and prepare an early and speedy delimitation report again. Or they can go back to the previous preferential vote system. If parliament can decide on one of these four alternatives, we will be able to hold the Provincial Council Election early December before the school examination period commences, Deshapriya said.
He said the registration forms for the Electoral Register will be sent to Grama Niladhari officers by May. The distribution of these forms will commence by mid May and will conclude on July 30. By September we will be able to finish with the revisions on the electoral register, he said.
Asked if the Election Commission is able to hold the Provincial Council Election at short notice, Deshapriya said the commission will request for three months to prepare for the election.
The last time we prepared for a hasty election, we were thrown into a difficult position. So we will request for three months to prepare for the election, Deshapriya said.
Deshapriya also said the Election Commission together with PAFFREL will hold a workshop today at the Waters Edge for all political party representatives and other civil organisations on the necessity of holding the provincial council election.

So spake Sajith
All right thinking people in this country would agree with Minister Sajith Premadasa that spending rupees one billion to renovate parliament was a national crime. Declaring open a modern village in Ududumbara, the minister, according to our new report, said: I learnt recently that Rs.1 billion is to be spent for the renovation work of the parliament which seems to me a national crime. He went onto say that such a sum of money could be utilized to construct 2,000 houses, comprising 80 villages, with 25 housing units per village. Such an amount of money, at least, could be made use of to feed those suffering from malnutrition, provide drinking water to people, grant plots of land to those deprived of land, or, provide employment opportunities to the jobless, he said.
Sajith Premadasa is one government minister who maintains a prominent visibility, almost daily shown on television opening model villages, drinking water projects or bestowing other services to the poor. One could verily say that he is a chip of the old block, emulating his father in this respect and is admired by both friend and foe alike. He also has taken after his father in captivating his audiences with speeches of a lyrical quality. People listen to Sajith and take his words seriously, like they took to heart the words of his late father.
Therefore when he says that spending a colossal Rs. 1 billion to renovate parliament, it, no doubt, will resonate with the people and show the government in poor light.
Surely, parliament does not appear to seem that it will require such a large sum to effect renovations. It was only recently that some expensive state of the art equipment was installed in the house to facilitate electronic voting. Or is this in view of plans to change the election system to accommodate 250 MPs A sum of Rs 4 million of public funds are spent for each sitting day and the 225 MPs receive Rs. 2,500 each as attendance allowance. This is apart from the staggering sums gobbled up for the subsidized meals of the MPs. What is the need, one may ask, for adding to this already monstrous bill to maintain our peoples representatives, who, in any event, does not deserve the plush comforts they already enjoy
As Minister Premadasa contends, there are enough and more areas that this money could be invested to better the lot of the poor. Not just parliament, massive amounts are spent on other wasteful exercises, money that could be diverted for better use. There is a yet unoccupied Agricultural Ministry building for which several millions are spent each month, for nothing. This, while, there are complaints that the Salawa and Meethotamulla victims are yet to be paid their full compensation.
Be that as it may, this country cannot afford to continue spending what it does at present, to maintain its elected representatives, be it at Parliament, Provincial Council or Local Government level. It was only the other day that President Maithripala Sirisena expressed his displeasure, in no uncertain terms, at having to utilize a massive amount of money on behalf of the over 7,000 newly elected local councillors. Most will contend that the billions spent to maintain these leeches is a national crime indeed. For most MPs, parliament is a place where they can have a nice siesta, while proceedings are ongoing, as oftentimes seen during televised debates in the House.
When Sajith Premadasa says it is a national crime to spend Rs. 1 billion for the renovation work of parliament he, even unwittingly, may have hit the nail on the head. What is the need, one may ask, for spending such a large sum to spruce up a place which, more often than not is empty, and at other times turned into a blood sport arena The general public, for sure, would look aghast at the thought that such a large sum of money is spent to further the comforts of our honourable peoples representatives whose conduct and language used in the well of the House had even caused schoolchildren in the Public Gallery to run for cover.
The government ought to get its priorities right. Now that a minister, himself, has put his finger on the point, it should desist from going ahead with this project. Not just parliament. It should bring to a halt all wasteful expenditure and utilize such funds for worthy projects in the larger interest of the general public. The recent setback suffered by the government at the local government election had also much to do with wasteful expenditure, such as the colossal amounts spent to provide duty free luxury vehicles to government ministers, through supplementary estimates passed in parliament.
Waste should also be eliminated in all government institutions. The World Bank Country Director for Sri Lanka and the Maldives Dr. Idah Pswarayi-Riddihough says that a staggering Rs.460 billion loss was suffered by around 400 state owned enterprises in 2016 and expressed concern that the government is contributing more to its public sector enterprises that receiving from it.
An observation that should engage the serious attention of the government.

Song-like stories Professor
I am quite thankful to the dear little creative writer, Aminthika Dissanayake who presented me her debut effort in the compilation of eight little narratives, titled as Little Dreams. Aminthika has told me that she is a student at Bishops College, Colombo 3. Having read these eight narratives as a reader, I felt that she possesses two major factors needed for a sensitive creative writer.
First, it is the creative imagination that seems to pervade other creative factors. Followed by this, she embraces the apt expression talents like communicative and linguistic skills. One good example is the first narrative titled as Song. Here she tries to humbly disagree with her music teacher without commenting it openly in the following introspective expression:
My Music Teacher says that to make a song, you should decide on the perfect tune. That tune should have a rhythmical beat. Once the tune is set, you must compose meaningful lyrics that fit into the tune. The lyrics should come under a certain theme and should go with the title.
This verdict is sensitively challenged by the narrator, the pupil, in these words.
But to me, a song is never created in that way. A song is the call of your heart.
Carrying on, the reader perhaps enters a realm of poetic vision that embraces a series of imagery.
A song is a flowing sweet melody that takes you on a journey through your heart. Music is the greatest part of my life.
Even the little wooden flute that was handed to me by my great-grandfather was part of my life.
The poetic vision deepens as the narrator presents a convincible lively experience creating contemplative isolation. Each sentence is a thought-stream that goes as: My heart filled with the urge to burst into song and I hummed slowly before beginning
My words blew into the air with meanings that only the birds understood
I sang of the beautiful serene view from the mountain tops and the peaceful green valleys down below.
I sang the bubbling creeks as they gush down over the smooth pebbles and the trees that sway gently in the morning breeze and the golden rays of the sun pour down on the new leaves.
This stream of thoughts transferred into a series of words, the reader discerns as the birth of a song. The scene changes with the opening of the gate in the garden. An overhearing neighbour lady enters, saying: I heard your singing, simply beautiful. I was so overwhelmed.
The narrative culminates in the actual presentation of the song born in that manner. The songster is ushered into a competition where her theory is put into action. Once again the poetic vision emerges as she notes:
I started my song, and I myself was stunned as the tunes pulsed high and low, swooping over the words.
The reader feels that the words are born from the innermost layer of the heart. The narrator now is blended as the songster notes that her song which is endless comes to a close with a tear trickle down her cheek. What happens next The audience cheers so loud that the judges ring a bell to quieten them. The songster thus born is adjudged by the panel as the young songstress of the year. She clambers down the stage with the enormous trophy in her hands. The short poetic narrative comes to a close with the words:
I had achieved the greatest of my dreams and I knew it. I feel that this kind of short narrative written in the form of a poetic pattern is packed with delight as well as the wisdom that one needs the attention of our own creators, teachers and the media message builders of all types.
I sincerely agree with the views held by the principal of Bishops College where the creator studies as a ten-year-old student. She says:
Her stories show a sensitivity and awareness of a child brought up in surroundings which encourage observation and creativity.
The creativity as shown in Little Dreams is not confined to a particular parochial culture and/or social setting. It transcends the geographical barriers by way of trying to enter into some of the historical past episodes.
Two good examples are The Way I See It and Confused, Angered, Lost. In some ways, the narrative pattern of Aminthika comes closer to fantasies transcends the contents of fairy tales. Perhaps as a reader, I may not know the exact aesthetic sense which she tries to achieve. But I feel that I can visualise myself within the frame of the creative territory. This then is the bliss of the creative process that differs from one creator to another.
To use a high flown term the narrative situation in the story titled as Confused, Angered, Lost centre around a theme of reconciliation. But in actual realistic terms, it is a simple situation where two girls meet each other, forgetting the fact that they belong to two identically different social conditions. Perhaps an imaginative reader could feel several other layers of meanings in it. There are quite a number of innovative nuances the reader may come across.
One good example is titled as The Forest. In this imaginative narrative, a slave camp is pictured, where two runaway slave girls are portrayed. Perhaps the alien nature of the slave master link may not be the issue the creator intends to present.
Instead, it is a study of the mindset of two girls namely Africa and Sylvia. The story setting may look alien but the human interest is closer to the heart. The Little Dreams to my understanding ought to be a compilation that deserves to enter into a healthy literary discourse rather absent nowadays in the academic atmosphere. I invite the attention of the elders the parents as well as the teacher to take more attention to this kind of innovative creative writing. This could be a wonderful starting point. A tribute to literary-minded parents and teachers.

Sri Lankan among victims in Toronto terror attack
A Sri Lankan woman is among the ten victims killed in Monday's deadly van attack in Toronto.
Renuka Amarasinghe, 48 years old from Horana, had been living in Toronto for over a decade as a single mother to her seven-year-old son when a white van plowed into pedestrians on Torontos Yonge Street, a main commercial thoroughfare. Among Amarasinghe and nine others who were killed, 14 people remain in the hospital with injuries, some critical.
Amarasinghe had been regularly involved with the Toronto Mahavihara Buddhist Centre for the past 15 years, said itsChief Priest Ven. Ahangama Rathanasiri Thero. The Thero said the bodies of the deceased have yet to be released, as not all have been identified yet, but that Amarasinghe's final rites will be held in Canada where she is a citizen and where her son still resides. He added that the temple will do all it can for Amarasinghes child and his future.
The suspect in the attack, Alek Minassian, was charged on Tuesday with ten counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder. Minassian joined Canadas armed forces last year but was released after just sixteen days on his own request. According to those who know him, Minassian was a socially awkward student; but online, he had a propensity to rage in social media posts about women who rejected his romantic advances.
