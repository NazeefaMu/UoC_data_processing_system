Government cannot be toppled by disrupting essential services: Sampanthan


The government cannot be toppled by disrupting the essential services, Opposition Leader and Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader R. Sampanthan said in Parliament today.
He also said that disrupting the essential services is an act against democracy.
He added that the Joint Opposition is attempting to topple the government by interrupting the essential services.
But everybody should realize the government has received the peoples mandate, Opposition leader said. 
The provision of fuel to the people is essential. But the Joint Opposition is attempting to disrupt it. That is the reason why the President declared the distribution of fuel is an essential service.
He also added that the trade unions are essential for a democratic country but they should not cripple the essential services of a country.
During such situations, the government should take strong decisions to solve the problems of the people, he said

Growth potential for countrys retail sector high
Growth potential for the countrys retail sector continues to be high and Sri Lankas retail sector ranking according to the A.T Kearney Global Retail Development Index leap frogged to 12 in 2017, from 20 in 2011, Softlogic Holdings told its shareholders in its annual report for the financial year 2016/2017.
A.T Kearney also projects the countrys retail sales per capita to grow by 6% over the next two years, driven by economic growth, increasing disposable incomes as well as the surge in tourist arrivals into the country.
The insufficient availability of retail space in Colombo continues to be a constraint for the industry and may affect its ability to cater to growing demands from the domestic and tourist markets.
Currently, the mall stock in Colombo is limited to eight, with five new projects in the pipeline.
The growth potential presented by the retail industry remains attractive and the group is assured that the setback faced last year is a temporary one.
Its unified retail sector strategy focusing on premium brands and geographical expansion has placed the company in a strong position to capture long-term growth opportunities of this sector.
Softlogic signed with the Canadian fashion brand, ALDO, during the year and will continue to expand its brand offerings as it also acquired the distributorship rights for leading fashion and accessories brand such as the Toy Store, Armani Exchange, Trussardi, Cavalli Class, Blumarine, Hallmark and Love Moschino.
The company looks forward to exciting opportunities presented by the Odel Mall, a highly eco-friendly and sustainable project designed by a leading German architect firm.
This stylish, sophisticated and cosmopolitan mixed development project looks at a space of 640,000 sqft that will comprise of a first-of-its kind retail shopping experience which will be the address for the worlds topnotch brands in Sri Lanka.
Apart from housing Sri Lankas most exclusive mall, the project will also include spa and sports facilities, culinary diversity covering an array of fine dining and multi-cuisine restaurants providing a gastronomic experience, a multiplex cinema  one of the largest of its kind in the country, with seven fully equipped, top-notch cinema halls inviting visitors to an immersive cinematic experience, superlative amenities, open public spaces and 39 exclusive limited edition luxury apartments topped off with a sky garden and parking for 550 vehicles.

HSBC Future Lions programme invites golf loving kids
HSBC together with the Sri Lanka Golf Union will conduct the HSBC Future Lions grass root Golf programme from 1-5 August 2017. The programme is organized on the sidelines of the first ever HSBC International Junior Golf Championship between Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.
The HSBC Future Lions grass root programme is open to kids between 813 years of age across Sri Lanka, who are keen to learn the game of golf.
Registrations are currently open and interested parents and schools can call Duminda on 0714-327343 at the Sri Lanka Golf Union to register for any location convenient for them.
The HSBC Future Lions grass root programme will be conducted in four locations, namely ColomboAqua Golf driving range in Welisara, Anuradhapura  Eagles Heritage Golf Club, Victoria Golf & Country Club Digana, Kandy and Nuwara Eliya Golf Club. This programme will then culminate with the Junior Golf championship (Individual event) on 9 August and the much looked forward to HSBC International Junior Golf championship featuring national teams from four countries on 10 August.
Tharanga Gunasekera, Head of Marketing and Communications  HSBC stated, As a global supporter of golf, we are extremely happy to have partnered with the Sri Lanka Golf Union to introduce a structured event in our endeavor to promote the game to kids in Sri Lanka. We welcome our clients and all Sri Lankans who are interested in getting their children enrolled, to sign them up at any of the four locations across Sri Lanka.
Anil Perera, a Class A Professional from the PGTCA of America who will be in charge of the grass root roll out said, Our aim is to try and condition kids who have never played golf before to try and understand it through visuals that demonstrate the Key Concepts that is grip, stance, posture and swing. There will also be a golf video shown and we are going to play a hole with instructors who are scratch golfers. All participating students will be positioned along the fairways while pros play the hole from the tee box to the green and show how to finish a game. This is what done in North America where children are taken through the process of conditioned by viewing tour professionals playing at PGA tournaments.
There will be hitting stations set up where one group will be engaged in the full swing and the others will putt at the putting green with two instructors each at each station, enabling each child to hit about 10 golf balls. Given that some of these kids have never held a golf club before, they will be monitored and guided throughout the process.
Firaz Hameed, captain of the Nuwara Eliya Golf Club said, We began our junior academy in 2014 with just six kids that has grown successfully with 220 children being enrolled to date. So by opening up the game to the local community in Nuwara Eliya, we are confident that the program will reach the next level.
Chairperson of the Junior Sub Committee, Sri Lanka Golf Union, Niloo Jayatilake added, It is indeed heartwarming to have had the unstinting support from all those who responded so spontaneously to promote at grass root level, a game in which Sri Lanka has the potential to one day perform on the global arena.
There now is a structure in place to unearth new talent and to truly develop and broad base the sport. The talent search in particular will no doubt take more than a few years to reap its full potential, but I am confident that judging by the overwhelming response received this year, the SLGU will have no difficulty in continuing with this format in the years to come.

Be Truly  Green!
Green architecture, or green design, is an approach to building that minimizes harmful effects on human health and the environment. The "green" architect or designer attempts to safeguard air, water, and earth by choosing eco-friendly building materials and construction practices. "GREEN" BUILDING:
You don't need a green roof to be a green building, although Italian architect Renzo Piano not only created a green roof, but also specified recycled blue jeans as insulation in his design of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.
You don't need a vertical garden or green wall to have a green building, yet French architect Jean Nouvel has successfully experimented with the concept in his design for One Central Park residential building in Sydney, Australia.
Construction processes are also part of green building design. How did Great Britain transform a brown field into the site of the London 2012 summer Olympic Games Dredging waterways, sourcing building materials, recycling concrete, and using rail and water to deliver materials are just some of their 12 Green Ideasimplemented by the host country and overseen by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the ultimate authority for requiring Olympic-sized sustainable development.
The highest goal of green architecture is to be fully sustainable. Simply put, you do "green" things in order to achieve sustainability. While most green buildings do not have all of the following features, green architecture and design may include: *Ventilation systems designed for efficient heating and cooling *Energy-efficient lighting and appliances *Water-saving plumbing fixtures *Landscapes planned to maximize passive solar energy *Minimal harm to the natural habitat *Alternate power sources such as solar power or wind power *Non-synthetic, non-toxic materials used inside and out *Locally-obtained woods and stone, eliminating long-haul transportation *Responsibly-harvested woods *Adaptive reuse of older buildings *Use of recycled architectural salvage *Efficient use of space *Optimal location on the land, maximizing sunlight, winds, and natural sheltering WHOLE BUILDING DESIGN:
Green design has many related names and concepts associated with it, besides sustainable development. Some people emphasize the ecology and have adopted names like eco-design, eco-friendly architecture, and even arcology. Others take their cue from the environmental movement, arguably begun by Rachel Carson's 1962 book Silent Springearth-friendly architecture, environmental architecture, natural architecture, and even organic architecturehave aspects of green architecture.
A building can look beautiful and even be constructed from very expensive materials, but not be "green." Likewise, a building can be very "green" but visually unappealing. How do we get good architecture How do we move toward what Roman architect Vitruvius suggested to be thethree rules of architectureto be well-built, useful by serving a purpose, and beautiful to look at
The National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) argues that sustainability has to be part of the whole design process, from the very start of the project. They devote an entire website to WBDGWhole Building Design Guide at www.wbdg.org/. Design objectives are interrelated, where designing for sustainability is just one aspect. "A truly successful project is one where project goals are identified early on," they write, "and where the interdependencies of all building systems are coordinated concurrently from the planning and programming phase." Green architectural design should not be an add-on. - thoughtco.com

Belt and Road Initiative will attract more FDI into Sri Lanka: Experts

Sri Lanka's participation in China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative will boost the country's economy and help it attract more foreign direct investment (FDI), participants of the "Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017" have said.
Speaking at a gathering on Wednesday, Jim McCabe, Chief Executive Officer of Standard Chartered Bank, Sri Lanka said the Belt and Road Initiative would strengthen the country's competitiveness and improve its growth and development.
Proposed by China in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, aiming at building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient trade routes of Silk Road.
"TheBelt and Road Initiativewill help Sri Lanka get the FDIs it needs. The OBOR has many positives for the island country," McCabe said.
Wen Zha, associate professor from China Foreign Affairs University speaking at the summit, said the Belt and Road Initiative will cover more than 4 billion people and it would increase connectivity in the region.
She said the initiative was open to all the countries and Sri Lanka would be an important part of the initiative due to its geographical location in the Indian Ocean region.
"Sri Lanka can link its own development plan to China's initiative in order to achieve a win-win situation," Wen said.
However, participants also said at the summit that Sri Lanka must do more to be better involved in the initiative in order to reap benefits.
"Language is a barrier between the two and Sri Lanka must take steps to learn the Chinese language," Group Managing Director of Sunshine Holdings PLC Vish Govindasamy said.
The two-day annual summit, which ended on Wednesday, organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, attracted over 40 sectoral experts, industry practitioners, government officials and Ministers taking part to discuss ways of strengthening the island's economy.

## Title: Blind Men and the Glyphosate Elephant

Blind Men and the Glyphosate Elephant
Reading the article Glyphosate Weed killer now destroys health in the plantations! in the media by Kalani Kumarasinghe reminds us of the proverbial elephant and the blind men, each superficially touches the subject of glyphosate and makes various assumptions and prognostications.
The sentimental assertions of representatives of three NGOs, Peoples Planning National forum, Movement of Land and Agriculture Reforms and the Peoples Movement of Plantation Lands Right with little or no factual substance on the matter of the ban are ridiculous.
There were also the comments of a few others including a professor holding extremist views on the matter. He once wrote an article referring to glyphosate as a cobra! This cobra is living funnily freely in every country other than our motherland of foolish politicians and the like. It may of course be poisonous if mishandled!
All substances are poisons said the founder of the science of pharmacology over 600 years ago. What matters is the quantity and how it is used. It applies not only to agrochemicals but pharmaceuticals too. If you swallow 50 pills of aspirin you may drop dead. Statins, for example, the cholesterol lowering drug now taken by nearly a quarter of the elderly population of the world, and once thought to be absolutely safe, is now known to cause diabetes!
The columnist of this article says that glyphosate was banned owing to findings linking the chemical with the kidney disease. It must, at the very outset, be stressed that hitherto there has been no acceptable scientific evidence that glyphosate is the cause of the kidney disease or more accurately, the chronic kidney disease of uncertain aetiology (CKDu).
Research
She should do well to know that hitherto, despite substantial research, there is no aetiological agent identified. It is often the case, that many media personnel, just surface scratch issues and pick up only the sensation, leaving behind the true facts of the matter! Their only objective is to draw public attention rather than public education. A popular TV channel, had, for example, an entire programme for several months where CKDu was referred to as the Agricultural Kidney Disease!
There are various alleged etiolating agents such as heavy metals(arsenic, cadmium), hard water, fluoride and ionicity ( dissolved salts) just to name a few. What is hitherto known, however, with a degree of certainty in that people who drank water from dug wells in the affected areas of the North Central Province and some neighbouring areas contacted the disease but not the people who drank river, reservoir, or spring water.
This fact has been elegantly established by a study of two adjoining villages, Sarabumi and Badulupura in Girandurukotte. People in the highlands of Badulapura drink water from dug wells, whereas those in Sarabumi from the river or reservoirs. Villagers from both areas had common paddy tracts in the lowlands, and consumed their own paddy.
WHO studies
In fact it is reported that one person in the Sarabumi area who diagnosed with the disease had previously lived for a long period in Badulupura before coming over to Sarabumi. The disease was not there before people were settled in the Mahaweli Scheme.
The increasing population and settlements thereafter necessitated digging of wells for drinking water in homesteads. There are supposedly some 172, 000 such wells in the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Districts alone , and the governments urgent task should be to give potable water to the people of all affected areas. Is it happening
The hypothesis, that hard water, metal ions and glyphosate was probably the cause of CKDu was propounded by a few scientists in the Rajarata University. In fact on top of that publication which appeared in a fee-levying, open access journal in 2014, the word Hypothesis was written in bold letters! Several reputed chemists have been very critical of the hypothesis and no other scientific journal had any publication supportive of it. It has been argued that if such metal complexes form in hard water, they should precipitate making the metals unavailable in solution.
There were two comprehensive WHO studies on CKDu in Sri Lanka, one was in 2013 and the other 2016, the latter being an International Expert Consultation of 54 participants, including local experts. None of those studies implicated glyphosate in CKDu. In fact the first study amongst other things reported that 3.5% of the CKDu patients had glyphosate above reference limits. However, for some unknown reason the percent of control patients with urine glyphosate values exceeding the reference level was not reported.
On re-analysis of the raw data again in 2016, it was revealed that double (7.0%) the non-CKDu subjects had urine glyphosate levels exceeding reference limits! In fact the percentage of non-CKDu subjects with pesticide residue levels above reference limits was significantly higher than that of the CKDu subjects.
The association of the disease with farming communities naturally tempts one to think of an involvement of agrochemicals in the disease. But the fact is that the great majority of people living in these areas are farmers, and the clue that it is probably associated with drinking water is what must be pursued in the pursuit for identification of the aetiology.
The glyphosate levels reported by a study of the Registrar of Pesticides in 2016 are very low, being less than 1 part per billion in samples of soil, water and vegetables analysed. The maximum allowable limit in drinking water in the European Union is as much as 700 parts per billion! So there is no question of glyphosate pollution of our food, water or soil.
Weeding
Ganeshalingam of the Peoples Movement for Plantation Land Rights speaking at this press meeting has even claimed that he has information of victims of CKDu in all estates. This is the first time we are hearing of the disease in the hill country! Has he brought this to the attention of the health authorities in the country So far, the evidence is that the disease is confined only to the Dry Zone.
It is unimaginable that all these representatives of organisations that have made various utterances, have not been mindful of the key issue of the tea plantations, and that is the grave scarcity of labour.
It is impossible to use labour for weeding because of the shortage. Moreover, although a learned professor speaks of alternative weeding technologies, can he demonstrate them in tea lands The only alternative other than chemical weeding is physical weeding with implements such as the mammoty and the sorandiya which, prior to the 1960s, caused serious soil erosion which led even to abandonment of vast tracts tea of land especially from the mid-country. It has been estimated that losses due to crop-weed competition and weed interference in field operations such as plucking and manuring has cost over Rs six billion in 2015 alone.
It is true that rice can be cultivated without glyphosate, but weed control prior to land preparation needs substantial water use for impounding. It is estimated that some 20% of the water has to be used for weed control in rice, and water has a cost.
There is clear evidence that the acreage under field crops has declined after the ban of glyphosate. In particular ploughing and harrowing cannot control the noxious weed Cyperus which must be killed with a contact herbicide, and glyphosate is ideal for this purpose.
Farmers
The corn farmers complain that their pre-plant weed control has shot up from Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 10,000 after the glyphosate ban, especially because of the need to uproot mana grass by mamoty. Eight labour units are required each costing Rs. 1,250. Many of the dry zone farmers have been hoodwinked by the anti-glyphosate lobby that it causes CKDu. When explained to them that there is no evidence to associate glyphosate with the disease, they were aghast!
It is unfortunate that we live in a country that scientific decisions are made by politicians. We need an organisation of professionals that make evidence-based decisions. India has an excellent one, the National Technology Commission which would have been the organisation making the decision on a matter such as the glyphosate issue were it necessary.

Building an architect!
The Architecture program of the University of Moratuwa is based on the conviction that nurturing of future architects must coincide with local building needs and aspirations, thus promoting necessary cultural dialogues and reflections, and facilitating professional development in critical directions. ArchWorld speaks to Head Department of Architecture Archt. Dr. U.G.D. Weerasinghe on the need to create professionals who could shoulder the national needs with sensitivity to local environment, professional context and social necessities while being exposed to the changing international discourses, developments and concerns.
Architecture Faculty is one of the five faculties at Moratuwa University. There are four departments in the Faculty of Architecture: the Departments of Architecture, Building Economics, Town and Country Planning and Integrated Design.
Recent Courses
In the Architecture department we are conducting a five year Bachelor of Architecture honors degree (B.Arch.) course. The Architecture program had started around 50 years ago. Recently we started a Bachelor in Landscape Architecture Course which is of four years duration. The Department conducts Masters programs in Urban Design, Interior Design and Architectural Conservation of Monuments and Sites. For B.Arch. the annual intake is 60 and for Landscape Architecture it is 50. In the Bachelor of Architecture program we are increasing the intake gradually. In about three years time it will reach 80, said Weerasinghe.
To enter these undergraduate courses the students have to pass the Advanced Level examination and then pass an aptitude test conducted by the University. About 3000  3500 students sit the aptitude test. The final selection is made by the UGC where the other criteria also comes in. The demand for Architecture course is very high.
The Departments academic vision, as documented by the Department, is based on five major positions of architectural inquiry: social craft, environmental response, material practice, human element and intellectual pursuit. The five major positions, as documented and summarized are as follows:
Architecture as a social craft
Firstly, we instill in our students the need to assess architecture as a social craft, thus framing the function of architecture as a social and inclusive art, and acknowledging the architects inexorable role as a responsible practitioner, thinker and member of the society at large.
Secondly, we expand our students sense of responsibility towards recognizing architecture as an environmental response, through a strong research and theoretical content that examines how buildings perform in relation to specific climatic, topographic and typological conditions.
Thirdly, we emphasize on the role of architecture as a material practice, imparting our students with the necessary skills and competency in determining tectonic systems, solutions and advancements, and capacity to understand how design ideas are attuned to meet building performance challenges.
Fourthly, we are committed to produce graduates who understand architecture as a process that acknowledges  and involves - the human element. Being respectful towards social needs, understanding peculiarities of the building users, and acknowledging building as a social process that involves a team of building actors and decision makers in its making, etc.
Intellectual pursuit
Finally, we encourage students to view architecture as an intellectual pursuit, which not only concerns design narration, philosophy and aesthetics, but also include their ability to systematize, determine and communicate the technicalities of negotiating the art and science of an architectural approach, explained Weerasinghe
Based on the five positions mentioned above, each semester is organized under a specific theme of investigation formulated for the academic semesters of the: Environment, Craft, Space, Technology, Context, Building Process, Society, Place, and Profession.
In the architecture program the main component is design.
Understanding the needs of the client is an essential factor the students are trained to respond to. But that is only one facet. They acquire skills to respond to the context of a design project; the physical, social, economic and environmental context, keeping in mind the economic factors, and income level of the client while ensuring sustainability and technological competence of the design solutions as well. In a nutshell those are the things we teach them to be sensitive to. Further, most of the design projects attempt to resolve real life issues, where the students go out to the field and meet clients, relevant organizations and collect data. They respond to real life issues. said Archt. Dr. U.G.D. Weerasinghe
Then there is a wide range of theory subjects which are supportive and contribute to design, for example, on theory and history of architecture, structural principles, use of materials, response to climate, management and profession, to name a few. All these inputs contribute towards the design projects of the students.
Guide
According to the Departments academic position, the Level 1 curriculum introduces students to spatial, cultural and compositional ideas, strategies and skills, which form the basis of creating an architectural vision and an architectural response, to interrogate and communicate notions that explore architecture as an environmental response, a social craft and a spatial art.
The specific inquiries in the Level 2 focus on the notions of 'space' and 'technology', triggering student's imagination, curiosity and individuality, while introducing them to the pragmatics of building design and production.
In Level 3, the theoretical spotlight falls onto the inevitable relationship architectural design weaves with its physical context in general, and with the spaces, forms and people of an urban realm in particular. At the conclusion of this phase - in the Level 3 of the academic program - all students take a Major Design Project (MDP) to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquired during the first 3 years of their architectural education. During the second semester of Level 3, students are formally apprenticed in professional practice under a Chartered Architect through a monitored training program.
The Level 4 academic program encourages students to critically evaluate - and respond to - both tangible and intangible objectives, concerns and situations, which determine the role of architectural profession in responding to specific societal and place-centric attributes of building production.
In Level 5, to demonstrate the knowledge they have thus far acquired on architectural design and practice, the students complete a Comprehensive Design Project (CDP) and a Dissertation on a preferred area of study. For the Comprehensive Design Project (CDP), each student selects an actual project. It is a very comprehensive exercise. Meeting with clients and data collections from relevant organizations are carried out by the students. There are of course a diverse range of projects undertaken by students, elucidated Weerasinghe.
B.Arch. course is recognized by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), and the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects.
We got RIBA recognition more than 30 years ago. Every five years it is re-validated. Every year, the final design project (CDP) is evaluated by a local panel and moderated by an international panel. The final moderation panel is composed of an experienced academic of high repute from the UK who represents RIBA, another examiner from the Asian region and a similarly experienced and reputed Chartered Architect from Sri Lanka. They evaluate the final design project, informed Weerasinghe.
The students are very much encouraged to work in design studios to develop their designs.
Design tutoring is one-to-one, where the lecturer instructs and guides each student individually. Being in contact with each student and guiding them in their design projects is a unique and rewarding experience. There is a lot of diversity in way students respond to design issues.
Though strenuous, it is never monotonous and is refreshing. My final message to any student would be, as professionals and beneficiaries of free education, to become useful citizens, and to serve society with honesty and integrity, shared Weerasinghe.

Is a China -Centric World Order inevitable 
Excerpts from the inaugural lecture held at the India International Centre.
We are currently in a prolonged stand-off with Chinese forces on the Doklam plateau and it is hoped that this will be eventually resolved peacefully. But in dealing with such situations it is helpful to be aware of the overall context in which specific events may be unfolding. Let me begin by sharing with you my own interpretation of Chinas display of unusually aggressive and threatening behaviour. My sense is that China was caught on the wrong foot by the unanticipated action taken by Indian armed forces to confront Chinas road building team in Doklam, which is Bhutanese territory. It has been engaged in its usual incremental nibbling advance in this area for several years, making dirt tracks, sending graziers in summers and occasional patrols.
The Bhutanese have lodged protests, there have been solemn commitments not to disturb the status quo but intrusions have continued. This time around the Chinese made bold to signal their intention to establish a permanent presence and may have believed that the Bhutanese would protest but would acquiesce. India, it was assumed, would be unhappy but would be unlikely to face-off China on Bhutanese territory.
A similar strategy has paid handsome dividends in the South China Sea where, since 2010, the facts on the ground have been repeatedly changed without encountering any serious opposition including from the U.S. This assumption was belied by the reaction from Bhutan and India. What may have been deemed to be a low cost, low risk activity, for which there were sufficient precedents, has now been transformed into a potentially high risk one. Hence the high decibel and threatening posture, designed to compel a stand-down by Indian forces, which would, in the end validate the original assumption.
This is a mind game, a Chinese brand of psychological war fare but one cannot rule out the possibility of frustration driving punitive action. Prudence demands that India should be prepared to deal with more serious contingencies including a possible prolonged impasse, such as prevailed in Wangdung in the eastern sector from1986 to 1992.
To recapitulate, it is in the summer of 1986 that the Chinese crossed the Thagla ridge, occupied a feature called Le, built permanent barracks as well as a helipad. This violated the status quo that the two sides had maintained for over a decade on the border but when India protested, the answer predictably was, as is the case in the present instance, that China was on its own territory, that it was merely strengthening border management on its side and that India should not overreact. However, in an unexpected move a few weeks later, Indian troops had moved to occupy a ridge parallel to Thagla, overlooking the Sumdorong River. Two forward posts were set up across the river below the ridge only 10 metres from a Chinese forward post. This unexpected Indian response invited a harsh and vituperative reaction from the Chinese side, which insisted that it was only a withdrawal of the Indian troops from the heights they had occupied which would defuse the situation.
The stand-off continued for nearly a decade before there was an agreed mutual withdrawal. Will this precedent prevail or will there be a different denouement This is a difficult question to answer but it may be useful to locate any specific event such as Doklam in a broader perspective which takes into account the domestic political dynamic inside China, the perceptions of Chinese leadership regarding the evolving regional and international political, economic and security landscape and the relative positions in this landscape of both China and India.
Chinese strategic thinking
On August 29, 2012, I had the honour to deliver at this very venue, the Second Annual K. Subrahmanyam Lecture entitled, China in the Twenty-First Century: What India Needs to Know About Chinas World View. In that lecture I had argued that managing the China challenge requires a much deeper understanding of the nature of Chinese civilisation, its cultural particularities and the world view of its people, formed layer upon layer, over five thousand years of unbroken though sometimes tumultuous history. However, I had also cautioned against applying historical patterns mechanistically to the present. I had pointed out that China is undergoing a dramatic transformation and its traditional culture and ways of thinking can no longer be sourced only to persistent templates of the past. So we need to be aware that these templates are being overlaid with concepts and ideas borrowed from other traditions and thought systems and these lead to behaviour patterns arising out of the deep transformation within China itself and the world around us.
The ideas of Mackinder and Mahan are as much discernible in Chinese strategic thinking today as are the concepts derived from the writings of the ancient Chinese strategist Sun Zi. The One Belt One Road project is Mackinder and Mahan in equal measure; the Belt designed to secure Eurasia which Mackinder called the World Island, dominance over which would grant global hegemony; and the Road which straddles the oceans, which would enable maritime ascendancy - the indispensable element in pursuing hegemony according to Mahan. There is an unmistakable American flavour in China seeking singular predominance at the top of a regional and global order, where the hierarchical principle is the guarantee of order. But it also echoes the Chinese sage Confucius, who argued that harmony and hierarchy were intertwined.
As long as each person knew his place in the pecking order and practises the conduct appropriate to it, all would be well. Americans never had any patience with protestations of multi-polarity. As Chinese power has accumulated, it, too, has jettisoned its earlier preference for multi-polarity. Now it is a new type of great power relations which is in vogue, with its requirement of China being accepted as having equal status as the established superpower, the United States. But this is only a pit-stop as China races ahead inexorably to the unipolar finish line.
China uses templates of the past to construct a modern narrative of power. These templates are the instruments of legitimisation. As students of international relations are aware, power is more effective if it carries a veneer of legitimacy, but as Kissinger has observed, the balance between legitimacy and power is extremely complex. Legitimacy enables the economical use of power because it fosters a sentiment of acquiescence among those who are the object of such exercise of power, not requiring the actual use of violence or coercion. Deconstructing the Chinese narrative of power may help us decode its international behaviour and manage the challenge posed by its rapid and, by all metrics, spectacular rise. One key element of the narrative is that Chinas role as the dominant power in Asia, to which other countries must defer, is a return to a position it had occupied for most of history. The period of about 150 years stretching from the middle of the 18th century to the year of Chinas liberation in 1949, is characterised as an aberration when it was reduced to a semi-colonial status and subjected to invasions by imperialist powers and Japan.
Chinese history
The tributary system is being presented as artful statecraft evolved by China to manage inter-state relationships in an asymmetrical world. What is rarely acknowledged is that China itself was a frequent tributary itself to keep marauding tribes on its frontiers, at bay. The Tang emperor paid tribute to the Tibetans as well as to the fierce Xiongnu tribes on the western frontiers to be allowed to remain in peace. In most cases, the exaction of tribute was a means to regulate trade with countries in the region, who were politically autonomous and mostly independent. It is true that Chinese culture did spread to several countries on Chinas periphery but this did not always imply political control. This is most apparent in the case of Japan, which successive Chinese empires failed to subdue.
It is true that there were periods in Chinese history when its periphery was occupied by relatively weaker states. But China itself occupied and ruled by non-Han invaders, including the Mongols from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries and the Manchus from the fifteenth to the twentieth century. Far from considering these alien empires as oppressive, the modern Chinese political dispensation, seeks to project itself as a successor state, entitled to the territorial acquisitions of those empires, including vast non-Han areas such as Xinjiang and Tibet. As has been pointed out by Mark Elliot, there is a bright line drawn from empire to republic.
Thus, it is an imagined history that is being put forward to seek legitimacy for Chinas claim to Asian hegemony. What is remarkable is how much of this contrived history is being considered as self-evident in western and even Indian discourse.
There is little in history to support the proposition that China was indeed the centre of the Asian universe commanding deference among less civilised states around its periphery. It is on the basis of its economic and military capabilities, its accumulation of knowledge capital and mastery of science and technology and, above all, to its contribution to the global commons that it must claim its rightful place in the emerging world order. Its contemporary rise is indeed remarkable but does not entitle it to claim a fictitious centrality bestowed upon it by history.
The One Belt One Road also seeks to promote the notion that through most of its history, China was the hub from which trade and transportation routes radiated across Central Asia to Europe and across the seas to Asia, maritime Europe and even the eastern coast of Africa. China was one of the countries which participated in a veritable network of caravan and shipping routes which criss-crossed the ancient landscape before the advent of European imperialism. Chinese silk was certainly prized across the world as were its ceramics. But so was Indian cotton, spices and precious gems. China was never a major trading nation and remained relatively insular through most of its history.
It never developed the cosmopolitan spirit which has been a hallmark of the Indian temperament as it should be for a crossroads culture.
There were other great trading nations including the ancient Greeks and Persians and later the Arabs. Much of the Silk Road trade was actually in the hands of the Sogdians who inhabited the oasis towns leading from India in the east and Persia in the west into western China. Thus, the recasting of a much more complex history of trade and transportation to reflect a Chinese centrality that never existed is another part of the current Chinese narrative of power and the Belt and Road Forum convened by President Xi Jinping in Beijing in March this year was designed to demonstrate that Chinese centrality was being accepted by friend and adversary alike as a natural manifestation of national rejuvenation put forward by him.
Inter-connected global market
China is today a great trading nation and justifiably called the factory of the world. But it owes its current prosperity to being part and parcel of a densely inter-connected global market and extended global value chains. This has little to do with economic history which is that of a mostly self-contained and insular economy where external trade contributed little to its prosperity.
It is true that sections of Asian and Western opinion have already begun to concede to China, the role of a predominant power with the corollary that it is best for the rest to acquiesce to this inevitability. In a recent book, Destined For War: Can America and China Escape the Thucydides Trap by Graham Allison, Professor, Harvard University has used a historical analogy from the Peloponnesian War between ancient Sparta and Athens in the 5th century B.C. to describe how a rising power always challenges an established power and that war is often the result. This is called the Thucydides Trap named after the famous chronicler of the war.
The Chinese are delighted to be benchmarked with the U.S. with the corollary that the latter must make concessions and accommodate China in order to avoid the Thucydides Trap. However, in all other metrics of power, with the exception of GDP, China is still far behind the U.S. whether in terms of military capabilities, scientific and technological advancement and innovative economy. In reality we are neither in a China-centric Asia let alone a China-centric world. China may continue to expand its economic and military capabilities and may even become the most powerful country in the world. But in the world which is emerging will be home to a cluster of major powers, both old and new, including in Asia. The Chinese economy is slowing down, as has been the case with every major economy in the past. It has an ageing population and an ecologically ravaged landscape and mounting debt which is now 250% of GDP. A simple linear projection of Chinese current growth into the future may not be realistic. China also remains a brittle and opaque polity and rising insecurity within its political leadership sits uneasily with overweening arrogance of power and hubris. Its historical insularity is at odds with the cosmopolitanism which our densely inter-connected contemporary world demands of any aspiring global power.
When Bismarck had successfully created a powerful German state at the heart of Europe, he was conscious of the anxieties among European states which would seek to constrain and countervail its expanding influence. He called this the cauchemar of coalitions or the nightmare of countervailing coalitions which any emerging and potentially threatening power will confront.
China, too, has these nightmares and this is why it seeks to use the Chanakyan instruments of Sama, Bhed, Dana and Dand to prevent coalitions from crystallising. An aura of overwhelming power and invincibility is cultivated to prevent resistance and forestall coalitions. Despite this coalitions are forming in the region and the accretion of Chinese military power is sought to be countered by a significant uptrend in military expenditures and security capabilities of all major Asia-Pacific countries.
It is important to understand this Chinese strategy and counter it through carefully crafted diplomacy. India will need both internal and external balancing. It has to be more single-minded in building up its own economic and security capabilities even as it seeks to construct and expand countervailing coalitions to constrain China.
Strategy implies making choices among competing priorities. There is little doubt in my mind that the most significant challenge to India comes from the rise of China. There is also no doubt in my mind that China will seek to narrow Indias strategic space by penetrating Indias own neighbourhood and this is what we see happening in each of our sub-continental neighbours.
Unless India is able to confront this penetration and restore its primacy in its own periphery, it would be unable to play the larger game of countervailing Chinese power. What we are confronting in Doklam should be seen in this perspective. The enhanced Chinese activity would have been directed towards weakening Indias close and privileged relationship with Bhutan, opening the door to Chinas entry into the country and seek a settlement of the Sino-Bhutan border which would advance Chinese security interests vis-a-vis India. Unless properly handled there will be more such incidents which we may have to face.
Human and economic resources
The limited human and economic resources which we have, therefore, must be re-directed to securing the neighbourhood. If we find that we are spread thin over regions of lesser consequence, then a re-ordering of priorities may be necessary. I have argued in the past that the very asymmetry which India enjoys in the sub-continent should enable it to emerge as the engine of growth for all its neighbours. It must make urgent structural changes to create an empowered vehicle for the expeditious implementation of projects it has committed itself to in neighbouring countries. This alone can restore our badly eroded credibility in the region.
We need to pick and choose what are really the key issues on which we need to confront China. There may be Chinese actions which may cause us annoyance but may not be vital to our interests. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is but the UN listing of a Pakistan-based terrorist group is not. Focusing on China also implies an effort to narrow the scope of confrontation on other fronts. An escalation in tensions with Pakistan and the ominous revival of violent militancy in the Kashmir Valley only serve to increase Chinese external leverage against India.
What should Indias narrative be on how we should shape the emerging world order It should be apparent from my remarks that India should actively resist any attempt by a power to establish its dominance over Asia and the world. This may require closer and more structured coalitions with other major powers who share Indias preference. In fact the current and emerging distribution of power among major states both in Asia and across the globe would support a multipolar architecture which reflects the diffusion and diversity of power relations in an interdependent and interconnected world.
The history of the world since the birth of the Westphalian state system in the 17th century holds important lessons for us. A stable world order needs a careful balance, as pointed out earlier, between power and legitimacy. Legitimacy is upheld when states, no matter how powerful, observe the various established norms of state behaviour and codes of conduct acting through institutions which have been put in place over the past four centuries, layer upon layer.
The Westphalian system is by its very nature multipolar in character and is anchored on the assumption that any attempt by a state or group of states to gain hegemony will always invite countervailing action by other states in the system and, in extreme circumstances, through war. Hegemonic interludes mostly ended in war but when all key actors observe the rules of inter-state relations and norms of state behaviour, a stable order can be maintained as was the case during the long peace between 1815 and 1914.
Global in dimension
There are even more compelling reasons why the contemporary world needs a multipolar order. Most compelling challenges which we face as humanity are mostly cross-cutting and global in dimension. They are not amenable to national or even regional solutions. These include global warming, health pandemics, cyber-crime, drug trafficking, international terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The most effective means to deal with them are collaborative responses among states. A hegemonic order can constrain other states; it will rarely be able to promote collaborative action which can only be effective when based on consent and consultation, not coercion.
India possesses the civilizational attributes which could contribute to the success of a new international order attuned to contemporary realities. Its culture is innately cosmopolitan; it embraces vast diversity and inherent plurality and yet has a sense of being part of a common humanity. These are assets which it should leverage in helping shape a new world order which is humanity-centric. The mindless eruptions of narrow nationalism, communalism and sectarianism detract from the credibility of Indias role. We should seek to advance Indias interests but not without a constant awareness of our responsibilities in a larger, interlinked and interdependent world.

Much ado about human rights organisations
We have many organisations. Engineers Associations, Medical Officers Associations, Accountants Associations and Lawyers Associations. We also have human rights organisations. Engineers organisations are normally concerned about the rights of engineers. Medical officers organisation mainly look after the rights of doctors.
In case of human rights organisations, they look after the human rights of all the people irrespective of their nationality, race, culture, religion, etc.
Many human rights organisations around the world dedicate their efforts protecting human rights and ending human rights abuses.

CMPort to ink Hambantota Port lease with government on Saturday
China will go ahead with the signing of the Hambantota Port lease agreement with the government on Saturday, said Hang Tian, Deputy General Manager, China Merchant Port Holdings Company Ltd (CMPort).
Speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017 at the Cinnamon Grand yesterday, he said that this is not a deal to just manage a port but it is to transform a region. China will invest heavily in this project and create Hambantota harbor as a major logistic hub in the world, he said.
He also said that it is necessary to have a vision and believe that with right investments and commitment, the Hambantota Port could be turned around.
Hang Tian recalled that they first entered Sri Lanka by tendering for the CICT terminal along with 19 other bidders. But due to the gable economic crisis the others pulled out and they remained in Sri Lanka as they saw a feature in Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile Lakshman Jayasekara, Project Director, Ministry of Megapolis and Western Province Development, said that the support they received from the local private sector towards the Megapolis development project is very poor.
Several mega projects underway in Sri Lanka are opening up significant opportunities for domestic and international businesses. These include the Western Region and the Hambantota Logistics and Industrial Zone but Sri Lankan businesses are not too keen to leverage on these, while some are concerned that they will be spectators and not be able to fully capitalize on its benefits.
Local companies only forward agents and are not keen to invest in projects like the light rail system and other mega projects. He however said that the John Keels Group has set an example and have got involved in mega infrastructure projects.
Meanwhile Nadija Tambiah, Head of Legal, Secretarial and CSR, John Keells Holdings PLC, said that they are keen to engage in more mega projects but need country stability, clarity and most importantly, consistency in regulations.
She said that one area that needs quick attention is the labor laws. We also appeal to authorities to seek ways and means to employ temporary workers.
She also said that although there are a number of graduates, they are not seen to be actively engaged in employment.

The Congressional Caucus on Sri Lanka under the leadership of its Co-Chairs Representative Robert Aderholt (R-AL) and Representative Dina Titus (D-NV) recently renewed its registration as a Congressional Member Organization of the 115th U.S. Congress.
The Caucus comprises House Representatives from both the Republican and Democratic parties. Former House Representative Chris Van Hollen was the democratic Co-Chair of the Caucus until his election to the Senate at the beginning of this year.
The Sri Lanka Caucus has been active for over a decade and is one of over 50 country caucuses in the U.S. Congress.
The Caucus serves as an informal group of congressional members dedicated to issues related to Sri Lanka and educating other members on the subject.
The Caucus is a manifestation of the close bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and the United States. It also reflects the interest of congressional members, supported in particular by the Sri Lankan-American community and other well wishers, in promoting Sri LankaUnited States relations, especially people to people contacts both within the United States and between Sri Lanka and the United States.

## Title: Construction industry's present challenges and future...
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Finance
## Date: Thursday, July 27, 2017 - 01:00
Construction industry's present challenges and future...
Today, the growth of Sri Lanka's construction industry has become a hot topic. The housing construction sector in particular has seen rapid growth due to the rise in housing demand as well as government incentives for new housing projects.
As office space continues to plummet, skyscrapers and high-rises have begun to mushroom. With the countrywide expansion of infrastructural development which includes the massive US$ 40 billion megapolis development plan, the construction industry is heading for a revolutionary change.
In the construction industry, it is imperative to satisfy several key factors such as incorporating high quality raw material, cutting edge technology, skilled labour and a proper regulatory body, to constantly maintain highest quality and standard.
Certain factions, engaged in importing and selling substandard cement, have ruined the faith placed by consumers. This has been further affected by the flaws found in standardization process of cement.
Cement, sand, metals and steel are key materials used in the construction sector. Even though the construction sector utilize several other materials, these four elements - cement, metals sand and steel that are used for producing concrete - solely ensure the strength and durability of a building.
Cement
Out of the above mentioned elements, cement is the only material produced inside a factory under special quality controlled means. Only a cement manufacturing company, who has a 100% local manufacturing facility with fully integrated plant, can maintain consistent quality and standard throughout the process of cement production.
This consistent quality cement will lay a strong footing to local construction industry. If standardization techniques can be further developed parallel to the growth of the local construction sector, consumers will be able to buy the finest quality cement. It is essential to spread awareness amongst those involved in the construction sector and the general public of the importance of using high quality cement instead of importing and distributing low-priced substandard cement.
Sand
Finding high quality pristine sand is one of the biggest challenges faced by the industry. This type of sand is not only rare but is also priced highly. One of the main reasons for the high price is the lack of resources as opposed to the escalating demands. Moreover, after considering the environmental impact, the government has imposed strict laws on sand mining. Due to this reason, certain individuals have focused on mining inland dunes. However, sand excavated from inland dunes contains higher percentage of cohesive sediment (mud) which exceeds the recommended limits, posing difficulty in controlling cracks and ruptures that may appear in structures made of such concrete.
Under such circumstances, it is imperative for both government and the private sector to intervene in the matter and prevent an imminent collapse in the construction industry. As an alternative, sand can be pumped from the deep sea and can be delivered after controlling salt levels. Currently the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation has taken the initiative in this regard and with the collaborative support from the private sector, it would be possible to meet the rising demands.
Gravel and sand
Extraction of gravel and sand poses great difficulty for construction sector. Even though geographical mapping take place to certain extent, the problem remains unaddressed.
Metals
As the construction industry expands rapidly, a metal shortage will be imminent. Furthermore, high quality metal with standard sizes will become a rarity as well.
With the boom in construction industry, demolition of old constructions takes place more frequently. It is important to devise a plan to recycle and reuse such waste debris following a demolition.
For example, Galle Municipal Council has successfully up cycled debris waste and incorporated them in their constructions for more than 10 years. Galle Municipal council has set an ideal example to all other institutions in the country.
Reinforcement
The increasing demand for reinforcement causes a high competition in the market, which leads manufacturers to sell their products at economic rates. Industrial experts have warned that constructions that incorporate substandard reinforcement are likely to collapse in due course.
New technology
Sri Lanka is hesitant about going beyond traditional construction boundaries, and the situation has critically deterred the progress of all sectors including financial management, technology and project management.
In order to overcome this situation, the Construction Industry Development Authority should adopt stringent supervision, and uplift the industries with the collaboration of Contractors Union. In addition, it is also imperative to apply modern technology to alleviate problems related to raw material.
Furthermore, local contractors should be given an opportunity to collaborate with international firms when implementing foreign funded mega projects. Government's intervention is critical in such instances, which would help local contractors to enhance their knowledge, capabilities and skills.
Skilled labour
Currently Sri Lanka is experiencing a shortage in skilled labour. Due to this reason, local contractors find difficulty in meeting project deadlines.
According to the Central Bank reports, total value of construction contracts amount to Rs. 15 billion by 1995, while this value has increased to Rs. 200 billion by 2015, denoting a staggering increment of 1233%.
However, in contrast to this hike, the skilled labour has only increased by a mere 8%. To overcome this issue, vocational training subjects should be included in the school curriculum from a lower grade, and only teachers with special training should be assigned for the relevant subjects.
Even though there are majority of unemployed youth in the country with the potential to draw a higher income in the construction sector, it would be difficult to incorporate the youth without alleviating deep-rooted misconceptions regarding the construction industry.
The problem can be addressed to a great extent if the public and private sectors implement a joint program to address the issue on a broader perspective, present the recruits with new titles, uniforms, identity cards and offer bank loans while creating an employee-friendly working environment.
Regulation of constructions
The Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA) is responsible for regulating constructions within Sri Lanka. The institution is also involved in grading and registering contractors, training labourers and determining limitations of raw materials related to the construction industry.
However, in its effort to fulfill these responsibilities, the CIDA is observed to have been facing certain issues. As per the 2014 Clause 33 of the Construction Development Act, CIDA has been vested with the powers to properly regulate the construction industry.
However, the institute has not been able to perform as expected due to the lack of funds exclusively specified in the same Act.
Once the shortcomings are resolved, regulatory measures can commence. And the National Construction Association of Sri Lanka (NCASL) is ready to extend its fullest support at all times towards any task that supports the development of the construction industry.

Create Lab prepares children to thrive in 21st century
Create Lab, an education facilitator headquartered in Singapore provides the essential tools and facilities to assist children to develop digital skills and an inventive mindset, that will empower them to thrive in the 21st century.
Equipped with resources and expertise from educators from Oxford, MIT and Singapore's top universities, Create Lab Sri Lanka commenced operations in January this year.
Its coding and robotic design workshops have been recognized as Singapore's leading Computational Thinking enrichment programmes and these programmes caters to children in the age groups of 5 to 12 years.
Coding serves as the communication tool or the language that commands computers to execute tasks. It is the core aspect of creating all software including applications, websites and other digital tools.
With this ability to instruct computers to complete tasks comes the possibility of inventing virtual worlds inside the devices. Equipped with imagination and analytical thinking, this opens children to a world of unlimited possibilities.
"In an increasingly digitalized world, the skills that will usher in success are going to be one's ability to imagine, create, empathize and solve problems. By the time a primary school child of today enters the workforce, technology will be three hundred times more powerful.
Computer programming and coding skills are powerful tools that can stimulate and bring forth these already existing abilities within children. Coding helps children improve their analytical thinking and helps them look at the bigger picture. Empowering children to use technology to create rather than just consume, is what we do best." said Create Lab Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Thilan Wickramasinghe.
Create Lab workshops and programmes are designed to encourage children to explore possibilities and acquire skills through a 'hands on' personalized approach.
The learning environment provided at Create Lab includes role-playing, storytelling, art and music which challenge children to tackle everyday problems by developing solutions through their own computer programmes and hardware.
Commenting on the work that Create Lab has initiated in Sri Lanka, Create Lab Director, Michelle Pinto said, "Our main introductory programme Introduction to Computational Thinking (ICT101) will inspire students to become powerful computational thinkers. During our workshops, students can code their own computer games, digital art, programme robots and develop hardware.
Our focus is to inspire children to experiment, solve problems, identify patterns and use their imagination. These are highly portable skills that will help them excel in school and at home, but most importantly in their future careers."
The children are exposed to some of the state-of-the-art software and hardware solutions available and, Create Lab collaborates with the National University of Singapore (NUS) Enterprise, Google, SoftBank and the Infocomm and Media Development Authority of Singapore to develop their solutions.
Create Lab also provides free cloud based resources to allow children to share their work with family and friends and continue to improve their approaches, outside the classroom.

Dhawan explodes on opening day at Galle
Gunaratne breaks thumb - ruled out of Test:
GALLE: Sri Lanka found out for themselves yesterday  the first day of the first Test against India at the Galle International Stadium that playing against the lowest ranked Test team and the top ranked side there was a great divide.
The way Sri Lanka struggled to beat low rated Zimbabwe in the one-off Test, taking on number one ranked India proved a tad too big a task for them, especially with the present side that lacks a lot by way of experience.
The end result was that India who won the toss and took lease of a hard batting track posted an imposing first day score of 399 for three wickets with more to come today as they have batting as deep as upto number nine.
The day no doubt belonged to left-handed opener Shikhar Dhawan who played an explosive innings of 190 off 168 balls. For one moment one was left wondering whether Dhawan had got his priorities wrong and was playing in a fifty-over one-day international. Such was the intensity with which he dominated the Lankan bowling that his strike rate was a stunning 113 compared to his career rate of 60 in Tests.
The longer Dhawan stayed at the wicket the quicker the runs started to come. He completed his first fifty off 62 balls, his second fifty off 48 and his third off 37.
As long as Dhawan was at the wicket he made batting look so easy against pace and using his feet to the spinners to drive, sweep and cut with disdain that he reached the boundary on no less than 31 occasions.
The 126 runs he made between lunch and tea was the second-highest by an Indian in a single session of play. Virender Sehwag made 133 (of his 293) in the final session against Sri Lanka at the Brabourne Stadium in 2009. Dhawan who began on 64 after lunch finished with 190 at tea. Englands Denis Compton holds the record for the most runs scored in the middle session with 173 against Pakistan at Trent Bridge in 1954.
With Pujara who also made a hundred although not with the same aggression as Dhawan, the pair added 253 runs for the second wicket off 280 balls.
If Sri Lanka was to break this partnership it had to come from the batsmen making a mistake. With tea approaching Dhawan may have wanted a double century against his name at the break and in his haste to get there he tried to clear mid-off but instead hit the ball straight to Mathews who was stationed there.
With Dhawans dismissal the Indian scoring rate that was galloping at well over five an over assumed normal proportions, but still it was quite a healthy one as the end of the day showed. Dhawans last Test hundred was also at Galle  134 in August 2015 when India last toured but since then he has gone through 14 innings scoring only a solitary fifty. He was not in the original tour party but was drafted into the side following a recurrence of a wrist injury to Murali Vijay. Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane further dented the Lankan bowling putting together an unfinished stand of 113 by the close. Pujara scored his 12th Test hundred and second against Sri Lanka to remain not out on 144 scored off 246 balls with 12 fours and Rahane was on 39.
GUNARATNE INJURY
Sri Lanka could have snared Dhawan at 31 had Asela Gunaratne at second slip held onto the edge off Lahiru Kumara. Gunaratne not only put down Dhawan but also hurt himself and according to the teams cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha ruled himself out of the current Test.
Fears are that he would be out of the entire series as Xrays has revealed a fractured left thumb. Gunaratne was transferred to Colombo to undergo surgery.
Gunaratnes loss would be a big blow to Sri Lanka who are already without their Test captain Dinesh Chandimal - recovering from a bout of pneumonia. Gunaratne has turned out to be a utility cricketer with his ability to score runs and take wickets whenever the team needed it most across all formats.
On a day of hard toil Nuwan Pradeep stood tall for Sri Lanka capturing all three Indian wickets to fall for the day.
Pradeep returning to the side after a hamstring injury almost caused hearts to flutter in the Lankan camp when he lost his footing and nearly roled his right ankle in the 12th over of the innings. Thankfully it turned out to be nothing serious.
On a first day pitch with hardly any turn or help for the bowlers, India played the left-arm spin of Herath quite comfortably.
He is the main threat in the Lankan bowling line up and the Indian batsmen made him redundant by depriving him of a single wicket.
Sri Lanka gave a Test cap to Danushka Gunathilaka who took the place of Chandimal - making him the 140th Test player to represent the country. India debuted hard hitting all-rounder Hardik Pandya ahead of Rohit Sharma.

Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne has instructed the Drug Regulatory Authority(DRA) to look into the suitability of Dengue Prevention Vaccine call Dengvaxia introduced by France, since it has now accepted by number of countries.
Addressing the media at yesterdays Cabinet briefing, Co-Cabinet Spokesman, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne said that the Drug Regulatory Authority has the authority to introduce this vaccine by conducting chemical and clinical analysis. Chemical analysis would be conducted in laboratories and the clinical analysis will be done by a professor.
The Minister said that the introduction of the vaccine is a very slow process and approval will be granted after conducting a series of tests and comparing tests results with the reports of other countries since the professor should be responsible for any complication.
One year ago, the French Ambassador also discussed about this vaccine with me and then the vaccine was remained at research level in the Philippines with 52 percent success rate, the Minister added.
He added that the vaccine was also most effective in those who already have baseline immunity due to a previous dengue infection. It is more effective for those who had dengue previously. But, the vaccine has been approved in over 10 Countries and even Singapore had accepted it two weeks ago.

Dudley: Reluctant captain
The massive crowds, unprecedented in the history that gathered at the Old Parliament and Independence Square, created a sea of heads from Colombo One to Seven; it was filled with people who thronged to pay homage to their leader. The writer who joined the queue at Thunmulla a couple of days before that at mid, paid homage only around seven Oclock in the morning at Woodlands. Dudley was a man of integrity and a true Liberal Democrat. It was a fitting design for the final journey of an unassuming man who ruled the country not for his or for his kith and kins benefit.
Three leaders of United National Party who became heads of state during 1953-93, could be included in the long list of opponents who maligned, vilified, and disparaged the son of the Father of Nation in most deplorable manner on different occasions. These unjust insults and accusations, aiming to damage his reputation campaign started from the day Dudley became Prime Minister for the first time in March 1952, lasted until the last few days he was ailing at Durdans hospital prior to his departure on April 13, 1973.
Political carrier
Dudley Senanayakes political carrier began in 1936, when the 24-year-old Barrister returned from London to win Dedigama seat in the State Council. Seventeen years later, after serving as Deputy Minister, Minister and Prime Minister, he bid good bye to politics and after leading a spiritual life sans politics for four years. During this period Dudley was actively involved in spreading Buddhism in Germany. However, witnessing the UNPs debacle under Sir John Kotalawala at the 1956 general elections, and with the rank and file of the party demanding his return, Dudley was forced to re-enter politics in 1957.
The most valuable aspect of Dudley Senanayakes leadership is the agreement he entered into with the moderate Tamil leader Chelvanaykam in 1965it addressed several key concessions for the Northerners which included language, devolution and land matters. It was the Closest to a Lasting Solution of all such attempts.
Weak welfare economic policies by 1947-52 government saw a depletion of foreign reserves in 1952, compelling the government to totally withdrew the rice subsidy. [60 % of the staple food was imported at 72 cts. a measure, which was sold at 25 cents]. The leaders of two leftist parties, the LSSP and CP saw an opportunity, as tension grew among masses; they called for a Hartal on August 12.
In July 1953 a mass workers rally was organised by the Marxists who controlled 90 percent of trade unions to protest against moves by the government to prune the rice subsidy, a legacy of World War II. Young Marxist firebrands made inciting speeches at a rally held in the city to protest the move. The Hartal on August 12, 1953, turned out to be a fierce mass uprising. At the height of the disorder, a panicked government leadership withdrew to a Warship docked in Colombo, from where they carried out the state affairs.
Martial Law and curfew were imposed; Dudley Senanayake was singled out by the opposition and had to countenance most of the criticism.
On August 13, 1953; violent demonstrations in nine districts compelled a reluctant Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake to sign-- shoot at sight with impunitya painful decision for the sensitive man of 42 years. The rioting men and women stood disobediently; the Police opened fire causing nine deaths. A couple of months later he resigned from the post of Prime Minister, the leadership of United National Party and from politics altogether.
Unitary and stable Sri Lanka
The assassination of Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike in 1959 and the confused political environment led to the parliament being dissolved and an election being held in March 1960. Dudley was invited to form a government in a hung parliament. His unstable minority government lasted only a month. Later, in 1965 following an electoral success at general elections, he became PM for the fourth time in a coalition led by the UNP.
SenanayakeChelvanayakam Pact of 1965
Dudley, back in politics was in search of a lasting solution to the Language, Ethnic and Minority issues. The DudleyChelvanayakam Pact was signed between Senanayake, the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka and S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, leader of the Federal Party on March 24, 1965. Political analysts believe this unique agreement was a major progressive step towards a unitary and stable Sri Lanka.
Excerpts from the Text of the Pact.
Mr. Dudley Senanayake and Mr. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam met on March 24, 1965 and discussed matters relating to some problems over which the Tamil-speaking people were concerned, and Mr. Senanayake agreed that action on the following lines would be taken by him to ensure a stable government:
(01) Action will be taken early under the Tamil Language Special Provisions Act to make provision of the Tamil Language of Administration and of Record in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
Mr. Senanayake explained that it was the policy of his party that a Tamil-speaking person should be entitled to transact business in Tamil throughout the island.
(02) Mr. Senanayake stated that it was the policy of his party to amend the Languages of Courts Act to provide for legal proceedings in the Northern and Eastern Provinces to be conducted and recorded in Tamil.
(03)Action will be taken to establish District Councils in Ceylon vested with powers over subjects to be mutually agreed upon between two leaders. It was agreed, however, that the government should have power under the law to give directions to such councils under the national interest.
(04) The Land Development Ordinance will be amended to provide that citizens of Ceylon be entitled to the allotment of land under the Ordinance.
Mr. Senanayake further agreed that in the granting of land under colonisation schemes, the following priorities be observed in the Northern and Eastern provinces:
(A) Land in the Northern and Eastern provinces should in the first instance be granted to landless persons in the district.
(B) Secondly, to Tamil-speaking persons resident in the Northern and Eastern provinces.
(C) Thirdly, to other citizens in Ceylon, preference being given to Tamil citizens in the rest of the island.
The main opposition SLFP under Sirimavo, and strangely, the Marxists LSSP and CP joined hands in protest against the pact with the blessings of the Maha Sangha leading to abrogation of the pact. It was a settlement that could have re-enfranchised the Tamil-speaking citizens. Governments failure to rally sufficient support for it within the majority community in the South had disastrous consequences for the nation. Had it been put into action, Sri Lanka would have been a lively, peaceful nation. This pact illustrated Dudleys vision and insight to comprehend what was desirable to arrive at an adjustment with the minorities.
Dear father, I have decided to resign from the State Council- Dudley
 The two of us are under the same roof As your son, I find it difficult to act in this manner. Sometimes I cannot agree with some of the proposals made by you to the State Council on behalf of the Board of Ministers. On many occasions, I have to steadfastly oppose you. Such a thing happened today also. It caused me severe mental distress. So I have decided to resign from the State Council. Dudley.
A young minister once wrote to father DS, for the senior Senanayake to reply allowing the son full freedom to oppose him at the Cabinet criticize him openly; lessons for present generation of politicians who think their word should be the final and the rest would have little say....but follow the leader or face consequences.
A bachelor captained fathers XI against sons at St Thomas in 1963
In April 1963, the man who left no offspring and heir to carry the Senanayake name played for a Fathers Cricket XI. Dudley, the then Leader of the Opposition, took part in a by St Thomas Preparatory, Bandarawela, when the sons played against the fathers. I do not know by what stretch of the imagination they have included me in this team, Dudley the bachelor chuckled. Perhaps for the man who captained St Thomas in his early thirties, temptation to play the game was too strong to resist, so he accepted the invitation and played.

Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake says that he will give proper answers to the statements made against him when he appears before the Presidential Commission probing the Central Bank Bond Issue on August 2.
The minister points out that there is a secret scheme behind these activities to mar his character.
Minister Karunanayake was speaking to journalists at an event held to mark the National Youth Flag Day yesterday. The Colombo District Group of the National Youth Council pinned a commemorative flag on Minister Karunanayake during the event at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Minister Karunanayake further said: Nothing has happened to those of the previous regime who destroyed this country. But, a minister of our Government goes before an Independent Commission. This is the transparency of the rule of the Good Governance. Didnt they know that I am a Cabinet Minister to summon me before the Commission on July 25.
I was summoned on the day where I had a commitment to attend the Cabinet Meeting. Therefore, I informed the Commission through my lawyers to allocate another day. These things were publicly talked about in Parliament seven or eight months ago. There is nothing to hide. Two or three media institutions are trying to tarnish my image for no reason. They have nothing else to show. Therefore, they are involved in these kind of things. I will answer before the Commission regarding these matters at the correct time. Then, the truth will be revealed to the entire county, Minister Karunanayake said.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will open the exhibition for public at 6 p.m. today. Except today the exhibition will be held from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. and there will be musical shows on each day.
The main aim of the exhibition is to make the people aware of social and economic revolution created by the open economy introduced by the 1977 UNP Government under the guidance of former President J.R.Jayewardene.
Sri Lanka was the first country in Asia to introduce the open economy. With the introduction of the open economy, it could be observed many revolutionary changes in the social and economic aspects, Minister Hashim said.
As an outcome of the open economy, the country was subjected to a rapid economic and social development. Accordingly, Free Trade Zones (FTZ), which created thousands of employment opportunities, were also introduced, modern communication systems including mobile technology and television broadcasting system and many more were introduced. Moreover, Sri Lankans can obtain foreign employments as a fruitful outcome of the open economy, he said.
He added that the agriculture based economy prevailed in the country before 1977 was replaced with the production based economy with the implementation of the open economy. However, the Minister noted that the Government has planned to introduce the social economy system instead of an open economy.

EZY Wolves, Sri Lanka Super 7s Leg 2 heroes
EZY Wolves unleashed a ferocious brand of rugby to outplay the defending champs Mobitel Eagles 26-12 to win the Cup Championship in Leg 2 of the Sri Lanka Super 7s series.
The EZY Wolves who had an ordinary outing in the 1st Leg in Kandy, unveiled an entertaining brand of rugby right from the first whistle of their secodnleg first pool game against the Walkers Vipers, to defeat them by 31 points to 12.
Thereafter EZY went onto dominate the days play by winning comprehensively against the Cargills Gladiators to fight the Mobitel Eagles 21 Points to 24, thereby taking the lead on the Group A.
Thereafter the EZY Wolves went on to comfortably beat the Softlogic Warriors 24-12 in the quarters and Cargills Gladiators 17-10 to enter the final against the Mobitel Eagles who had won the 1st Leg in Kandy a week before.
More known for their prowess in motor racing, EZY Wolves who are owned by the founding CEO of EZY Racing, Shafraz Hamzadeen, displayed some of the inspiration through their speedsters Dinusha Chathuranga, Sudam Sooriyaarachchi and Kenyan National star Nelson Oyoo, who scored a bulk of the tries to provide EZY Wolves a clear advantage over the other teams.
The Wolves who were previously beaten on two occasions by the Mobitel Eagles, once by 2 points and another time by 3 points were the clear underdogs in the final. However, Sudarshana Muthuthantri lead the team of EZY Wolves as they played with vengeance and clearly demonstrated their passion and grit through superiority in defense, attack and decision making to come out victorious.
Speaking after the game, Muthuthantri stated that they made a master move in starting Kenyan captain Andrew Amonde off the bench and moving speedster Dinusha Chathuranga into the forwards that provided them speed at each end.
This clearly played off when playmaker Chanaka Chandimal changed the direction to provide a long pass to Chathuranga who ran over 60 meters to score under the post in a crucial moment in the first half.
We had a leadership team comprising of a few locals and foreigners. We came up with the game plan for the final where we decided to put two Kenyans in the back line to add strength to our defence. We also moved Chanaka (Chandimal) to Center from his usual fly half position to allow better ball movement. This paid off.
Muthuthantri who demonstrated passion and exemplary leadership skills was later awarded the player of the tournament.
The tournament, which takes into count, the points accumulated in both Legs to award the overall winner, found EZY Wolves finishing Runner-up to Mobitel Eagles in the overall standings. However, the EZY Wolves clearly left a lasting impression in the minds of thousands of spectators with their passionate brand of rugby.

The growth of football in Sri The growth of football in Sri Lanka Lanka
Football is perhaps one of the most popular sports in the world, which was introduced to us by the Europeans. From the early years of barefoot competition to the present age of sophisticated football, Sri Lanka has played a vital role in its growth and it is known here as the poor mans sport.
It is not possible to say exactly, when football was introduced to Ceylon, as it was then called, because here again, the origins are out, literally in the mists of time. However, there is evidence of the game being played in the sprawling sandy stretches familiarly termed as the Galle Face Green, by bare footed British servicemen stationed in and around Colombo in the 1890s.
The Service barrack grounds at Echelon Square, the present Hotel Galadari premises, and the Army rugger grounds, the present premises of Taj Samudra Hotel, were the popular football fields.
British service units such as the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, Royal Engineers, Royal Artillery and the Royal Garrison Command were the pioneers who promoted competitive football in this country. The British administrative service and the British planting community took the sport to the Central, Up-Country and Southern areas with equal zest and fervor. By early 1900 football as a competitive sport, was popular among the local youth. Though playing bare footed, our lads had mastered the skills, and in fact donned the service jerseys as replacements or reserves in many an exclusively white dominated team.
It was in Colombo that the first Association of Football League was formed, at the Bristol Hotel. In April 1911 H. French was elected the President with H. K. Crosskey as the Secretary. And during the World War I the sport became inactive and once again in 1920 the Colombo Association Football League was revived and named as Colombo Football League, with Herbert Debugging as President.
Then in 1918 the Colombo Mercantile Association Football League was formed and followed by the Government Services Football Association. The City Football League was inaugurated in 1922. Somewhere in the 1920s the Southern Province Football Association was formed, mainly due to the keenness of R. Brough, a British tea planter in Deniyaya. He formed the Galle Association Football Club.
In the 1930s football was introduced in Kandy. That was during the Second World War, when the British units were stationed in Kandy, with the one-time Commander in Chief of the Allied Forces in South East Asia. Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten having his headquarters in Kandy. By the 1930s many clubs played the game and in the early 1940s the Kandy Amateur Football League was formed and later it was changed to Kandy District Football League, and it served football not only in Kandy but also in places like Gampola, Nawalapitiya, Hatton, Matale, Kurunegala and Kegalle. As years passed by the game became popular, and they formed their own leagues. In 1939 the Jaffna Football Association was formed with W. G. Spencer, as the head. Then in the 50s, the game got off to a start in Anuradhapura.
With the sport taking a keen interest, there was a need of a national controlling body for the game. With several meetings, in which people like Sir John Tarbat, R. H. Marks, C. W. Mackie, R. Mackie, Donovan Andree to name a few, met on several occasions, and finally had a meeting, and the national body for football was formed under the name of Ceylon Football Association, the meeting place was the Galle Face Hotel, and the following were elected: Sir John Tarbat (Patron), C. W. Mackie (President), J. C. Robinson, J. Forbes, S. C. Traill, R. Brough and Lt. Col. Stanley Fernando as Vice Presidents, R. Mackie Secretary, Donovan Andree Treasurer. The election took place during the second World War.
Today there are many leagues, but not properly governed by the controlling body, only a few clubs are seen kicking and passing the ball. Holding office is not a big thing; one must come forward and promote the game like in the past.

H.I.K. was  tagged Asias Best Stumper
In my last two columns I covered with pleasure SPORTS LEGENDS, BIG BEN NAVARATNE and MAHESH RODRIGO. Both wicket keepers were of international class and I also reproduced the compliments paid to them by the greatest batsman that the world had seen ,and will ever see, Australian Sir Donald Bradman and famous Australian cricketer and reputed cricket journalist Jack Fingleton.
And today we pay tribute to another great wicket keeper of the pre Test cricket era Herbert I.K.Fernando of St.Peters College, Bambalapitiya which has produced many outstanding cricketers. Besides HIK there was that shining star the let handed CLIVE INMAN who still holds the record of scoring a double hundred in the Peterite-Josephian Big Match.
FERNANDO was born in Jaffna as his father was a police officer attached to the Jaffna police. FERNANDO who shone in his studies also showed a keen interest and love as a budding cricketer. Surprisingly when FERNANDO came to Colombo his first school as a junior, believe it or not ,was to a girls school, Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya.
It was no surprise then that he joined the school at the opposite side St.Peters College, where his love for studies and cricket began to blossom and bloom. FERNANDO served notice of his natural talent as a wicket keeper/batsman at a very early age and had the fortune of coming under the expert coaching and guidance of Shelton Wirasinghe, Russel Heyn and the one and only Herbert Wittachchy
Right style of batting
Today coaches of this caliber are hard to find. They taught FERNANDO the right style of batting. Play straight and dont indulge and play the cross bat shot unless the ball is pitched way outside the leg stump. Firstly get your eye in before launching. FERNANDO a stylish right hand batsman was blessed with an array of strokes and when he took on the bowlers however good they were, he would pierced the field and runs flowed freely. He was a treat to watch and many schoolboy bowlers feared him. Many were the big scores he made which are too numerous to mention.
In addition to his classic batting, it was his wicket keeping that shone like a beacon. Blessed with a good eye and quick reflexes he would stand up to the wicket be it to pacemen or spinners. His gloves seemed to have glue in them as he took incredible catches standing up or diving either side.
My first glimpse of him was as a 10 year old when I watched in amazement the big 100 he made against my old school St. Benedicts College, Kotahena in if my memory serves me right in 1950 or 1951. Being a cricket fanatic that knock made me dream of being a batsman of his caliber. He captained the school by the canal with great success and distinction.
After a highly successful school career he joined the Nondescripts Cricket Club where his fame and fortune grew making big runs and keeping brilliantly. And it did not take the selectors of that era to plonk him in to the national team. Fernando won his national colours in 1953 when he gloved against Lindsay Hassetts Australians at the Colombo Oval and enjoyed and still remembers his first victim when he stumped another of his kind the famous Don Tallon.
Vicious off spin by Abu Fuard
Fernando captained the Board Presidents X1 against Joe
Lister X1 and restricted that strong batting line up to 164 thanks to some vicious off spinning by Abu Fuard who captured six wickets.
Fernando after captaining the NCC later joined medical college and passed out as a doctor. In 1961 he said adieu to the Maitland Place Club and threw in his lot with the Sri Lanka Army and continued his cricketing career with great success.
During his reign he earned kudos when he was tagged the best wicket keeper in Asia, beating some top keepers that India and Pakistan had which was a great honour to the country. After his retirement from the game he served as selector, coached his Alma Mater and was also a radio cricket commentator.
FERNANDO in 1963 was commissioned to the regular Army and held the rank of Brigadier in 1986 as Director of Welfare and Rehabilitation. He was instrumental in establishing the Ranaviru Sevana at Ragama. FERNANDO obtained his Diploma in Anesthetics of Royal College of Surgeons in England. He retired from the Army in 1995. He is one of the nicest guys you could meet.
FERNANO was a pride to Sri Lanka cricket

Our market share was around 15% in 2015 and this now increased to 25% in 2016. Currently, we command over 30% market share and our target is to end 2018 with 40% share and to be the market leader in Sri Lanka. Asked to comment on the gray market he said it was not a major issue.
We deal with 'dealers' and we hardly have an issue in this area.

I will take maximum effort to prevent cruelty to animals: Faiszer
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said he would take maximum effort to prevent cruelty to animals.
The minister made this observation when he met representatives of organisations campaigning for the prevention of cruelty to animals at the ministry.
The representatives arrived in a protest march against the killing of stray dogs in the Sri Jayawardenapura and Moratuwa campuses.
The minister said that there is an organised campaign to blame and discredit him with regard to stray dogs being killed in the country. He said, "I am used to brick brats as well as praise being showered on me.
This is a Sinhala Buddhist country. If animals are slaughtered, it is essential to complain to the authorities to conduct an investigation into the matter.
There are provisions in the law to investigate such matters." Minister Musthapha said holding placards and chanting slogans on the streets will not solve the problem.
"Anyone can make representations and have discussions on the issues with me," he said.

Judge refutes Police spokesman
SAYS views irresponsible:
Jaffna High Court Judge, M. Ilancheliyan yesterday refuted claims made by the Police Media spokesperson, SP Ruwan Gunasekara that the shooting incident in Jaffna was not aimed at him but was a mere coincidence.
Speaking to the media at the funeral of slain SI Sarath Hemachandra yesterday, the judge stressed that the Police media spokespersons views on the case were irresponsible and need not have been made before a full investigation was concluded into the incident.The funeral of the fallen Policeman Sarath Premachandra took place in his hometown Kumarakattuwa, Chilaw with full Police honours.
As the prime witness, I can say that this was targetted at me and the two police officers fought to protect my life; one officer sacrificed his life and another is injured, the High Court Judge said.
Judge Ilancheliyan further attributed SP Gunasekaras statements as an attempt to mislead the investigation and interfere with a court case, No one can interfere with this court case. A B Report has been submitted to the Jaffna Magistrates Courts, so anyone trying to divert the case is in contempt of court, he added.
On Saturday (22), an altercation between the suspects and the police officers attached to the security of the judge who were trying to settle it, resulted in a shooting where one of the officers was injured and the other fatally wounded. The police have thus far managed to arrest three suspects connected to the shooting, one of them; 39 year old Selvarasa Jayandan is the main suspect in the case. The latter surrendered him to the Police on Tuesday (25).
With the Police stating that the shooting was not pre-planned, the judge was of the opinion that the Police were aiding the case of the Defence.
You cannot reveal the statement made by the accused during an investigation and in a court of law confessions are inadmissible he said.
I had gone in my official car on an official visit with uniformed escorts. If they wanted to kill a Policeman in particular he could have targeted one of the many hanging around in Jaffna, why did the suspect interfere with my trip the Judge questioned.
The spokesperson behaved like a judge and delivered the judgment, the Judge further stated.
According to sources, the suspect had joined the LTTE in 1994 at the age of 16. He is also suspected of being connected to a murder which had taken place in Jaffna during 2012. Police say the latest incident had occurred while is was out on bail for the previous murder case.

LTTE to remain on EUs terrorism list despite ECJs ruling
The European Union (EU) has taken note of the European Court of Justices (ECJs) judgement annulling measures against the LTTE, namely the designation of the LTTE as a terrorist organisation and the freezing of LTTE funds.
The judgment is a legal ruling of the European Court of Justice on the procedure used for listing the LTTE. It does not involve any assessment by the Court of the substantive reasons for the designation of the LTTE as a terrorist organisation.
The annulled measures cover the period 2011-2015. Designations of the LTTE adopted by the Council later in 2015-2017 are not covered by the present ruling. This means that the LTTE remains listed as a terrorist organisation by the EU, an official statement said.
EU institutions systematically review their practices following rulings of the European Court of Justice. The current ruling will be carefully analysed. Any necessary remedial action will be taken to adjust the listings to these procedural requirements and to ensure legally robust designations.
In summary, the European Union continues to consider the LTTE as a terrorist organisation and the EUs restrictive measures against the LTTE remain in force.

Ballerina is a new integration language by middleware giants, WSO2. According to Sudaraka Jayashanka, CTO and Chief Architect at Mitra Innovation- a Sri Lankan/UK company specialising in Cloud integration, digital transformation, and product incubation -it is the first ever appealing integration programming language built specifically for system integration.
To coincide with the development and soft launch of Ballerina, WSO2 organised a Hackathon in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 22 July, where teams of developers could test its capabilities in real-life development situations.
WSO2 said that the aim of the hackathon was for a few passionate programmers to take Ballerina for a twirl, push it to its limits and give valuable feedback. Feedback could encompass identifying bugs and providing suggestions for improvements.
To take part in the Hackathon, participants had to apply and submit a real-life proposal for a problem that needed to be fixed, using a solution involving Ballerina.WSO2 selected 25 teams from many entrants. Two of the successful teams chosen - Team Oxygen and Team Cybus - were from Mitra Innovation, a preferred partner of WSO2, and a company with a strong commitment to open source initiatives.
Both teams were also useful to WSO2 as they identified bugs, and made suggestions that could improve the Ballerina language.
At the end of the day, WSO2 chose three teams who had not only submitted great proposals, but who had effectively demonstrated the power of Ballerina, as well as contributed the most in terms of feedback.
Mitra Innovation were very successful on the day as their employees made up two of the three teams.
WSO2 has developed another great tool, and Mitra Innovation were honoured to take part, and thrilled to be amongst the winners.

New primary issuance system for Treasury bonds
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka will introduce a new primary issuance system for Treasury bonds (T-bonds).
Effective today, the new system replaces the existing fully auction based issuance system for T-bonds that has been in practice since February 2015.
The main purpose of introducing the new system is to further enhance the efficiency and transparency of the domestic borrowings of the Government. The new system is more structured and includes regular monthly T-bond auctions. Each monthly auction offers two T-bond series of different maturities and tenures of the series are expected to match the resource availability in the market.
Issuance under each series takes effect in three or less sequential phases depending on the outcome of each preceding phase.
Phase I explores issuance of the entire announced volume in a competitive multiple price auction system through reasonable market bids. However, in the event of any under allocation at Phase I, the Phase II opens for voluntary, volume based bidding.
Issuance under Phase II is made at Weighted Average Yield Rate (WAYR) determined at Phase I and is limited to any under allocation at Phase I vis-a-vis the offered amount. If oversubscribed, Public Debt Department issuance at Phase II takes effect proportionate to performance of auction participants at Phase I.
All Primary Dealers (PDs) and other authorized participants at primary issuances are eligible for submission of bids under Phase II.
At Phase III, any under allocation at Phase I and Phase II, if any, is issued on a mandatory basis at WAYR only among PDs. However, execution of Phase III will only be limited to instances where accepting 60 per cent of the offered amount in minimum at Phase I.
Issuance at Phase III to any PD is inversely proportionate to its ratio of success at Phase I and Phase II.
In addition, a new performance review mechanism will be introduced to assess the effective participation of PDs.
Meanwhile, in order to improve the investment planning of PDs and investors at large, a quarterly T-bond auction calendar will be published in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka website in advance.

Accordingly, the Government moved five Orders under the Special Commodity Levy Act, a Resolution under the Customs Ordinance and Nation Building Tax (Amendment) Bill amidst heavy disturbances from the Opposition.
MEP Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena objecting to Kiriella, stated that Minister Faiszer Musthapha was present in the House to reply to a question raised by him on a previous date and that the minister should be allowed to read his reply before proceeding to the main business of the House. However, Kiriella maintained that there was no suitable atmosphere to make a ministerial statement due to the unruly behaviour of JO MPs.
The seven items listed on the Order Paper were moved one by one by the Speaker amidst objections by the JO and JVP. Kiriella read out amendments to the National Building Tax Bill at the Committee stage and the Speaker announced the Bill was passed. Following the passage of legislation, the Speaker immediately adjourned Parliament around 3.30pm till 10.30 am today.
MEP leader agitates against Gazette Extraordinary
Parliament was to take up a full day's debate today on the Gazette Extraordinary issued by the President at midnight Tuesday, proclaiming all services relating to the supply and distribution of fuel as an essential public service.
The decision was taken by the Parliament Business Committee headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, following a tense situation in Parliament yesterday.
Joint Opposition members led by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena agitated in the House over a statement by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, explaining the reasons that led to the issuance of the Gazette Extraordinary.
Speaker Jayasuriya who repeatedly warned the MPs to take their seats and stop disrupting the proceedings, was forced to temporarily suspend sittings around 2.20pm amidst chaos created by JO MPs.
As House resumed sittings at 3.05 pm, the House heated up once again when the news broke on the arrest of CPC Trade Unionists. Both the JO and JVP urged for the intervention of the Premier to have them released. The Prime Minister replying to these concerns, said none of the TU members would be detained, adding that they would be allowed to leave after their recording statements were recorded.
JO members also made a din in the House shouting at the Government that the striking workers of the CPC were being attacked by a gang of thugs near the Kolonnawa oil tanks. The Premier refuting such claims, stressed the Government would tackle the situation without any bloodshed. This is not Weliweriya, but Kolonnawa. We do not shoot at anybody. I came to know there had been certain incidents near the gate of the Kolonnawa tanks as some persons were not allowed to enter. The Police had used tear gas at that instance, the Premier said.
Wickremesinghe repeatedly questioned the JO as to why they did not protest when the Hambantota oil tanks were vested under the Ports Authority and not the CPC by the former regime led by Mahinda Rajapaksa. The oil tanks within the Hambantota Port premises were given to the Ports Authority by the previous regime. It was not our decision. You were ministers of the then Cabinet. Why did you not protest he questioned.
No sufficient proof that JMO handed over body parts to SAITM: Govt.
The Government yesterday stated there had no sufficient proof to claim that former Colombo Chief Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) handed over certain human body parts to SAITM after the postmortem examination.
Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake made this observation, replying to a question raised by MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara in Parliament.
Minister Karunathilake further said action could be taken against any official who had made any statement contrary to the above.
MP Nanayakkara said the revelation that the Colombo Chief JMO handed over certain human body parts to SAITM, came up during investigations carried out by the Government. However, the Government denied that there had been any such proof.
Minister Karunathilake also rejected the claim that Sri Lanka Police had handed over certain human body parts to SAITM, adding that the Police had no authority to do so sans a Court order.
Disruption results in temporary suspension of Parliament

Piramal Glass 1Q profit after tax dips to Rs 105 mn
Piramal Glass Ceylon PLC has announced its results for the first quarter of the 2017-18 financial year with Rs. 1,403 million in revenue and Rs. 105 million in profit after tax showing a marginal decline when compared with the profitability of the first quarter of the 2016-17 financial year.
The sale during the first three months of FY 2017-18 was Rs. 1,403 million, which reflects a de-growth of 17% when compared to the similar period of previous year
Domestic sales stood at Rs. 1,084 million as against Rs. 1,346 million of the similar quarter in the previous year, reflecting a de-growth of 19%.
A dip in the overall domestic market was experienced which impacted sales in all segments. The export sales for the quarter was at Rs. 319 million as against Rs. 338 million received in the similar quarter of the previous year.
The major decline in the export market was from exports to India due to the changes in the tax structure with the announcement of GST implementation in that country. All other geographical locations, namely, Australia, USA and Canada have showed positive growth figures during the period under review. Amidst the adverse sales impact the company showed marked improvement in its profitability indicators.
The gross profit during the quarter under review was 25% as compared to 18% in the similar quarter whilst the operating profit moved up to 15% from 9% of the previous year.
The incremental operational profit margin improvement was possible due to the reduction of trading sales. With the new facility now well stabilised, the domestic market is being supplied mainly with in-house manufactured bottles which has replaced the imported bottles. Last year due to capacity constraints a considerable portion of domestic sales was done through imports.

Pitch  perfect
She came, she he sang and she conquered hearts. 23 year old Luksimi Sivaneswaralingam is now a well known voice in the South Indian music industry.
The gifted vocalist of Sri Lankan Tamil origin got the opportunity to debut as a playback singer in the South Indian music industry in 2016. She became the first Sri Lankan Tamil to sing a full film song for the music director D. Imman in the upcoming Tamil supernatural thriller movie Bogan directed by Lakshman. The film is produced by Prabhu Deva on behalf of Prabhu Deva Studios and stars popular actors like Jayam Ravi, Hansika, and Aravid Swami. The song has crossed 4 million views in such a short span, and has reached the number one slot on the iTunes India.
Social media has played an immense role in my opportunity of singing for Bogan. I never imagined that uploading a few clips of myself singing on Instagram would bring me such an opportunity! Since Senthoora was my debut song for this project I was very nervous going into my recording but I was excited as well because I got a gift of an opportunity. Imman sir was very encouraging throughout the recording process and gave me the space to add my own western flavour and touches to best embellish the song. My favourite moments were working with sir and lyricist Thamarai in my recording, and being at the audio launch. I was also very happy to have heard lyricist Madhan Karky say that Senthoora was his favourite song from the movie soundtrack, Luksimi recalled with a smile.
During a Carnatic performance
However Senthoora was not her debut film song. She had sung her first film song, Valimeethu, the title song for the Tamil Canadian movie Appa in 2008.
Luksimi began her music journey as a Carnatic vocal student at the age of three, performing and taking part in Carnatic vocal competitions. She also took up lessons in bharathanatyam, veena and the piano, and later Western classical vocals and other popular genres of singing. She completed her Bharathanatyam Arangetram in 2013. Since then she has performed and competed at several events in Canada and on the international scale. Luksimi has had the opportunity to sing for albums, and radio jingles.
My mom had introduced me to my guru Smt. Kamaladevy Shanmugalingam, who had not only taught me music but also discipline and many other skills that have shaped me into who I am today. When I was in high school, I knew I wanted to pursue full-time and professionally, so I began training with a private vocal coach. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto, with a Bachelor of Music - Voice Performance. I was quite fortunate to have several professionals and my private voice teacher guided me through the intricate techniques to use when singing and how to maintain a healthy voice. My voice teacher at the university was great, because she helped me find a common bridge between western and eastern styles of singing, Luksimi explained.
During a performance
The versatile vocalist was born and raised in Toronto, Canada. She completed her undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Music  Voice Performance (Western classical), where she also took courses relevant to music education and vocal pedagogy. She completed her post graduate degree in music education at Wilfrid Laurier University recently.
Every singer has unique and distinctive qualities to their voice that make them unique. This helps them create their own identity. My style of singing and voice links the western and Indian styles of music. Though Ive been formally trained in Carnatic and Western classical vocals, I like to explore my ability in various genres of singing as I believe its important to be a versatile singer, Luksimi expressed adding that she can sing fluently in Tamil, English, Hindi, German, Italian, French and Latin.
She has received several awards for her achievements in the fine arts, academics, and community service. She won the first place at the international Innisai Kural 2006 competition in Canada and UK. She was also one of the Top five finalists in both Tvi Super Star Season 2, and Super Star Challenge, an international vocal competition in Singapore where she competed against India, Malaysia, Singapore, and Sri Lanka. Renowned singers and music directors like K J Yesudas, S Janaki, Chinamayi, T L Maharajan, German Kannan, and many others have comprised the jury at such events. She was also the vocal coach for TVi Super Star Junior Season 4.
Performing during the round one for SuperStar Challenge held in Canada
She has bagged the Ontario Volunteer Service Award, Tamils Information Award (Thamizhar Valikaati), and several other accolades. She was given the title Natya Kala Jyothi in 2013 for her achievements in Bharathanatyam. Recently, she won the Youth Icon Award at the Ninaivukal Night 2017, and was chosen to be featured on the Ninaivukal Magazine Cover. She has also been featured on albums produced by Steve Cliff Valentine and Kapileshwer Kathir and has performed on stage with many accomplished international artistes.
There are several people who have inspired me over the years, and continue to inspire me every day. I enjoy following their music, their experiences, and values as a guide to my own journey in music. I am quite fortunate to have supportive and encouraging parents who have been by my side through all the ups and downs throughout my journey. My parents, especially my mom, have a deep passion and interest for the fine arts, she noted adding that as a child she had been surrounded by music in her home. Her family would always listen to classical and film songs, and watch music related shows and videos of concerts. Over the years and even now, Luksimi has grown up watching great musicians and legends that have been great inspirations to her, musically. She says that she admires their uniqueness, values and humble personalities, and their drive, mindset and focus to achieving their goals and dreams.
Luksimi has worked independent tracks post Bogan, and has recorded for songs that can be pitched for films.
Her ambition is to continue playback singing and performing while balancing her career as an educator. She wishes to become a professor in music and practice music therapy. She hopes to use music as a tool to assist child with special needs.
Her advice to those who wish to excel in singing is to strive to learn because music is similar to an ongoing ocean with lots to explore. There is so much to learn from fellow artistes and musicians that will only allow budding young vocalists to grow.
Performing at Desi Fest 2016 n Toronto, Canada
Dream big and work hard to achieve it. Anything is possible if you put your mind and heart to it! Stay true to yourself and use the failures as a stepping stone to reach success. Perseverance, time management skills, and a strong support system are essential. Choosing to follow an undefined path is a challenging feat. No matter what obstacles you face, they teach you valuable lessons along the way. Do not stop believing in yourself and your passion for your trade. The sky will always be the limit, she opined.
Luksimi will be performing at Immans live concert in London in September. Several other projects are also under way.

Pradeep picks maiden five-wicket haul in India Test

Paceman Nuwan Pradeep clinched his maiden five-wicket haul as Sri Lanka clawed back at a runaway India on day two of the first Test in Galle on Thursday.
Pradeep (5-88) dismissed Cheteshwar Pujara for 153, triggering a batting collapse which saw the tourists lost four wickets in a lively first session after resuming at 399-3.
At lunch, the top-ranked visitors were 503-7, with Test debutant Hardika Pandya batting on four alongside Ravindra Jadeja (eight).
Pujara, whose 253-run stand for the second wicket with opener Shikhar Dhawan (190) put India on track for a huge first innings total, was caught behind off Pradeep, the pick of Sri Lankan bowlers.
Pujara struck 13 fours in his 265-ball knock to match his previous Test best of 153 against South Africa at Johannesburg in 2013.
Ajinkya Rahane (57) looked solid but was sent back to the pavilion after Madhushanka Karunaratne dived for a low catch on his right side off fast bowler Lahiru Kumara.
Ravichandran Ashwin and Wriddhiman Saha struck back with a sixth-wicket stand of 59, but India's counter attack unravelled as Sri Lanka dismissed the duo in the space of six balls.
Ashwin (47) fell short of a well-deserved half-century while Saha (16) became the first victim of Sri Lankan captain Rangana Herath (1-125).

A prudent step
The Government has taken the prudent step in declaring Petroleum distribution an Essential Service from Midnight yesterday, in the face of the crippling strike launched by disruptive elements working to a political agenda. With the gazetting of the Essential Services order the security forces were deployed to facilitate the transport and distribution of fuel from Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela refineries to the dealers throughout the country.
As a responsible government the regime could not sit by and watch when normal life is torn asunder and the public are put into great hardship and peril. The wrath of the people naturally are directed at the government at such times, never mind the pros and cons of the issues involved and the first task of the government is to alleviate the suffering of the public and restore normalcy in civilian life.
It is patently clear that the strikers are being backed to the hilt by political elements seeking a shortcut to power they lost at the ballot by provoking the anger of the public against the government. In this bid they do not care a whit for the hardship and ordeals endured by the public. It is also obvious that the Petroleum strike, as well as the frequent GMOA work stoppages, are sustained with massive financial backing off the ill gotten earnings of the former VVIPs and with the governments delay to seek out and trace the accumulated loot these strikes are bound to escalate and heap more hardships on the public. Hence the need for a concerted effort by the government to pursue in earnest the corruption investigations that are now stalled or are in abeyance so that the current malaise could be traced to their source.
Now that it has shown it means business, the government should not hesitate to similarly deal firmly with other work stoppages and disruptions caused to public life and demonstrate to the public that there is governance in the country.
The reality for the JO
Transport Minister and SLFP stalwart Nimal Siripala De Silva could not have put it better when he remarked that attempts (by the JO) to topple the government was only a pipe dream, going on to quote chapter and verse from the relevant section from the 19th amendment to the constitution in this regard, as reported in our front page on Tuesday. According to the Minister, the JO will have to wait for another full three years to entertain any hopes of effecting a regime change. One option was to hope that the President would, indeed, have a change of heart and decides to accommodate the JO in forming a SLFP led government.
Assuming that this is so, it will be a long wait, in fact a full two and a half years, by virtue of the restriction imposed by the 19th amendment on the President to dissolve parliament until after four and half years into its term. On the other hand the Joint Opposition will need to muster a two thirds majority in the present parliament in order to circumvent this requirement and topple the government on its own. Presently, it has just 51 members in parliament in the 225 member legislature and will need another 100 MPs to reach the coveted figure, which, to quote the Minister, is a pipe dream. Even if the claim that 18 members from the mainstream SLFP are to break ranks and join their lot it will be a Hymalian task, to put it mildly, for the JO to reach the target.
With the Provincial Council elections now being put off and no national level election in the horizon it is difficult to imagine any member of the government(from the SLFP) throwing in their lot with the JO or sitting as Independents in parliament. Perhaps, the rumour of a possible crossover was being floated by members of the JO to coincide with the impending PC elections with the hope that this would attract the so called disgruntled elements within the SLFP. In any event, should there be crossovers at this juncture the prospects would indeed be bleak for those joining the other side. For one thing, they would be compelled to vegetate for two and half years sans all perks and privileges. For another, they would not be forgiven by the SLFP voters for sitting with the enemy in parliament, thus killing their chances of re-election from whichever party the JO decides to contest. There is also the very real possibility, that, in the event they decide to sit as Independents in parliament, of disciplinary action being taken against them by the SLFP, leading to their ouster from parliament.
Another two and half years down the road is a long time in politics and it is difficult to contemplate what configurations the present political scenario would take at the end of this period. It is also possible that the stature of Mahinda Rajapaksa would be largely diminished given that investigations into mega corruption of the Rajapaksas could begin any time soon in dead earnest.

Rajitha says Ryan Jayalath arrest attempt unacceptable
Nobody can approve of the manner in which an attempt was made to arrest the Convener of the Medical Students Action Committee Ryan Jayalath, said Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senartne.
Addressing the Cabinet press briefing yesterday, the Minister said that these kind of incidents would put the government in to difficulty.
I immediately called the IGP and questioned about the manner in which he was arrested. Ryan Jayalath was no Rohana Wijeweera to arrest him in such a manner. The police executed the orders of the Court; there were five warrants against Jayalath. The Crime Investigative Department officials have power to go in Civvies and arrest him, but Ryan could have been easily arrested,the Minister said.
When questioned as to whether there was any conspiracy behind it, the Minister said that only the government had changed and not the state.
Police Media Spokesperson ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said the IGP had already informed Western Province Senior DIG to conduct an investigation to ascertain whether there was a discrepancy regarding the official duties.
The DIG would submit the report in two or three days. If the report states that there was a discrepancy regarding the official duty, disciplinary action will be taken against those officials, he said.

Roland Jones to make England Test debut
London: Middlesex paceman Toby Roland-Jones will make his England Test debut against South Africa on Thursday after Mark Wood was ruled out with injury.
Durham fast bowler Wood missed Wednesday's final training session for the third Test with an ongoing heel problem that had troubled him in England's 340-run defeat by South Africa in the second Test, a result that saw the Proteas level the four-match series at 1-1.
"Wood is not 100 percent fit so he's going to miss out this week and Toby Roland-Jones comes in for a debut," England captain Joe Root told a press conference on Wednesday ahead of the clash at The Oval.
Roland-Jones's Middlesex colleague Steven Finn, a veteran of 36 Tests, has been called up as stand by in the event of any further injuries to England's pace attack.
The 29-year-old Roland-Jones has twice been included in Test squads for matches at his Lord's home ground but will now make his debut in the five-day game on the other side of London's River Thames at Surrey's headquarters.
Roland-Jones did, however, make his one-day international debut against South Africa at Lord's in May, taking one for 34 in a match England lost by seven wickets.
He played a key role in helping Middlesex win last season's County Championship and his Test call is a reward for several years of consistent performance in the English first-class game.
"Toby has been, in the lead up to the other games, really good in practice and he has obviously had a fine couple of years and it is a very exciting time, as it is for anyone who makes their Test debut," Root said Wednesday.
"I'm really excited for him and I'm sure he's desperate to show everyone what he can do with the red ball for England."
Wood's career has been blighted by injuries, with a succession of ankle problems restricting the 27-year-old to just 10 Tests since his debut against New Zealand in 2015. Root, however, was confident the worst was behind Wood amid fears the bowler may be excessively injury-prone.
"I don't think it's a concern, it is the nature of how he throws himself into his work," the Yorkshireman explained.
"I think he is learning about his body all the time and I can't see him missing out too much longer," Root added.
England will now field at least two debutants in what will be the 100th Test ever staged at The Oval, with Essex batsman Tom Westley previously selected in place of injured number three Gary Ballance.
And they may include a third if Middlesex batsman Dawid Malan, born in London but brought up in South Africa, is included instead of left-arm spinner Liam Dawson.
England's top-order was twice dismissed cheaply at Trent Bridge, including for a mere 133 in their second innings.
That led to Malan's call-up, with the 29-year-old having already made a match-winning 78 for against South Africa during his Twenty20 international debut at Cardiff last month.
England already have a frontline spinner in Moeen Ali, a better batsman than Dawson.
Root said a decision on whether to play Malan or Dawson would wait until Thursday morning.
"I'll have a look at the wicket tomorrow and decide what is happening then," he said.
Several former England captains criticised Root's men for the way they were bowled out twice inside 100 overs at Nottingham.
"I think they are entitled to their opinions," said the 26-year-old star batsman.
"Obviously we were not good enough, there's no point hiding behind it or making excuses, but most importantly it is about the attitude we show this week and that we bounce back from that," he added. AFP
Probable teams and officials for the third Test between England and South Africa:

England (from): Alastair Cook, Keaton Jennings, Tom Westley, Joe Root (capt), Jonny Bairstow (wkt), Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Liam Dawson, Stuart Broad, Toby Roland-Jones, James Anderson, Dawid Malan

He said that private universities setting up in Sri Lanka should be accredited and regulated. He said the government university cannot cope with the demand from students and the solution for this is the creation of private universities.
He said that existing universities too could increase their student strength by having joint venture programs with foreign parties.
Former President, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and Director and CEO Ceylon Breweries, Suresh Shah also endorsed this. Its a crime against the youth to stop opening new universities and depriving them of higher education.

Sri Lanka launches first ever publication on SDGs
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, are a universal call to action to end poverty, to protect the planet and to ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The SDGs, officially known as Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are a set of seventeen aspirational Global Goals with 169 targets and 244 indicators between them to be achieved by April 2030. The SDGs were born at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro in 2012.
The SDGs will guide policy and funding for the next 15years. The 2030 agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity, strengthening peace and requiring partnership for implementation. These five elements of sustainable development are all interconnected. The SDGs focus on new areas such as economic inequality, innovation, climate change, sustainable consumption, peace and justice-among others. The SDGs are universal, inclusive and a bold commitment to people and the planet. As in many other countries, Sri Lanka too, in its development agendas is now focusing on Sustainable Development Goals and how it will improve lives while protecting the planet over the next fifteen years.
The commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) is reflected in having a separate ministry on Sustainable Development, appointing a Parliament Select Committee on SDGs, and establishing cluster committees on SDGs etc. The GOSL anticipates achieving the SDGs by 2030 by working towards the provision of basic needs of the people, progressive alleviation of poverty, elimination of all forms of discrimination and inequalities, and establishing a society based on social justice and human security. The Economic Policy of the Government outlines the vision setting the stage for a sustainable development journey. The Policy aims to develop an economy that will promote the benefits of development among all. An economy that will be friendly to all, beneficial to all. An economy that will pave the way for sustainable development.
The SDGs represent a people-driven transformative agenda built on the foundations of transparency, participation and inclusion. Achieving the SDGs will depend, among others, on the degree of ownership and engagement of people in addressing them. The SDGs matter to all of us as we have a shared responsibility for our future and that of our planet. Without clear goals and measurable targets, as well as comprehensive data sets that allow analysing the situation, including at the local level, we risk leaving the most vulnerable behind and not properly addressing new challenges that impede development and harm our planet.
Being the key agency in the National Statistical System of Sri Lanka, the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) has launched a publication titled Sustainable Development Goals indicators in Sri Lanka: 2017 and the first copy was presented to Thilanga Sumathipala, Deputy Speaker and the Chairman of the Parliament Select Committee yesterday (26). Launched together with the publication is a sub website on SDGs in Sri Lanka, which can be accessed through the DCS website: www.statistics.gov.lk.
This article highlights the key contents of this publication.
National Statistical System
This publication emphasizes the need of institutions other than DCS getting involved with producing data for SDG indicators. In Sri Lanka, What we have is a National Statistical System (NSS). The NSS consists of all statistics-producing entities functioning under the direct responsibility of the government of a country.
The NSS typically consists of the national statistical office (NSO) and any other institutions and administrations that produce official statistics. An effective and efficient NSS that provides regular and reliable data is an important indicator of good policies and is a crucial component of good governance.
The SDG indicators not only require data on areas of enquiry that NSSs have not traditionally produced, they also demand new levels of disaggregation to ensure that we leave No One Behind. What is becoming clear moreover, is that the traditional NSS cannot produce all of the data required alone and new actors such as other Departments and Ministries and private sector organizations must now be engaged with and thought of as part of a wider data ecosystem.
Classification of indicators
In this publication, all 244 SDG indicators are classified according to DCS tier system. To facilitate the implementation of the global indicator framework, all indicators are classified into three tiers on the basis of their level of methodological development and the availability of data at the global level, as Tier 1: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards, and data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant; Tier 2: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but data are not regularly produced by countries and Tier 3: No internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for the indicator, but methodology/standards are being (or will be) developed or tested. The availability of data for indicators at the national level in Sri Lanka, is not necessarily aligned with the global tier classification and therefore, DCS created its own tier classification for implementation.
According to the DCS classification, indicators (disregarding disaggregation levels and global definitions) for which data are already compiled by the DCS through ongoing censuses and surveys and administrative records are classified as:
1. Global SDG indicators/proxy indicators (disregarding disaggregation levels) for which data can be compiled by adding new modules into ongoing censuses and surveys or through new surveys and special studies are classified as,
2. Global SDG indicators/ proxy indicators (disregarding disaggregation levels) for which data are available through other institutions of the NSS are classified as,
3. Global indicators/ proxy indicators (disregarding disaggregation levels) for which data can be compiled by other institutions of the NSS are classified as,
4. SDG indicators corresponding to regional or global levels are classified as,
5. SDG indicators or disaggregation levels, which are not directly relevant to the Sri Lankan context, are classified as,
6. The status of the 244 SDG indicators with respect to DCS classification is presented in the table given:
Indicator framework
All 244 SDG indicators were classified according to the DCS tier system in this publication. A sound indicator framework will turn the SDGs and their targets into a management tool to help countries develop implementation strategies, allocate resources, as well as a report card indicating progress towards sustainable development, and help ensure the accountability of all stakeholders for achieving the 17 goals. As of April 2017, there are 169 targets and 244 SDG indicators between them. There are 244 indicators listed in the revised global list of SDG indicators. Since nine indicators repeat under two or more different targets, the total number of individual indicators in the list is 235. One use of this indicator framework is to show where the goals are being met and where they are not and focus our attention on the need for immediate action. Indicators falling under Codes 1 and 2 have already been identified and those falling under codes 3 and 4 have to be identified in consultation with Departments and Ministries other than DCS. The complete list of all 244 indicators are included in this publication. Part of the indicators currently categorized as 3 or 4 will be moved to categories 5 or 6. In using the indicators for policy making, the definition of the indicators should be correctly known.
Definition of indicators
UN statistics Division has published the definitions of the SDG indicators and the same definitions are used in the publication as well. If the UN definition is different from the local definition, both definitions are given in the publication. In order to monitor the achievements in SDGs, it is essential to produce base line data for at least prioritized SDG indicators.
Baseline data
Production of accessible, timely, and reliable disaggregated data, and building statistical capacity are essential steps in the process of achieving SDGs. Preparing a publication on the availability of data for SDG indicators is an important endeavour to facilitate establishment of baseline data, monitoring the progress, and reporting the achievements of SDG targets.
The United Nations General Assembly has recognized that baseline data for several of the targets remain unavailable, and called for increased support towards strengthening data collection and capacity building for Member States, to develop national and global baselines where they are non-existent. They are committed to addressing this gap in data collection so as to better inform the measurement of progress, particularly for unclear numerical targets.
In Sri Lanka, out of 244 indicators, data are already compiled for 46 indicators through ongoing censuses and surveys conducted by the DCS. The DCS could compile data on 29 indicators by adding new modules into ongoing censuses and surveys. Other institutions of the NSS including various ministries, departments and other institutions need to give leadership in compiling data for some SDG indicators. This publication titled Status of Sustainable Development Goals Indicators in Sri Lanka: 2017 presents baseline data and details on the availability of data on SDG Indicators through statistical activities of the DCS. Baseline data including year, unit, value, source and frequency of updating for all 46 SDG indicators already produced by the DCS are included in this report.
The cross cutting issue ofdata disaggregation
Underpinned by the commitment to Leave No One Behind, the Inter Agency Expert Group on the Sustainable Development Goals has stated that indicators should be disaggregated, where relevant, by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, and geographic location, or other characteristics, in accordance with the Fundamental Principles of Statistics. Data disaggregation is critical because aggregate level data do not show discrepancies at lower levels. DCS will arrange to disaggregate all its statistics into above levels as much as possible to ensure that Sri Lanka will not leave anyone behind it its march towards the 2030 agenda. DCS has launched a website carrying all information discussed here (baseline data, indicator framework etc.) and it can be reached through its website www.statistics.gov.lk.
Website
Through this site, baseline data for 46 indicators can be viewed. By clicking on a goal, the full list of targets and indicators can be viewed. The full indicator framework by goal and target can be viewed in a user friendly manner. This website will serve as a SDG data repository of the country.
Conclusion
The SDGs and their accompanying indicators present both an opportunity and a challenge for Sri Lankas data ecosystem. With increased international and national attention given to the importance of data, data producers of the National Statistical System of the country and users have the opportunity to harness the momentum to make lasting improvements.
Strengthening censuses and surveys, administrative data systems, and exploring the use of new data would all help towards producing more and better indicators.
What is also clear however, is that many of the indicators require cross-governmental and multi-stakeholder participation.

Strike not acceptable - PM
The CPC trade union strike is not acceptable when a number of discussion rounds with unions had ended successfully, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
He said the strike disrupts the dengue prevention programmes, disrupts the economy and the examinations that are scheduled to begin soon. The government has decided to make fuel provision an essential service, the PM said.
Making a ministerial statement in Parliament on the gazette notification making petroleum fuel distribution an essential service,the Prime Minister said the gazette notification on making petroleum distribution an essential service was issued on Tuesday evening.
We decided to make a statement in Parliament on the policy of the government as we always stand to protect parliamentary tradition and democracy, the PM said.
He said that this was not practiced during the previous regime which went even to the extent of not revealing financial matters to Parliament. During the Rajapaksa regime, Parliament had become a mere rubber seal. After President Maithripala Sirisena was elected President democracy was established in the country, the Premier said.
The peoples right to life and expression was guaranteed.However it was observed that this freedom was utilized by several to achieve their petty political ends.
The Premier said there was no issue with the trade unions struggling to win their rights. If someone attempted to lead the country into anarchy the government will have to act responsibly, he said.
Our government never refused to discuss with trade unions.Our ministers had discussed with them on several occasions.I had discussions with them on April 24 and July 13.
He said that they discussed on the matters of Trincomalee and Hambantota Oil Tank farms and the matter of renovation of the Sapugaskanda refinery. He said that government and the trade unions came to an agreement on two matters.He added that the other being matter on Trincomalee oil tank farm the trade unions needed to consult their representatives. He added that there were cases before court on lease agreements on the Trincomalee oil tanks and following the judgments, the matter can be discussed.We have instructed the trade unions to hand over their proposals on the Sapugaskanda refinery and then they could be considered,he said. The Hambantota Oil Tanks belong to the Ports Authority. It was given by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.Then nobody spoke on it, the Premier said. We have directed the trade union requests to the Ministry. I also assured them that the governments actions will not cause any harm to the CPC. It is pathetic that CPC trade unions resumed a trade union action in such a situation.
If the fuel distribution is disrupted the smooth function of all activities come an end including the transport and health, Premier said. It also disrupts the flight arrival and departure and activities at the Port and in turn the strike also affects examinations scheduled to be held in near future.
The Premier also said that by noon yesterday (Wednesday) everything returned to normal. The fuel bowsers are being sent out of the CPC refinery.The aeroplane fuel tanks are being sent to Katunayake too, the Premier said. We hold the democratic principles in esteem.We respect the rule of law. But we dont bow down to those forces that are bent on destabilising the country,he said.

Strike results in huge losses at Petroleum Corporation: Ranatunga

Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, observing that the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) has incurred huge losses and damages over the past few days, said he would furnish a report in that regard to the House shortly.
The minister was speaking at the Parliamentary debate on the Gazette Extraordinary issued by the President declaring the supply and distribution of fuel an essential public service.
We issued the Gazette because we saw how the public have been inconvenienced due to trade union action. The Government is grappling with more issues, such as garbage disposal and the dengue epidemic at the same time. Had the oil crisis continued any longer, the day-to-day activities of the people could have been crippled. We are ready for discussions at any moment, and at the same time we will not hesitate to take swift action if public is inconvenienced, he said.
The Minister, while reiterating that he is against privatization, pointed out that joint investment is necessary to develop certain sectors of the country. Keep aside your political motives when you are dealing with these matters. The petroleum strike could have been called off earlier than this, but some TU leaders are acting as the cats paw of certain rejected politicians and did not allow that to happen, the minister said.
Hambantota oil tanks are not under the CPC, but under the Ports Authority. With joint investment into them we can yield optimal results. I tried to explain this to the TUs. Some political figures with no vote base tried to mess up my work. I do politics with the people. Doing ministerial duties is not like doing betting and gaming. When I was holding the Port and Shipping Ministry I intervened to get that agreement amended for the better, he stated.

Strikers return
Talks with President Successful :
Distribution declared essential:
Workers take over distribution from military
Striking Trade Unions attached to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) temporarily called off their strike after discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena late last evening.
The Unions said the suspension was temporary and would extend until next Tuesday (01).
CPC TU Collective Convener D. J. Rajakaruna told Daily News that they have taken the decision considering the difficulties encountered by the public due to the island wide strike.
Rajakaruna also said the CPC TU is to have another meeting with the President and three more ministers who hold responsibilities regarding this matter.
Rajakaruna also said that President Sirisena told them that there may be a possibility to introduce more amendments to the initial agreements on the Trincomalee oil tank farm and Hambantota refinery, though the government has already introduced amendments to the said agreements on an earlier occasion.
Meanwhile, the Military which took over distribution duties following the declaration of distribution as an Essential Service, have ceased duties at the refineries.
Instead they are only maintaining a presence at the Kollonnawa and the Muthurajawela refineries, Military Spokesman Brigadier Roshan Senevirathne said.
The spokesman said that the strikers had come to an agreement late last evening to resume services.
Earlier, Police Media Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara told the Daily News that 16 workers who were engaged in the strike were arrested by the Welikada Police and were subsequently bailed out, after recording their statements. He said the arrested will be released on police bail after recording statements.
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Trade Unions launched a strike action from Monday midnight (24) based on three demands including the acquisition of the Trincomalee Petroleum tanks complex to the CPC, acquisition of Hambantota Port Tanks Complex to CPC and modernisation of the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery.
Considering the inconvenience faced by the people, the government issued a gazette on Tuesday (25) declaring the Supply or Distribution of Fuel including Petroleum Products and Gas as an essential service.
The government also announced that all CPC staff involved in petroleum distribution must report to work with immediate effect and those who fail to report to work will be considered as having vacated their posts.
By 3.00 pm last evening, 15 fuel bowsers were secured from the Kolonnawa refinery and were sent out islandwide under military protection, together with the cooperation of non-striking Petroleum Corporation drivers.
Military forces entered the Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela fuel storage terminals last morning to ensure the security of the tanks and to guide fuel distribution.
Meanwhile, a tense situation prevailed at the Kolonnawa Petroleum Storage Complex by mid-noon, during an attempt made by Security Forces and Police to remove the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) workers.
The Police closed the Kolonnawa-Dematagoda road and the Police Riot Control Unit was called as the CPC workers extended their demonstration to the main road.
At around the same time, a meeting held between the CPC TU representatives and the Kolonnawa refinery board of directors failed. However, the CPC TU workers said they will carry out essential services unless military personal within the refinery premises were to leave.
Meanwhile, the Police arrested several protesters due to their unruly behaviour. The brawl took place when the police attempted to remove a group of workers who were located near the Kolonnawa refinery premises.
Among the arrested were the CPC TU media spokesman Bandula Saman Kumara and the CPC General Employees Trade Union President Asoka Ranwala.
The Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited (CPSTL) workers announced that they will return to work from yesterday.

Support for fishermen to breed Milk Fish
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera instructed officials to take steps to encourage fishermen to breed Milk Fish (Vekkaya) to use as bait.
The fisher community has brought to the attention of the minister about the increase of price in imported fish bait (Ema) from China.
Most fishermen use some species of squid brought from China. Fishermen said they have to spend US$ 7 per kilo for squid. The Fisheries Ministry had selected 20 beneficiaries under the first stage to be granted Rs. 500,000 each for them to start breeding Milk Fish.
The minister had instructed the Ministry Secretary to submit a proposal on fish breeding to the Budget 2018.
In addition, it was decided to construct a hatchery for the fish breeding centre and start work this year.

'Thugs attacked protesting port workers', JVP complains


The striking workers of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) were attacked by a group of thugs and the Police gave protection to the thugs, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake complained.
The MP also charged that the Welikada OIC had assaulted a trade unionist in police custody: We demand the Government and the IGP to take action against this. An investigation into the Welikada OIC must be conducted after arresting him, he said. 
The MP, participating in the Parliamentary debate today asked Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe to state in the House whether he condones the attack by thugs on striking workers while the Police look on.
Wickremesinghe often talks about the democracy and UK Parliament as if he is the father of democracy. We would like to hear his position with regard to the incidenton Wednesday, he said.
This is the first adverse strike against this Government. The Government used thugs armed with rods and swords to suppress it. If this is the way the Government is dealing with the peoples problems, we vow to prepare the people to face it, he said.

Tough test ahead
At a time when the resilience of the government is being tested with many strikes and protest campaigns and the very existence of the National Unity government is being questioned by sections of both the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), its resolve will be put to the test even further, as the prospect of local government elections emerges.
Local government elections were last held in the country in 2011. Therefore, they are well overdue. Most local government bodies completed their term of office on March 31, 2015, some others in July that year and few others in October. A few local government bodies completed their term of office in 2013.
However the delay in holding polls has partly been due to changes in the boundaries of local government divisions. This was done through a Delimitation Commission which has now completed its findings amidst some controversy.
These changes - as well as changes to the relevant laws- will see a drastic increase in the number of elected representatives to 8825 in 336 Local Government bodies. At present, the total number of local government representatives amount to only about 4,500. Since the new bodies will be elected under new legislation, the Local Government Electoral (Amendment) Act no. 22 of 2012, a quarter of new representatives- over 2200- will be females.
PR system
After months of discussions and negotiations, most political parties have agreed that the system of elections will be a hybrid of the first past the post system based on electoral wards and the proportional representation (PR) system. Previous elections were conducted solely on the PR system. The exact ratio at which the two systems will be merged is awaiting confirmation but a 60:40 system is being mooted.
The combination of the two systems at the Local Government elections will also be a test run because it is envisaged that the next general election will have a similar system, if proposed constitutional reforms to the electoral system are enacted through either an amendment to the Constitution or the drafting of a new Constitution.
What is concerning for the two major parties however are not the details of the election but rather their prospects at the polls and this is a major issue, at least for the SLFP. This is because of the unresolved state of its factional infighting between the mainstream group of the party headed by President Maithripala Sirisena and its Joint Opposition (JO) faction, led by his predecessor, Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The JO has an inherent advantage in that sitting members of Local Government councils were elected in 2011, the heyday of the Rajapaksa Presidency. Being the grassroots level workers of the SLFP, most of them were handpicked for their allegiance to Rajapaksa or his loyalists. The vast majority of them are now with the JO group.
It is also relevant to note that, at the last Local Government elections in 2011, the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), the coalition of which the SLFP was the major partner, won 270 of the 322 Local Government bodies. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) swept the board in the North and some parts of the East, winning 32 local councils. The UNP was only a distant third, winning only nine councils. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) won five councils.
The UPFAs dominance at the time was highlighted by its percentage of the overall vote- over 56 per cent. The UNP, blighted by internal divisions at that time managed just over 30 per cent of the vote. These percentages will no doubt be different at the next election.
The main issue at stake for the SLFP, until a few months ago, was whether it would contest as a single entity or whether the mainstream party and the JO faction would go their separate ways for the election. Now, it appears as if the JO faction wants to test its strength by contesting on its own.
The groundwork for this has already been done. If the JO does contest as a separate entity, it will be as the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). The nominal head of the party is former Minister G.L. Peiris. Former Minister Basil Rajapaksa is known to be the livewire behind the new venture which is recognised party and therefore able to contest elections in its own right.
The JO feels confident that, with about 50 parliamentarians from the SLFP and other smaller parties on board- as opposed to the mainstream partys 45 SLFP parliamentarians- with the burden of incumbency and public dissatisfaction preying on the mainstream party and the Rajapaksa factor thrown in for good measure, it can emerge frontrunners at the poll, at the SLFPs expense.
In fact, the JO is accusing the government of postponing the elections time and again claiming it is running scared of elections. The government however disagrees and now, the mainstream SLFP is also gearing itself at the grassroots level for what is likely to be a bruising campaign.
Local Government polls
In the wake of recent disagreements and public spats between stalwarts of the mainstream SLFP and the UNP, there have also been some suggestions that the SLFP should unite and that the Local Government polls would be a good platform for that. However, it is learnt that these ideas have not found favour at the highest echelons of the party.
Instead, SLFP ministers have been given instructions to buckle down to work in their electorate and expect a poll sooner rather than later. There is a proposal to hold the election this year but a stumbling block is the Ordinary Level examination which is scheduled to be held in December. If this cannot be circumvented, elections would be held early next year.
Certainly the SLFP, with President Sirisena holding the highest office in the land and being a partner in government, wouldnt want to play second fiddle to the JO. That is not only because it would cede control of Local Government bodies to the JO. It is also because an election result in favour of the JO would give the JOs campaign a tremendous boost in the country and create a domino effect which could then spill over to national elections.
The UNP, on the other hand, cannot be content to watch the antics and infighting within the SLFP. While this is a golden opportunity for the party to regroup and resurrect, its campaign will be hampered by what is widely perceived as a lack of control while in government.
It is true that this is partly because it is in coalition with the SLFP and working with a SLFP President, so it cannot do as it pleases. Nevertheless, it is still answerable to the public on the promises it made on issues such as bringing those who were corrupt to justice, ensuring transparent and efficient government and generating economic benefits for the people.
Instead of making good on its promises, the UNP is now faced with the prospect of making excuses for unfulfilled pledges, asking for more time to honour its commitments and even having to answer questions about alleged corruption in its own ranks- hardly what a party which had been languishing in opposition for nearly twenty years would expect in its first two years in office.
Thus the Local Government elections  regardless of whether they are held later this year or early next year- offer the major political parties the tantalising prospect of testing their bench strength vis--vis the electorate. It is also an opportunity for the voter to send these parties a message- a message that they will not be able to ignore.
The lessons they learn from this election could therefore set the tone for the next general election, expected in little over two years-and indeed even a presidential election, if there is one.

Veteran politician  A. R. Mansoor passes away
Veteran politician of the East and former minister and Ambassador to Kuwait A. R. Mansoor passed away at a private nursing home in Colombo on Tuesday. He was 84 years old.
The passing of former UNP Minister is an irreparable loss to the Muslim community of the East in particular and to the country in general, City Planning and Water Supply Minister and leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Rauff Hakeem stated in a message of condolence.
Minister Hakeem added that Mansoor, in his long and unblemished political career spanning two decades, contributed greatly to the socio-economic well-being of the people of the Kalmunai electorate whom he represented. He was admired and respected not only by the Muslims but also by the Sinhalese and Tamils, the minister stated.
Although he entered politics through a different political party to represent his people, he later supported the SLMC, fully endorsing the policies of SLMC's founder-leader M. H. M. Ashraff and worked indomitably and tirelessly for the community, the minister added.
Mansoor was elected to the Kalmunai Electorate in 1977. He served as the District Minister for Mullaithivu. Late Mansooor was appointed as Trade and Shipping Minister. Thereafter, in 1990, he was appointed Trade and Commerce Minister by the then President R. Premadasa.
Mansoor was instrumental in the development of the South Eastern University where he managed to obtain a large sum of money from the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development.
He is also a renowned lawyer and was felicitated by the Kalmunai Bar Association for completing 50 years at the Bar in 2010.
He leaves behind wife Zohara Mansoor, two daughters and son.
His Janasa burial was held at Kalmunai burial grounds.

We not only dropped Dhawan but we also lost a player - Gurusinha
GALLE: Cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha painted a grim picture for his team as they faced a tough opening day of the first Test at the Galle International Stadium where they lost the services of a key player to injury and saw India rattle up an impressive 399 runs for the loss of three wickets.
Its a tough one to lose one of our main players. We are down with ten players against the worlds number one team, said Gurusinha at the end of the day.
Asela Gunaratne injured his left thumb attempting to catch the days highest scorer Shikhar Dhawan when he was on 31 and has been ruled out of the Test. Dhawan seized the chance to score a career best 190 and put India firmly in the saddle.
Its a sad one and Asela will undergo surgery today. Most probably he will miss a minimum of four weeks. We will know in the next 48 hours about the time frame, said Gurusinha.
Asela has fractured his left thumb in three places. As soon as we saw the X-rays we knew it was very serious and we rushed him to Colombo. We received a call around 3:30pm saying that the surgeons had seen him and they will operate him tonight.
Gunaratne came to the match with his left hand heavily plastered and Gurusinha explained: Asela had hurt his webbing sometime back. The same area got hit and ended up with a fracture. He is out for a minimum of six weeks.
Gurusinha said Gunaratnes loss would put more pressure on the rest of the team.
He was our in-form batsman and he is a fighter. We lost Asela as both batsman and bowler. He has been scoring a lot of runs and thats going to put lot of pressure. Dilruwan (Perera) has scored runs against good sides at number seven. Its a responsibility that we will take, said Gurusinha.
Its a good track and its up to the players to come up with their plans. We need to first try and get them out tomorrow. We will probably bat somewhere tomorrow and need to capitalize. This is Galle and after scoring 600 runs you can still lose a Test match. You never know. Our batsmen have to just go out and play good cricket. Lets see what happens on the last two days.
Gurusinha admitted that the bowlers didnt bowl well to plan and that they bowled to Dhawans strength.
We have to be honest that we didnt bowl well. Nuwan Pradeep was the most outstanding I thought. Its a really good batting wicket. I heard Virat saying that it is a good batting wicket. We bowled on both sides of the wicket as well, said Gurusinha.
Shikhar Dhawan just took over the game. His 190 was one reason we find ourselves in this situation. Its a fine effort by him. We know he wasnt in the initial squad and then he came back into the side and showed the selectors what he is capable of. That is the way he plays. Good track for him. We also ended up bowling to his strength and he capitalized on that.
Dhawan was heading for Melbourne not Colombo
Indias batting hero yesterday Shikhar Dhawan would not have been on the plane to Sri Lanka but heading for Melbourne had not Murali Vijay pulled out of the Indian side due to an injured wrist.
My plans were to go to Melbourne and spend time with my family, do training and get fit for the one-day series, said Dhawan after his heady knock yesterday. I was in Hong Kong actually on holiday and from there I flew back to India and joined the team. That was my plan and I think destiny had a different plan for me.
I was happy, of course, to make a comeback to the Test side. Unfortunately, Vijay wasnt fit. I had a good run before this Test series and I just came with the same mindset and the same confidence and did the same process in the nets and got myself ready for this match. The wicket was also good and there wasnt much spin over there. But it still got true bounce and good pace and I feel that I batted well too.
Dhawan expressed his disappointment for missing out on his first double Test hundred.
I would loved to have scored a 200 and 300 was a hundred runs ahead, I hadnt thought about that. But more than that, I got out at the wrong time. It was the last over before tea. But the way I was playing, I was confident that I could clear the mid-off fielder and I was almost hitting a boundary per over. I was in that zone and I backed myself. Unfortunately it didnt go my way.
