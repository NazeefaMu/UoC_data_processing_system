Indonesia-Sri Lanka industrial ties strengthened
Indonesia and Sri Lanka will strengthen cooperation in the industrial sector to improve economic growth of the two countries.
Indonesian President Joko Jokowi Widodo and Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) on ASEAN in Hanoi, Vietnam agreed in this regard.
Indonesian Industry Minister Airlangga Hartarto said the government had offered Complete Package cooperation to Sri Lanka to build railway facilities and infrastructure in the country. So it is not only selling railroad cars, but also offering signaling systems, rails, to depots and stations, he said.
He said Indonesia is one of the biggest players in the manufacturing of railway facilities in Southeast Asia. Indonesias domestic railroad industry products have been able to fulfill domestic, even overseas market orders, especially in developing countries and regional markets.
We continue to spur the national railway industry to dominate the domestic market and increasingly play a role in the supply chain of the railroad industry for the global market, Airlangga said in his official statement in Jakarta on Thursday.
The Industry Ministry has encouraged state-owned railway manufacturer PT INKA to continue to conduct coaching activities for small and medium-scale component industries so that they can produce products of a standard quality and can be used in the railroad industry.
The Minister said the domestic railway supporting industry has been able to produce around 70 per cent of the component requirements, including the railroad frame. We hope that in the next two to three years, the industry is capable of up to 80 per cent of the needs, he said.
The Ministry actively spurred the national railroad industry to continue to innovate technology, especially for export-oriented products. It proactively establishes business cooperation and promotion to increase market access to countries that have a large enough market potential, especially in Asia such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Zambia, Nigeria and Egypt.
The Governments of Indonesia and Sri Lanka also followed up on previous agreements in the trade sector. One of them is the joint efforts of the two countries to export ready-made garments to the European Union.
Based on Making Indonesia 4.0 road map, the textile and textile products (TPT) industry is one of five manufacturing sectors that are prioritised as pioneers in the road map for the application of the fourth industrial revolution. The national textile industry has high competitiveness because its manufacturing structure has been integrated from upstream to downstream and its products are also known to have good quality in the international market.
The Ministry noted that 30 percent of ready-made garments from the national textile industry are to meet the needs of the domestic market, while 70 percent is for export.
The export value of the national textile industry reached $12.58 billion in 2017, up six per cent compared to the previous year. The sector contributes IDR150.43 trillion to GDP in 2017. - NNC

Its not just Serena: how umpire Carlos Ramos has clashed with players
It is said that umpires and referees are doing a good job if fans dont notice they are there. If thats the case then Carlos Ramoss performance during Saturdays controversial US Open final was a failure.
The Portuguese umpire penalised Serena Williams three times during her loss to Naomi Osaka, ultimately awarding the Japanese player a game after Williams called Ramos a thief. Williams accused Ramos of sexism, pointing out that men are rarely called out for such outbursts.
Ramos is a gold-badge umpire, a status conferred on the top officials in tennis. He has vast experience and has umpired a final at all four grand slams, as well as the 2012 Olympic mens final, in which Andy Murray beat Roger Federer.
Ramos also has a reputation as a stickler for the rules. At last years French Open, he drew criticism from the eventual champion, Rafael Nafal after they argued during a fourth-round match. Ramos gave Nadal two warnings for slow play, and the Spaniard felt he was being unfairly treated.
I say it with sadness, but he is an umpire who scrutinises me more and who fixates on me more, Nadal said after the match. He also pressured me about coaching. I have respect for him and all I ask is for that to be reciprocated.
The umpires are here to analyse the match and they are not here to use the stopwatch. There are some who like to take part in the matches more and who like to put more pressure on than others. If you want to see good tennis, you have to let the players breathe a little.
Ramos has also been accused of inconsistencies. At this years Wimbledon quarter-final between Novak Djokovic and Kei Nishikori both players threw their rackets to the ground in frustration. However, only Djokovic was issued a warning and directed a comment at the umpire during the game: Double standards, my friend, double standards, he told Ramos. After the match, Djokovic brought the subject up again with reporters. I thought I didnt harm the grass. I know how I threw the racket. [Nishikori] even threw the racket in the fourth set. [Ramos] said he didnt see it it.
Ramos has also been accused of grandstanding. At the 2016 Olympics, he issued Andy Murray with a code violation when he thought the reigning champion had called him stupid.
I didnt say stupid umpire, I said stupid umpiring. But if you want to be the star of the show, thats fine, said Murray as the two spoke during a break between games.
Williamss sister, Venus, has a history with Ramos too. At the 2016 French Open he accused the elder Williams of receiving coaching during a match, the same offence he penalised Serena for on Saturday. Like her sister, Venus denied she had cheated. Im 36 years old, she said. I play fair.
Although it is impossible to prove whether Ramos was being pedantic or sexist during Saturdays final, it is true that he has never penalised a player a game in such a high-stakes match. For former US Open champion Billie Jean-King there is little doubt where the blame lay.
When a woman is emotional, shes hysterical and shes penalized for it. When a man does the same, hes outspoken and there are no repercussions, she wrote on Twitter. Thank you, Serena Williams, for calling out this double standard. More voices are needed to do the same.

Morkel-inspired Surrey crowned county champions
LONDON, Thursday - Surrey won their first county championship title since Adam Hollioake captained them to success in 2002 as they beat Worcestershire by three wickets on Thursday.
Their victory had been set up by their star performer this season, South African bowling great Morne Morkel, who took 5-24 in Worcestershires second innings on Wednesday -- the fourth time he has taken five wickets in the eight matches he has played in the campaign.
Openers Mark Stoneman and captain Rory Burns gave Surrey a solid start in their chase of 272 and the crown with an opening stand of 111 but Worcestershire -- who are in danger of relegation -- fought hard to take seven wickets.
However, it was appropriately Rikki Clarke -- the only player who bridged the gap between the two title successes -- who at 36 steadied the ship but left it to Morkel to score the winning runs, prompting joyous scenes of jubilation.
The championship rewarded five years of hard labour for Surreys director of cricket Alec Stewart.
Things were struggling. I cant hide behind that, said the former Surrey and England captain.
I said if Im going to come back, let me try and do it my way and if it doesnt work kick me out -- but if it does work then you can pat me on the back, even though it will be the players who have done it.
I said give us a couple of years to get things to where they potentially could be to then move forward and thats what has happened, added the 55-year-old.
For Surrey it was their ninth successive county championship victory, equalling a run they had back in 1999 under Hollioake who guided them to three titles in four years.
Even more cheering for England supporters was that seven of the 11 in the side were home-grown products, whilst Surrey fans will be delighted Morkel has two years remaining on his contract.
The celebrations may well not be over for Burns either as he is touted for a place on the England tour of Sri Lanka having struck four centuries and six half-centuries in passing 1,000 first-class runs for the fifth straight season.
Yorkshire took the last three Lancashire wickets early on the final morning to seal a potentially crucial 95-run victory at Headingley. The result means Yorkshire leapfrog their Roses rivals, who drop into the relegation zone with one game to play.
Resuming on 109-7, needing another 121 to win, Jack Brooks (4-47) uprooted Keshav Maharajs leg stump for 18.
Brooks then bowled Graham Onions, before Ben Coad completed a five-wicket haul to leave the visitors 134 all out.
Centuries from debutant Murali Vijay and Tom Westley guided Essex to an eight-wicket win over Nottinghamshire.
The defending champions chased 282 at Trent Bridge to all but guarantee their Division One status for next season. India opener Vijay added to his first-innings half-century with a ton off 173 balls while Westley reached his first century this season off 193 deliveries.
The pair put on 204 for the second wicket to seal Essexs fifth win of the season, moving them up to third place.

Moves to resolve human - elephant conflict: Minister Fonseka
Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said yesterday, that plans have been set up to resolve the long standing human-elephant conflict within one year.
In the same way that plans were formulated to resolve the 30-year-old terrorist problem within the three years during my tenure as Army Commander, I will formulate plans to resolve the human-elephant conflict within one year in my role as the Wildlife Minister.
The Minister was speaking at a function held to mark the 2nd Anniversary of the Vanadiviya tabloid published by the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (ANCL) and issued with the Dinamina Newspaper at the ANCL premises yesterday.
I have practically observed that most of the facts contained in the informative articles published in the magazine was in relation to wildlife. The supplement has vastly contributed to make aware to the people about wildlife, while creating enthusiasm among the public on the same field. This is a timely need. The general public are not aware about wildlife. as they do not gain any knowledge of wildlife from certain sections of the media, or the so called environmentalists living in Colombo. This magazine would also provide yeoman service to educate and encourage children on wildlife, while creating awareness among them on the importance of protecting wildlife.
Earlier, we used to live with nature, but today, industrial landscapes have distanced us from nature. Today there is a healthy debate on elephants and tuskers. Before I took over the Wildlife Ministry, there was no such debate in the media concerning this subject. This is a good trend. We work expediently to resolve this conflict. People who sling mud at us never make any commitment to solve this issue. There is a malicious campaign that we are trying to deal with certain racketeers to implement the proposed elephant fence project. The project would cost more than Rs. 5 million and we need the assistance of large companies to resolve the problem.
There were 17 elephants and tuskers roaming the Sinharaja forest, while only two of them are presently surviving and we need take measures to protect them. Otherwise, they too would be dead due to human activities. Environmentalists dependent on NGO funds attempt to paint a wrong picture concerning our work and mislead the public. The media should reveal the correct situation of the problem. On average 225 elephants have been killed by farmers, while 85 human deaths have been recorded due to elephants attacks. This has presently turned to be a national issue and we need to get-together and resolve the problem, Minister Fonseka added.
ANCL General Manager Abhaya Amaradasa said that Lake House would always strive to focus on social development my maintaining sustainability in the print media during the past, today and in the future. We lead the print media in terms of educating the public on the Governments development programmes, while other private newspapers implement an agendas of their own. At a time when many media outlets have neglected morals, ethics and statistics in their attempt to win over readers and viewers, we have a duty and mission to inform the public on the Governments development programmes.

Play Usain Bolt in defence, says Spains World Cup-winning coach
Sydney, Friday: World Cup-winning coach Vicente del Bosque has some advice for sprint king Usain Bolts new Australian club -- play him in defence.
The Jamaican superstar has been handed the chance to train with the Central Coast Mariners for an indefinite period in a bid to prove he has what it takes to earn a professional playing contract.
The eight-time Olympic champion made his debut late last month in a 20-minute cameo as a substitute during a friendly, starting in his favoured left wing position.
He nearly scored but tired quickly and admitted he was not match-fit, with Australian pundits saying he had plenty of work ahead to make the grade.
Del Bosque, whose eight-year reign as Spain coach ended after their last-16 exit at Euro 2016, said it was possible Bolt could fulfil his dream of becoming a footballer, despite being 32.
For a team that counter-attacks hard and transitions quickly into open space, sure (he would fit in). It would be possible, of course, de Bosque, who guided Spain to the 2010 World Cup title, told the Olympic Channel.
But he suggested the 100m world record holder would be better in defence than up front.
With space, he could be a very good footballer, said del Bosque, who also steered Real Madrid to Champions League success.
He could be a full-back that covers a lot of space, but it depends, because its not just about covering 100, or 60 or 70 metres of the pitch.
Its about doing it many times over and that requires stamina which I dont know whether he has or not -- although Im sure he has prepared.
Without a doubt as a full-back, with his back towards the crowd and the touchline, thats where he would be most useful.
Bolt, who retired from athletics last year, has previously tried out with clubs in Germany, South Africa and Norway, to no avail. He has acknowledged the pace and rhythm of football is completely different to the athletics track and said it will take time to adjust.
Del Bosque believes that if Bolt makes it as a footballer, it will rank alongside his greatest achievements. To start playing professional football at the age of 32 isnt normal, he said.
But he has won a lot during his 32 years of life and, he has earned the right to say: Hey, I want to be a footballer. -AFP

Politicians cannot do all - Duminda
Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said the public must understand that politicians are not omnipotent and they do not have to lead every aspect from attending a funeral to laying foundation for a culvert or commissioning a new bridge.
The Minister was addressing farmer organisations representatives in Mahawilachchiya recently.
People do not understand that the officials from grassroots level to the top are planning, designing and implementing development work by using government funds in consultation with the parliamentarians, he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe takes steps to develop commercial sector and President Maithripala Sirisena help develop the agricultural sector to upgrade the economy, he said.
Ministers in England and Singapore do not go from village to village to supervise construction or to participate in every ceremonial openings, the Minister said.
He said the ministers should be present where plans are executed and decisions are made. They must correct discrepancies, shortcomings, and lapses at the top level. But now we are expected to save the government, the party and ourselves, he said.
He said that under the directions of the President steps have been taken to remove sediment in water sources and renovate canals and tanks. He said 85,000 families in the Anuradhapura district including Mahawilachchiya are receiving drought relief.

President calls for quality public transport service
President Maithripala Sirisena said the public transportation service must be made convenient for the public.
The President was participating in a discussion at the Presidents Office on maintaining a regular public transportation service and uplifting its quality.
During the discussion, progress of the Sahasara Niyamu Project introduced in 2016 was reviewed to introduce a quality transportation service.
President Sirisena brought the attention of the officers towards the ways to attract the public towards the public transportation system by reducing road congestion, ensuring their safety, and making it public-friendly service.
Transportation causes severe setbacks in economy. Crowded buses, lack of decent service, delays and other issues worsen the situation. Employers in the field will not receive professional dignity because of various public-unfriendly issues..
Sixty five per cent of the commuters used public transportation in 2008. Now the percentage has reduced to 45 per cent.

Arrest of Military officers:
PRESIDENT CHIDES AG, CID
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday revealed that he had severely admonished officials of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the Attorney General for constantly taking military officers into custody, remanding them for a short period and then releasing them, even though there had been no prosecutions so far.
Addressing newspaper editors and heads of media institutions at Presidents House yesterday, President Sirisena said that since investigations began in 2015, not a single case had been filed against military suspects arrested in connection with the Lasantha Wickrematunge assassination case, the Prageeth Ekneligoda abduction case, the Keith Noyahr abduction and assault case and the abduction of 11 Tamil youth.
I received a copy of the IGPs latest progress report on these investigations into the attacks on journalists and so on, and I found that not a single prosecution had been filed so far since 2015, he told editors at the breakfast meeting. The former second in command of the Army was arrested and remanded for five months, but no case was filed, the President added, referring to the former Director of the Directorate of Military Intelligence, Amal Karunasekera.
For weeks, there are reports about the Chief of Defence Staff facing allegations of harbouring a person involved in abducting 11 children, the President said. The CID says they have all been taken into custody, but they have also been released on bail and there are no indictments served on them so far. And even though the suspects were in fact released on bail, the accusation against the Chief of Defence Staff is that he has prevented the arrest of a suspect, President Sirisena added.
The President was referring to Admiral Ravindra Wijeguneratne whose arrest was said to be imminent after the CID told a Magistrate that he had been harbouring a suspect wanted in connection with the abduction and suspected murder of 11 Tamil youth in 2008-09.
President Sirisena told reporters that he had summoned the Attorney General, IGP and CID top brass for a meeting two days ago, and pitched into them about the failure to file cases against those being accused of these crimes. I told them, dont arrest and detain these people if you cant file cases against them, he said.
The way things are being reported, the perception in the country is that the Chief of Defence staff killed these 11 children, the President charged.
President Sirisena added that he had told the CID and the AG that they were arresting and remanding senior military officials for months and then releasing them, giving rise to an accusation against the Government that it was on a witch-hunt of war heroes.
Meanwhile, referring to the emergency Cabinet meeting called on Thursday (13), and reports that there had been major clashes at the meeting, President Sirisena quipped that Cabinet meetings were highly democratic now.
There is a great atmosphere of debate and discussion at Cabinet meetings now. There are strong exchanges of views, fierce debates and frank discussions. In no Government, I have been a part of have Cabinet meetings been like this, he said.

Resolving post-war issues
Presidents UNGA proposals to be presented at UNHRC in March 2019
Signalling that Sri Lanka may take a step back on commitments made in the 2015 UNHRC resolution in Geneva, President Maithripala Sirisena told media heads yesterday that he would submit a comprehensive set of fresh proposals aimed at resolving post-war issues, including the allegations of human rights violations against the Sri Lankan military and the demands for the release of LTTE suspects and convicts currently in custody by their families, to the UN General Assembly on September 25.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist, President Sirisena also announced that this proposal would be submitted in writing to the UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres and new UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet.
At the UNGA, it will be a request he will be making on behalf of Sri Lanka he said.
We are also hoping to present these proposals as a resolution to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2019, the President added.
There will be criticisms against these proposals from various quarters, but I have to think about the future of the country, he explained. President Sirisena said that now that Sri Lanka had repaired relations with the UN and the international community, it was time for the conditions of the UNHRC resolution on the country to be relaxed. This is what is necessary to ensure the independence, national security and dignity of our country, he said.

Negative clauses in Singapore-SL FTA will be scrapped: President
President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday that the committee appointed to study the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement was still inviting broad consultations of the text, and pledged to scrap sections of the agreement if the committee finds they would adversely impact local trade and industries. I am willing to take responsibility for it, President Sirisena told editors at a breakfast meeting yesterday.
If the Committee finds that there are grave problems with the FTA, action will be taken accordingly, he added

Protecting Democracy
Democracy has come a long way since it was first practised in ancient Greece. In fact, the very word is derived from the Greek Demokratia (demos=people and Kratia=rule), which essentially means peoples rule. In ancient Greece, it was possible for everyone to be in a governing council (direct democracy), but this is not possible with todays populations. Hence, we have representative democracy, where we send representatives on our behalf to a parliament or other governing structure.
Democracy is a concept worthy of celebration. The world will be doing just that today, the International Day of Democracy under the 2018 theme 'Democracy under Strain: Solutions for a Changing World'. The day is an opportunity to look for ways to invigorate democracy and seek answers to the systemic challenges it faces. This includes tackling economic and political inequalities, making democracies more inclusive by bringing the young and marginalized into the political system, and making democracies more innovative and responsive to emerging challenges such as migration and climate change.
With this year marking the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Day of Democracy is also an opportunity to highlight the values of freedom and respect for human rights as essential elements of democracy. Democracy, in turn, provides the natural environment for the protection and effective realization of human rights.
The International Day of Democracy provides an opportunity to review the state of democracy in the world. Democracy is as much a process as a goal, and only with the full participation of and support by the international community, national governing bodies, civil society and individuals, can the ideal of democracy be made into a reality to be enjoyed by everyone, everywhere. What are the essential features of a democracy that sets it apart from a dictatorship The values of freedom, respect for human rights and the principle of holding periodic and genuine elections by universal suffrage are essential elements of a functioning democracy.
Sri Lanka is one of the few countries in the region, along with India, where democracy has survived and thrived in the post-independence era despite some tumultuous times. There have been multiple threats to democracy in Sri Lanka including the failed 1962 coup, the JVP-led insurgencies in 1971 and 1988-89 and LTTE terrorism. But each time, the democratic framework not only emerged intact, but also became stronger.
Democracy is not only about elections  many dictatorships around the world hold regular sham elections  but it is a combination of several factors including freedom of expression, freedom of movement, independence of judiciary, equality of all individuals, human rights and media freedom. Sometimes, democracy can be threatened even by duly elected Governments  this was witnessed in Sri Lanka from 2005-2014 when democratic institutions were attacked almost on a daily basis. Political opponents of the regime were jailed or made to disappear courtesy of the white vans, journalists were killed and attacked, media freedom was stifled, Presidential powers were strengthened and even the Chief Justice was impeached overnight. The nation heaved a collective sigh of relief when the Good Governance Government came to power in 2015, ending this sustained attack on Democracy. To its eternal credit, this Government has restored democracy in all its forms and manifestations and people are breathing freely once again.
However, worldwide, democracy is still under severe strain. Gains have certainly been made  one example is Pakistan, where a civilian Government is again in power. But there still are many other dark spots from Iraq to Afghanistan where democratic institutions and functions are at great risk. In some countries, extremist politicians dabble in racism, xenophobia and bigotry that directly attack democratic norms. Many countries also face the risk of transnational terrorism, which tears democratic institutions apart. Extremist and autocratic tendencies have crept into many democracies. Dictatorships that appear to be democratic on the surface gradually strip off the fabric of democracy.
Democratic countries must always be on guard against any attempts to subvert the process and vales of democracy from within or outside. We generally tend to disregard the value of democracy until the day we lose it. Having very nearly lost it, Sri Lankans know the value of democracy. But for democracy to work, the peoples representatives must work for and on our behalf. As highlighted in this space yesterday, it is useless to elect peoples representatives who do not raise their voice on behalf of the public.
Democracy is also about information, transparency, accountability and empowerment. We need to know what our peoples representatives are doing with public funds  hence the importance of instruments such as Right to Information (RTI) laws. We need to know what they are doing and they should be held accountable at all times. Above all, democracy should empower us as a people, a nation to march ahead with dignity and unity.

In order to take basketball to the next level in the country Royal College and Gateway College have joined hands to conduct an annual encounter which is a popular concept in Sri Lanka to make basketball a spectator sport.
The annual encounter will be played for the Alles-Gunasekara Cup named after two key personalities connected to the two schools. Late R I T Alles, commenced his journey as a teacher of Royal College where he served for over 10 years. Alles did yeoman service to the country as the founder Principal of D S Senanayake College and later as the State Secretary of Education. Remembered by many as one of the finest educators, the country has produced, Alles is also the founder of Gateway College.
Late E Christie Gunasekara, a Royalist himself was a long standing vice principal of Royal College and former president of the Sri Lanka Schools Basketball Association who is respected for his unrelenting commitment to uplift discipline and standards of Royal College during his day
Both schools are keen to make this a unique encounter by introducing a new culture with rich traditions that would include activities for spectator engagement and a joint follow-up social welfare program. Due attention will be paid to upcoming talent by including an under 15 match before the main under 19 encounter.
The girls invitation under 19 game between Gateway College and Ladies College will add colour and diversity to the encounter.
The Royal team captained by Heshan Meethalawa has been playing together from their under 15 days. Several players in the team were in the under 20 National School winning team while some of the team members played for the under 18 National 3x3 Youth Basketball Team.
The Gateway team is spearheaded by Aaron Fonseka who represented Sri Lanka in the South Asian Basketball Championship. He also captain of the Sri Lankan team at the under 18 3x3 FIBA Asia Cup.
The relatively young Gateway team reached the under 17 A Division finals for two years in a row and has to-date won the most number of 3x3 Basketball Championships held during 2018.
Royalists emerged victorious in the inaugural encounter by 46-43 while Gateway College won the under 15 title.
Monash University of Australia and Malaysia will be the Principal sponsor of the event. Adidas will feature this year as the sportswear sponsor.

Salvation Army celebrates 135 years
The Salvation Army Sri Lanka (SASL) celebrated its 135 years of service, at Galadari Hotel, Colombo, recently.
The celebration was marked by the launch of the Public Annual Report 2017 for Sri Lanka.
The release was significant in view of the 14 decades of service by the organisation, committed to transforming the lives of Sri Lankans who live in extreme poverty and are victims of injustice and discrimination.
The report titled Answering the Call, depicts the tale of how the Salvation Army journeyed and developed in the country. The aim of the Salvation Army is to ensure that all communities live together in harmony, enjoying a better and brighter future.
The International Salvation Army was founded in 1865 by the then Methodist Minister William Booth, having experienced the despicable plight of slum dwellers in East London.
The Organisation now serves in about 130 countries. The projects in Sri Lanka include the provision of large-scale safe water wells. More than 15,000 people now enjoy safe water facilities with community wells built by the Salvation Army. The SASL has built about seven wells for the rural poor.
The projects also include nutrition programmes in eight districts; long-standing residential care for mothers and babies, children, and elders as well as island-wide hostel accommodation services for young employed and differently- abled people.
The Army Medical Services also conducted mobile medical clinics, assisted by local medical practitioners and health officers.

Alastair Cook has his name written on record books all around the cricketing world. Hes known to be a disciplined batsman who scored freely all around the globe and became Englands best. Few can match his stroke play and will to succeed as he remained in form for most of his career.
Englands record run scorer and former captain retired from international cricket after the series against India. We bid farewell to another modern legend of the game who has done great service to England, leagues around the world and to the world of cricket all over.
Many facts keep floating around the internet regarding sportsmen. There's only a few that remains little-known about these stars. Lets take a look at six little-known facts about Alastair Cook you probably werent aware of.
#6 FAMOUS AT A VERY YOUNG AGE
Raised in a family that loves music, Cook was a singer in his younger days. He was a chorister who spent five years at St. Paul's Cathedral school singing treble in the cathedral choir. This led him to become famous at a very young age, and he even got a chance to perform for the Queen! His voice is featured on many CDs which can be purchased even today.
#5 A MUSICIAN AT HEART
It isnt just signing that Cook excelled at. Cook is also good at playing a few instruments. Hes learned to play the piano and the saxophone at a young age. At age eight, he was granted a scholarship at Bedford School and was learning the clarinet at the time.
#4 THE HIGH ACHIEVER
It isnt just international cricket where hes broken many records. Hes done so at all levels of the game and is recognized as a match-winner all over. Hed even broken all batting records at his school Bedford and ended up making 19 centuries for the school team in total.
#3 HE SUFFERS FROM OPHIDIOPHOBIA
Alastair Cook isnt afraid of any bowler in the world. Hes faced the fastest in the form of Brett Lee, Shoaib Akhtar and Shaun Tait, and the most skillful in the form of Muttiah Muralitharan, Shane Warne, and Graeme Swan. However, he is afraid of snakes to such an extent that hes confessed to having dreams of him getting eaten by them!

The Snake ball - mesmerizing lethal beauty
Cricket has a peculiar way of mesmerizing you from time to time. If you have been watching cricket for quite some time like I have, I can safely assume that you too have witnessed some of the most surprising things happen during a match that intrigued you to the core. This little piece is about one such interesting thing I have observed in the realm of seam and swing bowling - "The Snake ball"
A snake ball is not something you will find in the hardcore glossary of cricket terms but certainly will in the dictionary of cricketers and cricket fans. A snake ball is used to describe a delivery bowled generally by a pacer which the ball first moves in, cuts back and then moves away. As a batsman, all you can think about is thank your lucky stars that the ball didn't rattle the stumps.
Here are two examples to discuss with you the magical snake ball but first, we should discuss the distinction between the art of swing bowling and seam bowling.
A swing bowler tries to deceive the batsman by getting sideways movement through the air. A swing bowler tries to pitch the ball up, landing the ball closer to the batsman as it allows the ball more time in the air for swing to occur which forces batsman to play straight-bat shots like drives, which might result in a leading edge behind the stumps if the ball is moving away and LBW if moving in. It can be assisted by the weather conditions at the ground if the wind is flowing perpendicular to the pitch.
On the other hand, a seam bowler tries to get sideways movement off the pitch by pitching the ball right on the seam so that it may deviate either way if it hits a crack on the pitch. A seam bowler generally tries to pitch the ball a little shorter off the length in order to land the ball harder onto the pitch to get more deviation of the ball. It mostly depends on the pitch conditions, given how hard the pitch is and if cracks are present or not. However, it doesn't depend entirely on the pitch conditions. Wind can play a tricky part as well because if the wind is flowing parallel to the pitch. it might very well vary the bounce of the ball.
The very skilled Australian pacer James Pattinson awe-struck the cricketing fraternity with this beautiful snake ball. The seam position couldn't be better as the ball landed right on the seam at an impressive speed of 143.9 kph or 89.4 mph, moved in towards the batsman, cut back, and moved away later.
Bowled at a perfect length combined with good pace, the ball was intentionally landed onto the cracks on the pitch to deceive the batsman successfully. The batsman, Cheteshwar Pujara was completely beaten with the sharp in-swing. The wicketkeeper Matthew Wade caught the ball well after it moved away. This was a terrific utilization of the pitch by the talented seam bowler.
MOVING ON
Shoaib Akhtar, the Pakistani speedster, impressed the world of cricket with his incredible pace, precise length and swing from his debut to the last match. One of the most feared bowlers to ever grace the game, Shoaib bowled an absolute beauty in a Test match against India to get rid of VVS Laxman.
The ball was bowled at a magnificent pace of 142.1 kph or 92.6mph and wasn't pitched at all. Akhtar brilliantly utilized his pace and reverse swing abilities to move the ball away after bowling at an inward angle.
Bowling at such a pace and garnishing it with outward movement very close to the batsman was phenomenal. This is what a dangerous piece of swing bowling can do. Leave one of the finest batsmen in the world like VVS Laxman in disbelief.

Top 10 prolific fast bowlers in Test history
During the final days play in the fifth Test between England and India at the Oval, seam spearhead James Anderson embellished his name in the record books. The 36-year old overtook Glenn McGraths tally of 563 wickets to become the most prolific fast bowler in the history of Test cricket.
Going into the fifth Test, Anderson had needed just five wickets to procure the all-time record from the Australian legend. After picking two wickets in the first innings, he inched closer by removing Shikhar Dhawan and Cheteshwar Pujara during the penultimate day.
When he castled Mohammed Shami in the last session of the match, the modern-day swing icon not only sealed Englands 118-run victory but also ascended to the summit of pace bowling in Test history.
With 564 wickets from 143 Tests, Anderson is now perched on top of the list of all-time fast bowlers in the purest format of the game. When the historical list is expanded to include spinners as well, only the illustrious troika of Muttiah Muralitharan (800 wickets), Shane Warne (708 wickets) and Anil Kumble (619 wickets) stand above the England seamer.
Aside from Anderson and McGrath, West Indies stalwart Courtney Walsh (he held the all-time record at the time of his retirement) is the only other fast bowler to possess more than 500 Test wickets. Outside the top three, theres a significant difference in the wickets tally as decorated Indian all-rounder Kapil Dev occupies the fourth spot with 434 wickets. Close on his heels is Stuart Broad. At the moment, the 32-year old England seamer requires only two more wickets to leapfrog him.
From just 86 Tests, Sir Richard Hadlee managed to amass a whopping 431 wickets. South African greats Dale Steyn and Shaun Pollock have collected 421 scalps each. The active 35-year old, who is on the cusp of snatching the Proteas crown, has taken an identical number of wickets from 20 lesser matches when compared to his erstwhile teammate.
While Pakistani wizard Wasim Akram picked 414 wickets from 104 Tests, the venerated Sir Curtly Ambrose rounds off the top ten with 405 scalps. The fact that only ten fast bowlers have gone past the 400-wicket mark reiterates the value of endurance.
Among the ten most prolific fast bowlers in Test history, Ambrose and Steyn possess the best average (20.99) and strike-rate (42) respectively.
TOP 10 PROLIFIC FAST BOWLERS IN TEST HISTORY

GENERAL DENIS - The Epitome of Leadership:
Valuable contribution to biographical literature
The Association of Retired Flag Rank Officers is a distinguished Association of Senior Officers, composed broadly of Generals, Admirals and Air Marshals and sub categories among these high ranks, now officially in retirement from the services. The association is engaged in a broad range of activities pertaining to the areas of international relations, defence policy, institutional development and comparative studies and historical research relating to the three services. In this context they have brought out a biography of Deshamanya General Denis Perera, former Commander of the Sri Lanka Army with the title GENERAL DENIS The Epitome of Leadership.
The General, a pioneering and seminal contributor to the growth, expansion and the inculcation and enforcement of high standards in all matters connected with the development of the Army was possessed of a commanding personality allied to a sense of personal modesty. Therefore, when about to retire it was suggested that he should write his memoirs, he replied politely that I will leave to others. Those others in the form of The Association of Retired Flag Rank Officers have now acted on the Generals comment which at the time it was made, he no doubt felt would not bear fruit. Sadly, he is not with us to appreciate the commendable effort that has gone into bringing out this publication.
The book is important in relation to many dimensions. The General was among the first batch of officer cadets who were sent to the Sandhurst Military Training Establishment in Britain at the dawn of Ceylons Independence.
From that point onwards, Denis Pereras career and the evolution and growth of the national army were coterminous. In this unfolding scenario, the young officer gradually acquiring more seniority and entrusted with more responsibility showed his qualities of hard work, consistency, bold initiative and implementation capacity. Perhaps, there was an element of destiny in all this. Denis happened to enlist as an officer cadet on October 10, 1949, the day the Army was formed which also happened to be his birthday!
The book contains well researched facts, figures and dates. It has in a commendable manner gathered up important details that would have been scattered in files, documents, regimental records, the Training Center at Diyathalawa and many other places. These have been woven into the narrative in an easy and readable style enriched further with interesting personal recollections of many persons. As one reads, one feels the difficulty of separating the person from the institution, the institution that he was doing so much to build.
The book relates the central role he played in upgrading the Training Center at Diyatalawa to the status of a well-constituted and well-resourced academy. In striking fashion, the narrative records the growing seniority, positions, responsibilities and achievements of the subject of this biography.
The Major Army Cantonment at Panagoda; the Combat Training School at Ampara; The setting up strategically of cantonments in various planned locations; the raising of new Regiments, many of them of great note and importance later, such as the Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment, The Rajarata Rifles, later to become the Gajaba Regiment; the Commando Unit, the Womens Corps and others, were all the products of his vision, energy and initiative. The book also relates the negotiations conducted with Sir John Kotelawala and success that was had in persuading Sir John to gift his Kandawala Estate in Ratmalana to set up the Defence Acadamy for the higher education and training of officers of all three services.
Quite deservedly when the academy was elevated to the status of University, General Denis Perera became its Chancellor.
There were many other achievements to his credit as a military personality. They are all contained in the book. But one that needs special mention is the Generals role in coordinating the compilation of the important publication entitled the History of the Army Fifty years on.
The biography also knits together many interesting stories and anecdotes relating to the training at Sandhurst, travel on the continent, the resourcefulness and problem solving skills that were displayed when required, camaraderie among colleagues and idiosyncrasies of trainers among other matters.
The book also brings out charming vignettes of family life encompassing different generations and families. It contains reminiscences of children, grandchildren, in-laws, friends, colleagues and subordinates. All reflections display both affection and respect. The positive impact on others lives is clear. The biography is therefore not a mere historical record or a chronicle of events and personalities. It is also a warm and living human document.
Finally, the book unfolds the Generals post retirement activities and the responsibilities he undertook as High Commissioner to Australia with concurrent accreditation to many other countries, including Papua New Guinea and Fiji, as well as the important role he played in the private sector of Sri Lanka, as Chairman or a member of the Board of Directors of many companies.
The Generals interests and accomplishments did not stop there. He was a member or high office holder of many important associations, including being President of the Association of Retired Flag Rank Officers.
At the end of the book, there is the reproduction of a moving eulogy delivered by Brigadier A P R David at the memorial service for the late General at All Saints Church Borella on October 14, 2013. In death as in life, General Denis Perera was loved and respected.
This book then, is a valuable contribution to the biographical literature of the country. It is all the more valuable in that there is a comparative dearth of writings on the institutions and personalities relating to the armed services. The information, episodes and material in the book however, transcends the institutions that form its background and have many elements of universal application and relevance.
There is very little knowledge in the civilian sectors about matters relating to the intense training, discipline and standards that are promoted and inculcated in service men and woman.
The knowledge and insights provided in this book are important, relevant and valuable to all professional groups and persons who themselves have to follow conventions and codes of discipline, establish focus, provide leadership and aim at achievement.
The Association of Retired Flag Rank Officers have therefore provided a valuable public service in bringing out this book. It is plain that much hard work, research, discussion and skilled drafting had gone in to the production of this biography which is enhanced with well selected pictures and photographs. The writers and editors while paying deserved homage to a great military personality and gentleman have also skilfully made the publication relevant to the wider circle of professionals in this country.
The impact made is therefore greater than the life and times of a single person, important as he was.

## Title: Venezuela: The other side of the story

Venezuela: The other side of the story
Venezuela is in the news constantly. There is a well orchestrated campaign by the Western media that the country is facing a humanitarian crisis and is on the verge of falling apart. Voices are also heard of the need for outside interference. All options including armed aggression are proposed openly, ostensibly under the pretext that the situation in Venezuela threatens the security of the United States.
Columbia has become a willing collaborator of the United States. It has amassed armed detachments along the Venezuelan border. Brazil is also vying to join Venezuela in a military confrontation. On the other hand, Venezuela has defense cooperation with Russia and China who are likely to come to its assistance in case of war. An all-out media war exists with fake news proliferating at lightning speed.
The Third World media simply reproduces the news and views of the west and the gullible public believes in everything they say. Hence, we produce below without comment another side of the story as told by a UN rapporteur.
The crisis in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is an economic crisis, which cannot be compared with the humanitarian crises in Gaza, Yemen, Libya, the Syrian Arab Republic, Iraq, Haiti, Mali, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Somalia, or Myanmar, among others. It is significant that when, in 2017, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela requested medical aid from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the plea was rejected, because it is still a high-income country  and as such is not eligible, says Professor de Zayas, the UN rapporteur who visited Venezuela.
According to him among the multiple factors affecting the crisis are;
1) the century-old dependence on the sale of petroleum and the devastating effect of the sharp fall of oil prices,
2) the cumulative effect of 19 years of economic war conducted against the socialist regime, comparable to the measures adopted 1970-73 against the government of Salvador Allende in Chile and in the 1980s against the government of Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua,
3) the financial blockade, comparable to that suffered by Cuba since 1960, and
4) the effects of the economic sanctions imposed since 2015, which have immensely aggravated the scarcity of foods and medicines, caused serious delays in distribution, and triggered the phenomenon of mass emigration to neighbouring countries.
The effects of sanctions imposed by Presidents Obama and Trump and unilateral measures by Canada and the European Union have directly and indirectly aggravated the shortages in medicines such as insulin and anti-retroviral drugs.
To the extent that economic sanctions have caused delays in distribution and thus contributed to many deaths, sanctions contravene the human rights obligations of the countries imposing them. Moreover, sanctions can amount to crimes against humanity under Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. An investigation by that Court would be appropriate, but the geopolitical submissiveness of the Court may prevent this.
He observes that In order to discredit selected governments, failures in the field of human rights are maximized so as to make violent overthrow more palatable. Human rights are being weaponized against rivals. Of special interest is his conclusion that There is not only a horizontal juridical world order governed by the Charter of the United Nations and principles of sovereign equality, but also a vertical world order reflecting the hierarchy of a geopolitical system that links dominant States with the rest of the world according to military and economic power. It is the latter, geopolitical system that generates geopolitical crimes, hitherto in total impunity. Economic sanctions kill.
The rapporteur concludes that The solution to the Venezuelan crisis lies in good faith negotiations between the Government and the Opposition, an end to the economic war, and the lifting of sanctions.
Less food for more people
While technology has improved food production to adequate levels and even surpluses are generated more people in the world face food insecurity and are suffering from malnutrition. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) the number of undernourished persons in the world increased by 821 million in 2017. That means one in every ninth is undernourished.
Three main reasons are attributed to this situation. They are intensification of conflicts, economic downturn and climate change. Hundreds are caught in internal and inter-State conflicts and an ever-increasing number of refugees cross borders in order to save their lives. In this attempt they undergo numerous difficulties including hunger and are at the mercy of charitable organisations. Economic downturn also reduces the prospects of food security, especially access to food for the poor and marginalized sections of the population. Climate change including El Nino phenomena are causing floods, drought, melting of the polar ice-caps and warming of land and water.
The very existence of the human species is under threat. Though collective efforts are being taken to mitigate climate change the United States has withdrawn from the world Climate Deal and is continuing disastrous environmental policies for short-term benefits. Looking at another angle poverty, inequality and marginalization could be termed the causes of food insecurity and undernourishment.
The recent increase in the numbers of the undernourished casts doubts about the possibility of attaining the SDG of zero hunger by 2030.
Today there are 151 million children less than five years of age who are afflicted with stunting.
It is 22 percent of all children of that age category. Another 51 million suffer from wasting. Among adults over 672 million are found to be obese or overweight. That means obesity affects one in every eight persons on our planet.

Catastrophic Florence batters Carolinas
US: Hurricane Florence battered the Carolinas early yesterday with howling winds, life-threatening storm surges and torrential rains as it edged closer to the coast in what officials warned is a once in a lifetime event.
Reports said coastal streets in North Carolina were flooded and winds bent trees to the ground as the storm, which has been downgraded to Category 1 and is weakened and slower moving than in recent days, prepared to make landfall at some point on Friday.
More than 150,000 customers in North Carolina were reported to be without power as the outer band of the storm approached.
Footage from US TV outlets showed raging waters hitting piers and jettys and rushing across coastal roads in seaside communities.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds along the North Carolina coast.
This storm will bring destruction, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said. Catastrophic effects will be felt. Federal emergency management officials warned that Florence -- while weakening slightly -- remains a very dangerous storm capable of wreaking havoc along a wide swathe of the coast.
Warning of looming storm surges of nine to 12 feet (2.7-3.6 meters), he urged residents to take the storm seriously no matter the category, saying this is all about the water anyway. Florence was downgraded to a Category 2 storm overnight on the five-level Saffir-Simpson wind scale but it is still packing hurricane-force winds of 100 miles (155 kilometers) per hour, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
Winds were already picking up along the coastline early Thursday and some minor flooding was reported on the Outer Banks, barrier islands off the coast of North Carolina, and in some seaside coastal towns.
Myrtle Beach, a South Carolina beach resort, was virtually deserted with empty streets, boarded up storefronts and very little traffic.
And in Wilmington, North Carolina, a steady rain began to fall as gusts of winds intensified, causing trees to sway and stoplights to flicker. This rainfall will produce catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding, the NHC said. A tornado watch was also in effect for parts of North Carolina. About 1.7 million people in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia are under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders and millions of others live in areas likely to be affected by what officials called a once in a lifetime storm.
South Carolina ordered the mandatory evacuation of one million coastal residents while North Carolina announced an evacuation of the Outer Banks, a popular tourist destination.
In Virginia, 245,000 coastal residents were told to flee.
A state of emergency has been declared in five coastal states -- North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland and Virginia -- as well as the US capital Washington.
Duke Energy, a power company in the Carolinas, estimated that one million to three million customers could lose electricity because of the storm and that it could take weeks to restore. - AFP

Lanka commences Asia Cup campaign against Bangladesh
All eyes on Slinga Malinga
DUBAI, Friday  Past feats like having won the 50-over Asia Cup on five occasions which puts Sri Lanka on par with India wont come into play when the 14th edition gets under way at the Dubai Sports Complex with Sri Lanka taking on Bangladesh in the curtain-raiser of the six-nation tournament.
The format is such that there is no room for a comeback once you start the tournament on the back foot. With only the top two teams out of three in a group qualifying for the next stage of the competition the Super Four, it is imperative that any team starts with a win.
In that aspect both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will be determined to grab the first points before they take on newcomers to Test cricket, but no strangers to the one-day format Afghanistan.
Sri Lankas chances have been boosted by the return of super star fast bowler Lasith Malinga to international cricket after nearly a year.
For the 35-year-old Slinga this will be a make or break tournament for him. Although not quite at his quickest anymore Malinga has the full backing of his head coach cum national selector Chandika Hathurusingha.
I believe that Malinga fits into our equation for this tournament, said Hathurusingha. He is one of the best death bowlers in the world. In the last few matches, he has performed well and his fitness is up to the mark.
Malinga proved that he was keen to get back into the national side by participating in the recently concluded domestic T20 league where although he was not so much amongst the wickets he was economical and proved his fitness. How well he bowls his ten overs in the fifty-over format will decide Sri Lankas fate in the tournament.
With off-spinner Akila Dananjaya out of the first two matches which are crucial for Sri Lankas progress to the next stage, the burden of responsibility will fall heavily on the shoulders of Malinga to deliver.
Dananjaya is staying back in Colombo awaiting the birth of his first child. He will be available for national duty soon afterwards.
The teams plans have been impeded somewhat, with injuries to senior batsman Dinesh Chandimal and batting all-rounder Danushka Gunathilaka. Niroshan Dickwella and Shehan Jayasuriya have come in as their replacements.
A lot will depend on whether Upul Tharanga the most experienced ODI cricketer in the side can transform his T20 domestic batting form into the international stage. The bane of Sri Lanka in the recent ODI series against South Africa was the failure of the openers to give the side a decent start.
We don't take any team lightly and we have focused on aspects such as the dew and wet wickets which are the swaying challenges I see, said Hathurusingha about dealing with the conditions in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, where the matches will be played.
Bangladesh are a team who have made great strides in recent years. Tamim Iqbal comes into the tournament with a good recent ODI record, having scored two centuries in the recent bi-lateral series with West Indies.
With him at the top of the order, they have the capacity to make rapid starts to their innings that could hurt the opposition. After bursting onto the scene three years ago, Mustafizur Rahman is a serious threat with his array of cutters with the ball but has suffered injury problems of late. Bangladesh will hope Shakib Al Hasan can regain full fitness by the start of the series as missing his all-round ability will create a major hole in the team.
The last time the two teams met in a fifty-over ODI Sri Lanka triumphed by 79 runs to win the final of the Tri-Nation Series in Dhaka in January this year.
NEW ASIA CUP FORMAT
There will be a total of 12 matches played across the two venues in UAE, culminating in the final at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on September 28.
In the first stage, the six teams are divided into two groups, A and B, with the three teams from each group playing the others in their group once.
The top two from each group will then progress to the Super Four, where they will face all other teams once. From there, the top two teams play each other in the final.

Brian Lara picks the toughest bowler he ever faced
He was the best left-handed batsman of his time and kept the pundits busy over deciding who was better between him and Indian batting legend Sachin Tendulkar.
But Brian Lara also has his share of respects for two among the greatest bowlers of his time and both are spinners. The former West Indian great had a tremendous on-field rivalry with the duo, something that remained cynosure of all eyes in modern-day cricket.
Lara scored over 22,000 runs in international cricket and had the remarkable feat of reclaiming the crown of the highest scorer in an innings in Test cricket from Australian Matthew Hayden. The former southpaw said though it was never easy to get away with former Sri Lankan off-spinner Muthiah Muralitharan, it was his duels with Australian leg-spin wizard Shane Warne that he enjoyed the most.
He was recently in New York as part of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 Trophy Tour where he during Reddit AMMA, He (Shane Warne) played for the best team in the world during my era, he was, and still is, regarded as the best leg-spinner to play the game. It was a battle I just embraced in some of the largest cricketing arenas.
Lara delivered against both Muralitharan and Warne in their respective dens during his playing days.
While he hit a scintillating 277 in Sydney in 1993 against an Australian team which had Warne in its ranks, he slammed 688 runs in three Tests against Sri Lanka that had Murali in 2001 even though the Caribbeans lost 0-3.
Muttiah (Muralitharan) always confused me in the early part of our confrontation, whilst Shane Warne didnt. Having said that, as my innings grew I felt I had more control over Muttiah, whilst Shane seemed to grow in confidence.
They were definitely the two best spinners of my time, Lara, 49, added. While Murali ended up as the highest Test wicket-taker with 800 scalps, Warne is the second in the list with 708 wickets to his name. ct

Campus Cricket creates international atmosphere, says former Royal-Thomian stars
Three cricketers presently making the transition into senior cricket are Chamika Karunaratne (Royal captain in the 2014 Big Match), Akthab Cader (St. Thomas fast bowler who also played in the 2014 Big Match), and Devind Pathmanathan (who captained Royal to victory in 2013). They play for different clubs and all three young cricketers play for their university side, Colombos Business Management School (BMS) at the Red Bull Campus Cricket World tournament.
Red Bull Campus Cricket - a global T20 tournament, with a World final due to be played in Colombo in September - is in its seventh year, and all three young cricketers play for their university side, Colombos Business Management School (BMS). Two years ago, BMS were world Champions, having defeated top university teams from South Africa and Bangladesh on their way to the title. Having won the Sri Lankan Campus Cricket tournament earlier this year, BMS are in the World Final tournament again, and will play five other teams from around the world.
Red Bull Campus Cricket is something we look forward to, and theres an atmosphere of an international tournament, says Cader, who was the leading fast bowler for Sinhalese Sports Club in the first-class tournament this year. There is a lot we can learn from teams that come from all over the world. And even in the local tournament that we have to win in order to qualify for the World Final, the competition is tougher year-on-year.
This year we just scraped through to be honest. Its high quality cricket. Tournaments such as Campus Cricket also help keep promising school cricketers in the system, says Karunaratne, who played for NCC in the most-recent domestic season.
When you study at Royal the dream is to play at the Big Match, and once you finish school, a lot of players concentrate only on their studies, or go overseas, Karunaratne says. So a tournament like Campus Cricket, where the competition is tough, and you get those high quality facilities and experience closer to what you get in international cricket, is really valuable.
Pathmanathan, a left-arm spinner who played the most recent season for Kalutara Town Club, but is likely to move back to a Colombo club for the forthcoming season, says Campus Cricket helped tide young cricketers over during their off-season. Generally you have the club season in the start of the year, and the mercantile cricket season later in the year, so its great to have a tournament like Campus Cricket to keep in touch during that period.
You also dont get to play a lot of high-quality T20 cricket at age group level in Sri Lanka, so this helps us hone those short-format skills as well. When I first started playing the Campus Cricket tournament a few years back, cricket administrators were a bit reluctant to let us play in the tournament, Karunaratne says. But now, they have seen the kind of quality the tournament produces. A lot of players from the other teams have gone on to play for their country. Now they are very happy for us to take time
and play the tournament.
The Campus Cricket World Final will feature teams from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and UAE, and will be played at NCC and SSC between September 23 and 29.

CID had no plans to arrest CDS - Information DG
Government Information Director-General Sudarshana Gunawardhana refuted media reports that said the CID had planned to arrest Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne.
The reports said the arrest was to be made in connection with allegations of the CDS protecting a wanted Navy Officer.
Gunawardhana said the CID on September 2, 2018 in a letter to the CDS had informed him to provide a statement regarding allegations of shielding an officer to evade court and or providing protection preventing him from being arrested.
The DG said that some of the print and electronic media, saying that a high ranking figure of a security force is to be arrested, was apparently providing publicity to the opinion of the Opposition that the government was on a mission to hunt war heroes.
Hettiarachchi Mudiyanselage Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi alias Navy Sampath was arrested by the CID on August 13, 2018 in connection with the abduction, torture, extortion and murder of 11 persons in 2008 and 2009.
The DG recalled that investigations into the abduction incident commenced on September 10, 2009 under the previous regime.
The question arises as to how interrogating the CDS becomes an issue of hunting war heroes.

Committee to probe oil spill
The Petroleum Industries Ministry will shortly appoint a committee to probe into the oil spill in the seas off Muthurajawela, Ministry Secretary Upali Marasinghe said.
He said the report of the Committee is expected in two weeks. The Committee will comprise officials representing the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), Ceylon Shipping Corporation Ltd, Sri Lanka Coast Guard and Petroleum Industries Ministry.
The Secretary said the Committee may obtain the assistance of experts where necessary.
A damaged ship-to-shore pipeline leaked fuel into the sea last Saturday while unloading furnace oil to the Muthurajawela Oil Refinery Complex causing heavy environmental damage to the adjacent coastal areas including Dikkowita, Thaldiyawatte and Uswettakeyyawa.
The Committee will probe as to how the leak occurred, the damage it caused and the persons responsible for it.
The MEPA, Sri Lanka Navy, Sri Lanka Army and Sri Lanka Coast Guard together with several other authorities were engaged in cleaning activities to minimise the environmental damage. MEPA General Manager Dr. Terney Pradeep Kumara said a complete eco-system recovery will take a few years.

Chandana Liyanapatabendi PC cited that the Commission can recover the outstanding amount by confiscating the assets of the CEB according to the PUCSL and CEB Acts.
He also requested the court to issue a order in this regard.
The judge after taking into the submissions made by the Counsel into account, decided to make inquiries from the CEB before issuing an Order.Attorneys-at-Law Dushmantha Peiris and Wijaya Gamage appeared on behalf of the PUCSL.

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said the Ministrys Investigation Unit is on a witch hunt against their members.
They have written to President Maithripala Sirisena requesting him to intervene to stop illegal and unacceptable acts of the Health Minister, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
He said the person appointed by the Health Minister to head the Investigations Unit is under investigation for charges levelled against him by the Public Service Commission.
Dr.Aluthge said disciplinary inquiries are conducted against doctors on anonymous complaints made against them.
This violates the system established in the public sector to carry out disciplinary inquiries against public sector employees. Sometimes investigators themselves make these complaints which is hilarious,he said.
The GMOA will not support such investigations and already informed to the Health Secretary.
