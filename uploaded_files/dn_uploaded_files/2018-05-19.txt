Iconic Australian commentator Bill Lawry retires from Channel Nine:
Its been a wonderful journey
One of the most iconic voices in the game, Australian commentator Bill Lawry
has called time on his career calling the game after four decades of service.
After Channel Nine recently lost the Australian television rights to broadcast cricket for the first time since the late 1970s, Lawry announced he will not move to the new broadcasters (Seven Network and Foxtel) and instead retire from the game.
Ive seen the best cricketers of the last 40 years, Ive been through the Packers years, Ive commentated with guys like Ian Healy and Mark Taylor and all the new boys, Lawry was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.Its just been a wonderful journey I never really expected.
Lawry explained that he couldnt leave Channel Nine after all the time he has spent with the network that has long been synonymous with cricket in Australia.
I had a phone call or two (from Seven and Foxtel), which is fair enough, he said. I said no because Channel Nine has been my home and Ive been very happy there. When youve had such an enjoyable trip, and at 81 years of age, I think its time to call quits. Its almost a dream come true.
Lawry, a former Australian captain himself who donned the Baggy Green for 67 Test matches, scoring more than 5000 runs at an average of 47, came to the fore as a commentator during Kerry Packers World Series of cricket in the late 70s. The Packer series is said to have revolutionised the game, especially on how it was packaged to the public.
I think the success of World Series Cricket was purely due to the quality of the cricketers, the World XI, a great West Indian team and Ian Chappell mustering an Australian team and the good coverage, Lawry was quoted as saying..
The highlight was being part of a team that Richie led. It was new territory for everybody, Richie was the key to it all and so calm and collected and then we had guys like Greigy and Ian Chappell coming in after the two years of playing and weve had all the visitors, the Ian Bothams and Michael Vaughan last year, Michael Holding and all the wonderful West Indian cricketers whove come on as commentators.

50 Greatest Players in World Cup History:
#40 Andrea Pirlo
I spent the afternoon of Sunday, July 9, 2006, in Berlin sleeping and playing the PlayStation. In the evening, I went out and won the World Cup.
Thats Andrea Pirlos describing how he went about the day on which the Italians stymied the French to the biggest prize in world football. And that, my lads, is why nobody does cool better than Andrea Pirlo.
Do not take the forbearance for complacency though. Andrea Pirlo was out there at the Olympiastadion in Berlin, displaying his immaculate passing ability in all its spectacular pomp, eagerly deliberated and calibrated like it was forensic science. The regista of registas pumped a delightful ball from the corner which was headed home by Marco Materazzi to equalize for the Italians after Zidane had put the French ahead.
He was there to take the first spot-kick in the shootout and coolly slotted it past Fabian Barthez to ease the nerves of his teammates.
No, Pirlo did not just show up for the finals and got the headline writers to throw bouquets at him. He was the general of an army of coarsened warriors and boy o boy, he lived up to that billing, one game after the other.
Remember Fabio Grossos astonishing strike against the Germans in the semi-final That was set up by some unblemished playmaking by Pirlo. He gathered the ball right outside the area and with the supporters urging him to go hell for leather, he took a couple of touches and shifted the ball to the right and gently guided it into the path of Grosso who had absolutely zero reservations about raining on ze Germans parade that night.
He had not just finished the World Cup of their lives on a high, he had also kicked it off in grand fashion. The Italians usually receive a lot of stick for being a bit boringly pragmatic in the early stages of the tournament. Pirlo took it upon himself to ensure that wasnt repeated. He scored the decisive goal in their opening game against Ghana and won the man of the match award. The answer to how crucial he was to the 2006 World Cup champions and their campaign is Pirlos 3 man of the match awards from the tournament; one of them came in the semifinal against Germany and the other the final against France.
And its not that Pirlo picked his games to shine. He shone right through and his performance against a dogged USA side that refused to back down is severely underrated.
In a game marred by red cards and controversy, Andrea Pirlo stepped it up and made sure the Americans did not laugh at their expense at the end of the night. He set up Alberto Gilardino for Italys only goal on the night. But his greatest contribution came after Daniele De Rossi was sent off for criminally elbowing Brian McBride.
The Italian midfield was in threat of getting overrun, but with the belligerent Gennaro Gattuso playing by his side, Pirlo held the fort down and Italy came away with a vital point. Pirlo says, I dont feel pressure. I dont give a toss about it. A poet on the field who weaved magic with the ball faster than David Blaine could scribble your friends name on a hanky, Pirlo pootled around the centre of the park like a saint meditating for an aha moment. Pirlos head is perceivably cooler than the freezer that houses your morning bacon. In Euro 2012, Italy and England would face off in the quarterfinals and the players would have a long night as the match got dragged into a penalty shootout.
With Joe Hart looking more confident about his abilities than a terrier who was acing fetch, Andrea Pirlo knew he had to put him off his game. As Pirlo approached the ball, you can see Joe Hart, all smiles and full of belief.
I made my decision at the last second when I saw Joe Hart doing all sorts on his line. As I began my run-up, I still hadnt decided what to do. Then he moved and my mind was made up. It was impromptu  the only way I could see of pushing my scoring chances close to 100 percent. There was no showboating  thats not my style. He talks about it like a convict defending himself after being accused of first-rate murder. It was indeed that. Pirlo had committed a filthy crime. He murdered Joe Harts booming conviction in himself with a panenka that hit the net about 2 seconds after the English goalkeeper had hit the ground.
That was Andrea Pirlo. If Cosa Nostra took over the footballing world in 2006, Andrea Pirlo was their Don Corleone. For being the alpha dog in a world of hounds spoiling for a fight, Andrea Pirlo is one of our 50 Greatest World Cup Players. - sk

50 Greatest Players in World Cup History:
#41 Romario
Its September the 18th, 1993. The FIFA World Cup is less than 9 months away, and the entire nation of Brazil is on its knees praying... if they dont win tomorrow - against those great rivals Uruguay - they dont make it to the tournament they consider their birthright.
No country does football quite like Brazil, and they were now having to imagine the unthinkable. A World Cup without Brazil Heads would roll, blood would flow.
Thats why Carlos Alberto Perreira, a strong man, a good man, has to go back on a decision hed said earlier was irrevocable. No, I wont recall Romario, hed snapped earlier in the year after being asked the question for the millionth time... in 1992, just as Romario was approaching the zenith of his form at PSV, Perreira had banned the always outspoken forward for complaining vocally about not being played for a friendly.
Any manager would have been irked if one of their players had said, I wouldnt have come from the Netherlands if I knew I wasnt going to play, but for a disciplinarian like Perreira this bordered on the criminal. Now, though, he didnt have a choice.
Brazil needed to win. They needed Romario.
The coach announced to the world that Brazils no. 11 tomorrow would be Romario (who was by then wreaking havoc at the top of Johann Cruyffs Barcelona Dream Team).
The local press thronged around their returning hero, their saviour-to-be, and asked him about the pressure, asked him about his expectations... I already know what is going to happen: Im going to finish Uruguay, he grinned in return.
So, on the 19th of September, 1993, he stepped out onto the Maracana and did just that.
Brazil won 2-0, sealing their trip to the United States, thanks to a clever header and a beautiful one-on-one finish from Romario - the latter showcasing the essence of his greatness ... he didnt just finish ruthlessly, he toyed with goalkeepers, gave them nightmares, made them question the purpose of their existence. Look at Roberto Siboldi in the Uruguayan goal. Look at the body language. Its the despair of a man whos been totally, completely, stripped of all professional dignity.
Nobody finishes one-on-ones, finishes off goalkeepers, quite like Romario these days.
After that show of individual brilliance - Perreira exclaimed after the match God sent Romario to the Maracana - there was no way he was sitting USA 94 out... and he duly delivered in the tournament proper.
He scored the opener against Russia in their first match as well as those against Cameroon and Sweden in the other two group games while he provided the assist for the solitary goal of their tough pre-quarter vs the United States (Bebeto scored, their strike partnership was brilliant throughout the tournament). He would then, once again, open the scoring for Brazil, in the quarters against the Netherlands while also scoring the solitary goal of the semifinal against Sweden... a trademark toe-poke (that playground trick that the great man had transformed into an art form, ugliness made beautiful through the simple trick of imaginative application).
He didnt score against Italy in the final - Franco Baresi putting in one of the greatest individual performances of all-time to stop him from doing so - but he did tuck away his penalty with dead-eyed precision and became the last player to end up with the World Cup and the Golden Ball at the end of it all.
In 1990, hed been able to play only 66 minutes after a severe thigh injury pre-tournament, in 1998 he wasnt able to recover from a muscular injury (that dream partnership of Ronaldo and Romario working together for just one year, 1997, when the two of them scored 34 goals and terrified the bejeesus of everyone who stood in their path) and in 2002 he was simply over the hill.
But for that one glorious summer in 1994, Brazils no. 11 was simply unstoppable, a 56 force of nature who combined raw pace with deceptive strength and an almost unfair abundance of skill and talent to earn his place in footballing folklore... and our list of 50 Greatest Players in World Cup History. - sk

Botham backs controversial 100-ball cricket format
LONDON May18: England great Ian Botham has backed controversial plans for a new city-based 100-ball competition despite widespread criticism from within the game.
The former all-rounder believes England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves is right to press ahead with the Hundred concept in the hope that it can match the global appeal of the Indian Premier League and Australias Big Bash, both played under Twenty20 rules.
But the Durham chairmans comments are in contrast to those of other current players, including his countys captain Paul Collingwood, who led England to their World Twenty20 victory in 2010 and believes a bigger effort should be made to exploit the existing competition, the T20 Blast.
Botham believes the new tournament, due to start in 2020, could compete with the other popular franchise leagues.

Buddhas Relics returned to Pakistan
The Buddha's most sacred relics from Taxila were taken back to Pakistan yesterday after conclusion of a three-week long exposition at various locations in Sri Lanka.
Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, high government officials and diplomats from Pakistan High Commission were present at the Bandaranaike International Airport to see off the Relics. The sanctified Relics were sent by the Government of Pakistan on a special request of Sri Lanka in connection with the Annual Buddha Rashmi National Vesak Festival. During the exposition in Sri Lanka, millions of devotees paid their homage to the Sacred Relics, excavated from Taxila, Pakistan
The exposition of the Relics commenced on April 29 by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe amidst a large gathering of Buddhist clergy, scholars, Ministers, Parliamentarians and high level government functionaries at Temple Trees.
The Relics were exhibited in different temples at Colombo, Wellampitiya, Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Kurunegalla, Anuradhapura and Kandy where hundreds of thousands of devotees visited the Relics daily and performed rituals.
The Relics were originally discovered near the Dharmarajika stupa, the earliest and largest Buddhist complex at Taxila, Pakistan built in the 3rd century BC to house the Relics by the famous Mauryan king Asoka, who was also known as Dharmaraja for his services to Buddhism.
Dharmarajika was excavated by Ghulam Qadir in 1912-16 under the directions of Sir John Marshall and A.D. Siddiqui in 1934-36. The advent and development of Buddhism owes a great deal to the ancient land of Pakistan. It was here that the religious activities of Buddhism reached its climax through well-organized missionaries and ultimately made it a international religion.

Colombo Mayor suspends parking meter fines
Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake yesterday instructed the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Commissioner to suspend all fines charged from parking meters in the city.
The Mayor through her official twitter account tweeted, With regard to the recent complaints on parking meter fines. Pending council approval I have given instructions to the commissioner to suspend all fines charged relating to parking meters.
The new parking meters set up around Colombo have caused a stir among the public with not only the system of payment but also with many not being aware that a parking meter functioned in the area, thus running fines amounting to several thousands.
The media recently reported an incident where a man in Wellawatte who had failed to pay his parking fee of Rs.30, had been fined Rs.10,120 after a lapse of 13 days.
His complaint went viral on social media with the Mayor as well as opposition members assuring that the matter would be resolved.
CMC member Milinda Rajapaksha on his twitter on May 15 stated that the CMC had discussed the issue of parking meters at its council meeting and that they had discussed the need to restructuring of the fine and operating system of parking meters.
In 2015, the CMC signed a public private partnership agreement with Tenaga Car Parks (Pvt) Ltd to manage several parking locations in Colombo. The company has been authorised to manage the parking meters and collect the fines.
Tenaga accordingly manages parking along Galle Road (from the Galadari Junction to the Dehiwala Bridge) and Duplication Road (from Liberty Plaza Junction to Dharmarama Road), including all intersecting by-lanes.

Could be last chance for generation of LatAm football greats
BOGOTA - The eight Latin American squads who qualified for the 2018 World Cup will put some of footballs biggest stars on the field when the tournament gets underway next month in Russia. And though the young are taking over, there is a number that is magic and common among some of the most outstanding football stars on the continent and who will soon be on their way to Russia.
One month before the tourney begins, 31 will be the age of several players representing Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Uruguay at the kick-off. In the 31 Club is the individual rated by many as the best footballer of all. Barcelona icon Lionel Messi will turn that age on June 24 during the tourney and his objective in Russia is to lead Argentina to win their third World Cup.
Uruguay, also a two-time champion, will have on their roster two of the greatest strikers to set foot on Russian football fields, Paris Saint-Germains Edinson Cavani and Baras Luis Suarez, both 31.
Keylor Navas, goalkeeper for Real Madrid and Costa Rica, at age 31 will defend his countrys goal for the second time in the World Cup, while Colombian forward Carlos Bacca, who also plays in Spain with Villarreal, is the same age. Mexico has Andres Guardado in their squad.
The midfielder for Real Betis was born on September 28, 1986 and in his 31st year will defend the colours of his country for the fourth time in a World Cup. And with 31 as their magic number, Messi, Suarez, Cavani, Keylor and Guardado only await the 31-day countdown for the ball to start rolling in Russia to begin working at winning the World Cup.  IANS

Declaration of Intent signed to protect marine resources
Businesses, the Sri Lankan Government, French Government and representatives of the scientific community yesterday signed a Declaration of Intent between Sri Lanka and France to protect the marine resources of the country.
The organizations Biodiversity Sri Lanka, MIND led by Prof. Mohan Munasinghe, IUCN, the French Development Agency, together with companies like Aitken Spence Travels, Dialog Axiata, Dilmah Ceylon Tea, MAS intimates, Tess Pvt. Ltd., Tokyo Cement signed an expression of interest to start with the pilot project of working together to conserve the coastal belt from Vakarai to Batticaloa.
French Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Jean-Marin SCHUH speaking at the event held at the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies said France was very interested in helping Sri Lanka conserve its marine environment and that the two countries had much to share in terms of knowledge.
With France part of the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI), he hoped that Sri Lanka too can through this project consider entering into the ICRI, to benefit from 60 other countries who are facing similar threats to its coral reefs.
Prof. Munasinghe offering his research expertise to the initiative said coastal belts offered immense potential for blue economic growth of nations, with over 60 percent of the worlds GNP being generated within a 100km of the ocean.
However, due to human actions which have polluted and over-exploited the marine resource, by 2010, almost 60 percent fish stocks were said to be exploited outside their safe biological limits.
Over 55 percent of Sri Lankan population depends on coastal resources. But marine resources contribute less than 2 percent to GDP, although our territorial resources are eight times the size of our land resource, he added.
The Blue Green initiative thus seeks to promote economic growth and livelihoods by protecting the marine environment.
The recent report on the Presidential Expert Committee on Sustainable Sri Lanka 2030 in which Prof. Munasinghe is also part of highlighted the development of the marine sector, he explained.
It focused on marine pollution, ocean acidification due to climate change, coastal degradation, a dwindling fish catch and the finally huge problems with sustainable utilization and governance.
First we need to prioritise which of these ocean resources are more important, who uses them and then where do you put these resources in terms of monetary and environmental terms and then we can recommend practical policies to government, businesses and communities on how to manage these resources, he said further.
The most important endeavour in this project, he said, was to have sound research and that public, private and the government sector had to be part of this research.
The Declaration of Intent signed between the French Ambassador and the Secretary to the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Anura Dissanayake will also have France help the Sri Lankan government implement projects related to the blue-green economy.

Djokovic reaches first quarter-final of 2018 in Rome
Rome, Thursday: Novak Djokovic moved into his first quarter-final of 2018 on Thursday when he defeated Spain's Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-1, 7-5 at the Italian Open.
The four-time Rome champion is making his way back this year after a six-month injury absence before the Australian Open, which was followed by elbow surgery.
And the 30-year-old showed some of his old form as he got past Ramos-Vinolas to set up a rematch with Japan's Kei Nishikori for a semi-final berth.
The 11th-seeded Serb, who has reached eight of the last ten finals in Rome, beat Nishikori in the first round in Madrid last week before falling in the second to Britain's Kyle Edmund.
"I'm happy. I haven't had too many matches of this quality of my tennis in the last 12 months," said the 12-time Grand Slam champion whose last quarter-final run came at Wimbledon last year.
"I think this was probably one of the three matches that I played this way in the last 12 months. So, it felt good.
"And it came at the right time in the place where I love to play, where I get a lot of support.
"I'm just trying to thrive on this energy that I get from people here. I've historically always played well in Rome, and I feel like each match is getting better."
Former world number one Djokovic has slipped six places to 18th after his second-round defeat in Madrid, his lowest ranking since October 2006.
Nishikori, ranked 24, who retired in the second round in Barcelona last month with a leg injury, needed just over an hour to see off Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-1, 6-2 at the Foro Italico. - AFP

Donald Trump tells Kim Jong-un: Denuclearisation or Decimation
US: United States President Donald Trump has threatened North Korean leader Kim Jong-un with decimation, unless he agrees to denuclearise the Korean peninsula.
With the June 12 US-North Korea summit at stake, Mr. Trump on Thursday gave Mr. Kim two options  reach an agreement to denuclearise and remain in power or suffer the fate of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who was overthrown and murdered by rebels who were supported by a NATO bombing campaign in 2011, Efe news reported.
If you look at that model with Gaddafi, that was a total decimation. We went in there to beat him. Now that model would take place if we dont make a deal, most likely, Trump told reporters prior to his meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the White House.
But if we make a deal, I think Kim Jong-un is going to be very, very happy, the President added.
Trump, however, said that the United States is not using the Libyan model in its negotiations with North Korea, distancing himself from National Security Adviser John Bolton, who had explicitly mentioned the Libya model of 2003-2004 as a basis for talks with Pyongyang.
In 2003, Muammar Gaddafi agreed to eliminate his countrys weapons of mass destruction in exchange for US economic incentives, although the agreement purportedly did not give Gaddafi any security guarantees.
By Libyan model, Trump seemed to be referring to the 2011 NATO bombing campaign against the Libyan government, which helped rebels overthrow Gaddafi, who was soon brutally murdered by these groups.
The Libyan model isnt the model we have at all when we are thinking of North Korea. In Libya, we decimated that country ... There was no deal to keep Gaddafi, Mr. Trump said.
This with Kim Jong-un would be something where he would be there. He would be running his country. His country would be very rich, the President added.
Trump said that if Kim agreed to denuclearize, hell get protections that would be very strong, referring to guarantees for the North Korean leader to remain in power.
Trump also downplayed Pyongyangs threats to pull out of the US-North Korea summit planned for June 12 in Singapore, saying North Koreas actually talking to us about times and everything else as though nothing happened.
Our people are literally dealing with them right now, Trump added.

England will struggle with fatigue at World Cup, says Eriksson
LONDON, Friday - Englands players will struggle with fatigue at next months World Cup in Russia because of the demands of their domestic season, former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson told the BBC.
The Swede, who managed England at the 2002 and 2006 World Cups and Euro 2004, said the lack of a mid-season break was the reason why England regularly under-performed at major international tournaments.
If you play in the Premier League, you play a lot of games, he said. Theres two big domestic cups, most England players play in Europe and the league is tough. Thats OK, but the big problem is not having a break.
Thats the biggest reason why England struggle to make a big impact in big tournaments.
England boss Gareth Southgate named a youthful squad for the World Cup and Eriksson believes there are plenty of goals in the side.
I like the squad, he said. There are a lot of young players, hungry players that want to show what they can do.
I like the strikers because they can do things on their own, they have pace and they can score goals. Im very curious to see how they will do. On the counter-attack, having those players available can be very, very dangerous.
I hope they can go further than I did and reach a semi-final. If so, everything is possible. I hope for Southgate and the players, but especially for the country and the fans. It would be great for them to have a team going further than the quarter-finals.
England play friendlies against Nigeria and Costa Rica on June 2 and June 7 before leaving for Russia where they are in World Cup Group G along with Belgium, Panama and Tunisia.

Follow conscience, Minister asks doctors, nurses
Nurses and doctors should inquire from their conscience if they work in line with the Nightingale Pledge and the Hippocratic Oath on this day of International Nurses' Day, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne on Wednesday said.
He was addressing the gathering at the celebration of the International Nurses Day-2018 at Temple Trees, organised by the Government Nursing Officers' Association.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickeremesinghe participated as Chief Guests.
If the nurses act in accordance with the Nightingale Pledge, it will be a great service to the health sector and country, the Minister said.
The Minister said nurses should not take into account race, religion, language, colour, creed or the caste of patients.
He appreciated Government Nursing Officers' Association President Saman Ratnapriya for disregarding the differences.
The Minister said the nurses enjoy the salary increments granted to the public servants.
He said Rs. 10,000 was increased for public servants and it amounted to Rs. 120,000 annually.
"The Cost of Living Allowance and other allowances had also increased," the Minister said. A 19-storey Nurses' Faculty is being constructed now, while a 16-storey hostel is constructed in Mulleriyawa. Four nursing schools will be constructed in Kandy, Anuradhapura, Kalutara and Galle.
The Public Health Nursing Service has recommenced and 100 were already recruited and another 100 will be recruited in June," he said. He said a Cabinet paper was submitted to increase salaries of graduate nurses and measures would be taken to increase the number of male nurses.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Government Nursing Officers' Association President Saman Ratnapriya spoke.

GMOA Secretary Dr.Haritha Aluthge said this will make sure that people agree to sign such an agreement knowing all facts and figures on signing foreign trade agreements.
The GMOA stressed the need to introduce a National Policy on signing FTAs.This is because FTAs stand though Governments change time to time, he added.
He said Parliamentary approval is inadequate for FTAs because it is Sri Lanka (the state) which signs and not the ruling political party or the Government in power.

The International Monetary Fund supports Sri Lankas new automatic fuel pricing formula, IMF Spokesperson Gerry Rice said in Washington, D.C. on Thursday.
We think the automatic fuel pricing mechanism marks a major step toward completing the energy pricing reforms that are underway in Sri Lanka, while minimising the fiscal risks, the IMF Spokesperson said.
If implemented properly, the formula-based pricing would eliminate fuel subsidies that benefit the rich rather than the poor, he added.
Sri Lanka increased the prices of petrol, diesel, and kerosene this month following a Cabinet decision. Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the price would be adjusted every two months, based on Platts Singapore benchmark prices.
On Thursday, Rice confirmed that the IMF board would discuss Sri Lankas fourth review of the fourth review of their US$ 1.5 billion stabilisation programme on June 1.

Interim order extended till September 11
The Court of Appeal yesterday further extended its Interim Order staying any further proceeding into the controversial almanac case filed against former Minister Basil Rajapaksa before High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga, who is currently presiding over Court No.6 of the Colombo High Court, until September 11.
Court of Appeal Justice Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Justice Janak de Silva made the order consequent to a Transfer Application filed by former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa seeking an order staying any further proceedings into the almanac case heard before Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
Meanwhile, the transfer application was fixed for inquiry on September 10 by the Court of Appeal.
Rajapaksa has sought an order transferring the case from the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga to any other High Court of Colombo.
Judge Kulatunga delivered the judgment regarding the Controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case. Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC.
In his petition, Basil Rajapaksa stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of the Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC), which initiated an inquiry against him. He further stated that one of the primary grounds in which the proceedings before the PRECIFAC are sought to be challenged by him before the Court of Appeal complaining that he was denied a fair hearing at the purported inquiry by the PRECIFAC.
On November 15, last year, the High Court case against two accused including former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa for allegedly misappropriating Rs.29.4 million of funds belonging to Divi Neguma Department was fixed for trial to be heard on a day-to-day basis beginning November 24 by Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against the former Minister and former Director General of Divi Neguma Department Kithsiri Ranawaka in the Colombo High Court for allegedly printing five million almanacs with the image of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, costing Rs.29.4 million, to be used as election propaganda material during January 2015 presidential election.

Singer A Division inter-schools league rugby 2nd round:
Isipathana go out favourites against Trinity today
Isipathana College will go out as clear favourites against Trinity College, Kandy when they scrum down in their second round Singer A Division inter-schools league rugby encounter at Havelock Park at 4pm today.
The two teams look almost even but Isipathna has a firm edge due to having a better winning record thus far.
Trinity has managed to win only two games from six matches while Isipathana has five wins under their belt from the same number of matches.
Isipathana are also playing in front of their home crowd in Colombo which is also an added advantage.
Trinity will make every effort to upset the odds and beat the Isipathana lads in their own den. But for that to happen it would mainly depend on how the Trinity three quarters will make use of the good ball.
Trinity has always enjoyed the luxury of speedy and penetrative set of three quarters and there will be no exception this time too. If the Trinity forwards could secure good ball and feed their three quarter line more often, then Isipathana will face a tough task.
Nevertheless the green machine has its own strength to give the Lions a testing time as they could boast of a mobile eight who will use their heavy forwards to score through the famous rolling maul  a tactic used successfully by their forward coach Henry Terence.
The team that takes control of the game within the first 30 minutes should hold the key to winning this encounter.
Royal holds clear edge over Wesley
High riding Royal College Colombo will go out with a clear edge against unpredictable Wesley College in their Singer A Division inter school league rugby tournament second round match to be played at Longden Place at 4 pm today.
The Royal lads under the leadership of winger Sabith Feroz have an immaculate record in this years ongoing league rugby tournament where they are yet to lose a game being unbeaten.
Royals cause has been bolstered by the presence of their ever reliable forwards who have carried out a sensational display this season together with their whole eight dominating the set pieces and having abundance of ball position through line outs, rucks and mauls spearheaded by crack flanker cum vice-captain Maleesha Madumevan and prop forward Sasitha Siyath.
They have also been helped by their speedy three quarter line scoring tries through their famous three quarter moves. They also have a reliable place kicker in full back Dulan Gunawardena and his contribution in this match will be highly vital for a Royal victory.
On the other hand Wesley College possesses a good team with play maker Murshid Doray along with their entire three quarter line capable of playing an outstanding game to bring victory to their school. But their performances have been blow hot and blow cold and they are feeling the string of losses suffered at the hands of St. Peters, Isipathana and St. Josephs.
This will be a do or die battle for the Campbell Park school for if they lose this battle to Royal it could be worse for them as they will slip further down in the standings.
Joes look for runaway win over hapless Zahira
The confrontation between St.Josephs College Colombo and Zahira College Maradana in the Singer 'A' Division inter-Schools league rugby second round match at Zahira grounds today, should turn out to be a one-sided affair. The match will kick off at 4.00 pm.
St.Josephs who beat Wesley last week under the coaching of former national rugby coach Nilfer Ibrahim will go out as firm favourites. The forte of the Joes has been their speedy three quarter line who are certain to give a torrid time to the Zahirian outfit.
Zahira will have to be at their very best if they are to at least make a match of it against this formidable Joes side. Going by the two team's starting line ups and the performance so far in the ongoing league tournament, Joes will completely go for a thrashing of Muammar Deens Zahira outfit today.

Los Angeles, Friday: Five-time Olympic swimming champion Katie Ledecky followed up her world record-shattering 1,500m freestyle performance with the second-fastest 400m free in history at the Pro Swim Series in Indianapolis on Thursday.
Ledecky won the 400m freestyle in three minutes 57.94 seconds, second only to her own world record of 3:56.46 set in winning gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
She returned to the pool later to finish fifth in the 100m freestyle. "I had two really great swims," said Ledecky, who sliced five seconds off her own 1,500m free world record on Wednesday with a time of 15:20.48sec.
"I was just trying to make a few improvements off of this mornings swims, just pacing and being a little more controlled.
"I still had a little too high of a tempo in the first 50 of my 400, but overall I was really pleased with the swim, the time."
This week's meeting in Indianapolis is the 21-year-old star's first since turning professional following the NCAA collegiate championships in March.
Other US Olympians touching first on Thursday included Nathan Adrian in the mens 100m free in 48.69, Kelsi Dahlia in the women's 100m butterfly in 57.38, Gunnar Bentz in the mens 100m fly in 53.03 and Melanie Margalis in the women's 200m breaststroke in 2:24.62.

Legalisation of Cannabis will not increase consumption  Expert Study
The effect of legalizing marijuana internationally will not lead to an explosion in consumption, according to an industry report prepared by GT Research, the US-based biotechnology analytics arm of the GTV Capital hedge fund. The analysis is most striking given the source, as GTV is specifically targeted at the biopharmaceutical sector, with a particular focus on the budding cannabis industry.
Last month, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne reiterated plans for the establishment of a 100-acre cannabis farm, expected to produce over 25 tons of the controlled substance per annum, in a bid to meet demands for Ayurvedic preparations.
When the plans were first announced last year, Minister Senaratne highlighted the plight of Ayurvedic doctors who currently depend on cannabis stocks from confiscated narcotic stockpiles to prepare their medicines.
By the time our native doctors get this cannabis, it is about four to five years old and it has lost its effectiveness, the minister said.
The Health Ministry plan, slated to be brought before Cabinet shortly, envisions farmers cultivating the crop under the supervision of the military. After meeting local needs for ayurvedic medicinal preparations, the government hopes to export surplus from the farm to jurisdictions where the herb has been legalized for widespread use, such as parts of the United States, and Canada.
Canadas impending full-legalization of marijuana was discussed in-depth in the GT Research study, titled Right-Sizing the Canadian Recreational Cannabis Market, which is available to industry insiders on the firms website. According to the study cited in Forbes, most Canadian consumers would rather continue to purchase cannabis on the black market, rather than pay a premium for legitimate supplies. A whopping 37% of heavy consumers wouldnt participate in the [recreational cannabis market] at a $1 legal premium, Forbes quotes the report as stating.
While the GT report expresses skepticism of sky high market expectations following legalization in Canada and elsewhere, the firm remains bullish on the budding cannabis industry as a whole, according to Damitha Pathmalal, Portfolio Manager at GTV Capital and Director of Research at GTs analytics arm.
You can be informed, do your due diligence and be strategically optimistic about where the cannabis market is going, or you can fall for the dotcom era style hype and the inevitable pump-and-dump type schemes that are almost certain to infect this sector in the years to come, cautioned Pathmalal. Our fiduciary duty to our investors is to deploy capital to the wheat and steer clear of the chaff.
Such an endeavour would be easier said than done, according to Gitendra E. Chitty, Director of the Strategic Advisory Practice at KPMG Sri Lanka.
During the dotcom bubble of the early 2000s, a lot of otherwise very savvy investors and fund managers were taken up by the hype of the tech boom, and threw due diligence to the wind, Chitty, who at the time oversaw an internal software platform at the headquarters of General Electric, recalled.
While some institutional investors have learned these lessons the hard way, the scandal at Theranos has reminded us all of the need for fund managers to thoroughly vet biotech investments, cut through the hype and ask tough questions of their portfolio companies, he warned. Chitty was referring to the recent $500,000 fraud settlement between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and biotechnology darling Theranos, which, founded in 2003, was once valued at over 9 billion dollars. In a nutshell, the company was accused of raising more than $700 million from investors through an elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the companys technology, business and financial performance.
Despite the imminent likelihood of a local export market for cannabis in Sri Lanka, GTV is not exploring local investment opportunities, according to Pathmalal. While our mandate does not restrict us to a specific region, we need to look at the bigger picture of any local market in considering any international investment, Pathmalal said.
I feel sad to say this as a Sri Lankan, but the structural issues in the local market make us wary to engage here without relying on political patronage. Ours is a Special Situations fund and not a Special Relationships one. For example, the ongoing controversy around insider trading in Central Bank Bondswhich are the most sacrosanct investment in any economywas a giant red flag to us.
Pathmalal is no stranger to workings of the Sri Lankan capital markets. Before moving to the United States for his MBA degree from Duke University, Pathmalal lived and grew up in Sri Lanka from his childhood, having attended the Asian International School and Colombo International School, before earning his undergraduate degree and later working for Moodys Analytics and Dialog Axiata in Colombo in the areas of research, strategy, and corporate development.
As long as the government remains in the business of picking winners and losers, the engine of creative destruction that is necessary for true innovation in this or any other sector is unlikely to take root in Sri Lanka, Pathmalal cautioned. History doesnt repeat itself but it rhymes. The local economic policy-making bodies bear a striking resemblance to Venices Great Council, which was comprised of the business leaders of the time and informed government policy. It ostensibly fostered economic growth but by its design was a protectionist old boys club. In 1330 Venice was the size of Paris and three times larger London. It is now a city that is literally under water and a museum for tourists.

Local companies play major role in construction of expressways - PM
The country's construction industry has developed to a great extent under the Good Governance Government with Expressways being constructed by local construction companies, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said that the Second Phase of the Central Expressway is being extended and the Government will provide all support and facilities to local companies involved in the construction work.
He added that the Private and Government sectors will have greater involvement in the construction industry in the coming decade.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was speaking after inaugurating Build Sri Lanka - 2018, the premier Housing and Construction Exhibition organised by the Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka (CCI).
The exhibition which is being conducted for the 14th consecutive year is be held from May 18 to May 20 at the BMICH.
The Prime Minister added that work on the Second Phase of the Central Expressway is being carried out by the local construction companies and would be completed within the given time framework.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added that there are many areas to be developed in the constrution sector in addition to the construction of Expressways which would strengthen the economy, such as, infrastructure and private sector participation.
We have recommenced the rural housing project programme that was initiated by late President R. Premadasa, the Prime Minister said. The demand for houses is not limited only to the rural sector. There is a demand for houses in the urban areas, suburbs and in the North as well. We will give priority by catering to the housing requirements of middle income earners, the Prime Minister said.
He further said the government has received USD 200 million from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
The Government would also look into the housing needs of the Northen people.The government had provided houses to a section of the people who lost their properties due to the war, the Premier said.
Estate sector people have no plots of lands to construct their houses and they too should be provided with houses, the Premier said.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi allocated money for that purpose. We have to find lands for that purpose after holding discussions with the estate companies. We would have to acquire lands in those areas where the estate companies do not have space, the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Wickemesinghe also said that the housing loan scheme for the middle income class would commence soon. Loans would be granted through the National Savings Banks for this purpose.
The Premier said that the CCI is a key player in Sri Lanka's economy.
He added that the CCI makes the largest contribution to the construction induistry.
There are two Ministers responsible for the construction industry, one being Megapolis Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka who attends to modernizing the Sri Lankan construction industry while the other being Sajith Premadasa who attends to Construction Ministry plans, the Prime Minister said.
We are eternally grategul to the Armed Forces personnel who made great sacrifices to end terrorism in the country. We have to recall the fact that a large number of innocent people died due to terrorism, the Prime Minister said.
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa also adressed spoke on the occasion. Past President of CCI Engineer Maj. Ranjith Gunathilake, CCI Past President Deshabandu Dr. Surath Wickramasinghe, CCI Vice President Mahanama Jayamanna and CCI Secretary General Eng Nissanka N.Wijeratne also were present on the occasion.

Trinity v Isipatana at Havelock Park
Havelock Park rugby ground will be bursting at the seams packed with rugby fanatics today for the second round inter-school league rugby clash between Trinity and Isipathana. A thrilling game of rugby is in store when the eagerly awaited confrontation between rival schools scrum down. Both schools are great crowd pullers and in the past whenever they met have produced unrelenting brand of rib bruising rugby.
TCK Scrummage  notifies abrogation of duties
The Old Trinitians Rugby Scrummage secretary's letter dated 9 May, has notified to the Principal abrogation of duties. The letter says that they will keep off from all rugby related duties with effect from 11 May 2018. This decision was taken during a special committee meeting held on 1 May.
They say the fundamental reason for this committee decision is their losing confidence in the OTRCs objectives to promote the advancement and progress of rugby at Trinity College. This committee comprised people like Dharshana Munasinghe chairman, Tyrone Smith and Hemanga Karunasena vice chairmen, Asanka Ranhotty koty secretary, Sustik Inoch treasurer and Rohan Abeykoon, immediate past chairman.
Hillwoodians win netball titles
Hillwood Girls College under 20 netball ball team led by Thirani Welianga, the under 18 led by Jayathri Wijewardena and under 16 by Puthra Devadasan emerged champions at the Sports Festival organized by the Department of Education. It was a great achievement by the school to win all three netball titles. They received their awards from Chief Guest Sarath Ekanayake, Chief Minister. It was also a proud moment for the principal Nelum de Alwis who gives a big hand for sports promotion at Hillwood.
Dharmaraja Colleg Principal heads schools hockey

In the Girls section, second was Swarnamali BMV and third Girls High School. In the Boys section second was St, Sylvesters College and third Dharmaraja College.
Tickets prices sky high at schools rugby
School rugby crowds could soon keep off from matches if ticket prices continue to rise. School rugby supporters say the present school match tickets are highly priced and Kandy schools rugby risks losing an entire generation of young fans. Rugby was more affordable at one time, now they have broken that habit. The reason behind it is only Trinity have their own grounds for rugby. They give some schools free for matches when it is not used by them. Schools like Vidyartha, Sylvesters, Dharmaraja, Kingswood, Sri Sumangala, St. Anthonys and Rahula who have no grounds of their own for matches have to spend nearly Rs. 100,000 as ground fee so naturally the gate fee goes up. From that figure too they have to pay a 25% entertainment tax. When schools play their matches at Bogambara due to the hardness of the ground there are lot of injuries to players.
Old Royalist win at golf
At the 3rd golf tournament played the day before the 2nd leg of the Bradby Royal College old boys led by Andy Anderson beat Trinity College Old boys captained by Chandima Desinghe.

Ashroff, a product of St.Sylvesters College later played for Young Stars SC and Kandy and is one of the best hockey coaches in the country today. He has been coaching the school for many years and has helped them win many championships.
Vidyartha take on Rajans at rugby
In a plate second round inter-school rugby game, Dharmaraja who are without a win will take on Vidyartha at the Bogambara Stadium today. Vidyartha should go out favourite to defeat the out of form Dharmaraja. The battle up front will be between the two respective sets of forwards. With the two outfits hell bet on winning that extra bit of possession is vital in order to provide even the slightest edge for their respective back divisions to click. Fans could be assured of good fast open rugby if both teams play to the standards they are capable of.
KMR should continue as president
The AGM of the Kandy Club is in the month of June. The opinion of the general membership is that the incumbent president K.M.R. Kulatunga should continue, as he has good control and commands the respect of both the members and staff.
Gateway U20 boys champs, girls runner-up
Gateway College Kandy basketball team won the Boys under 20 team led by Indrajith Bandara while their girls team ended runner-up in the Central Province Basketball Tournament 2018.

Massacre in Gaza
Israeli Defense Forces opened fire and killed 65 persons including women and children and injured 3,188 in a brutal massacre since May 14. The youngest to die was an 8 month old baby girl.
This was the brutal reaction of the apartheid state of Israel against Palestinians who were protesting peacefully against the illegal occupation of their own land. Not only were they unarmed but men, women and children whole families took part in it. They were inside Gaza-their homeland, an enclave which has been converted into a prison house by Israel by cordoning them off and denying even basic facilities such as water and electricity. In attacking the protesters Israel Defence forces used not only tear gas and live bullets but also fighter jets and tanks.
They were commemorating the great catastrophe, called Naqba in Arabic. Naqba was the eviction of 700,000 Palestinians from their homeland during 1947  48 when the United Nations decided to create two states-one Arab and other Jewish on Palestine territory. Though Israel  the Jewish state, was forcibly created the other has not been created yet. The commemoration this year was the 70th annual event.
The protest this year was also for another reason. That is the opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem violating international agreements and resolutions of the United Nations.
According to international agreements Jerusalem was considered a city common and sacred to all  Jews, Muslims and Christians. Its status was to be decided as the last act of a peace process. This forced the Palestinians to start their protest on May 14th - the date of opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem, a day ahead of the Naqba Day on May 15. The protest called the Great Return March continues heroically despite the massacre.
The international community is outraged at this aggressive and brutal suppression of the protest which actually amounts to genocide. Demonstrations in solidarity with the fighting Palestinians were held in Chicago, London, Berlin, Rome, Tunis and several other cities in the world. Turkey has expelled the Israeli Ambassador. South Africa withdrew its Ambassador from Israel. Belgium and Ireland summon their Israel Ambassadors and called for explanations.
World leaders including the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and UN Human Rights Chief Prince Saed Raad al  Hussein have condemned Israeli killings. The Arab League met in emergency session in Cairo to coordinate actions to counter US and Israeli action in Gaza. The Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) is meeting today (18) in Istanbul over the same issue. Leaders of Russia, China, Britain, Turkey and several other countries have condemned the US and Israeli conduct.
Strangely or not so strangely Saudi Arabia and several Middle Eastern Arab countries are silent on the issue, thus displaying their loyalty with the United States. The United States also vetoed a resolution in the UN Security Council calling for an investigation into the massacre in Gaza.
Meanwhile the Western media are conducting a campaign of vilification against Palestinians and their resistance movement Hamas calling them terrorists and depicting the aggressive state of Israel as a victim of terrorism. Unfortunately media in the Third World also participate in the dissemination of this false claim.
It is time that all who desire peace get together and oppose the aggression against Palestine by Israel and the United States.
Trump  Kim Summit in danger
A cloud of uncertainty has enveloped the summit meeting between President Donald Trump of the United States and President Kim Jong Un of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12. This is a sequel to some unwelcome comments by US Presidential Security Advisor John Bolten urging North Korea to follow the Libyan model of denunciation and North Korea cancelling the scheduled North South Summit scheduled prior to it. The North Korean action was a reaction to the US-South Korean military drills named Max Thunder that are being held now with the participation of 1,000 US and 500 South Korean troops using 100 war planes including - 12 radar evading fighters, an unspecified number of B- 52 bombers and F -15K jets. North Korea has described the drills as an undisguised challenge, a deliberate military provocation and a rehearsal for invading North Korea.
North Koreas First Vice  Minister of Foreign Affairs Kim Kya Gwon has reportedly said, If the Trump Administration pushes us into a corner and force us to give up our nuclear weapons unilaterally, then we will no longer take interest in Summit talks and would have to reconsider.
China has, however, urged North Korea to proceed with the Summit. North Korea has taken several positive steps in preparation for the Summit. It has a weapon test site on May 25  27 and even invited foreign journalists including those from the US to witness it.
US position is less clear. While US Secretary of State has said that the US and North Korea are in complete agreement with the objectives of the Summit John Bolton and several others have played a different tune.

Millions wasted on milk producing project
An audit report had revealed that 133 cows imported to Sri Lanka had died, 140 are infertile and another 69 are barren. The cows were imported to produce milk.
All Island Farmers Association President Namal Karunaratne said the previous and present governments had misused a large sum on the project.
Nearly Rs. 400 million was spent on shipping cows to the island and to transport them to Ridiyagama. The transportation alone cost the government Rs. 560,000, he said.

Mutual respect, the key to equality
My friend scorned me, The horun hoyana new court is for the consumption of the Sinhala masses that may be moving to the Mahinda Chinthana fold. We should question why there is no maruwan hoyana special judicial process for Tamil victims of war, waiting for nine years. This was promised in 2015. I think this week which marks the ninth year is the best to bring that up. Although the government set up the OMP that started work last weekend, the findings will not be made public and no legal action will be taken against perpetrators. Victims have no faith in the OMP. They made it very clear at the first meeting in Mannar.
Please have a look at these two reports. One names the criminals who are enjoying perks as war heroes'.
I assured him that democratic mass movement will keep its pressure on the government. It is true, after two years in the making, the body's members were appointed in February this year. OMP Chairman Saliya Pieris acknowledged that families are finding it hard to trust the body, but insisted that the organisation has more powers than previous commissions. It is an institution set up by the state, but which is able to act independently and able to investigate and to trace people who have been missing or disappeared and their circumstances, whoever the perpetrator is, he told Al Jazeera.
Tamil armed groups
In 1988, the conflict between the Tamil nationality and the Sinhala majority became serious with Sinhala armed groups backed by DJV - Sinhala chauvinist political group, attacking all those who stood for settlement through equality, and autonomy with devolution. Over forty thousand Sinhala youth disappeared in the south.
Later, in the struggle between the state and the Tamil armed groups, latter lost 100,000 lives, displaced hundreds of thousands of people and left indelible scars on the country. Recently families of those disappeared and activists in the northern island of Mannar were invited by the OMP to share their thoughts and expectations. But many are skeptical that the new body will help them find their missing relatives.
Pandiths in law tell us that in a democratic society, justice delayed is justice denied. On the other hand one should be aware that justice hurried could turn out to be justice miscarried or buried. Therefore, as in so many vital areas, a reasonable solution lies in the middle path or the unity of the opposites.
After so many agitations of the democratic mass movement, Parliament on Wednesday passed a bill to set up Special High Courts through which the government says it hopes to expedite cases involving large-scale bribery, corruption, fraud or other political crimes. Many believe political crimes are more important than corruption and fraud. In a market economy, society is constantly attacked by corruption and fraud, and illusion reigns. However politicians should be ethically sound and transparent.
The Judicature (Amendment) Bill was passed with amendments as recommended by the Supreme Court which had ruled that if those amendments were not made the passage of the bill would require a two-thirds majority which the coalition government may not be able to get because of the recent crossovers. In terms of the Act, permanent High Courts at Bar will be set up to try, hear and determine the trials of the offences specified in the Sixth Schedule of the Act. The Act is expected to expedite the judicial process of cases regarding serious frauds, corruption and other high profile crimes.
At the end of the British Empire, it controlled one fifth of the world and Anglo Saxons indirectly dominated the whole world. Under their reigns they introduced laws that to date criminalize same-sex conduct in 36 of the 53 countries in the Commonwealth, introducing centuries of Victorian values perpetuating homophobia that has been assimilated in to native cultures as their own values. Lanka is one example. Buddhism, the religion of the majority, directs to control desire in general but no specific restriction on gay or same sex behaviour.
Colonial era
However, during the 2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting the British Prime Minister, Theresa May said that the UK Government deeply regretted the anti-gay laws that were established by the British during the colonial era.
The damage caused by these outdated laws can never be undone. However the expression of deep regret is a necessary step for starting serious discussions to abolish these heinous laws and begin to mend the damage it has done in the past.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe often reminds being a part of the Commonwealth come the responsibility of upholding the Commonwealth values that are an integral part of what the Commonwealth community stands for.
Liberals say by signing the Commonwealth Charter, Lanka has committed to these values of equality and respect of all its citizens, which includes the LGBTIQ community. To be a part of the Commonwealth is to promote respect, tolerance, and understanding of our diverse communities. By understanding that this diversity adds to the advancement of the country rather than its downfall and by showing that all our citizens deserve to be treated with dignity and respect Lanka could lead the way. Unfortunately, dropping decriminalization from the National Human Rights action plan in January of 2017 is not the kind of action that instills confidence in the government that it stands for good governance and democracy and the protection of all its citizens sans none.
LGBTIQ community
Although it is commendable that the government has made certain strides towards the rights of its citizens, especially concerning Transgender persons, it is discouraging that it failed to exclude discrimination spawned by the Penal Code of 1883 that targets consensual same sex activities, failing to recognize Sexual Orientation as a basis for protection against discrimination. Despite the countless recommendations received by the UN, over the years and as recently as November 2017, the Sri Lankan government has neglected to acknowledge the LGBTIQ community as a marginalized group that needs protection and deserves the right to a free life, devoid of criminalization and discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.
Belize, Seychelles and Trinidad and Tobago serve as examples of progressive governments, who most recently, decriminalized homosexuality in their countries. But Lanka still fails to uphold the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Commonwealth Charter whereby all persons are born equal and will be treated equally and with dignity, free of discrimination.
Liberals must answer whether they at least stand for the Commonwealth values they have signed at the Commonwealth Joint Forum Plenary at CHOGM on April 17, 2018; As a family of nations, we must respect one anothers cultures and traditions. But we must do so in a manner consistent with our common value of equality, a value that is clearly stated in the Commonwealth charternobody should face persecution or discrimination because of whom they are or who they love.

Nadal bounces back from slow start to reach Rome semis
ROME May18: Rafael Nadal continued his clay domination on Friday, rallying from a set down to reach the Italian Open semi-finals with a 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory over Fabio Fognini.
The world number two needs to lift an eighth career title at the Foro Italico on Sunday to return to the top of the ATP rankings after losing that position to Roger Federer last week.
Spaniard Nadal dropped the opening set in an hour but re-grouped effortlessly as he swept past the Italian in the one-sided second and third sets of their quarter-final tie.
Im not used to playing so early, Nadal said of his midday start. But Im very happy to be in the semi-finals.
This was a very important win for me today. Nadal also beat Fognini in Rome in 2013 in their first ever meeting. This was his 11th victory in 14 meetings with the 21st-ranked Italian, and sixth in a row.
He is working towards Roland Garros, where he will aim for an unprecedented 11th title.
My clay court season has been, I think, fantastic. It will be much better if I finish here with another title, added the 16-time Grand Slam winner.
But I cant forget that I had five months without competing, from Shanghai (October 2017) until Monte-Carlo (last month). I didnt complete -- not one event.
The comeback has been great, I am happy with everything. It was the first time in four years that Nadal managed to win his quarter-final tie in Rome and next up he will face either fellow former world number one Novak Djokovic or Japans Kei Nishikori. Marin Cilic beat Pablo Carreno Busta 6-3, 6-3 to reach the Rome semi-finals for the first time in his career.
The Croatian fourth seed lost in the 2011 and 2017 quarter-finals at the Foro Italico, but dismissed Busta in 65 minutes.
Nadal and Cilic were joined as semi-finalist by womens fourth seed Elina Svitolina, who recovered from a slow start to defeat former world number one Angelique Kerber of Germany 6-4, 6-4.
I had to really step up and play really aggressive in important moments, Svitolina said. I think that was the key for today.
I played really good on the important points. Thats what made a difference.

Nestl Milo to send six football players to FC Barcelona
Six young talented Sri Lankan football players stand the chance to win an opportunity of a lifetime; attending an all-expense paid trip by Milo to a four-day football coaching camp run by FC Barcelona - the FC Barcelona Bara Academy (Soccer School). FC Barcelona is one of the leading professional football clubs in the world.
Milos aim is to nourish the ambitions of kids through their participation in sports, and encourage well rounded personalities. FC Barcelona prides itself on five principal values, namely: Humility, Effort, Ambition, Respect, and Teamwork.
Building on these shared values, Milo and FC Barcelona formed a four-year global partnership to promote healthier lifestyles and the importance of physical activity to young people. Together, they are developing a series of sports programs to encourage more young people to take part in sports.
Committed to developing school sports in Sri Lanka for more than three decades, Milo is leveraging this global agreement to help develop football in Sri Lanka as well as develop and inspire young football stars through its Road to Barcelona initiative.
Road to Barcelona will kick-off with an all-island U-12 Sri Lanka Schools Football Tournament, organised by the Sri Lanka Schools Football Association under the patronage of the Ministry of Education.
The tournament will be open to boys and girls born in 2007 and 2008. 250 girls teams and 800 boys teams will take part in the tournament, bringing the total number of participants to 12,600 children.
Based on the skills and values demonstrated at the tournament, the best children will be shortlisted to attend a selection camp, where an expert panel of coaches will select the most deserving six players to train in the FC Barcelona  Bara Academy.
Children not participating in the tournament will also have the chance to attend the selection camp by purchasing a 400g pack of Milo powder and SMSing a unique code (printed on the top flap) to 6456. More details can be found on the Milo Sri Lanka Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/MiloSriLanka). Milo has always been about fuelling the winning spirit of talented athletes in Sri Lanka, and promoting a healthy, active lifestyle among school children. Over the last 30 years, we have been continually raising the bar in supporting school-level sports and nurturing young athletes, many of whom have gone on to represent the country internationally. We are proud to now offer young Sri Lankan athletes training and development opportunities at a global level, said Norman Kannangara, Nestl vice president  Beverages.

Nine Years Later
One of the biggest mistakes made by post-independence rulers and politicians in Sri Lanka was trying to divide the population on the grounds of ethnicity and religion. They largely succeeded, which led to disastrous consequences for the entire country. The armed uprising in the North evolved into a terrorist movement that became one of the most violent in the world. The 30-year conflict marked one of the darkest chapters in our history, resulting in a massive loss of life and property. It also pushed back the countrys progress by an equivalent number of years.
It was the immense commitment and sacrifice of our Armed Forces that saw an end to the period of terror perpetrated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). They should live forever in the heart of every Sri Lankan. Their enemy was, in the words of the FBI, the most ruthless terrorist group in the world. As a nation, we should never forget those who sacrificed the prime of their youth and of course, their lives, for liberating the Nation from terrorism. Apart from those who died in combat, there are those who are still missing. There are those who lost their eyes, limbs and other organs. We have to be grateful to them for all time.
In the end, their efforts will be successful only if we have permanent peace. This cannot necessarily come from a triumphant attitude and a permanent war mentality. We must cast aside the war mentality at least now and embrace peace and reconciliation. The enemy combatants were our own brothers and sisters who were misguided by a megalomaniac and ruthless leader into carrying out various acts of terror in the name of liberation. This was indeed the point made by Minister Rajitha Senaratne a few days ago.
This is indeed why the State has rehabilitated thousands of former Tiger combatants and turned them into useful citizens. Some former LTTE cadres have already joined the Armed Forces after their rehabilitation. There were also stories of soldiers marrying former LTTE women cadres. If the combatants themselves can forget the past and become firm friends and even partners for life, why cannot others do the same
They say that the past is a different country. Those does not mean that we should forget the past, but rather that we should live in the present and embrace the future. It is essential that we come to terms with what happened in the conflict. The Government has rightly taken action in this regard, with measures such as the inception of the Office of Missing Persons. Being a member of the UN and the International Community, we have to adhere to International Humanitarian Laws and Human Rights norms. On its part, the Government has reassured the International Community that there will be a domestic accountability mechanism and the Army too has set up a directorate to probe whether there were any untoward incidents especially in the final days of the conflict. Both the President and the Prime Minister have also assured that there will be no persecution of war heroes.
Even more importantly, we should examine how we got to the battlefield in the first place, pitting brother against brother. We, or rather our politicians, made a series of serious mistakes that led to this situation. We have to learn from such experiences so that a conflict may never ever arise again in or country. This is part of the healing and reconciliation process. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) recommended a series of steps that should be taken to foster harmony among the various communities. Although the LLRC was appointed by the previous regime, it made little or no effort to implement its recommendations. This Government has implemented most of its recommendations.
But the biggest initiative is formulating an all-new Constitution that takes into account the changing post-conflict needs and aspirations. The final aim of the new Constitution should be enabling an environment to create a truly Sri Lankan identity. Even in official forms and documents, we are still asked what our race (ethnicity) is. Clearly, we have not learned any hard lessons even after a 30-year war that tore us apart. Indeed, there are politicians and others on both sides who still thrive on inflaming ethnic passions. Extremist Tamil politicians and sections of the Diaspora must realise that a separate state for a particular community is not realistic at all and extremist Sinhala politicians and hardline groups must realise that devolution of power is the only path to a lasting solution.
We have a generation that knows nothing but war. However, having gone through and suffered from the horrors of conflict, they will not want to be part of it again. We have a generation born just before and after the conclusion of hostilities who know nothing about the brutality of strife. It is these two generations that we must protect and veer away from any thoughts of conflict. Together, these two generations have the power to take Sri Lanka to greater heights sans any thoughts of animosity against one another.

She told the media that the total allocated to refurbish the Mayors official residence was Rs 5.2 million.
Senanayake said the Archeological Department had conducted a research on buildings within Colombo, especially around the Town Hall and the Mayors official residence was also identified as one of the old buildings that needs to be refurbished.
I do not have any intentions to waste tax payers money for such purposes like modernising toilets.
The Mayors house is a public property and that is one of the old buildings that should be protected, she said. She further said that initiatives are being taken to make all transactions done by Colombo Municipal Council online.
I have a huge house with seven rooms and eight bathrooms. I am not a person who thinks of stealing or wasting peoples money, she said. Senanayake noted that there are many problems that need immediate solutions like garbage disposal and flooding in several parts of Colombo.
The CMC has already identified several areas in Colombo that get flooded even for small rains. The CMC with World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) funding will soon rectify those issues, she said.
She further said that first stage of that project has already started and they are looking for grants to begin the second stage of the project. Deputy Municipal Commissioner K.A. D. N.Wickramarathna said that CMC gets 48 percent of the revenue share from fines levied and 40 percent from parking charges.

President tells CC: continuing in Govt.weakens SLFP
President Maithripala Sirisena told the SLFP Central Committee (CC) to fix the date as to when the SLFP will quit the Government, SLFP Opposition MP Dayasiri Jayasekara said.
Addressing a press conference at the Centre of Media for the Freedom in Punchi Borella yesterday, Jayasekara said the President told the CC that continuing in the Government any longer would only result in the weakening of the SLFP and further distancing itself from the people.
The President asked the CC to take a correct decision. The SLFP members in the Government are also holding discussions in this regard. Our group of 16 in the Opposition has stressed that the SLFP should leave the Government, and the SLFP members who want to remain in the Government can do so individually, he said.
MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said the President told the CC that remaining in the Government would only ruin the SLFPs future.
He however stressed that the President made these comments at the CC as the SLFP Chairman and not as the Head of State.
As the Head of State he has to rule the country. But he made those remarks as our party leader,Abeywardena he said.
Former Minister Jayasekara further said a new set of office bearers will be appointed to the SLFP for an interim period at a special SLFP Central Committee (CC) meeting on June 3.
He said the CC, Executive Committee and the All Island Committee will meet on June 3 to agree on a complete restructure of the party.
The President obtained in writing the views of the Group of 16 in the Opposition and the Group of 23 in the Government, and he combined them and presented to the CC. Far-reaching party reforms will be presented to District level committees on June 9-10, and village level committees on June 14-15.
The process will be completed by August 26 and the President will announce the permanent office bearers of the party at the SLFP Convention on September 2. He will also brief the partys programme to come back to power, he added.

The Ministry plans to purchase 7,000 metric tonnes of seed onion from local farmers as a relief for them considering the difficulties faced by many farmers since they cannot get a good price for their produce. The Ministry has taken measures to provide more reliefs for the farmers who engage in big onion farming.
The Ministry has decided to provide a seed subsidy of Rs. 9,000 per an acre, an insurance cover worth Rs. 40,000 and fertiliser subsidy for the big onion farmers.

SLAITO calls to automate immigration processes
Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) President Harith Perera said Sri Lanka should move faster on adopting automated immigration systems.
He stressed the need for better management of systems and processes at the Katunayake Bandaranaike International Airport.
It is a widely held perception among all our industry stakeholders that the BIA should be managed more efficiently minimizing delays and waiting times. Delays during the immigration process at the entry point is a major concern on the part of tourists arriving on the island. The best way to address this is to move faster on automation, Perera said.
Many countries have already taken this path to expedite their immigration processes, he said.
He said that manual immigration systems are fast becoming obsolete in the global context.
Without thinking of employing more people to man the immigration desks at our international airports, we must employ more machines. This should be complemented with a comprehensive border security system like in Australia and Canada. In some countries, even the Customs operations have been incorporated into their border management systems, he said.
The SLAITO President said infrastructure developments of this sort will immensely benefit the countrys tourism industry which is on an ambitious three-year mission to double its revenue and employment generation.
It is true that the tourism numbers are increasing. At the same time, there must be robust systems to ensure that entry points do not become a bottleneck. We must soon come to the realization that the development of the tourism sector must go hand in hand with the development of entry points, he warned adding that such issues, if unaddressed, would cripple the tourism industry in the long run.
He pointed out that the airport and aviation sector of Sri Lanka must adopt a strategic plan  a roadmap similar to the three-year Tourism Strategic Plan (TSP 2017-2020) endorsed by the Cabinet  that gives a clear vision to develop its infrastructure.
In addition to automation of immigration, this must also address issues like poor traffic management at the arrival and departure terminals of the BIA. It must outline action items to develop the airport and aviation sector allowing it to meet the demands of our industries, he said.

Sri Lankas cycling legend Trevor de Silva
Some sporting records are broken within minutes while others stand for decades. When a record stays unbroken for over five decades, it has to be very special. This is the Asian Games cycling record of former St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa and St. Josephs College, Colombo cyclist Trevor de Silva presently domiciled in England. It was back in 1966 that he won two bronze medals in Bangkok. Many in the cycling world believe that this achievement is so far ahead of its time, that it might stand for many more years and some think that it might never be broken.
Trevors cycling career started as a schoolboy when he won the National Championships and was selected to represent Sri Lanka when he was just 17 years old. He went on to win several prestigious races and at the age of 21 was the first rider to win the three major tours - Lake House sponsored Tour de Lanka and Tour of the Hills, and the Tour of the Valley all within twelve months. Trevor migrated to the UK in 1969 where he qualified as a Chartered Engineer and then a Masters in Business Administration.
Trevor trained about 800km a week for three years before the Asian Games. He had excellent training partners such as the late great Maurice Coomaravel (his mentor), Trevor Newman, Jeffrey Mason, Desmond Goonewardena, and his other Asian Games team mates Ivan Gamage and Mike Hassan. Trevor believed in training smarter. He trained twice a day every day. Sometimes he trained three times a day. Each training ride had a specific aim: His main endurance ride was over 200km which he did once a week. His strength training was a combination of on the bike and off the bike. To improve his aerobic capacity he rode behind a moped for one hour at 50kph. His general speed work was with Maurice Coomaravel. His sprint training was behind Coomaravels motor bike up to 80kph. Trevors greatest asset was his self belief. He always believed he could win an Asian Games medal. Winning national races was secondary to self improvement.
In his own words To win a race, I only had to beat the rider who was second. To win a medal, I had to keep beating myself. That is exactly what he did. Every year for three years getting better, faster and stronger.
Trevor was an automatic choice for the Asian Games in Bangkok in 1966. After the heats and semi-finals, six world class Asian cyclists, including an Olympic medallist, lined up for the final. There was also Sri Lankas star rider 24 year old Trevor de Silva. At the start the cyclists were picking up speed and doing about 50kph. There was a touch of wheels and a rider in front of Trevor crashed to the ground. His cycle bounced off the ground and hit Trevor around the upper body cracking his collar bone and badly injuring his hand. While the other rider was taken to the medical centre, Trevor quickly remounted and after furious chase won Sri Lankas first ever medal in international cycling. A few days later and heavily bandaged and right hand strapped to the handlebars and displaying unbelievable courage and grim determination Trevor won a second bronze medal. The last Sri Lankan medal for over half a century! Two of our former Lake House colleagues witnessed this great event - the late Carlton Seneviratne and late Leslie Fernando they were of the view that if not for this accident Trevor would have won the Gold medal.
In 1971 Trevor was selected for the Munich Olympics 1972 having achieved 3hrs 58min for the 160km Road Race and 52min for the 40km Time Trial. But by early 1972 he had lost the passion for the hard training and he had other plans such as to go into coaching. His chance of winning an Olympic medal with only 500km a week of training was slim, so he withdrew from the team. In 2008 de Silva and Coomaravel received prestigious National Sporting Awards at the BMICH. They are also featured in the unique book, Sri Lanka Proud - A Tribute to Champions. In 2014 Trevor and his wife Anne were invited by the Sri Lankan government to the grand opening of the new National Sports Centre where he received a Gold Medal from the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for a life time achievement, the highest civilian honour in the country.
At the age of 75, Trevor is still passionate about coaching and training. He is a UK Athletics Level 4 Performance Coach. Trevor and his wife Anne run a small sports training business called ExecFit Training Academy focusing on Running, Cycling and Fitness. Trevors main function is structuring Personalised Training Plans for runners and cyclists. This includes advice on Nutrition and Injury Prevention though Core Strength and Sports Conditioning. He still applies his Smarter Training principles with great success. The Running Academy has been based at the Maiden Centre in New Maiden since 1987. ExecFit Training caters for beginners as well as the more experienced. They have several national level runners and two overseas marathon runners who hope to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics. Anne, also a qualified running coach runs Fitness and Walking groups. Trevor has weekly run training sessions for Hercules Wimbledon AC and Wimbledon Windmilers Running Club. ExecFit Training has a new scheme to develop young runners from about eighteen years. They will be directed and guided over a two to six year development cycle to reach a National UK standard or higher. They are hoping to have a squad of three men and three women.

Sri Lanka - Singapore FTA to protect job market
The countrys job market will not be opened to foreigners and no professional in the country will face any injustice due to the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister at a meeting with representatives of the Sri Lanka Institution of Engineers and Sri Lanka Institute of Architects at Temple Trees yesterday said no professional in the country will be deprived of job opportunities under this Agreement.
It was decided to have continuous discussions with various professionals to resolve issues and misunderstandings on the FTA with Singapore.
The Prime Minister requested that he be informed on problematic areas of the Agreement and its Appendices, so that the truth can be explained.
The representatives also agreed to actively take part in monitoring the implementation of the Agreement. It was emphasized that there is room to revise the Agreement at the end of each term. Strategic Development and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama explained that the aim of the FTA with Singapore is to attract foreign investments, to create overseas job opportunities for Sri Lankans and to facilitate joint business partnerships between Sri Lankan companies and other global companies.
Secretary to Prime Minister Saman Ekanayaka, Strategic Development and International Trade Ministry Secretary Chandani Wijewardena, Emigration and Immigration Controller General M.N. Ranasinghe and Finance and Mass Media Ministry and Attorney Generals Department officials also attended the meeting.

Stokes makes low-key exit after IPL struggles
New Delhi, Friday: Ben Stokes cost the Rajasthan Royals $10,000 for every Indian Premier League run he managed this year, making him a luxury even by the opulent league's standards.
Stokes, under pressure over a looming court case for a street fight, was voted the IPL's Most Valuable Player last year and was the top foreign signing for 2018 with a $1.96 million deal.
But he left India this week having scored just 196 runs in 13 games.
By contrast New Zealander Kane Williamson, captain of table-topper Sunrisers Hyderabad, has bashed his 625 runs so far for less than $725 each. And he is still going strong.
Many commentators believe England star Stokes' off-field troubles have blunted his performance on the pitch.
"Ben Stokes hasn't been that aggressive in-your-face cricketer in this tournament due to what's happened," said former New Zealand all-rounder Scott Styris.
"And part of that reason I think is because he has to keep a low profile. That's not his personality," Styris told AFP on the sidelines of his Star Sports show Select Dugout.

There are limitations in providing information- Army Commander
The Army is a very structured organisation that is commanded by one person. It should be the way and the army commander should not let anyone else command the army, Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake said.
In an interview with the Daily News, he noted that, If there are allegations that there are small groups operating separately, its very unlikely. We discuss with other agencies such as the SIS and the STF. But it has to be centrally controlled. Decentralised execution is accepted but it should be centrally controlled. There are 22 Divisions and over 270 Brigades and there is also the Commando, Special Forces and other independent brigades which are controlled only by me. Even if officers under me handled administration activities, at the end of the day, I as the Commander is responsible. Even if a soldier commits a wrong even while on leave, its my responsibility. It is also my responsibility to ensure that they go out of the army as well. I will discharge them.
In terms of disappearances and allegations that the army is not cooperating with investigations, he said if anyone is alleging that the army is not supporting these investigations, the commander denied these allegations, adding that it is not the case. It is the investigators who are supposed to carry out the investigations. I always say that there is a big difference between a war hero and a murderer. Even today, there are over 20 military personnel in jail for committing wrongs during combat. But when investigators request for documents or evidence that is not available, no army commander can provide such information.For example there are log books maintained on troop movement. However,movements of the camps commanding officer, are not logged. In the case of intelligence documents, they are a closed group and even I will have to ask them for any information I need. Their records are not backed up anywhere, but within their group. Even telephone numbers are taken on various other names for intelligence and national security, he said, adding that there are limitations in how much information even he as the commander can provide.

## Title: Timber of corruption and blare of SLFP divisions

Timber of corruption and blare of SLFP divisions
For a government with a declared commitment to fighting corruption, the recent developments, especially with regard to the State Timber Corporation, are in no way supportive of its anti-corruption pledges and responsibilities. There are two former chairmen of the State Timber Corporation, now in remand prison, which does not speak of any teak wood strength in fighting corruption, but that of very weak timber.
The new remandee is former JVP MP Anuruddha Polgampola, who was appointed chairman of the Timber Corporation after the arrest and judicial detention of its former chairman, P. Dissanayake. Polgampola, a former JVP member, later a supporter of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and still later, current President Maithripala Sirisena, was appointed chairman of the Timber Corporation after its previous head was swiftly interdicted, following his involvement in the huge corruption scandal of the former Chief of Staff of the Presidents Office. The issue here is that Polgampola succeeding Dissanayake was due to an appointment by the President. He too was removed from that office no sooner the allegations about his corrupt activities involving immigration went public. Very timely indeed. But it is now known he was involved in a serious case of corruption, before the Courts, and had avoided the Courts on two occasions.
What is most regrettable here is that amidst policy declarations of fighting corruption, the current situations are pointing fingers at the President, who is the Head of State and Government, giving ample opportunities for critics of both him and the government to make charges on the lack of a serious commitment to fight corruption, and even worse that this government is closely associated with the corrupt. If you look at the longer record, it is seen that three successive Chiefs of Staff of the Presidents Office  under three presidents - have been remanded for alleged corruption charges. It seems a continuing record of corruption, which certainly needs a stronger fight. What is of more importance now is to make sure that the Office of the President, pays more and serious attention to knowing the background of people who are recommended or seek important appointments in the State sector; and bring the necessary information to the notice of the President, before any appointments are made. The background checks on appointees to higher positions than routine office and management duties, should be certainly deeper, sharper and swifter, to prevent the President from making such appointments, that could be disastrous to the image of the government and its leadership.
SLFP clamour
Being part of the government, part of the Joint Opposition and independents in the Opposition benches, has led to a cacophony of demands by the new SLFP independent group. The Central Committee of the SLFP will begin discussions on party reforms this week. The 16 member independent group has tabled a proposal for the SLFP to leave the unity government and be part of the Opposition, which their own members know will not be decided very soon, as S. B. Dissanayake has told the Daily Mirror this week. They are keen to get the other members of the party, still in the government, and holding ministerial office too, to quit with speed and join their ranks in the Opposition benches. But, this too seems a lot of noise just now, with little signs of realization.
The SLFPs dissonance has much to do with the next presidential election and the candidate for the Executive Presidency. The Opposition Bench 16 remain supportive of President Sirisena being the SLFPs candidate of the next presidential poll. It is certainly difficult for them to say anything else, especially after President Sirisena said he does not intend to retire from politics by 2020.
Their major concern is to bring about unity within the party, which they see as a necessity to bring about a left wing progressive presidency, or such a candidacy, at the next presidential poll. They certainly see the strength of the SLPP led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, but are worried by the divisions within the party, especially the absence of support from Maithripala Sirisena, which may not give it the majority of the Sinhala votes the party needs, for a presidential victory. A key part of their campaigning is to overcome the differences between President Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa, for a stronger and wider unity, not yet an easy task.
Sibling saga
They are aware of the huge victory the SLPP and Mahinda Rajapaksa obtained at the February 10 Local Government Poll. But, also aware that it would not be repeated in the next presidential poll because Mahinda Rajapaksa will not be a candidate, prevented by law from seeking another presidential term.
The increasing babble within the SLFP has much to do with the choice of the next presidential candidate - and especially which sibling of Mahinda Rajapaksa it will be  Gotabhaya, Basil or Chamal. Gotabhaya, the former Secretary of Defence, did make a strong case in the recent Viyathmaga Convention at the Shangri-la, where a near manifesto of the next presidential poll was presented, under the theme  An Intellectually Inspired Sri Lanka. Intellectual inspiration or not, the draw remains his role in the defeat of the LTTE. There are concerns whether he would be able to last the non-arrest capability for as long as the next presidential poll by 2020.
Basil, who is mainly responsible for the organisation of the SLPP  Pohottuva, is seen as a distant call, with questionable issues of popularity. Chamal, the elder of the three, has an increasing following among the SLFP organisers and the allied parties of the Joint Opposition, due to his quiet nature and the absence of any allegations of corruption. The SLFP will certainly move into more and stronger debate over the candidate, with background doubts about the consequences of the possible candidacy of Maithripala Sirisena, although considered very much in the doubt. A party that has moved very much from the policies of its founder SWRD Bandaranaike, still has voices that seek a left wing progressive policies, underscored by opposition to the UNP, World Bank, IMF, the Western world, and free market economics. In the continuing contentions within the party, are increasing voices of concern about family dominance. They do not oppose the Mahinda Rajapaksa leadership, but the possibility of a sibling being Executive President, when he is prime minister, as widely expected, does raise issues, whether such family dominance would be acceptable to the voters, especially with a Viyathmaga package. There are also quiet expressions that Mahinda Rajapaksa himself may not be too happy with such a situation, in the context of the constitutional controls of the 19th Amendment.
The SLFP will certainly move on to wider and deeper debate on the politics and personalities of the executive presidency in the coming weeks.
Issue of 19A
As the discussion over the JVPs proposal to bring in a 20th Amendment to the Constitution moves on, with increasing doubts about the ability to obtain a two-thirds majority, after the 16 SLFPers went to opposition benches, there are also increasing discussions, especially among SLFP and SLPP politicians and strategists of the need to do away with the 19th Amendment. SB Dissanayake has in fact accused Jayampathy Wickremaratne, who is involved with the constitutional amendments process, of being supportive of a dictatorial Prime Minister through the 19A.
The issue here is the necessity for clear unity between the SLFP and SLPP, or the coming together of both parties, at the next General Election in 2020, to get a sufficiently large majority in Parliament, to do away with 19A. Some strategists and academics supportive of doing away with the policies of January 2015, see in such a majority, the possibility to remove the two term limit for the Executive President, go back to the Mahinda Rajapaksas 18th Amendment, and even give bigger and wider powers to the Executive President, leading to a major shift in the political process in the country. The concern of those who are thinking of making this a rallying call in the next presidential poll, is the need for minority votes in substantial numbers to have such an amendment adopted. Current trends show that a majority Sinhala-Buddhist vote alone would not see the success of such a move. But, some of the strategists and academics do think that if situations with regard to ethnic relations could be moved away from the polices or talk of reconciliation, and more keener differences with the minorities encouraged, it could lead to a situation where a bigger Sinhala-Buddhist support could be obtained to carry out the necessary constitutional changes.
The differences within the SLFP, and the not so concealed differences within the UNP, with questions of leadership and party organisational changes gaining importance in both parties, the political planning and debates are fast moving to the next presidential election, with the possibility of constitutional changes that may take the country back from 2015 and not forward from 2020.

War Dead in North were not from Tamil Nadu, they were Sri Lankans: Rajitha
Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne <U+200B>on Wednesday said the government would take a neutral stance with regard to commemoration activities in the North on May 18.
The following are excerpts of the discussion held at the Cabinet media briefing with regard to the governments stance on letting the North mourn the dead.
Journalist: Minister, a Northern Provincial Council member has suggested that May 18 be declared as a day of mourning. What is the governments stance on that
Rajitha Senaratne (RS): We have no problem. All these years the JVP celebrated the deaths of their comrades Viru samaruwa or something
Journalist: But how can they say that it is a national day of mourning
RS: The people died in the North were not from Tamil Nadu; they were our own people. Our children were killed and in the other side too, our children were killed. It was a civil war, not a foreign invasion.
Journalist: The LTTE was a terrorist organization. They have been proscribed thus.
RS: What was the JVP then Was it not also proscribed as a terrorist organization Though the people who were killed were terrorists to us, they were parents, children, siblings and spouses of those people.
Journalist: The government had declared National Ranawiru Day to commemorate My 18. And lamps were lit on behalf of fallen soldiers and we commemorate them. Now when the people of the North do this, what do we in the South do
RS: Though we say we are commemorating our soldiers (heroes), what are we celebrating Those killed were also our children. And that is why we are to bring about reconciliation.
Journalist: The soldiers killed terrorists.
RS: Were only terrorists killed during the war
Journalist: Are you saying that other people were also killed
RS: There is no war without casualties. Everyone knows that. In 1988, were only JVP rebels killed Were not innocents killed then
Journalist: The JVP is not like the LTTE. The LTTE is an international terrorist organization
RS: Could you please tell me the difference between what Prabhakaran and Wijeweera did Tell me the difference in the atrocities they committed Tell me which one was right and what was wrong
Journalist: I would like to ask the military spokesperson, at a time when we have war crime allegations against the army, are you saying that the army killed civilians
RS: No officer in the army will tell you that no civilian was killed during the war. No army in the world will tell you that. It is war.
Journalist; I want to ask the military spokesperson.
RS: Can you tell me whether there is any war in the world where civilians were not killed
Journalist: Is it right that you say this when we have an international investigation against us
RS: The investigation is against extra judicial killings and what I am saying is different. A war will have casualties.
Journalist: Military Spokesperson, do you accept the governments stance
Military Spokesperson: I dont want to go into a confrontation here. I dont think the Minister was implying anything against the armed forces and what I got from him was that during certain incidents in a war, casualties can happen.
RS: The war was fought against terrorism, not against the Tamils, please remember that. I have always maintained this stance.
Journalist: What I am saying is that when they commemorate their dead, does that not mean that they are commemorating the very people who killed our people in the South
RS: That is exactly what the JVP does. The JVP says that in 1988 they had a genocide, similarly in the North, they say genocide happened. These are just different perspectives.
Journalist: The incumbent government stopped the celebration of Victory Day, they made that decision on principle saying that if we celebrate that, it would be like celebrating the deaths of thousands. But they are now having a day of mourning..
RS: Who is they
Journalist: The Northern Provincial Council. Will the government let them do that
RS: They have not done much development work, so they keep passing these resolutions. They are not to be taken seriously. Like lowly politicians in the South, they use things to win some votes. Even the TNA has fallen out with the NPC Chief Minister.
When politicians go bankrupt, the weapons they take to hand are race and religion.
Journalist: They are saying that they are going to rename roads after fallen LTTE leaders
RS: The TNA will not let that happen.

Wildlife experts decry human-wildlife conflict
The media and public should refrain from calling altercations between people and wild animals a conflict, wildlife experts said at a workshop on Thursday.
There needs to be a shift in the way people think about the human-wildlife conflict in Sri Lanka, former Director General of the Department of Wildlife Conservation Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya said.
He was speaking at the Sri Lanka Press Institute. According to him, between 50 and 70 people are killed by elephants every year in Sri Lanka. Humans in turn kill between 250 and 270 elephants a year.
He said it is important how the media reports these stories, because it shapes how the public thinks about wildlife.
He gave the example of a recent incident in Tabbowa where two people died after hitting an elephant with their vehicle. The media reported the event as an elephant attack, he said. But it was a car accident.
He cited data that 70 percent of men who are killed by elephants are found to be under the influence of liquor, leading them into risk-taking behaviors.
He noted that people living in purana gamas rarely have deadly confrontations with wildlife.
Prevention is the best form of mitigation, he said.
Dr. Vidya Athreya, a scientist show studies leopard-human interactions in Mumbai, concurred.
Historically, our ancient civilizations have lived with these animals, she said.
She said scientists and the media must work to change the minds of people, rather than the dynamics of animals.

Without Italy, it just doesnt feel like a World Cup: Dino Zoff
When Italy clinched World Cup victory in 1982 their superstar goalkeeper Dino Zoff became the oldest player ever to lift the trophy at the age of 40.
In an interview, Zoff tells AFP how he is planning on watching this year's World Cup, which he says without Italy just doesn't feel like the real deal.
Q: How did you feel when Italy lost to Sweden in the World Cup qualifiers
A: "I was at home with my family. And it was hard, of course, Italy hadn't missed out on a World Cup for 60 years. When you look at the teams that qualified, some do not have our trophies, our history. Having been in the national team for so long, it hurts. It's not normal for Italy to have to watch a World Cup from the sidelines. It just doesn't feel like a World Cup. People in Italy are very attached to football and they will still follow it. But it might be tough to watch a little-known side play while our team, which has carved its name into footballing history with four World Cup titles, stays at home."
Q: What does the World Cup mean to you
A: "For me there is nothing greater, it's everything, pure joy. To reach the highest heights of your profession, at the age of 40 and as team captain, was just a rush of happiness. It was the highlight of my career because the World Cup is the highlight of football."
Q: Italy is down at number 20 in the FIFA rankings, how do you feel about that
A: "Out of the World Cup, down at 20 in the rankings... I don't like talking about my era, but we were always among the best. It's a bad sign for Italian football"
Q: But at club level your teams play well...
A: "Yes but with a lot of foreign players. We must rebuild our national team and we do have some young talent, even if there are not that many of them. A generation of players is winding down and we must start believing in our future potential. In 2006, Italy won the World Cup by the skin of its teeth. But it was a great generation of footballers. When I was coach, I also oversaw a great generation in 2000: we almost won the Euros. Now we must wait and work on our young players, as they are our future."
Q: We often hear how Italy is obsessed with tactics, and that the young players don't work enough on technique...
A: "I don't like fundamentalism. Technique, tactics, physical fitness, you have to develop all that in young players. But above all, up to a certain age, they must be allowed to be free. Sometimes you get the impression that these young footballers are being raised like chickens in a battery farm. A child needs space to develop, not to be tied down with strict rules. We should make them play more, including at school. But, nowadays, how many times a week can a child go to football training Once, twice There are classes, English lessons, all that. It's a lot harder than it was before."
Q: So do you think that the situation has changed since your era
A: "We weren't better and we didn't work differently but the conditions were more favourable. You can't just let a child go and play alone in the garden or in the street for hours anymore. And you can't compare three hours of football training a week to seven, 14 or even 21... in my day we played eight hours a day, from 1pm until dinner."
Q: Is it a structural problem
A: "We have the structures but we have fewer players. In my region (Friuli-Venezia Giulia in north-eastern Italy), each village had a team. Now they have to group the villages together to make a team. There are fewer children being born, fewer players and more opportunities to play other sports."
Q: But is the status of football under threat
A: "Italy is a footballing nation, because we have a strong tradition. It is deeply-rooted, we have won World Cups, Euros. It's a simple, people's game, all the characteristics that keep it the sport that counts."  AFP

The workshop that makes eliminated Italy home of the World Cup
When the World Cup is held aloft in July, it won't be an Italian lifting the trophy. The eliminated Azzurri will not brighten the tournament, but Italians will still make the cup shine.
The four-time winners' humiliating exit in November's playoff defeat to Sweden cast a pall over one of the world's proudest football nations.
Italy are not going to the World Cup, but the World Cup will come to Italy.
Every four years, in an anonymous building in an industrial town near Milan, amid the clouds of metal dust and sound of presses and hammers, an Italian company gets its hands on the World Cup trophy itself -- and gives it a makeover. GDE Bertoni, a small business with 12 employees based in the Milanese suburb of Paderno Dugnano, designed and created the current cup in 1971 after Brazil kept the Jules Rimet trophy after they won the World Cup for the third time, and every four years it returned home for a spruce up.
"It's always a special feeling when the original trophy comes back to us, even if we see the replica every day," says Valentina Losa, director of the company her great-grandfather founded in 1938.
The trophy was made by the company's then-artistic director, sculptor Silvio Gazzaniga, helped by Valentina's father Giorgio, who suggested the globe at the top of the trophy.
"The original is the original. It's like the difference between seeing the original Mona Lisa or a copy. It's not the same feeling at all."
AMAZING FEELING
Standing in front of an autographed photo of Franz Beckenbauer, who in 1974 became the first captain to lift the new trophy, Losa recounts how her company bagged the contract.
"There were 53 proposals from all over the world, but we were the only ones to have made a model, a physical product," she says. "Having it in front of you, not just a drawing -- that plays."
Soon after every World Cup, FIFA sends the trophy, which is 38 centimetres long and contains more than six kilos of solid gold and malachite, home to be tended to. "For four years it travels, and is exposed to the elements. It's a little damaged, but we put it back into shape," says Pietro Brambilla, one of the Bertoni workshop's eight specialist workers. Brambilla has no interest in football but something changes when he sees the World Cup winning captain lift the trophy.
"I always shed a tear at that moment because that trophy passed through my hands. It's an amazing feeling," he says.
"Not many people can say that they've held the World Cup."
COVETED
As well as making the original, Bortoni is also responsible for making a replica which the eventual winners of each tournament get to keep.
The replica is made from brass, after which is undergoes a range of treatments including milling and polishing before being bathed in 24-carat gold.
"We do this by eye. Once we see that she is beautiful, it comes out," says Ahmed Ait Siti Abdelkader, depositing a varnish that will keep the trophy shiny for about a decade.
"The World Cup is something different," he adds. "We make a lot of cups here, for Africa, the Gulf, Europe, Central America ... but this one has an extraordinary effect on you, different from all the others."
On July 15 Neymar, Lionel Messi, Hugo Lloris, Sergio Ramos or Manuel Neuer could be lifting the trophy rather than Italy captain Gianluigi Buffon, whose post-elimination tears captured a nation's heart in November. But a few months later it will come home again to an industrial corner of Italy for its regular once over.
"It's such a coveted trophy that when a team wins it, the players mess around with it and take advantage of it -- a bit too much," says Losa. "Sometimes it comes back with a bit of work to do. Let's just say that in 2006 the Italians really partied."  AFP
