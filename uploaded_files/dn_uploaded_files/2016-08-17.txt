MR using JO as cover up for his misconduct: UNP MP
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is attempting to cover up financial and other alleged misconduct carried out by him and his family members during his regime, using the Joint Opposition, UNP Parliamentarian Heshan Withanage said.
He said it was humorous that the Joint Opposition (JO) was making baseless allegations that the government was taking political revenge when legal action was taken against persons responsible for various misconducts during the last regime.
Withanage made these comments at a press briefing at Sirikotha yesterday.
The MP said unlike the period of Mahinda Rajapaksa, the law of the country is followed to the letter.
He said when legal action is taken against persons for malpractices, especially persons representing the JO, it is categorised as political revenge.
The people are aware how the country was governed. However, under the good governance government, the law is equal and positions of persons are not considered. It is clear that Namal Rajapaksa was arrested over an investigation under the Money Laundering Act. But the JO levels allegations that the arrest as political revenge, he said.
Withanage said during the previous regime, there was no accountability with regard to public money.
Public money was misused and mismanaged as the then rulers wanted, he said.
UNP Parliamentarian Sandith Samarasinghe said he was not satisfied with police investigations into an incident where the bodies of two female elephants used for safari, were exhumed.
He said the two elephants died due to inhuman treatment by the mahouts.
It has been reported that a team had tried to get the bodies after exhuming. This is an illegal act because the owner of any elephant is the state even though that particular elephant belonged to a private owner, Samarasinghe said.
Police has not taken action against these persons yet. Persons responsible for the incident have been identified as supporters of former President Rajapaksa and a Chief Minister, he said.

January 8 change freed politicised public service: Minister Madduma Bandara
The era that took hold of the public service as well as public servants brought to an end by the January 8 change, said Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
He said public servants were the pioneers to bring about change identifying the biggest impact on the country by the politicisation of the public service.
Minister Bandara said the main objective of the January 8 change was to establish democracy in the country.
He made these observations at the 2016 Convocation of the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration (SLIDA) at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) yesterday.
About 159 students obtained their Master of Public Management (MPM) and Postgraduate Diploma in Public Management (PGDPM). They included nine MPM graduands with merit pass and another nine PGDMP graduands.
Minister Bandara said education plays a pivotal role in developing a country. The previous government had allocated only 1.8 percent of the GDP to education while this government allocated six percent of the GDP.
The people would be able to reap the benefits of these moves in future," Minister Bandara said.
Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella was also present.

SLFP Local Government Representatives Collective to boycott National Convention
The SLFP Local Government Representatives Collective declared that they would boycott the SLFP National Convention scheduled to be held in Kurunegala.
They also stated that whilst they would continue to be members of the SLFP, the single minded decisions taken by the President and General Secretary of the party had forced them to take such a stance. They also requested that all SLFP MPs of the Joint Opposition too refrain from attending the convention.
The collective which is made up of former chairmen and members of Local Governments in Kantale, Trincomalee, Seruwavila and Polonnaruwa held their media briefing yesterday at former President Mahinda Rajapaksas office at Battramulla.
They also said that they would take steps to stand against the injustice meted out by the party leaders against party members. They pointed out that the leadership had chosen to enter into an agreement with the UNP for the next five years without having consulted party members or the party's Central Committee. The Collective stressed that the true members of the party were opposed to this.
The Collective also opined that the SLFP ministers in government were acting in accordance with the wishes of the UNP, and they (Collective) did not accept the authority of the incumbent General Secretary and that President Sirisena would go down in history as a leader who insulted the party and betrayed it to the UNP.
They also praised the actions of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who they acknowledged to be a leader who won the war and never betrayed the party.
They stressed that Rajapaksa had always been a strength to the party and that they would continue to support him.
The Collective also added that if the supporters were fed up with the incumbent leadership of the party, there was no point in them participating in the upcoming Convention.
