Fake news campaign to discredit ministers  Rajitha Senaratne
An organised campaign of manufacturing fake news was being carried out to discredit the ministers, Co-Cabinet spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
The minister made this remark at the weekly Cabinet briefing held yesterday at the Government Information Department.
Senaratne was responding to allegations that Co-cabinet spokesman Minister Gayantha Karunathilake was distributing bananas with his picture and name among flood victims. We have found out who is orchestrating all this. It is a secretary of a son of a famous family who is responsible for creating such fake news. This secretary has been asked to launch campaigns every day to discredit the government," Minister Senaratne said.
He said the Secretary had established a centre with computers and around 40 staff members to work on this campaign.
This time, they happen to choose bananas to do the job," he said.
Meanwhile, Minister Karunathilake denied rumours that he was branding flood relief items and said he had submitted a written complaint to the CID to investigate into the matter.
In the midst of the floods, there has been certain political activity and an organised attempt to discredit me.
Those who are from my district know that I would never do such a thing, but people outside and abroad have believed such propaganda," he said.
He said this incident was being used not only to attack him but also the government. The minister had given a statement to the CID in this regard on Tuesday.

Abolishing cess will destroy local industries - Ven Rathana Thera
Abolishing the cess on imports will destroy local industries in the country, MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said.
Our dream of doing good deeds with this Government have been shattered and the only thing left now is preventing it from engaging in more harm to the country, Ven.Rathana Thera said yesterday.
Addressing a press conference held in Colombo yesterday he said that if this political change done by him and others harm the country and the people, there is no point of being alive.
There is no point of living if the change we made harm the country. The President did not know about the letter issued by the Prime Ministers office abolishing the CESS tax.
According to Ven. Rathana Thera, the CESS was imposed by the UNP regime during the time of late President J.R.Jayewardene and Minister Lalith Athulathmudali to protect local small and medium scale industries.
What is happening now is a few try to form national strategies and policies which will only ruin the country.
We cannot let trade agreements destroy the country and we will not let it happen.We cannot let individuals to plan and submit cabinet papers enabling them and their friends to earn money while destroying the country, he said.
This Government saved the port city land and that is what should be done when it comes to signing trade agreements. But a few persons are trying to do the opposite, he added.

Alleged fraudulent investment of CBSL officer revealed
Former Bank of Ceylon Chief Dealer J.D.K. Dharmapala yesterday said that an officer of the Central Bank appeared at the Bank of Ceylon to invest on Treasury bonds at a rate of 12.5 on the day prior to the questioned Treasury bond auction that took place on February 27, 2015.
The CBSL officer came to the BOC on February 26, 2015, and forwarded an application to invest on Treasury bonds. He brought Rs. 750,000 for the said investment.
These revelations came into being yesterday at the Presidential Commission.
Asked if he could assume that the said Central Bank officer had insider information regarding the Treasury bond issuance which was to happen the next day, Dharmapala said he felt so at a later stage.
The rate he requested for the Treasury bonds were 12.5, which was the same rate that the Central Bank accepted the bids the following day. I felt rather suspicious when this application was made, but I did not pay serious attention to it. I disregarded the application thinking that it was insane to invest at such a rate, Dharmapala said.
I received the information that such a CBSL officer came to invest on Treasury bonds through a BOCs Back Office lady officer. I requested her to let the CBSL officer know that we cannot accommodate such an investment, he added.
Asked if the same CBSL officer has done any investments on previous occasions on Treasury bonds, Dharmapala said, the person had not. However, Dharmapala said, the CBSL officer invested in Treasury bills at previous occasions.
Dharmapala said, he never thought that the Central Bank would accept the bids that came in for higher rates for the Treasury bond auction that took place on February 27, 2015. He said, from his professional experience, that he thought the Central Bank would accept bids which have come at rates less than a 10%. The former Chief Dealer Dharmapala is to testify before the Presidential Commission on June 9.
Senior State Council Dr. Avanti Perera led evidence for the day.

Ancient Nalanda of the scientific Buddhists
Nalanda is still an obscure entity for most people in the world. Nalanda in India is famous historically for its university, which is now re-established under a joint Asian initiative. According to the Oxford Dictionary Sciential means pertaining to or having knowledge of which are still evident in Nalanda. The fact that Nalanda was a very ancient university is becoming better known. It is hard to re-establish a university after an 800-year hiatus. One can recollect the pursuit of science in old Nalanda which will inspire and guide long run efforts in new Nalanda University.
The purpose of science is continuance, improvement refinement and enhancement of the safety, and pleasure of existence through understanding the nature of phenomena. The purpose of Dhamma or the teaching of the Buddha is the extinction of inherent impermanent existence through understanding the nature of phenomena. The recollection and more challengingly assessment of the scientific tradition in old Nalanda are important right now. A scientific attitude and disciplined thought are important for the entire conception of continuing the old Nalanda University.
There are many methods and characteristics of science. Endeavour in science uses the following modes to understand, explain and control phenomena; faith in science; observation of the World from being in the world; reasoning; insight; analysis; Inference; Repetition; Hypotheses; Assumption Approximation; control of variability; ordered attention; ordered effort; serendipity; guessing; mind, tools and equipment; statistical probability; trial; verification independent of persons places and time: Is communal; public demonstration; peer review; accessible to doubt; invites investigation; liable to experimental error; Prof by falsification; going with the stream of conventional thinking; concerned with past, present, future; recording, interpretation and statement of results; objective; all grounded on exclusion of feelings and requiring little or no necessary personal commitment of the scientist to findings.
Nalanda was an old centre of learning that attracted students from many countries in the world particularly China and Tibet, Korea and Japan and the rest of Asia, but a few also from as far in the West as Turkey. Nalanda a residential university had at its peak 10,000 students studying various subjects, Chinese students in particular such as Xuanzang and Yi Jing in the seventh century. They wrote extensively on what they saw what they particularly admired about the educational standards in Nalanda.
Incidentally, Nalanda is the only non-Chinese institution in which any Chinese scholar was educated in the history of ancient China. It is also important to recognise that while Nalanda was very special it was still a part of a larger tradition of organised higher education that developed during that period in India  in Bihar in particular. In addition to Nalanda, there were in the vicinity other such institutions such as Vikramashila and Odantapuri.

Asias reaction to Trumps America First
As America enters a turbulent phase due to President Donald Trumps America First policies and mercurial temperament, it will be important for Asia, and South Asia in particular, to improve regional economic ties and build military alliances to maintain its security and rate of growth.
So said Dr. C. Raja Mohan, Director of Carnegie India, in his keynote address at a panel discussion entitled Asian Views on Americas Role in Asia, which took place on Tuesday at the Hilton.
While calling Trump an accidental president, due to the fact that he received less than half the popular vote, Mohan argued that what matters is not how Trump rose to power but how the rest of the world responds to his new policies.
The international community has a special burden to understand what is going on in America and to prepare to cope with the consequences Trumps policy shifts are producing, he said.
These shifts can broadly be referred to as the Trumps America First policies, and they call into question decades of U.S. foreign policy, challenging the essential conventions of Americas engagement with the world community.
The idea of open borders, whereby foreigners can study and work in the United States, is under threat, as are some long-standing American alliances and the countrys role in promoting and financing globalization.
Many are worried about Americas future role with NATO, as Trump has derided the organization and withheld his support. Moreover, many Americans feel as if they have been left behind in a globalizing world, and Trump has promised to bring back many of the jobs that have gone overseas or been lost to automation.
It was due to these promises that Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and forced the renegotiation of NAFTA, a free trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
Mohan warned that South Asias economies would suffer, if America were to raise trade barriers in the near future.
Furthermore, Mohan highlighted the currently shelved travel ban and noted that there will be increased travel restrictions and targeting of illegal immigrants.
For Mohan, Trump is capturing various trends in U.S. domestic politics that crystallize around the following questions; how much of the burden should the country bear to maintain the economic order; should the country be the principal provider of markets for everything other countries produce; should the United States pay the costs of economic globalization
These questions and concomitant foreign policy shifts challenge the post-World War II international order that America inaugurated, and the countrys inward turn threatens the global status quo both in terms of economics and security.
Indeed, Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives, argued that Americas role as the steadying force in international relations was under threat.
Since 1945, America has been the balancer in international relations. There has been a certain strategic policy certainty that the U.S. would be able to play that role in a number of areas. We are now facing a situation in which there is uncertainty about the balancer. Who will play that role going forward he asked.
Despite its policy shifts, the United States will not disappear from Asia altogether. Mohan noted that the country has multiple options with regard to its policies towards the continent.
The United States can sill play a significant role by supporting other alliances. Even with retrenchment, the U.S. can do very interesting things in Asia. We dont know yet what those will be, but the U.S. is not dead and gone, he said.
John J. Brandon, Senior Director, International Relations at the Asia Foundation, argued that Americas role in the region will change, but that the Trump Administration is still very much focused on Asia. He noted that Trump has already met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguy<U+1EC5>n Xun Phc. He has also reached out to leaders from the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.
For Mohan, the key for Asia is not to get caught in the circus around whether or not Trump should be impeached or work to change his policies. Rather, the continent should start to work within the framework of these new policies.
We have to understand whats going on in America. We cannot make the assumption that this is an aberration that will return to normal soon. It is my view that we have to prepare for these transformations in U.S. policies, Mohan said.
How Should Asia Respond
Since Trump and a good deal of American citizens have doubts about the global trading system and Americas role therein, and since China seems underprepared at the moment to assume its role, Mohan argued that focusing on economic regionalism is the route for Asia, and South Asia in particular, to take.
Jinping has argued that China can replace the U.S. as the champion and chief financier of globalization, but Mohan doubts the veracity of this claim. While the U.S. maintains massive trade deficits with many countries to help spur their economic growth, China preserves trade surpluses with most countries.
Until we see a change in Chinas attitude around trade it is tough to forecast them as a replacement for the States, he said.
More economic cooperation within South Asia is key to preserving the regions economic expansion. This might mean working out deals between countries that have historically not cooperated politically or economically.
Weve had problems with economic integration in the past. The challenge for us is how do we accelerate regional economic integration And if some countries dont want to be part of that integration, can we develop alternative mechanisms through the Indian Ocean or through the Bay of Bengal Mohan asked.
Maintaining peace and security in the region will also be a central issue moving forward. Mohan argued that there will likely be transformations in the alliances and alignments of the worlds superpowers.
Many of the assumptions that weve made about the nature of U.S. relations with other great powers will be coming into greater scrutiny.
But the question for countries in Asia will be this; can we do more ourselves on the security domain Or is it going to be left entirely to the Americans We have had the luxury to expect the Americans to do everything and to criticize them for everything they did. Its a nice situation to be in, but I think that situation is not going to continue, he said.
For Mohan, it is crucial that countries large and small, powerful and weak, take on larger responsibilities in maintaining peace in the region.
Can we expand regional security cooperation Can more of us do more with each other for this cause, whether it is India and Japan, India, Japan, and Sri Lanka, or India, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives cooperating together
I think there is room here for taking more responsibility for our own regions, and I think thats going to be a big challenge, he added.
He mentioned, however, that it would be easier for South Asia to structure a balance of power and improve regional security and economic integration if the United States were to maintain a presence in the Indian Ocean in the near future.
We have a stake in the continued American role in this part of the world. And at the same time we must ensure against a significant rapid downsizing of Americas role, he said.
Mohan concluded his speech by calling for South Asia to think clearly about its own future and Americas role within it. He argued that it would be crucial to make it easier for the U.S. to operate in South Asia and to work harder to maintain economic and security ties with the States.
At the same time, however, it is necessary to create frameworks for enhanced regional economic and security cooperation.
We should focus on burden sharing and more regional integration while simultaneously engaging the U.S. on economic and political issues. I think thats the way to go. Thats the challenge that we in South Asia will have to measure, he said.

Back to Arhath Mahinda Era
May the bikkhus shed enmity and hatred; even as the Jasmine creeper sheds its faded flowers. Dhammapada]
Poson Full moon is a day of great significance to Sri Lankans, for it is on such a day that Arhant Mihinda visited Mihintale and preached the profound Dhamma. Two thousand three-hundred years after this sacred event, what we observe in this thrice-blessed land is hatred, based on ethnic, religious, cast, creed and various other divisions created mainly by misguided groups or politically motivated Sinhala-Buddhists. Violent display of protest by section of bikkhus in yellow robes participating with unruly mobs has turn into be the order of the day.
A religion known as Buddhism was not in existence in this Island or in any part of the globe then. The idea of this article is to examine the achievements of Arahath Mahindas endeavors twenty three centuries before and its significance in todays context, where the performance of pure serene Dhamma is fast fading away, or being overshadowed by observation of new socio- cultural myths and pooja systems.
Chullahasti-Padopama Sutta
ArahathMahinda thera tested the IQ of King Devanampiyatissa with a sequence of enquiries which is famous and welcomed as the first I.Q. Test recognized in any part of the world. Happy with the kings insight, he preached the Chullahasti-Padopama Sutta, MajjimaNikaya. This sutta describes how a follower recognizes the Samma Sambuddha-hood of the Buddha by active involvement in the path; the Buddha revealed to them, in an analogous way that an individual who knows well of elephants how he would distinguish a male elephant from a female.
Buddha Rejected Differences
Buddhas rejection of caste, race, and class was not just ideological, he admitted inhabitants from all castes and creed - Suneeta and Upali found respected spaces in the sasana.
Monks, all the rivers, like Ganges, Jamna , Achiravati, and Sarabu once fall into the ocean lose their former names and identities and recognized as the ocean.
Bikkhu Vagga; Dhammapada says,
He who controls his hand, controls his foot, controls his speech and is well controlled in all respectsis composed, solitary and contenthim they call a Buddhist monk  verse 362.
Unfortunately, today there is no direct control; the four Maha Nayake theros of the three Nikayas must act now. The bikkhu order is vitiated by the presence of astrologers, brokers, physicians, political henchmen, merchants, landlords, car sale owners caring naught for the spiritual welfare of the people or society, they are wrapped in their own worldly interests. Steps must be taken to expel such undesirable elements from sasana; also prevent others from joining their ranks. The Nayake theras have no way of ruling on what is being done outside their temple precincts, no proper mechanism exists for communication. Some monks are like a flock without a leader; they have their own ways of handling grievances.
The Third Buddhist council by summoned by Emperor Asoka was an outcome of his great thinking. This historic Council initiated the dispatch of several missions to neighboring countries for the purpose of distributing the ideologies of Dhamma. Emperor Asoka specifically selected Sri Lanka ruled by his friend Devanampiyatissa when he decided on missions. Accordingly, Emperors son Mahinda Thera was entrusted with the assignment of introducing Dhamma to Sri Lanka in 236 BC. The Theravada Buddha Dhamma introduced by him lasts even after two and a half millennia. But sadly the Sasana lacks an organized institution or a connecting link between one activity and other: it is wandering aimlessly like a headless body.
Strategy of Arhant Mahinda
Arhant Mahinda Thera did not rush but spent time researching the circumstances that existed in the island. He found King Mutasiva who was ruling the nation was old and feeble that he may not be able to handle the enormous task affectively. He marked time until the advent of most suitable period to launch his mission, but took advantage of the wait by learning language of Lankans. Arhant Mahinda suspected the vicious clans that pay reverence to the mythological deities, worship trees rocks would have thwarted the launch of an unfamiliar philosophy that rejects such practices. Arhant Mihindu thera faced challenges successfully through King Devanampiyatissa subsequently. However, soon he established unstinted support from the rulers and the people.
In the Parimandala Vagga Vinaya rule no. 7 says,
A Buddhist monk should wear the under-robe all round. A Buddhist monk should wear the upper-robe even all round. A Buddhist monk should walk well covered in inhabited areas. A Buddhist monk should sit well covered in inhabited areas. A Buddhist monk should walk well restrained in inhabited areas. A Buddhist monk should sit well restrained in inhabited areas. A Buddhist monk should walk with lowered eyes in inhabited areas. A Buddhist monk should sit with lowered eyes in inhabited areas. A Buddhist monk should not walk with robes hitched up in inhabited areas. A Buddhist monk should not sit with robes hitched up in inhabited areas.
At numerous student demonstrations it is a common sight that a good number of young monks leaving their robes behind and running for safety when attacked by security men.
Dhamma and Vegetarianism
king Devanam piyatissa whose hobby was to kill animal, became a vegetarian, followed by large section of the nations population. Agricultural economy outdid the customary meat industry. Arhat Mahindas visit followed later by his own sister, Sanghamitta Therini, who arrived with the idea of inaugarating a Bhikkhuni Sasana, in the island.
The Bo sapling, a branch of the Siri Maha Bodhi she brought with her, was planted in the Mahamevuna Uyana, which continues to bless the nation.
Foreign invasions over the centuries have, to some extent, reformed the cultural distinctiveness of the people, especially in the Western costal belt where, since the 16th century, the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British had some influence in the people, but the cultural and religious uniqueness of the nation remained unscratched to a great extent. The introduction of tobacco, alcohol, and flesh including slaughter of cattle for food by them, changed the lifestyles of sections of inhabitants. We believe that the Buddha picked Lanka as the place that would preserve the Dhamma. The nation was resurrected on that noble day. This leads to a profound understanding of the nation for all groups of people in Sri Lanka to live in peace and harmony.
Mihintale was somewhat neglected with the shifting of the capital in 1058 to Polonnaruwa; the commitment and royal sponsorship that the sacred place received began to vanish.
Offering hundred thousands of flowers, one hundred thousand of Jasmines one million Araliya, and conduct of processions with hundred elephants, the vesak pandals and veask zones are not true Buddhism. We need learned Theros to preach pure Dhamma discourses the way Arahant Mihinda Thero did.
Young Siduhath as a boy, saw the plough turning up the soil, killing worms, and exposing the others to be picked up by predators. Even consuming rice involves the inadvertent destruction of life. The only response is to get off the wheel.
The problem with this argument is that it creates confusion. On an existential level, pretty right, any form of being, including the most scrupulous, will manifestly cause injury to some beings.
This is one of the causes why it has become necessary to flee away from rebirth on the whole. Ethics or principles are not concerned with the final escape from all suffering. Being vegetarian or vegan we will still cause destruction. And there are boundary concerns as to what is really vegetarian. Bees are destroyed for honey Animal bones are used for the decontamination process organs are used in production of medicinal drugs.
The real truth is that eating meat cause massive destruction to many creatures. That harm is, always easily avoidable. Becoming vegetarian does not employ any huge sacrifices or ethical bravery. It just takes a little self-control and concern. Today, there is a large variety of delicious, cheap, nutritious vegetarian foods easily accessible. The choice of becoming vegetarian is, of all ethical choices we can make, one of the most beneficial, at the minimum cost to ourselves. Back to the fundamental problem; as Buddhists, we expect that the Buddha preserved the highest possible ethical ways; and for the most part, he did. So if the Buddha allowed something, we feel there cant be anything wrong with it. There is nothing inflexible or unreasonable about such a conviction.
Let us resolve on this important occasion, to re-establish inter-ethnic, inter-religious harmony that we have been yearning to achieve for over the decades. Work towards temperance and an anti-tobacco nation which is free of meat eating. Practice the basics of the Dhamma.

Bacsinszky wants birthday to remember, make Ostapenkos forgettable
Paris: French Open semi-finalists Timea Bacsinszky and Jelena Ostapenko both celebrate their birthdays on Thursday but the Swiss star insists she'll be happy to ruin the party for her close friend. Bacsinszky reached the Roland Garros semi-finals for the second time on Tuesday with a rain-hit 6-4, 6-4 win over home hope Kristina Mladenovic.
Bacsinszky, who also made the last four in 2015, will face unseeded Ostapenko who stunned Danish 11th seed Caroline Wozniacki 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 for a place in Saturday's final.
But Thursday's last-four duel also falls on the day when world number 31 Bacsinszky turns 28 while Ostapenko, ranked 47, is 20.
"It's a nice story, pretty cool," said Bacsinszky who was already aware of the quirk in the calendar.
"We played doubles together in Wuhan last year and we have practised a lot together.
"She's a really nice girl. We saw each other in the gym after today's matches and congratulated each other and hugged.
"Yeah, it's pretty funny we have the same birthday.
"Lucky for her that she's just 20 but maybe lucky for me as I have more experience!" Bacsinszky, playing in her third successive French Open quarter-final, will be the favourite on Thursday. Ostapenko has never made the semis of a major.
Before Roland Garros she had never got past the third round.The Latvian is hoping to become the first player since Gustavo Kuerten at the 1997 French Open to win their first tour-level title at a Grand Slam.
Kuerten's breakthrough triumph at Roland Garros coincidentally came on the very same day that Ostapenko was born.
Bacsinszky, meanwhile, knows what it's like to be on the semi-final stage, going three sets before losing to Serena Williams in Paris in 2015. "There has always been a kind of magic here for me," said the Swiss star after Tuesday's rain-interrupted match which took almost six hours to complete.
"Even the first time I came here as a little kid, there's been a special bond."
Despite that attachment, she admitted she was struck by nervous anxiety on the eve of Tuesday's quarter-final.
She even woke up in a sweat at four in the morning, dazed by a nightmare that she had left Roland Garros but had forgotten to buy tournament towels for her friends. "I was sweating over this. I guess if I wasn't playing the big matches in a Grand Slam I wouldn't have these nightmares. "But it's good to be nervous -- it shows that I am not a robot."
After seeing off Mladenovic, Bacsinszky said the weather conditions which saw heavy rain as well as 30km/h winds had been tough to deal with.
"We had a hurricane, a sandstorm and almost snow," she said before adding that coming from Switzerland, it wasn't hard to adapt.
"I practiced in Bienne a few weeks ago with (Swiss player) Victorija Golubic and it was snowing.
"So heavy clay I'm used to it. That was an appetizer for today."

BIRTHPLACE of Lankan Buddhism
Centuries back in 247 BC Arahant Mahinda Thera was seen atop Mihintale. He delivered the first lesson of the Buddhist teachings to King Devanampiyatissa. The king had gone on hunting. He was taught that killing of animals is improper.
This sleepy village and temple complex, 13km east of Anuradhapura, holds a special place in the annals of Sri Lankan lore. In 247 BC King Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura was hunting a stag on Mihintale Hill when he was approached by Mahinda, son of the great Indian Buddhist emperor, Ashoka. Mahinda tested the kings wisdom and, considering him to be a worthy disciple, promptly converted the king on the spot. Mihintale has since been associated with the earliest introduction of Buddhism to Sri Lanka.
Each year a great festival, the Poson Poya, is held at Mihintale on the Poson full-moon night (usually in June) to commemorate the conversion of Devanampiya Tissa.
Mihintale Mountain, with the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, began to serve as a residential area for the venerable monks headed by Arahath Mahinda Mahathera. But soon, with the royal patronage, the sanctuary housed a multitude of with monastic buildings-stupas, uposathgharas, bodhigharas- to serve the monks. Sixty eight cave dwellings provided the monks shade and shelter. Mihintale, the sanctuary for many thousands of laymen as well as holy men, had all the facilities and amenities for basic living.
The great stairway that leads up the Mihintale Mountain consists of no less than 1840 rock cut steps. While some of the neat steps are carved into the natural rock, the rest are paved with cut granite.
Exceedingly wide for a pedestrian climb, the impressive staircase of unique distinction, well sheltered and shaded with frangipani flower trees and ever-green wood makes a very pleasant climb.
The blossoms of Araliya (frangipani) make the staircase fragrant while the intrusive hoards of monkeys hover around and hang in the branches of the trees to grab snacks off the visitors.When one proceeds along the ancient stairway-about half the distance, the path branches off to the right into a still steeper climb.
The pathway, which consists of about 80 steps, leads you to the site of the Kantaka Cetiya. The branch pathway is 10 feet wide and about half the size of the stone steps laid on the main path. Mahasaya, Atvehera and Rajagirilena Kanda are approached through similar pathways.
All over the world, high places are given religious significance, with the result that devotees are always climbing steps. Sometimes on their knees. Mihintale is one such place, its various shrines connected by a total of some 1,840 steps that ultimately lead to the summit  steep enough to require deep breaths and a meditative pace. They were built in the reign of Bhathika Abhaya (22 BCAD 7), although a later paved road provides a short cut up to the first level.
A five-minute drive from the main entrance brings you to the sylvan Pond of Black Water. This peaceful artificial lake supplied water to a monastery that stood here during the 10th or 11th centuries. A few fragmentary monastic ruins stand around the lake including a quaint little structure comprising a facade and roof built onto a natural rock overhang  half cave, half house. The minimalist decoration is misleading, however, since these monks were definitely not roughing it like the troglodytic pioneers of Buddhism on the hillside above, but enjoyed the comforts of indoor toilets and bath houses.
In the beginning Mihintale monastery established itself as the Rain Retreat of the Buddhist monks. In the sixteenth chapter of Mahavamsa, the Great Chronicle of Sri Lanka, composed in Pali verse by the Buddhist monk Mahanama narrates Arhath Mahinda and his followers, who spent their first three weeks at the Mahamegha Park in the Royal city of Anuradhapura, chose to retreat to the natural sanctuary of Mihintale, the location of their arrival itself to spend their first Vassa (Sinhala: Rain Retreat) during the months of July to September, thereby initiating an annual ritual for the Buddhist monks. Having heard of the Rain Retreat, King Devanampiya Tissa had sixty eight rock cells at Mihintale made habitable and gifted them to the Buddhist monks on the full moon month of Asalha (in the lunar oriented 12 month Sinhalese calendar) that falls within the months of July-August of the Gregorian calendar.

Bradby Shield 2nd leg: Trinity were inconsistent
Royal adopted a well-constructed team effort, helped by some superb defensive work that saw the newly crowned league Cup champions claim their most valued prize the coveted Bradby Shield in the second leg worked off at the Royal Complex.
The host team came into the 2nd leg with a five-point lead and showcased a fine team performance to hold the dangerous Trinitians at bay to claim the shield for the 3rd consecutive year with an aggregate score of 35-25.
The league champs however, were the better team on the day adapting to the conditions using their big forwards in close range with pick and goes, which helped Royal earn a few penalties, which they decided to kick to touch and set up their piece-de-resistance, the rolling maul. Trinity however, having done their homework, succeeded in repelling the hosts attacks time and again.
Trinity were disappointed with the final result (13-8) as they had high hopes and expectations, But it went to show that they failed to click as a team although they had all the resources and ability, Probably it attributes to poor leadership, inconsistency in executing the game plan or counter attacking the opponents strategy with a drive to win. Credit to Royal.
Trinity in this game backed one error up with another. Royal won the loose mauls; they went for the driving maul. They found space; they spoiled everything by frustrating their opponents excellently. Royal started the second half well, looking calm and controlled, and were the superior team in that half, and had far more possession and territorial advantage.
Trinity had a lot to sort out, from poor line outs, scrums and were ineffective in the loose. They had some good attacking players, but in this game they were all inconsistent in attacking and defending.
It was a very enjoyable game of rugby to watch with both sides competing well from start to finish but one in which Royal were always on top.

Buddhist perspective of genuine happiness
People love their lives, i.e. they love to continue living. They do not like to die. It is the first basic right as far as humans are concerned. It is also the first Fundamental Human Right as listed by the United Nations. It is the right of everyone to live without any threat whatsoever to one's life.
Buddhism goes even further than this. The Buddhists extend this right to live happily to all living things, voicing it as May all beings be well and happy" (Sabbe satta bhavantu sukhitatta)
What is really meant by happiness It is a term which is not easy to define. According to some philosophers what constitutes happiness is purely subjective, emotive or attitudinal. Buddhism takes a different viewpoint.
The Buddhist position is that there is an inseparable connection between morality and happiness: What is morally good leads to happiness. What is morally bad leads to unhappiness.
Meaningful life
If I ask you why you seek happiness, your natural answer would be, I want to lead a meaningful life. Herein we come across the problem: interpretation of the word meaningful.
A meaningful life does not depend on your bank account, or the behaviour of your spouse, or your job, or your salary. A meaningful life must answer a simple question, What have I brought to the world If you can look at a day and see that virtue, truth, and living an altruistic life are prominent elements, you can say, You know, Im really a happy camper.
One of my ex-employees has a rare disease, and every month he goes to the hospital for dialysis and drug treatment, and will for the rest of his life. You could say, Well, thats a tragedy, a dismal situation. But the last time I spoke with him, he said, Look, Im happy. And he was. He was finding a way within the very limited parameters of what was available to him. His mind is clear. Hes reading, he has a backyard full of vegetables, hes meditating, and hes teaching meditation to other patients in his hospital. Hes living a very meaningful life in which he can honestly say that he is happy.
The good news is that genuine happiness is not out there in the market place to be purchased or acquired from the best teacher around. One of the best kept secrets is that the happiness were striving for so desperately in the perfect spouse, the great children, fine job and excellent health, depends so much on external events, people, and situations, which are all beyond your control. It is not something just waiting to be unveiled. We should know that the genuine happiness we are seeking comes from within us. That knowledge changes everything.
Kusala Kamma
Buddhism has no concept equivalent to that of sin. While there may be gods in Buddhism, there is no Eternal Creator and Judge. In Buddhism actions are judged by their utilitarian value: whether they lead to greater happiness for the person and affected others, and whether they lead to better karma, rebirth, and progress on the path to Enlightenment. The Buddhist terms for judging whether actions have a felicitous or infelicitous effect are kusala and akusala, which usually gets translated as either wholesome and unwholesome, or skillful and unskillful. The utilitarian nature of these concepts is made clear in the Kusala Sutta (Anguttara Nikaya 2.19):
An action characterized by kusala kamma, which are wholesome, skillful, good, meritorious, is bound to result (eventually) in happiness and a favorable outcome. Actions characterized by its opposite (akusala kamma) lead to sorrow.
When we say that skillful and meritorious actions promote happiness, we are not just talking about the happiness of the individual. In Buddhism the individual and others in the community have equal claims to happiness. Buddhism is, neither individualist nor collectivist, but represents a middle-way between these dialectical opposites.
Selfish behaviour does not bring genuine happiness, but only fleeting sense pleasures and ego gratification. Selfishness disturbs our loving social ties with others, creates dissension in the community, and makes us slaves to the hedonic treadmill of transient pleasure. The Buddha believed that real happiness came from the cultivation of wisdom and character. Aristotle differentiated eudamonia, or genuine well-being, from hedonia, or sense-based pleasure. Contemporary Positive Psychology is demonstrating the truth of the Aristotelian-Buddhist idea of a deeper, more worthwhile sense of well-being that is wisdom and character based.
Mindfulness
If we are to live skillfully and meritoriously, we must first establish some degree of control over our unruly minds. This is where mindfulness comes in. If were heedless of thoughts were driven by them like a leaves in the wind. If were mindful of thoughts, we can exercise discerning judgment about them. We can discern whether or not a thought is skillful and then decide whether or not to rehearse, practice, nurture, and reinforce it.
We should avoid unskillful and unmeritorious behavior because we want ourselves and others to be happy, not because were afraid of a Gods wrath. The only source of retribution we really need worry about is the one we ought to: Cause-and-Effect. This is true whether one believes in the Buddhist concept of karma, or the modern scientific understanding of cause and effect.
Thus, a mind that has realized the Buddhist goals of subduing greed, hatred and egoism while developing love, wisdom and compassion is a mind that will have a natural and spontaneous happiness.
Buddhist ethics
It is obvious, then, that while Buddhism proceeds from a very different set of premises than most other religions, it is nearly complete agreement as to the standards of ethical conduct: love, kindness, charity and generosity are universally hailed by all of mans great philosophers and leaders.
In addition, Buddhism takes a further step in this direction. It teaches how to achieve these ethical ideals as living realities. It not only teaches to love or metta, it tells us how to achieve the genuine feeling that is metta. For love and compassion, like all other aspects of this universe, arise through cause and effect.
The Buddha regarded the question of ultimate beginnings as irrelevant to the problems of life in the present. Change and cause and effect are the paramount features of the Buddhist concept of the universe. All things mental, physical and social go through an unending process of birth, growth, decay and death. Nothing finite is static, immortal or unchanging. Whatever has an origin is subject to cessation, be it man or mountain, consciousness or constellation. And what is it that regulates this unending flow of flux and mutation The answer is cause and effect
The primary concern of Buddhist ethics is the reduction (and, finally, the elimination) of greed, anger, delusion and suffering. But these primary goals naturally lead to a social ethic and one that operates independently of political, theological or doctrinal ideologies. For it works as follows: as men learn to lessen the greed, hatred and egoism that burn in their hearts, and as kindness and compassion gain prominence in human motivations, then will men strive to better the world in whatever way their immediate situation affords.
The whole point of Buddha-dharma is that liberation comes not by believing in the right set of tenets or of dogmatic assertions, or even necessarily by behaving in the right way. It is the insight, it is the wisdom, it is the knowing the nature of reality. Finally, it is only the truth that will make us free.

Insurance sector in Sri Lanka has developed to a commendable level. However the following needs clarification.
In the scope of cover for Risk it is stated Strikes, Riots and Civil Commotions Civil Commotion means uprising of the people against the Government (like Mutiny). No insurance cover is possible for same.
French Revolution against King Louis the 16th English Revolution against King Charles are the best examples. They were beheaded by the people. JVP and LTTE Insurgencies in 1971, 1987, 1977 cannot be called Civil Commotion but are defined as Act of Terrorism.

Debris from Myanmar military plane found in sea
MYANMAR: Pieces of a Myanmar military plane which went missing with more than 100 soldiers and family members aboard were found in the Andaman Sea late Wednesday, a local official said.
Navy ships and aircraft had been searching since the afternoon when the plane lost contact with air traffic controllers.
More than a dozen children
were believed to be among the passengers on the plane travelling from the southern city of Myeik to Yangon.
Now they have found pieces of the damaged plane in the sea 136 miles (218 km) away from Dawei city, said Naing Lin Zaw, a tourism official in Myeik, adding the navy was still searching the sea.
An air force source confirmed to AFP that a navy search and rescue ship had found pieces of the plane in the sea an hours flight south of Yangon, Myanmars commercial capital.
The commander in chiefs office said the plane lost contact at about 1:35 pm (07:05 GMT) off Myanmars southern coast. There was conflicting information about the number of people on board.
Giving an updated figure, the office said 106 passengers were on board -- soldiers and family members -- along with 14 crew.
The air force source said more than a dozen of those on board were children.
Four naval ships and two air force planes were sent to search for the plane, which was flying at an altitude of more than 18,000 feet (5,486 metres).
It is monsoon season in Myanmar but there were no reports of bad weather at the time the plane went missing.
The plane was a Y-8F-200 four-engine turboprop, a Chinese-made model still commonly used by Myanmars military for transporting cargo.
The army said it was delivered in March last year and had logged 809 flying hours.
The former military junta bought many of the aircraft from Myanmars giant neighbour during their 50 years of isolated rule, when they were squeezed by Western sanctions.
A former executive at the aviation ministry said many of the aircraft in Myanmars fleet were old and decrepit.
Myanmar air force has very bad safety performance, he said, asking to remain nameless.
Myanmars military fleet has a chequered recent history of plane crashes.
All five crew died when an air force plane burst into flames soon after taking off from the capital Naypyidaw in February last year.
Three army officers were killed in June when their Mi-2 helicopter crashed into a hillside and burst into flames in south-central Bago.
A surge in demand for air travel as Myanmar opens up has stretched the impoverished countrys aviation infrastructure, in particular in remote airports.
Commercial jets have also suffered frequent incidents.
The worst in recent years was in 2012 when an Air Bagan jet crash-landed in thick fog and burst into flames short of the runway at Heho airport, killing one passenger and a motorcyclist on the ground.- AFP

Flooded with generosity
The recent floods and landslides are slowly subsiding but its aftermath and the massive rehabilitation effort that is now required to resurrect the lives of those affected is proving to be an enormous challenge for the government and all the agencies concerned.
The disaster left at least 212 persons dead including 44 children and a further 79 are reported missing. Over 21,000 people are still displaced, having lost their dwellings and possessions. Nearly 3,000 houses have been completely destroyed. It is certainly among the more devastating natural disasters to hit the country in recent years.
The Ratnapura District was the worst affected with 87 confirmed dead and 14 reported missing. More than 13,000 persons in the district are displaced. About 760 houses have been destroyed with over 5,000 homes partially damaged. The Kalutara District was the second worst affected in terms of deaths, with 66 confirmed deaths and 50 listed missing, according to statistics released from the Disaster Management Centre.
Life is now slowly returning to normal in the flood affected regions with schools re-opening and rehabilitation getting underway. However fresh threats of the outbreak of diarrheal and other diseases loom.
Natural disasters
Although the government cannot be blamed for natural disasters, there was a political fallout in the wake of the floods and landslides with the Opposition questioning the governments preparedness to handle the crisis- as well as the absence of key personalities from the country.
While it could be argued that the authorities could have been better prepared to deal with floods and landslides, officials have responded saying that the scale of the disaster- with a vast extent of the country and a large number of people affected- was such that preparations fell short of what was required and what was predicted.
Sri Lankas worst natural disaster was the 2004 Tsunami where 35,000 people perished in a matter of minutes. However, that was a disaster where access to those affected was readily available soon after the disaster- and the relief effort could get underway straight away. The recent floods were different as roads remained impassable for days, hampering the relief effort and putting more lives at risk.
Another question that is being raised is why, in this day and age of advanced technology, the disaster could not be predicted. Had that been done, those in the flood and landslide prone areas could have been forewarned and evacuated, preventing deaths even if damage to property cannot be avoided. Indeed, it has been pointed out that other countries frequently encounter similar disasters of greater magnitude, yet escape fatalities because they are better prepared.
As the disaster unfolded, it was President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who took the lead in co-ordinating the rescue effort. They held regular, round the clock meetings with officials to ensure that relief was on the way as fast as circumstances allowed.
New vehicles for ministers
However, the government came in for some flak as the floods hit around the same time as Parliament debated the import of new vehicles for ministers. This appeared insensitive at best and attracted much criticism, especially on social media.
The government was to defer the decision to import these vehicles until funds had been allocated for those displaced by the floods but this decision didnt get a fraction of the publicity that the news about the import of vehicles generated. As a result, the government was left with some explaining to do.
There was also much angst about the absence of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, days after the disaster unfolded. Prior to his departure for the United States, Wickremesinghe worked tirelessly, overseeing the rescue effort and ensuring that everything possible was being done to make life easier for the displaced.
However, when he left the country, it was conveyed that he was on a private visit to the United States. This led to a backlash in the media, with cartoonists having a field day showing the Prime Minister flying away on an aircraft waving to those marooned by the floods. In hindsight, it appears that the Prime Ministers office missed an opportunity to inform the public of the circumstances of his visit, because that would have allayed the criticism.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghes visit was for medical investigations and treatment. He had been advised to do so for many months now but had been postponing this due to official commitments. He had then been advised that to postpone his visit further would be detrimental to his health.
No one would grudge the Prime Minister receiving medical treatment but by the time his office made known the reasons for his overseas visit, some damage had been done. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe himself later took to social media to clarify the situation, tweeting My sincere thanks for the numerous messages I received since I had to leave Sri Lanka for a long overdue medical check-up; I regret I was unable to continuously be on ground as I have in the past. Prior to leaving I put in place the overall disaster management mechanisms and have been receiving relevant reports on a six hourly basis.
Also at the receiving end was Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa. Minister Yapa was away in Mexico attending -ironically- a conference on disaster management but did not return to the country immediately.
Now back in Sri Lanka, Minister Yapa defended his decision to remain in Mexico at the height of the disaster. I went to Mexico to represent Sri Lanka and I was also holding the position of co-chairman. I knew that my deputy minister as well as the rest of the ministry officials along with other government departments and the military was responding well to the disaster situation. I made daily calls to stay updated on the developments and gave instructions from Mexico. I worked hard to wrap up as soon as possible and returned four days earlier than planned, Yapa told the media on his return. While what the Minister says maybe accurate, it would have been prudent for him to return sooner because he is now being accused of being insensitive at best- and selfish at worst.
Cabinet reshuffle
Interestingly, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who made some public comments about the governments lack of preparedness for the floods, also left the country on a visit to Japan at the invitation of a Buddhist organisation there. This too has attracted much criticism- and Rajapaksa certainly cannot claim that he was visiting overseas for medical treatment or on official duties. What this also means is that the Joint Opposition (JO), of which he is the de fact leader, cannot criticise the government as much as it would like to do.
The government could also have done without the swearing in of four deputy ministers and four state ministers at the height of the floods crisis. This was a sequel to the Cabinet reshuffle days earlier but it led to the allegation that while hundreds have died and thousands have been displaced, all the government was concerned about was swearing in new ministers. Given the context of the unfolding crisis, it would have been better had the swearing in of these ministers been postponed. As it has been already pointed out, if the Cabinet reshuffle could be delayed for months on end, surely the swearing in of junior ministers could have been delayed for a few more days
Nevertheless, the disaster has prompted the government to rethink its strategies vis--vis natural calamities. Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa revealed that the government was considering laws to enable forcible evacuation and also laws to ban cultivation of crops along the mountain slopes, in order to prevent landslides in the future.
The government has also come up with novel measures- such as providing electricity free of charge for six months- to assist the flood and landslide victims but the rehabilitation effort will need to be sustained with the same intensity over the next few months.
Parliament will debate the disaster tomorrow where there will always be bickering about who did what and what could have been done better, but if ever there was a redeeming feature in the calamity, it was the overwhelmingly generous response from the general public towards the relief effort that shone through as a silver lining amidst the darks clouds of disaster and despair.

Go forth, for the well being of humans
The Buddha the perfect one was of an exceptional breed.
His message was to all mankind regardless of colour caste creed.
The fountain of compassion the universal teacher blessed the humanity with the supreme truth as a great preacher.
Enlightenment of the Buddha viewed with great reverence
Led to the doctrine of Dhamma and its emergence
Go forth Bhikkus taking the message into the world explain to them, what I have explained the Buddha so, said
For the wellbeing of the majority solace of the living so that they will see the light with no craving.
The message thus proclaimed was the greatest victory to have been achieved by anyone inhuman history.
This is also the greatest and most glorious single event in Sri Lankan culture endowed with the gist of all that is meant.
The message thus proclaimed was brought in the Poson full moon day. Arahath Mahinda appeared on Mihintale to everybody's dismay.
This was the most historic event in the Buddha Sasana. For each and every Buddhist for their endless wasana.
Poson in many respects marks the coming of age of our nation.
For it is Arahat Mahinda, that gave birth to the great civilisation.
This is a wonderful way for Lankans to realise the uplift of the cultural diversity accompanied with the immortal gift.
It was a precious gift from Emperor Asoka the great. To his friend in Lanka that decided its fate.
Arahat Mahinda led the Dhammadutha Mission and Lanka became the recipient of his far-sighted vision.
The king was engaged in hunting chasing a deer when Arahat addressed him by name as a person very close and dear.
He tested the king's intelligence in the course of the conversation
To understand Buddhism sans any hesitation.
The king accepted Buddhism followed by the people the supreme truth which in no way could be called simple.
Mihintale rock emerged as a platform of our civilisation. It is here that the king embraced Buddhism minutes after his conversion
To the Great Masters spiritual message in addition. It's influence on daily life had a great impact on our tradition.
Arahat Mahinda not only brought Buddhism, but also a culture comprising of arts and crafts, architecture and sculpture.
He also brought Pali language which enriched Sinhala literature.
It is the widely revered Tripitaka the most sacred Buddhist scripture.
The archaeological remains found in main cities are a glowing tribute to the cultural development that was currently prevalent.
Ahimsa was honoured as the theme of non-violence righteous living became the order of the day giving if prominence.
Introduction of ordination was another major event.
Paving the way for the attainment of spiritual heights.
Ever since, Thera Mahinda came to be called Anubudhu Arahath Mahinda, being second only to Supreme Thathagatha
Samanamayang Maharaja Dhammarajassa Sevaka
Thamena Anukampaya Jambudeepa Idhagatha
So said, thera Mahinda, the disciples of Supreme Thathagatha.

Govt. urged to create more jobs
Production based economy will keep women here:
An organisation called Free Woman urged the government to create more jobs within the country by initiating a production based economy to minimise the number of women going abroad for foreign jobs.
The convener said women going for foreign jobs are subjected to numerous issues, including losing the lives.
The solution to minimise the number going abroad for employment is to create more employment opportunities within the country.
The government is duty bound to generate more employment opportunities by implementing a production based economy. The government has failed in implementing a production based economy she said.
She said the intervention of the government institutions, including the Foreign Employment Bureau, Diplomatic Missions abroad, are not sufficient in connection with the issues faced by the women employed abroad.
She said foreign jobs means slavery.
Women employed abroad are subjected to sexual harassment, while others are tortured.
She said many women tend to go for foreign employment due to the shortage of jobs in the country.

How to see the Buddha properly and meaningfully
One of the disciples of the Buddha named Vakkali had a habit of gazing upon Him every day with much attachment.
The Buddha having noticed this asked, what are you doing here Vakkalis reply was Venerable Sir, when I look at the serene features and good complexion of your body, that itself gives me a lot of satisfaction.
The Buddha then asked, what do you expect to gain by admiring this body which is dirty, impure, ugly, smelly and impermanent One who sees the Dharma sees the Buddha perfectly.
This helps us to understand how to see the real Buddha. If we indeed want to see the real Buddha, then we must reflect on that Buddha in our minds through the realisation of His Noble Teachings.
The voice of the Buddha is the most powerful voice that has been heard in human history in support of the dignity of man and of the principle that man is the maker of his own destiny, and that man is not for religion but that religion must serve man.
That means: without becoming a slave to any religion or faith, man must attempt to make use of religion for his own betterment and liberation. Bertrand Russell, a well-known philosopher once said,
Among the founders of all religions in this world, I respect only one man  the Gautama Buddha. The main reason was that He did not make statements regarding the origin of the world. The Buddha was the only teacher who realised the true nature of the world.
But, while many others made unjustifiable claims based on rather simplistic logic on how the world originated, the Buddha did not commit himself to any statement about a beginning. This was because he knew his listeners did not have proper intellectual training and understanding of the physical world to comprehend what He himself had discovered.
The Buddhas noble example was a source of inspiration to all his iron will, profound wisdom, universal love, boundless compassion, selfless service, historic renunciation, perfect purity and magnetic personality have inspired people of the present world to respect Him as the world  honoured Supreme Teacher.
Buddha says, There may be many disciples who stay with me, follow me by holding my hand or clinging to my robes, thereby, thinking that they are close to me.
On the other hand, there may be some other disciples who are far away from me and who have not even see me, but if their minds are pure, even though they are staying far away, they are indeed very close to me. Those who stay with me but exist only with polluted minds are in fact not at all close to me.
Under these circumstances, as shown by the doctrine of the Buddha, we all should make every effort to see the Buddha by practising His Noble Teachings wholeheartedly in order to be liberated from the bonds of the Samsaric journey which has no end.

Impact of the Buddhas words
About 2380 year back a valiant king of our beloved Motherland was on a happy hunting spree close to the summit of Mihintale rock. Tissa Tissa, said a voice. King Devanampiya Tissa was puzzled. Maybe he was angry at being called by his given name.
Those hallowed words were to be the auspicious spring of a new era, which would engulf Lanka with the Teachings of one of the noblest and Enlightened who walked this earth.
A gracious and repentant king abandons his deer killing pastime, throws his bow and arrow and becomes the first Lankan to embrace the teachings of Gautama Buddha, made known to him by Mahinda, the son of one of the noblest kings who had ruled on this earth. King Asoka was an invincible monarch and conqueror, who practically took over most parts of Bharath and Mongolia. This was about 200 years after the Buddha attained Nirvana.
After the famous battle of Kalinga, King Asoka upon seeing the massacred human beings threw his weapons of death down and sought the words of the Enlightened one. H. G. Wells, in his epic Outlines of world history calls him the greatest monarch of the world who walked this earth preaching and living through example the Teachings of his Master. He led others into the beautiful path of tolerance. His immortal edicts have been enshrined in the Ashok Chakra in the hallowed Indian National flag. It was this sagacious King who sent his beloved son Mahinda on that memorable Poson Full Moon day to our land. History was made that day. This everlasting happening took place 236 years after the passing away of the Buddha and about 300 years before another revered Teacher preached his words on Love, forgiveness, humility and the wages of greed and peace. He was Jesus Christ.
May I as a follower of Jesus Christ, in a little gem of an island where more than 70% are Buddhists, share my thoughts as a Christian, on this lovely day on the impact the words of Gautama Buddha have had in our country.
The Buddha walked on this earth for eighty years and preached for about forty years. He visited our blessed land three times. He left his footprint on the summit of a mountain. Thousands of simple devout followers of Gautama Buddha visit this hallowed shrine between the full moon Poyas of Duruthu and Vesak. I was privileged to trek up to the summit, pay my respects to the Holy Footprint, ring the bell once and see the awe-inspiring ira sevaya or sunrise. There were six happy Catholics in the naday. All of us simulated the walk of our Jesus Christ up to the summit of Mount Calvary.
When we reached the summit we felt that both our celestial Teachers were there to welcome us.
The Buddha spoke on the five noble precepts that are for all time. He said that man was his own decider of his destiny. He has to paddle his own canoe to the final destination, which could be determined only by his actions. Yes! He said, Do not do to others what you do not wish to be done to yourself. Years later, Jesus said He that is without sin let him cast the first stone when a woman in sin was brought before Him by the hypocritical Jewish elite.
The Buddha said Thanahathi Jayathi Shoka - sorrow is always behind greed. How true. This beautiful saying has also been mentioned by Jesus Christ when he said: It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of Heaven. We have seen how prophetic and through provoking words these sayings are when we go down memory lane.
I believe in the existence God. He gave us a conscience, a free will to know right and wrong. He gave us Celestial Teachers to guide us towards Nirvana. Once, a very high ranking church dignitary said. (quote) You know son, it is the fragrance of the Buddhas teachings that has made this country to be resplendent as a tolerant, compassionate Nation with smiling citizens.
We have been exposed to the sublime teachings of the Buddha that have made this land a veritable Garden of Eden.

Law to prevent sale,auctioning of sporting medals to be introduced
Sports Minister and Co-Cabinet spokesperson, Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday said he would introduce a law which would prevent the sale or auction of any medal won at an international sporting event.
The medal will be the property of the government, the athlete will not be allowed to sell or auction it. It is ugly to be selling medals,Jayasekara addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday.
Former Olympic Silver Medallist and athlete, Susanthika Jayasinghe this week caused a stir when she declared that she would have to auction her silver Olympic medal as the Ministry of Sports was planning to stop the payment of her monthly salary.
The government has invested millions in Susanthika up to and beyond the point she won her medal. When we came into power in 2015, she did not have a job. It was I who called her in an offered an advisory position within the Ministry, the Minister said responding to her allegations.
He explained that in 2016, the Ministry offered her position as a consultant to their Talent Identification Programme for a monthly salary of Rs 60,000 and an additional fuel allowance of Rs 15,000 along with a vehicle.The programme was to go on until 2024 and cabinet approved her position up to 2020.
When I handed her the appointment letter which specifically stated her job description, she said oh I was paid Rs.80,000 earlier. Now you are giving me Rs.60,000. We had identified her specific duties, she had to visit the 312 schools our programme was active in and meet 13-year-old athletes and look into their training, diet, health and injuries, the Minister said.
Jayasinghe was also supposed to submit monthly progress reports and tasks she planned on undertaking in addition to yearly plans. In April of this year, the Secretary to the Ministry noted that she had not submitted a single report. This week, he had sent her a letter asking her to submit all reports.
He simply asked her to send in the reports, he did not mention stopping her salary, the minister said.
He further explained that as an advisor in the Ministry, she was considered a government servant who had to fulfil certain tasks attached to her job and could not simply draw a salary and not work, Earlier, she was an advisor to the minister and thus got away with not working, said Jayasekara.
Susanthika has gone through a lot to get here, so what I wanted was to use that experience and talent to motivate the next generation of athletes. I have no personal anger towards her but I am disappointed to say that she is someone with little gratitude. The Sports Ministry has spent much more money on her than any of the other athletes who have won medals. I cannot help it if she cannot manage her own finances, he added.
In addition to the Ministrys salary, Jayasinghe is also said to be drawing a salary of Rs.60,000 from the army to help them train their athletes.
The country at present does not have star class athletes who are good trainers. I asked her to be a trainer and the government will pay for that. She could be a very good trainer, but she is not interested, the minister said.
He further asked her to auction her medals to the Ministry and that he would gladly take them.

Leopard saved from Gampola estate
A hill country leopard facing death after getting caught in a wire mesh trap laid in a tea plantation in Angurumulla Millagahamula, Gampola was rescued by wildlife officers and veterinarians.
Earlier four leopards died getting caught in similar traps laid in this region. The rescued leopard a female of five feet was taken to the Nuwara Eliya wildlife office.
This particular leopard which had broken away from the trap with part of the wire strapped in the neck struck around tea bushes had been spotted by two tea pluckers who arrived in the morning.
After they alerted the neighbouring residents they had got in touch with an animal lover named Gunaratne who in turn had alerted the Zoologists Association of Sri Lanka. Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickreme Perera had intervened to dispatch the rescue team to save the life of the leopard.
Leopards straying into the estates very often get caught in wire traps laid by poachers with bicycle and three wheeler cables laid to hunt wild boar and other game.
The rescue Wildlife team was led by OIC Wimalaratne of the Nuwara Eliya Wildlife office together with veterinary surgeons Dr Kamani Dedunupitiya and Dr Yvonne Gunawardena.

Let them roam free
Poson Poya is devoted in Sri Lanka for commemorating the advent of Venerable Mahinda Thero to this country, Sri Lanka, to institute the dispensation of Lord Buddha or the Buddhasasana, which took place 2267 years ago (ie. 250 BC) on a Poson full moon day.
After Venerable Theros arrival in the country the intellectual conversation that took place between him and King Devanampiya Tissa, the then ruler of the country, on beautiful Mihintale rock is something which everyone in this country must mull over with a sensible mind, of cause, the literal meanings of the conversation was passed down from generation to generation in this country.
In one dialog which the great Thero had with King Devanampiya Tissa, the former uttered to the King, who had run into the thick forest where Mihintale rock was, on a deer hunting expedition, Oh! Great King, the birds of the air and the beasts on the earth have an equal right to live and move about in any part of this kingdom as thou. The land belongs to the people and all other living things, and thou art but the guardian of it"
This lofty utterance signifies not only everyones right to live but the freedom every being is entitled to. But, to what degree Sri Lankans, at least Buddhists, are fully cognizant of the meaning of this utterance is something to be weighed upon by Sri Lankan Buddhists themselves with a serious and compassionate mind, at least in this Poson season. As Buddhists, can we be happy about the status quo
Some people in this country who call themselves Buddhists think killing an animal is the act which breaks the first precept, the sin and the wrongdoing, off cause it is a sin and a wrongdoing which breaks the first precept.
But what about caging a bird, keeping a dog in a kennel, chaining an elephant until it gets festering wounds in the leg, forcefully making an elephant to take part in a pageant for many nights continuously, snatching a baby elephant from its helpless mother, depriving a feeble little calf of its mothers milk, keeping fish in a small tank and so on. Are they alright for a Buddhist  or acceptable within Buddhist principles. . Regrettably, those so called Buddhists have failed to think that such acts are sins, cruelties and unbecoming for Buddhists. Strangely, they dont know or consider that such acts violate the teachings of Load Buddha the most compassionate one.
To utter dismay, some Buddhist temples are no exceptions. Is it because, those who are dwelling in those temples are less concerned about what Venerable Mahinda Thero uttered on Mihintale rock on the very first day the great Thero set foot on this thrice blessed island to found Buddhasasana or they are less concerned of the very basic values of Buddhism  or something else Whatever it is, wrong is wrong which needs to be put right.
Thus, there is no other better time of the year than the Poson season for us, Sri Lankans, to think about this seriously and correct ourselves while celebrating this great Poson season with grandeur and piety.

Lyceum International School, the brainchild of prominent educationalist Mohan Lal Grero, will celebrate its 24th birthday in June. With eight branches in major cities, Lyceum is now considered to be the only school with the largest network of schools in the country, a press release by the school stated.
One of Greros prime objectives of setting up Lyceum, was to deliver affordable English medium education to the masses across the country, while developing the child through various extra-curricular activities as well as instilling children with a love for traditional cultures and value for all religions, races and societies.
This is the concept incorporated into every Lyceum branch across the island over the past two decades of its existence and is one of the reasons for its successful evolution through the years, the release added.
With the newest branch being established in Kurunegala less than a year ago, the school has seen a tremendous growth over this short period, which is no doubt due to the unconditional support received from our growing community of teachers, parents and students, the release stated.
In order to strengthen ties with the community and make awareness of Lyceum Kurunegala, the management of Lyceum Kurunegala will hold an Open Day, on June 15 at 4.30 pm at Lyceum International School, No. 71, Uduwalpola Rd, Kurunegala.

Meaning of suffering
As humans, we are always eager to explore all thoughts those pop up in our minds. At times we do not correctly identify the inapplicability of some thoughts and engage in them, just for the sake of short term happiness. For this reason we become so visionless in our behavior and make our own lives so miserable, in a longer perspective. Although the life is full of suffering such shortsightedness aggravates the sufferings and blocks the path to end suffering. Sometimes we take such blindness even in understanding the spiritual path to end suffering and set wrong priorities. As Buddhists, we sometimes forget, knowingly or unknowingly, that Buddha himself has set an example through his life for setting right priorities and ignoring undue concerns.
Cula-Malunkya sutta, sometimes referred to as Cula-Malunkyovada sutta, is a great source that teaches us why we should not follow the notions that would divert us away from the final goal and lead us to further suffering. Buddhists should always remember that the Buddha had only one clear and consistent message in his teachings for the sake of spiritual awakening and liberation: Nibbana, the end of suffering. Cula-Malunkya Sutta: The Shorter Instructions to Malunkya (Found in Majjhima Nikaya in Sutta pitaka of Tripitaka), is another sutta where the Buddha is challenged regarding the so called Great Questions of all times. In the dialogue found in this sutta, the Buddha consistently refuses to answer anything that would prove to be a diversion from the goal of the Eightfold Path, citing how such an act would only reinforce ignorance.
Today, we live in an educated society where everything is looked upon with a scientific approach. Madly, we want to know the exact nature of everything around us, believing, that would one day end our distress. The importance of this Sutta arises due to the fact that the un-awakened monk Malunkyaputta represents the modern intellectuals who are more interested in philosophical arguments based on a mechanistic approach than in personal development; self-centered speculative notions than in selfless people orientation. The Buddha, through his wisdom, realized and showed us the path of the true purpose of spiritual life, and what the real and immediate questions of life are. After going through the article one can clearly understand how the Buddha avoided explaining matters that are not connected with the spiritual path and the final goal for ending of suffering.
This sutta can also be considered as one which discourses the well-known ten undetermined views set aside by the Buddha due to their unexplainable nature and invalidity in the path to the final goal. The ten points are as follows, where the first 4 views are about the cosmos, next two are about the self or soul and the last four views are about Tathagata: 1) The cosmos is eternal. 2) The cosmos is not eternal. 3) The cosmos is finite. 4) The cosmos is infinite. 5) The self is the same as the body. 6) The self and the body are separate. 7) A being* [satta] exists after death. 8) A being does not exist after death. 9) A being both exists and does not exist after death. 10) A being neither exists nor not exist after death. (*In Pali this is referred to as tathagatha)
Cosmos
Although, these were declared as undetermined here, one should apprehend the fact that Tathagatha himself was aware of the answers to these questions and these were explained in different other suttas. Argument here is about the validity of such questions in the context of life that we spend and not about the questions, per say.
One of the Monks of the Sangha, Malunkyaputta, when in isolation in the Jetawanaramaya, Anathapindikas monastery, these thought occurred to him; There are speculative views those have been left unanswered by the Blessed One, namely: The cosmos is eternal, the cosmos is not eternal, the cosmos is finite, the cosmos is infinite. Also, self (or soul) is the same as the body. The self and the body are separate. On the other hand, a being exists after death. A being does not exist after death. A being both exists and does not exist after death. A being neither exists nor does not exist after death.
The monk was confused and went and met the Blessed one to clarify them so that his questions are answered. After paying homage to the Buddha, he sat down at one side and said: Bhante, the following thought arose in my mind. These speculative views have been left undetermined and set aside by the Blessed One. He then put forward the 10 great questions and said, If the Buddha does not declare them for me, then I will give up being a monk and return to the normal life.
He then reiterated those questions challenging the Buddha, If the Blessed One knows the cosmos is eternal, then, let the Blessed One declare to me, The cosmos is eternal or, if the Blessed One knows the cosmos is not eternal, then, let the Blessed One declare to me, The cosmos is not eternal. If the Blessed One does not know: the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal, then, it is only honest for one who neither knows nor see to say, I do not know, I do not see.
Blessed
Then he went to his second question and said If the Blessed One knows the cosmos is finite, then, let the Blessed One declare to me, or if the Blessed One knows the cosmos is infinite then, let the Blessed One declare to me. If the Blessed One does not know the cosmos is finite or the cosmos is infinite, then, it is only honest for one who neither knows nor see to say, I do not know, I do not see
Venerable Malunkkya went along the same line of argument for other theses as well, one by one.

The Health Ministry tried its best to prevent communicable diseases in flood affected areas. No health issue has been reported from flood affected areas, Health Services acting Director General Dr. J.M.W.Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing the media at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said treatment was available to needy persons. Medicines were provided to those who were on regular medications for diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Drugs were issued to required persons to prevent rat fever.
According to Dr. Bandara, allergic conditions were reported from some dengue patients who had been given Dextran 40 imported from India. The use of the drug was stopped after a few incidents. Dextran 40 imported from Thailand is being used for dengue patients. An order has been placed for Dextran 40 requirement for the next year.
Measures will be taken to prevent breeding of dengue mosquitoes in flood affected areas under the three month dengue control programme launched on June 1 under the direction of President Maithripala Sirisena, Bandara said.

Nadal wary of Thiems huge potential
Paris: Rafael Nadal warned of the threat presented by Dominic Thiems huge potential ahead of their clash for a place in Sundays French Open final.
The Spaniard qualified for the semi-finals at Roland Garros for the 10th time on Wednesday after compatriot Pablo Carreno Busta retired with an abdominal injury while trailing 6-2, 2-0.
Thiem is the only player to defeat Nadal on clay this season and sealed a return to the last four in Paris with a sensational 7-6 (7/5), 6-3, 6-0 upset of defending champion Novak Djokovic.
Fridays semi-final will be the fourth meeting between Nadal and Thiem this season, all of which have come on clay.
Thiem is a tough player. I won in Barcelona, Madrid, and I lost to him in Rome, said Nadal, who is attempting to become the first man to win 10 titles at a single Grand Slam.
So either you play well and you advance to the next round or you lose and youre out.
Nadal beat the Austrian to lift the trophy in both Madrid and Barcelona, but Thiem exacted a measure of revenge with a 6-4, 6-3 win over the 31-year-old at the Rome Masters.
In Rome it was not a good day for me. I was not in a position to play well the way I wanted to, recounted Nadal.
He put me in a difficult situation, so its up to me to avoid being put in uncomfortable situations.
Thiem downed Djokovic for his first win in six matches against the Serb and is through to just his second semi-final at a major.
Hes a very good player. He hits the ball very hard. Hes very powerful on both sides. Forehand, backhand, serve. These weapons are quite good, said Nadal of his upcoming opponent.
He has a huge potential to tap, and he can hit the ball very hard. He doesnt give you a lot of options.
Neither Nadal nor Thiem have dropped a set in reaching the last four, with the Spaniard losing just 22 games through five matches.
Bjorn Borg surrendered just 32 games on his way to the 1978 French Open, but Nadal insisted he has no interest in such records.
I dont know how many games I lost this year, but I really dont care about this. I only care that I am in the semi-finals, said Nadal.
My only goal is try to be ready to play my best. The rest of these things, we can always find behind the stones.
Were going to find more and more records, but at the end of the day these kind of things are not important.
Pliskova into first French
Open semis
Paris: Czech second seed Karolina Pliskova reached the French Open semi-finals for the first time on Wednesday with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-4 win over home hope Caroline Garcia.
Pliskova will play 2014 Roland Garros runner-up Simona Halep, who saved a match point and rallied from 6-3, 5-1 down to beat Elina Svitolina, in the last four.AFP

In the name of rituals
A religion that worships aircraft was started by a group of people who saw their first plane fly over Vanuatu, a remote island in the South Pacific of Australia, during the Second World War.
After the planes delivered food and supplies to the islanders, the group of people in Vanuatu began to believe that cargo would be brought to them by a god. Consequently, whenever they saw a plane fly overhead, they would build a replica of a plane in the hope of more foods. The islanders did not know where the objects were coming from; which led them to believe that the objects derived from heaven. It is a religion now in Vanuatu. This Cargo Religion was first discovered in 1946 by Australian government patrols, and there are still a few but a diverse number of cargo religions left.
Notably, one of the cargo sects is referred to as the John Frum movement because they believe John Frum, a seemingly fictional First World War serviceman, is the Messenger sent from heaven.
Dr Richard Feynman, an astrophysicist, described this cult in a 1974 paper, he said: During the war, the cargo religious people in this island saw aeroplanes land with lots of good materials, foods etc, and they want the same thing to happen even now. So they've arranged to imitate things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas  he's the controller  and even now they wait for the airplanes to land.
They're doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn't work. No aeroplanes land. So we can call these things as Cargo Cult science because they follow all the apparent Precepts of scientific investigation, but they're missing something essential because the planes don't land.
Maybe our rituals practising now in the name of Buddhism can be a similar cult because we also try to follow the Precepts investigated scientifically by the Buddha using a theory called Patichcha Samuppada. This Theory in its original format is also available in written form in a book called Tripitaka. We also build temples, listen to Damma Instructions, and follow rituals. However, something essential is missing namely the appearance of Virtuous Society and enlightened people.
As I heard, more than 20% of the population in the area where Buddha was born was reaping its real benefits, at that time. What may be the reason for it is not so now Is it not a practical religion Or else do our Masters interpret the Buddhist Theory in Tripitaka, not in its right spirit
May somebody explain this dilemma, please

No pressure on underdogs Sri Lanka says Mathews
London: Angelo Mathews insists there is no pressure on Sri Lanka in their crucial Champions Trophy clash against India on Thursday because the defending champions are expected to thrash his underdogs.
Mathews side must beat India at The Oval to keep alive their hopes of reaching the semi-finals, but the odds are against a Sri Lanka team hit by injury and suspension.
Sri Lanka looked like tournament also rans when they lost to South Africa by 96 runs in their Group B opener last weekend.
Already in the midst of a rebuilding project following the retirement of several stars, Sri Lanka will be without Upul Tharanga, banned for his teams slow over rate, against India, while batsman Chamara Kapugedera may miss out due to injury.
Mathews knows India, who thrashed Pakistan in their first group match, are firm favourites to maintain their 100 percent record.
But the Sri Lanka captain hopes being written off will allow his team to play with enough freedom to spring a surprise.
People will want India to come in and thrash us, and its just all the pressure is off us, Mathews told a press conference at The Oval on Wednesday.
We are happy to walk in as the underdogs. I mean, no one really expects us to win the championship. Which takes a lot of pressure out of the guys.
We just have to go out there, just express ourselves and be aggressive.
That is our brand of cricket, being aggressive and positive.
Tharangas absence is a blow for Sri Lanka and Mathews, who missed the South Africa match due to a calf injury, pulled no punches as he slammed the stand-in skipper and his team-mates for failing to keep up with the required over rate.
The over rate was an issue. It was pathetic. I call it pathetic because of the whole team, and the captain was warned several times, and theres no excuse at all but to take responsibility for that because nobody else can take responsibility on it, Mathews said.
The whole team is responsible, including the captain. Its a very hard job on the field, and he has to look into so many things.
The rest of the players has to support them. Most of the teams play with four seamers and they have not had an issue.
We played only three and weve had an issue. That has been addressed and it will not happen again.
While Mathews is aware he is in charge of a largely inexperienced group still finding their way on the international stage, he expects them to rise to the challenge sooner rather than later.
The guys are learning every single day. If you look at most of the guys, they havent played a lot of international cricket, he said.
The more you play, the more you learn. Everyone has to step up with their roles because we cant just expect things to fall in line.
Weve got to make it happen, and weve got to make it happen soon.
It might be hard to see too many signs of progress against the might of India and Mathews, who will return to the line-up as a batsman but may not bowl, conceded Virat Kohlis group are formidable.
Theyre a force in world cricket no matter where they play. Theyve played fantastic cricket over so many years, he said.
Its very hard to beat them unless we are on top of our game.
We will all have to pull our socks up and give a great performance. AFP

Non-violence, compassion take centre stage in Poson
Poson message:
The visit of Arahat Mahinda to Sri Lanka heralded in a new chapter in the countrys history, with the hallowed principles of non-violence and compassion as enshrined in Buddhism, taking centre stage, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
It not only transformed the Sri Lankan way of life but also made a strong impact on our social discourse; agriculture, hydro civilisation, cultural pursuits and governance were some of the key areas that were influenced by Buddhist values and traditions.
Today, Sri Lanka is recognised as a strategic centre for Theravada Buddhism, the principles of which have been central to its people and their way of thinking. As a result, we have had the honour of hosting the International Vesak Festival and the International Buddhist Congress.
May the true doctrine of Buddhism, its compassion and non-violent principles encourage us to live in harmony and peaceful co-existance, while respecting other religions and other cultures.
This Poson, may we be able to set our hearts and minds to making such a vision a reality,the Premier said in his Poson message.

## Title: Nourishing the roots

Nourishing the roots
The course of spiritual training taught by the Buddha is a double process of self-transformation and self-transcendence issuing in complete emancipation from suffering. The process of self-transformation involves the elimination of unwholesome mental dispositions and their replacement by pure dispositions conducing to the benefit of oneself and others; the process of self-transcendence focuses on the abandoning of egocentric notions by seeing with direct insight the essenceless nature of the bodily and mental processes we normally take to be "I" and "mine." When this double process is brought to its culmination, suffering is extinguished, for with the awakening of wisdom the basic root of suffering  craving backed by blinding ignorance  falls away never to rise again.
Because the unwholesome tendencies and selfish clinging spring from seeds buried deep in the bottom-most strata of the mind, to eradicate these sources of affliction and nurture the growth of the liberating vision of reality the Buddha presents his teaching in the form of a gradual training. Buddhist discipline involves gradual practice and gradual attainment. It does not burst into completeness at a stroke, but like a tree or any other living organism, it unfolds organically, as a sequence of stages in which each stage rests upon its predecessor as its indispensable foundation and gives rise to its successor as its natural consequent. The principal stages of this gradual training are three: the training in sila or virtue, the training in samadhi or concentration, and the training in paa or wisdom. If we follow through the comparison of the Buddhist discipline to a tree, faith (saddha) would be the seed, for it is faith that provides the initial impulse through which the training is taken up, and faith again that nourishes the training through every phase of its development. Virtue would be the roots, for it is virtue that gives grounding to our spiritual endeavours just as the roots give grounding to a tree. Concentration would be the trunk, the symbol of strength, non-vacillation, and stability. And wisdom would be the branches, which yield the flowers of enlightenment and the fruits of deliverance.
The vigour of the spiritual life, like the vigour of a tree, depends upon healthy roots. Just as a tree with weak and shallow roots cannot flourish but will grow up stunted, withered and barren, so a spiritual life devoid of strong roots will also have a stunted growth incapable of bearing fruit. To attempt to scale the higher stages of the path it is essential at the outset to nourish the proper roots of the path; otherwise the result will be frustration, disillusionment, and perhaps even danger.
The roots of the path are the constituents of sila, the factors of moral virtue. These are the basis for meditation, the ground for all wisdom and higher achievement.
Principles of right conduct
To say that sila is the precondition for success, however, does not mean, as is too often believed in conservative Buddhist circles, that one cannot begin to meditate until one's sila is perfect. Such a stipulation would make it almost impossible to start meditation, since it is the mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom of the meditative process that bring about the gradual purification of virtue. But to say that virtue is the basis of practice does mean that the capacity for achievement in meditation hinges upon the purity of our sila.
If our roots of virtue are weak, our meditation will likewise be weak. If our actions repeatedly clash with the basic principles of right conduct, our attempts to control the mind in the discipline of meditation will turn into a self-defeating enterprise, since the springs of our conduct will be the same defiled states of mind the meditation is intended to eliminate.
Buddhist discipline
Only when we secure our cultivation upon the foundation of blameless principles of right action can the inward endeavour of meditation prosper and issue in success.
With true principles of conduct as the base, the roots of virtue will give birth to the trunk of concentration, the concentrated mind shoot forth the branches of wisdom, and the branches of wisdom yield the flowers and fruits of enlightenment, culminating in total freedom from bondage. Therefore, just as a skillful gardener brings a sapling to growth by first tending to the roots, so the earnest seeker of enlightenment should begin his cultivation by tending to the roots of his practice  that is, to his sila or moral virtue.
The Pali word sila originally meant simply conduct. But in the context of the Buddhist spiritual training the term is used to signify only a specific kind of conduct, i.e., good conduct, and by an extension of meaning, the type of character for which such conduct stands, i.e., good character. Hence sila means both moral conduct, a body of habits governed by moral principles, and moral virtue, the interior quality the regular observance of these principles is intended to produce.
Both shades of meaning are essential to understand the place of sila in the spectrum of Buddhist discipline. Sila in the former sense consists in the non-transgression through body or speech of the basic precepts regulating the moral life. It is moral discipline in deed and word, beginning as the inhibition of immoral impulses seeking an outlet through body and speech, and developing into the habitual conformation to the principles of righteous conduct. But the full range of sila is not exhausted by mere outward behavioral control, for the term has in addition a deeper, more psychological significance. In this second sense sila is moral purity, the inner purification of character which results from a life consistently moulded upon moral principles. This aspect of sila places the stress on the subjective, motivational side of action. It looks not towards the outward act itself, but towards the rectitude of mind from which good conduct springs.
Upon inspection sila thus reveals itself to be a two- dimensional quality: it contains an external dimension consisting in purification of conduct, and an internal dimension consisting in purification of character. However, in the Teaching of the Buddha, these two dimensions of experience, the internal and the external, are not torn apart and consigned to separate, self-sufficient domains. They are recognized, rather, to be two facets of a single whole, complementary poles of a unified field which mirror one another, implicate one another, and penetrate one another with their own respective potentialities of influence. Actions performed by body and speech are not, from the Buddhist standpoint, so many detachable appendages of a distinct spiritual essence, but concrete revelations of the states of mind which stand behind them as their activating source. And states of mind, in turn, do not remain closed up in a purely mental isolation, but spill forth according to the play of circumstances from the fountain of consciousness where they arise, through the channels of body, speech and thought, out into the world of inter-personally significant events.
From the action we can infer the state of mind, and from the state of mind we can predict the probable course of action. The relationship between the two is as integral as that between a musical score and its orchestrated performance on the concert stage.
Because of this mutual dependence of the two domains, moral conduct and purity of character lock up with one another in a subtle and complex interrelationship. The fulfillment of the purification of virtue requires that both aspects of sila be realized: on the one side, behavior of body and speech must be brought into accord with the moral ideal; on the other, the mental disposition must be cleansed of its corruptions until it is impeccably pure. The former without the latter is insufficient; the latter without the former is impossible.
Between the two, the internal aspect is the more important from the standpoint of spiritual development, since bodily and verbal deeds acquire ethical significance primarily as expressions of a corresponding disposition of mind. In the sequence of spiritual training, however, it is moral discipline that comes first. For at the beginning of training, purification of character stands as an ideal which must be reached; it is not a reality with which one can start.
Human nature
According to the Buddhist principle of conditionality, the actualization of any given state is only possible through the actualization of its appropriate conditions, and this applies as much to the achievement of the various stages of the training as to the bare phenomena of matter and mind. Since beginning less time the consciousness-continuum has been corrupted by the unwholesome roots of greed, hatred and delusion; it is these defilements which have functioned as the source for the greatest number of our thoughts, the ground for our habits, and the springs for our actions and general orientation towards other people and the world as a whole. To uproot these defiling afflictions at a single stroke and reach the peak of spiritual perfection by a mere act of will is a well-near impossible task. A realistic system of spiritual training must work with the raw material of human nature; it cannot rest content merely with postulated paragons of human excellence or demands for achievement without showing the method by which such demands can be realized.
The Buddha rests his teaching upon the thesis that with the right method we have the capacity to change and transform ourselves. We are not doomed to be for ever burdened by the weight of accumulated tendencies, but through our own effort we can cast off all these tendencies and attain a condition of complete purity and freedom. When given the proper means in the context of right understanding, we can bring about radical alterations in the workings of consciousness and mould a new shape out of the seemingly immutable stuff of our own minds.
The first step on this path is the purification of character, and the efficient means for the restructuring of character the Buddha provides in the observance of sila as a set of precepts regulating bodily and verbal conduct. Sila as moral discipline, in other words, becomes the means for inducing sila as moral virtue. The effectiveness of this measure stems from the reciprocal interlocking of the internal and external spheres of experience already referred to. Because the inner and outer domains are mutually implicated, the one can become the means for producing deep and lasting changes in the other. Just as a state of mind expresses itself outwardly in an action  in deed or speech  so too the avoidance and performance of certain actions can recoil upon the mind and alter the basic disposition of the mental life. If mental states dominated by greed and hatred can engender deeds of killing, stealing, lying, etc., then the abstinence on principle from killing, stealing and lying can engender a mental disposition towards kindliness, contentment, honesty and truthfulness. Thus, although sila as moral purity may not be the starting point of spiritual training, conformity to righteous standards of conduct can make it an attainable end. To page 14

Objections to 23 FFSL nominations
Twenty three nominees including presidential candidates Ranjith Rodrigo and Anura de Silva were challenged with objections questioning their eligibility to be elected for the forthcoming Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) office bearers. The Sports Ministry drew the dead line for objections by 1.00pm yesterday. The Football Election Committee headed by Deputy Sports Director R. B. Wickremasinghe will announce their decisions after considering the objections tomorrow. The aggrieved individuals can appeal to the Sports Ministry until June 13. The FFSL election is due to held on July 1.
A serious allegation was leveled against a presidential candidate where documents were submitted along with the objection to prove that he has been deported from Japan to Sri Lanka after staying four years in Japan without visa. The objection also stated that he went missing after watching the Football World Cup in japan and appointing such a law-breaker for the FFSL top spot will bring disgrace to the country.
Another objection demanded that all candidates must have played football and there is one who has never played the game. A candidate for the secretary post, Trevor Rekaman was challenged, stating the document he submitted from a sports club to prove that he has played football is a forged one.

Once Upon a long time ago
A young man was born ages ago, in a time of spiritual darkness (abuddhassa), with no Teacher (sammasambuddha), to point the way out of the cycle of life and death (samsara), which only brought sorrow, to all sentient beings.
He had felt his mind vibrate, seeking release out of this trap. For countless births, he had practised sense discipline and mind-control, and intuitively felt that now, the goal was within his grasp. So he left home and family and sat in deep meditation out in the forest, exploring with his inner eye, the cosmos and the far reaches of the universe.
His mind travelled through Island Universes, spanning incalculable distances, sensing the minutest details of samsara, namely the Dance of Life and Death, and again Life, and again Death, and so on, in a ceaseless cycle.
Happiness, Unhappiness and Decay, came between these two major events. Everywhere his mind went, he was attracted and perturbed by what he sensed and saw. Many hours were spent in incessantly going forth and coming back to his inert body, sitting under a tree.
He visited various star systems, pausing here and there to examine the worlds of strange sentient beings trapped in samsara, all suffering from ease and dis-ease. The governing forces that kept them in bondage were Greed, Impermanence and the Ego.
Eventually, his wandering mind settled down gently in his body. Realisation came that samsara, in its many facets existed right here, within his own self, in the tandem which was his body and mind, the psycho-soma. Ideas that were tenuously coagulated.
He inhaled and exhaled slowly and lightly.
Comprehension arose as to the complex nature of samsara, the constant interchange between life and death. Sometimes Life lasted only for a few minutes or stretched to days, months, years or even to aeons, but always ended in Death, to start the cycle again. Happiness in this phenomenal state was eclipsed by lamentation and despair, suffered by all living beings. Sansara was always in a condition of flux. Attachment to phenomena, therefore brought only suffering to both the mind and the body.
He still sat in meditation.
Knowledge and wisdom arose in him. Serenity pervaded his mind. The highest enlightenment (sambodhi), was achieved. He knew that the release of his mind from all defilements will not be disturbed (akkupa me chetovimuktti), by any condition.
Nirvana, the non-phenomenal state of mind was attained. He was free both from happiness, and unhappiness. There would never be a rebirth for him in this sorrowful samsara!
His aspect was passionless. Around him, a halo radiated in ever widening circles, bright and clear, which no one other than he could see, because, though he was released from all suffering, he could never teach the Path to Nirvana, as he was not a Sammasambuddha. In this time of Abuddhassa, he was a Silent Buddha, able only to help himself.
He teleported to Isigili Mountain and vanished into it, never to come out again, thus becoming one of the 500 Silent Buddhas, enumerated by Gautama Sammasambuddha, ages later, in the Isigili Sutta.

JO playing opportunistic politics: Kiriella
The opportunistic politics that the Joint Opposition(JO) indulges is clearly visible by the fact that its leader makes statements against the SAITM while the gazette of the same medical faculty had been presented by him during the previous regime, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said in Parliament yesterday.
He said that it was Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena who presented the gazette of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) on December 11, 2013.
It was set up in 2009 and University Grant Commission had accepted it in 2011 as an institution which conducts courses for MBBS, Minister Kiriella said.
The previous government granted a loan of Rs.600 million and granted scholarships to follow medicine courses. But now MP Gunawardena is speaking against the same.
This is clearly the opportunistic politics maintained by the JO.
Minister Kiriella made these observations in response to a special statement made by MP
Dinesh Gunawardena under Standing Orders 23 stating that continuing with the SAITM as a medical faculty was illegal and it was set up as an institute of technology and management.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara questioned as to how scholarships were granted to SAITM for medicine if it were a Technology and Management institute.
Minister Kiriella further said that the Mahapola scholarship could not be granted to those medical students who stage Satyagraha without attending the university lectures.
Former Minister Lalith Athulathmudali introduced the Mahapola Scholarship for University students, Minister Kiriella said.
Does Gunawardena ask to grant scholarships to the students who dont attend the university. We cant grant Mahapola Scholarships to those who dont attend university,the Minister said.
At this stage, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that the request to grant Mahapola scholarship to the students who dont attend the university tantamount to paying Parliamentary attending allowances to those MPs who dont attend parliamentary sittings.
Akila vows stern action against corrupt Archaeological Dept. officials
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said he would take stern action against some more officials in the Archaeological Department, who were allegedly involved in corrupt acts over the past years.
The minister made this comment while making a special Ministerial Statement in Parliament yesterday on the removal of Dr. Senerath Dissanayake from the post of Director General of Archaeological Department.
The minister said Dr.Dissanayake who was the Archaeological Department DG for 13 years
from 2004 has to take the responsibility for the present plight of the archaeological heritage in the country.
He said Dissanayakes removal was a collective Cabinet decision, adding that he (Dissanayake) has been given space to reply to the charge sheet sent to him.
He said the DG has done little to stop unauthorized constructions in world heritage sites such as Galle Fort and Dambulla Cave temple, adding that the UNESCO warned of removing them from the World Heritage status due to this reason.
He also said the Department has failed to properly identify and mark the boundaries of archaeological sites in the North and East eventhough eight have lapsed since the terrorist war ended. He said the recent trend of the destruction of archaeological sites was due to the absence of proper conversation mechanism.
About 80 percent of the high ranking posts in the Department have not been filled for many years. The inefficiency of the Department is proven beyond doubt. I have no personal dispute with the DG. Several newspapers and web based media carried false news over the decision to remove Dissanayake. I have not made any request to release any land coming under the Archaeological Department for any construction, the minister clarified.
The minister said Prof P B Mandawala has been appointed as acting DG of the Archaeological Department.
Sports Act to be reintroduced as a new Act: Minister
The Sports Act will be reintroduced as a completely new Act, said Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara in Parliament yesterday. The Minister made this observation moving orders under the Sports Act.
He also said that some outdated provisions needed to be updated while important changes needed to be made to the act to meet the needs of the present. He added that a committee has been appointed for the task.
He also said the new Act would ensure the independence of sports associations and seek to eliminate political influences over Sports associations.
He pointed out that as a result, Sports Associations would have financial responsibilities and will have to be managed in a transparent manner.
He added that recommendations and advice had been sought from the International Olympic
Committee as well as the Sri Lanka Olympic Committee on methods to improve the Sports Act.
He also said that the existing Sports Act had been passed in 1963 and it should be changed.
Fill GN officer vacancies based on competitive examination results: Anura Kumara
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake queried as to why the Government is not filling the existing Grama Niladari(GN) Officer vacancies based on the results of competitive examination held last year.
He charged while those who sat for the competitive exam were waiting their results for months, the Government has made plans to recall the retired Grama Niladari Officers back to service.
The MP was raising a question under Standing Order 23 (2) in Parliament yesterday.
About 180,000 candidates sat for the exam held in September last year. The Examinations Department had completed marking the papers by April, but the Home Affairs Ministry has not taken the results from the Department, he said.
In the meantime, the Ministers private secretary has been collecting recommendation letters from UNP Parliamentarians to fill the existing vacancies from retired Grama Niladari Officers. This is unfair for those who sat for the exam. These political recommendations are not suitable for the independence of the post of Grama Niladari Officer. The Government should immediately abandon this plan, MP Dissanayake said.
Replying to this question Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said the extension of services of retiring Grama Niladari Officers was proposed in view of the recent disaster in the country. About 5,700 Grama Niladari Divisions out of 14,000 were affected by the recent disaster situation. Therefore we decided to extend the service of retiring officers for another three months. However, once an appointment is made based on the competitive exam, the service of those retired officers will be cancelled, he said.
The minister said the delay in recruiting persons based on the exam was due to a proposal of Grama Niladari Officers Associations to consider filling 50 percent of the existing vacancies with males and rest of 50 percent with females.
The Association came up with this request stating that about 80 percent of individuals who would be selected from the exam would be female. Our ministry was not inclined towards this proposal as we were of the view that gender based recruitment was not suitable and that the recruitment should be based on the marks only, the minister explained.
The minister said there are 1,725 vacancies in the Grama Niladari Officer cadre as of May 30. However, MP Dissanayake said he could not agree with the reply of the Minister that the decision to recruit the retired Grama Niladari Officers was due to the disaster.
The letter communicating this decision was issued in April 24. The flood havoc came in May. Going by the reply of the minister, he seems to have foreseen the disaster. If that is so, the minister is best suited to hold the Disaster Management portfolio, the MP remarked.
Heated argument between Speaker, JO
A heated argument broke out between Joint Opposition(JP) members and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in Parliament yesterday following the special statement made by JO Parliamentary Group leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
As the Joint Opposition
members started to shout when the Speaker announced that nobody could be allowed to express their views other than the member who moved the special statement under Standing Order 23 (2) and the responding Minister, the Speaker warned the members that he would have to name members.
I will have to name member Ranjith de Soysa if you keep on threatening and pointing your finger at the Chair, warned the Speaker. This is not a Pradeshiya Sabha to act in a such a manner. All the members who were on their feet should sit down. All members should realiase the fact that this is an august assembly,Speaker Jayasuriya said. When MP Dinesh Gunawardena refuted the response by Minister Kiriella that the Gazette of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) had been presented to Parliament by MP Gunawardena, Minister Kiriella sent a copy of the Hanzard to the Speaker/. The Speaker said that the copy was the proceedings of the Parliamentary sittings of December 11, 2013.
MP Gunawardena moving the special statement said that around 6,000 medical students in government medical faculties boycott the lectures as the government has failed to fulfill their demand to ensure a process of producing quality doctors. He added that their boycott of lectures has reached 500 days which they started against the SAITM.
He questioned if the government would heed the medical students demand and to grant the Mahapola Scholarship which has been held to those medical students.
After Minister Kiriellas response, MP Gunawardena said that the SAITM Medical Faculty was illegal and same is not accepted by Minister Kiriella.
Point Pedro to house countrys largest fisheries harbour: Minister Amaraweera
The largest fisheries harbour in the country will come up in Point Pedro, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The minister made this comment while replying to a question by UPFA MP Douglas Devananda under Standing Order 23 (2) in Parliament yesterday.
The minister said two fisheries harbours would be built in Pesali and Point Pedro to develop the fisheries industry in the North.
He said the Asian Development Bank has agreed to provide funds for this project.
Prior to 1983, there was about 40 percent contribution from the Northern fishermen to the local fish production. It drastically dropped to 4 percent from 1983 to 2009 due to war, he said.
This contribution is about 12 percent as of today and this is not satisfactory. The fishermen in the North are still using traditional fishing methods and their vessels are very old. Compared with the South, the fishing industry in the North is lagging behind 20-30 years. Now we are transferring modern technology to them, he said.
He added a team from the Moratuwa University recently carried out a feasibility study in Point Pedro on the proposed construction.
Replying to MP Devanandas question over public protests on the proposed project, the minister said he would visit the area and hold discussions with the people on resolving their issues concerning the project.
Our officials discussed with the fisheries association representatives and they could iron out most of their doubts. Now many in the area are supporting this project. If we have to acquire private lands for the purpose, we will pay due compensation. The Construction of fishery harbour will generate a large number of direct and indirect jobs. We do not intend to recruit those in the South for them. It is the Northern community who will be fully benefited by this initiative, the minister explained.
The minister also said the proposed Aquaculture Industrial Park extending to about 3,000 acres in Mannar would generate about 10,000 jobs.
Country to ban tobacco cultivation from 2020, says Rajitha
Tobacco cultivation will be completely banned in the country from 2020, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne said.
The minister was responding to a question by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana in Parliament yesterday. The minister, observing that about 30,000 persons are currently involved in tobacco cultivation, said a programme is in place to introduce alternative crops to them.
He said the sale of cigarettes within a 500 metre radius of schools would also be banned, adding that the Cabinet approved the proposal in this regard recently.
Minister Senaratne added the sale of single cigarettes would also be banned shortly, adding that this proposal also received the Cabinet approval.
Thereafter,if anybody wants to buy a cigarette, he should buy a carton. Plain packaging will also be introduced in the near future.
All these steps are intended to discourage smoking. Sri Lanka received the accolades of the World Health Organisation for the stiff action taken by the Government to discourage smoking, he said.
The minister further said tobacco and liquor companies are not allowed to carry out Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects as per the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) Act. However, he pointed out steps to discourage liquor consumption should be initiated by the Finance Ministry, as it falls under the Finance Ministrys purview.
Susanthika instructed to submit a progress report on payment: Sports Minister
Sprinter Susanthika Jayasinghe has been instructed to submit a progress report that is required to continue the payment that she is paid as an adviser to the Sports Ministry, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara told Parliament yesterday.
He said that submission of the report is compulsory and the Audit is querying as to why and how she is being paid without the report being submitted by her.
This has been misunderstood by some, the Minister said.
However she has been instructed to meet the additional Secretary (Administration) and to submit the report in order to get her payment. She is being paid Rs 60,000 from the Sports Ministry and another Rs 60,000 from the Sri Lanka Army. The Government is paying her a sum of Rs. 120,000 to Susanthika Jayasinghe.
The Minister also said that he was of the view that Susanthika should be paid a pension as the members suggested. And there are other athletes such as Sriyani Kulawansa, Damayanthi Darsha, Sugath Thilakaratne, etc who have obtained medals at the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games which is also a great achievement, Minister Jayasekara said.
He also said that the proposal to grant a vehicle permit could be considered. The Minister made these observations yesterday in response to members who spoke on the orders under the Sports Act.
The Minister said that 100 sports graduates would be recruited in future. There is a programme to develop sports in schools, he said.
The Ministry is getting ready for the Asian and Commonwealth Games. The athletes in the pool are being trained. They are provided with food and payments.
He added that there is a plan to develop the Diyagama Stadium and Rs.500 million has been allocated for this purpose.

Peoples Bank to raise Rs 5 bn to meet Central Bank regulations
The government will infuse a capital of Rs 5 billion into Peoples Bank to help it meet the Central Banks new regulatory capital requirements.
The Peoples Bank established in 1961 has over Rs 1.4 trillion in consolidated assets. Domestically it is the second largest and accounts for 15 percent of banking sector assets, advances and customer deposits with 18 million customer accounts.
Since 2008 however, the bank has received no new capital from the government while it paid an aggregate Rs 34.9 billion in dividends since 2008.
The Central Bank is expected to introduce a new set of Basel III reforms to strengthen regulation, supervision and risk of the banking sector with effect from July 7, 2017 onwards.
The framework imposes higher capital adequacy and other more stringent risk control measures for all Banks. This has necessitated all Financial Institutions, including Peoples Bank, raise their regulatory capital from current levels. In addition, the framework also imposes a Leverage Ratio requirement of 4 percent. This is to be in force and effect from January 1, 2018, stated the cabinet paper on Peoples Bank and further added,
Peoples Banks current regulatory capital shortfall(s) to meet the new requirements are in excess Rs 20 billion over the next three year period.The Bank is in the process of undertaking several initiatives with the objects of bridging this shortfall, in close coordination with the Ministry of Public Enterprise Development and Ministry of Finance, the new capital infusion at this juncture is requisite and necessary.

Police headquarters acting on the instructions of IGP Pujith Jayasundera, has deployed Police lifesaving units and volunteer lifesaving teams near main tanks and water bodies in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Dambulla and the beach in Tangalle.
This is for the safety of pilgrims bathing in them during the Poson season from June 6 to 11. The lifeguards are trained by Regional Police Instructors.
Police Headquarters in a press release said bathers in these water bodies should pay special attention to the following factors to ensure their safety.
"Pay attention to the warning signs set up near tanks and other water bodies, follow instructions given by lifesavers in using water bodies, use areas designated as 'safe' for bathing, avoid wading into water after liquor, prevent bathing during night and at spots infested with crocodiles, use lifesaving jackets during boat travel, and check whether the coxswain has a valid licence, avoid wading into the water near the sluice gate or spots with a heavy current, be extremely careful in using areas with water since digging had been carried out to obtain water during drought, and keep an awareness about the number of the group entering the water body for bathing and doing a headcount on return to the banks to ensure all are safe," the release stated.

Poson unveiled path to Panchasheela - President
Poson message:
As the disciples who listened to the Buddhist teachings for the first time under a mango tree, our determination on this noble Poson full moon day should be to commit ourselves to make a better world through the discipline of mind, body and word, President Maithripala Sirisena said in his Poson day message.
We commenced our journey through a new civilization on the day King Devanampiya Thissa ended the game of deer hunting in Mihintale. With the king who relinquished the bow and arrow on that day, our nation accessed into a path of a new life guided through the concept of Panchasheela, non-violence, compassion and loving-kindness.
On that day we not only received the heritage of a new doctrine, but also the gift of an enriched civilization, education, literature, architecture, agriculture as well as the livelihood traditions of the contemporary Mauryan Kingdom of Bharat.
Hence, the dawn of Poson full moon day and the arrival of Arhat Mahinda was the historic phenomenon that gave birth to our new future. That is how the site of Mihintale became the lap of our Motherland.
Thus, our way of life was bound to a non-violent principle extended not only to human beings but also to the animals. It resulted in the declaration of the first animal sanctuary in the world. The guidance we were offered by Buddhism to live with a close relationship with the environment was a prime fact of our safe existence.
It was when we deviated from the teachings of the Buddha that nature threatened us in return. The Agganna Sutta in Digha Nikaya explains the harm that can occur when the mutual relationship between nature and humans is fractured. It states that when humans act against nature due to their greed, they themselves will have to face the adverse repercussions.

Privileged to practise
Preached by the Buddha (c. 563-483 BC), Buddhism is one of the great religions of the world. As Karl Marx perceptively judged, among other things, religion is the generalized theory of this world, its encyclopedic compendium, its logic in popular form. Theories about the world, whether they are religious, philosophical, scientific or just fanciful in origin, all seek to account for the incredible diversity and intricate complexity of the phenomenon of life on earth. Historically, convention has privileged religious theories against critical evaluation, but increasingly and irreverently all theories about the world including the God-hypothesis have become subject to critical empirical scrutiny.
Religion, philosophy and science are aspects of humankinds ceaseless attempt to solve existential problems. Their concerted, dedicated objective is knowledge of the world we find ourselves in, not knowing whence we came nor why nor whither we shall go. The most useful knowledge would provide us with an understanding of the world as it really is. According to the Buddha, too, the senses should be cultivated to see the truth, to see things as they really are. Such knowledge is necessary for human beings to pursue with any hope of success the goals of survival of themselves and their kind in this world, avoidance of suffering and attainment of happiness.
Stream entry
The Pali Canon recognizes four levels of Awakening, the first of which is called stream entry. This gains its name from the fact that a person who has attained this level has entered the stream flowing inevitably to nibbana. He/she is guaranteed to achieve full awakening.
This book explains the way to enter the stream. It is also known as achieving the Sotapanna state of being. It is not difficult to become a stream-entrant as most people believe. Yet it is a delicate thing. And it is only grasped by those who are wise. Thats where the problem lies. When one reads this book, he can realize the said stream-entrant state. But there is a chance that he may not know he realized it. This state is unique. It is a teaching that must not be given to each person you meet. The one who obtains the initial information can travel the path to stream entry. If there is a person with high wisdom then he can learn the path at once. No preliminary information is necessary for him. He understands at once that there is something beyond the limit that we perceive. When you follow this path, you will meet the said state.
There are many people who believe that a stream-entrant noble follower must be able to travel in the air with his superpowers. This is not true. They believe that those who arrive at noble states like stream enterer should be able to perform miracles. There is no such thing. There are three kinds of miracles as per Buddhas teachings:
 Miracle of superhuman power
 Miracle of Teaching
 Miracle of reading others minds
Buddha said, Out of these three miracles monks, the one you should perform is the miracle of teaching. What does it mean to perform miracle of teaching Performing miracle of teaching means teaching others the Dharma that you realized and confirmed.
Buddha said, monks, the greatest miracle a monk can perform is the miracle of teaching.
There is a story where Buddha crosses a river.
One day Buddha was by a river with his assistant Ananda, waiting for the ferry to arrive. A hermit comes to where they were, laid out a scarf, got onto the scarf and floated across the water. Then Ananda turns to the Buddha and asks;
Why dont you also get us across the river like that
Buddha replies,
Ananda, be patient and wait for the ferry.
So they wait. When the ferry arrives he pauses before getting on and asks the ferry conductor,
 How much do you charge to cross the river
Conductor replies,
Twenty five cents your honor.
Buddha turns to Ananda and says,
Ananda, the value of that miracle is twenty five cents! That person dedicated thirty or forty years of his life trying to get that power. But if he had used that time to travel the Noble Way and to get the Noble Fruit then he would have already crossed Samsara.
People waste time trying to get magical powers. If those people spent that time trying to cross Samsara by training the mind, then they would have already escaped Samsara. Instead of finding reasons to cross Samsara, people find reasons not to cross Samsara. They collect things that are hindrances to liberation.
People try to achieve things that they can never achieve. They try to hold on to things that they cannot hold on to. They try to keep things that they cannot keep. They try to enjoy things that cannot be enjoyed. Knowing well they will not get them, they still go chasing after them.
Keep running
Keep doing what you are doing the same way. Just know that you will never get them. Keep running after them. While running think like this; regardless of however much I run, I will not be satisfied. I will never get what I am trying to get. What I will get is not what think it will be. It will always be something else.
What you think will not happen in life! You will not get to enjoy what you hope for. Are you going to run seeking these things
Yes, run! Run until you are completely out of breath. When you run like this, at the right time your heart will tell you to stop running. Dont stop. If you stop then that is not because you realized Dharma. It would be because you stop. Then one day you will start running again. So do you run after worldly goals, or not
Run!
Run until you are out of breath. When you are out of breath the heart will become the witness say, Didnt such and such a person say you will be out of breath due to this running But you did not agree with that. And you did not believe it. Now it has been proven to you. Do you still want to run, or not
You will never run again. You have stilled for eternity. That means you have entered the stream.
After that, due to the old habit you will get ready to run. Then what happens is your mind says not to run. It says there is nothing to gain by running. Then what happens Then you have lost the need to run.
You should investigate your life in the past. All the running that you did in the past. How you fell and got wounded while running. Think about all this. You have to do a self-analysis about yourself very honestly. Self-analysis is the way to liberation. Self-analysis means:
To search about yourself.
To think about yourself with an open mind.
Feel free to express what you feel. Say what comes to your mind directly, If you want to scold someone, scold the person to his face. That is the greatness. If you have something to say then say it. That is a persons genuineness. It is his greatness. It is his honesty. The one who comes to the way of the Dharma shapes himself in this way. If not that person can not realize this Dharma, If one keeps one thing inside and says something else, then that is a dual personality. A dual personality can never enter the stream. The nature of the stream-entrant noble follower is that he is truthful. If he feels like saying what comes to his mind he will say it.
Now lets say you have done something wrong and someone feels like scolding you for it. Then what should that person do He should tell you that you have done something wrong, and he should scold you for it harshly. That should be the nature. That is also his honesty. But, then do you hate him Do you scold him back You must honor a persons honesty. Noble ones do not look down on honesty.
What happened when Vimala the prostitute follows Moggallana the great Arhat on the street Vimala was a famous prostitute that lived at the time of the Buddha. Vimala saw the handsome figure of Arhat Moggallana and told him of her desire.
Did he scold her
No, he did not scold her.
Did he reject her
No, he did not reject her
Did he chase her away
No, he did not chase her away.
He let her follow him. He took her with him. Took her and did what
He showed her the way to win stream-entry.
Those in the material world always hope for material gains. That is the nature. Try to understand.
Physical Science
There are some hidden rules in this world. A person only understand them after his enlightenment. In physical science there are laws. For example Newtons laws for motion, Ohms law for electricity and Gausss law for magnetism. In the same way there are laws in spirituality. Our mind works according to those laws. They are deep.
We became happy when our wishes came true. We got sad when our wishes did not come true. Now the happiness of wishes coming true and the sadness of wishes not coming true have both gone to the past. What are both of them to you now
A dream.
This world is a dream. It is an illusion. But however the great majority of people have not felt this. That is the problem with not being a stream -enterer. There is a teaching of the Buddha in the Anguttara Nikaya, Sattaka Nipata called Sattasuri Uggamana Sutta. In that Sutta Buddha explains how at one point this world will get destroyed by heat. First the earth will get so hot that all plants will die. Gradually the earth will begin to reach temperatures that will cause it to explode with fire. From there Buddha goes on and says:
Monks, even this earth is without essence. You may live here. You may dwell here. But never get attached. Do not even get attached to this earth. Do not grasp this earth. Do not crave this earth. Do not have hopes of this earth. But, he says, this teaching will only be accepted by a stream-entrant. Why
Because those who have not entered the stream think the earth is self, and it is eternal. They think Idle but this earth will remain. Is he a stream-enterer
He is not a stream-enterer.
A stream-entrant noble follower never accepts that he or the world is permanent or eternal. But the stream-winner knows when he dies he would be buried in this earth. Even though he knows he will be buried in this earth, he does not accept that the earth is eternal. Then what does the stream entrant noble follower accept as eternal
Nirvana.
There are two kinds of people in this world. There are those who accept that Nirvana is the only eternal thing that exists; and there those who accept that this earth and all the other physical objects exist for eternity. Which group do you belong to
You still belong to the group that accepts physical objects as eternal.
If we were to join the group that believes Nirvana is eternal, then we go from one side to the other. For that, something should happened in us. What should happen in us is
We must do a self-evaluation of our life. We must do an exploration about life. Life is a dream, an illusion. We think that this illusion is real. We have been taught how to be stuck inside this right from our childhood. We expect many things in life. When we continue to contemplate life deeper and deeper, we will understand the whole world. When we get that understanding we will become still. That is stream-entry. That is enough to enter the stream.
To realize Dharma, the first thing a follower should have is conviction, Conviction is trust. You accept because you have respect for the teacher. But before you accept, you yourself must do an evaluation about the teacher and his wisdom. What most people do is listen to lectures and remember them. But nobody realizes Dharma. To realize Dharma you must force yourself on to the path of training the mind if you have to. You cannot go in comfort why can you not go in comfort
Your mind is already addicted to various habits. It already has numberless habits.
This mind that is addicted to habits keep running behind a myriad of pleasures. It runs one pleasure and does not find it there. Then it pauses to think about that for a brief moment and then starts running after some other pleasure. It continuously repeats this process. Whether it gets the pleasure or not, it keeps running after different things. So when does this torture of chasing come to an end This process is an endless search for pleasure.
In the end it is all a dream.
If this is all a dream then why run so much Stop! Stop and think. Do not run at full possible speed chasing goals. All throughout Samsara the mind has trained to seek pleasures.
You run to explore:
Hatred,
Jealousy,
Lust,
Anger.
Now each person has made a path for his mind to search for pleasures. You have created a path for your mind to seek lust. When one pleasure is not found, it seeks another. When it loose that, it seeks yet another. Lets stop this crazy running.
We usually tell someone something soft at first. Then what do we do
Next we say it a bit sterner. Then we say it harsh. And if they do not listen at that we do something even more. The great Arhat Moggallana does this to Sakra, the ruler of the - Heaven. You can read this in Maha Thanha Sankaya Sutta.
One day Sakra, Lord of the Devas comes to visit the Buddha to find out about letting go. After hearing about letting go, he goes back to Heaven and builds a castle. One day Arhat Moggallana wants to find out how Sakras practice of letting go was coming along. So Arhat Moggallana appears in front of Sakra. Then Sakra says to Arhat Moggallana,
I built a beautiful castle. Let me take you on a tour to see it.
As they are touring Sakra points out, here are the flower gardens, here are halls etc. After the tour Arhat Moggallana pushes the castle with his foot. The whole castle crumbles down and is destroyed. At that moment the Sakra realized the Dharma. Do you see the nature of realization
If someone attempted to make you realize Dharma in this manner, what would you do You will hate Arhat Moggallana, But Sakra is wise. Sakra thought, What he did was a good thing. He destroyed my castle. When the castle was destroyed I realized that my world gets destroyed. That means Sakra was given a lesson about the stream-entry.
It is mentioned in the Sutta that Arhat Moggallana destroyed Sakras castle with his foot. What exactly did Arhat Moggallana destroy here
He destroyed the world that Sakra had created with the six senses - eye, ear, nose, body, tongue and mind. Here is another question, where exactly did Sakra build his castle
In his mind.
Then what exactly did Arhat Moggallana destroy
Sakras mind.
Where does the world exist
Within eye, ear, nose, body, tongue and mind.
Then what exactly is the meaning of destroying the world
Showing the meaninglessness of eye, ear, nose, body, tongue and mind is destroying the world.
You yourself destroy your world and teach an eternal state beyond this world. Do it without mercy! What is destroying the world Making one realize the meaninglessness of the world he has created with the eye, ear, nose, body, tongue and mind. Then a need, an interest, a hope appears within one to search for something beyond this meaningless world.
Do not underestimate the Dharma. If you understand this Dharma, that person who understands he will never become a loser in life. He will win every day in life. That means there will be no situation for him to win. If you think like this in life, how easy is it to live But to live in line with this Dharma, you must be fortunate.
Have you heard about the great philosopher Sir lsaac Newton Sir Isaac Newtons wife left him.
She said, I cannot live with him. He is always doing mathematics. That was unfortunate for Isaac Newton. What was unfortunate
He did not find someone who is matching. But, do we suffer thinking we did not find a partner who is matching In life if you get the husband, wife, partner or friend that is not matching do you mentally suffer
Do not suffer mentally. Think in the opposite direction.
Listen to the story about Socrates. His wife was mean. She used to yell at Socrates for one thing or the other every day. The reason Socrates became a philosopher was her behavior. So the husbands and wives reading this must yell at the other person as much as you can. When you yell at the other person, it drives that person to greatness. Who helps a Bodhisattva to become a Buddha
It is those who act against him.
Who makes a person an Arhat
It is those who work against him.
Who makes a person great
Those who stand against him.
If one is to reach greatness then he must have a lot of enemies. Without enemies a person does not reach greatness.

Justice K.T. Chitrasiri said it was improper to not informing the Commission about the appearance of Palisena.
It was your duty to inform us about Mr. Palisenas presence. The evidence lead today is completely based on this person. Commissioner Supreme Court Justice K.T. Chitrasiri said to Fernando PC.
He will fashion his evidence according to what Dharmapla said. Senior Solicitor General Dappula de Livera said, objecting to the presence of Palisena within the court room.
I thought he was entitled to be here. I did not do this deliberately. If the Commission wants him to leave, we will abide by that, Fernando PC said.

PT's alleged insider information on treasury bond auction
The former Bank of Ceylon Chief Dealer J.D.K. Dharmapala answered in affirmative when he was asked if it is possible to assume that Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd had insider information regarding the treasury bond auction that took place on February 27, 2015.
Dharmapala said, after receiving the results of the said auction, he felt the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited CEO may have had insider information regarding the said auction.
Asked as to from whom he can presume that the CEO received such information, Dharmapala said the information could have come from either the General Treasury or the Central Bank, as these two institutes have the access to information regarding government debt requirements.
Dharmapala testified before the Presidential Commission that inquired into the Treasury bond issue, yesterday. Senior State Council Dr. Avanti Perera, leading evidence for the day, submitted a CD including several telephone conversations relating to the happenings of the questioned Treasury bond auction.A conversation in which Dharmapala was speaking with a dealer from the Ceylinco Life Insurance Company was a highlight at the proceeding yesterday. The relevant conversation revolves around indicative bid rates. The insurance company dealer said, they were going to bid at a 10% rate in the aforementioned auction, to which Dharmapala said, "Awoth Athek," which can be loosely translated as 'if they accept it at a 10%, it would be a tusker' (meaning it would be a big profit).
Commissioner Supreme Court Justice P.S. Jayawardena then shifted in and said, if the accepted bid rate was to go beyond a 10%, it would be a procession with many tuskers in it. (meaning a very large profit).
Dharmapala was requested to explain what he meant by the term. He said, it meant a big advantage from the part of the dealer and the magnitude of such a transaction. It was observed that the term is of common use.
In a conversation that Dharmapala had with a Central Bank Front Offices officer about the Treasury bond auction, he has said, "to give a vial of poison." The Commissioners requested him to explain what he meant by the expression.
Dharmapala said the expression was to imply the deep-felt anguish as a government officer regarding the auction. I wanted to suggest as to why you (meaning the Central Bank) did this (meaning accepted the bids at a very high rate) to us." Dharmapala further said he never thought the Central Bank would accept bids at high rates at the questioned Treasury bond auction.

Ranatunga concerned about step-motherly treatment to school cricket
The final weeks of the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year division contest could turn out to be a hotly contested tussle. The latest move of such an indication was given by Isipathanas Sanjula Abeywickrema who stormed into the second place after the 15th round of voting.
Abeywickrema who has been lying in the third place for many weeks, took a giant leap forward with a rich harvest of votes to displace Santhush Gunatileka of St. Peters from the second place.
Gunatileka and his team mate from the Bambalapitiya school have been occupying the top two slots in the division 1 competition for many weeks.
Although Peterites Lakshina Rodrigo continued to head after the latest round of voting, their dominance has now been threatened by Abeywickrema. Considering the manner Abeywickrema has marched into the No. 2 spot, it wont be a surprise if he displaces Rordrigo from the top spot in the new few weeks to come.
Many past Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award winners have made their mark in international cricket, making a lavish contribution to Sri Lanka cricket. Shining prominently among them is Sri Lankas world cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga who had won the prestigious award twice in 1980 and 1982 as an outstanding Ananda College cricketer.
In a recent interview, Ranatunga has cautioned on the poor standard of school cricket, urging the the countrys cricket authorities to take immediate action to overcome the situation. He is of the view that the standard of local school cricket has dropped drastically, making a negative impact on the national pool. It is sad to see the deteriorating standards of school cricket.
Unfortunately, officials do not pay much attention on school cricket. School cricket gets step motherly treatment, Ranatunga was quoted as saying.
Ranatunga, who has made a lavish contribution to Sri Lanka cricket, said the cricket authorities have forgotten that the foundation to national pool is school cricket.
They must keep in mind that school cricket of the cradle to the national team. The Government must also focus on sports and particularly on cricket which has brought international glory to our country over the years, he said.
He said that the lack of spectator interest in school cricket at present is due to poor standard in school cricket.
The quality of cricket that is dished out is poor and discourages spectators. Spectators will always be there if quality cricket is played, maintaining high standards. School cricket could regain the spectators it has lost if we could improve its standard, he added.
During our time, future Sri Lanka stars could be identified from junior cricket level. Then when we played first X1 cricket, 10 to 15 out of the top 20 schoolboy cricketers were assured of their places in the national pool. But it is altogether a different scenario now due to poor standards.
Even if a player has performed well at school level now, he will find it hard and is unable to absorb the pressure at club or national level. That is why we dont see schoolboy cricketers stepping straight into the national team and cement their place as experienced during our era, Ranatunga said.
Ranatunga, who has aggregated 5,105 runs including four centuries and 38 fifties and captured 16 wickets in 93 Tests, said winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year or any other major award at the Mega Show is a life-time experience for any cricketer.
You may go places and win many other awards at higher levels subsequently, but an award won at Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year event remains the most memorable in any cricketers life, said Ranatunga.Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award twice remains the most cherished moment in my life.
That gave me tremendous inspiration and confidence when I stepped into the big league. When a schoolboy is adjudged the best batsman, best bowler, best all-rounder or the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year, thats a tremendous boost for that youngster, who could then aim at club level and international arena thereafter, he added.
I always admire the event and the awards I have won there. That is why I always try to make it to the event if I am in Sri Lanka when the show is being held, he said.
Ranatunga, as a schoolboy cricketer at Ananda, was lucky to represent Sri Lanka at the countrys inaugural Test against England in 1982, only a year after winning his first Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title. He made it a memorable occasion by becoming the first Sri Lankan to score a half century (54) in Test cricket.
He has proved his class in limited over cricket too, aggregating 7,456 runs in 269 ODIs, including four centuries and 49 fifties. Meanwhile, the 39th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year most popular contest is reaching its peak with more votes pouring in for the leading schoolboy cricketers.
The contest is sponsored by Sri Lankas national mobile service provider - SLT Mobitel, which has taken the four-decade-old contest towards new horizons. The stepping in of Mobitel to provide financial support to the oldest cricket awards show in Sri Lanka has undoubtedly lifted the standard of the contest which had its humble beginnings way back in 1978/79 with the then Royal captain Ranjan Madugalle winning the prestigious Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year crown.
Since then, it has gone from strength to strength to set new standards and inspiring other media organisations to have similar contests, Not only the winners of the main award  the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year, but also the winners of many other awards such as the best batsman, best bowler and the best all-rounder, have made their mark in the international arena over the years.
Sri Lankas flagship English newspaper  the Sunday Observer, felt the need of recognizing the raw talent of the countrys schoolboy cricketers at a time when there had been no organized inter-school cricket tournaments, other than the traditional first X1 matches of the so-called leading schools.
SLT Mobitel, the national mobile service provider, continues to provide that smart connection to the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Contest. Under the directions of the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Telecom and SLT Mobitel P.G. Kumarasingha, the Chief Executive Officer of the SLT Mobitel Nalin Perera has made a great contribution towards the success of the event during the past decade.
The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year continues to enjoy the longstanding association of the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) and the Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires and Scorers Association under the blessings of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).

## Title: Saving the world: One whale shark at a time

Saving the world: One whale shark at a time
A couple of months ago,while underwater just a few miles off the coast of Colombo, I had a chance encounter with an extraordinary being. As we meandered in and out of a coral-covered wreck, this gigantic creature appeared from the dark depth, a massive whale shark with dozens of little fish swimming gracefully by its side, like a king moving with his court.
The shark stayed with us for almost 40 minutes. He kept circling us, coming closer and closer, shifting on its side to watch us, seemingly loving the attention, the bubbles and all the camera work going on around him. Eventually we had to leave it because of our own bodys limitations to sustain such depth.
At some point, the shark and us got swallowed in a huge and swirling school of small yellow fish, abundant and joyful. Honestly, this was one of the most overwhelming moments I have experienced in a long time. I was crying in my mask, and I was not the only one. The diver next to me was just as emotional.
Most of us, the 7 billion humans, actually never see what is underwater. No wonder we dont care enough about it, despite the fact that life began in the seas, and the Planet is sustained by the oceans. We forget that climate and weather systems depend on the temperature patterns of the ocean and its interactions with the atmosphere. We ignore that oceans absorb carbon dioxide, and as we emit more, the oceans also absorb more. This results in acidification of the waters, which in turn, damages different types of life. We vaguely know that warm waters kill corrals, but we dont know why this is so dramatic, and anyway, its only the Great Barrier Reef way out in Australia, right
At the same time, because of the immensity of the oceans, we get tricked into thinking that we can throw anything into it, and catch as much as we want from it without any significant consequences. Ever so often we hear of a disaster, such as the recent oil spill off the port of Colombo last week, or the unexplained millions of dead fish that washed on to the Mullaitivu beach a few days ago. We read about collective suicides where 300 whales have beached themselves and died for an unknown reason.
But it does not quite affect us, and we move on. Plenty more under, isnt there
When you dive, you suddenly become much more aware about 2 things: the underwater world is a magical, colourful and incredibly bountiful world. And we, the humans, are causing extensive and relentless damages to this vital resource: the massive overfishing around the globe; the spillages from the gigantic urban settlements, from coastal industries or commercial ships, the polluted discharges from rivers with fertilizer run-offs; the trash litter on the ocean floor, the fish and birds dying from swallowing plastics or getting entangled in them. - by 2050 the sea could contain more plastic than fish by weight, according to research done for the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.
Dwindling fish stocks
In Sri Lanka, fish caught in the nets are getting smaller and smaller, yet the number of fishing boats have expanded dramatically in the past 12 years in both the coastal seas and the high seas. Half of the harvest in Sri Lanka is for exports, a revenue stream that creates a strong incentive for more fishing. Yet fleets in large harbours such as Negombo are already affected, as the cost of operations topple the revenues from harvest. And a good chunk of that harvest is wasted on a daily basis due to poor handling. Around the world, 30 percent of the fish species are already harvested beyond their sustainability level, which means the related fish stock is shrinking. Add to this the pollution on the coastal areas, which serve as reproduction and nursery grounds for many ocean species, and the warming up of waters which forces some species to move closer to the poles. You start to get the picture of whats coming up if we dont react, as individuals, as countries, and as humanity
The good news is that there is still a lot we can do to reverse this process, while achieving the targets set under Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG14 Life Below Water).
International treaties and calls for action are important, because they open the path for countries to reframe their own national jurisdictions, policies and regulations. Although it seems sometimes like more bureaucracy, global treaties have been successful in advancing human rights, and tackling global issues such as the depletion of the ozone layer. Sri Lanka is part of many such agreements including the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
Beyond the work done at country level, the role and impact of coastal cities and settlements are becoming more evident. As seen last week in the wake of the US announcement on its withdrawal from the Paris agreement, cities or even coalition of cities have committed to stick to the COP 21 commitments, or even outdo them. Municipal Councils, along with regulatory bodies, have a key role to play in ensuring that pollution of all kinds is addressed and curbed immediately. A most critical and sensitive issue is how Sri Lanka manages and regulates its High Seas and large Marine Ecosystems, and how it regulates fishing and other economic activities in its surrounding waters and within the Exclusive Economic Zone (which is 7 times the size of the country!). Enforcement of regulations in both national and international waters is just as critical for fish stock as it is to peace, to avoid the multiplication of incidents between local and foreign fleets. Monitoring of fish stocks both in coastal areas and in deep waters has started in a more systematic matter, and it is hoped that action will follow to adjust and redress negative trends.
Our responsibility
The private sector has an equally critical responsibility and role to play in the sustainability equation. In particular, large export oriented fishing companies, or high polluting industries. There again, a combination of systematic enforcement of regulations by the appropriate government bodies, and of pro-active, responsible exploitation by the private sector will be required to turn the tide. The tourism industry in all its shape must play a very essential role of containing, and then reducing pollution, limiting overcrowding of natural sites, and ensuring the quality and sustainability of its supply chains. The same apply to the agri business, to reduce the fertilizer and pesticide pollution.
Last, not least, it is YOU, and me, all of us humans, who can make the biggest difference in restoring the oceans to their best natural state. By changing our behaviours and habits, by lobbying with our politicians, by informing our children, by setting trends in our offices, by supporting community led initiatives, there are so many ways we can contribute.
On June 8, we celebrate World Oceans Day. It cannot be a perfunctory celebration any longer.
In Sri Lanka, the United Nations works on key areas around fisheries, marine infrastructure, marine pollution, bio-diversity, treaty implementation.
The United Nations is organising a high level conference on June 5 to June 9 at the UN Headquarters in New York: the Ocean Conference is expect to draw support to the implementation of SDG14: conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.

Let this not be just anexercise for diplomats!
As I watched the shark watching me, I knew at that moment that his life was just as important as mine to keep this beautiful planet alive. And I knew that I have to step up my own work to protect this underworld. So I am asking you here again to take small steps every single day and contribute to saving the planet and its amazing diversity. There are many things we can do as individuals and as voters, such as banning plastic in our lifestyle, reducing our consumption of fish and meat, ride a bike to work, consume mindfully and lead a more simple life in tune with Nature. Please, dont underestimate your own power to contribute and make life changing and planet saving decisions!

Significance of Poson
A deer running for its life through the verdant jungle. A king in pursuit, with a deadly arrow about to be unleashed. A retinue eagerly waiting for the kill to applaud their Kings mastery of archery. Then a voice calling the King by name  Tissa, Tissa. No one would dare call the King by his name, so where did that voice come from
The King wondered and looked up at mountain looming above him. There he saw a calm, peaceful sage-like figure with a group of followers beckoning him to come over. Dear King (Devanampiyatissa), I have come from Jambudeepa with the message of the Buddha were his words. Thus began the most famous exchange of words between Arahat Mahinda, Emperor Dharmasokas son and special envoy who brought Buddhism, Indias greatest gift to Sri Lanka. Before long, the Arahat and King Devanampiyatissa were having a very productive conversation which led to the King and his team embracing Buddhism.
This event, which occurred more than 23 centuries ago at Mihintale, would lay the very foundation for our civilization centred on Buddhism, irrigation and agriculture. Buddhism has been influencing our lives and society since then, becoming a way of life for millions of people. The values espoused by the Buddha have permeated our society, regardless of religious differences.
In the words of eminent scholar the late Dr. G.P. Malalasekara if the criterion of the greatness of that movement be the beneficial influence it has exerted on the character on those who came under its sway, then certainly the mission of Asoka to Lanka has been among the greatest civilizing influences of the world for it bequeathed to the Sinhalese a gentleness of disposition, a love of peace, a nobility and refinement of character of which neither the ravages of times, nor centuries of ruthless warfare, nor the insidious attacks of modern commercialism have succeeded in depriving them.
Today, Poson Poya Day, Buddhists throughout Sri Lanka will mark this momentous event that literally shaped our history and destiny. Pilgrims in their thousands will flock to Mihintale, the cradle of Buddhism in Sri Lanka where Arahat Mahinda delivered the first sermon and also to nearby Anuradhapura, the very centre of the countrys Buddhist civilization and cultural ingenuity.
According to Buddhist chronicles, the Buddha himself had visited Sri Lanka during the 5th month, fifth year and eighth year of his Enlightenment. However, Buddhism did not gain a foothold in Sri Lanka until the advent of Arahat Mahinda, with the residents following various superstitious beliefs and practices. Buddhists believe that the Buddha himself pre-destined Sri Lanka to become the main centre of pure Theravada Buddhism.
One of the salient features of Buddhism is tolerance for other beliefs and religions. Sri Lankans of different faiths and communities have lived together in harmony for centuries. Even though we liberally use the term ethnic conflict to describe the war that ended in 2009, there was no animosity between the ordinary Sinhalese and Tamil people. It was politicians on both sides who created this monstrous conflict.
Today, there are attempts by certain politicians and their henchmen to sow the seeds of religious and ethnic discord again for their political advantage. Ethnic discord is the only way out for these politicians rejected by the masses at every turn. They will gladly pit one community against another if it achieves their political aims. The Police and Government agencies must take stern action against these rabble rousing elements aiming to destabilize the country.
These groups are spreading various canards to end the unity among various communities. One such blatant lie is that the Government is planning to take away Buddhisms foremost state in the Constitution through the proposed new Constitution. The Government has on more than one occasion categorically denied any such move. Besides, no other religious community has asked for such a step at any time.
Religious leaders must come together to defuse any tensions at this moment when we are striving to achieve lasting peace and reconciliation. They must act as a unifying force against the forces trying to tear the communities apart and warn the faithful on the sinister designs of such forces. No room should be allowed for any attempts to destroy the cohesiveness of the countrys social and religious fabric at this crucial juncture.
This Poson also comes right after one of the most calamitous events in recent history, a massive flood which killed more than 200 people. Most people have rightly channeled their Poson Amisa Pooja (material offerings) for the benefit of flood victims. It is indeed a time for helping each other and also reflecting on the impermanent nature of our very existence as espoused by the Buddha. The very resilience of Sri Lankans in the face of even the worst calamities such as the tsunami could be explained by the infusion of Buddhist thinking and values in our day to day life. Buddhism provides a refuge for our minds and this Poson, we should redouble our efforts to spread compassion to all fellow beings, human and animal.

Teachings to behold
During his brief stay in the island, Arahant Mahinda made use of five works of the Pali Canons: Cullahatthipadopama Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya I, 3. 7), Peta Vatthu and Vimana Vatthu, two books of Khuddaka nikaya (short volume) on celestial and ghostly mansions, Devaduta Sutta (on Heavenly Messengers - Majjhima Nikaya III 3. 10) and Balapandita Sutta (on Wise and Fool - Majjhima Nikaya III, 3. 9.).
The whole royal family of King Devanampiyatissa is said to have become Buddhists following these sermons; some family members in fact attained the first stage of sainthood, Sotapanna.
Sotapanna is the stream-winner, which literally means entering the stream. He eradicates the first three fetters: belief in an individual self (sakkaya di<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>hi), doubt or uncertainty, especially about the teachings (vicikiccha) and attachment to rites and rituals (silabbata paramaso). The rest go as sensual desire (kamacchando), ill will (vyapada), lust for material existence and rebirth, (ruparago), lust for immaterial existence and rebirth in a formless realm (aruparago), conceit (mano), restlessness (uddhacca) and ignorance (avijja). The sotapanna is named after a simile that compares attaining nibbana with crossing a stream and reaching the farthest shore. Sotapanna, hence, is the first followed by three stages: sakurdagami (once-returner), anagami (non-returner) and arahant (totally awakened).
One sublime reason for the solid establishment of Buddhism in Sri Lanka is arahant Mahindas skilful choice of works from the Pali Canons. His mission in sailing for Sri Lanka was more than just converting another royal clan into Buddhism.
This fact is clearly corroborated, as the arahant did not get to the conversion business right away; his first requirement was inquiring intellectual capacity of the chief of state with the historys first recorded famous Intelligence Quotient on trees and relatives.
Simile of the elephant footprint
With this in the setting, Culla Hatthipadopama Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya: Sutta 27), a minor discourse on the simile of elephant footprints, is an interesting study. Linguistically, Hatthi, Pada and Opama mean elephant, foot and simile respectively in Pali.
The source is based on a conversation between two Brahmins (non-Buddhists): Pilotika and Janussoni. Pilotika, though not a perfect Buddhist convert, describes his pleasant feelings about Buddhist philosophy and its followers to Janussoni, making the latter get fascinated in a follow up.
An inquiring-minded Janussoni raises the issue of Buddhas claim to be an Enlightened Being. Simply put, the learned Brahmin questions Buddhas feat of wisdom, to which Pilotika brings out a simile of an elephant.
 Suppose a wise elephant woodsman were to enter an elephant wood and were to see in the elephant wood a big elephants footprint, long in extent and broad across. He would come to the conclusion: Indeed, this is a bi bull elephant. So too, when I saw four footprints of the recluse Gotam, I came to the conclusion: The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Sangha is practicing the good way.
(Translation by Venerable Nanamoli and Bodhi Theras)
The Buddhas footprints, Pilotika notices, involve the non-Buddhist scholars thinking about raising a particular set of questions and getting armed with rebuttals for obvious answers. Pilotika joyously explains how he sees the same scholars becoming the Buddhas disciples. Pilotikas argument is that he has the capacity to measure Buddhas accomplishment of wisdom by seeing his disciples.
Janussoni could be made satisfied by Pilotikas explanations, but it reflects the modern-day misunderstanding of Buddhism.
Buddhism is generally understood as the fact that the true Buddhist stays away from basic sins such as slaughter, stealth, uncelibacy, false speech and alcohol consumption. The core of the teachings, however, is far deeper.
Comparing religions
Arahant Mahindas choice shows the clear difference he wanted to point out between a normal saint and a Buddhist saint. The best way to see the truth is walking from darkness up into light. Janussoni was enlightened when he heard the Buddhas expanded version of elephant footprint simile. Just because the footprint was large in length and breadth, it does not help picture the big elephant. There can be dwarf female elephants with feet large in length and breadth.
Likewise there can be other non-Buddhist saints who stay away from the sins; most sins are listed in the sutta. A big elephant if fathomed only by seeing the whole being.
So the real Buddhist saint should be understood, or the real accomplishment of wisdom should be understood, by the realisation and the practice of four noble truths, originally taught in Buddhism. The sutta is hard to understand in one go. However, if studied carefully, the sutta helps us develop the idea that the modern-day concept of comparing Buddhism with other religions is not theoretically correct. Every religion has its unique features, and so has Buddhism: four noble truths, for one. Although the message seems simple and clear, it is hard to convince it to a run-of-the-mill. It is this background that led, or forced, arahant Mahinda to inquire the intellectual capacity of King Devanampiyatissa to get the message.
Many scholars, especially Westerners, entertain the theory that Buddhism encourages only the saintly life. Arahant Mahinda gives the lie to this famous misconception with his subsequent sermons of Peta Vatthu, Vimana Vatthu, Devaduta Sutta and Balapandita Sutta, which mostly discuss the way a Buddhist should behave as a layperson. For instance Peta Vatthu illustrates the fate of evil-doers and Vimana Vatthu focuses on what the virtuous can await.
Heavenly messengers
Devaduta Sutta talks of five heavenly messengers we see in our life, but continuously and unknowingly pass over.
The five heavenly messengers go as follows:
1. A toddler standing and lying with difficulty.
2. An old woman or man decayed and bent like the framework of a roof.
3. A sick woman or man, immersed in their own urine and excreta, raised by others and conducted by others.
4. An offender taken hold by the king and given various kinds of torture caned and whipped.
5. A dead woman or man after one day, two days or three days, bloated and turned blue.
Balapandita Sutta teaches how the human beings suffer through their follies, thus encouraging good deeds.
The primary reason for arahant Mahindas arrival in Lanka is the third council which took place during Emperor Asokas regime under the guidance of Ven Moggaliputtatissa. It was a hard task for the emperor to set the background to the third council, but reached the expected fruition. Arahant Mahindas emissary role is a result of the third council of Buddhism held during Emperor Asokas period.
Third council
The council in fact remains significant and weighty since it paved way for the establishment of the teachings in nine different countries; hence Arahant Mahinda set foot in Lanka, one of the countries then known as Thambapanni, to establish Buddhism.
The background for the third council was created 218 years after the Buddhas demise, in Emperor Asokas regime.
Despite his notoriety for military offensives, Asoka turned into a different personality following the encounter with a novice monk.
The emperor soon grew interest in the teachings.

UNHRC resolution cannot be repudiated by Parliament: Sampanthan
The Sri Lankan state is bound to implement the UNHRC resolution and it cannot be repudiated by Parliament as demanded by the Joint Opposition(JO), Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan said.
The Opposition Leader speaking at the Adjournment debate moved by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday, called for the full and expeditious implementation of the Geneva Resolution.
This is not a resolution against Sri Lanka, but a resolution pertaining to certain acts committed by the two parties of the conflict violating humanitarian and human rights laws. The culture of impunity should not continue, he said.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa himself had gone to Geneva in the 1990s to seek its intervention when there were grave human rights violations in the South. What happened in 1988-89 and 2008-09 are crimes against humanity, he said.
This should not be confused with legitimate actions taken by the State against armed combatants carrying on an armed struggle against the State. Can the killing of Lasantha Wickrematunga,the disappearance of Prageeth Ekneligoda, five students in Trincomalee, 17 workers in Muttur be swept under the carpet because those who committed them are members of so called war heroes Our concern is on the wanton killing of unarmed civilians in furtherance of political agenda of persons holding high office, he said.

Uva PC strives to revive rural education: Chief Minister
Education in rural areas deteriorates due to the dearth of teachers. The Uva Provincial Council along with the government strives to address the issue by constructing new buildings, providing equipment and other infrastructure facilities to schools, Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake said.
The Chief Minister made these observations after opening a new laboratory at Moneragala, Thabana Primary School in the Bibile Education Zone on Tuesday.
Teachers are living Gods who develop knowledge, attitudes and skills in children, he said. The Chief Minister said the provincial council pays more attention to develop rural schools as children in rural areas find it difficult to travel to towns to obtain higher education.
The provincial council recruited 2,000 teachers recently. The council held an examination to recruit 500 primary teachers, but their appointments were withheld on a court order, he said.
The Chief Minister admired teachers' commitment and dedication to render their service amidst lots of constraints at rural schools.

His friends erected a tomb on the rock where he was killed.
Karunasena said the pillar of the tomb was about 40 feet high. But from time to time, it has been subject to lightning strikes.
Its height has been reduced to about 20 feet to avoid lightning.
