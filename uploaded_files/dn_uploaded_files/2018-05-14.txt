Mom youll never be forgotten
From the carriage ride around Windsor to the lemon and elderflower cake, the forthcoming royal wedding will be a blend of the suitably formal and the touchingly personal. Here's how the couple plans to remember the groom's mother, the late Princess Diana, in the details of their big day.
The flowers
When it was revealed that Harry and Meghans wedding flowers were going to be designed by Philippa Craddock, a telling detail was also included. Among the seasonal branches of beech, birch and hornbeam  along with plenty of Meghans favorite peonies  it was also revealed that the florist would be incorporating white garden roses into the floral displays, which were Dianas favorite flower.
Not only were white roses used lavishly in the wedding of Harrys parents Charles and Diana, but they were also planted all over Dianas final resting place of Althorp, and were used extensively in her memorial garden at Kensington Palace which opened last year. At the time gardener Sean Harkin spoke of his choice of roses for the White Garden, revealing I think lots of people would refer to Princess Diana as the classic English rose. It felt like it was a must to include them.
The Spencer family
Princess Diana and Prince Harry
In the years after Dianas brother Earl Spencer gave a eulogy at her funeral that was openly critical of the Royal Family, it was unclear what kind of relationship William and Harry had with their maternal relations.
However the royal brothers have increasingly shown that they value their mothers side of the family, and they are very much a part of their lives. Not only was the entire Spencer clan invited to William and Kates wedding, but William and Harry have also attended their maternal cousins weddings over the years, and Dianas niece Laura Fellowes is one of Princess Charlottes godmothers.
So although Harry and Meghans guest list is less then a third the size of William and Kates, it will still be packed with Dianas relatives including her sisters Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, their partners and their children, plus Dianas brother Earl Spencer, his wife and his older children. A statement from Kensington Palace revealed, In addition to having the support of The Queen, his father The Prince of Wales, and his brother Prince William as Best Man, Prince Harry is also keen to involve his mothers family in his wedding ... Lady Jane Fellowes will give the reading.
Charity affiliations
Diana was patron of dozens of charities throughout her life, but there are a few key causes that were especially close to her heart. It seems that she was very much in Harry and Meghans thoughts when they were deciding which seven charities would benefit from their wedding gift fund.
Following in the footsteps of William and Kate at their own wedding, Harry and Meghan have stated that instead of gifts, they would like people to donate to the seven charities they have chosen.
These include The Childrens HIV Association, which supports children growing up with HIV across the U.K. and Ireland. Dianas affiliation with HIV/AIDS charities was so significant that she was given a posthumous award by Attitude magazine in 2017, which was picked up by Prince Harry. Another of Harry and Meghans charity choices was Crisis  the UKs national charity for homeless people, and homelessness was another of Dianas most significant charity affiliations.
The princess used to take her young sons on her visits to shelters so that they would understand first hand and from a young age, that not everyone had as privileged an existence as theirs.
The gems
Meghan is already in possession of a very special piece of jewelry with a significant connection to her late mother-in-law Diana: her engagement ring.
While the central diamond is from Botswana  which is where Harry and Meghan spent time at the beginning of their relationship, and returned for Meghans 36th birthday in 2017  the two stones either side are from Dianas personal collection. During their engagement interview Harry explained it was, To make sure shes with us on this crazy journey together. While Meghan added, Not being able to meet his mum, its so important to me, to know that she is a part of this with us.
Additionally, Meghan is likely to be given another piece of Dianas jewelry by Harry on their wedding day, and we may never know anything about it. It is customary for royal grooms to give their bride jewelry on their wedding day. Prince Philip gave the queen a diamond bracelet which was made from stones from his mothers tiara, and its thought that William gave Kate a pair of Dianas sapphire and diamond earrings that were remodeled specially for Kate. Dianas jewelry was passed down to William and Harry for them to gift to their future wives, so it is highly likely that Harry will present Meghan with something from his mothers collection.
The people
Diana was famously known as the 'Peoples Princess,' for her ability to make connections with those who she had only just met, and instilled in her sons the importance of reaching out to members of the public.
So it is the ultimate tribute to his late mother that Harry has requested that 2,640 everyday folk be invited into the grounds of Windsor Castle to share in his big day.
The crowd will be made up of 1,200 members of the public  from every part of the UK and a mix of backgrounds and ages, focusing on young people who have shown strong leadership and those who have served their communities  as well as 200 people from the couples favorite charities, 100 pupils from local schools, 610 Windsor Castle community members, and 530 members of the royal households and Crown Estate.

## Title: No adverse impact on govt revenue, will not result in influx of workers

FTA with Singapore
No adverse impact on govt revenue, will not result in influx of workers
The Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, says that it is the policy of the government to negotiate FTAs with selected countries, as part of its new trade policy.
The Ministry says that the Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was entered into with proper consultation process and will not have adverse impact on government revenue, and would not result in influx of professional and workers entering the country. A lot of negative publicity has been generated in this regard.
This Ministry wishes to state that the aim of this policy is to achieve a diversification of exports and export markets; to create linkages to global production and value chains; integrate Sri Lanka to the global economy; and thereby by virtue of the nexus between trade and investment, attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the country.
The Government has adopted a policy of engaging in a dialogue and consultation with all stakeholders in pursuing this goal. The Ministry has been holding regular consultations with Trade Chambers, Trade Associations and Professional bodies. Stakeholders have also been kept informed of the status of the negotiations and possible commitments that were to be undertaken on regular basis.
This Ministry has also had specific consultations with stakeholders in Construction Related Services, Computer Related Services, Tourism sector, Maritime sector and the other this engagement will continue.
Certain Professional Association has expressed their concerns about the influx of professionals and other workers into the country. The Movement of Natural Persons from Singapore has not been opened except for intra-corporate transferees in senior management and business visitors linked to investments. There is no liberalization whatsoever of independent movement of natural persons (not linked to investment).Business visitors will be permitted for a period of not more than 30 days for purposes such as market scoping, business agreements and so on.
Cooperate transferees (transferees from a branch of a company with an investment in Sri Lanka) are also limited to Managers, Executives and Specialists who are clearly defined in the relevant schedules of the Agreement. Their period of entry is also limited initially up to 2 years or over the period of contract, whichever is the less with an extension not exceeding a total of 5 years.
No Movement of Persons either Singapore citizens or permanent residence have been opened in professional services. The concern that engineering and architectural services have been opened is also incorrect. This Ministry states that the only commitment is for cross border services (via the internet  and not relating to movement of people) and that too limited only to pre design advisory and consultative services and does not include the practice of architectural or engineering profession.
This is only through use of internet and other means and not through investment, commercial presence, of movement of professionals to the country. Providing this type of services is already possible through the existing regulation and legislative framework.
The new regulations under the Immigration Act in order to strengthen the regulatory framework have almost been finalized and will be submitted to the Cabinet shortly. When they come into force, they will address the concerns raised by the Professional Associations as well as other stakeholders. The regulations will stipulate procedures to be followed when employing foreign nationals, categories of employment, employer and employee obligations, and the roles to be played by the professional bodies on recognition of qualifications etc.
It has also been stated that this Agreement would lead to millions of non-citizens of Singapore arriving into Sri Lanka including PR holders and citizens of India, Bangladesh and other countries. It should be mentioned that the entire permanent resident population of Singapore is only 527,000 in 2017. Second, the SLSFTA does not permit any permanent resident to work in Sri Lanka. The only permitted entrants are those who qualify as corporate transferees: i.e., persons employed by a Singaporean company with investments in Sri Lanka.
Third, such persons would have to be employed in that company for at least 12 months. Furthermore, only the most skilled and highest tiered personnel are eligible  this is clearly defined in the schedules. Fifth, if a person has a dominant and effective nationality in a third country, such persons would be excluded. Therefore, a Singapore company cannot higher and send a citizen of another country to work in Sri Lanka. To say so is inaccurate and misleading.
Given the above facts, the permanent residence holders arriving in Sri Lanka is extremely limited and entry will be tied to a corresponding investment in Sri Lanka, thereby benefitting the country as a whole.
There has also been reference to the Tariff Liberalization programme (TLP) of the Agreement. Whilst it is true that Sri Lanka undertook to liberalize 80% of its tariff lines when Singapore has already liberalized 99% of its tariff lines, it is misleading to even claim that it amounts to a unilateral concession.
The prime objective of the SLSFTA is to attract FDI from Singapore into Sri Lanka in the manufacturing and services sectors and to link to global production and value chains. In this regard a high-powered Singaporean business delegation visited Sri Lanka in this week to explore investment possibilities and establish business contact with the business community.
In any event, it should also be noted that in FTAs signed by Singapore with its other trading partners, t he level of liberalization invariably exceeds 90% of the tariff lines. Sri Lanka, in comparison, has been able to limit it to 80%, thereby keeping 20% of tariff lines in the Negative List to accommodate domestic sensitivities and revenue concerns.
It should be mentioned that the TLP has been carefully designed to have the least impact on domestic industry and revenue collection. Sri Lankas tariff liberalization will take place over a period of 12 years to 15 years.
Though the TLP requires Sri Lanka to liberalize 50% of Tariff Lines immediately when Agreement comes into force, 50% of these tariff lines are already duty free and CESS free on a MFN basis.
Consequently, it will not have any immediate impact either on revenue or domestic industries.
It has been also mentioned that tariff liberalization will result in a substantial loss of revenue to the Government. Obviously, this has been factored into our negotiation. There will be little or no impact from the immediate list since those lines are already duty free and CESS free on a MFN basis.
Moreover, import data on products imported from Singapore will show that out of total imports of US $ 1293 million in 2017, US $ 750 million were petroleum and related products (in fact amounting to 60% of imports from Singapore) and US $ 228 million were gold.
Furthermore, the Rules of Origin criteria in the Agreement stipulate that product imported from Singapore will not qualify for tariff concessions unless 35% Value addition over change of Tariff Heading take place in Singapore.
This ministry will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the Trade chambers and Professional bodies, even in the future, as we negotiate in the other Agreement.

Tax revenue should benefit underprivileged
Finance State Minister Eran Wickramarathne said persons with high incomes should be taxed and the tax revenue should benefit the poor.
Under the new tax, those who earn Rs.100,000 per month is exempted from income tax and those who earn Rs.150,000 per month has to pay a Rs. 6,000 income tax.
He was addressing councillors of the 18 local government bodies in the Matara district last Saturday.
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera convened the meeting to motivate the newly appointed councillors.
We overthrew the former regime in 2015 by telling the people that we were capable of developing the country. Politics is a marathon. Many fail considering it a 100 metre distance. Then they ruin their political future and of those who elected them, State Minister Wickramarathne said.
The State Minister said that like any household, a government undergoes a deficit between income and expenditure. Any housewife knows this situation, he said. The deficit is measured as a percentage of the GNP and is usually about seven percent. Taxes are imposed to reduce the deficit, he said. The important question is who should be taxed and to benefit whom
The taxed money is used for education, health services and to provide other basic essentials to low income groups, he said.
The State Minister said the UNP would win the next Presidential Election. Winning the election is a brain game, he said.
"The government reduced the prices of 48 essential medicines and removed the ceiling on medication for cancer patients. A research institute was established for kidney patients. Heart surgery is performed for free at government hospitals, while a subsidy of up to 75 percent is provided for surgeries done at private hospitals. Upgrading rural schools under the closest school is the best school programme and allocating Rs. 24 billion to provide hostel facilities for university students are some we carried out in this regard,," he said.
The government should take care of its senior citizens, he said.
The State Minister said those who receive high income benefit the most from government subsidies. It is unfair, he said
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera and former Matara Mayor Upul Nishantha Subawickrema addressed the gathering.

Victimisation of UNP supporters will be investigated
Public Administration and Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena yesterday said that around 800,000 families have being subjected to political victimisation during the past 20 years for been supporters of the United National Party (UNP).
The minister said the fundamental rights of these families have been violated. He said currently a committee is investigating grievances of those who were subjected to victimisation during the past 20 years and human rights officials will look into the issues.
The minister was speaking to the media after presenting compensation to families whose property was damaged during the recent violent incidents in the Kandy district.
Compensation amounting to over Rs. 8.8 million was given for 260 properties damaged during the recent incidents. The event was held at the Kandy district secretariat. Minister Lakshman Kiriella too was present.
The Minister went on to say that the UNP had obtained the highest number of seats at the last general elections followed by the SLFP, and the two parties had formed a unity government. In this context, members of one party in the unity government cannot sit in the Opposition.
The minister said after the two parties in the unity government, the political party which had won the most seats was offered the Opposition leaders post.

50 Greatest Players in World Cup History
#46 IKER CASILLAS
Just past the hour mark, when Sneijder played him clear down the centre, Arjen Robben must have felt like the fairytale was building up to its grand climax and that haven was just a few strides away. But life is not a washed up scriptwriters one-dimensional handiwork.
He was up against La Furia Roja, the matadors who had bullwhipped their way into billions of hearts and also to the FIFA World Cup final in South Africa. Their quality was so evenly sprinkled that you had to get the better of every last one of em or remain seated at the gates of glory and applaud them.
Iker Casillas. A just-about-6-foot unflinching minefield of a man who is hell-bent on letting nothing past. Robben could go either side of Iker and he chose to curl it in, as is comfortable for him. But the Dutchmans shot would deflect out of relevance, dismissed by the trailing leg of Casillas who always had it covered.
A few minutes later, Arjen Robben, this time focussed and sharp like a spear drove through the heart of Spains defence and sent Puyol spiralling like a ragged doll before hacking Pique to the ground. Robben hardly did anything wrong but before he could poke it into the net, Casillas had already arrived.
He swept the ball up from Robbens feet and kept Spain in the game for the second time that night. A goal saved is a goal earned. And Iker Casillas is one of the greatest ever to have made that a habit.
Casillas did use to get flak for his height and apparent inability to deal with crosses and corners in a manner that behoved a Spain and Real Madrid no.1 but you couldnt find anybody who was sharper in the area if you scouted the length of the world.
Usually, when a goalkeeper parries, the danger is only half cleared. Casillas speed of recovery has disturbed many a floor thanks to the number of jaws that dropped. Hed get right back up and stretch himself as wide as he could to become the most annoying obstacle any striker has had the misfortune of going up against.
He kept it up for 20 odd years at the very top after having been first summoned for national duty at the age of 17. He was as immense as anybody in a Spain team and as influential as any in making them world beaters at one point.
Casillas saved twice in the quarter-match against the Republic of Ireland in the 2002 World Cup to drag Spain into the semi-final. Though they crashed out against South Korea under controversial circumstances, his wonder save from an absolute bullet from the left side of the box was rated as one of the top 10 saves of all time by FIFA.
The Saint was a natural leader and his bravado and charisma filled the box with an aura that needed pure magic to be shattered.
Though it has faded with age and Robben and co. did get their revenge on Casi, when he was operating at his prime, he could cover both posts with the kindof explosiveness that left his peers jealous.
Iker Casillas has definitely left a mark on the game and he has pulled several dramatic saves that fits perfectly with the grandiosity of a football World Cup. He always kept Spain in the hunt and if the defenders failed, well, it was still aeons away from the end of the world.
In the 2010 World Cup, Spain could have faced a shock exit but Casillas denied Oscar Cardozo from the spot in normal time. David Villa would clinch a late winner in the game and of course, was hailed in grander terms than Casillas was. But San Iker didnt mind.
That he was their standout performer on the night of their lives served Casillas phenomenal career right. And when he lifted the World Cup that night, the world gave him an ovation because who doesnt like it when true champions ascend to the throne
And as is obvious, Iker Casillas is one of our 50 Greatest players in World Cup history. - sk

An apple a day keeps the wrinkles at bay - for women
Forget expensive face creams or anti-ageing lotions. The secret to staying young-looking can actually be found in your fruit bowl  if you are a woman.
Scientists have found women who eat a diet rich in fresh fruit and vegetables have fewer wrinkles when they pass the age of 50 than those who dont eat as healthily. But eating well apparently makes no difference to a mans facial appearance, researchers at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam found.
Women who ate more bread, red meat and sweets had more wrinkles, and so did those who drank alcohol. The findings suggest snacking on fruit could be a much cheaper alternative than pots of cream and bottles of lotion for women seeking younger-looking skin.
British shoppers, mainly women, spend an estimated 120m a year on anti-ageing face creams alone, and millions more are spent on tonics, moisturisers and serums. Meanwhile, demand for the wrinkle-busting toxin Botox continues to rise, with a 50 per cent increase among young women having the jab in recent years.
Researchers at Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam quizzed 2,700 men and women aged over 50 on their eating habits. Each one then underwent a 3D face scan to measure the number of wrinkles.
The results showed women who had the highest intake of fresh fruit, vegetables and fish had the fewest lines on their faces. But women who regularly ate large amounts of red meat, bread and sweets had the most.
Healthy-eaters who enjoyed a drink or two every day had more wrinkles  suggesting alcohol undoes some of the good that comes from eating nourishing foods. And eating habits appeared to have no major bearing on the number of wrinkles on mens faces.
Their findings were published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. Previous studies have found women may be more prone to wrinkles and one reason may be they tend to have thinner skin.
Researcher Dr Selma Mekic said: In addition to not smoking and protecting the skin from the sun, this work suggests women who wish to look younger longer may now have another way to delay the development of wrinkles.
Those with high scores for fruits, vegetables, and fish, and low scores for meats, sugars, saturated fats and alcohol, showed significantly less facial wrinkles. But this was only the case for women. No difference was observed between men who ate a healthy diet and those who did not.
Scientists think a fruit-rich diet helps by ensuring the body has plenty of vitamins and flavonoids. These are health-boosting compounds that protect the skin against ageing and stimulate the growth of collagen  the fibre that keeps skin stretchy and taut.
Women are thought to be more susceptible to wrinkles because they have a lower density of collagen in the skin  men have a higher density so may look young for longer.
Dr Sajjad Rajpar, a consultant dermatologist from the Edgbaston Hospital in Birmingham said: Because of their thinner skin, as they lose collagen with ageing, women are more likely to develop lines and wrinkles.
Products claiming to improve ageing skin include eye creams, supplements, botox and even stem cell injections. Two London entrepreneurs have created a vitamin C shower head which softens tap water and douses the body in the vitamin in a bid to banish wrinkles. Daily Mail

Chandrakala Ratnayake
She was courageous
Time shall heal they say; but to me, time has only been intensifying the aching wound of my beloved mothers absence in this world. She was the special person who brought light into my life from the day I was born, not only in times of joy, but in times of deep sorrow and struggle. Even though she had been gone throughout one year, which to me, felt like a lifetime, I still feel her ray of light falling on me from heaven above. But I admit with pain that the challenging moments have been appalling without Ammis presence, while the dainty moments of joy have been dull throughout the year that passed-by.
My beloved mother departed this world on May 12, 2017, after courageously fighting an ailment that was discovered, treated for and persisted for three short-lived months, leaving my father and I only the consolation that her duration of anguish was minimal. The robust, courageous, good-looking and strong-willed lady in my mother did bear, void of complaint, the complications involved with an ailment of the nature. She set an example by not giving up until her last breath at the Kurunegala hospitals Coronary Care Unit, to which she was transferred from the Oncology Unit. We all were drained due to the varying magnitudes of her illness during those three months. My memory holds on tight with desolation, to the last nine hours that my mother fought for dear life. Life breaks everyone, but some people heal stronger in the breaks, they say and my mother was one of those who healed stronger in the breaks.
My mother lived a complete and dynamic life. Amongst the seven siblings of the Senanayake family from Kurunegala, she was the fourth. Having obtained her education from Maliyadeva Girls College in Kurunegala, she joined the Hayleys Group back in the 1960s, where she served for nine years.
While in school and during later years, she played basketball under the guidance of All-India Basketball Coach P. Chelladurai and also represented St. Annes College, Kurunegala, in a trainee camp held at the St. Anthonys College Courts in Katugastota back in the 1960s.
After tying the knot with my father Ananda Ratnayake in 1973, she pursued a career at Marhaba Travels in Sharjah, UAE, where she served for several years before returning to Sri Lanka. Being the family-oriented woman, later in her life, she, along with my father, lived with me in California, USA and in Sri Lanka, until her passing.
The grief of my mothers demise had been continuously suffocating my soul throughout the past year, letting the tears fall silently down my cheeks, every single day, not for the world to perceive.
Death has left heartache in me that no one can heal. Time has just taught me how to live with the pain and face this riddle called life in the absence of my mothers warmth and care. Yet, I am aware that ammi, you are watching over me and appachchi from somewhere over the rainbow. You are my Mona Lisa and you will always be beautiful in my eyes!

S. P. Abeysingha
Exemplary individual
The sudden demise of S. P. Abeysingha of Parakandeniya, was a shock to his friends and relations. After retiring from the position of Inland Revenue Department Deputy Commissioner, he was practicing Buddhist meditation and helping others to learn and practice meditative processes as well.
S. P. Abeysingha (Abey to his friends) was an exemplary individual who always upheld and promoted positive moral qualities such as integrity, honesty and equanimity in whomever he came into with.
After a brilliant school career at Galahitiyawa Central College, he entered the clerical service after his A/Levels. He was in the batch of students who had to do their O Levels in Sinhala and switch over to English for their A Levels.
He faced the challenge with courage and endurance, motivating his colleagues to do the same and came out with flying colours. Barriers and challenges in life were no limiting factors to his progress. He was instrumental in helping the school in numerous fundraising activities through the Past Pupils Association, in which he was Secretary during the 1980's. The funds were utilised for the requirements of underprivileged children.
His dedication to the work and responsibilities entrusted to him, were recognised by his superiors, enabling him to rise in his career in the Internal Revenue Department.
Though he started out as a clerical officer, he was promoted to staff ranks over a short time and finally became a Deputy Commissioner prior to his retirement. Abey was a keen student of Buddhism and lived by its principles, showing the way to correct Buddhist practices to his friends, colleagues and anybody who sought his counsel. He visited numerous places local and abroad, to obtain first-hand information on insight-meditation form gurus and leaders of those institutions. The extensive knowledge and experience gathered by him were shared with his fellow men.
Abey was a sincere friend and an exemplary citizen. May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Three years have passed by since the untimely demise of Dr. Mervyn Gunasekera at the age of 67 years. A time when as a professional, he was active and involved in many areas of Engineering and Project-Management. Academically, he contributed effectively at both undergraduate and post-graduate levels. He was a successful entrepreneur, having established the LAN Management Development Services (Pvt.)

Vernon Gunasekara Jr.
He possessed a heart of gold
Does a name speaks for itself In most instances, the answer would be no. But in the case of Vernon Malik Akbar Gunasekara, the answer was always yes; his name spoke for itself in volumes.
Vernon was a great man and a faithful friend who cared for all who was near and dear to him. He was a true gentleman with a heart of gold, always putting the needs of others before his own. An Attorney-at-Law, a writer and author, Vernon or Verna, as we used to call him, was called to rest on April 10, 2018, at the age of 53.
Born on May 31, 1964, to a Christian pater and a Malay mater, he practiced all religions sans discrimination. During the month of Ramadan, Vernon, as a true believer, carried out fasting to the letter.
He always celebrated Christmas and furthermore, I myself have witnessed him observing sil on two occasions.
He received his early education at St. Anthony's College, Kandy, of which the motto was Lux de Coelo, meaning a light from heaven; which he himself was to his alma mater. Upon completing his G. C. E. A/L's, he joined the Sri Lanka Law College, whereby popular majority, he was elected the Law Students' Union Vice-President. Back then, the Law-Medical was a single day event. Cricket and netball matches between law and medical students followed by a dinner-dance, was the order of the day. It was under Verna that it was turned into a Law-Medical Week.
The Peradeniya University Akbar hall was erected to commemorate Justice Akbar; Verna's grand-uncle. Sir Oliver Gunathilake was the maternal uncle of Verna's late father; Vernon Gunasekara Sr.
He was one of the founding members of Lanka Sama Samaja Party and was also its first secretary. Being an ideologist in Communism and Trotskyism, he assisted lawyer H. V. Perera in the famous Bracegirdle Case. Our Verna's cross-examination skills were impeccable in the Abanwala acid attack case. Even his opponents admired the tolerance and endurance he practiced during the trial of the Gampola bomb incident. His legal arguments were par excellence. His absence would leave a void within his friends.
Is there any possibility to share someone's knowledge after his death The possibility of that impossibility was Verna's last wish. He had requested his wife Suneetha to open a library in his name at their residence. Vernon never hesitated to enjoy the worldly pleasures this world had to offer. His scholarly knowledge in any subject made him a man who could wine with kings and still dine with commoners.
May his soul find peace!

Dear Readers and animal lovers, I would like to say a big thank you from the bottom of my heart to everyone who responded to my appeal so readily and came to my rescue.

Britains 2012 Olympics minister dies
LONDON, Sunday: Tessa Jowell, the minister who played a key role in securing and delivering the 2012 London Olympics, has died after battling brain cancer, her family said Sunday.
Jowell played a major part in landing the Games as Britains culture secretary. She then became the UKs dedicated Olympics minister charged with bringing the worlds biggest sporting extravaganza to fruition.
Jowell, 70, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in May last year, suffered a haemorrhage on Friday, and had been in a coma until her death on Saturday, a family spokesman said.
She moved fellow parliamentarians to tears -- and a rarely-seen standing ovation -- in January when, visibly ill, she returned to her seat in the House of Lords to call for cancer patients to have better access to experimental treatment. - AFP

Champagne garden design celebration
A couple who won 3m on a scratchcard have spent three days mowing a celebratory champagne bottle and two glasses into their lawn.
Sue Richards, 51, and her partner Barry Maddox, 58, won the prize two years ago and moved into their dream home in Billericay, Essex.
They have become known for their lawn art, as green-fingered Maddox likes to set challenges for new designs.
He has previously mowed Wimbledon stripes into his lawn, as well as checker boards. But the latest offering has topped all those efforts.It took three days of work as well as advice from a man the couple have only referred to as Mr Lawn.
Maddox and Mr Lawn cut the design with a range of scissors in varying sizes, as well as the conventional lawn mower.
Its bigger than what I expected but its amazing, said Ms Richards. Its come out really nice. Neighbours can see it as were in a converted bungalow and there are two-storey houses next door. I wouldnt be surprised if the neighbours beyond that have seen it. Richards bought the winning scratchcard as she returned from a night shift as a care worker. Despite the big win, she is still working. The couple bought the house with the huge third-of-an-acre garden for 750,000 and spent money on the five children they have between them. Richards also bought four Audis and a motor home, which she described as her pride and joy. Maddox, who was a building site manager and is now a kitchen designer, said of their newly mowed lawn: You cant say this isnt different! Sky News

Chinas support indispensable: President
President Maithripala Sirisena said the friendship between China and Sri Lanka dates back to ancient times and the tremendous assistance provided by China to the economic and social development of the island nation is highly appreciated by the Sri Lankan government and its people.
The President expressed these views when Ambassador of China Cheng Xueyuan called upon him at the President's Official Residence on May 11 to exchange views on China-Sri Lanka relations and joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative.
The President said China's continuous support is indispensable for Sri Lanka to realize its future development and make itself a new economic centre of the region.
The President said Sri Lanka strongly supports the Belt and Road Initiative, and attaches great importance to the joint mega-projects of the Colombo Port City, Hambantota Port and Industrial Park. Instructions have been given to government departments by the President's Office to accelerate the resolution of specific issues and make progress in the projects.
President Sirisena expressed his objective to attract more investment and assistance from China for Sri Lanka's economic development and its people's livelihood.
The President looks forward to the early groundbreaking of the National Nephropathy Specialist Hospital assisted by the Chinese side.
The President emphasised that China as a sincere friend always reaches out with a helping hand when Sri Lanka facing difficulties.
The handing over of Hambantota Port after its long-term unsuccessful operation is another fresh example in this regard. The two countries' friendly cooperation in the Hambantota Port is focusing on economic development without any other hidden agenda.
The President said Sri Lanka's unswerving support to the One China policy and China's position concerning the Taiwan issue on global arenas including the 71st World Health Assembly to be held in Geneva at the end of this month. Ambassador Cheng ssid China attaches great importance to its friendly relations with Sri Lanka and is willing to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries. Based on the golden principles of Consultation, Contribution and Shared Benefits, China will actively promote Sino-SL pragmatic cooperation under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative to benefit the two countries and peoples. It is believed that under the joint efforts of both sides, especially under the personal guidance of President Sirisena, mega-projects of the Colombo Port City and Hambantota Comprehensive Development Project would rapidly develope to help the island country realize its development dream.
Ambassador Cheng opposed any ungrounded speculation on military purpose of the joint projects, warned of the danger that certain external forces are trying to attack the joint operation of the two sides in Hambantota and the friendly bilateral relations. China is willing to support Sri Lanka in developing its economy and improving its peoples livelihood.
The Ambassador highlighted that the preliminary work of the National Nephropathy Specialist Hospital donated by China to the people in Sri Lanka has almost been completed and the construction will be started soon.
It is expected to be inaugurated within two years and will definitely bring great happiness to patients with kidney disease.
Ambassador Cheng thanked the Sri Lankan side for its firm support to China on Taiwan, Xizang (Tibet) and other issues concerning its core interests. China also resolutely supports Sri Lanka's national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and never interferes in the latter's internal affairs. China is willing to work with Sri Lanka to promote its economic and social development in the spirit of mutual respect, fairness and justice, and win-win cooperation to build a China-Sri Lanka Community of Shared Future.

Outstation cafes and exorbitant prices
Long distance buses are stopped for refreshment near wayside hotels. These hoteliers take the opportunity to sell their food items double the average prices. It does not matter paying more if the quality of the eatables is better. Evan a cup of tea is sold for Rs. 50 instead of Rs. 40 and the quantity of it too is very less. Unhygienic and previous days stuff is also a matter to be noted.
Therefore, the passengers to be satisfied with the services provided, all the outstation bus drivers should be instructed by the National Transport Commission (NTC) to forward a list of the hotels where they stop for refreshment.
The NTC should warn those hotels to be fair in their prices while they should be compelled to display a board which the NTC will provide with its contact numbers for the passengers to inform about the quality of the food, the freshness of them, then the prices of same etc.
This will surely make hoteliers serve the passengers in a better way. They should be warned that if they are found guilty of any offence the first punishment will be to close the hotel for a period of six months. Additional months of closure should be imposed for recurring offences.

CSEs net foreign inflows  top US$ 18 mn in February
Net foreign inflows to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) amounted to US$ 18 million during February 2018, according to the Central Bank.
This included net inflows to the primary and secondary markets as well. Accordingly, cumulative net inflows in the first two months of 2018 were US dollars 54 million. Meanwhile, the government securities market (Treasury bills and bonds) recorded a net foreign investment outflow of US dollars 55.6 million in February 2018, following a net inflow of US dollars 47.3 million in January 2018.
Substantial portion of the daily outflows from the Treasury bill and bond market occurred during the first week of February which gradually subsided in the latter part of the month. Further, long term loans to the government recorded a net inflow of US dollars 108 million during February 2018.
Tourist arrivals in this years first two months saw an increase of 13.8 per cent compared to the corresponding period of 2017. Earnings from tourism are estimated at US dollars 437 million in February 2018, with the cumulative earnings amounting to US dollars 880 million for the first two months of 2018.
Meanwhile, workers remittances moderated in February 2018, as has been the usual pattern over the last several years. On a cumulative basis, workers remittances increased by 2.6 per cent compared to the first two months of 2017.
In February 2018, expenditure on imports recorded the highest year-on-year growth rate since October 2014. In nominal terms, import expenditure in February 2018 amounted to US dollars 1,978 million. This substantial increase in import expenditure was partly attributable to the relatively lower base recorded in February 2017.
Gross official reserves of the country increased to US dollars 7.9 billion at end February 2018, equivalent to 4.4 months of imports. The monthly reserve increase was primarily due to accumulation of Asian Clearing Union (ACU) liabilities managed by the Central Bank. Total foreign assets, including foreign assets of the banking sector, also increased to US dollars 10.1 billion as at end February 2018, compared to US dollars 10 billion at end January 2018. At the end of February 2018, total foreign assets were sufficient to cover 5.6 months of imports.
A notable growth in tourist arrivals and continuous net foreign inflows to the stock exchange amid a significant widening of the trade deficit characterized the external sector performance in February 2018. A surge in gold imports was the primary driver behind the fastest increase in overall merchandise imports in nearly 3-1/2-years, resulting in a further widening of the trade deficit in February 2018.

Data-driven amazon bookstores cant compete
The physical world is a wonderful medium, and its not going to go away. Jeff Bezos, 1999
Chances are, if you are reading this, that you have for some period of your life been a regular at the kind of bookstore owned and run by a mean old walrus with ketchup stains on his shirt and strata of nicotine marbled into his whiskers, and who turns out to be very knowledgeable and cool and non-creepy once you get to know him.
And even though his shop is a musty mess, books piled up like little temples and triple-layered on the shelves and hoarded into far-fetched crannies, he always knows exactly where everything is (and you could always find something surprising and secret and wonderful in there). And then you sort of got to know him a little, and he gave you a dog-eared Pynchon novel when you went away to college, and it changed your taste in prose forever.
That bookstoreyour corner bookstore, the one with real character and worn wooden floors, the one where everybody knows your nameif it is still there, has been barely breaking even for the past 20 years and more. Overall sales of printed books have actually risen modestly over the past four or five years. But you-know-who is scarfing up more and more of the pie. Amazon is now responsible for the sale of north of 40 percent of all new printed books sold in the United States. Amazon sells about two thirds of all books sold online. Amazon has about 350 million customers worldwide, of which an estimated 90 million are Prime members.
When it comes to bookstores, bibliophiles often display a fiercely anti-corporate, moralistic streak. (Back in the late 90s, your pimpled correspondent worked at Blue Dragon Bookshop and wore a t-shirt bearing the proud legend Support your local independent bookstore: Friends dont let friends buy books at Barnes & Noble.) So when Amazon set up shop in the Time Warner Center by Columbus Circle in New York City last yearone of ten stores it opened around the country in 2017it was no surprise when the bookworm waxed wroth.
Every one of the early reviews Ive read, and everyone Ive discussed it with, finds something enraging or gross or troubling in the idea of a physical Amazon bookstore. Everyone Ive talked to about this also shops on Amazon. I chalk this up not to hypocrisy but to the fact that there is still something unreal for us about online shoppingsome part of us cant or wont take fully seriously the thought that as we click to buy we are forking over actual greenbacks, and that this is of some moment to that corner shop. Amazons success comes from the sheer sit-at-home-in-your-PJs convenience of it, but one side effect of that convenience is to mute the sense that your transactions on the site are as real-life as real can be.
Barnes & Noble was early to grudge Amazon its trespass into reality. The worlds largest bookstore sued the Earths biggest bookstore in 1997, on the grounds that the latter tag was false advertising, because Amazon wasnt a bookstore at all, but a book broker. (It ended in a tie.) Mostly, though, the brick-and-mortar facts of online shopping dont sink in. The notion that Amazon has been made flesh in order to exist across the block from that shop, on the other hand, seems just plumb out of lineas if some unspoken taboo has been violatedwhen in fact it is our multitude of clicks come home to roost. - Lit Hub

Thoughts on Presidents throne speech
Emphasis on reconciliation
President Maithripala Sirisenas recent throne speech on the occasion of the commencement of the second session of the 8th Parliament of Sri Lanka witnessed the President laying out essentially the roadmap for the remaining two years of the current national unity governments term of office. It is clear that the emphasis and rightly so, for the remainder of the term would be to revive an economy, yet to recover from a serious overdose of expensive foreign, mostly Chinese loans, obtained by the prior regime for projects of questionable utility value and a lack of serious post-war economic reforms.
If the Rajapaksa Administration got one approach wrong during its second term, that was trying to run the country, post-war, as if the war still existed. This was true of not only national security policies but all policy including economic policies.
Post-war reconciliation
However, the issue of post-war reconciliation or sanhindiyawa is also an essential component of Sri Lankas post-war policy requirements and consequently was also a key part of the policy platform of both the common candidate and the national unity government. Reconciliation requires a democratic and free society. Community and collective rights can only be achieved where individual and personal freedoms are recognized, justiciable and protected.
Accordingly, Sri Lankas democratic deficit needs to be eliminated and with it the creation of a new social compact which recognizes and accommodates the full diversity of Sri Lankas peoples.
It was towards this end that the 8th Parliament of Sri Lanka voted unanimously to turn itself into a Constitutional Assembly which would begin the hard work of seeking to establish that consensus.
In a political environment where sections of the Opposition question the need for national reconciliation or believe that ending the war was the conclusion of an ethnic problem in Sri Lanka, President Sirisena was emphatic on the views and policy direction of the National Government in this regard.
In his address to Parliament, the President stated thus Honourable Speaker! Whatever the opposition, it is essential to enter into a political programme with the consensus and agreement of the people to find a permanent solution to the issue of unrest of the people in the North and East. Although we defeated the terrorists physically, we have not succeeded in defeating their ideology completely.
He goes on to state that at the time we assumed duty as the government, there was a delay of several years to find solutions to these challenges and the task of facing the challenges have become further difficult.
In spelling out the broad programme of the government, the President clearly articulated the issues as follows. Recognize the equal rights-based aspirations of the Tamil people, ensure the well-being and social-cultural needs of the Muslim community. He further committed to empower the upcountry Tamil community socially and economically and strengthen the indigenous identity, by strengthening the cultural identity of the Sinhala people.
Different people groups
What is noteworthy in the Presidents policy statement on reconciliation is its explicit recognition of the various requirements of Sri Lankas different communities and the need for the Sri Lankan State to accommodate the full diversity of her different people groups.
During the presidential election campaign of late 2014 and since then, rarely if ever can President Sirisena be faulted for what he has said. His speeches, always delivered in measured Sinhala is nuanced and very carefully crafted so that he can rarely if ever, be faulted for his public pronouncements. The challenge for his administration in the past and indeed in the future will continue to be to deliver on its good intentions and well-articulated policies. The midterm rebuke at the polls for the two political parties partnering in the national unity coalition government was probably the publics response to the perception of non-delivery on the extraordinary expectations created by the twin mandates of 2015.
Interestingly the President calls for a more matured political culture which seeks out common ground and consensus in policy implementation and also requests that the political competition between the political partners in government should cease.
2020 elections
This is indeed a timely call and the animated political debate on the 2020 elections is surely premature, at no other point in Sri Lankas recent political history was a government so focused on an election several years before its due. While a focus on the path or process of a return to power may not be unreasonable for a political opposition, it is foolhardy for a government. A focus instead on what needs to be delivered for the mandate it has already received may well be the better option for the government.
The other side of the coin, are the smaller political parties which backed Maithripala Sirisena as the then common opposition candidate for president, the TNA, the Muslim parties and the JVP. The TNA, especially as the third largest party in parliament, has an important role to play as the governments key interlocutor on reconciliation. Recognizing that it has executive authority in the North and East through the Northern and indeed the Eastern Provincial Council, the TNA should seek to deliver practical solutions to the real-life needs of its constituency.
Mirroring the electoral rebuke for the government parties in the South was the setback for the TNA in the North. That the TNA mostly lost votes, not to the more Tamil nationalist elements but to the EPDP, the TMVP, Rishard Bathurdeens Party and the EPDP breakaway independent group of Chandra Kumar demonstrates that the Tamil people had also wearied of a perceived non-delivery of a peace dividend or indeed a good governance dividend and held the TNA and its provincial administrations in the North and East, responsible for the non-delivery. Leading up to 2020, fulfilling the mandate of 2015, maybe the best politics for the rainbow alliance of political parties which contributed to the same.

In terms of volume East West & Browns Capital led foreign purchases while Dialog & JKH led foreign sales. In terms of value East West & HNB led foreign purchases while JKH & Dialog led foreign sales.
Point of view 
Equity markets extended its losing streak for the 3rd consecutive week, hitting a one-month low on Friday as the CBSLs expectations of a modest recovery in 2018 and decision to hold policy rates steady failed to conciliate markets.
The benchmark ASPI fell 28 points over the week to slip below the key 6500-mark around which it has hovered around for the last 3-weeks.
Despite the dull sentiment which has kept retail investors largely on the sidelines, local HNI and institutional investors made a comeback this week, helping prop weekly average turnover levels. HNI and Institutional investors who remained largely away from the market over the last week of April and 1st week of May, accounted for 40% of this weeks market turnover (cf. average of 24% in the prior two weeks) as large transactions in 3-stocks (JKH-35% of weeks crossings; Melstacorp-25% of weeks crossings and UAL- 23% of weeks crossings) drove investor activity.
Weekly average turnover levels consequently rose to a 5-week high of Rs.0.80Bn, helping push up the YTD weekly average turnover levels to Rs. 1.03Bn.
Foreign investors meanwhile continued to slow its pace of buying domestic equities, reflecting the broader global theme of declining foreign inflows to EM/FM markets over April amid rising US yields, a stronger dollar, increasing crude oil prices, and doubts over the continuation of synchronized global growth.
Despite foreign inflows to the CSE ending on a positive note this week, the net position on the Colombo bourse declined 32% W-o-W.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from corporate earnings from the Mar18 quarter which have begun to trickle in.
CBSL keeps policy rates unchanged
The CBSL held policy rates steady at its 3rd monetary policy review for the year (SDFR-7.2%; SLFR-8.50%), adding that more time is needed to assess the market and economic impact of its Apr18 policy rate reduction of 25bps.
The Monetary Authority noted that while overnight rates responded to the Apr18 policy rate adjustment to decline (and then stabilize) around the midpoint of the narrower policy rate corridor, other market rates are (particularly rates on lending ) are expected to also adjust downwards in line with the decline in short term interest rates.
The CBSL added meanwhile, that despite high seasonal credit demand during Mar18, private sector credit remains at envisaged levels. The Bank also highlighted that headline inflation continued to decelerate as food price volatility has eased on the back of better domestic supply conditions, while core inflation continues to remain subdued indicating contained demand pressures.
The CBSL noted that although a temporary uptick in inflation is expected in the short term due to the impact of upward price revisions to domestic petroleum products, LP gas and milk powder, inflation is expected to stabilize at mid-single digits by H218 as the transitory impact of these supply driven pressures ease and domestic food supplies improve further.
GDP growth meanwhile is expected to recover modestly in 2018 due to stronger global economic activity and improving domestic conditions.
The CBSL noted that while continued fiscal consolidation efforts may dampen growth prospects, the macroeconomic benefits from this fiscal discipline will be vital in ensuring sustained growth over the medium term.

Fuel prices will be reduced when world prices drop - PM
Fuel prices had to be increased because the price of a barrel of oil had increased by 41 dollars since 2016 in the international market. As soon as the prices decrease in the international market, that benefits will be passed on to the people, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing a Janahamuwa at Hikkauwa on May 12, after opening a new building of the Hikkuaduwa Divisional Secretariat.
The Prime Minister said he wished to delve on the fuel price increase because it had became a burning issue in the country. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation increased fuel prices last Thursday. Earlier, they acted according to the prices prevailing in the international market.
But, although the previous regime increased local prices when the prices increased in the international market, it did not reduce prices corresponding to the decrease in prices in the international market, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister said they had no control over fuel prices in the international market, but he and President Maithripala Sirisena had both agreed that when prices decreased in the international market, that the benefits should be passed on to the people as a relief.
In 2014, the price of a barrel of crude oil in the international market was 55 US Dollars. But local prices were not reduced then. But when they came into power they reduced the price of a litre of petrol to Rs. 117. By 2015, a barrel of crude oil had comedown to 35 US Dollars. This enabled the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation to reduce fuel prices, he said.
But by 2017, the price of crude oil started escalating in the international market. By mid 2017 it was 67 US dollars, and by May 11, it had shot up to 77 US dollars a barrel. As such, we had to pay an enormous sum of 77 US dollars per barrel instead of the earlier 35 US dollars.
Consequently, a price of a barrel of crude oil had increased by about 41 US dollars by now. This was twice the price which was obtained in 2015. This forced the government to increase fuel prices on a limited scale. There is much debate in the country about the price of Kerosene. It they reduced Kerosene prices it will be used for vehicles in place of diesel, the Prime Minister added.
This would consequently decrease diesel sales and income while kerosene use would create mechanical defects in vehicles. That was one reason why the price of Kerosene was increased but the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation had been directed to issue Kerosene to fishermen and Samurdhi families with out electricity at a subsidised price.
The CEB and SriLankan Airlines owed the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation as outstanding bill amounting to nearly Rs. 70 billion. Whether they would be able to settle these bills in a short time was questionable.
That was why the government increased fuel prices as a measure to fill the gap of outstanding bills and to recover the loss crated by an increase in price in the would market state income was insufficient to service debts obtained in 2013 and 2014, the Prime Minister added.
After the government assumed power it was able to service the debts at least though financial management and utilise other finds for development work. As the government introduced economic stability it had to face the Meethotamulla garbage dum problem, floods, drought and other natural entire agriculture industry was hampered by the drought expensed in certain areas development were still in progress in flood affected Galle and Matara district. Due to the expenditure the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation could not be assisted through the Budget or state income, the Premier said.
Already, certain entrepreneurs were accusing the government saying bank interests were too high. What would you have done if bank interest was increased by another 5 or 7 per cent. Instead of going in for such harmful actions we settled for an increase in fuel prices as an alternative measure, similarly fuel prices would also be decreased when there was a decrease in prices in the international market, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that when prices decreased in 2015, the government passed on the benefit to the people. Although prices increased in 2017, they continued to supply oil at reduced rates there by incurring a loss. But, since prices had escalated to unexpected levels the Petroleum Corporation could not continue to cushion the effect by providing fuel at reduced prices.
If state funds were used to set off Ceylon Petroleum Corporation losses, it would jeopardise development work of a number of development projects already launched in the Galle district.
No Trade Zone had been launched in the country after the Koggala Trade Zone. Now, the government is taking steps to set up an Industrial Zone in the Charlemount estate in Weligama. It would also have a IT Centre,Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Funds had been obtained to establish a massive tourism industry on a 1,800 acre plot of land in Deddwwa as revealed by Minister Gayantha Karunatilleke. This means that the Galle region would get three Tourist Zones and one Trade Zone. Another Trade Zone would be set up on 400 acres in Kalutara, the Prime Minister said.
Funds had to be spent on the Hambantota Trade Zone too. Unless funds were used for development projects, the country would not achieve progress. When there are opportunities to raise funds, they should use them for development work, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister also opened new buildings at the Habaraduwa, Akmeemana and Gonapinuwala Divisional Secretariats and also inaugurated the Gonapinuwala water supply scheme.

BARCELONA, Sunday: Lewis Hamilton took his second win in succession by dominating an eventful Spanish Grand Prix.
The Mercedes driver was supreme at the front in a race that featured a heavy first-lap crash, two caution periods and a number of spins and collisions.
Hamiltons win moves him into a 17-point championship lead, with title rival Sebastian Vettel fourth on Sunday following questionable strategy calls from his Ferrari team. Valtteri Bottas made it a Mercedes one-two ahead of Red Bulls Max Verstappen.
The Dutchman held on to third place, easily fending off Vettels challenge, despite damaging his front wing when he ran into the back of Lance Strolls Williams at the restart after a mid-race virtual safety-car period. Vettel dropped to fourth from second when Ferrari decided to pit him under the virtual safety car so he could attack the last part of the race with fresher tyres. But the decision did not work out and cost Vettel what could be a crucial six points in his title fight with Hamilton.

Heavy rains in Galle
Owing to the torrential rains that lashed throughout Galle from Saturday until yesterday morning, vast expanses of low-lying areas in and around Galle and a number of highways were inundated with rainwater causing immense hardship to the public.

Going organic, growing vegetables at home
Homegrown milestone
The new Agriculture Minister in his first Cabinet paper is planning to promote organic agriculture. At present, 3,801 farmers in Sri Lanka are cultivating paddy under organic farming on 4,955 acres. The Cabinet paper, which aims to encourage farmers to cultivate organic farming will propose providing financial assistance to farmers to encourage them to use organic farming instead of giving them a fertilizer subsidy. The fertilizer subsidy will be granted to the farmers who use chemical fertilizer on their paddy fields.
This article is about growing organic vegetables at home. While Sri Lanka has a majority living in homes with modest land around, urban built-up settings are showing an increasing trend of apartments units. What this article shows is vegetables can be grown for domestic consumption in either setting with little investments.
As long as theres sunshine and you spend five minutes every day to water your plants, you can really grow your vegetables, harvest and eat your live organic nourishing vegetables within three weeks.

Organic Veggie Walls in schools
Often, schools find it hard to build or sustain an Edible Garden.
Students get to have their hands dirty: transplanting, soil mixture, watering and fertilizing their plants. They get to see and observe each and every plant every day. This is important for students learning: Observing the weather and the plants environment, plants response and caring for plants.

Kerala Smart Kitchen Gardens: Grow your own food at home
In a bid to motivate more people in the state to pick up organic farming and eventually grow their own food, the Kerala government has been introducing different agricultural programmes and schemes under its ambitious Haritha Keralam Mission.
Now, the Kochi-based Vegetable and Fruits Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) has collaborated with the state government in a novel initiative, which will encourage more citizens to not just invest in organic farming, but more importantly, consume fresh, homegrown, and pesticide-free produces.
Through the Grow Your Own Food (GYOF) programme, VFPCK aims to help interested households by setting up Smart Kitchen Gardens on their rooftops and has already partnered with city-based WRENCH Solutions, which will aid the organisation to source and distribute high-quality seedlings.
VFPCK has also recently kick-started a seedling production unit under a budget of 10 crore for the same purpose. VFPCK has also recently kick-started a seedling production unit under a budget of 10 crore for the same purpose.
The Smart Kitchen Garden will reportedly comprise coir pith-based grow bags filled with compost instead of soil. These bags are being touted by the concerned authorities to be more productive than their regular counterparts sold in the market.
Polycarbonate greenhouse sheets are used which offer more durability. They can last up to 10 years, and also have an additional UV filter coating, which protects the plants from the excessive heat. For a nominal sum, WRENCH will provide all facilities, including the crops and panels, said K Varghese Daniel, who is the CEO of WRENCH Solutions, to The New Indian Express.
The first-of-its-kind concept in the state is expected to be piloted in Kochi first, and will subsequently be launched across Kerala.
Smart watering tips for your vegetable garden
1. Water selectively: Only water if your plants really need it. Dig a small hole with a trowel (or just poke your finger in) to check for soil moisture at root level.
2. Time your watering: Water early in the morning to give crops time to absorb the moisture before it evaporates in the heat of the day. This also allows any water that gets on the foliage time to dry off before nightfall, helping to minimize problems with slugs and fungal diseases. Watering heavily now and then will encourage a more extensive root system than watering little and often.
3. Take careful aim: When watering by hand, aim at the base of plants where its needed. This will also keep foliage dry.
4. Tap water: Sink plastic pots or upturned bottles with the cap removed and the bottom cut off up to the rim next to thirsty plants such as squash. Water into the pot; the water will reach the roots instead of running off the soil surface.
Optimize vertical space
See picture 3
Your main challenge is how smartly you utilize your vertical space to double up the space you have on your terrace, make a plan on how you should do this, if you have walls, hang planters on it. Grow vegetable shrubs and vines like beans, squashes, gourds and tall tomato varieties near the walls and railings.
This way theyll not only get support but also grow outside and upward and youll save a lot of your space. Use old shelves, racks to keep pots and buy pot holders, put them around the corners. On these you can grow herbs to improve the taste of salads and cuisines youll prepare, you can also grow a lot of flowers to appease ornamental views.

How the favourites are shaping up a month from the World Cup
PARIS, Saturday: With the 2018 World Cup in Russia starting in a month, AFP Sport takes a look at how the biggest names -- who between them have won 13 of the last 20 tournaments -- are shaping up:
GERMANY
Germanys build-up has been marred by uncertainty as to the fitness of first-choice goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
The 32-year-old Bayern Munich man has been on the sidelines since suffering a fractured foot in September.
I do not think its imaginable that I go into such a tournament without match practice, Neuer admitted last week. His natural replacement is the excellent Marc-Andre ter Stegen of Barcelona.
Low has a core of the team that won the 2014 title, and can also call on the likes of Joshua Kimmich, Leon Goretzka and Timo Werner. Marco Reus will hope to be fit this time too.
After winning all their qualifiers, Germany have failed to win recent friendlies against England, France, Spain and Brazil. Nevertheless, they are the worlds top-ranked side and almost always deliver at the World Cup.
BRAZIL
In 2014, Brazils hopes rested on the shoulders of Neymar, and the back injury he suffered in the quarter-final win over Colombia sparked the meltdown which led to the 7-1 humiliation against Germany in the semis.
Fast forward four years and the nation is again sweating on his fitness. The worlds most expensive player is recovering from a foot injury suffered playing for Paris Saint-Germain in February. The absence of his PSG colleague Dani Alves with a knee injury is a huge blow too, but Brazil still look far better now under Tite than they did in 2014.
They comfortably topped South American qualifying and there is greater strength in depth. Add to that a kind-looking draw, and Brazil have a genuine chance of a sixth title.
SPAIN
After poor showings in their last two major tournaments under Vicente del Bosque, Spain are on the up again under his successor Julen Lopetegui.
The former goalkeeper has yet to lose a game in charge, with Spain dropping just two points in qualifying and recently destroying Argentina 6-1 in a friendly.
With Sergio Ramos and Gerard Pique still there in front of David de Gea, they have one of the best defences in the business. Further forward, it will be difficult to stop the likes of David Silva and Isco in full flow, and then there is Andres Iniesta.
We are delighted that he keeps playing this well and are excited about him keeping it up at the World Cup, Lopetegui recently told FIFA.com.
FRANCE
France fell short on home soil at Euro 2016, losing in extra time to Portugal in the final. That increases the pressure on coach Didier Deschamps to deliver this time with a gifted squad. Deschamps team won their qualifying group despite some unconvincing performances, including a goalless home draw with Luxembourg, and the coach has his critics.
To silence them he needs to find the right system to bring the best out of his squad, especially in attack, where Antoine Griezmann is the main man but teen sensation Kylian Mbappe will be one to watch too. This is also surely the stage for Paul Pogba to really step up.
ARGENTINA
After their defeat in the 2014 final, this is Lionel Messis big chance to finally get his hands on the trophy.
However, Messi only rescued a shambolic qualifying campaign by scoring a vital hat-trick in Ecuador in the last game to take the team to Russia.
There are huge doubts about the rest of Jorge Sampaolis squad, and the coach recently said Messi can carry the team on his shoulders.
But Sampaoli must also get the best out of the many undoubted talents at his disposal, including Sergio Aguero and Paulo Dybala, to help his sides chances of reaching the latter stages.  AFP

Jetwing Symphony tops  Rs 1.5 bn revenue in 2017/18
Jetwing Symphony PLC(JETS) revenue surpassed Rs. 1.5 billion in 2017/18, a 106% increase to the previous financial year.
JETS, the investment arm of Jetwing, announced the results for its first financial year of operation following the successful Initial Public Offering in December 2017.
Tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka only increased by 3.2% to cross the 2 million mark due to various conditions hampering the growth of the industry. Despite these setbacks, Jetwing Symphony PLC revenue surpassed Rs. 1.5 billion, a 106% increase to the previous financial year. This is partly attributable to Jetwing Colombo Seven and Jetwing Lake completing a full financial year of operations. Jetwing Yala, Jetwing Colombo Seven and Jetwing Lake contributed 38%, 33% and 22% respectively to the groups topline. The group performance is aligned with financial year 2017/18 estimated figures as indicated in the JETS IPO prospectus.
Hiran Cooray, Chairman, Jetwing Symphony commented, We are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the first financial year of operation.
The entire team responded exceptionally well to the challenging environment in order to achieve significant growth and exciting milestones.
We are confident in the long term growth of the industry. With an ever expanding portfolio and other strategic initiatives, Jetwing Symphony is aligned to exceed expected levels of profitability.
Operational efficiencies and resulting cost savings helped achieve an operational profit before depreciation and finance costs of Rs. 414 million. The group recorded a net loss of Rs. 349 million in line with what was forecasted at the time of the IPO and this can be primarily attributable to the relatively new portfolio of hotels. While Jetwing Colombo Seven and Jetwing Lake operated for its first full financial year, Jetwing Surf, the groups newest venture commenced commercial operations in December 2017.
Jetwing Yala recorded a PAT of Rs. 42 million in financial year 2017/18, showcasing immense growth of 127% compared to the preceding financial year. Although the other four operational properties are yet to break even, they have recorded substantial growth with Jetwing Colombo Seven and Jetwing Kaduruketha being profitable at EBIT level.

Keaton Jennings hits century for Lancashire at Trent Bridge
LONDON, Saturday: Keaton Jennings second successive century and a fine performance from Lancashire's seamers put them on the verge of beating County Championship leaders Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge on Saturday.
Jennings was bowled by Stuart Broad (4-41) for 126 as the Red Rose county moved from 157-4 to 338 all out.
Facing a deficit of 205, Notts second innings saw Steven Mullaney, Chris Nash and Ross Taylor all out for nought.
Notts recovered slightly from 1-3 to reach stumps on 106-5, trailing by 99.
Earlier, opener Jennings followed up his 109 against Somerset with his 16th first-class century off 214 deliveries to strengthen his chances of adding to his six England Test caps. The squad for the first Test against Pakistan will be announced on Tuesday.
England hopeful Joe Clarke scored his second County Championship century in a row for Worcestershire, before Alastair Cook led Essex's fightback at New Road.
Clarke's brilliant 105 was compiled as wickets tumbled around him - the hosts collapsing from 142-2 to 238 all out. The 21-year-old was eventually out lbw to Ravi Bopara (3-30), having helped the Pears to a lead of 61.
Essex moved to 143-4 at the close of play, to lead by 82 with England opener Cook making 66.
James Hildreth hit his second century of the summer to help bat Somerset into a commanding position on day two of their Division One game with Hampshire.
Somerset soon picked up the two wickets they needed as Hampshire were bowled out for 231 at Taunton. Gareth Berg (4-88) helped reduce Somerset to 134-5 in reply.
But Hildreth, who finished unbeaten on 125, put on 133 for the sixth wicket with England's Craig Overton (80) to help his side reach 324-7 at the close. Hildreth, 33, who struck 15 fours, has now scored 322 Championship runs this summer at an average of 64.4.
Surrey and Yorkshire were left frustrated by the weather on day two of their County Championship match as rain washed out the final two sessions.
Ollie Pope added 27 to his overnight score to finish on a career-best 158 not out, and helped Surrey to claim maximum batting bonus points before they were out for 414. Yorkshire were wobbling on 40-3 when rain arrived just before lunch.
Derbyshire's bowlers were given a decent platform by their batsmen to try to force a win after the second day of their Division Two clash with Durham.
Resuming on 301-4, Wayne Madsen (85) could only add five to his overnight score, but Matt Critchley's 64 from 85 balls helped Derbyshire to 427 all out. Hardus Viljoen took two wickets in three balls as Durham slipped to 51-2. But an unbeaten stand of 64 from Graham Clark and Cameron Steel steadied the innings before bad light ended play. Leicestershire fought back strongly as they reached 119-2 in their second innings, 132 runs ahead of Glamorgan.
Glamorgan crashed from 82-0 overnight to 178 all out, Indian paceman Varun Aaron claiming 4-65 in his best Leicester display.
Ben Raine, Gavin Griffiths and Neil Dexter shared the other wickets, though the visitors were not helped by some careless shots.
Paul Horton then hit an aggressive 50, but heavy rain ended play.
A Michael Burgess-inspired fightback saw Sussex remain in contention in their Division Two game with Kent.
Resuming on 69-4, Burgess hit 54 from 70 balls and was last man out as Sussex were dismissed for 181, Matt Henry finishing with 4-69.
Ishant Sharma removed both of Kent's openers as they limped to 31-2 before Heino Kuhn (47) and Joe Denly (26) brought some control to the innings. Kent finally reached the close on 125-4, a lead of 159.
Only 26 overs were possible because of rain on day two of the County Championship match between Middlesex and Gloucestershire at Lord's. Middlesex moved from their overnight 356-6 to 455-8 declared.
Olly Stone took three wickets to bowl Division Two leaders Warwickshire into a potentially match-winning position against former club Northamptonshire.
Tim Ambrose hit 78 in a ninth-wicket stand of 95 with Henry Brookes (50) as the Bears were dismissed for 265 to earn a slender first-innings lead. Northants then stumbled to the 160-7, a lead of 151, when bad light intervened.

Keeping your nutrition levels right
Today the Head of the Department of Nutrition, Medical Research Institute, Ministry of Health and visiting Consultant Medical Nutritionist attached to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka and the President of the Sri Lanka Medical Nutrition Association Dr. Renuka Jayatissa (M.B.B.S, M.Sc, M.D, FPGIM, FCCP) talks about malnutrition. During the recent past there was a widespread dialogue in the country about the nutrition status of Sri Lankan people. Here is all that you need to know about malnutrition.
Q: What is malnutrition 
Malnutrition defines both under nutrition and overweight or obesity. Both extremes will be classified as malnutrition.
Q:What cause malnutrition  affects whom and why 
Dr Renuka Jayatissa
Children are more vulnerable for both under nutrition and overweight. It spreads from infancy to adolescents. There are three main causal factors for under nutrition;
1. Immediate due to poor feeding practices and prevailing diseases which reduce the appetite but the needs are high during this period.
2. Underlying: food insecurity due to availability, affordability, accessibility of food; poor caring practices due to poor maternal or care givers knowledge and less time; inaccessibility to health services and poor sanitary practices.
3. Basic causes - economic structure and the country situation.
Overweight is also due to excess consumption of fat, sugar and less physical activities.
Currently Sri Lanka is undergoing nutrition transition and both sides of malnutrition is prevailing in the society.
Q: What are the symptoms of malnutrition and what is the impact on overall health 
Underweight children exeperience repeated illness due to poor immunity, physical growth will be delayed and do not get optimum physical and mental growth; may affect cognitive development and less IQ. Efficiency and productivity will be low.
They will be underweight as women and then underweight pregnant women and deliver low birth weight children. Long standing underweight will cause stunting with inadequate height for the age. Stunted children are prone to get overweight in the future.
Q: What can be done to treat malnourished children and adults 
They need more energy, protein, vitamin and minerals to come out from under nutrition. They need a specially formulated diet or supplements.
They should follow up monthly to monitor if the situation is getting better or worse. If the situation is not improving there is a need to check whether it has affected their weight for height and height for age of children and BMI of adults. If the response is poor with feeding an investigation for underlying diseases should be done.
Q: How can we prevent malnutrition in children and in adults 
Preventing should start from the womb, mother should eat properly to gain adequate weight to have a adequate birth weight for the child. Then the childs growth should be monitored monthly using the growth chart provided by the hospital. If there is slight faltering with the growth appropriate steps should be taken to correct it.
Age appropriate feeding for children;
Exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months; quality nutrient dense food from 6 months of age, and breast milk should be a part of the meal not the main meal. Increase the number of meals to 3 main meals and 2 snacks which include cereals, vegetables, fruits, pulses, animal food in the daily diet. Iron rich food should be given everyday.
For adults - 3 main meals and 2 or 3 snacks but not increasing sugar and fat food. Include nuts to the diet, which is nutrient dense and not interfere with main meals.

Kick that sick habit into orbit!
Kicking bad habits can be extremely hard to do. The effort involves patience and time. In many instances change in certain mundane behavioural patterns are much appreciated particularly in the workplace. In the case of other infuriating habits it is vital that change be effected almost overnight in your own interest and the interest of those around you.
Be aware that there have been employees who have been kicked out of office for being unable to remedy certain disgustingly offensive habits. Workplace etiquette does not essentially exist because of social propriety. Rather, a business has a financial incentive in making sure that a workplace minds its manners and that management and co-workers are polite and show consideration and respect to one another.
That is because it is not always easy to interrelate with the people who you work with. There are factors that could make it difficult to have a successful relationship which could affect the morale of the entire organisation. There are always those who are bound to exasperate you with their idiosyncratic tendencies.
People are sometimes so set in their ways that they dont realise they are being irritable to their colleagues. At times it is just our personality and environment that dictate our behaviour. Certainly, old habits die hard. But it is never too late to teach an old dog new tricks!
Accepting the reasons to change can be an eye-opening experience. No office environment is perfect. And it is not always easy to pigeonhole what may be excessively aggravating conduct in the office. It is easy to point fingers at the lapses of others but take a little time to reflect on your own frailties. It is always advisable to have a sense of awareness of the sensitivities of your co-workers and to be able to read their body language and what they detest.
You may not realise it, but there is always the startling prospect that you may be a perpetrator. Possibly you may be the person responsible for certain frustrations that drive your colleagues up the wall. Working in close quarters with other people always calls for thoughtfulness and adjustment.
But if you are a constant source of disruption and distraction then you are sure to have those around you on an uneasy footing. Such behaviour is certain to cause exasperation and erode camaraderie. Objectionable behaviour such as texting in meetings, spreading malicious rumours, taking credit for other peoples work, ignoring emails and even refusing to say a simple please and thank you are much more than just annoyances.
Stress caused by bad behaviour could be costing businesses staggering losses by affecting the performance of those on the receiving end. Civility costs nothing, but implementing a culture of consideration in the workplace could result in real paybacks in terms of productivity and bottom line profits.
Then there is always the embarrassing hygiene factor. Remember that an air-conditioned office is an enclosed space with re-circulated air. So a stinkpot with foul body odour can make working life a terrible torture for surrounding colleagues. It can permeate the entire office and just sets a bad tone for the entire working day.
So it would always be advisable to bathe before a working day with a liberal lathering of soap. A self-preservative such as a deodorant would be wise to use for good measure. Breath mints too come in pretty handy at times because you will be talking to your co-workers at point blank whiffing range.
In tropical Sri Lanka we are taught from an early age that, left to our own devices, we smell bad. And, well, we sort of do unless we bathe as frequently as is even considered unnecessary by some just to be sure we come out smelling like roses. Fragrances can add to the pleasure and make you reek of the sweet smell of success.
But as mentioned earlier use soap and water substantially to bathe in rather than bathe in perfumes or after shaves.
Being branded the office gossip is not the dubious reputation anyone would relish being conferred with. Then why the heck do you do it It is possibly because you attempt to take the spotlight off your own blemishes by exposing those of others. So a person who gossips by habit does not truly believe he or she is good enough to stand on their own merits.
One of the most effective methods to kick the distasteful habit of rumour-mongering would be to redirect your conversation on sharing your personal experiences, such as your latest vacation, music trends or sports activities.
This will give you something else to discuss besides other peoples divorces or other such scandals.
Besides, you never know whether your tittle-tattle chit-chat would be conveyed to the target of your defamatory action. Keep in mind that gossiping makes you untrustworthy and even treacherous. You may even lose friends and professional contacts when people realise you are a gossip.
Then we mistakenly think we are a cut above the rest by talking down to others. We refuse to listen to reason. Many of us never say please or thank you. We show up late or leave a meeting early with no explanation. We belittle others efforts while withholding information and leaving a mess for others to clean up.
But there are other dangers to be considered as well.
The line between crude humour and sexual harassment is often very thin. Sometimes, jokes that are meant as humour can offend employees and make them feel unsafe or humiliated. Worse still are the touchy-feely types who simply cant keep their hands to themselves.
For one thing remember your co-workers are not necessarily your friends and even those who are may not enjoy being touched.
For this reason, it is better for a workplace to remain polite and professional. Managers should restrict employees from engaging in puerile questionable activities, touching colleagues, crude jokes or offensive language particularly in the presence of the opposite sex. In that way you can cut down on the chance that the company will be the object of a lawsuit by a harassed employee.

Both schools rallied round well, and had some good moves in the last quarter of the game. However Kingswoods poor thinking cost them the game.
For Isipathana apart from Ashan Gunasekaras match winning try the penalty and the conversion came off the boot of Manila Ruberu. For Kingswood the try came from Dinal Ekanayake. Referee: Dinka Peries.

Mitigating the impact of a busy lifestyle on your nutritional health
The great majority of people will experience a food borne disease at some point in their lives. This highlights the importance of making sure the food we eat is not contaminated with potentially harmful bacteria, parasites, viruses, toxins and chemicals. Food can be contaminated at any point during production, distribution and preparation. Everyone along the production chainfrom producer to consumerhas a role to play to ensure the foods we eat are met with proper safety standards. In this article, Dr. Krishanthi Premarathne, Research Member at Sri Lanka Safety and Quality Assurance Laboratory and a senior lecturer at Wayamba and Peradeniya Universities of Sri Lanka talks about the importance of food safety, along with insightful reveal on poultry products of Sri Lanka where she especially addressed the rumors pertaining to Yellow Chicken.
Food safety in any country is a vital part. Can you please explain what food safety is and what aspects we need to fulfill to achieve maximum safety when it comes to food in Sri Lanka
Dr Krishanthi Premarathne
Food safety is concerned with safe sources of all foods and their positive nutritional impact on people. This encompasses inspection and enforcement of all stages from producer to consumer, from being 100 percent free of chemical and microbial contaminations to safe storage, transportation, labeling, preparation, processing, cooking, and service.
With the fast track life style, our healthy diet habits tend to drift away most often. How can we fall into the right track again
No matter how much you may want to make healthy choices, it can feel like there simply isnt time.Being cautious on personal food habits, lessening fast-food and sugar consumption fall into the food safety category and are consumer controlled aspects; them making healthier diet choices will boost food safety and ultimately will contribute to a healthier society.
There are ample ways to make a healthier living namely, filling up your meals with Iron, turning the big meals into soups a salads, eat full meals rather than snacking all day, eat mindfully knowing what you are consuming and what nutrients it offers, daily consumption of vegetables, pump up the protein, turn TV time to fitness time and stay hydrated at all times.
Currently, we find pesticides in products, hormones in milk and antibiotics in meat, leaving consumers to suffer major health risks. What is your view on this
Modern production of foods incorporates a wide range of synthetic chemicals potential that are damaging to humans if they are exposed to high concentrations, or to low concentrations over an extended period of time. Yet,usage of these pesticides is unavoidable since it has become essential for the production process. However the effects can be reduced by boiling, peeling or washing the residue off and adding spices that cuts off all toxic entities in the cooking process or the best thing is simply to grow your own vegetables and fruits. When it comes to meat products, cutting off the excess fat and skin is a good practice to follow as it could have absorbed unwanted pesticide residue. However, the Sri Lankan consumer is falsely advertised about having hormones injected to broiler chickens. When considering the time cost and the fact that hormone imports are restricted, there is no way that these statements are true.
Consumers often pay attention to the colour factor when selecting meat products and it has been rumoured that most consumers assume that the yellowish hue in yellow Chicken is due to expiration. What is your feedback with regard to this
The yellow hue in the chicken meat is mainly due to the presence of the natural colourant named Carotenoids. Corn is a primary natural source of carotenoids that have been used in chicken feed over the past few decades by many well reputed poultry farms mainly in America, United Kingdom, Australia and India. Birds as a whole are unable to produce Carotenoids in their body hence it enters a body through the food intake of a chicken. Yellow corn and maize as chicken feed produce ample amounts of Carotenoids and they are stored in high concentrations in the skin, liver, fat and most noticeably in Eggs Yolk. Otherwise, the yellow hue does not imply expiration or bad quality.
Are there any specialties in chicken with the yellow hue comparison to the regular chickens
Yes, corn is a grain filled with fiber which consists of 73 percent water, also calories,vitamin and mineral supplements which positively benefit to regulate a normal growth, increase bone health, optimal kidney functioning ,maintenance of good heart rate and acts as a source of anti-oxidants of chicken. It only contains 3 percent sugar and the protein percentage is in the range of 44  75 percent, therefore makes an excellent diet for the growth of healthy chickens.
Similarly, Corn fed chicken variety contains higher volumes of Vitamin A than regular chicken that are generally fed with a grain based diet, hence it is ideal for better vision, a healthy immune system and cell growth.
Further, Irish poultry experts as well as the American, British, Australian and Indian poultry professionals have proven that the golden hue produced in corn-fed chicken simply is a measurement of exposing the quality standard and have stated that using corn as chicken feed does boost the taste of the chicken and gives an exceptionally succulent roasted flavor once cooked.

Nepal teen Lamichhane shines on IPL debut
NEW DELHI : Teenage cricket sensation Sandeep Lamichhane said there was more talent waiting to be discovered in Nepal after an impressive Indian Premier League debut.
Lamichhane, aged 17 and the first Nepalese player to land an IPL contract, took one wicket for 25 from his four overs opening the attack with his leg-spin for Delhi Daredevils against Royal Challengers Bangalore.
Lamichhane said after Saturday's match that his journey had just begun.
I think these kind of leagues can help you grow your game. You have to stay busy with cricket all the time, Lamichhane told reporters.
Just as I have got chance in IPL there are many a talent in Nepal. I am playing for Nevis Patriots (in the Caribbean Premier League) this year. The journey has started and there are lots of opportunities for players in Nepal, he said.
Lamichhane made history in the January auction for the cash-rich Twenty20 league when he was brought by Daredevils for $318,000, but has remained benched since the IPL began on April 7.
It was a proud moment for Lamichhane when Daredevils coach and former Australia captain Ricky Ponting handed him his cap and he did not disappoint.
The most important thing is how you are learning all the time. It's been good, this one-and-a-half months, Lamichhane said.
I learnt a lot of things. We have got an exceptional coach (Ricky Ponting) and good captain and all the players are really good. His effort failed to lift Delhi to a win at their home Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium and their ninth loss in 12 matches meant they were eliminated from the play-off race, bottom of the eight-team table.
The Nepalese teenager trained at Michael Clarke's cricket academy in Sydney after he was spotted by the former Australia captain at the Hong Kong T20 Blitz in 2016.
Lamichhane, who trapped Bangalore opener Parthiv Patel leg before for his first IPL wicket, said Clarke was closely following his cricketing career.
We were so close during the IPL season. We spoke to each other and he was saying that you have done so well today, he said on Saturday.
Still I am a bit upset because the most important thing is a team win and if your team is not winning you must be upset. He also had a message for his fans back home.
It all depends on how much you are working hard for all these moments. Most important thing is to be honest with yourself, stay focused, be positive everything will be yours one day, he said.  AFP

This Minister made this announcement during a recent inspection tour of a ground breaking local factory providing solar panels for the first time in Sri Lanka.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said the Government was making a determined effort to build a strong economy in the country, while facing the vagaries of the international market.
In doing so, the governments intention is to keep the economic burdens on the people at a bare minimum. It was in this manner that fuel prices were increased. But, no decision had been taken to increase electricity rates. Our endeavour is to provide maximum relief to the people, he said.

North Korea to destroy nuclear site
SOUTH KOREA: North Korea will destroy its nuclear test site later this month, ahead of a summit with the United States, it said Saturday, pledging to blow up its tunnels in front of invited foreign media.
US President Donald Trump praised the Norths decision to disman tle the Punggye-ri test site in a ceremony scheduled between May 23-25, the latest step in leader Kim Jong Uns charm offensive.
Thank you, a very smart and gracious gesture! Trump tweeted.
Dialogue brokered by Seoul has seen US-North Korea relations go from trading personal insults and threats of war last year to a summit between Kim and Trump due in Singapore on June 12.
But sceptics warn that Pyongyang has yet to make any public commitment to give up its arsenal, which includes missiles capable of reaching the United States.
Washington is seeking the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of the North and stresses that verification will be key.
Punggye-ri, in the northeast of the country, has hosted all six of the Norths nuclear tests, the latest and by far the most powerful in September last year, which Pyongyang said was an H-bomb.
Kim has declared the development of the Norths nuclear force complete and that it had no further need for the site.
The latest measures will see the tunnels of the test site blown up and their entrances completely blocked, Pyongyangs foreign ministry said, according to the official KCNA news agency. All observation facilities and research institutes would be removed, along with guards, it said, and the surrounding area of the test ground be completely closed.
Reporters from China, Russia, the United States, Britain and South Korea would be allowed to cover the event on site to show it in a transparent manner.
Limits on foreign journalists were due to space constraints, it said, as the site was in an uninhabited deep mountain area.
South Korea welcomed the announcement, which signalled the Norths willingness to carry out its pledges not just in words but in action.
We hope the sound of the dynamite blowing up the tunnels at Punggye-ri will be the first salute in our journey towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, the Souths presidential spokesman said. Analysts said the move was positive but limited in its scope.
It was not bad, but a cost-free signal, tweeted MIT political science professor Vipin Narang.
Given the stage it had already reached, Pyongyang may feel like they dont need to test anything for a while, he said.
Jeffrey Lewis, of the Middlebury Institute for International Studies, expected that the North will sanitise the site before letting anyone see it.
Saturdays announcement is the latest move in a rapid sequence of events on the Korean peninsula triggered by the Winter Olympics in the South.
Tensions had been mounting for years as Pyongyangs nuclear and ballistic missile programmes saw it subjected to multiple rounds of increasingly strict sanctions by the UN Security Council, the US, EU, South Korea and others, and Trump last year threatened the North with fire and fury.
But since the Pyeongchang Games, Pyongyang and Washington have agreed to the unprecedented Singapore meeting, and Kim has twice visited China to meet President Xi Jinping, after not paying respects in the six years since he inherited power from his father.
The head of the UNs World Food Programme said Saturday it appeared North Korea was turning a new page in history, following a four-day visit to the country. David Beasley said he had enjoyed unprecedented access to the secretive state, telling BBC radio that North Koreas leaders had a sense of optimism.
Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in last month affirmed their commitment to the goal of realising, through complete denuclearisation, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula at a summit in the Demilitarized Zone that divides their countries.
But the phrase is a diplomatic euphemism open to interpretation on both sides. - AFP

Over 71,000 will get kerosene oil subsidy from June 1
Over 71,000 Samurdhi Beneficiaries and the outboard motor boat fishermen would get kerosene oil subsidy from June 1.
The Finance and Mass Media Ministry sources said the Samurdhi beneficiaries would be provided with a coupon for kerosene subsidy, while the fishermen would be given money to their accounts.
However, only Samurdhi beneficiaries who do not have electricity get the subsidy. According to the statistics, 47,555 Samurdhi beneficiaries would get the kerosene oil subsidy. Of the fishermen, around 24,282 using small scale outboard motor boats would be entitled to the kerosene oil subsidy.
The Treasury would direct the funds to the Social Empowerment Ministry to pay the compensation.
The ministry sources revealed that the measure was taken under the instructions of Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera not to put the burden of the kerosene oil price increase on the low income earners.
The Ministry sources revealed that the fuel prices would be revised once every two months with the new price formula in comparison to the fuel price fluctuation in the Singaporean market.
The sources revealed the price could be increased or decreased accordingly. The fuel price formula was implemented on the Cabinet approval. One could predict the fuel price in Sri Lanka according to the formula to be revised in the future.
The price revision would be announced on the fifth day of every two months.

Postcards from the border
I wonder what really brings me to this hub of chaos, commerce, heat, corruption, danger, hope, confusion. Do they belong to the place, or to me Are we reflecting each other
This text is being written in English, but I know not why, for its experience comes from Spanish. I, too, speak from the border of my languages.
Its the language that brought me to borderlessness as I swiftly move from one word in Spanish to another word into English, through Slovak, finally landing in a sentence, for a while.
A little Guatemalan boy looks around in search of a customer. He approaches me and offers me a candy, in Spanish. This part of Mexico used to be Guatemala, and this boy, like many others, ignores the geopolitical realities of his own time. In 1881 President Justo Rufino Barrios attempted for the last time to regain the region of Soconusco and the state of Chiapas for Guatemala but failed, and in 1882 Guatemala permanently renounced the rights to these territories in favor of the United States of Mexico.
The northern border of Mexico has a similar past, where in 1848, after the Mexican-American War, known in Mexico as the American Intervention in Mexico, Mexico lost nearly half its territory, nowadays the states of California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas, and Oklahoma.
Nearly all of them bear Spanish or indigenous names today, but the meaning of the names is no longer visible, its lost in time. Languages still cross one another; Spanish is an everyday reality in border states.
Harvest hype
Whats the name of this nine-year-old boy He undertook the journey to earn and save money and to return to the place he doesnt call a country when school or harvest begins. He does not use terms like Mexico or Guatemala. He crosses the river Suchiate at a 956-kilometer-long border between two countries, on the Mexican side with the states of Chiapas, Tabasco, and Campeche, on the Guatemalan side with the districts of San Marcos, Huehuetenango, Quich, and Petn. This border is the place of most of the trade between Guatemala and Mexico, and the entirety of Central America.
America is a continent, not a state, but the choice of words subconsciously reveals other realities.
This border is also a home to the Maya civilization that used to inhabit the territories of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, and El Salvador. And languages Until 2003 Guatemala officially recognized the existence of twenty-two Maya languages, while Mexico formally approved another eight Maya languages. Its the only border that has no language.
How does a child cross a border We dont know. He does not reveal, nor do the others. Did he pay a trafficker Was he lucky enough that he wasnt kidnapped or killed or sold for organs or prostitution He is here, he became the master of the street, he even owns a trolley to carry his candies.
Uneducated ultimatum
Karla, who brings food to children in ecological containers twice a week, is one of the few to leave the traditional ideology and education of the noneducated. She serves them food, organizes weekend recreational activities, and understands that preaching about the need to visit a school to a working nine-year-old boy helping a family survive is out of his reality.
Then there are others who are stuck in the biggest detention center in Latin America. Not a day passes that I do not see an American official over there, comments one of the researchers of an NGO working in Tapachula, clarifying who is the boss of this border.
Speaking against the network, you always risk a bullet.
And who are these people What are they looking for A family escaping from the misery of the warlike situation in Honduras, currently one of the most dangerous countries in Latin America, full of crime built on the ruins of military dictatorships and foreign interventions. When foreign interventions are being discussed, it refers to the American onesin English, in Czech, in Slovak, but in Spanish, estadounidenseas American is the abducted name of the entire American continent, the word appropriated by the United States of America. America is a continent, not a state, but the choice of words subconsciously reveals other realities.
None of the translations means anything specifically: American should refer to the whole of America, that is to say, no specific place. Estadounidense is an adjective from los Estados Unidos (United States). We do not have a translation for the word by which the rest of the American continent calls the USA.
Inhabitants inheritance
Back to death and fleeing: San Pedro Sula in Honduras belongs to the third most dangerous city in the world, with 112.09 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, followed by the capital of Honduras (85 murders per 100,000 inhabitants).
And after them, Guatemala. Or El Salvador. Postwar, again.
Another image from a postcard: hours pass by and a family awaits its documents. Meanwhile, the director of the shelter they stay in faces death threats, for he dares to denounce local authorities involved in human trafficking. He managed to incarcerate a few, but they were soon released. The networks are wide and fishes are quick. Speaking against the network, you always risk a bullet. One of the tough realities of Central America.
The southern border brings you to Mexico from the center, Mexico brings you toward the north, slowly, gradually, or turns you back to the center. If you manage to cross the southern border, you have passed the first obstacle and can board the death train (death, again), also called La Bestia, the Beast. Well, to board is not the right word. Its rather a postcard where you look directly at the camera, with no seat reserved inside the train.
La Bestia might bring you to the northern border while crossing the entire length of Mexico, or it might bring you nowhere. It entirely depends on your luck.
Information is a property to capitalize. To not have information is to be outside the capitalist system, being devoured by the predator. - World Literature Today

Many people accuse the public service of corruptions and frauds today, Southern Province Governor Shan Wijayalal De Silva said.
He was addressing the gathering at a function held to recruit 127 Grade III officers to the Public Management Assistant Service, Development Officers Service and Technical Officers Service of the Southern Province at the Southern Province Chief Secretariat Auditorium recently.
Forty four officers for the Management Assistant Service (Open) and 29 and 54 personnel for the Southern Province Development Officers Service and Technical Officers Service respectively were offered appointments.

Now the public officials serve to politicians more than the public, the Chief Minister said.
"As far as they perform their duties honestly, they do not have to worry about allegations. The Establishments Code is to regulate the state service and to guide the public servants but not to harass the public. Public officers must serve the public, the Chief Minister said.
The Chief Minister said government officials engaged in foreign tours regularly. "But they do not learn and admire the overseas administration systems and forget all good methods they learnt there once they returned," he said. Southern Province Chief Secretary R.C.

Rice imports fallen to 23.5 million US dollars in February

Rice imports fell 34.4 percent to 23.5 million US dollars in February 2018 from a year earlier, as harvest came in and domestic prices eased, official data showed. Sri Lanka's rice imports surged from the second quarter of 2017 as the government cut import duties when a drought slashed the industry. In 2017 Sri Lanka imported 300.9 million US dollars of rice, up from just 12.8 million dollars a year ago. However Sri Lanka had a better main cultivation season where harvests started to come around in the first quarter. Sri Lanka also cut taxes on potatoes and onion as prices went up. Taxes on onions and potatoes have already been raised. Sri Lanka's rice, onion and potato farmers cannot produce goods at the quality or price demanded in international markets due to years of protection and cannot export competing with Indian, Pakistani or East Asian farmers. However in recent years, rice yields have gone up, partly helped by with fertilizer subsidies.

Rookamanies Colombo Seven moment
Meet Rookamanie Fernando. She is the newly-appointed General Manager of Jetwing Colombo Seven after more than 33 years of experience in various roles within the Jetwing group. Her professional journey, in an industry where a woman rarely gets the opportunity to break through the glass ceiling to the upper level of management, is truly inspiring.
Here Rookamanie talks about how she started her career as a young school leaver and worked tirelessly to take up one of the highest positions in the hospitality industry.

Q: Tell us about your family and how you ventured into the hotel industry
A: I am a twin child, the other being my brother. I have an older brother, so we were three children in our family. Our parents inculcated in us strong values reflective of our Roman Catholic faith; we were brought up with love and discipline. I studied at Newstead College, Negombo and excelled in languages. Even as a school girl I realized the value of languages, and how they have the power to attract and connect people. After leaving school I studied German and soon joined Browns Beach Hotel as a trainee receptionist. This was my humble entry into the hotel industry.

Q: What was your next career move
A: I had a strong desire to continue learning German. Somewhere during this time I met a foreign delegation who invited me to represent Sri Lanka at an environment convention due to my people oriented skills. So I went to Vienna. It was a wonderful experience. I soon enrolled in the University and pursued my German language. Being away from SL as a young single woman was a nice experience and taught me many valuable lessons in life. In 1986 I came back to my country, as a more mature person.

Q: How did you join the Jetwing group
A: I wanted to join a hotel, so I sent my CVs to the top brands in that era. Would you believe I got called for 3 interviews on the same date! My Interview at Blue Oceanic Hotel, Negombo was conducted by our late Chairman Herbert Cooray. He made such an impression on me and I was touched by his gentleman qualities that I opted to join them without any hesitation. It was a new challenge for me working as a Guest Relations Officer. I enjoyed meeting people from all over the world.

Q: Tell us about your family, and the balance of work- home routines
A: Before I left for Vienna, I had met and known Neil - my present husband. At that time I was focused on my career until he proposed to me. I patiently waited for the approval and blessings of my beloved parents. So we got married in 1987 and I have a son and daughter. As you know the hotel industry is not a 9-5 job and consumes your time. However I managed to be a good mother and equally a supportive wife. Today my children are doing well in their own careers, and I am indeed a happy mother.

Q: Your challenges and progress made as a female manager
Rookamanie Fernando
A: I face my challenges with a positive attitude. I must thankfully recollect the kind support given to me by the late Herbert Cooray, present Chairman Hiran and his sister Shiromal and all my colleagues. At Jetwing we believe in teamwork. We operate on family values. A turning point in my hotel career was when I realized the potential of ayurveda and wellness. In 1992 I studied the deeper points of this subject for six months and gave a proposal to Chairman, who was mildly hesitant but gave me two rooms at Blue Oceanic. Soon the trend of decent spas caught on and I am delighted to say we built and opened the Jetwing Ayurveda Pavilion in 2001 at Negombo, with 12 rooms.
I was promoted General Manager of this property. Soon I was overlooking the spas of the entire Jetwing hotels. During my career I have travelled to about 15 countries, using my German language skills to promote Sri Lanka. I was surprised when Hiran Cooray asked me to take the reins of Jetwing Colombo. It was a new challenge but I am able to deliver beyond guest expectations.

Q: What inspires your success and your advice to aspiring young women in the hotel industry
A: I give all thanks to God, as I feel I am blessed. It is God who guides me. I always want to understand and connect with my staff- and transform their lives too. We are a team. I start each new day with prayer supplemented by a good attitude, passion and the desire to meet challenges. I never feel tired at work. I often speak at womens forums and propagate womens empowerment. Women must enter the hotel industry. They cannot be restricted by culture or any other stigma. I also want to see more women in the kitchen as creative chefs. If I were to describe my 3 decades as a hotelier I would say my passion to succeed carried me. I hope to remain with the Jetwing family and take this new hotel to greater heights as we have much healthy competition from other hotels including International brands.

## Title: Saving Fuel
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial
## Date: Monday, May 14, 2018 - 01:00
Saving Fuel
The upward revision of fuel prices was expected for quite some time, given the fact that crude oil prices in the world market have shot up to US$ 75 per barrel. When the National Unity Government reduced fuel prices soon after its victory in January 2015, the figure was around US$ 40 a barrel. Being mindful of the impact caused by a fuel price hike, the Government did hold on for several months incurring a heavy loss for the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), but that obviously could not continue in the long term. Fuel subsidies take a heavy toll on the economy, which is already burdened by other liabilities.
Sri Lanka, a net importer of oil, spends around US$ 4 billion a year on fuel every year. The demand for fuel has gone up due to several factors. There are more vehicles than ever on Sri Lankan roads, with more 35,000 new vehicles entering the road every month. All these vehicles require diesel and petrol, apart from the few electric cars registered every month. Another reason is the increased use of fossil fuels for power generation as hydropower resources have been affected by the drought.
In the light of the fuel price hike, we have to rethink our fuel usage and transport patterns. Being an emerging economy, we do have a love affair with the private car. Everyone wants one and being a free society, no one can stop people from buying cars and other vehicles. But what matters more is how we use them. We see hundreds of cars entering Colombo with only the driver on board, which naturally results in huge traffic jams. Some schools have 5,000 students and an almost equal number of cars can be seen near these schools in the morning and afternoon. One can just imagine how much fuel is consumed in this manner.
Many countries charge a fee from cars that have only the driver if they wish to enter the main city centre. This may not be practical here, but car owners should think of car pooling and ride sharing. There are local and international ride hailing firms in operation in Colombo and Kandy which already make it possible for a driver to pick up passengers heading the same way. Workers in offices can rotate their cars to come to work. These steps can obviously take a few hundred cars off the road.
But the best way to reduce our dependence on the private car is to have a modern, clean and efficient public transport system such as the proposed Colombo Light Rail Transit (LRT) system that will eventually have around seven lines. A Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system is also on the cards, whereby buses can use especially designated lanes and halts, even against oncoming traffic. Some countries allow public taxis and electric cars too to use this facility. A better public transport system is the only long-term answer to traffic congestion.
More concessions should be granted for the purchase of electric cars but the Government should also encourage the installation of solar powered electric car chargers. This will prevent electric cars being charged off the National Grid, which is mainly dependent on thermal power generation. That can negate any gains made by running a car on electricity. With the Government phasing out new registrations of petrol and diesel cars from 2040 in line with other countries such as India and UK, we have to rethink the electric car strategy.
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is another option we should look at. It is a cheap fuel to make and use, which is why it is so widespread in public transport in most countries. Its prices do not fluctuate all that much, making it ideal for developing countries. There are several advantages of having CNG vehicles which are now manufactured by many carmakers. On average CNG costs around half the amount of regular fuel and manufacturers claim 100 kilometres of driving will consume only around 3.5 kgs of CNG.
It is also a much greener fuel. The emissions and hydrocarbons that are released as a byproduct of CNG usage are lesser than those created by regular fuel. Since some cars run on both CNG and petrol, two tanks have to be accommodated. The upside is that the range is much better with two tanks, up to 1,400 Km.
In our region, the best example for CNG use is India, where Delhi and Mumbai are two major cities that actively encourage CNG powered cars and of course, public transport including taxis. It is a solution that greatly reduces environmental pollution.
Worldwide, energy companies and scientists are striving to make cleaner fuels, including bio-fuels (about which a debate is raging vis--vis the reduction of crops available for human consumption) and artificial fuels such as the recently unveiled Audi e-gas. Hydrogen fuel cell powered cars are just starting to appear in Japan and USA but will take at least 10 more years to go mainstream worldwide. In the meantime, we should all strive to save fuel, because every drop counts.

Sound ground-level administration a must  PM
Ground-level administration should function properly and unless it functions well, the entire system of governance in the country would be affected, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Galle.
The Prime Minister was speaking as chief guest at one of several functions held in connection with the opening of new administrative building complexes at divisional secretariats in Habaraduwa, Akmeemana, Gonapinuwala and Hikkaduwa, on Saturday. The entire project costs Rs. 206 million.
With the growth in administrative functions of divisional secretariats with the contemporary government policy of expanding development activities beyond townships to the village, the existing infrastructural facilities at these offices were not adequate.
So Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena launched a project to improve the facilities at divisional secretariats throughout the island, the Prime Minister said.
At the time of late President J.R. Jayewardenes rule, the then government established a large number of free trade zones (FTZs) in regions such as Gampaha, Katunayake, Biyagama, and Seethawaka.
However, it was late Presdient R. Premadasa, who as a minister of the Jayewardene government, proposed to shift the FTZs to rural areas, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
Subsequently, the first FTZ outside the Western Province was established at Koggala. After remedying a number of practical impediments that existed in the area, the Koggala FTZ was opened and was a great success, he said.
"Now the Koggala Free Trade Zone has the required number of factories and industries. At present about 25,000 to 30,000 youths are employed there."
We are planning to initiate a new FTZ in Weligama and the Southern Development Ministry has commenced preliminary work. With all these industrial development programmes, we have also given priority to develop tourism in the Galle district. These tourism projects will increase job opportunities for youth, the Prime Minister said.
Ministers Vajira Abeywardena and Gayantha Karunathilaka, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva, Deputy Minister J.C. Alawathugoda, Galle District MPs Bandula Lal Bandarigoda and Wijepala Hettiarachchi and Provincial Minister U.G.D. Ariyathilaka participated in the functions.

## Title: The square President

The square President
I was born in 1972, the year of the Watergate break-in, and so am too young to remember Richard Nixon in his presidential years. But I have often marvelled at the untrammelled hatred for the man among liberal Americans of an older generation. The reason for the loathing cannot have been ideology: Nixons conservatism was mostly attitudinal rather than ideological; he did not govern as a right-winger.
He cared almost exclusively about foreign policy, on which he held pragmatic (if complicated) views of an extremely high intellectual order, and more or less let centrist appointees run domestic cabinet agencies. Ive always thought this country could run itself domestically without a president, he said to an interviewer in 1968; all you need is a competent cabinet to run the country at home. You need a president for foreign policy.
Empirical evidence
Why the hatred, then He was often deceitful and in crucial respects unprincipled, but hardly less so than his predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, whom many modern biographers have gone out of their way to praise on the grounds that he expanded the American welfare state, though the empirical evidence of its success is lacklustre at best.
Nixon had his enemies spied on and used federal agencies to bully them, but other presidents, before and since, have done the same, and in any case hatred for Nixon long predated post-Watergate revelations of his paranoid vindictiveness.
John Farrell, in Richard Nixon: The Life, comes close to the answer when he observes, near the beginning of his account, that there is cool and there is square, and Richard Milhous Nixon was nothing if not square. Coolness  the quality of appearing self-possessed, at ease with oneself  became an essential part of democratic politics with the rise of television.
That happened roughly from the time Nixon was urged to run for Congress in 1945 (where Farrells book begins) to the time he was defeated by John Kennedy in the 1960 presidential contest. Nixons loss to Kennedy that year is often simplistically attributed to his poor performance in the first televised debate, but its true that the sleep-deprived Nixon appeared addled and shifty beside the poised Kennedy in this new visual medium. Particularly in his later years, Nixon was often bad on television. After he won the presidency in 1968, he appeared defensive and mean in televised events, and his attempts to appear relaxed  cool  came off badly.
Sense of humour
Nor did his appearance help. As a younger man Nixon was handsome enough, but the growth of those famous jowls in his middle years gave his appearance a graceless aspect that, combined with a one-dimensional sense of humour, made him seem, as Farrell has it, square. Half a century ago, US presidents didnt appear and speak publicly nearly as often as they do today, but even in the 1970s it must have been easy to grow tired of looking at Richard Nixon. For sophisticated people, he was easy to despise.
That hadnt always been so. The progression from light to darkness is the chief component of any biography of Nixon, but Farrell capably emphasizes his earlier generous outlook and ability to command the loyalty of subordinates and respect of voters. As a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee, for instance, Nixon combined sober anti-communism with winsomeness and intellectual probity.
Farrell rightly acknowledges both sides of the question of communism in mid-century America  on the one hand the governments of the United States and Great Britain had been penetrated by Soviet spies during World War II, some of whom stole valuable military secrets, and on the other hand the United States was never in danger of a Communist insurrection led by its flaky homespun Reds. In 1948 the bright and cheerful member from Californias 12th district offered an attractive contrast with the bigoted oaf John Rankin (Democrat of Mississippi) and the snivelling and corrupt J. Parnell Thomas (Republican of New Jersey). In one hearing recounted by Farrell, Arthur Garfield Hays of the generally left-wing American Civil Liberties Union sparred good-naturedly with Nixon, whose fairness, he said, confirms my faith in the American system of government.
Suspected spy
In 1948 Nixon, in the face of opposition from editorialists and Democrats and silence from Republicans, insisted on pursuing the committees case against the suspected spy Alger Hiss. The name means nothing to me, Hiss had answered when the committee asked him if hed ever known his accuser, the reformed spy Whittaker Chambers. In fact, Hiss did know Chambers, and as a high-level official in the State Department, Hiss had passed diplomatic secrets to the Russians. - Times Literary Supplement

Sri Lankas energy mix
On Friday, May 11, the Presidents office received a scathing email. *Ravi, like all other residents in Dehiwala, was irate over the frequent unannounced power outages. Ironically enough, power would be cut off in the evenings, long after working hours. This also meant that Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) hotlines would go unanswered.
Today marks a week since the same CEB engineers launched a work-to-rule campaign in protest over what they see as the states failure to ensure an uninterrupted power supply in the country. The industrial action also meant that workers would do the bare minimum regardless of the consequences.
Ravi eventually received a reply, albeit after ringing the highest echelons of the government. The response to his query, however, didnt come in the form of an assurance that the issue would be looked into. Instead he was told to expect seven to eight hours of power outages daily. And that it might be wise for him to invest in a generator.
Act of sabotage
The Norochcholai plant.
Ravi is not alone in this predicament. Over the last week alone, power outages have reported from parts of Malabe, Thalawathugoda, Rajagiriya and Wellawatte. Its an act of sabotage, a CEB unionist tells the Daily News. Why else would most power outages occur in the evenings, when the chances of hotlines being answered or the problems being fixed are remote
He compares the power outages to the street protests by students. If consumers arent inconvenienced, what is the point of strike actions
Head of the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union (CEBEU) Saumya Kumarawadu rationalized that the cost of generating electricity has been on the rise since 2015 resulting in the CEB incurring heavy losses. Last year, the CEB incurred a loss of Rs. 45 billion and this year we expect it to surpass Rs. 50 billion. The generation cost in 2015 stood at Rs 15.06/kwh with the addition of the Norochcholai Power Plant (300 MW) to the grid at the end of 2014. Since then, no new plants have been added to the grid, and coupled with the prevailing drought and the need to resort to more diesel power plants, the cost had risen to Rs 21.32/kwh by 2017.
Rising demand for power
True to his claims, Sri Lanka policymakers are acutely aware of the rising demand for electricity. In 2016, total installed power generation capacity of the country was 4,018 MW, consisting of 1,384 MW of coal power, 1,215 MW of oil burning thermal power, 1,384 MW of hydro power and 519 MW of non-conventional renewable energy sources such as wind, mini hydro, biomass and solar power plants. The annual total electricity demand is about 14,150 GWh. The overall annual demand for electricity is expected to increase by 6 to 8 percent, a number constrained by high prices.
Sri Lankas ambitious plans to add 500mw of electricity to the national grid through the Sampur Power plant in 2015 came to a grinding halt when activists lobbied against the project citing environmental concerns. The appalling state of the Lakvijaya Power Plant (Norochcholai Power Plant) amplified the need to reassess if the country was prepared to have another coal power plant. Ultimately the Sampur Power Project was reduced to a mere political commitment.
This is precisely the crux of the work-to-rule campaign, Athula Wanniarachchi, executive committee member of the CEBEU said. At any point in time, a country should either be building a power plant or ensuring that the growing demands for energy are met. We are not doing either and it is clear that we are heading for a power crisis.
Long Term Generation Plan
The Unions actions also come in the wake of them not being able to resolve issues with the utility regulator, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), which granted conditional approval for a Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) prepared by the CEB. In various documents which are available on the public domain, the PUCSL cites factual errors and calls for explanations. The document has been sent back and forth with the PUCSL requesting the CEB to make amends. In many instances, the PUCSL demands that the CEB prepare a generation mix which also includes LNG and other renewable sources of energy without being overly dependent on coal.
Clear policy directive
Who is the PUCSL to prepare and suggest changes to the Long Term Generation Plan They are not even engineers, says Wanniarachchi. If this plan had been approved when it was first submitted, we wouldnt even find ourselves in this position.
Bringing an end to this protracted issue is a Joint Cabinet Memorandum submitted by the Special Assignments Ministry and Power and Renewable Energy Ministry. The memorandum, as Power and Renewable Energy State Minister Ajith P. Perera says, is a policy proposal on the way forward.
The LTGP should be reviewed every two years. However, the one prepared by the CEB has been modified completely by the PUCSL which CEB has refused to accept, the policy document details. The policy directive which was approved by Cabinet last week cites that the composition of the energy mix should be 30 percent LNG, 30 percent high efficient coal, 25 percent large hydro, and 15 percent furnace oil which is a by-product of sources from refineries and non-conventional renewable energy sources which can be used for firm power.
Super critical coal for Sri Lanka
The policy paper clearly sets out the composition and there should be no disagreement thereafter, the State Minister said. Pertaining to the issue of coal, the policy advocates for the use of for the use of clean coal technologies using super critical or ultra-super critical coal, since coal remains the best least cost electricity generation option.
As coal power remains the least cost option, it has been decided that coal power should be there in the energy mix of the country, the Cabinet paper no 21/2018/PE goes on to state. Since environmental conservation is a prime policy, it has been proposed to employ clean coal technologies using super critical or ultra-super critical coal.
The Cabinet paper cites that since renewable energy was the prime policy of the government, at least 50 percent of the electricity demand should be met by the use of major hydro power plants and other non-conventional renewable energy sources.
Developing the non-conventional renewable energy sources to the maximum feasible level meeting, around one-third of the electricity requirement of the country (2500 mw) using non-conventional renewable energy sources by 2030, it reads.
The Cabinet paper, however, does not detail the megawatts which would encompass the percentages given. The Joint Cabinet Memorandum submitted by the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry and Special Assignments Ministry also cites that the Power Ministry has submitted a report to the National Economic Council in April stressing that the powers for preparing policies for the electricity sector be vested with the relevant minister and Cabinet only.
Sources at the PUCSL stated that the CEB may now have to prepare a fresh plan based on the policy directive. When queried from the unionists, they argued that there isnt a need for a new plan and that the PUCSL should merely approve what has been sent to them in the first place. They demand the following: approval be granted to the CEBs LCLTGEP 2018-2038 plan; immediate action be taken to allocate lands to build low-cost power plants; and a proper mechanism to provide a government subsidy to the CEB for incurring losses as a result of no new power plants being built. Among other demands, they are also call for the amendment of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No 20 of 2009 appropriately to remove the unnecessary impediments for the proper functioning of the CEB. We wont give up the campaign until that happens, Wanniarchchi said.
According to the PUCSL, delay in implementation of the LGTP has serious financial repercussions. The total expected financial loss due to implementation delays of the 2018-2020 plant schedule in the Long Term Generation Expansion Plan is Rs. 50.62 billion. The financial loss due to any further delay beyond what is forecasted in the previous section will be Rs. 3.43 billion for each month.

Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year delves into a new treasure
Sri Lankan maidens to bag their cricket Oscars
In what will be a first in Sri Lanka, schoolgirl cricketers will hobnob and rub shoulders in their Sunday best with the countrys elite brand of future stars when they come on stage to pick up their Oscars for a showing in the concluded 2018 inter-school season.
Sans gender discrimination they will take their rightful places at this years Mobitel-Sunday Observer Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer Awards ceremony that is into its 40th glorious year, long enough to inspire the shows organisers and promoters that it is time the girls too come out to showcase their wares. As many as 38 girls schools in the country, including the far flung north, play cricket with every endeavour and passion to match up to the boys and the new concept introduced by the Sunday Observer and Mobitel is expected to bring out more girls who could feel wanted and not wasted for their talents.
With the sports custodians, Sri Lanka Cricket, moving forward with a project to promote cricket in girl schools, it is no coincidence that the Sunday Observer and Mobitel have teamed up to reward the best girls in town who until now could have only had fairy-tale dreams.
Girls who have excelled at this years tournament representing schools all over the island will be rewarded just like the boys after a panel of experts examine their performances and single them out for laurels and trophies.
One school that is likely to nudge the panel of judges will be Devapathiraja College in the rustic environs of Galle who have won the girls title for three years running from 2015 to 2018.
They will easily become perhaps the first school to take cricket to more girls and places in the country than anybody else in the past.

Sri Lankans dominate IFS global workforce
Shirajiv Sirimane
The technology education offered by Sri Lankan universities are of very high standard and this was the reason for IFS to open its office in Colombo 20 years ago, said Martin Gunnarsson, Director of Research and Strategy at IFS.
A frequent visitor to Colombo, he said today IFS has also set up its Research and Development Lab in Sri Lanka and employs the highest number of graduates. Out of the nearly 3,000 global workforce of IFS, over 1,000 are from Sri Lanka.
He said that high tech education is a key for development of the country and Sweden is the best example for it.
Gunnarsson said that Sweden has a 10 million population and children when they are out of school can speak three languages mainly, English German and French. This is because they know that without languages they dont have a future. 
Sweden can proudly say that they have invented in Skype, Minecraft (gaming) and several other world famous products and all these are as a result of focused education and dedication by its people to produce something novel.
He said that in Sri Lanka too the knowledge of youth are very high but more should be done to extract the knowledge and put it to better use. This is what we are doing at IFS and I am glad to say that the IFS Sri Lanka Lab has introduced several ground braking systems.
He said that the key to the success for IFS labs is they have given the freedom to their employees to innovate. These are failures but we at IFS know that you cannot innovate without failures. We tell them think big and start small.
IFS labs are inspired by consumer technologies, digital trends and innovative solutions in a wide range of industries, applying them to IFS products and the other labs are located in Sweden, Poland and Brazil.
Beyond the regular product development, focusing on adding dialogues and completing, the Sri Lankan IFS Lab team too has a major role to play towards creating the Aurena Bot powered by artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
Recently, IFS announced the IFS Aurena Bot. It lets you interact with IFS Applications to perform simple but effective dialogues such as Call in Sick and many other applications that allow an employee to interact with office from home.
Built to help customers capitalize on disruptive industry trends such as automation, connected devices (IoT), and servitization, IFS Aurena Bot helps companies connect their business to a digital backbone.
Meanwhile IFS, the global enterprise applications company, announced the findings of its report on enterprise mobility within UK organisations.
The results find that employee enablement, rather than customer engagement, is the key driver behind mobility schemes and application roll-outs.
The study of 200 CIOs and IT Managers from medium to large corporations found that, while over half (59%) of respondents are investing in mobile business applications for customers, the proportion investing in business applications for employees is larger at over two thirds (71%). Businesses are predominantly focused on rolling out personal productivity apps along with those that support job-specific functions, such as expenses, timesheets or document management, with a view to helping employees access corporate data and remain productive on the move.
The majority of organisations (76%) have discovered clear benefits to investing in mobility schemes, with the main drivers being powering a flexible workforce (83%), boosting productivity (68%) and delivering competitive advantage (42%). Of the businesses that havent invested in mobility, 75% claim that these schemes are not yet business-critical.

Gunnarsson, Director of Research and Strategy at IFS, said, The survey backs up the experience in our customer base. Our customers tell us that enterprise software mobility schemes are a fundamental investment which enable them to drive measureable business benefits. Most employees today have mobile access to mails and calendars. However, 25% of our customers running IFS Applications 8 also chose to run IFS business apps to take action on ERP-related types of information, such as purchase orders, invoices, time and travel expense reporting. Outcomes include boosting productivity via enabling a remote workforce and facilitating smarter decision making by speeding up the flow of relevant information.
Mobile security is a major concern for all organisations in the study (86%), yet this is not stopping them from investing in some form. Manufacturing and production is a clear front-runner with 95% investing, while retail, distribution and transport is slower to adopt at 47%.
Interestingly, the demand for mobility schemes is so high that many employees are contravening corporate policies to access business information on personal devices. Many organisations that dont allow employees to access corporate data on their device are aware that this policy is being overlooked or ignored. 63% are aware of employees accessing business emails on their devices, 15% customer/client information and 14% company reports.
The results show that the demand for mobility schemes is coming from employees who are prepared to disregard corporate rules to access business information on their own devices, putting confidential information at risk. A better approach is to invest in business apps, mobile device fleets and BYOD schemes to enable secure access to the data employees are demanding, said Martin.
IFS is observing increasing demand from customers who want to incorporate ERP into mobility schemes, with the majority wanting to better support a large distribution of remote assets and staff, added Martin. The main driver is a need to ensure that the entire business is kept up to date with the most accurate information to enable better decision making on the move.
The survey was conducted in partnership with Vanson Bourne with 200 CIOs and IT managers taking part from UK-based companies in multiple sectors with at least 1,000 employees.

Tea Talks on The Chitra Lane Way
The Chitra Lane Way, a recently launched book about bringing up children; especially those with special needs, was the centre of a fascinating discussion that took place as part of the Tea Talks series held at Maniumpathy boutique hotel.
Authored by well known and respected Clinical Psychologist Nishalie Fernandopulle, The Chitra Lane Way documents the experiences and insights she has gained during her decade of work at the Chitra Lane School.
This book describes the various stages and milestone of a childs development and lets parents know what they need to be aware of at every stage. In that sense it is a book that can serve as a valuable guide for any parent, not just those who have children with special needs. Of course, special needs children are the main focus, and we have called on our years of experience to document the methods, interventions and management techniques that we have found to be most helpful and holistic when it comes to caring for and educating children with special needs, Fernandopulle said.
Founder of the organization, Delysia Gunewardene, who continues to devote her time to guide and inspire the Chitra Lane family, was also present and offered in depth insights into the book When Chitra Lane started over four decades ago, there was nowhere for parents of children with special needs to turn to for help and support. We started with a single room, and now, we reach out to over 2,000 students across the country annually. This book shares the experience we have had and the knowledge we have gained, and we hope that it will serve as a tool for the parents, educators and caregivers of these very special children, so that we ensure that we do everything we can to give them the gift of independence, and help them reach their full potential, Gunewardene said.
The talk was the third in a series of Tea Talks held at Maniumpathy Boutique Hotel, a property of Manor House Concepts. As always, the talk was structured to allow a small group of individuals to come together and enjoy an insightful inspirational conversation.

Three separate investigations are conducted by the Police, NHDA, and Anuradhapura Government Agent into the alleged destruction of archaeological monuments at Balumgala in the Ipologama Divisional Secretariat Division.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayaka said that after an initial investigation, the Ipologama Divisional Secretary was transferred to Palugaswewa.
The GA said the lot 15 and 17 of the Pugollagma final village plan were damaged with the excavation. He said the Plot 17 is an archaeological reservation to the extent of 2.464 hectares and the Plot 17 is about 28.779 hectares. He said these plots can be used for public needs.
However, Anuradhapura Additional Government Agent Keerthi Gamage said the Divisional Secretary has provided only the recommendations. Anuradhapura District Archaeology Director S. Senanayke said a complaint was lodged at the office regarding the unauthorized excavations at the 15-acre land and that irreparable damages were caused to archaeological monuments in the process. He said an investigation into the issue will be held and the value of the damaged monuments would be recovered from the responsible parties.

Two members of the Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha (PS) were arrested for creating a tense situation during the opening of the Weligama Polathumodera bridge built with JAICA aid on May 11, Weligama Police said.
The two Pradeshiya Sabha members belonging to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), were arrested for obstructing police duties. They were produced before the Matara Magistrate and were subsequently remanded until May 17, police said.
They added that Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake was due to open the new bridge. Before the scheduled time, Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Pushpakumara Battage had arrived on the scene with a group PS members around 9.30 a.m. and had attempted to unveil the memorial plaque of the new bridge, arguing that the project had been launched by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
A tense situation began when police took steps to remove the said members from the location.
Minister Sagala Ratnayake later arrived with other invitees and formally opened the bridge.
The minister, speaking to the media, said it was natural for succeeding governments to carry out development work initiated by previous regimes to a conclusion and to open them for public benefit. He said the Southern Expressway project, which was previously launched by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, was opened by President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
They were now opening the bridge launched by Rajapaksa, after completing it. The Right To Information Act had enabled people to inquire on the waste of funds made by the previous regime, to hold tamashas to mark opening ceremonies. The present government did not incur unnecessary expenditures for opening ceremonies of the nature as every possible saving was made to provide public relief. Unlike the Rajapaksa regime, the present government did not engage in deceitful politics, he added.
Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Sugunama was also present on the occasion. After the opening ceremony, Minister Sagala Ratnayake, accompanied by the Japanese Ambassador and other invitees, inspected three more bridges under construction in the area with Japanese aid.

War heroes must not be used to gain political mileage - President
President Maithripala Sirisena says it is not ethical for a political party to use war heroes to further their own political agenda in any way.
The President made these remarks unveiling the Wayamba Rana Abhiman War Heroes Monument in Kurunegala, Friday evening (11).
The new monument has been established to replace war heroes monument removed due to the Kurunegala - Dambulla main road development project. Under the guidance of the North - Western Provincial Council, the Road Development Authority and Ranaviru Seva Authority this monument had been erected near the Maligapitiya ground, Kurunegala, where the previous monument was located. Construction work of the memorial have been carried out by the Corps of Engineer Services (CES) of the Sri Lanka Army.
This war memorial displays all the names of the war heroes of the North-Western Province who sacrificed their lives to protect the motherland.The entire project has been completed at a cost of Rs 27 million.
Even though this war memorial was removed to make way for the road development project, during the past period some section of the society attempted to give a political interpretation stating that the government had forgotten the war heroes and had removed their memory.
A few protests were also organised opposing this move and when the President visited Kurunegala to attend a ceremony in August 31, 2016 he promised to establish a more creative war heroes memorial at the place.The new monument was erected to fulfill the pledge given by the President and the foundation stone laid on November 30, 2016 to create this monument.
President Sirisena said the present government at any time did not work to undermine war heroes but always tried to ensure their rights and accorded them the honour on behalf of the nation.
The President rejected all accusations towards the government regarding war heroes. He said that all these statements are meant to make the government uncomfortable.
Even though the government is accused of victimising the real soldier, the victimisation occurred during the past regime and the present government has fulfilled its responsibilities with the support of international cooperation to secure the pride of the soldiers.
The President said the present government took action to put an end to the talk of an electric chair and bringing foreign judges into the country to hear cases against our war heroes.
"Even though certain members of the army were taken into custody for investigation purposes, it is not in anyway hunting soldiers and no soldier who has protected the country was harmed and the government has worked towards giving them the highest respect," the President said.
Co-operative Development Provincial Minister Piyasiri Ramanayake presented the cheque of financial donation made by the North-Western Province Co-operative members through the War Heroes Welfare Fund to build the War Heroes Memorial, to the President and later the president handed over it to the North-Western Province Chief Secretary G.B.M. Sirisena.
North Western Province Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake presented a souvenir which included the structure of the War Heroes Memorial.

War inscription exhibition
The thirty year Civil War in Sri Lanka claimed the lives of almost 24,000 military personnel. However though these lives have been lost, the literature they leave behind give us an insight as to how they spent their last days and their thoughts.
Their ghostly inscriptions and poems have been engraved on their helmets, trees, bunkers, and in destroyed buildings. Just before they died, these were the thoughts that entered their minds  about their wives, parents, friends who died and their children.
These writings can be termed as War Literature and is common in regions throughout the world that are in a state of military conflict or where the conflict has ended. Such inscriptions were seen in the Vietnam War and World War II. These are very emotional and thought provoking, said Veteran Journalist, Director of Documentaries, Charith Kiriella.
An exhibition will be held on June 30 at Malay Street Defense Services College at 9.30am exhibiting these inscriptions collected from earlier war torn areas. It will be opened by Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake.
A Press Conference was held at Rock House Army Camp Modera auditorium last Wednesday to reaveal this event. Brand Ambassador for ARYA Foundation, Roshan Mahanama and Former Army Commander Shantha Kottegoda attended the event.
This exhibition will be held to enlighten the public about these war heroes who have served our country sacrificing their lives which is the ultimate sacrifice. However as Kiriella pointed out, even though so many soldiers have lost their lives in the Sri Lankan Civil War, there is very little literature about them and very little movies.
We have visited these regions and documented these inscriptions. We have collected them in Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya and Jaffna over time. So we are planning to have an exhibition where these inscriptions can be viewed by the public. This exhibition is called Bunker Kurutu Gee Exhibition held for the first time in Sri Lanka, said Kiriella.
I wrote a book called 90 Kokavil. It is going around the world. Now it is being launched in Melbourne on May 10. My book documents how Sri Lankan Troops defended the Kokavil Rupavahini Communication tower. They came under a severe LTTE attack. But courageous Captain Aladeniya and his troops did not give in, stayed back offering resistance and finally laid down their lives, Kiriella added.

Water vigour
No, Dickwella and the Hoo-maniya Blowhole is not the perverted name of a new punk band, but the twin objects of our first day trip outside of Tangalla. The blowhole is a natural wonder formed by cliffs along the coast, and Dickwella is a frantic coastal town where activity can reach a level of absurdity.
First up was Dickwella, where later wed be visiting the Wewurukanalla Temple. We hadnt actually expected to linger in the town, but were instantly caught in its current, flailing our arms uselessly while being swept through jam-packed streets.
This was New Years Day, which probably explains the ridiculous number of people on the street, but seriously. Not only was every sidewalk and shop jam-packed, but everyone was in a abnormally good mood.
We soon found ourselves in Dickwellas Market, spread out along the beach. Half of Sri Lankas population was there, selling fruits, veggies, knives, spices, t-shirts and underwear, and the other half was there buying it.
A few kilometers back towards Tangalla is the Hoo-maniya Blowhole, a rock formation that mysteriously shoots spouts of water straight into the air. There was an entrance fee for foreigners and a large, modern visitors center which we were asked to tour all of which seems a little overwrought for a blowhole. But fine, well take a peek; yes, thats a marvelous scale model of the blowhole you have there!
The seas were unfortunately calm, but an explosion of water did eventually happen. When a large enough wave moves into the narrow crevice of rock, a low sound (the Hoo which gives Hoo-maniya half its name) heralds the coming of a water spout. Its a cool natural phenomenon and must be amazing during monsoon season, when the water can shoot up to fifteen meters into the sky.

Why we need a massive education reform
I was happy to see that The World Bank (WB) Board of Executive Directors has approved a US $100 million credit to support Sri Lankas efforts to strengthen and modernise its education system. It said: The General Education Modernization Project (GEM) will modernize and diversify the curriculum of general education in keeping with the transformation taking place in Sri Lankas society and economy. Greater emphasis will be on strategic subjects that are key for economic development such as English and Mathematics.
Only a few weeks ago I campaigned for a mass education programme for those who want to acquire a working knowledge of English language. English is available throughout Lanka but it does not come down to the working people. They are looking for it, earnestly; because it will empower them in social activity and labour market. I started from the Prime Minister and went around to meet several relevant ministers; also education specialists. At least one reason why some debates on politics of Marxism go down to the proletariat is lack of English at that level.
Some Polpotian Marxists repeat This is a new, a new situation, and a new and higher level of struggle left behind by neoliberalism and new priorities corresponded to it. Globally the bourgeois-democratic stage had passed, and with it, the formal legal demand for national self-determination  characteristic of this stage  lost its former significance.
Polpotian Marxists
Hence the slogan overthrow the rule of the bourgeoisie on a world scale and set up the international dictatorship of the proletariat became the immediate practical slogan. Therefore, the concentration on national democratic tasks is outdated. This means that national self-determination lost all significance. So Polpotian Marxists in Lanka are preparing an immediate red revolution that could replace all democracy slogans with the self-determination of the proletariat. This would have been to ignore the presence of backward countries like Sri Lanka which had not completely passed through the stage of the bourgeois-democratic national revolution.
There was a massive struggle in Lanka for self-rule by Tamil nationality in Lanka and Polpotian Marxists launch a counter-revolution under the pretext of Desa Premi- patriotic movement. The result is a defeat for all with the devastation of the entire country.
The problem is not over and the second struggle has started. Liberal bourgeoisie led by the government has started a devolution and democracy programme with the intention of changing the constitution with constituent assembly. This is backed by the political leadership of minority nationalities. They hope to launch a Gandhian mass action to compel the government to go forward. Lankan proletariat led by Sama Samajists and other left leaders campaign for this effort.
As Lenin said The modern proletariat of advanced countries had to support these movements; with all its strength it had to struggle so that the accumulation of centuries of ill will and the distrust by backward people of the dominant nations  and of the proletariat of these nations  was overcome as quickly as possible. It was impossible to achieve this goal without proclaiming and conducting in practice the right of national self-determination.
Moreover, even for a socialist society moving towards the elimination of classes the question of national self-determination still remains a real one, since although based on economics, socialism by no means consists solely of economics.
For the elimination of national subjugation, a necessary foundation is a socialist production, but it is also necessary to have a democratic organisation of the state; a democratic army etc. erected on this base. So, we see that Marxist teachers always stood for democracy contrary to Polpotian Marxists who have betrayed the fundamental principles of Marxism.
Eliminating national subjugation
By transforming capitalism into socialism the proletariat creates the possibility of eliminating national subjugation.
This is one of the pet phrases of Polpotian; but how on the earth people can construct socialism if they havent got the freedom that comes with democracy. Polpotian who construct one party one leader states of terror claim that all proletarians accept such terror regimes, as a protection from imperialist armed attacks.
This argument again should be accepted without any debate, international or local. On the other hand, this possibility of socialism with democracy is transformed into reality only  only upon the full establishment of democracy in all areas, the determination of borders according to the sympathies of the population, and the full freedom of secession. On this base, in its turn, the absolute elimination of the least national frictions and distrust develops in practice.
The accelerated movement towards the integration of nations will be completed when the state withers away.
The concept of the right of self-determination is difficult to understand and it needs time and effort. It cannot be digested in a situation of hate and repulsion. Polpotians, in their simplicity and terror mentality, are unable to understand the national problem. In this short discussion, attempt is made to show what rich material available for the study of the revolutionary dialectical approach to questions of law related to self-determination.

Worlds biggest puppy
You might be a dog lover but you cant love them as much as Marcus Curtis, who spends his time bringing extinct dog breeds to life. The breeder creates some of the worlds biggest puppies and sells them for $5,000 (3,500) each.
Among his litter of huge dogs is Euphrates, dubbed the worlds largest puppy, at almost 13 stones and six feet tall when on hind legs. The ancient molossus (a mixed breed derived from Europe from 5,000BC) was named after the river near their home in Riverside, California.
Through selective breeding of the Neapolitan mastiff and English bull mastiff, the first litter of molossus was born last year.
Now at 10 months old, the five dogs consume up to 12 cups of food a day or two whole chickens. Not everyone is too happy about Marcuss breeding of the large dogs, with some accusing him of playing God.
Marcus says that the giant pets predate a lot of other breeds and are healthier, live longer and are well sized.
Im not creating a new breed, Im resurrecting a great, great breed that already existed. When I found out that the original molossus breed was not a fighting dog but a pure guardian to protect children, the family and other animals, I thought they were a perfect breed. They lasted thousands of years as a success, I thought it could be an all-round win for mankind now. It has been a dream come true watching the dogs mature and being embraced, weve been overwhelmed, its been a fun ride.
Marcus first started researching the breed eight years ago, beginning by looking into their nature and descendants.
He added, I was in shock when I saw the statues at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which shows them with their massive bodies, cropped ears, tails and loose skin. After doing more research I found out more about their personalities, what they were used for and it was really intriguing.
Marcus set about bringing the breed back to life  carefully selecting dogs based on their health history, size and temperament. He carefully chose canines that would give the Molossus the best gene pool in the hopes of success. Since the first litter was born, Marcus claims that people all over the world have inquired about the American Molossus. Metro

Anuradhapura Assistant Agrarian Development Commissioner Asanka Somawansa said water in nearly 3,200 small tanks would be preserved for drinking. Farmer organizations say water of the major tanks are at a low level.
The Mahakandarawa, Abaya Wewa, Padaviya, Huruluwewa and Nachchaduwa tanks do not have adequate water, they lament.
Only 30 percent of the 78,000 hectares could be cultivated under the present conditions, Asanka said.
However, farmers now can purchase 50 kg of subsidized fertilizer at Rs. 500 from the 42 Agrarian Development Centres. The National Fertilizer Secretariat has made arrangements to provide adequate fertlizer to the Anuradhaprua District. But farmers are not showing much interest in buying fertlizer for the Yala cultivation, he said. Meanwhile, about 70,000 drought affected families in Anuradhapura undergo severe difficulties since they did not receive compensation with the subsequent restriction imposed on them with the circular issued by the Disaster Management Ministry.
In March, 131,000 drought affected families received dry food ration. But now, only 59,420 families are granted them.
