Hafeez, Imad back in Pakistan's ODI squad for NZ series
LAHORE friday: Allrounders Mohammad Hafeez and Imad Wasim staged a comeback Friday in Pakistan's 15-member squad for the three-match one-day series against New Zealand.
Hafeez, 38, who is a veteran of 200 one-day internationals, missed out on Pakistan's one-day series in Zimbabwe in July this year and was also left out of the Asia Cup in September.
But he showed good form in the 3-0 Twenty20 series win against Australia and in the first Twenty20 match against New Zealand -- both in the United Arab Emirates -- to force his way back in the side.
Wasim has not been part of the one-day squad since Pakistan's series against Sri Lanka in October last year, and has been plagued by fitness problems.
The first two one-day internationals will be played in Abu Dhabi on 7 and 9 November, with the third in Dubai on 13 November. Pace spearhead Mohammad Amir has been left out of the squad since his unimpressive performance in the Asia Cup where he went wicketless in three matches.
Opener Shan Masood was surprisingly dropped from the Asia Cup squad despite not playing a single match and scoring hundreds in each innings for Pakistan 'A' against New Zealand 'A' in the four-day game in Dubai this week.

ODI series win in Sri Lanka shows why they are the best :
How England went from forlorn rabble to indisputable favourites
Despite last Tuesdays dead rubber producing their heaviest-ever defeat, their 3-1 series victory in Sri Lanka was their ninth one-day international series win in a row and their 14th out of 17 since the 2015 World Cup.
They have totally reinvented themselves since being eliminated in the group stages of that tournament. Their one-day game was stuck in the dark ages. Now it is trailblazing.
England, the world number one ODI side, are superbly poised to overturn their miserable World Cup record - despite reaching the final three times, they have never won the competition.
This is how Eoin Morgans side have leapt from a forlorn rabble to indisputable favourites for the 2019 World Cup on home soil.
JUST HOW GOOD ARE THEY
England have only lost series to South Africa away (3-2) and India away (2-1) in the past three years and have since beaten both sides at home, while they also lost 3-2 to Australia following the 2015 Ashes.
Their run rate of 6.23 since the last World Cup is the best of any team. They do concede 5.62 runs an over - higher than every other side except Sri Lanka - but their batsmen seem capable of overcoming anything.
They have the best opening partnership in the world - Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow have scored 1,309 runs in 22 matches at an average of 59.50, with five century stands. They are a rocket launch pad for some astronomical scores.
Importantly, England now seem equally at home batting first or second. Of their 32 ODI victories in the past two years, 15 have been won batting first and 17 batting second.
Demolishing an admittedly weakened Australia 5-0 at home was impressive, but better was the previous 4-1 win down under against their first-choice team.
That and winning the deciding game in the three-match series against a feared India side in July suggests they are ready for the biggest challenge of all.
POWER BATTING RIGHT DOWN THE ORDER
England have twice broken the world record ODI score in the past three years, first with 444 against Pakistan in 2016 and then 481 against Australia last year.
They are a truly intimidating batting order and have scored 300 or more 32 times in the past three years, more times than any other side - India are a distant second with 18.
This all comes from being perennially positive - Morgan calls it shooting the lights out. Their depth in batting - even Adil Rashid at nine and Liam Plunkett at 10 can offer rapid bouts of scoring - gives everyone confidence to just go for it.
With his dispassionate destruction of bowling attacks, Jos Buttler is the most feared one-day batsman in the modern game. He can totally transform a match in 10 overs. No other team has someone who has his range and is that uncontainable. Perhaps the most impressive thing about Englands batting is that none of this is achieved through slogging or outrageous risks. The phenomenal scoring rate is maintained with the positive application of mostly conventional cricket shots - Roy and Buttler excepted - many all along the ground. They know not to over-hit or throw themselves off balance. Their batting is more about striking hard, fast and clean from a stable, steady base. It is clinical, controlled and crushing.
WICKET-TAKING BOWLERS ASSERT CONTROL
Englands bowling is their less celebrated suit, with no truly fearsome operators, but they have an assembly of very effective wicket-takers and the best way of arresting the scoring is to break opposition partnerships.
Chris Woakes bowls a lively and probing fast-medium pace and is uber-reliable in the first powerplay. He and South Africa fast bowler Kagiso Rabada have taken the most wickets in the first 10 overs since the last World Cup, with 33 apiece.
The control, adaptability and penetration of spin twins Rashid and Moeen Ali is Englands other major asset. Taking pace off is the big foil to power hitters in one-day cricket and they do this highly effectively. They are also both equally proficient bowling at any stage of the innings and complement each other superbly.
Off-spinner Moeen is accurate and reliable, and generally gives batsmen no easy options. He bowls tightly to his field and varies his pace subtly. Batsmen rarely take liberties with him. Rashid has excellent control - conceding only 5.41 runs an over this year - and confidence in his variations.
His googly is beautifully disguised and few batsmen pick it, while his ability to spin the ball away from both right and left-handers is invaluable. The leg-spinner took 42 ODI wickets in 2018, second only to John Emburey (43 in 1987) for an England spinner in a calendar year.
Plunkett and Ben Stokes are adept in the middle overs at taking valuable wickets just as opponents are trying to accelerate. They are both quick enough to surprise batsmen and show intelligent changes of pace. Plus Plunkett is exceptionally phlegmatic in the face of assault, a major asset.
With David Willeys left-arm, Mark Woods zip and enthusiasm, Tom Currans clever slower balls and Joe Roots canny variations, Morgan has an impressive cast of bowlers.
CAPTAIN FANTASTIC PUTS THE TEAM FIRST
Morgan revels in his role as number four and captain. His batting goes through occasional dips but he doesnt let it worry him and will suddenly recapture his mojo when you least expect it.
He had a horror run playing for Middlesex in September but against Sri Lanka reeled off a succession of dominant innings and finished with an average of 195.
He is Englands ballast, able to kickstart an innings if it has faltered or add a turbo thrust in the later stages. He always puts the teams interests first.
He had become a slow starter but has worked hard recently on rotating the strike early in his innings and it paid off in Sri Lanka - his strike rate in that series was 105.40. In the field he is reassuringly ice-cool, hugely experienced and smart with his bowling changes. He will immediately change tack if a plan is not working and everyone trusts him to do that.
He enjoys the massive respect of the team and constantly emphasises the importance of fun when playing and touring, which relaxes everyone. Properly celebrating wins is an important element of his leadership style.
STRENGTH IN DEPTH - THE ENVY OF THE WORLD
Such is the power of Englands batting that Alex Hales cannot get into the first-choice team. With six ODI hundreds and a strike rate of 95.65 he would walk into any other side.
It is wonderful for England to have someone of his calibre and experience in the wings. It keeps everyone else on their toes.
Tom Curran, his brother Sam and the recently introduced Olly Stone illustrate the depth of Englands bowling resources. The competition for places is intense.
There is also the eminently reliable slow left-armer Liam Dawson in case there is an injury to Moeen or Rashid.
Englands squad of 18 is the envy of the world. Practically all apart from Rashid and Hales are brilliant fielders too. Paul Collingwood would not stand out in this side.
CAN ENGLAND ACTUALLY WIN THE WORLD CUP
In the past England have shown a fallibility in knockout group matches, but that will not be so severely tested in the 2019 World Cup.
They play each of the other nine teams once and the best four sides progress to the semis. They must be a near certainty to make one of those four spots.
Then it will be down to performing on the day. There is more chance of them doing that now given their consistency, experience and stability. Coaches Trevor Bayliss and Paul Farbrace worked out long ago that World Cup-winning teams average at least 60 ODI appearances per player. They have a squad with that experience now, with a range of fantastic skills and immense confidence, and they are astutely led.
They just need to continue working hard, pushing each other and believing in themselves.
If they dont win a World Cup at home with this group of players, it is hard to see how they ever will.

Three-day practice game ends in draw after first day wash out
Lahiru Kumara warms up for Test   rattles Englands top order
Test fast bowler Lahiru Kumara warmed up for the first Test against England with an impressive opening spell of bowling for Sri Lanka Board XI on the second day of the second 2-day warm-up match which ended in a draw at the CCC grounds yesterday.
The 21-year-old Kumara proved what a fine seamer he is when he removed three of Englands top order batsmen within the space of five balls to have England collapse from 28-0 to 28-3 before Keaton Jennings with a solid 45 in 33 overs and Ben Stokes taking on the spinners confidently to score 53 off 58 balls (6 fours, 1 six) figured in a 80-run stand on a slow sluggish pitch to stall the early collapse.
Jos Buttler (25), Ben Foakes (19 n.o.) and Sam Curran using his feet to the spinners to score an unbeaten 48 off 50 balls (7 fours, 1 six) ensured England reached a respectable score of 210-6 in 50 overs before the innings was closed.
In the Board XIs reply of 200-7 in 50 overs two young cricketers Avishka Fernando and Charith Asalanka shone with some fine batting.
Fernando who took successive sixes off Sam Curran made a run a ball 47 inclusive of 7 fours and 2 sixes and Asalanka batted beautifully to score 68 off 64 balls with 3 sixes and 6 fours before retiring.
The match was reduced to a one-day affair after the first day was washed out by rain.
This is Englands final warm-up game before the three-Test series against Sri Lanka that commences at the Galle Stadium on Tuesday.

Lankan cricketers voluntarily declaring assets surprises Sports Minister
Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha stated that cricketers who are contracted under Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) are ready to voluntarily declare their assets annually. He made these remarks at the discussion with sports journalists at his Ministry yesterday.
This is remarkable, they volunteered to do it even though they are not legally bound to do so, the Minister said.
He further stated that there is no legal frame work to declare the assets legally for cricketers and he appreciated those who come forward to do so voluntarily. He said that this should be made compulsory for national athletes as well as administrators of National Sports Federations (NSF) to declare their assets and income statements.
I think it could do a lot of good for sports, said the Minister.
The Minister also urged the Media and Social Media users to refrain from publishing various misinformation about players unless they are charged by the ICC.
During my discussion with the Sri Lankan cricketers they expressed their unhappiness regarding some of the news going around where their names have been linked to ongoing ICC anti-corruption investigations. They were very much worried about it. The ICC carries out their investigations secretly and they do not publish any names until the person is charged, said the Minister.

Lewis Hamilton is the differentiator, says Mercedes boss Toto Wolff
Even by Lewis Hamiltons high standards, 2018 has been a phenomenal season.
The 33-year-old has showcased his talent throughout the year, pushing himself and the Mercedes car to the limit to win a fifth world championship.
Hamiltons unlikely victories in Monza and Singapore -- two tracks the faster Ferraris should have dominated at -- were the standout performances in arguably his best ever season in Formula One.
The lap that earned him pole at Singapore, Marina Bay, in particular, is arguably up there with the best drives of his entire career.
This is the best Lewis Hamilton I have seen in the last six years, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff told Formula1.com.
He has driven better, he has been better out of the car. Very, very complete.
With the Britons fifth title -- just the third man to ever achieve the feat -- 2018 only served to emphasize the gulf in class between Hamilton and the rest of the field.
[His biggest strength is] keeping his calm and holding his nerve, added Wolff. We had times when the car was good enough to win and times when the car was not good enough to win. But he was very stable.
Its arguable that Hamiltons previous title wins had a lot to do with Mercedes producing the best car on the grid.
But that wasnt the case for much of 2018 with rivals Ferrari boasting the superior machine.
As Wolff puts it, Hamilton has been the differentiator.
Its the ability of combining talent with hard work, intellect and emotional intelligence, he said. All great champions have all four of them.
If one is missing, you can still be a successful racing driver but you are never going to achieve this greatness.
Having won four of the last five F1 driver titles, talk has quickly turned to whether or not Hamilton can match, or even surpass, the great Michael Schumacher.
The Germans all-time record stands at seven world championships, a total most wouldnt bet against Hamilton reaching based on his imperious performance in 2018.
As long as he is in a good car and continues to enjoy it in the way he does today, there is more to come, reflected Wolff.
But the reason he has won the fifth championship is that he concentrates on the job in hand and does not look too far away. Because before you win a seventh there is a sixth to win, and we havent scored a single point for that one.  CNN

LIOC reduces Auto Diesel and Octane 92
Lanka IOC has revised prices of its auto fuels from midnight yesterday following a review of auto fuels by the government.
Lanka IOC has reduced the prices of Lanka Auto Diesel (LAD) by Rs.11 per litre to Rs.118 and Lanka Petrol 92 (LP 92) by Rs.2 per litre to Rs 153 per litre. Lanka IOC said the reduction in Diesel is in keeping with the interests of the public and channel partners in mind.
However, the company is still incurring losses on sale of petrol and diesel. Although, international oil prices came down during the current month but due to substantial depreciation of Sri Lankan rupee, there is no significant reduction in cost of petrol and diesel, their statement said.

No change in reconvening date - Mahindananda
President Maithripala Sirisena had under no circumstance agreed to reconvene Parliament on November 7 and Parliament would be reconvened only on November 16, unless the President decides to do it earlier, said UPFA Parliamentarian Mahindananda Aluthgamage addressing a media briefing at the Prime Ministers Office yesterday.
He said a request was made from Temple Trees on Thursday for all UNP members to come to Parliament yesterday at 9 a.m. to hold a meeting with the Speaker and show numbers in order to pressure him to convene Parliament before the 16th using his powers.
They had also notified all their district organizers to light crackers in their areas by 11 am. Accordingly, crackers were lit in every district as instructed.
This was to break the mental spirit of the MPs who were scheduled to take oaths last evening as ministers by fabricating numbers, in an attempt to scare them and prevent them from joining Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Although they have given inflated numbers, according to the count of the Sergeant at Arms, the actual number that attended todays meeting was 107. Of them 14 were from the JVP and TNA. Only 93 of them were from the UNP and UNF. The TNA and the JVP clearly stated that they were supporting the attempt to convene Parliament and most certainly did not state that they were supporting Ranil Wickremesinghe to remain as Prime Minister, he noted.
Aluthgamage said MP Rishad Bathiudeen, Estate sector MPs and Rauff Hakeems party too were there to call for Parliament to be convened at the earliest and at no stage did they pledge their support to Ranil Wickremesinghe. Hence, in reality only 78 of the 93 who were there were actual UNPers. Six of the UNP members had not come for the Parliament meeting. A group of UNP members had gone to the homes of several of the UNP members who crossed over and worshipped them requesting them to come to Parliament yesterday, but they had not done so.
The very next day after Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed as the Prime Minister, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had written to the Attorney General seeking his advice at 10.15 am and by 10.51, the AG had responded and replied he said, adding that it was a clear indication that the AG did not even have to refer legal manuals and that is why he responded immediately as the process was in accordance with the Constitution.
He pointed out that even Ranil Wickremesinghe did not show up at Parliament yesterday as he realizes that he must leave Temple Trees, but a group of parasites were holding him back.
According to Aluthgamage, the UPFA would bring a large gathering to the Parliament roundabout to show the public support they have. By now SLFP/UPFA LG members, PC members and MPs have organized over 5,100 busses to bring the crowds to Colombo. All other parties in our coalition will also join us to bring a massive crowd to Colombo.
Meanwhile, UPFA parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa, hinting that more crossovers were scheduled to take place said despite some of them attending Parliament last morning, they would be standing with the UPFA by evening.
After Mahinda Rajapaksa was sworn in as the Prime Minister, the stock market became active and even the rupee would stabilize. Many positive changes are visible and this Parliament meeting was convened last morning just to try and destabilize that success.
He also warned that Patali Champika Ranawaka would have to answer to charges of misuse of public property for having entered a ministry that he has no authority over. He had made a quick speech and fled the premises. Weerawansa assured that this government under the leadership of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa would forge ahead and no one can stop or obstruct that path.
Expressing his views at the media briefing, UPFA Parliamentarian Dilan Perera said that Ranil Wickremesinghe is always doing the wrong thing. If Wickremesinghe had a problem with the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister, then he should have filed a petition in the Supreme Court, but he did not do that because he too knows that it was not done in an unconstitutional manner. Instead he went whining to foreign diplomats begging for their assistance. If they need to oust the new prime Minister, there are only two methods to do so. One is by bringing a no confidence motion against him and have it passed by a majority after debate. However, even if he manages to oust the new PM, that does not mean he automatically becomes the PM. Again, thereafter it is the President who can appoint another person. Secondly they can defeat the vote of account, but sadly the ones who are most afraid to go for an election is the UNP. As they cannot win either way, they are just holding up this Parliament and majority slogan to satisfy themselves.
He noted that Wickremesinghe and his group are conspiring to topple the new government and this is an unlawful act. This is a major conspiracy against the Government and they may get some international support. However this is wrong and illegal. Hence, we urge the UNP members to at least now realize this mistake and join the right side. In the future Ranil Wickremesinghe would not even hold the Opposition Leaders post.

No support For Ranil - JVP
JVP Propaganda Secretary and Parliamentarian Vijitha Herath yesterday categorically said his party will not support former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament.
Herath, while denying reports which have gone viral on social media that the JVP would support the former Prime Minister said that his party will only support the immediate reconvening of Parliament, ahead of the present date of November 16.
He said that a news website has published a story citing that the JVP has taken a decision to support former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament when it reconvenes on or before November 16.
We have not announced that the party has taken a decision to support Wickremesinghe, though the party voted against the No Confidence Motion brought against former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament some time ago, Herath stressed.
He said that his party is of the view that the present political development is unconstitutional and has to be rectified.
The Parliament should be reconvened as soon as possible to resolve the issue, he added. The Propaganda Secretary added that however his party will stay neutral in Parliament.
The JVP earlier held a rally in Nugegoda urging the President to reconvene Parliament before November 16.

Prorogation constitutional - Minister Nimal
President Maithripala Sirisena prorogued Parliament with the powers vested in him in the Constitution, Civil Aviation and Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
He said President Sirisena has the powers to prorogue Parliament for two months, but Parliament was only prorogued for two weeks.
Minister Silva was addressing the media at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Headquarters, yesterday.
He added that President Sirisena had acted democratically.
The President has acted in terms of the provisions of the Constitution. Therefore, nobody can challenge the decision of the President. He exercised the powers of the Constitution to prorogue Parliament, the Minister said.
If the President has violated the Constitution, any citizen or political party can seek redress by way of fundamental rights petitions in the Courts, he said. The SLFP Central Committee has endorsed the Presidents action to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister and pledged full support with a vote of appreciation been passed unanimously for the action taken by the President.
Besides, it was decided to call a SLFP All Island Executive Committee meeting on November 8 and to convene the National Committee of all representatives before December 31. The President then highlighted the need of maintaining law and order in the country, Minister Silva said.
Everybody should respect law and order in the country and be dedicated to ensuring a peaceful atmosphere, the Minister said.
He said that the SLFP has both Parliamentary power and the peoples power.
As Finance Minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa will forward a Vote on Account before he presents a budget after two months, he said.
He added that the Speaker has accepted Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister of the country.
Once all party representatives met the Speaker, we requested from him that all facilities and privileges accorded to the Prime Minister, be given to Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, as he was duly appointed in terms of the Constitution by the President.
Then the Speaker agreed to provide all the due facilities stating that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa will be accommodated in the Prime Ministers seat, the Minister said. According to Parliamentary norms and regulations, only a No-Confident Motion,brought before Parliament can remove that recognition, he said.
When asked whether they have the support of the required number of Parliamentarians to get a majority, he added that a significant number of Parliamentarians will come forward to extend the support to them in due course.
Ports Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said the Government has decided to ease the burden of the people by reducing the prices of several commodities and fuel prices.
He said that the Prime Minister in his capacity as Finance Minister will forward a Vote on Account to Parliament instead of a budget.A Vote on Account is nothing new in the history of our Parliament they have been preseted in Parliamnent on a number of previous occasions.But, within a budget will be present to the House within three months.
Minister Samarasinghe added that only the President can prorogue Parliament and reconvene it. Before presenting a Vote on Account, the government took measures to reduce the prices of consumer items while cancelling the fuel price formula. People will receive more relief and benefits in future with the presentation of the Vote on Account.
Minister Samarasinghe said the government representatives have briefed the international community, including UN officials about the present political situation in the country. Besides, it has been planned to brief the financial institutions about the present situation.
After briefing the international community, President Sirisena has taken all these political steps in accordance with the Constitution. Accordingly,the appointing of the new Prime Minister and prorogation of Parliament are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. Further, two Gazette notifications will be issued relating to these two steps, he said.
But, if one wants to challenge those measures, there is provision to go to the Supreme Courts on the allegation of fundamental rights violations. Only the Supreme Court can give an interpretation on this. But in accordance with the Constitutional provisions, only the President can ask the Supreme Court for an interpretation, he added.

Prorogation of Parliament: The wider picture
There is a big debate going on about the President Maithripala Sirisenas decision to prorogue the Parliament of Sri Lanka. Apparently foreign parties and missions too are getting involved in the commotion, according to the reports in circulation. It is prudent to examine this in more detail because of the underlying controversy.
Constitutional position:
In the original (1978) Constitution of Sri Lanka, before it was amended last under the 19th Amendment, the governing provision for the prorogation of Parliament read as follows;
70 (1) The President may, from time to time, by proclamation summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament provided that;
Such an action would be subject to the other provisions in the sub-sections of the articles dealing with the dissolution and prorogation.
This section was amended under the 19th Amendment by repealing paragraph (1) quoted above of that article and by substituting the following;
(1) The President may by Proclamation, summon, prorogue and dissolve parliament..
Provided such decision is taken in accordance with the provisions applicable for the dissolution and prorogation of Parliament.
As it stands for the purpose of our discussion the articles applicable for the dissolution are irrelevant. What is relevant and in force in the Constitution with regard to the prorogation are as follows;
Article 70 (3), A proclamation proroguing Parliament shall fix a date for the next session, not being more than two months after the date of the Proclamation: Provided that, at any time while Parliament stands prorogued, the President may by Proclamation-
(i) Summon Parliament for an earlier date, not being less than three days from the date of such proclamation, OR
(ii) Subject to the provisions of this Article, dissolve Parliament.
Article 70(4), all matters which, having been duly brought before Parliament, have not been disposed of at the time of the Prorogation of Parliament, may be proceeded with during the next session.
Accordingly, these are the only articles relevant to the prorogation of Parliament by the President.
Therefore there is no constitutional violation in the proclamation made by the President to prorogue Parliament. As he has acted under the Constitution there is no need for any external influence to urge him to convene the Parliament before the scheduled date.
The dates of the next session may have been fixed by the President taking into consideration the things that have to be done during the period the Parliament stands prorogued.It becomes totally an act of buffoonery to insist and demand an earlier meeting date of the Parliament disregarding the preceding actions and preparation required prior to the date fixed.
The Position of the Parliamentarians
The claim/demand to reconvene Parliament appears to be a move to appease the supporters of the constituent parties in the UNFGG who are tormented by the surprise move of dethroning their leader. Those who advocate and ostensibly hang on to such a ruse are doing so only to help the supporters to overcome their shock. They know very well that there are provisions clearly enshrined in the Constitution empowering the President to prorogue Parliament.
Prorogation of the Parliament is nothing new to Sri Lanka. From 1947 the Parliament has been prorogued about 50 times. After the New Republican Constitution in 1978, 25 sessions of Parliament have been prorogued. Parliament has been reconvened during the period of prorogation in 1958 by Governor General Sir Oliver Goonetilleke to declare a state of emergency. But for reasons best known to them certain foreign countries have expressed their concern about the recent prorogation.
The subject has been raised in the British Parliament and some members in the House of Commons have expressed views about the removal of Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister. They have to be informed that what the country has done is appointing a new Prime Minister due to the ceasing of the office of the Prime Minister under certain provisions of our written Constitution unlike in Britain (which does not have a written Constitution).
Due to the sudden withdrawal of the main constituent party (UPFA) from the National Government, it became necessary for the President to reconstitute the Cabinet in line of the Constitutional provision of limiting it to 30 members from the current numbers exceeding the maximum that could be accommodated under a normal coalition government. Arising out of this situation, exercising his powers under Article 43(3) of the 19th Amendment adopted under the Ranil Wickremesinghe Government, the President has taken steps to change the assignment of subjects, functions and composition of the Cabinet of Ministers.
But according to Article 46(2) The Prime Minister shall continue to hold office only during the period in which the Cabinet of Ministers continues to function. The office of the PM ceases when the Cabinet is reconstituted.
Then according to Article 42(1), the President shall appoint as Prime Minister, the Member of Parliament, who, in the Presidents opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament.
Perhaps those expressing contrary views may be unaware of these legal provisions enshrined in our Constitution. Some of the foreign countries concerned about our issues have their own issues unsettled. Canada is still debating about the pros and cons of Prorogations. The country is still debating about inconsistent precedents regarding earlier prorogations.
Member of Parliament Ajit Perera who is the spokesman of the UNP showed Erskine Mays Volume in a media conference to give the impression that the former British Constitutional theorist Erskine May holds a different view about our situation in his book, Parliamentary Practice. But this is what he has stated;
The prorogation of Parliament is a prerogative act of the Crown.
He has further stated in his 24th edition: The effect of a prorogation is at once to suspend all businesses including committee proceedings until Parliament shall be summoned again, and to end the sittings of Parliament.
Ironically, MP Ajit Pereras references remind us about his exhaustive intervention and attempt to include some irrelevant foot notes into the final COPE report on the Central Bank Bond Scam which everybody knew was aimed to whitewash the sordid episode.
Sri Lankas situation
The Indian situation is slightly different due to specific provisions in the Constitution. In India, the President who has the power to prorogue has to, in exercising this power act on the advice of the Prime Minister. The very fact that such a clause is included [in the Indian Constitution] shows that without such a clear directive there is no necessity for the President to consult anyone before exercising the power to prorogue. This is Sri Lankas situation.
MP Ajit Perera has to be reminded about the history of exercising of Presidential powers in dissolving Parliament suddenly on the day the 1st COPE report on the Bond Scam was to be tabled under the advice of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. No consensus was sought in that exercise but they relied entirely on the Constitutional powers disregarding unhealthy consequences associated with that dissolution.
Constitution of Sri Lanka (before and after all the amendments) clearly provided the powers to the President to remove the Prime Minister. The 1978 Constitution provided for the removal of the Prime Minister by the President issuing a letter to that effect under his hand.
In the amended version (19A) article 48(1) the circumstances under which the Prime Minister ceases to hold office are; By removal from his office; Resignation OR otherwise.
Removal from office is the same power given to the President under the amended Constitution which however was more fully elaborated in the previous Constitution.
It is therefore clear that the removal and appointment of a Prime Minister, a new Cabinet of Ministers and the prorogation of Parliament are acts in conformity with Constitutional provisions.

Range Bandara's bribery claim baseless - Keheliya
Government Co-Spokesman MP Keheliya Rambukwella dismissed claims made by MP Range Bandara during a meeting held at a committee room in Parliament yesterday that he was offered a bribe to support the new government.
Rambukwella dismissed the claim as baseless and utterly false.
Responding to a query by the Daily News during a press briefing at the Prime Ministers Office yesterday, he said if such an attempt had been made to bribe him, he should have first lodged a complaint instead of merely talking about it.
If somebody is announcing that somebody had offered him a bribe, as a citizen its his duty to go and lodge a complaint with the names etc. anybody can make allegations or claims but that becomes authentic if you go and make a complaint and prove your claims. He should have made a complaint with the CID as this is a huge amount of money he is talking about.
Just somebody announcing that he was offered such a huge amount is baseless. Knowing Range Bandara and his capacity, I dont expect such actions from him, Rambukwella said.

Rise in nationalist politics in mid-term polls
Confrontational politics is on the rise, troops are called in to watch the borders and prevent immigrants entering the country. Women are playing a bigger role in the poll campaign, with many more women seeking elections in these polls.
The first mid-term elections in the United States since the election of Donald Trump as President in 2016, will give US voters the first chance to make a public statement on the policies of the Trump Presidency, and also show the trend of politics in the country two years after his election, and two years before the next presidential election.
The issue is, will the Republicans be able to keep control of the two legislative chambers of the Congress  The House of Representatives and the Senate. At present the Trump supporting Republicans control both Houses.
Up for election in these mid-term polls are all 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives, and 34 of the 100 seats in the US Senate.
Poll rise
While mid-term elections in the US usually show very low polling, compared to the presidential polls, these polls show a considerable rise in public interest. This is largely due to the interests of the Democrats, who are strongly opposed to the policies and politics of Donald Trump, and also the rise in womens interest in this campaign.
The womens interest had a rise during the issue of the swearing of Judge Brett Kavanaugh as Judge of the Supreme Court, with the Me-Too movement taking the lead in the opposition to his appointment, after allegations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh, many years earlier. The final appointment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, was a major victory for Donald Trump and the Republicans, and the heated politics at the time saw a marked increase in Republicans, both men and women, being involved in the mid-term polls campaign. This Republican interest has since come down, and the Democrats remain on the rise, with expectations of major gains by Democrats, especially in the House of Representatives.
The campaign is a fight between the Republicans and Democrats, with President Trump playing a very active role to keep his hold over the two Houses of Congress, to proceed with his campaigns against the Obama policies of HealthCare, promote his strongly divisive policies on trade, and proceed with his strongly pro-business policies that have seen success in the past months.
The Democrats seek to take control of the House and Senate to block Trump's ability to implement his programmes. Gaining a majority in the Senate, which is seen as difficult, the Democrats would be able to block Cabinet and Supreme Court appointments. Democrats control of the House can possibly initiate an impeachment on President Trump. But proceeding with such a move will not be possible without a two-thirds majority in the Senate, which is unlikely, unless they win all contested seats in the Senate.
The Caravan
Donald Trump is engaged is highly divisive politics in the campaign for the mid-term elections, with strong attacks on the media, repeatedly naming them as fake news. He is also increasing the nationalist rhetoric, leading to increased opposition to minority communities, and leading to rising communal rivalry in the electorate. After his statement at the UN General Assembly that he moves away from Global trends to patriotism, he has since said he is a nationalist. His current political speeches and trends have led to critics stating that he is promoting White Nationalism, which is increasingly popular with White semi-urban conservative people, who see it as the core of his slogan to Make America Great Again, the key call in his Presidential Election campaign.
He is now warning the American voters of a rising threat from immigrants, with what is described as a caravan of would be migrants moving from Honduras, San Salvador and Nicaragua and moving through Mexico to the United States. The initial number of these caravan migrants who were around 7,000 (including wives and children) have since reduced with Mexico giving asylum to nearly 2,000, and many turning back after Trumps warning of the use of US troops on the southern border with Mexico.
Trump is increasing both fear and hatred towards the migrants, with emphasis on Latin Americans, in the context of the large number of Latin American voters in the southern states of the US, and the increased numbers of Latin Americans being registered to vote in the coming election. The fear of the caravan migrants is increasing with Trump ordering 5,200 US troops to the Mexican border, to add to the Police and other security personnel numbering over 3,000 in the border region. In his anti-immigrant war path Donald Trump now says he will build Tent Cities or makeshift prison camps to hold any migrants who enter, and would be held till any possible legal release.
As his divisive politics gather strength, Trump says he seeks to end the long-accepted constitutional guarantee of birth right citizenship in the US, to children of non-citizens who are born in the US. This blends with his campaign to clamp down on migrants and immigration  on which the US has been built. Very easy with wrong figures, he says the US is the only country in the world that allows birth right citizenship, which is incorrect. There are 30 countries that allow it including Canada, Mexico and many South American countries.
As the mid-term polls, gets heated, there was a major tragedy in the US with 11 Jewish Americans being killed in a gun attack by a White American last Saturday, at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. The suspect killer had shown clear anti-Semitic thinking in social media, and wanted to kill Jews.
Many Jewish leaders of Pittsburgh were opposed to the visit to the site of the killing, while the funerals of the dead were still taking place, by President Trump with wife Melania, daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner  the latter couple being Jewish. There were citizens who protested when the visit took place, and Trump blamed these protests on the media.
The mid-term elections in the US take place on November 6. Early voting has already begun. Both sides Republics and Democrats - are looking forward to higher polling than normal, and analysts believe the swing may be in favour of Democrats, especially for the House of Representatives, and a likely check back to President Trump.

Rupee bounces, investors upbeat
Sri Lankan Rupee yesterday appreciated after recently hitting its all time lows against the US dollar consequent to the appointment of new Prime Minister and Finance and Economic Affairs Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa by the President.
The Rupee has appreciated to Rs 175.82 against the US dollar after it had hit its lowest Rs. 177.32 against the dollar yesterday, the Central Bank said.
Meanwhile, financial analysts said there was heavy purchasing by local investors and selling by foreign institutions on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Yesterdays net foreign outflow for the total stock market was Rs.3 billion, they pointed out.
The reason for this, they said, was that confidence is gradually growing among traders and local and foreign investors towards the new government.
Senior SLFP Parliamentarian S.B.Dissanayake said on the situation that market of buying and selling securities, commodities, options and other investments had been on a downtrend under previous regime because of lack of political and economic stability under the UNP rule.
Investors and foreign firms that flee the market due to rising tensions and uncertain political and economic calculus of former Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, are now bringing their investments and dollars to the country, he said. President Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa are indeed working hard to enable the policy environment for investments, he said, The investors have seen much needed political stability being established under the presence of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Rajapaksa.
One can expect to see the rising of economic indexes as the traders will grow in confidence. President Sirisena and Prime Minister Rajapaksa are addressing the issue of how best to pursue domestic policies to maximise economic growth,he said.

Challenging govt.'s decision to re-impose liquor ban on women:
SC grants leave to proceed with petitions
The Supreme Court yesterday granted leave to proceed with four Fundamental Rights petitions filed by several social activists including popular actress Samanalee Fonseka.
They sought an interim order to suspend the re-imposing of the liquor ban on women by the gazette notification dated January 18, 2018.
The Supreme Court Three-Judge-Bench comprising Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and Justice Vijith Malalgoda fixed the matters for argument for February 6 next year.
Leave to proceed was granted under Article 12(1), 12(2), 14(1) (g) of the Constitution.
The petitioners had also sought to declare that the Ministry of Finance or the State are not entitled in law to revoke the Excise Notification in a manner which prevents females from lawfully being employed at a place of production and sale of liquor.
The petitioners cited Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera, Ministry Secretary Dr. R. H. S Samaratunga and Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioners state that by Excise Notification No.02/2018 dated January 10, 2018, the Minister of Finance has inter alia revised the Excise Notification No. 666 by inter alia repealing paragraphs 5(v) and 11(c) of the said Excise Notification No. 666.
The petitioners said Paragraph 11(c) indicates - Persons to whom liquor is not to be sold or given - No liquor shall be sold or given.. (c) to a woman within the premises of a tavern
The petitioners state that this prohibition was a draconian measure that was arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable and discriminatory to female citizens of the Republic.
The petitioners state they were reliably informed at a media briefing that a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, Mahinda Samarasinghe has declared at a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers ostensibly held on January 16, 2016 that the Cabinet of Ministers has purportedly decided to revoke the recent gazette allowing women to purchase alcohol which the petitioners verily believe refers to the said Excise Notification.
The petitioners state that the above circumstances give rise to a reasonable apprehension regarding an imminent infringement of the petitioners right to equality and equal protection of the law guaranteed to them by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution in as much as-
(a) Any revocation of the said Excise Notification would be unreasonable.
(b) Any such measure would deprive the members of the female gender who have attained the requisite age specified by Law from being lawfully employed at places of production and sale of liquor.
(c) Any such measure would deprive the members of the female gender who has attained the requisite age specified by Law from lawfully purchasing liquor which is a legal product that can only be manufactured, distributed and sold with the express regulation and control of the State.
(d) An imposition of a prohibition applicable to members of only one gender would tantamount to an unequal treatment of the members of such gender.
The petitioners state that the above circumstances give rise to a reasonable apprehension regarding an imminent infringement of the petitioners right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of their sex guaranteed to them by Article 12(2) of the Constitution.
Counsel Viran Corea with Thisya Weragoda, Iresh Seneviratne and Thamali Dinushi Perera appeared for the petitioners.
Additional Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appeared for the Attorney General.

Seats, wheels recovered from Indonesia jet crash site
INDONESIA: Seats, wheels and other parts of a crashed Indonesian Lion Air jet were hauled from the depths Friday, as authorities analysed black box data that may explain why the new plane plummeted into the Java Sea, killing 189 people.
Search teams have been scouring the seabed for the fuselage of the Boeing-737 MAX 8, which plunged into the waters off Indonesias northern coast shortly after takeoff Monday despite only having been in service a few months.
Today we will start diving (again) at the spot where we think the plane crashed, said Isswarto, commander of the Indonesian navys search-and-rescue division.
There is a lot of little debris, plane wheels, and seats -- all totally destroyed and in pieces. Divers were searching an area about 25-35 metres deep, but have been finding fewer body parts than earlier in the week, he added.
Theyre scattered everywhere and some may have been washed away by the current. Dozens of body bags containing remains have been recovered from the crash site so far.
Television images showed divers tying ropes to twisted plane parts scattered along the seafloor.
On Thursday, authorities said they had recovered one of the planes black boxes, which airlines are required to install in jets, as well as parts of its landing gear.
The black box could offer investigators their best chance of discovering why such a new jet crashed. The devices help explain nearly 90 percent of all crashes, according to aviation experts.
The devices record information about the speed, altitude and direction of the plane as well as flight crew conversations.
The single-aisle Boeing plane, en route from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang city, is one of the worlds newest and most advanced commercial passenger jets.
Boeing and US National Transportation Safety Board officials have joined the Indonesian team in sifting through twisted metal plane parts and piles of passengers torn clothing, shoes, wallets and phones.
Passengers remains are being sent to hospital for DNA identification, with the first funeral for one of the passengers held on Thursday.
But many other victims have yet to be found and there are hopes more can be recovered in the bulk of the wreckage, including those who may still be strapped to their seats.
Lion Airs admission that the jet had a technical issue on a previous flight -- as well its abrupt fatal dive -- have raised questions about whether it had mechanical faults such as a speed-and-altitude system malfunction.
The accident has resurrected concerns about Indonesias poor air safety record which until recently saw its carriers facing years-long bans from entering European Union and US airspace.
Indonesia has had nearly 40 fatal aviation accidents in the past 15 years, according to the Aviation Safety Network.
Lion Air, Indonesias biggest budget carrier, has been involved in a number of incidents including a fatal 2004 crash.
In 2014, an AirAsia crash in the Java Sea during stormy weather killed 162 people. The worst disaster in Indonesias aviation history left 234 dead in 1997 when an Airbus A-300B4 operated by national carrier Garuda Indonesia crashed in a smog-shrouded ravine in North Sumatra, just short of the airport.- AFP

SLC resolves Pallekele Test hotel mix-up
The hotel mix-up between Sri Lanka Cricket and Earls Regency Hotel has virtually been resolved with SLC awaiting the final confirmation from the hotel by 9 am today for the release of the rooms to accommodate the Sri Lanka and England cricket teams for the second cricket Test to be played at Pallekele from November 14-18.
SLC CEO Ashley de Silva said yesterday that Aitken Spence had agreed to release the 78 rooms required by SLC.
We looked for an alternate hotel and we were not happy with it but now Aitken Spence is going to release the rooms to us, said De Silva.
We spoke to the tour operators and negotiated with them. Aitken Spence must be moving the people already booked into some other hotel and making their own arrangements. We are in the process of finalising it. We are waiting for the final written confirmation from Aitken Spence today, he said.
SLC were caught up in a situation where the rooms they had booked for the Test match were given out to UK-based tour groups and they had two choices - to find an alternate hotel or to move the Test match from Pallekele to a different location which would have been Colombo.
Thankfully the issue seems to have been resolved without the Test match not having to be moved.

Theft of Rs. 3.2 mn worth case productions:
Statements recorded, case postponed
A Senior Officer of the Judicial Commission visited the Panadura Magistrates Court on Monday to record statements from Police officers who conducted investigations into the theft of production items (jewellery) from the courts record room in 2014.
The Panadura South Police Crime Branch conducted investigations following a complaint made to the police by the then Registrar of Court on the instructions of Magistrate Range Dissanayake in 2014. Panadura South Police said Rs. 3.2 million worth production items kept in the production and record room was stolen allegedly by the record keeper of the courthouse in 2014.
Police arrested the woman and recovered 162 receipts of pawned jewellery kept in her house.
The record keeper had allegedly pawned the stolen jewellery items at pawn shops in Moratuwa. Police recovered the items. It is revealed that productions of over 162 pending cases of robberies were stolen. She was produced before court and remanded in 2014. Subsequently, she was ordered conditional bail by the Panadura Provincial High Court and released.
When the case was called before Panadura Chief Magistrate Chandana Liyanage on Monday, the suspect under interdiction appeared before court on bail. Police Sgt Samanlal Edirisinghe of Panadura South Police Crime Branch informed the Chief Magistrate that the report of the investigations into the theft of production articles had been submitted to the Attorney General for his perusal to take legal action against the suspect. There is no response from the Attorney General.
The Chief Magistrate ordered the police to look into the matter and the case was postponed.

Three Test match specialists who made a great impact in ODI Cricket
Cricket has always been a challenging sport, where the fight between the bowlers and the batsmen is eternal. Batsmen have managed to decipher every mystery ball devised by the bowlers and the bowlers have always found a way to fox the batsmen with new variations.
To master the art of batting or bowling, it takes tons of dedication, hard work and persistence. Moreover, all the 3 formats of cricket demand different approach, skills and mindset to succeed. The batsmen find it very difficult to adapt from the shorter version of the game to the longer ones and vice-versa.
However, there are some immensely talented players who have been specialists in one format but have surprisingly managed to make an impact in the other formats are well.
Here are 3 legendary players, who were thought of as a 'Test specialist' and their success in the shorter version of the game was a surprise.
3. YOUNIS KHAN
Younis Khan came into the limelight when he managed to score a fighting hundred in the second innings of his debut Test match against Sri Lanka at Rawalpindi in 2000, though his phenomenal performance could not save the match for his side.
Younis continued to impress in the longest version of the game, as he amassed 10099 Test runs at a solid average of 52.06. However, his success in One-Day cricket was doubted by many, but Younis proved his potential with the bat in the shorter format as well.
Younis represented Pakistan in 265 One-Day Internationals, scoring 7249 runs at a decent average of 31.25 and an impressive strike-rate of 75.29.
2. MAHELA JAYAWARDENE
Mahela Jayawardene is one of the finest batsmen in the history of international cricket and belongs to the elite club of cricketers to score more than 10,000 runs in both formats of the game.
Jayawardene played numerous memorable knocks for Sri Lanka since his debut in 1997 and was best known for his ability to play the 'sheet anchor' role. Jayawardene's Test match performance was always top notch and the 6 double hundreds he scored in this format is a concrete evidence of this fact.
Jayawardene struggled in the shorter version of the game during his initial years and his fitness for this format was often questioned. However, his perseverance and hard-work yielded him the desired result and he managed to accumulate 12650 runs at an average of 33 in the 448 One-Day internationals he played for Sri Lanka.
1. RAHUL DRAVID
Rahul Dravid became an immediate superstar for India when he scored a crucial 95 in his debut Test match against England at Lords in the year 1996. Rahul, as a Test batsman, improved gradually and mastered the art of batting. He is certainly one of the best 'Test-match' players to have ever played the game. He earned the title of 'The Wall' because of his solidity and he was a nightmare for the bowlers in the longest format of the game.
Rahul, with his splendid stroke-play and rock-solid defensive technique, gathered over 13000 Test runs at an average of 52.31. Dravid was equally adept in the shorter format of the game. His ability to rotate the strike made him a vital asset in the Indian middle order. He played 344 One-Day Internationals for India, giving numerous match-winning performances and scoring 10889 runs at a stunning average of 39.17.

## Title: A timely measure
## Supertitle:

A timely measure
President Maithripala Sirisena, in his address to the Nation this week whilst explaining the events that led to the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister, pointed out one glaring fact about the previous administration - its UNP-inspired economic policies and decisions had completely alienated the common man and trampled on their aspirations.
Former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had a reputation for floating economic theories and visions which had no bearing whatsoever on the fortunes on the common man. He would talk at length about the economic climate in 2040, totally neglecting the socio-economic imperatives of the present. It was obvious that the President watched in frustration as the finance czars of the previous administration, who all belonged to the UNP, heaped tax upon tax on the common man  even on some essential goods.
It was inevitable that at some point the President would have had to intervene and he did, to save the economy and the people from an abysmal fate. In this light, the appointment of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister and Finance Minister was the only available alternative. Prime Minister Rajapaksa, who has a proven track record in taking the peoples side in the economic debate, pointed out the need to provide relief to the people at a discussion with university dons.
Barley hours later, in consultation with and under the guidance of President Sirisena, he announced a series of measures aimed at affording relief to the masses and rejuvenating the moribund economy. These contain both short term and long term measures that will enable the people to heave a sigh of relief and the economy to pick up pace. Given that no other economic factors have changed in the meantime, the announcement also exposed the UNPs duplicity and deception  these are simple steps that they could have been taken for the sake of the people, but they did not.
The most welcoming part of the announcement concerns the reduction of fuel prices. The Rs.10 (per litre) reduction of Octane 92 petrol will benefit three wheeler owners and motorcyclists, who were sent reeling by the so-called fuel price formula of former Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, on the 10th of every month. Likewise, the reduction of diesel by Rs.7 per litre will be a boon for goods and passenger transport operators. The cost of fruits and vegetables should come down as a result. We also expect the private bus owners to display the same keenness they had for upping the fares when the prices went up, to reduce the fares in the wake of the price reduction.
The reduction of Commodity Levies and taxes on several essential goods will also be welcomed wholeheartedly by the people who are burdened with the high Cost of Living (COL). This will have a favourable impact on family budgets, as many Middle Class and poor families struggled to make ends meet in the face of the high COL. However, the Government will maintain the existing levies on some products to safeguard the local farmers whose harvest is just coming to the market. This is in sharp contrast to the UNPs policy of allowing limitless imports of crops that can be grown locally, much to the detriment of local farmers. Farmers received another concession on Thursday night in the form of a pledge to write off agricultural loans obtained during the last three years, apart from a reduction in fertiliser prices.
Another laudable initiative is the reduction of the Telecom levy from 25 percent to 15 percent. A lot of revenue is denied to the local telecom operators as consumers squeezed by the high telecom taxes seek alternatives such as Viber and Whats App to communicate with their loved ones and business contacts abroad, circumventing the traditional IDD system. This step should drive some of that traffic back to the traditional telcos.
Most of the other measures announced have a more long-term outlook and impact but all are centred on giving the local entrepreneur, trader and farmer a more prominent place in the economy. For example, to encourage local entrepreneurs, professionals and migrant workers to remit their earnings in foreign currency on services provided outside Sri Lanka, Income Tax will be exempted on such remittances. The adverse impact created by high indirect taxes will be mitigated by simplification of VAT and NBT. The threshold for the VAT liability of wholesale and retail sector also will be increased from Rs.50 million to Rs.100 million per twelve months providing benefits to small traders and businesses.
The concessionary Income Tax rate of 14% is presently applicable under the SME categories only for Companies. This rate will be extended to include individuals including those providing professional services. VAT on import of fabric will be exempt providing benefits to the small and medium garment manufacturers.
These are timely measures that will no doubt help revive a badly mismanaged, battered and faltering economy. President Sirisena and Prime Minister Rajapaksa are likely to study whether further concessions could be granted to stimulate the economy, now that political stability has been achieved.

Winds of change in Brazil
In yet another sign that the world is increasingly shifting to the Right, far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro won Brazils Presidential Election on Sunday by a landslide. Official results gave Bolsonaro a 56 percent share of the vote in Sunday's runoff, comfortably ahead of Fernando Haddad, the candidate of the centre-left Workers Party (PT), who had 44 percent.
Bolsonaro, a former Army Captain whose campaign motto was Brazil above Everything, God above Everyone pledged to defend the Constitution, democracy and freedom after winning the polarising election, denying accusations he will turn Brazil towards authoritarianism. This is not the promise of a party, nor the word of a man. It is an oath before God, he said in his victory speech. Many analysts say his victory reflects the wishes of a frustrated and dispossessed electorate, besieged by economic woes.
His Brazil First slogan closely mirrors US President Donald Trumps America First policy and his triumph follows victories in Italy and Hungary, among others, for far-right nationalist parties. Italys deputy Prime Minister, Matteo Salvini, and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary have championed action against immigrants and other far-right policies. President Trump, who has already described himself as a nationalist, called Bolsonaro on Monday to offer his congratulations. Incidentally, many critics are calling Bolsonaro Trump of the Tropics.
Miraculous recovery
Bolsonaro made an almost miraculous recovery after suffering a near-fatal stabbing at a campaign rally a few months ago, which may have garnered him some sympathy votes as well. Regardless of the election rhetoric, he faces some tough challenges in reality in this sprawling nation of 210 million people, the worlds biggest centrally-governed (non-federal) democratic country.
His main challenge will be bringing the crime rate down. Throughout the campaign, Bolsonaro promised to crack down on Brazil's violent crime that saw nearly 64,000 homicides last year. In fact, the election campaign itself was one of the most violent in recent memory. He wants to increase gun ownership and has pledged to give police carte blanche to kill criminals and drug lords, in somewhat similar fashion to the Philippines.
Turning the Brazilian economy, South Americas largest, around will be another major challenge. One of Brazils most serious economic challenges is anaemic economic growth, which has been undermining the countrys growth potential. In a country struggling with recession and high unemployment with a rapidly deteriorating quality of life, there is vast inequality. Brazil's six richest men have as much wealth as the poorest 50 percent of the population, which stands around 100 million people, according to Oxfam.
Corruption is still rampant in Brazil, despite measures taken to curb it including the impeachment and arrests of former Presidents suspected of graft. Business leaders, multinational corporations and leading politicians have been caught up in allegations ranging from bribery and money laundering to attempting to distort the democratic process. A Pan-South American Police operation called Lava Jato or Car Wash is still netting some suspects.
Poverty is also rampant in Brazil, where many people spend their entire lives in the infamous favelas or slums in the big cities. They have looked on with disdain after seeing civil servants retire in their 50s with a full pay pension, whereas they do not even have access to basic services. Thus alleviating poverty will remain a major challenge for the new President, who takes oaths on January 1, 2019.
But Bolsonaros biggest challenge will be shedding his authoritarian image and appearing as a President who works for all Brazilians. Many who voted against him have expressed fear that he would revert Brazil to a military style of Governance, as he had often been heard praising the military rule that prevailed from 1964 to 1985, which was one of the most violent periods in Brazilian history. He has also made many disparaging remarks against the LGBT community, women, and ethnic minorities. He was in fact charged earlier this year by Brazil's Attorney General with inciting hatred toward black, gay and indigenous people.
Self-styled nationalist
It remains to be seen whether he will soften or change his stance on these issues and instead strive to bring all Brazilians together regardless of their differences. He will have to keep his word to protect the countrys young constitution, drafted only in 1988. Though a self-styled nationalist, the world will be keenly watching his foreign policy, for no nation can live in isolation in todays world. They may shun the concept of Globalism, but many new world leaders learn before long that good relations with the rest of the world are essential. There is a steep learning curve ahead for Bolsonaro in this respect.
Brazil and Sri Lanka have opened embassies in each others countries and the relationship has generally been excellent regardless of the governments in power in either country. Many affluent Sri Lankans are now touring Brazil thanks to regular flights from a few Asian cities and Sri Lanka Tourism should also tap in to the Brazilian market to get inbound tourists. The vast distance between the two nations will not be a hindrance to enhanced people-to-people contact.

The Office of the Prime Minister (PMO) releasing a statement yesterday stressed that UNP MP Sagala Ratnayaka no longer works for the PMO and that he could not use the official letterhead or pose as the Chief of Staff to the PM in any official capacity.
Media Secretary to the Prime Minister, Rohan Welivita in the statement noted that the UNP MP on 2018.11.01, had issued a statement using the official letterhead of the PMO but given that he no longer holds his previous position, the PMO does not endorse its contents and rejected his statement as misinformation.
Sagala Ratnayaka has no connection to the Office of the Prime Minister or the Prime Minister.
As the Head of State, President Maithripala Sirisena has appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister of the country. Similarly, it is the President who also appointed the new Secretary to the Prime Minister, it noted further.
The use of the PMO letterhead and Ratnayaka posing off as Chief of Staff of the PMO, is an illegal activity and has no validity and we would like to clarify that no officer by the name of Sagala Ratnayaka works in the Office of the Prime Minister, the statement further added.

Cricket must show unity if battle against fixing is to be won
Seems like it was Mark Woods bad luck to draw a short straw last week. The day after al-Jazeera released the second part of their investigation into spot-fixing in cricket Wood was put up to talk to the press. He said the accusations reminded him of the boy who cried wolf. Maybe Wood always used to fall asleep before his parents made it to the end of the book. Right now, five months after the first part of al-Jazeeras expose, we are still waiting to see whether the danger they are shouting about really exists, but Wood, like everyone else in English cricket, will hope this story does not end with everyone looking the other way while the wolf eats up the sheep.
Al-Jazeeras second film was more grounded than the first. Its built around the fact that its source, Aneel Munawar, accurately forecast the score in 25 out of the 26 passages of play in 15 different international matches. Al-Jazeera says independent analysis shows the odds he could have done that by guesswork alone are 9.2m to one. The case is not perfect; the one big problem with it is al-Jazeeras lawyers do not seem to trust it enough to let its journalists release the names of the players involved. But there is enough evidence there now that the story should not be swiftly dismissed.
Which, unfortunately, seems to be what some of the authorities want to do. The England and Wales Cricket Board said al-Jazeeras information was poorly prepared and lacks clarity and corroboration. The tone of its response was all wrong. If the ECB wants to demonstrate how serious it is about tackling spot-fixing there are better ways to do it than shouting down the people who are presenting the evidence.
The ECBs statement seemed to put it on the other side of this problem to the journalists working to expose it. Since then the conversation around the investigation has turned into a slanging match about which side is more credible than the other.
Al-Jazeera did not help by throwing back blows of its own. The ICC, together with certain national cricket boards and their supporters in the media, has reacted to our documentary with dismissals and attacks on the messenger, it said. We are particularly struck by what appears to be a refusal from certain quarters to even accept the possibility that players from Anglo-Saxon countries could have engaged in the activities exposed by our programme. That attitude may have been common once and there may still be lingering hints of it around now. But anyone who holds it is a fool.
At this point the question is not whether people are spot-fixing cricket matches but who is doing it and how often. In the last 10 years bowlers, batsmen, and captains, umpires, coaches, groundstaff and administrators have been caught and banned for fixing, and they have come from England, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South Africa, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Zimbabwe. You should not need any more evidence that this is a universal problem. But, if you do, Cricinfo published some last week. It was the story of a corrupt approach made to the Canadian wicketkeeper Hamza Tariq at the 2011 World Cup.
Tariq explains how a friend of a friend invited him out for drinks. The man was a cricketer, which is how they got to know each other. When they went out a second time the man brought three more friends along. They bought Tariq dinner and drinks, and offered, later in the evening, to fix him up with a woman. It was only later, after an officer from the ICCs Anti-Corruption Unit intervened, that Tariq realised they were grooming him. Tariq was a fringe player from an associate team but last I looked the weaknesses those fixers were trying to identify and exploit  fondness for drink, money, sex  are pretty common in countries where they play Test cricket, too.
That 2011 World Cup, it seems now, fell right in the middle of an era when spot-fixing was rife. Mohammad Amir, Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif, Mervyn Westfield, Lou Vincent, Danish Kaneria: all those cases happened in 2010 and 2011. It was also around that time, al-Jazeera says, that Munawar first became involved in fixing.
It also says the ICC has known about Munawar ever since, which is one reason why it is reluctant to hand over all the information it has but would prefer to give it to Interpol instead. We have become increasingly concerned at the ICCs ability and resolve to police the game.
It is not the only one to say this. Remember, Brendon McCullum criticised the ACUs very casual approach in 2016. The head of the ACU, Alex Marshall, argues the unit is much stronger now and the sport has never invested so many resources in fighting corruption. But then, at the same time Marshall is saying that, the Pakistan Cricket Board has appointed Wasim Akram to its new cricket committee. Akram, you may remember, was one of a number of cricketers investigated by the Qayyum report into fixing in the 1990s. The Qayyum report concluded he cannot be said to be above suspicion. The PCB chairman, Ehsan Mani, was able to justify the appointment by arguing that other players who were named in the Qayyum report were allowed to carry on working in international cricket. And he is right. One of them, Mushtaq Ahmed, was Englands spin-bowling coach for years, even though Qayyum concluded there are sufficient grounds to cast strong doubt on him, too. At this point indignant words do not do much to demonstrate anyones commitment to taking the problem seriously enough.  theguardian

Eileen Ash, world's oldest living Test cricketer, turns 107
Born on October 30, 1911 at Highbury in London, Eileen made her Test debut for England against Australia on June 12 at Northampton and played her last Test match against the New Zealand 12 years later at Auckland on March 26, 1949.
She was a specialist bowler by trade and in 2011 she became the first female Test player to reach 100 years old.
In her 12-year international career either side of World War II, she played seven Tests and took eight wickets with best figures of 3/35.
However, she had more success in the provincial matches compared to internationals. She made 102 not out and took 5/10 against Victoria Country and also played representative cricket for Civil Service Women, Middlesex Women and South Women.
Last year on July 23, she became the eldest living women's cricketer to ring a bell at Lord's before the 2017 Women's World Cup final between India and England. The bell is rung to signify the start of play before a match and it is considered a great honour to be invited to ring it on the morning of a big game.
And the English women's team made it special for her as well by making a sensational comeback in the game and beating India by 9 runs in the match. Anya Shrubsole starred with the ball and picked up 6/46 to script a remarkable win.
The International Cricket Council also released a video which they took from ECB to mark Eileen's 107th birthday, where she can be seen teach England captain Heather Knight yoga.
The pair could be heard talking about the old times and seeing pictures of Ash's matches during the World War. Ash went on to add that she would love to be 25 all over again. To which, Knight replied that she should consider a comeback as England could do with another seam bowler.
The pair also played a game of pool before the video came to an end.
Ash would surely be now watching Knight play as she leads her time out in West Indies for the women's World T20, starting on November 2.

Govt. has no issue regarding majority in Parliament: SLFP Secretary
The newly appointed government has no issue regarding the majority in Parliament and therefore, it certainly would proceed until the end of its tenure, General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa said yesterday.
Under the new government, every future election would be held in due time, where Provincial Council elections would be first in line, he said.
Prof. Piyadasa pointed out that the President had the authority to adjourn Parliament at anytime and also to convene it. As the leader of the State, the incumbent President takes each and every step in accordance with the Constitution and the law of the country, he added.
According to him, some parties with vested interests are misleading the public with rumours but, none of them would be able to stop the journey of the President and Prime Minister towards the development of the country. He also said that the combination of these two leaders, who ensures national security, would not divide the country, but protect the nationality and would not sell public assets, is the highest victory of the people achieved after freedom.
