Breathing better  is the cure for hypertension
Learning how to regulate your breathing could be the cure for hypertension if its caught early enough, a new study claims.
Scientists say the neurons which control your breathing also control your blood pressure and, therefore, breathing deeply can help lower your levels.
Hypertension, or abnormally high blood pressure, has been labeled a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and stroke.
High blood pressure runs rampant in the US, with one in every three adults showing elevated levels.
Because of this, researchers say it is vital that effort is placed into identifying people at risk early before its too late.
Breathing and blood pressure are functionally linked through the sympathetic nervous system, which sends signals to the heart and blood vessels.
Researchers at the University of Melbourne and Macquarie University, in Australia, discovered that when neural activity was interrupted in young adults, they could control blood pressure.
The altered neural activity leads to increased fluctuations in blood pressure with every breath taken.
By interrupting the activity between these two groups of neurons during adolescence, we were able to dramatically reduce development of high blood pressure in adulthood, said lead researcher Professor Andrew Allen of the University of Melbourne.
Professor Allen added that the research paralleled what professional athletes and eastern philosophies have long understood about the link between breathing and heart rate.
Biathletes have to regulate their breathing to slow down their heart rate before rifle shooting, and eastern meditative practices such as yoga and pranayama have always emphasized the interaction between the two, he said.
Lauren Hanna, founder and director of Sonic Yoga in New York, says that learning to slow down breathing awakens the sympathetic nervous system and releases positive hormones throughout the body.
Your blood pressure goes down, it increases cardiovascular capacity, and essentially youre extending your life, she said.
Research has shown that breathing deeply and slowly encourages the body to intake its full oxygen quota.
Our body runs on oxygen, oxygen is its fuel, Hanna explained.
So when we get more oxygen, it gives our body energy, purifies our organs, we think better and function better.
Deep breathing can also send oxygen into the blood vessels which improves blood flow, decreasing peripheral resistance (resistance of the arteries to blood flow) as well as regulating heart rate - both of which reduce blood pressure.
The researchers say, however, that any intervention should be done early while the nervous system is still plastic, which is during adolescence.
In adulthood, the interaction between these neural circuits becomes fixed and any reductions in blood pressure from breathing adjustments appear to be temporary.
They add that this emphasizes the need to identify people at risk of developing high blood pressure early - especially because many dont show any symptoms before a diagnosis.
By understanding what predictors of hypertension are easy to assess, we might be better placed to offer early treatment to pre-hypertensive patients, Professor Allen said.

24th death anniversary today: Dynamics of  Premadasa Presidency
Rapid development during the Premadasa era

 Poverty alleviation  Export growth and employment creation through 200 Gar ment Factory Programme  Conversion of GCEC to BOI - With power to Grant Tax Incen tives, Approval to open Foreign Currency Banking Account, Customs Clearance and One stop Shop to grant all approvals for Investors  Commencement of incentives for Infrastructure Projects  World Trade Centre, Kandalama Hotels, Mobile Phone Opera tors, TV, Radio  Inculcating punctuality and meeting targets  Breaking the bureaucracy and changing attitudes to be positive  Meetings to solve problems of investors and not talk shops  Investors experienced a marked improvement in the business climate with President Premadasa who was a man of action and result oriented.  President Premadasa wanted men who could perform and those with the Can Do approach and did not worry whether they were red, blue or green.
I had the opportunity to serve President Premadasa as the Chairman and Director General of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission and also as the First Chairman of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka from '91 to '93 and prior to that as the Chairman of the People's Bank at a very young age. It will be appropriate for me to write about the economic developments undertaken during this period especially the 200 Garment Factories Programme and the poverty alleviation Janasaviya Programme on the 24th death anniversary of President Premadasa.
The 24th death anniversary of late President R. Premadasa falls on May 1. It is sad that the country lost a dynamic leader who was action and result oriented and had the vision to spread economic development throughout the country by taking the garment factories to the villages and providing jobs to rural youth, which resulted in the upliftment of the economy in the rural sector.
As chairman of the People's Bank during the period of President Jayewardena and continuing during the President Premadasa, I was closely associated in the implementation of pro poor and inclusive programmes such as direct lending to self-employed, small scale and micro projects through the People's Bank and its network of branches spread throughout the country. The new concept of President Premadasa for the banks was to set up Praja Naya Niyamakas (PNN) who were given a loan of Rs 100,000 by the bank on provision of security and to on lend small amounts of loans ranging from Rs 500 to Rs 10,000 per person for micro projects. Further the rates of interest charged by the PNN and the on lending rate was recommended by the bank to enable the people to get loans at a very much reduced rates compared to the money lenders who charged exorbitant rates.
Two of the major programmes launched by President Premadasa in which I was able to make a contribution were the Janasaviya or the poverty alleviation programme when I was chairman of the People's Bank and the 200 garment factories programme as the chairman and director general of the BOI, both of which had a direct impact on the upliftment of the rural economy.
Both these programmes made a significant contribution to the economic emancipation of the rural people which comprised 70% of the population of this country.
Janasaviya programme
President Premadasa was one who had feeling for the common man and reached out to uplift their living conditions in many of the programmes, such as the housing development projects, supply of drinking water and electricity and annual Gam Udawa celebrations which culminated in the many development projects completed in the area. Although giving free handouts were the order of the day, President Premadasa was able to change this concept by pushing economic development to the provinces by inviting the private sector businessmen to set up garment factories in the rural areas. Preference was given to Janasaviya certificate holders in the granting of jobs and this enabled the people to earn a wage rather than depend on free handouts. He was also able to activate the state banking sector to play a lead role in the Janasaviya poverty alleviation programme.
This was one of the thrust projects of the government and was handled by a separate ministry. However, the two state banks - the People's Bank and Bank of Ceylon - were called upon to play a major role in these two schemes. In fact, I remember that when the late President was the Prime Minister, he summoned me as the Chairman of People's Bank and Dr Nimal Sandaratne, the Chairman of the Bank of Ceylon to a meeting at the Sucharitha and wanted us to come up with a proposal to set up agency banks in the AGA divisions to provide small sector loans at the door step of the villager.
This meant that villagers would not have to come to banks and fill lengthy forms but could use the agency banks to obtain their loans without going through the normal lengthy procedure applicable to the grant of loans. These agency banks were named Praja Naya Niyamaka (PNN). The banks were to identify persons to be appointed as agents of PNN who could undertake the task of lending money to the people of the area.
They had to provide security for the money advanced by the banks at normal interest rates and they were to on lend at rates of 2 to 3% per month which rate was very much lower than the rates charged by money lenders which was 5 to 6% per month. The maximum money advanced to the PNN was between Rs. 50,000 to 100,000.
The Janasaviya scheme was implemented by both banks and was accelerated after the late President assumed office after winning the presidential elections. The People's Bank had appointed 4000 PNNs and the Bank of Ceylon a similar number.
The PNN scheme provided the opportunity for the rural masses another channel to obtain small sector loans. The private sector banks like the Sampath Bank also came up with a scheme for such small sector loans in certain selected areas and this was a scheme launched by late N.U. Jayawardena who was then the Chairman of Sampath Bank.
The People's Bank, which was set up mainly for the rural sector, at the inception was able to play a lead role in the setting up over 4,000 PNNs, grant of loans without security, self employment loans to youth, agricultural loans, start up loans, tiny sector loans, athamaru loans, pawning, Janasaviya loans, assisting the cooperatives and the cooperative rural banks.
The competition between the two banks also resulted in the rural sector benefiting and areas hitherto not visited by banks were targeted for the grant of loans. However, the People's Bank was able to overtake the Bank of Ceylon in the grant of loans in rural areas. The policies of the late President Premadasa resulted in change of attitudes of the staff of banks to go to the small man who was earlier neglected and meet their requirements rather than wait for the people to come to the banks and queue up and fill forms.
Today we find that many promises are made by politicians without having a proper implementation plan and later forgotten.
However, President Premadasa made it a point to monitor and evaluate performances of banks, ministries, departments and officials not only by verifying statistics but by sending his staff to visit the sites and give him a report after inspection.
This enabled him to find out the officials of ministries and corporations who worked tirelessly to achieve results as well as those who bluffed their way through and enabled him to have an effective monitoring and control mechanism and also to take early remedial action.
200 garment factory programme
I was Chairman of the People's Bank and one evening I had a call from the then Secretary Finance Paskaralingam who told me that the President wanted me to take over the GCEC now BOI. This was quite a surprise and a challenge for me as I knew that the GCEC was quite different from the People's Bank which had over 350 branches and over 10,000 employees with a good cadre of senior management staff who were the best products turned out by our local universities.
However I had always accepted challenges and entered another new organisation which had a major role in attracting foreign direct investment, increasing exports, creation of jobs and the overall economy of the country.
There were many new changes taking place at the GCEC at this time. Some of the major projects and new regulations to promote investment were as follows.
 Setting up of the Koggala Export processing Zone,
 200 garment factories programme,
 Conversion of GCEC to BOI,
 Grant of incentives for the first time for infrastructure projects were brought in compared to the earlier concept of only export oriented projects,
 Setting up of the One Stop Shop at BOI,
 Cabinet Sub Committee on Investment approvals
 BOI projects became the main export earner for Sri Lanka.
The 200 garment factories programme could be considered as one of the main achievements and contribution made by President Premadasa to uplift the rural economy of Sri Lanka with the help and support of investors in the private sector. Well organised factories were set up in the rural areas and the rural girls became a part of the export economy. For the first time we saw factories shifting out of the Katunayake and Biyagama free trade zones in the Colombo and Gampaha Districts to outside provinces.
The US garment quotas were utilised by President Premadasa as a strategic tool for developing the rural economy and to help alleviate poverty in Sri Lanka and was one of the main effective tools which provided a trickle down approach to benefit the poor man. The garment industry became the largest industrial export from Sri Lanka due to the vision of the late president. Workers who had to leave their villages and come to Colombo and Katunayake and stay in boarding houses with measly savings were now able to travel to work from their homes and have a substantial take home pay.
In fact governments which criticised the 200 garment factories programme when in the opposition, once in power commenced the 50 garment factories programme and other schemes thereafter which enabled to build the garment industry on the strong foundation laid down by President Premadasa. Even recently a new garment factory was opened in the Eastern Province.
The private sector was drawn into the 200 garment factories programme by giving tax incentives, infrastructure such as land, electricity, telephone, water, roadways and other benefits, quotas depending on the area selected to enable them to undertake expansions or new projects without much hassle and free of bureaucracy.
This was the era where the One Stop Shop concept for the approval and implementation of projects was carried out by the BOI. All approvals done under one roof by the BOI.
To undertake this project the late president selected the then Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC) and converted it to the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) in order that it would cover the entire country. This was a swift and significant change made within a few days and the Bill was approved by parliament.
Conversion of GCEC to BOI - The all powerful Government Agency to serve investors under the President
The BOI was used as the vehicle to achieve this massive task of setting up 200 garment factories which indeed was a dream come true due to the dynamic leadership provided by President Premadasa.
Since the BOI was directly under the president we found that we did not have any political interference and could work to achieve targets and goals according to set rules and regulations. In 1977 President J R Jayewardene heralded the Open Economic Policy, the Greater Colombo Economic Commission was set up to attract foreign direct investment, set up Free Trade Zones and promote export oriented projects. The GCEC/BOI was a very powerful organisation coming directly under the President and had the power of giving tax incentives, approval to open a foreign currency banking account and Customs functions for the imports and exports relating to GCEC/BOI companies. The first zone was set up in Katunayake and the second in Biyagama and the current Prime Minister who was MP for Biyagama played a major role in setting up the zone in Biyagama. Both Katunayake and Biyagama could be considered two of the very successful free trade zones in the world. President Premadasa set up the Koggala Free Trade Zone.
The success of the 200 garment factories programme was the grant of tax incentives, textile quotas and luxury vehicles which was carried out under BOI as per the applicable rules and regulations without any political interference. In fact President Premadasa did not tolerate any political interference and we hardly ran into problems with any of the politicians in the provinces where the factories were set up. The staff of the BOI and others who were seconded from various ministries played a major role in making the 200 garment factories programme a success. This indeed showed that given the right direction and authority, the public sector management could play a major role in the economic development of our country.
BOI was a one-stop shop where investors could come to one place for all their requirements. The numerous meetings that we had with investors, government ministries, banks chaired by the late president himself and others chaired by the finance secretary were action oriented to solve problems of investors and not talk shops.
Investors experienced a marked improvement in the business climate with President Premadasa and his Secretary Paskaralingam and other staff who were men of action and always result oriented. The private sector and foreign investors really appreciated such speedy action and was not pushed from pillar to post but were served from one centre. President Premadasa wanted men who could perform and those with the Can Do approach and did not worry whether they were red, blue or green.
I remember the frequent meetings we had at Sucharitha where President Premadasa invited investors who were due to open their factories and solved any problems they had. Always at these meetings the Chairman of CEB, Roadways and Water Board were present as these were three items where investors complained: electricity supply, roadway and water supply.
The weekly meetings with the Cabinet sub committee was another vehicle which sorted out matters especially relating to transfer of land for BOI projects and many Cabinet papers were submitted for approval on the recommendation of the Cabinet sub committee.
The twin objectives of the trickle down benefits of the benefits of grass root level development and alleviation of poverty were achieved directly by the implementation of the 200 garment factory programme.
All factories under the 200 Garment Factory programme had a minimum of 500 employees in each factory in an electorate had a money circulation among the workers per month of Rs. 2.0 to Rs. 5 million. In addition all factories had to give the breakfast to the workers.
The target was 200 factories employing 100,000 youth and putting into the economy Rs. 500 million to Rs. 1 billion per month. The youth in the villages were for the first time producing export quality garments going to the main markets of USA and UK.
Credit should also be given to the USA government, as the late president was able to utilise the garment quotas given to uplift the rural economy and move industrialisation from the city to the village. Increase in quotas was also obtained to sustain the expansion, which took place. Even factories were set up in the north in Vavuniya and in the east in Batticaloa.
The then USA ambassador visited the opening of a garment factory in Puttalam with an OPIC investment delegation and they were highly impressed with what they saw. Thereafter, she also visited many other openings where USA investors had set up.
We also had investors from UK, Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany investing in factories in the rural areas hitherto not even thought of by any industrialist, local or foreign.
In the 200 garment factory programme the late president was present for all the official openings of factories and he gave opening dates to all investors and they had to work round the clock to open their factories on the scheduled dates. The opening of a factory was marked by the construction of a clock tower in all the areas which was undertaken by the investor and opened by the President before the factory opening.
At the initial stages it was slow but once started it was a hive of activity and industrialists were queuing up looking for sites to open factories. In fact the initial idea came from the late Kumar Dewapura who was the Chairman of the Tri Star Group. He was given a land in the Kurunegala district by the then Chief Minister Jayawickrema Perera and currently the Minister of Food to set up a garment factory and President Premadasa visited the factory and developed the concept of the 200 garment factories programme. Kumar Dewapura was instrumental in setting up of the first few factories and giving a lead for others to join in the programme. At the time of his untimely death of President Premadasa, 160 areas had been allocated to construct garment factories and 117 factories, all opened by the late president, six were ready for opening and 37 factories under construction.
Punctuality and meeting targets
Another special feature was that each town or village got a clock tower and this indicated that a garment factory had been opened in the area. Punctuality at the openings may be due to the clock towers that were constructed and on many occasions, President Premadasa was ahead of time to open the clock towers to avoid the rahu time.
There were many teams working to successfully carry out this gigantic task of setting up of the 200 garment factory programme.
Many teams from the BOI, UDA, Housing Ministry, CEB, RDA and Telecom were working and included the identifying of investors, areas and land for investment, granting of quota, incentives, infrastructure such as land, electricity, telephones, water, road way etc., setting of target dates for opening of factories, supervision of building construction and reporting progress, assisting in the recruitment of the workers many of whom were from Janasaviya families, arrangements for the opening of the factory and construction of a clock tower in each area.
In addition, the late president also spoke to investors and we had to meet almost daily in the evening at the Sucharitha to review the progress in the presence of investors who had come to sort our problems.
In all these instances they were sorted out on the spot or if the officers were not there, they were given instructions on the phone to attend to matters immediately.
Examples of some of the common matters were the supply of electricity, construction of roadways, provision of telephones which were attended to immediately with the president giving them the date for opening of the factory.
All these showed the excellent managerial skills, commitment and efficiency in which all departments worked to carry out this gigantic task with the outstanding leadership of President Premadasa.
Investors were able to speed up their import and export facilities by the setting up of the separate BOI customs clearing centre.
This mainly assisted the 200 garment factories set up outside the zones and immensely benefited investors by removing many bottlenecks. Therefore, it was really planning, implementing, monitoring and working round the clock that enabled these results to be achieved.
In 1991 the Apparel and Garment exports were app. US $ 764 M. With the setting up of the 200 garment factory programme the exports which gave a boost to the garment exports increased tremendously and have today exceeded US $ 5.0 billion. One of the main advantages of the industry was that since it was the main export earner for Sri Lanka comprising 40% of total exports all governments assisted in the development of the industry.
Even today new factories are opened in the North and East and one of the few avenues available to create employment. Many who criticised the garment industry as a sunset industry can see for themselves the benefit it has given the country. The highest export earner and highest employer of females and meeting tough environmental and working conditions to meet global standards.
Infrastructure projects  The World Trade Centre
It was during the period of President Premadasa that for the first time incentives were given for infrastructure projects. The World Trade Centre (WTC) was one of the significant investments that took place during this time, the exhibition and convention center in Fort, and many other hospitals, housing, TV, radio, mobile phones and hotel projects.
World Trade Centre
This was the first major infrastructure project undertaken by a Singaporean Investor S P Tao that was commenced and approved under the BOI incentive scheme. This was going to be a 39 storey twin tower costing app US $ 130 M and the biggest project undertaken at that time. The ceremonial construction commenced with the presence of S P Tao, myself as Chairman of BOI, Ajith Jayaratne, Cassim directors of Taos company and with Ven Podi Hamuduruwo chanting seth pirith.

Antonians beat Vidyartha  comfortably 62/28
St. Anthonys College began their Plate campaign with a comfortable 62-28 win over Vidyartha College in their opening encounter played at Nittawela yesterday.
Vidyartha failed to pose much of a threat to the Antonians defence but did manage to play well. The Antonians definitely played some good rugby where they rucked, drove and powered their way to score six goals and four tries which made their total of 62 against four goals by the Vidyarthians.
In the first half both teams surprised everybody with superb rugby and by the end of the first quarter it was Vidyartha who were in the lead. However by the end of the first half the Antonians had regained the lead and led 22-21 with little between the two teams defenses.
After the turn off, the Antonians were fast on their feet and excelled in their passing. Most of their players were outstanding, dishing out an intelligent game. Vidyartha too played well, but had to be satisfied with only a goal in this half. Vidyartha were defending stoutly but if they had used the proper advice, they could have done much better.
On the run of play the Katugastota boys certainly deserved to win they did everything a little better than their opponents. The Vidyartha lads started to lose the match in the forward play, due to some superb rugby coming from the winners.
The set pieces and the line outs were shared and it was in the loose play, that the winners gained plenty of possession.

Art of fiction
A national newsmagazine not very long ago in its weekly cover story depicted Thornton Wilder as an amiable, eccentric itinerant schoolmaster who wrote occasional novels and plays, which won prizes and enjoyed enormous but somewhat unaccountable success. Wilder himself has said, Im almost sixty and look it. Im the kind of man whom timid old ladies stop on the street to ask about the nearest subway station. News vendors in university towns call me professor, and hotel clerks, doctor. Many of those who have viewed him in the classroom, on the speakers rostrum, on shipboard, or at gatherings, have been reminded of Theodore Roosevelt, who was at the top of his form when Wilder was an adolescent, and whom Wilder resembles in his driving energy, his enthusiasms, and his unbounded gregariousness.
It is unlikely that more than a few of his countless friends have seen Wilder in repose. Only then does one realize that he wears a mask. The mask is no figure of speech. It is his eyeglasses. As do most glasses, they partially conceal his eyes. They also distort his eyes so that they appear larger: friendly, benevolent, alive with curiosity and interest. Deliberately or not, he rarely removes his glasses in the presence of others. When he does remove them, unmasks himself, so to speak, the sight of his eyes is a shock. Unobscured, the eyescold light bluereveal an intense severity and an almost forbidding intelligence. They do not call out a cheerful Kinder! Kinder!; rather, they specify: I am listening to what you are saying. Be serious. Be precise.
Seeing Wilder unmasked is a sobering and tonic experience. For his eyes dissipate the atmosphere of indiscriminate amiability and humbug that collects around celebrated and gifted men; the eyes remind you that you are confronted by one of the toughest and most complicated minds in contemporary America. An apartment overlooking the Hudson River in New York City. During the conversations, which took place on the evening of December 14, 1956, and the following afternoon, Mr. Wilder could watch the river lights or the river barges as he meditated his replies.
INTERVIEWER
Sir, do you mind if we begin with a few irrelevant and possibly impertinentquestions, just for a warm-up
THORNTON WILDER
Perfectly all right. Ask whatever comes into your head.
INTERVIEWER
One of our really eminent critics, in writing about you recently, suggested that among the critics you had made no enemies. Is that a healthy situation for a serious writer
WILDER
The important thing is that you make sure that neither the favorable nor the unfavorable critics move into your head and take part in the composition of your next work.
INTERVIEWER
One of your most celebrated colleagues said recently that about all a writer really needs is a place to work, tobacco, some food, and good whiskey. Could you explain to the nondrinkers among us how liquor helps things along
WILDER
Many writers have told me that they have built up mnemonic devices to start them off on each days writing task. Hemingway once told me he sharpened twenty pencils; Willa Cather that she read a passage from the Bible (not from piety, she was quick to add, but to get in touch with fine prose; she also regretted that she had formed this habit, for the prose rhythms of 1611 were not those she was in search of). My springboard has always been long walks. I drink a great deal, but I do not associate it with writing.
INTERVIEWER
Although military service is a proud tradition among contemporary American writers, I wonder if you would care to comment on the circumstance that you volunteered in 1942, despite the fact that you were a veteran of the First World War. That is to say, do you believe that a seasoned and mature artist is justified in abandoning what he is particularly fitted to do for patriotic motives
WILDER
I guess everyone speaks for himself in such things. I felt very strongly about it. I was already a rather old man, was fit only for staff work, but I certainly did it with conviction. I have always felt that both enlistments were valuable for a number of reasons.
One of the dangers of the American artist is that he finds himself almost exclusively thrown in with persons more or less in the arts. He lives among them, eats among them, quarrels with them, marries them. I have long felt that portraits of the nonartist in American literature reflect a pattern, because the artist doesnt really frequent. He portrays the man in the street as he remembers him from childhood, or as he copies him out of other books. So one of the benefits of military service, one of them, is being thrown into daily contact with nonartists, something a young American writer should consciously seekhis acquaintance should include also those who have read only Treasure Island and have forgotten that. Since 1800 many central figures in narratives have been, like their authors, artists or quasi artists. Can you name three heroes in earlier literature who partook of the artistic temperament
INTERVIEWER
Did the young Thornton Wilder resemble George Brush, and in what ways
WILDER
Very much so. I came from a very strict Calvinistic father, was brought up partly among the missionaries of China, and went to that splendid college at Oberlin at a time when the classrooms and student life carried a good deal of the pious didacticism that would now be called narrow Protestantism. And that book [Heavens My Destination] is, as it were, an effort to come to terms with those influences.
The comic spirit is given to us in order that we may analyze, weigh, and clarify things in us that nettle us, or that we are outgrowing, or trying to reshape. That is a very autobiographical book.
INTERVIEWER
Why have you generally avoided contemporary settings in your work
WILDER
I think you would find that the work is a gradual drawing near to the America I know. I began with the purely fantastic twentieth-century Rome (I did not frequent such circles there); then Peru, then Hellenistic Greece. I began, first with Heavens My Destination, to approach the American scene. Already, in the one-act plays, I had become aware of how difficult it is to invest ones contemporary world with the same kind of imaginative life one has extended to those removed in time and place. But I always feel that the progression is there and visible; I can be seen collecting the practice, the experience and courage, to present my own times.
INTERVIEWER
What is your feeling about authenticity For example, you had never been in Peru when you wrote The Bridge of San Luis Rey.
WILDER
The chief answer to that is that the journey of the imagination to a remote place is childs play compared to a journey into another time. Ive been often in New York, but its just as preposterous to write about the New York of 1812 as to write about the Incas.
INTERVIEWER
You have often been cited as a stylist. As a writer who is obviously concerned with tone and exactness of expression, do you find that the writing of fiction is a painful and exhausting process, or do you write easily, quickly, and joyously
WILDER
Once you catch the idea for an extended narrationdrama or noveland if that idea is firmly within you, then the writing brings you perhaps not so much pleasure as a deep absorption. . . . You see, my wastepaper basket is filled with works that went a quarter through and which turned out to be among those things that failed to engross the whole of me. And then, for a while, theres a very agonizing period of time in which I try to explore whether the work Ive rejected cannot be reoriented in such a way as to absorb me. The decision to abandon it is hard.

Asian Grand Prix third leg: Sri Lanka wins 2  golds and a bronze
Sri Lankan athletes won two golds and a bronze medal in the Asian Grand Prix third and final leg concluded at the Chinese Taipei International Sports Complex yesterday.
All three medals came in the 800m event category as Indunil Herath (2:51.34 minutes( in the mens and Gayanthika Abeyratne (2:03.87 minutes) in the womens clinched the two golds while Nimali Liyanarachchi (2:06.30 minutes) took the bronze in the womens race.
Overall in all three legs, Lankan athletes won three golds, two silvers and three bronze medals. Athletes Indunil Herath (two golds), Gayanthika Abeyratne (gold and a bronze), Himasha Eshan (two silvers) and Nimali Liyanarachchi (two bronze medals) are the Lankan medalists at the three-legged Asian Grand Prix 2017.
Lankan athlete Waruna Lakshan had to return home without participating in the javelin throw event of the final leg after the Chinese air line demanded Yuan 1300 (SLR 28,600) to board his Nemith javelin on the plane. While Lakshan was inquiring into the matter with the airport officials, why they requested for payment after allowing him to bring the javelin from Sri Lanka to China free, the flight took off, leaving him at the airport. As there was no other flight to Chinese Taipei, he had no option, but to fly to Chengdu, the nearest airport where he can get a flight to Sri Lanka.

Sports Ministry consultant and an observing officer of the event, Sunil Jayaweera communicated with Athletic Association president Sugath Tillakartne and tried to solve the problem. He said that there is nothing wrong from the Sports Ministrys side.
The Sports Ministry has granted money for the tickets. It was Athletic Association who made arrangements with the air lines and they should have informed the air line and make prior clearance. Some are trying to blame it on the Sports Ministry which is wrong, he explained.

Beat Bradycardia!
This week Consultant Clinical and Interventional Cardiologist Dr.Mohan Jayatilake (MD, MRCP) speaks about Bradycardia (slow heart rate than normal), one of the common heart problems among people, especially the elderly.
Q - What is Bradycardia 
A - When the heart beats very slowly it is called Bradycardia. A Heart rate of 60 to 100 a minute while at rest is considered normal in most people. If your heart beats less than 60 per minute it is considered slower than normal.
Permanent pace maker implantation
* In young people and athletes who are fit and healthy, the heart rate less than 60 beats per minute is a normal variation.
* In other people Bradycardia is a sign of problem with the electrical system of the heart.
* Heart rate may fall below 60 during sleep at times in most of the normal people.
Q - What are the symptoms of Bradycardia 
1. Fatigue or feeling tired.
2. Dizziness or light headedness.
3. Confusion with reduced mental capacity.
4. Fainting or near-fainting spells
5. Shortness of breath
6. Excessive tiredness during normal activity.
7. In extreme cases cardiac arrest may occur
Q - Who are most affected How and when 
A - Heart has natural electrical conduction pathways formed by nerve fibers. When the nerve conduction travels through this pathway heart beats occur. The electrical pathway has to go through Sino Atrial (SA) node and Atrio Ventricular (AV) node within heart muscles. These are called hearts natural pacemakers.
Q - How is Bradycardia diagnosed
A  Review your symptoms, medical and family history with complete examination by your doctor. Some people can check their own pulse over the wrist and count it per minute for the heart rate.
a. ECG test  primary test for evaluating Bradycardia. ECG determines the kind of Bradycardia
b. Holtermonitor - a portable ECG device worn on a belt or shoulder strap. It can record the hearts activity over 24 hour period. Intermittent Bradycardia can be detected after evaluation of the report.
c. Event Recorder - Portable ECG device monitors heart activity over a few weeks to few months. This permits the doctor to determine the patients heart rhythm at the time of the symptoms.
d. Tilt table test - This test helps to understand how Bradycardia contributes to your fainting spells. The patient lies down flat on a special table and then the table is tilted as if you were standing up. If change of position causes fainting spells, that will help to establish a link between heart rate and fainting episode. Then some form of Bradycardia due to faintishness can be ruled out.
e. Exercise test - Heart rate increase in response to physical activity during treadmill test in patient with normal variation of Bradycardia.
f. Lab tests - To find out contributing factors such as infection, hypothyroidism or an electrolyte imbalance.
g. Sometimes sleep apnea too can cause Bradycardia. You may undergo test to monitor your sleep.
Normal ECG
Q - What treatment options are available for Bradycardia 
A  The availability of treatment depends on what causes it.
1. If damage to the electrical system causes severe Bradycardia, a device called pacemaker is inserted. It is placed under the skin with a wire going in to the heart. This artificial pacemaker gives electrical impulses to the heart to contract. People older than 60 are more likely to have this type of Bradycardia that requires a pace maker.
2. Treat hypothyroidism with thyroxin tablets.
3. Treat and electrolyte imbalance with electrolytes sodium or potassium. (Na or K)
4. If a drug is causing Bradycardia your doctor may either adjust the dose or prescribe a different medicine.
The goal of treatment is to raise the heart rate so your body gets the blood it needs. If severe Bradycardia is not treated, it can lead to fainting as well as fits or even death.
Q - How can we prevent it or at least the complications 
A  Identify this problem with Bradycardia with symptoms and perform ECG and Holter Monitor test.
1. Elderly people even though they are not having symptoms, regular checkups should be done.
2. Any other person with frequent falls causing injuries to the body and seizures (Fits) as well as cardiac arrest should be prevented by identifying and treating Bradycardia.
Emergency medical treatment to increase heart rate followed by permanent pace maker implantation is necessary.
Some permanent pacemakers which are called I.C.D ( Implantable Cardiovertable Defibrillator ) can deliver a shock to a person who gets irregular rapid heart rates or cardiac arrest due to Bradycardia.
Holter monitor with ECG reading
Q - What lifestyle changes are recommended to keep ones heart healthy
A - Bradycardia is often the result of another heart condition. Follow the below steps to lead a heart- healthy lifestyle .
1. Heart healthy diet  lot of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish and non fat dairy products.
2. Regular exercises
3. Loosing weight
4. Stop smoking
5. Managing high blood pressure, diabetics or high cholesterol

Citizens Mail
It is surprising to find that the World Workers Day celebrated yearly has not brought a new lease of life to the toiling workers in Sri Lanka. In the plantation sector, the tea estate workers have not got an increase of wages in keeping with rising cost of living. Unless they are satisfied they cannot enjoy the May Day.
Similarly, there are underpaid workers in large number all over the island. All of them have to be paid higher wages without further delay by the socialist government.
There are underpaid workers in private sector too. The government should instruct the private sector to increase the workers salaries in keeping with the condition of service in the public sector. In the case of retired workers too, the government must consider a considerable increase of pension to live comfortably in the last stage of their life.
In reality, a part of money is lavishly spent on May Day celebrations. This could have been well utilized for payment of increased salary to the suffering workers.

Clarion  call for  workers  unity
Piyasoma undoubtedly would have left the living world by now, but I shall always recall him about this time of the year: the crotchety, silent mechanic in overalls with his side pockets stuffed with all types of tools. Old Piyasoma was a wizard with the automotive repairs and the workers liked him although they scarcely understood his strange quips which, I suspected, they regarded as the signs of approaching senility.
May Day is the workers New Year Day, he said. Anyone who works for a living starts his year on May Day.
Piyasoma kept on talking about his concept of May Day. Today, forty May Days later, I have come to believe he wasnt far from right. He had said, with a sweep of his arm that nobody at his workplace understood what May Day meant, but that the time would come when they, like him, would regard it as the years beginning.
May Day, he said, means freedom; all over the world it comes in the springtime and, in Sri Lanka, it comes just couple of weeks after Aluth Auvrudda, when workers think of a better life.
Today I pay homage to Piyasoma, one of the obscure, unsung millions of Sri Lankan workers; he crops up in my mind every time May Day rolls around. I thought of him those many May Days when I saw our labouring men and women parading through the streets.
Reform
May Day, or International Workers Day, is traditionally a celebration of the international labour movement and left-wing movements. It is a day which traditionally was reserved to help promote worker rights and recognise the practice of labour laws.
However, in Sri Lanka May Day rallies have shifted from the arena of workers rights to an opportunity for the political parties to promote their political agenda.
Going back the history, we find that it was in 1922 under the leadership of A.E. Goonasinghe that Ceylon founded its first ever trade union, the Ceylon Labour Union. And, five years later, same trade union celebrated Sri Lankas first May Day. Maybe, that is why A.E. Goonasinghe was often referred to as the Father of the Labour Movement.
Subsequently, other trade unions joined the bandwagon and May Day rallies were held at a number of places in Colombo and outstation. It was in 1936, Sri Lankas first political party, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) held its first May Day rally presided over by Colvin R. de Silva.
Turbulent times
This year the workers across the world will commemorate May Day in one of the most turbulent and traumatic periods in history. The world is ravaged by wars, terrorism, bloodshed, economic catastrophe and unprecedented poverty, misery, disease and destitution. The vast majority of the human race has been plunged into the abyss of deprivation, hunger and agonising suffering.
After the failure of the Keynesian model in the 1980s, free market enterprise or the trickle down economy has led to the biggest financial crash in the history of capitalism. And the exploitation and drudgery of the working classes has worsened. The gains of the workers through immense struggles of the last thirteen decades are being drastically slashed even in the advanced capitalist countries.
Statistics
According to The New York Times, the richest one percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. Office for National Statistics (UK) reveal that Britains richest 1% have accumulated as much wealth as the poorest 55% of the population put together. Australia has always lauded its working-class culture, and the subsequent rise of the middle class. But, today, the very nature of society is changing dramatically: the wealth of the highest 20% households on average is 71 times that of the lowest 20% households.
Sri Lanka is no exception. 38 percent of our national income is shared by the richest 10 percent of the population while 1.5 percent of the national income is shared by the poorest 10 percent of the population. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, current Governor of the Central Bank, said that Sri Lanka has been extremely successful in terms of social development according to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals but has not been able to achieve the appropriate balance between social development and wealth creation/employment generation.
The same story is repeated throughout the democratic world. India has 20 per cent of worlds population yet hosts about 40 per cent of worlds poverty and yet now there are more billionaires in India than in Japan.
These figures tell us in simple terms that the aspirations of the May Day pioneers, including the people who sacrificed their lives, have not yet fully materialised.
In his book, Reformism and revolution, the renowned theoretician, Alan Woods gives a graphic description of this disaster. He writes, The crisis of the capitalist system is reflected in a crisis of materialistic values, morality, religion, politics and philosophy. The mood of pessimism that afflicts the bourgeoisie and its ideologues in this period is manifested in the emptiness of its spiritual values.
Memory
In the context of these stirrings of the working class, May Day 2017 attains an extraordinary significance.
Spirit of May Day has been clearly reflected in the Sri Lankan Constitution which has provided for Sri Lankas commitment to a welfare state. Few articles which find mention in the section called Fundamental Rights too provide protection to the working class.
Sri Lanka is currently estimated to have a total workforce of about 8.3 million of which 63.3 percent are males and 36.7 percent are females. This is expected to grow by 12 per cent every year over the next 10 years. Therefore, the Government should realize the significance of the increasing size of the work-force and emphasis has to be given on a planned investment in skill development of the workers in the country.
The Government also needs to put in place a coordinated action for skill development. For this purpose, this writer suggests that the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training should set up a National Council for Skill Development to synergise public and private streams for skill development and also a National Skill Development Corporation set up as well to promote private sector led action.
Fight or flight
Workers are the backbone of our countrys economy. A nation like ours cannot genuinely progress and prosper making its working force unhappy. A lot remain to be done to ameliorate the conditions of the workers, particularly, in the unorganised sectors of our country.
Much of controversy has arisen around injustice done to the poor who are engaged on temporary or contract basis. Apart from their anxiety about their future engagement, they are subjected to several kinds of exploitation. At the same time, the workers in the unorganised sectors are forced to work longer with less wage and corrective measures in this regard are yet to be formulated.
Workers are also partly to blame for their ordeals and miseries. Workers  in both organised and unorganised sectors  are yet to develop class consciousness. Being guided by false consciousness, they are divided into several groups and sub-groups resulting in lack of unity and cohesiveness among them. Political affiliation is the most serious obstacle to the joint fight of workers for their common maladies. Political parties drag them in different directions to promote their partisan interests at the cost of the genuine interests of the workers.
Workers everywhere want decent work and decent pay so that they could be contented and in control of their lives. If they are denied these rights, they will ultimately stand up for what they want.
Sri Lanka is a socialist country which means, among other things, that it should be employee friendly. There are approximately 30 Acts of Parliament which are applicable to employees regulating everything from work hours to the cubic space a worker is entitled to. Unfortunately, majority of employees are totally unaware of their rights. Even senior executives have rights given to them by law with regard to their employment.
But they are not going to get recognition and justice by sitting divided and silent. They need to continue their struggle relentlessly on a platform of unity and solidarity.
Karl Marx gave a clarion call to the workers of the world to unite. He said they had nothing to lose but their chains. What he said 132 years ago is valid even today.

Diabetes, weight  can combine to alter brain
Its well-known that type 2 diabetes can cause medical complications in certain organs, including the brain. But overweight and obese people with early-stage type 2 diabetes have more severe abnormalities in brain structure and cognition than normal-weight people with type 2 diabetes, according to a new study in Diabetologia, the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes.
Having type 2 diabetes and being overweight, then, can combine to have a greater effect on brain structures.
Theres a general agreement that type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for various types of both structural and functional abnormalities in the brain, said Dr. Donald C. Simonson, a co-author of the study and an endocrinologist specializing in diabetes. Simple obesity also shows the same type of abnormalities ... in a milder stage. You can see where its not quite exactly normal but not quite as bad as someone with diabetes.
So, if you have both, will it be worse than if you have them alone Thats what we looked at in this particular study, said Simonson, who teaches at Harvards T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Dr. In Kyoon Lyoo, lead author and a professor at the Ewha Brain Institute at Ewha Womens University in Seoul, South Korea, wrote in an email, As obesity has been known to be associated with metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, and brain changes independently of diabetes, we expected that brain alterations might be more pronounced in overweight/obese participants with type 2 diabetes.
Effects on the brain
Lyoo, Simonson and their colleagues designed a study around 50 overweight or obese people age 30 to 60 who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
Fifty normal-weight people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and 50 normal-weight people without diabetes also participated. These additional participants were age and sex matched to the original group. Those diagnosed with diabetes were also matched for disease duration. Standard body mass index ranges defined overweight (having a BMI of 25 to 29.9), obese (greater than 30) and normal weight (18.5 to 25). -cnn

Drawn from history  NICOLA STREETEN
Art Spiegelmans graphic novel Maus tells the story of the authors parents, Vladek and Anja Spiegelman, from their first meeting in pre-war Poland to their survival of the death camps at Auschwitz and Dachau. It is largely responsible for transforming the way we think about comics. Published in two volumes in 1986 and 1992, having initially been serialized in the magazine Raw, it was the first graphic novel to win the Pulitzer Prize; it also became a publishing phenomenon, selling over two million copies worldwide. A defining feature is its portrayal of the characters as animals: the Jews are mice, the Germans cats, the Poles pigs and the Americans dogs. Of course, Spiegelman was not the first person to use visual anthropomorphization to critique society, and in particular to draw attention to its malevolent elements. By the eighteenth century there was already a rich tradition in Britain and Europe of using animals in satirical cartooning and caricature as a means of ridiculing power and the powerful, and pointing out moral ills through humour while avoiding libel. James Gillray (17561815) often used animals to create venomous representations of politicians, such as the depiction of Charles James Fox as a human figure with a foxs head and brush. In literature animals have a long history of use as a device for social comment, from Aesops Fables to Gullivers Travels (1726).
The historical associations of combining cartoon animals with humour contributed to the difficulty Spiegelman faced in convincing a publisher to produce Maus as a book. In Metamaus (2011), which looked back at the making of Maus, Spiegelman recalled rejections from publishers including Penguin, Henry Holt and Knopf. The authors approach was apparently viewed as trivializing  a risk publishers were hesitant to take. Penguins Gerald Howard explained his rebuff as to do with the natural nervousness one has in publishing something so very new and possibly (to some people) off-putting.
Spiegelmans masterstroke, however, was to use this tragicomic combination to intensify his works central message, while satisfying a readerly demand for both levity and gravity. This was reinforced by his artistic approach, which expresses seriousness through simplicity: his decision to sacrifice colour in favour of a simple black-and-white style, for example, highlighted the darkness of the subject, thereby allowing him to avoid gratuitous representations of death and suffering.
The emotions in Maus are generally communicated through facial expression, often captured with minimal line work, while Spiegelman added personalization through the hand-drawn quality of his lines in both text and images.

Girl who went missing while bathing: Body parts found inside crocodile
Body parts of the girl who went missing while bathing in the Mulannatuwa Wewa in Galnewa were found inside the body of the crocodile, believed to have swallowed her, when residents killed the amphibious reptile and dissected its body on April 29 afternoon.
Gimhani Anushka 
S. M. Gimhani Anushika, 13, of no 246, Lolugaswewa, Galnewa, a Grade 7 student of Galnewa Madya Vidyalaya, became a prey of a crocodile while she was bathing in the Mulannatuwa Wewa with her parents and several children in the neighbourhood on April 27 night.
Her mother had said that she went missing while bathing in the Wewa and that she saw bubbles erupting from the water, and her pair of slippers floating afterward.
A two-day joint search conducted by the Navy, Police life-saving unit and civil defence personnel drew a blank.
A group of residents who continued the search had seen a crocodile resting on the sluice of the Wewa and killed it on April 28 night by hitting it with clubs. Thereafter, they had dissected the reptiles body and found human body parts inside its stomach.
Galnewa Police, summoned to the scene, put up a security cordon at the spot with curious crowds thronging to have a glimpse of the reptile.
An inquirer into sudden deaths and a JMO summoned to the scene could not conduct the inquest due to the presence of a large crowd. The carcass of the crocodile was removed to the Galnewa Hospital morgue where the postmortem was held.
Human body parts found inside the crocodiles body included a part of a skull, an upper pallet with teeth, a hand and leg, and several other body parts which Gimhani Anushika's parents identified as those of their daughter.
Gimhani's mother R. M. Nilanthi Ratnayake, who is nine months pregnant, fell unconscious opposite the hospital morgue on seeing her daughters body parts. She was soon admitted to hospital for treatment. The body parts were referred to the Anurdhapura JMO for a DNA test to further establish that they belonged to Gimhani. A postmortem examination was also due to be held on the crocodiles body.

Good-governance government will realise Premadasas vision: Prime Minister
The good-governance government will be able to realize national reconciliation and Sri Lankan identity, which were the former President R. Premadasas hope for Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today, at a ceremony to mark the 24th commemoration of former president, R. Premadasa.
At the ceremony held before the R. Premadasa statue in Hultsdorf, Colombo, the Prime Minister referred to a speech made by the former president Premadasa, in which he said If I was able to become the President of Sri Lanka, anybody can.
He pointed out that former President Premadasa meant no Sri Lankan should be discriminated due to their ethnicity or other differences.
The former President Premadasa was born out of the people. He dedicated himself for the people and he demised among people. His death is marked by the May Day which represents people, PM Wickremesinghe further said.
Premier Wickremesinghe also said the international community had Sri Lanka marginalized due to the spread of racism, religious conflicts and political hatred within the country, in the few years after the end of war. 
He pointed out the previous regime developed an antagonistic stance against the international arena instead of working with them. It was in a backdrop as such, the joint government headed by President Maithripala Sirisena came into being, the Premier pointed out.
The international community has given Sri Lanka two years to deliver a national solution to the ethnic issue and boost national reconciliation process in the country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Premier Wickremesinghe said an interim report by the Constitutional Council is in the making regarding a national solution and that extensive discussions are being held regarding the matter with all religious leaders and the civil society.
The Primier also said rounds of discussions are being held regarding devolution of power while ensuring the integrity and the sovereignty of Sri Lanka. He also said human rights, election system and freedom of religious practices are topics that have been discussed in length as well.

Gotukola has been part of Sri Lankan cuisine throughout its history and is a part of the food tradition. It is one of the most popular vegetables when it comes to Sri Lankan food.
It has Ayurvedic properties and is immensely valuable in that respect. When it comes to nutrition it is a vegetable that is indispensable when it comes to our health, stated Jayathilake
When it comes to leafy vegetables Gotukola has the highest iron concentration. Iron is an important protein that is essential to the human body and Gotukola can deliver this protein. That is why it is highly recommended that we grow Gotukola in our garden, pointed out Jayathilake
Gotukola grows in two ways  Bush and Creepers.
A bush contains 100  150 plants. Once one plant is planted it creates a whole bunch of plants creating a bush. Then there is the creeper variety. This variety grows like a creeper on the ground parallel to the ground. It is not vertical. It is horizontal. There are nodes in these creepers and from those nodes plants and roots appear, explained Jayathilake
Jayathilake pointed out that some Gotukola plants have large leaves. These can be seen in Creeper plants, producing a good harvest. There are also Gotukola plants with medium sized leaves. They are called Meerigama. This is because they are commonly seen in Meerigama.
Meerigama is also seen in Creeper varieties. It can be exported and the taste is very good. The quality is very good. There is also another Gotukola plant with small leaves. This is Wel- Gotukola. This too grows as a creeper, said Jayathilake.
Jayathilake stated that Wel-Gotukola is normally grown in low lands. But there should be a good drainage system. It can be grown in Coconut and Banana plantations as an intercrop. This is done to make maximum use of the soil. So while awaiting the harvest of Bananas if you grow Gotukola in the spaces in-between you can get an added income.
It is important to select plant material that are not affected by Nematodes that cause the plant to become deformed, stunting the growth and causing the leaves to become yellow. They attack the roots causing the roots to swell up, warned Jayathilake.
CLIMATIC CONDITIONS
FOR GOTUKOLA
 Most suitable to the wet zone.
 Rainfall should be spread out over the land
 PH should be 6.0  7.0
 The soil should have a good drainage system
 Before planting organic manure (cow dung, poultry manure, compost) must be added to the soil and water must be administered by the hose after planting to prevent plants drying up.
 If the heat is too much coconut leaves can be used over the plants
When growing bush plants the distance between two plants should be 20cm. When growing creepers it should be 15cm. After planting the plants grow naturally. In 100 square meters you can grow 9000  10,000 creeper plants. In 100 square meters you can grow 5000  7500 bush plants, informed Jayathilake

Government to pass equal  benefits to all communities: Finance Minister
Government intends to pass on equal benefits of sustainable development to all communities, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister was delivering the keynote address of the 4th High Level Dialogue of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (ESCAP) in Bangkok, Thailand on April 28.
Asia Pacific nations recognise Sri Lankan governments policy on sustainable development. Sri Lanka has embarked on a new journey towards sustainable development thereby intending to pass on its benefits equally to every citizen in the country, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister said the population in the region is ageing faster than the growth of development and therefore, necessary infrastructure should be in place to meet the demand.
Minister Karunanayake was also inducted as the chairman of conference. It is significant that participating countries to recognise Sri Lanka for its initiatives taken to restore financial discipline and transparency.
Asia and the Pacific is the most disaster-prone region in the world. Between 1970 and 2014, the region has been affected by more than 5,223 natural disasters according to ESCAP Statistics, and that was 43 percent of the globally reported disasters. More than 6 billion people in the region were affected by natural disasters accounting for 89 percent of the global total.
Natural disasters cause loss of lives as well as massive financial losses. Asia and the Pacific alone reported economic losses amounting to almost US dollars 1.22 trillion for this, or 44 percent of the global total. During the past 10 years alone, climate related disasters in Asia and the Pacific caused damages of US Dollars 367 billion, resulted in the death of nearly 300,000 people, and a total of 1.37 billion people were affected, the minister said.
Sri Lanka is going through a remarkable transition today powered by a well-crafted medium-term macroeconomic policy framework. Sri Lanka now has a peaceful environment to do business after ending three-decade long separatist movement. But as the new government took office in January 2015, Sri Lanka had to tackle an array of challenges from many fronts, the minister said.
Our policy is focused towards developing the country containing broad policies of national importance that will assist the achievement of the far reaching reforms. My theme for the National Budget 2017 was Accelerated growth with social inclusion, which placed great emphasis on the alleviation of poverty in all manifestations beginning 2017. Social inclusion is a matter of prime concern and the participation of the entire population in the journey for development is a noble objective being a society for all. Such efforts will lay tremendous emphasis on social inclusion and sustainability in economic development, a commitment to achieve the United Nations proclaimed UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 ensuring shelter, safe drinking water and improved living standards for all, the minister said.
I wish to note that while the government is strongly committed to ensuring growth with social inclusion, the fiscal space remains constrained with historically low revenues of around 10-12 percent of GDP. Thus in the last two years in particular, significant emphasis has been placed on increasing revenue to augment the revenue to GDP ratio to at least 15-17 percent in the medium term. As such, measures have been taken to broaden the tax base through elimination of exemptions. We will also be introducing a new Inland Revenue Act, which has a simplified tax code and it is expected to facilitate better administration and compliance. At the same time, the introduction of Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) which connects the three revenue institutions with 27 other entities is also expected to generate better efficiencies in revenue collection.
The Department of Customs and Excise also has seen structural improvements been introduced, he said. Deputy Treasury Secretaries S.R. Attygalle, Chandra Ekanayake and Sri Lankan Ambassador to Thailand Kshenuka Senevirathna was present.
Representatives from economic and financial sectors of countries from Asia and the Pacific region are participating in the conference.

Govt to pay  Rs. 1,000 b in  debt for two years
The government is to pay a Rs. 1,000 billion debt in the coming two years, which was acquired by the previous Rajapaksa regime.
This was revealed at the Presidential Commission Inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue, yesterday. The amount does not include foreign debts due in these years.
It was also revealed that Rs. 600 billion worth bonds are maturing by 2018, and Rs.400 billion worth bonds are expected to mature by 2019. These short term bonds have been issued in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Out of these bonds, there are three medium term bonds issued in 2003 which are to mature in 2018 as well.
For Sri Lankas economy, the coming two years would be like a new moon day, it was observed at the Commission.
These revelations came when Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva was leading evidence at the Commission yesterday. De Silva was questioning former Deputy Governor Dr. W.A. Wijewardena on the reckless manner in which Treasury Bonds have been issued by the Public Debt Department.
Dr. Wijewardena agreed when de Silva suggested that there has been no management of debt on the part of the Public Debt Department when issuing short term bonds of large volumes, without thinking as to how they would pay back when matured.
Dr. Wijewardena agreed when suggested that the total national debt amounted to US $ 11 trillion. He said, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had publicly disclosed this information previously as well.
Representing former Governor Arjun Mahendran, Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva produced documents containing details of the maturity profile of Sri Lankan Rupee bonds as of April 2017.
Dr. Wijewardena answered in the affirmative when asked if the CBSL and the former Finance Minister had close communication regarding the debt management particulars.
De Silva also pointed out that under the previous regime, the Director of Treasury Operations Department had stopped coming to board meetings, to which Dr. Wijewardena said the action was extremely undesirable.
De Silva asked Dr. Wijewardena if he believed that all the above mentioned Treasury Bonds have been issued before the Domestic Debt Management Committee (DDMC) had met and discussed the government requirement and other market conditions, to which the latter said it seemed to be the case.
Dr. Wijewardena also expressed his assent when de Silva suggested that the DDMC and the PDD have failed to execute their responsibilities in managing public debt.
Had not the DDMC met before the issuing of Treasury Bonds in past years, the single handed decision of issuance, interest rate and coupon rate must have been decided by an individual officer in the Public Debt Department, de Silva suggested.
We might have to get a clarification in this regard. I am not in a position to agree or disagree regarding the suggestion. Dr. Wijewardena said to the Commission.
Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva drew the attention of the Commission that it was in a backdrop where Public Debt Department had not executed its responsibilities, that his client Arjun Mahendran took office as the Governor of the Central Bank in January 2015.

Internets latest fashionista
Ernestine "Ernie" Stollberg might be aged 95 but she is taking the world of fashion by storm.
The gran has been gaining recognition in some very stylish circles ever since she was first seen in promotional shots for a concept store in Austrian capital Vienna.
And the chic gran has now even appeared in the fashion bible Vogue.
The elderly lady is now famous in her home city for her social media pictures wearing the avant-garde Park label. A gallery of fashion pictures shows outlandish images including Ernie with a heron, covered in handbags and sticking out her tongue.
The former revue dancer has always been a fan of posing in front of the camera. But she went in to the Park store simply to pet the owners' dog. Shop bosses Markus Strasser and Helmut Ruthner spotted her photogenic potential and turned her into a star.
For Park, Ernie poses in unusual looks, but she admits that they would be "too extreme" for her everyday life.
She says: "I would not wear that on the street".
But with a growing follower count about to top the 10,000 mark, plenty of people like what they see when Ernie models the high-fashion outfits, so perhaps she should consider wearing one for a trip outside. Sky News

Kerala HC defends  SBI staffer terminated for being tipsy on  Sri Lankan flight
The Kerala High Court on Friday set aside the order of SBI life insurance terminating a staffer who lost his job for being intoxicated on a flight en route to a meeting. MG Venu, who had consumed too much alcohol, was deplaned from the Sri Lankan airlines flight
The incident occurred while Venu and other officers were en route to Colombo to attend a programme sponsored by SBI life insurance. The SBI treated the incident as a grave misconduct and punished him - with termination of service after which he challenged the order in the High Court.
The court observed that it was not a case of misbehaviour or misconduct on duty but, perhaps, on the way to duty. Taking that as a mitigating factor, the court concluded that the punishment imposed is shockingly disproportionate to the gravity of the offence.
The punishment imposed on Venu needs modification, the court held, and referred the matter to the authority to reconsider and impose an alternative punishment.
Confining to Venus conduct in office and his discharge of duties, even the employer did not sound uncharitable. That he got five promotions - including three in one year  speaks volumes about his efficiency. Groomed for long to be an asset to the employer, Venu has value, still, to offer to his employer, the court said.
Counsel for SBI life insurance submitted that it had confirmed the allegations with Sri Lankan airlines before taking action against Venu.
He was deplaned only because he had been inebriated, they said. When the court asked whether Venu was on an official trip, the counsel informed that there was ample material to establish that he was on duty.

May Days political  mayhem
Today, the first day of May is the workers' day. The day is fully assigned and promoted by International Labour Movement for workers to get together as co-workers. Some countries have declared this a holiday, making it possible for workers to come together to peruse the achievements they have gained and critically view their weak points.
How about our country Can we claim to be fair by the workers Do we really appreciate their labour
Ours is a sad experience. We speak high of a day for workers, though with the passage of time it has turned into a battlefield of divergent political parties. These parties get on to roads to test and show their strength over the rest.
When will the day dawn when labour get together to celebrate themselves in the spirit of the brotherhood giving meaning to this much sacred Workers Day It is sad that the politicians have manipulated this day to be the day of the political parties. The politicians and the political parties are using the day to test popularity.
The political parties which have lost their heads, and twisted the meaning of the Workers Day, show keenness in counting heads attending the rallies organised by the respective political party. This is not to talk about workers but to claim that one political party is more popular than the rest.
Spirit of brotherhood
Ironically it is the day of the workers. It's the workers who should rally round in the spirit of brotherhood. They, as workers, must celebrate the day, share their experience, exchange views and make reflections of the year gone-by and evaluate their achievements, their failures, their contribution to the progress of the country, to their personal lives and family lives, irrespective of all political, religious or ethnicity and class distinctions.
On the contrary, the workers have been put into cages, compartmentalized and given a political colour.
Work is more than a way to make a living. If dignity of labour is to be protected, then the basic rights of workers must be respected. What are they They include the right to productive work, to decent and fair wages, to the organisation and joining of unions, to private property, and to economic initiative.
If the May Day is the Workers Day, as we claim, then politics and politicians, of all rank and file, should be out.
There was no politics or politicians involved when the workers in their large numbers went on parade demanding eight hour work day, in Chicago, close to a century and a half years ago. It was a just demand of the labour to treat them as human beings not as animals. They are not slaves but men with human dignity.
We do not read that E A Gunasinghe's movement in 1927 was politically motivated. Later on politicians saw it as the playing field, a ground to play dirty politics, and grab power. With politics getting involved, the May Day lost its meaning and turned out to be a game benefitting the power-crazy politicians.
Worse still, the labourers have failed to realize that dirty politics have trespassed their sacred field. What they do not realise is that politicians have no love and concern to the labour force or the working class. They are all set up simply to showcase the strength of political mileage.
The politics have spoiled, given a twist to this turn of events. Plus, the workers are partly to blame.
In a statement issued on February 14, the Workers World Party claimed that time is up for a global general strike to raise the concern over the oppression of workers, make demand that world respect rights of workers, speak on behalf of the workers earning low wages, and to demand for a minimum global wage.
Demand for just wage
They also want to draw attention to the issues such as racism, white supremacy, neofascism, Islamophobia, attacks on immigrants, attacks on women and LGBT people, and a drive toward imperialist war. Whats more, the May Day global strike must be against the whole system of capitalism, imperialism and socialism. Forging a united front among the most militant and revolutionary forces can help this happen.
What we see is that the area is getting larger and larger while maintaining the first demand for dignity of labour, treat them as human beings and demand for just wage.
Coming into our own soil, we see there is a drift from the original political play, divide and rule. It is a blessing to witness how the two major political parties lived this long. The country is run on the concept of Yahapalayana, which is enriched by the teachings of great religions, especially Buddhism.
This Good Governance Government concept emerged as a result of the resolution adopted in 2006 by the General Assembly. It was introduced by the then Secretary General of the United Nations Organisation, Kofi Annan, with a view to help the developing nations, reduce corruption, bureaucracy and extreme poverty. The concept was also meant to encourage them to work for economic development. Yahapalayana Government is true to its commitment to the Good Governance Government concept.
This day was chosen to be celebrated as International Workers Day or Labour Day by Second International, a pan-national organisation of socialist and communist political parties to mark the Haymarket affair which had occurred in Chicago on May 4, 1886.
In 1904, the International Sociologist conference in Amsterdam, the Sixth Conference of the Second International, called on all Social Democratic Party Organizations and Trade Unions of all countries to demonstrate energetically on the First of May for the legal establishment of the 8-hour day, for the class demands of the proletariat, and for universal peace.
The Workers Day, or May Day as we prefer to refer, has its beginning at the National Convention held in Chicago in the 1884, organised by the Federation of Trades and Labour Unions, which was later referred to as America Federation of Labour.
The allegation was that America, one of the best industrialist countries in the world, the workers were forced to work 16 hours a day. They were treated as slaves not as human beings with dignity. The United as one Work Force, they decided to stage a protest, stop work demanding that eight-hour-day-work be adopted they went on strike on May 1, 1886.
On the day the world marked Centenary of the French Revolution, in 1889, the resolution was adopted to celebrate May 1 as Workers Day and the World began celebrating Workers on May 1, 1890.
Sri Lanka celebrated Workers Day for the first time in 1935. In 1956, the May Day was declared a holiday.

May  Day around the world
Isn't it strange that until the 19th century May Day meant maypoles, flowers, grass, picnics and welcoming the spring in countries like the United Kingdom, and nothing at all to people like us in Asian countries. In sharp contrast today, May 1st is a day of worker solidarity and protest; of speech-making, parading, brickbats, and conscientious violence almost all over the world.
China, the Philippines, France, Russia, Kenya, Brazil and Sri Lanka are just a sampling of the over 80 countries around the world who honor their workers on May 1, also known as International Workers' Day. The day has its origins in the movement for the 8-hour work day which largely took place in Chicago at the end of the 19th century. The first May Day was in 1886 when more than 300,000 workers across the U.S. walked out of their jobs in protest and began several days of protest and conflict with the police which would culminate at Haymarket Square in Chicago on May 4, 1886. On that day, many people - including many German immigrants had gathered at the marketplace to show support for the workers striking for an 8-hour workday when a bomb exploded, killing a policeman, and leading to gunfire that killed several people in the crowd, in addition to many injuries. So as not to evoke the memory of the riots and violence of this week in May in Chicago, President Grover Cleveland moved the official celebration of Labor Day to September in 1887 in the US.
The story obviously did not end there. If it did the whole world will be celebrating Workers' Day in September or never at all. But thankfully, a few years after the Haymarket Affair, some labor parties in Europe took up the cause to commemorate the Haymarket Martyrs and carry the fight for the 8 hour workday. In 1889, the International Socialist Conference declared May Day as the commemorative celebration it is known as in most of the world today.
Since then, around the world, May 1st has remained a day on which workers are given the day off and labor groups organize for protests and celebrations of the worker.
Global celebration
Over the past century, International Workers' Day has become a global celebration of union rights and a dedicated day for workers' rights activism. Today, celebrating this day of international action provides a chance both to give thanks for the groundbreaking work that has already been done for global workers' rights and for recognizing the work still left to be done.
In recent times, global worker's day celebrations saw mostly peaceful protests. In Jakarta, Indonesia, thousands of union members marched for improved working conditions. In Durban, South Africa, various trade unions marched together in a stand against xenophobic violence in the country. In Italy, a wreath was sent out to sea by labor leader Susanna Camusso in memory of migrants who died trying to reach European shores. An important official holiday in countries such as the People's Republic of China, North Korea, and the former Soviet Union, May Day celebrations typically feature elaborate popular and military parades. In modern Cuba May Day is massively celebrated with workers marching with their colleagues to the Revolution Square,Havana where special cultural and musical events are held as well as speeches from leading figures. Seen as the largest gathering in Cuba, every year more than a million workers, gather at the foot of the giant statue of Cuba's godfather of the Revolution - Jose Marti on this day. During the Cold War, May Day became intermittent for large military parades in Red Square by the Soviet Union and was attended by the top leaders of the Kremlin, especially the Politburo, atop Lenin's Tomb which became an enduring symbol of that period. In the countries that were part of the former Soviet Union, May Day is traditionally a celebration of the rights of the proletariat.
Kamgar Din
The first May Day celebration in India was organized in Chennai by the Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan on May 1, 1923. This was also the time when the red flag was first used in India. May Day is known as 'Kamgar Din' in Hindi, 'Kamgar Divas' in Marathi and 'Uzhaipalar Naal' in Tamil. In the Philippines, May 1st is known as Araw ng mga Manggaggawa and is a public holiday. Labour organizations and unions hold protests in major cities on this day.
In China, Labor Day was extended to 3 days during the 1990s. The Chinese government made it a seven-day holiday by moving the prior and upcoming weekends together with these three days. This holiday allowed millions of Chinese people to travel during this period. The Chinese government reduced the holiday period down to one day in 2008, while simultaneously reviving three traditional Chinese holidays: the Dragon Boat Festival, Tomb-Sweeping Day and the Mid-Autumn Festival.
In many countries, the May 1 holiday was obtained by trade union agitation supported by socialist parties. However, in Germany where such agitation had proved fruitless, it was instituted in 1933 as a gift from Hitler, being promptly followed by the abolition of trade unions. In the United Kingdom, a May Day Bank Holiday was instituted in 1978 for trade unionists to celebrate, but was held on the first Monday in May to minimize the damage to business.
May Day happens to also coincide with preexisting holidays such as Beltane, the Celtic Spring Festival, in Ireland and the traditional day for giving un brin de muguet (a sprig of Lily of the Valley) to loved ones in France, which dates back to the Renaissance.
Mindful awareness
Today, as we celebrate yet another International Workers' Day, let's make space to appreciate how our work connects us. As Sofia Marbach says in her article How to Celebrate International Workers' Day, perhaps as you start your morning routine, you could cultivate a new mindful awareness of the labor invested in everything that sustains you. Give thanks to the worker who treated the water running from your tap and the worker who helped deliver it to your pipes. Send gratitude to everyone along the chain of labor that made your morning cup of tea, possible.
Remember, a renewed appreciation for all the work that connects us can enrich our lives. Even simple things as shopping ethically considering both the human capital and natural capital put to work to make everything we have possible can help us move toward a more complete picture in which we can see and support both the people who grow what sustains us and the land working hard to produce it.
So, today as you end your workday, (hopefully not much more than 8 hours after you started it), take a moment to remember the people who fought to achieve this or, if you happen to be in one of those countries like ours that celebrate May Day, enjoy the day off!
As author Douglas Pagels said, "Sometimes it's important to work for that pot of gold. But other times it's essential to take time off and to make sure that your most important decision in the day simply consists of choosing which color to slide down on the rainbow." Make today, that day.

May Day messages:
Symbolizes victory of labour power: President
With a salute for the comrades of the working class celebrating the May Day all over the world, I am greatly pleased to send this message for the International Workers Day which symbolizes the historic victory of the glorious power of human labour that defeated the superior structures of the civilization, stated President Maithripala Sirisena in a message marking May Day.
The message added: The International Workers Day reminds us the arduous path in which the workers trod, sacrificing blood, sweat and tears from an era in which the iron-chained workers were considered as the property of the employers to the present day when the employers and employees could thrash out issues at a roundtable discussion. May Day gives an opportunity to mark the victories achieved by the Sri Lankan workers from the day when S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike declared May 1st as a holiday.
I wish to remind that the working class that has become a powerful force over the years through struggles has played a major critical role in the recent campaign to win back democracy in Sri Lanka.
They also have the responsibility to play a major role in the struggle to face the challenges of establishing reconciliation in Sri Lanka and achieve economic prosperity for the people. I believe that the working people will act as a responsible social force while strengthening their career rights, benefits and privileges while being sensitive to the entire gamut of the economic process of the country as well as new global trends.
This years May Day gives us more vigour as it is celebrated at a time when the Great Russian Revolution of 1917 marks its centenary celebrations. I join the working people who celebrate May Day today all over the world with warmth and encouragement. I also salute all the working comrades who sacrificed their lives, who raised their voices and shed blood and sweat for the human freedom and the labour rights.

unites workers of the world: PM
May Day celebrates a historic testimony of labour in all its dignity and sacrifice. It unites the workers of the world, in acknowledging that the global economy is indeed empowered by the workers and their service, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a message marking May Day.
The message added: Today, the workers are not only those who harvest the fields and fuel the machinery: as the concept of working is reinvented in the 21stcentury, the workers are also those who are engaged with their work via technology and the internet in the global marketplace. New definitions have also brought on new responsibilities and needs, ones that must be taken into account when we talk of worker interests.
The stage today is set for us to rise above the standard May Day celebrations to embrace a bigger, more relevant and meaningful concept with the participation of the private sector in Sri Lanka.
This May Day, may we experience the courage, the desire and the capability to go beyond the traditional definition, to encompass a greater dialogue that includes better working conditions, greater opportunities and ideas that deliver the kind of results needed in todays world of technology and connectivity.


Occasion to recognize achievements of working class: Sampanthan
The International Workers Day is an occasion to recognize the achievements of the working class and pay tribute to the sacrifices made by workers in securing economic and social rights all over the world, stated Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan in a message marking May Day.
The message added: Over the years, the working class has played a defining role in the making of Sri Lanka to what it is today. I would like to take this opportunity, therefore, to extend my gratitude to the working population for their tireless work and contribution towards the growth and development of our country.
Our nation is at a decisive juncture of her history. As such, I would like to call upon the working community, while striving hard toward the prosperity of our nation, to also remain sensitive and committed to the needs of national unity and reconciliation.
Finally, as we pause to reflect on the struggles, victories, and the challenges faced by the labour population, I would like to encourage all political parties to use its May Day celebrations as a platform to advocate the cause of the working community and an occasion to celebrate their efforts.

may day rallies  demonstrate more

President Maithripala Sirisena led Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe led United National Party, former MP Dinesh Gunawardena led Joint Opposition Party comprising a section of several SLFP members including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and those non- SLFP United Peoples Freedom Alliance(UPFA), Opposition Leader Sampanthans Tamil National Alliance, MP Anura Kumara Dissanayaka led Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, Lanka Sama Samaja Party(LSSP) and hundreds of trade unions will celebrate May Day today.
Whether this years May Day would demonstrate the power of the people or the power battle between key political groups and individuals, or would it display another day in which peoples conditions would be taken for granted may be understood later.
The Sri Lankan Freedom Party (SLFP) is all keyed up to hold its May Day rally in Getambe Kandy. SLFP-led UPFAs General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said their rally would be the one that would have drawn the largest number of political party leaders and masses in the country.
Amaraweera also predicted that tomorrows ( todays ) May Day rally organized by the Joint Opposition would be rejected by the people as it had been organized with a sinister plan to cause a division in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
He also said they would be displaying banners and hoardings of President Maithripala Sirisena in their demonstrations as he is the leader and the President of the party.
Since it was the United Peoples Freedom Front that had arranged to hold the Joint Oppositions May Day rally at the Galle Face Green in Colombo, it would be more appropriate for them to carry banners and hoardings of Prof. G. L. Peiris.
Meanwhile, the United National Party (UNP) says that its May Day is held with a focus to raise the income and the salaries of the workers, which we think is more important than all other matters considered. We do so at a time when the Joint Opposition members say that it would be foolish to increase the salaries of government servants. UNP General Secretary and Minister Kabir Hashim said Join Opposition member Udaya Gammanpila had said so.
Nevertheless, when the Joint Opposition requested that they be given Galle Face Green to hold its May Day rally, UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe gave it to them without hesitation, so that they may fill it to their hearts content, as they have already prided themselves saying, said Hashim.
As far as the UNP is concerned, our May Day rally is dedicated to people on the winning track, said Hashim, It is for the people who gain and people who want a change. We are at the ready to support such people.
Joint Opposition member Udaya Gammanpila said they decided to hold their May Day rally at the Gall Face Ground, which is eight times larger than the SLFPs selection of Gatembe grounds in Kandy, for holding their rally and five times larger than the UNP selection at the Campbell Grounds, Colombo, for holding theirs, because they have the fullest confidence of the people that they will throng not in thousands, but in hundred-thousands to Gall Face to demonstrate their opposition to the government .
This is the confidence we have in the people that they will throng in such huge numbers to Galle Face, to display their opposition to this oppressive and unpatriotic government, said Gammanpila.
We host the May Rally under the theme, May Day Rally for Protecting Motherland, Workeing Class and Rice- Paddy Fields,he said.
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna(JVP) will hold its May Day rally at the the BRC Grounds in Colombo. JVP says it focuses on giving the message of the importance of defeating the imperialist interventions and the capitalist movement that have been inhumanely burdening the working people of the country with such huge debts.
The JVP political panel said they would spotlight the fact the countrys capitalist political parties have been unable to and would not be able to create anything for the benefit of its people at their rally.
The Tamil National Alliances (TNAs ) May Day Rally will be held in Akkaraipattu in Ampara. The Nawa Sama Samaja Party has organised its rally at Price Park in Gunasinghapura. The LSSP will hold its rally at Ananda Samarakoon Grounds in Nugegoda, while the Communist Party will hold its rally at the Viharamaha Devi Park in Colombo.

May Day  reflections
Workers around the world celebrate May Day, also known as Labour Day and International Workers Day, today. It is a national holiday in more than 80 countries including Sri Lanka and the event is celebrated in some of the most staunchly capitalist countries too.
The May Day tradition is around 125-years-old, having begun as an agitation campaign against harsh working conditions by workers in the US in 1886. They were demanding a 40-hour working week. The slogan was eight hours for work, eight hours for rest and eight hours for what you will.
In the famous 1886 Haymarket incident in Chicago, US, police fire killed several trade union leaders and workers who were engaged in a demonstration seeking better working conditions and fewer working hours. It was usual for employers then to get their employees to work for 16-18 hours a day. It is generally accepted that these events eventually led to the adoption of the 40 hour working week.
In 1889, the first congress of the Second International, meeting in Paris for the centennial of the French Revolution and the Exposition Universelle, following a proposal by Raymond Lavigne, called for international demonstrations on the 1890 anniversary of the Chicago protests. May Day was formally recognized as an annual event at the Internationals second congress in 1891. However, the US and Canada now observe the Labour Day in September.
With the establishment of the United Nations, a specialist agency for labour matters, called the International Labour Organization (ILO) was created. In cooperation with Governments around the world, it has evolved labour charters honoured by all UN members. This has ensured much better working conditions than the demonstrators of 1886 ever envisaged.
Sri Lankans have observed May Day for decades. It is a vibrant event with rallies, demonstrations and parades. Over the years, May Day has been transformed into a political event based loosely on the significance of the day for the working class. It has become an opportunity for the political parties to show their grassroots strength and also their affinity to the working masses. Although one can no longer witness the massive May Day rallies of yesteryear, the day has still not lost its significance in our country.
Now the focus has shifted firmly towards political propaganda, with workers rights and struggles often relegated to the second place. Parties should strive to put the worker first in their rallies and meetings. This year too the parties have made elaborate arrangements for May Day.
The SLFP should be commended for taking May Day celebrations to the outstations  last year, their rally was held in Galle and this year, it is being held in the outskirts of Kandy. This gives outstation workers and party supporters to attend a May Day event closer to their hometowns. The UNP, as usual, has opted for Campbell Park where they held a successful rally last year. The Joint Opposition rally at Galle Face Green has already been subject to controversy as MPs Bandula Gunawardena and Basil Rajapaksa gave widely differing projected crowd figures of two million and 120,000. Filling the Galle Face Green is no easy task and how they cope with the challenge remains to be seen. The JVP too has stuck to its BRC venue, where they are likely to put up a very elaborate stage as is the norm.
In the end, it very hard to separate the labour movement from politics in Sri Lanka. The workers in many organisations are represented by trade unions which are for the most part affiliated to the major political parties. There are some stand-alone trade unions, that find it hard to raise their voice without the backing of a political party.
Sri Lanka has a vibrant trade union sector, especially in the one-million strong government workforce. Most private sector companies generally do not tolerate trade unions, but this is beginning to change. There also are a number of powerful professionals trade unions which should essentially be non-political but which have increasingly dipped their toes in political waters. The GMOA is a good example.
Most trade unions are well known for making demands from the Government in power. For this reason, many trade unions are nearly always at loggerheads with the Government. Some of the demands are reasonable, but most are not. Sri Lankas trade unions have a predilection for demanding higher salaries for their workforce, regardless of the economic situation of the country.
Trade unions should stop the current practice of resorting to strikes at the drop of a hat if their demands are not met. That should be a last resort, to be considered only when negotiations with the authorities fail. They should stop taking the public hostage when they strike to win their demands.
But do workers and trade unions pause to think of their obligations to their organisations and to the public This rarely happens. Work really is a two-way street. This May Day, both workers and employers must work towards addressing labour unrest and implementing better working conditions.

May Day SIX DECADES ago
The International Workers Day (also known as May Day), is celebrated worldwide on May 1 to remember the struggles of the labour movement of the past and present. It has been celebrated by marches and other activities in Sri Lanka since 1927. Some of these activities have evolved with the passing of time.
Sri Lanka's first May Day celebrations were initiated by the late A. E. Gunasinghe who formed the Labour Party to ensure workers' rights.
The formation of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) in 1935 was a landmark as far as Sri Lanka's May Day celebrations were concerned.
Leftist giants such as Dr. N.M. Perera, Colvin R. de Silva, S.A. Wickremasinghe, Peter Keumeman and Phillip Gunawardane were at the forefront of May Day rallies after the formation of leftist parties in Sri Lanka.
Their May Day rallies brought forth the fighting spirit and the revolutionary aspirations of the working class.
May Day was declared an official holiday in Sri Lanka in 1956 under the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna government, led by former Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. He also appointed centre-left politician T.B. Ilangaratne as the labour minister of his new government.
The May Day holiday allowed hundreds of thousands of workers across the country to participate in May Day rallies and extend their support to political leaders.
Many believe that the biggest May Day rally in Sri Lanka was the one held by J.R. Jayewardene at the Galle Face ground, in 1977.
The manner in which Sri Lankan political parties celebrated May Day changed drastically over the past few decades. It is a widely held belief that political interests have taken over workers' interests in May Day rallies nowadays. It has become an event for political parties to flex their muscles and pompously show off their support-bases.
Here, we look at how the Daily News reported the activities on May Day in the late 1950s.

Negombo-Bethlehem twinning in the offing
The Nativity Church of Bethlehem made a proposal to the Colombo Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith about a twinning agreement between Negombo and Bethlehem City. The proposal is supported by Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga.
Representative of Sri Lanka in Palestine Fawzan Anver, accompanied by Minister Amaratunga, recently handed over the request letter from the Nativity Church of Bethlehem to Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith.
The Nativity Church of Bethlehems Parish Priest Fr. Rami Asakrieh handed over the requested letter for the twinning agreement to Anver in Bethlehem.
In the letter, authorities of the Nativity Church state that people of Palestine and Sri Lanka are historically linked in trade and religion, with bonds of relationship stretching back to centuries in time.
The letter said, The holy city of Bethlehem and Negombo strongly share the holiness of Christianity, and being so aware, the people Bethlehem have shown immense Interest to share links of direct connectivity with the people of Negombo to establish and promote religious, cultural, and social ties between the people of the two cities. As such, we propose to establish links of Sister City between Bethlehem and Negombo.
It is the first such request made by authorities at the Bethlehem church for a twinning agreement with an Asian city.

No suitable land in Muthurajawela for a sanitary landfill
There is no suitable land in Muthurajawela to build a sanitary landfill, Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Director General K. H. Muthukudarachchi told the Daily News yesterday.
He said even though garbage dumping in Muthurajawela has been temporarily permitted considering the seriousness of garbage disposal issue in the aftermath of Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse, nowhere in Muthurajawela is suitable to build a permanent sanitary landfill.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha told Parliament on Friday that a landfill would be constructed in Muthurajawela within 40 days. While assuring to take all precautions to make it environment-friendly, the minister said the landfill would be used as an immediate solution to the Colombo garbage disposal problem.
Western Development and Megapolis Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka also spoke of his ministrys plans to build a sanitary landfill in Muthurajawela to dispose of the garbage generated in Colombo Port City and other proposed cities such as the tech city in Homagama.
Meanwhile, Wildlife Conservation Department Director General W. S. K. Pathirathne said he has asked for a situation report from the Wildlife Western Regional Office Assistant Director on garbage dumping at Muthurajawela.
I expect the report on Tuesday and will decide on the future actions after studying it. If necessary, I will inform the court. However, dumping of garbage at Bopitiya, a part of Muthurajawela Wildlife Sanctuary, has been stopped and now they are dumping garbage outside the sanctuary. Sanctuaries do not have buffer zones, unlike the National Parks. As per the National Environment Act, the CEA has the power to intervene up to a radius of 100 metres, he said.
When asked about the plans to build a sanitary landfill at Muthurajawela, he said, Various individuals may come up with various plans, but the project cannot be implemented without a comprehensive Environment Impact Assessment (EIA). Objections can be raised during the EIA process if necessary, he said.

One of a  kind
They were married just five weeks after their first encounter. Such was the impact that they had on each other. Now 35 years later they still live in blissful harmony. Blessed with three children who are young adults now, Athula and Rosy Senanayake are not ready to relax and retire from their busy lifestyle yet. Here Athula Senanayake, the beloved husband of Rosy Senanayake, unwinds his thoughts about his life with the woman whom he dubs as a unique personality in Sri Lanka because of her wide ranging experiences in diverse areas.
The wife and mother
We met in London in 1980 and we were married five weeks after our first meeting. It was a learning experience getting to know each other. I think she is an exceptional mother with all the protective qualities and other features that a mother possesses. However I think she has a double dose of all that!
Rosy as
Mrs World 1985
Ours is not a normal lifestyle. I am a restaurateur and my hours are regular. I have been having my own business since 1991. In most instances we cannot get together except for special occasions. Despite that I believe that we have a bond and relationship that has been built up as husband and wife. The children too have adapted to this because from day one it has been like this.
We were quite lucky because we had the children when we were quite young. Kanishka is 33 years and Thisakya is 30 years.
Our youngest, Radhya, is 26 years now. The days in which we were running around from one tuition class to another are over. All three studied in Sri Lanka and though they went abroad for their university studies, they returned back to the country. We are both happy about that because returning was their own choice. They are very happy here surrounded by their friends and family so we hope that they will settle down here as well.
Looking back we wonder how we managed. I think that it is a difficult period for any parent because there are various factors like effort and cost involved. It was not easy but we managed. The children are very close to their mother. She has always been there for them. We are a close knit family.
Greatestweakness
She is incapable of putting aside certain common sense suggestions and focus on what she or the party is saying. Certain politicians have this practice thought they know what other people are saying is also correct. However as a politician they have to pretend that theirs is the only solution that is available for a certain issue.
Rosy finds this task difficult because she is a very balanced person. Therefore she finds it difficult to ignore that there is some sense about what the other person is saying. She is not a hard politician but very sensitive to such issues.
She is a diehard UNP party person. I am a liberal thinker and I speak for both sides. Therefore we do not discuss politics often.
Habits andbeliefs
Rosy is very house proud. She believes in keeping the communication channels open always so that one can come to a better and broader understanding of things. She is a very likeable person so everybody was ready to help her wherever she goes.
Travels
Rosy has been to Israel twice but for holidays she likes to go to a place which offers privacy. People are not kind always. They are concerned about facts like what was she like, what was she wearing, she did not event glance their way etc. It is mostly a love-hate situation.
The public figure
When Rosy became a public figure she had to attend many social events. So we were out a lot. If we have an event I would take my suit to the office and change there before meeting up with her at the event. Life is like that. It has never been a conventional arrangement from day one. Rosy had less of a work load then before she became a part of the political set up.
Rosy has always been her own person. I have always been amazed how she has been able to adapt into the political and public figure that she is today. Many people find it difficult to handle this change. She has some advantages: the door has always been open for her and she is a likeable person. People relate to her a lot because they expect her to be unapproachable, arrogant and proud. However when they meet her they realize that she is the opposite of what they have expected. She is a very generous person. There is no limit to her generosity. She makes other peoples problems her own which is both a plus point as well as a weakness.
Free time
Though Rosy is a public figure she has never really used her titles to get what she wants. Everyone expects her to be perfect all the time. It is very demanding to be exceptional. She spends a lot of time getting herself ready for such events. When an event is over she just wants to collapse and relax.
She likes to keep up with the political issues. We watch political debates. People complement her in her Sinhala vocabulary in particular. She built up this aspect through listening to such programs. I too can speak Sinhala without using a single English word to express my point and I use the accurate word during the appropriate situation. Rosy used to do talk shows in the evenings and she was very talented at getting out information quickly.
Any free time she has, she spends it with the children. The children, too, have their own schedules now. Even my daughter and her husband live here with us.
Passions
She is passionate about womens issues in politics. One of her main concerns is to try and increase the percentage of womens representation in parliament. Even countries like Iran and Bangladesh have a higher representation of women in parliament. It is quite embarrassing for us because Sri Lanka has already had a female president and a female prime minister. Since the period of violence is far behind us I think women do not have an excuse for why they should not join politics now. Rosy is passionate about her religion  Christianity. I am a Buddhist in a fundamental sense meaning I believe in the essence of Buddhism. I feel that there are too many rituals that are coming into play now with poojas taking over elements like bavanas and teachings of the Buddha.
A different profession
It is difficult to imagine Rosy engaged in something else but I think she would always have been a campaigner. It was only when she became involved in such activities that we realized that this was what she was meant to be. She has worked with the Tea Board in London but I think she was meant for bigger things.
Favourite cuisine
Rosy is a rice and curry person. I am more into western food. Going out we visit all types of restaurants so she is not particular about what type of food she wants to go for.
She makes the traditional Christmas cake at home every year. There is like 40 kilos of it and the whole house is aromatic on the day she engages in her baking spree. She is very religious about the affair meaning that they all have to be cut in a particular size. It is the only time she does the cooking and she wishes to do it all by herself.
I suggested that she makes the wedding cake for our daughters wedding that was in December 2016. We were keen to make this affair as personal as possible. She made about a thousand odd pieces of wedding cake in our house.

Life with Rosyin a few words

Eventful because there is never a dull moment with her. We are meeting a lot of exciting people at events. She met Meryl Streep recently at a womens conference in London. She has met everybody: from Mohammed Ali to all the top actors and actresses involved in charity work.
Long distance because though we are in the same house she has gone by the time I wake up on some days. There is always communication as we talk to each other all the time. We have a family group on WhatsApp and we send messages to that and everyone responds. Though we are far away it is like we are all together in the same room.
Spontaneous because five weeks is a very short period to get to know someone before deciding to tie the knot. I am more planned but she has to be at two places at the same time so she is rushing off from one to another. It is more difficult for a woman than a man because a man can just put on a shirt and sarong and look smart. Men do not have to worry too much about appearances as long as they shave in the morning.
Togetherness time
Our time together now is generally during the small dinners and lunches we get invited to. Those are nice because they are intimate occasions. We interact at home too. I believe that for any couple, after a certain number of years, there is communication without communication. It develops with a lot of time together.

Animal lovers
I am a physical animal lover. We have always had dogs in the house. Our present pet, Jagger, is also in our daughters wedding album. Jagger was rosys birthday present and she is very fond of him. Some stray cats visit our house but I think we are not cat people.
Irritations
I think it is mostly me that irritates her! She gets irritated with herself because there is so much workload. She is concerned about cleanliness and wants things kept in a certain way. We as a couple have a lot of heated discussions on politics, the children or any other topics. I dont back down during such discussions and she knows that. Most of the time she knows that I am correct. Due to the old fashioned values that we have been brought up with we are concerned about doing the right thing.
Rosy in 10 years from today
I will be 70 years then she will be 68 years. Grandchildren will be our priority. We had the children when we were very young and we get nervous when we see older couples with very young children. We have no real plans per se because it has all really been about the children.
I believe that Sri Lankan parents rarely make long term plans. Obliviously, I would like to retire someday to a place like Nuwara Eliya and run a bed and breakfast place. We are still too involved with our childrens lives which we should not be at these ages.

which is Golden Prey, available now from G.P. Putnams Sons.
What was the first book you fell in love with
The first book I fell in love with was probably The Once and Future King by T.H. White. I would have been about 14 or 15 when I read it, and found it terribly heroic and romantic and tragic, everything a young teenager needs in a novel. I didnt actually own the book, but borrowed it and re-borrowed it from the public library, on the recommendation of a library lady who looked out for me.
What classic do you feel guilty aboutnever having read
A classic I feel guilty for not having read A la recherch du temps perdu, by Marcel Proust. A college literature teacher told me that I absolutely must read it, if I werent to be a literary idiot. He said the best way to do it was to find a hammock, and spend a summer reading it for an hour or two at a time. I honest to God havent had time to swing in a hammock that much, not since I got out of college. Its been one thing after another

Whats the book you reread the most
A book Ive reread the most: not a single book, but the whole series of thrillers by Ross Thomas. I worked through them over and over, both because I liked the stories, but also because I liked the writing, the way Thomas took thriller situations and twisted them. I wore those books out, and Thomas almost literally taught me how to write. My current books dont sound much like his, but my first onesthe Kidd seriesdid.
Is there a book you wish youhad written and why
A book I wish Id writtenQueens Gambit, by Walter Tevis. I cant tell you why. Again, its my kind of writing, and I found his perceptions and inventions to be fascinating. Tevis is a greatly underrated American writer. He didnt write that muchonly six novelsbut good God: The Hustler, The Man Who Fell to Earth, The Color of Money, Mockingbird, Queens Gambit, The Steps of the Sun. I mean, thats a terrific winning streak. - Lit Hub

PGTI speaks high of Pune Cup champ Anura Rohana
Sri Lankan Anura Rohana sprung a surprise on the final day of the Pune Open 2017 by setting the Poona Club Golf Course on fire with a scorching six-under-65. The fabulous effort by the seasoned campaigner fetched him his first title in two and a half years as he closed the tournament with a total of 10-under-274. In fact, the 43-year-old Sri Lankan, who has been playing in India for nearly 20 years, is much more at home on the courses here than the ones back home.
The second place was shared between Bengalurus Khalin Joshi (66) and Panchkulas Angad Cheema (69) at eight-under-276 at the Rs. 30 lakh event.
Vision and drive - anything is possible
Anura Rohana (71-68-70-65), lying tied seventh and three off the lead after the penultimate round, had a vision at the start of the final round that he would shoot a 65. As it turned out, his vision came true earning him his fourth title on the PGTI.
The 43-year-old Colombo residents day didnt begin as per plan as he dropped a shot on the opening hole.
What followed was a brilliant display of Anuras all-round skills as he accumulated four birdies on the front-nine including two from 10 to 15 feet. Rohana, who hails from the Royal Colombo Golf Club, started turning the tables on the others with a brilliant tap-in birdie on the 11th where he made an astounding recovery with his approach after a poor tee shot. Anura, the runner-up last week in Kochi, then chipped-in from 60 yards for eagle on the 15th to take the sole lead.
A millionaire within one day
A bogey on the 16th didnt deter Rohana as he notched a final birdie on the 18th to come home the winner by two strokes. Anura thus bagged the winning cheque worth Indian Rs. 4,50,000 (SLR 1,069,140) and moved up from eighth to fourth in the PGTI (Professional Golf Tour of India) Order of Merit.
It is not the putter is at fault but the mind
Rohana said, Im delighted to win after a long gap of two and a half years as my last win came in October 2014.
I had been playing well of late with top-5 finishes in my last two events on the PGTI. I had my chance in Kochi last week but was unfortunate to finish second. The new putter that I started using from the Indian Open onwards last month has had a huge impact on my game. My putting is much better than last season. Im also playing with less pressure now as I finally have a sponsor.
65 secret locker combination
This morning, I somehow thought of the number 65 as the combination for locking my suitcase. At that moment, I told myself that this might just be the number I end up shooting today. Thats exactly what happened.
Trust yourself be true to your self
I started believing I could win, when after a duff tee shot on the 11th, I landed my approach within three feet and made birdie there. That was the turning point for me. Then of course the eagle on the 15th set up the finish for me.
Be grateful to all things
Incidentally, I qualified for the Indian tour for the first time in 2002 after playing the Qualifying School at the Poona Club Golf Course. So its special to win an event here.
Khalin Joshi (68-70-72-66) produced an impressive 66, punctuated by six birdies and a bogey, on the final day, to rise from overnight tied 12th to joint second. His tied second finish ended up lifting him from third to second position in the PGTI Order of Merit.
Angad Cheema (69-68-70-69) hung on to his overnight joint second place as a result of his fourth round of 69. Cheema, playing in the leader group, was the only challenger to Rohana in the closing stages as he trailed him by just one shot at one point.
However, playing at two-under through 12 holes, he could only manage pars on the last six holes that put paid to his chances.

Police look for killer gang in Thalawathugoda
The Thalangama Police Crimes Branch had launched a special investigation to arrest a group of criminals involved in a murder which took place near Thalawathugoda on April 29.
A resident of No.20F/1, Mahajana Mawatha, Athurugiriya Ellaboda Gamage Ishara Sampath (25), a three wheeler driver, had been murdered on the same day by the gang.
The victim had gone to a night club on the first floor of a super market at Thalawathugoda along with two friends at about 1.00 am last Friday and had consumed liquor. As they were leaving the night club at about 3.00 am, they were attacked by the gang. Two of them managed to escape, but Sampath was captured and taken by the gang in a three wheeler.
Severely injured, Sampath was found near a house along the Thalawathugoda-Madiwala main road a few minutes later by some passers by.
They alerted 119 and the police rushed to the scene and had admitted him to the Colombo National Hospital. The victim had succumbed to his injuries at about 4.15 am while receiving treatment at the hospital. So far no arrests were made by the police in this regard.
Thalawathugoda police are investigating.

Polythene-eating  caterpillars
A commercially bred caterpillar can quickly break down polythene bags and may help get rid of the plastic waste accumulating in landfill sites and oceans, scientists say.
Researchers, including those from University of Cambridge in the UK, exposed around a hundred wax worms - the larvae of the common insect called greater wax moth - to a plastic bag. Holes started to appear after just 40 minutes and after 12 hours there was a reduction in plastic mass of 92 milligramme (mg) from the bag, researchers said.
They conducted spectroscopic analysis to show the chemical bonds in the plastic were breaking. The analysis showed that the worms - commonly used as
fishing bait - transformed polyethylene into ethylene glycol. To confirm it was not just the chewing mechanism of the caterpillars degrading the plastic, the team mashed up some of the worms and smeared them on polyethylene bags, with similar results.
"The caterpillars are not just eating the plastic without modifying its chemical make-up. We showed that the polymer chains in polyethylene plastic are actually broken by the wax worms," said Paolo Bombelli of University of Cambridge. "The caterpillar produces something that breaks the chemical bond, perhaps in its salivary glands or a symbiotic bacteria in its gut," Bombelli said.
The degradation rate is extremely fast compared to other recent discoveries, such as bacteria reported to biodegrade some plastics at a rate of just 0.13 mg a day, researchers said. "If a single enzyme is responsible for this chemical process, its reproduction on a large scale using biotechnological methods should be achievable," Bombelli said.
"This discovery could be an important tool for helping to get rid of the polyethylene plastic waste accumulated in landfill sites and oceans," he said. The study was published in the journal Current Biology. PTI

MiRo is the world's first commercial biomimetic robot, according to its creators, meaning it is a manmade device that mimics nature. It has been built by Consequential Robotics and the University of Sheffield .
MiRo is fitted with mini sensors so it can tell when it is being stroked or patted. It also has a sonar sensor in its nose so it can move around without crashing into things. The robo-pet could also have a number of practical functions, such as recognising people at the door or reminding its owner of diary events. The robot is designed to live among humans and provide emotional engagement, according to cbs46.com .
Maria Favre, studio manager of Consequential Robotics, said: "It has a companionship effect so when it's on and around you it really gives you that warm, buzzy feeling." "That seems to me an interesting approach.
"I don't want to take the human being out of care. Don't let's see robots as being replacements. Let's see them being add ons." Mirror

Self Generation  Scheme to  mitigate  power crisis
Generator owners registered with Power and Energy Ministry
550 MW contribution expected from bulk suppliers
As the power crisis deepens due to dry weather, the bulk supply customers registered with the Power and Energy Ministry have been informed to generate their own power from May 2 - 6 as part of the newly introduced Self Generation Scheme.
Ministry spokesman Sulakshana Jayawardena said this move is aimed at mitigating the current power crisis, adding that a contribution of 550 MW is expected from the bulk suppliers.
Over the past few months, the ministry was registering those who own generators to a self-generation scheme in which Rs. 36 is paid for each unit. Jayawardena said about 250 bulk supply customers have already been registered with the scheme, adding that factories and various public and private institutions are among them.

He said the ministry would conduct a review on May 6 and decide whether to extend it or not. He added this is a temporary measure to ease the power crisis as there is a drop in hydropower generation due to the scarcity of rainfall.

He said measures are being taken to improve the education standard of the Eastern Province and the Central Province.
People who do not like Sri Lanka having peace are creating problems. They use a Buddha statue or a kovil or a mosque to create problems. Buddhist, Hindu, Catholic, and Muslims religions do not preach any contradictions. It is the troublemakers who bring up these issues and create problems for the country, the President said.
Extremists are conspiring to destabilise the peaceful life of the people. In this small country, Buddhist, Hindu, Catholic, and Muslims faiths must live amicably. Religious leaders should get together and work towards this goal.
The Eastern Province is lagging behind in education. Though the North and East were affected by the conflict, North has improved in education, he said.

## Supertitle:

Top Container  Gardening Tips
Container gardening is a fun and satisfying method for growing your favorite plants. Here are 10 simple container-gardening tips to get you off to a strong start.
Select a Pot
Most plants arent fussy about the type of pot they grow in. All they want is enough space to spread their roots and a few good drainage holes to allow excess water to drain. Pots come in a variety of materials, such as terra-cotta, ceramic, wood, and plastic. All of them work equally well, although terra-cotta pots have a tendency to dry out faster than plastic or ceramic, so youll need to water them more often.
If you buy a new terra-cotta pot, soak it in a pail of water for a day or two to hydrate it before filling with soil. Some plastic pots might need drainage holes drilled in the bottom. Holes should be at least 1/2 inch wide; smaller holes might clog with soil and prevent the water from draining.
Choose the Right Soil
Fill your containers with a quality commercial potting soil. Never use soil directly from your garden because, when dry, it will harden into a solid mass. Quality potting soil should include generous helpings of some of the following amendments: peat moss, compost, perlite, vermiculite, and/or rotted manure. Inexpensive potting soils are not always a bargain, so read the label before you buy.
Pick Healthy Plants
You can grow almost anything you want in a container -- even trees and shrubs will thrive in a large enough pot. Most people prefer to grow flowers, vegetables, or herbs for their patio, porch, deck, or terrace. Enjoy an edible banquet by mixing a few of each type in the same pot. Strawberries and lettuce, for example, taste as good as they look and make great companions for sun-loving annual and perennial flowers.
Match Light Conditions
When selecting plants, read the plant tags before you buy so you know whether they grow best in sun or shade. You dont want to mix sun- and shade-loving flowers in the same pot. Top annuals for sun include petunias, geraniums, calibrachoa, and verbena. Some good annuals for shade include begonia, caladium, impatiens, and Torenia. All vegetables and herbs need full sun.
Plant in Layers
For a gorgeous layered look, be sure to include a tall, showy plant (thriller), a bushy medium-size plant (filler), and a trailing blooming plant (spiller) in your containers.
Container-Gardening Tip: Select varieties that complement each other in color and leaf form, too. There are many plants that are more prized for their gorgeous foliage than they are for their flowers.
Water Frequently
Container plants require more frequent watering than those growing directly in the garden. Water whenever the soil surface feels dry to the touch. During hot, sunny periods youll probably have to irrigate every day. This is especially important for hanging baskets that dry out faster because they are buffeted by the wind. You can use a watering can, garden hose, or install a drip irrigation system with a timer that waters your plants automatically every day.
Fertilize Regularly
To keep flowers and vegetables in top form all summer, youll need to fertilize them. Some potting soils have slow-release fertilizer already mixed in, but its still a good idea to add a few drops of liquid fertilizer every time you water. Flowers and vegetables are heavy feeders and will thrive with an extra dose of plant food.
Remove Faded Blooms
Annual and perennial flowers will look better when their old, faded blooms are removed. This process, called deadheading, will encourage a whole new crop of flowers to form. On larger species, such as geraniums, simply clip away the dead flower heads with your fingers or pruning shears. For annuals with tiny flowers, such as sweet alyssum, shear back the entire plant by about 1/3 with scissors or lawn clippers.
Renew and Replace
Even with excellent care, some annuals and perennials will begin to look tired by late summer. Instead of trying to revive them, carefully remove the plants from the pot and pop in one or two replacements to give your container a second life. Most garden centers offer replacement annuals in mid to late summer.

Tornado-like emission  seen from garbage dump
The methane gas emitted to the air from the Tekkawatta garbage dump in Gohagoda Kandy would have been visible to the public like a tornado, said Prof. Athula Senaratne of Peradeniya University.
This would have resulted due to the excessive heat experienced these days, he said.
Prof. Senaratne said since atmospheric temperature is 35-36 degrees Celsius, the underground temperature was likely to increase up to 40 degrees Celsius causing an emission of gas from the garbage dump. When the 40 degree Celsius temperature and humidity interacted with the carbonic layer developed in the garbage, it created the methanogenic bacteria which produced methane gas. When methane gas gets pressed against the polythene in the garbage, it erupted skywards like a dust cloud similar to a tornado from a loose area in the dump. But there was no evidence to suggest it to be an actual tornado. He said the Geology and Engineering Departments have launched an investigation into this incident.

Fernando PC made the suggestion when Dr. Wijewardena, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, was testifying yesterday (28) before the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issuance.
Fernando PC also suggested that this imaginary loss calculation' of Dr. Wijewardena has mislead the first COPE subcommittee chaired by then MP D.E.W. Gunasekara.
He suggested that Dr. Wijewardena used indicative interest rates and market behaviour to make this calculation. Fernando PC said Dr. Wijewardenas calculation has not considered as to what would follow after raising the government requirement nearing Rs. 10.5 billion in two year short tenure bonds. Dr. Wijewardena said he did indeed made the calculations based on assumptions and said he agrees with the initial recommendation given by the Public Debt Department to raise Rs. 2.6 billion using the auction method and the rest of Rs. 10.5 billion through direct placement method.
If one is calculating a loss, it should be done on net value, Fernando PC said. He asked whether Dr. Wijewardena is assuming that rest of the 10.5 billion would have been raised for the same rates.
Dr. Wijewardena said anybody can question his calculation, which is based on assumptions, but that he stands by his calculation since he believes he did his calculations based on the best assumption available in the market.
Fernando PC suggested that Dr. Wijewardena's calculation is done on worst assumptions available.
The Presidential Commission is to sit next Tuesday (2) again. JVP MP Wasantha Samarasinghe will be testifying before the Commission.

Tribute  to a courageous  media
World Press Freedom Day will be celebrated on Wednesday. It is observed annually on May 3 to inform the international community that freedom of the press and freedom of expression are fundamental human rights. This day reminds people that many journalists brave death or face jail to bring daily news to the public.
Advanced preparations for this years global celebrations have been planned for a multi-faceted focus on journalists safety and impunity for crimes committed against them in Jakarta, Indonesia. The 2017 Theme is: Critical Minds for Critical Times: Medias role in advancing peaceful, just and inclusive societies.
Against this background, the World Press Freedom Day highlights the links between press freedom, a culture of openness and the right to freedom of information, and sustainable development in the digital age. The common thread in all these is the role of journalism, and the importance of safeguarding those who bring this service to the public. It also gives people the chance to pay tribute to media professionals who risked or lost their lives in the line of duty. Several communities, organisations and individuals take part in this day through various events such as awards nights to honour those courageous journalists who brave all kinds of storms to bring you the news.
The importance of a free press
World Press Freedom Day was established by the General Assembly of the United Nations in December 1993 as an outgrowth of the Seminar on Promoting an Independent and Pluralistic African Press. This seminar took place in Namibia in 1991 and led to the adoption of the Windhoek Declaration on Promoting Independent and Pluralistic Media.
The Windhoek Declaration called to establish, maintain and foster an independent, pluralistic and free press. It emphasized the importance of a free press for developing and maintaining democracy in a nation, and for economic development.
Although World Press Freedom Day has only been celebrated since 1993, it has much deeper roots in the United Nations. Article 19 of the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights states that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression. This right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.
Each year since 1997, the UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize is awarded to honour the work of an individual or an organization defending or promoting freedom of expression, especially if it puts the individuals life at risk.
The award is named in honour of Guillermo Cano Isaza, a Coumbian journalist who was assassinated outside the office of his newspaper El Espectador in Bogota on December 17, 1986. Canos writings had offended Colombias powerful drug barons.
The award ceremony is held at the National Press Club in Washington DC.
UNESCO is also encouraging all those who are celebrating World Press Freedom Day to observe a minute of silence in memory of the journalists who have given their lives for our right to be informed.
It is a day of action to encourage and develop initiatives in favour of the freedom of the press:
*A day to assess the state of press freedom worldwide.
*It is a day to remind governments to respect their commitments to press freedom;
*A day to alert the public and to increase awareness of the importance of freedom of the press;
*A day of reflection to encourage debate among media professionals on the issues of press freedom and professional ethics;
*A day of remembrance for journalists who have lost their lives in the exercise of their profession; and
*A day of support for media which fall victim to any measures which restrain, or seek to abolish, freedom of the press.
Transparency and good governance
Freedom of the press is the freedom of communication and expression through vehicles including various electronic media and published materials. While such freedom mostly implies the absence of interference from an overreaching state, its preservation may be sought through constitutional or other legal protections.
With respect to governmental information, any government may distinguish which materials are public or protected from disclosure to the public based on classification of information as sensitive, classified or secret and being otherwise protected from disclosure due to relevance of the information to protecting the national interest.
Many governments are also subject to Sunshine Laws or freedom of information legislation that are used to define the ambit of national interest. Press freedom is considered to be a cornerstone of human rights and a guarantee of other freedoms. It encourages transparency and good governance and it ensures that society enjoys the rule of true justice.
Freedom of the press is a bridge of understanding and knowledge. It is essential for the exchange of ideas between nations and cultures which is a condition for true understanding and lasting cooperation. Information freely gathered and freely reported is the enemy of despots, dictators and criminal cartels.
For democracies, it would seem just as obvious that a free and unfettered flow of information is the lifeblood of systems that depend on an informed citizenry to make the ultimate governing decisions.
Newly created global news outlets on the Web, widely used social media, and so-called data dumps by groups like WikiLeaks do raise legitimate issues ranging from personal privacy, credibility to national security. Serious critics of the press, here and abroad, are right to point to errors of fact and judgment by journalists.
But on at least one day, we all ought to pause to appreciate the value - and for far too few, the unique national asset - that is a free press.
History is replete with individuals willing to risk their lives and liberty for the freedom to speak out. Indeed as far back as 399 BC the Athenians executed a courageous thinker who was committed only to the truth.
But not before the accused Socrates spoke out fearlessly to a jury at his trial: If you offered to let me off this time on condition I am not any longer to speak my mind... I should say to you, Men of Athens, I shall obey the Gods rather than you.

Trump Invites Duterte to the White House
President Trump on Saturday invited the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, to the White House, embracing an authoritarian leader who is accused of ordering extrajudicial killings of drug suspects and who crudely disparaged Trumps predecessor, Barack Obama.
Trump had a very friendly conversation with Duterte, according to a statement issued by the White House late Saturday. It said that the two leaders discussed the fact that the Philippines is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs.
In fact, Dutertes war on drugs has resulted in the deaths of several thousand people suspected of using or selling narcotics, as well as others who may have had no involvement with drugs. Human rights groups and many Western governments have condemned Duterte for the bloody campaign.
A spokesman for Duterte, Ernesto Abella, confirmed the White House invitation, saying that Trump had expressed his understanding and appreciation of the challenges facing the Philippine president, especially on the matter of drugs.
Trumps embrace of the Philippine leader comes a week after Trump called to congratulate President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey for his victory in a disputed referendum that cemented his autocratic rule. 
He has also lavishly praised President Xi Jinping of China in recent days for his cooperation in pressuring North Korea, overlooking the fact that Xi, too, has shown an increasingly repressive streak in his country.
Trump has spoken warmly of the Egyptian leader, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who seized power in a military coup. And he vowed during the presidential campaign to reset relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
An outspoken populist with a shoot-from-the-hip style, Duterte shares some characteristics with Trump. That was not the case with Obama, whom Duterte called a son of a whore when he was asked how he would react if Obama raised human rights issues with him. He later apologized, and his aides said his comment was an expression of frustration rather than a personal attack against the American president.
In its statement, the White House suggested that Trump was eager to mend relations. The presidents invitation, it said, was aimed at discussing the importance of the United States-Philippine alliance, which is now headed in a very positive direction.

University of Moratuwa EXMO: Budding  geniuses
Students at the University of Moratuwa hosted their second EXMO event last Friday and Saturday to show the public what they have been working on during the year.
The event was open to the public, and thousands flocked to the campus to see graduating students final projects and a number of exhibitions. The students also hosted classes and seminars to teach the masses some engineering basics. The Daily News visited the University on Friday and interviewed a number of students who had created some very impressive technologies.
Lakmal Meegahapola and his team won the 2nd place at the 2016 Microsoft Imagine World Cup Finals in Seattle, USA for an innovative system, named Amplus, that allows advertisers to better target products at people.
Normally digital billboards are not interconnected, which makes it difficult for advertisers to efficiently advertise their products. What we have done is to connect a camera to billboards that can identify men and women in the crowds in front of the billboard, Meegahapola said. The camera is linked with a database of ads, and, if the system determines there are more women than men in front of the billboard, it will display an advertisement targeting women.
Though Meegahapola did not mention the further applications of this technology, it stands to reason that the technology could be refined further in order to target different subgroups of people, such as children and the elderly, or even different races.
Prototype racecar
We are working to create partnerships with investors and some companies to expand the product. We are also trying to patent some of the features in Sri Lanka, he said.Last year, Team Shark, a group students from the University, built a prototype racecar to compete in the Formula Student 2016 competition at Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom.
To say they did well is an understatement. After competing against 134 teams from 34 different countries, the group won three awards: best newcomer in class 1, best individual driver, and the dedication to Formula Student prize. Induwara Munasinghe, the cars driver, also helped design and build the racecar, and noted that it was completely designed by the students. Students built most of the cars components, but they did use a 600cc Honda racing motorcycle engine.
Except for the engine and wheels and tires, we designed and built the whole thing. We made the chassis and suspension arms, and we did all of the welding, said Munasinghe, who also noted that the car could reach speeds just north of 200 km per hour. Though the team was excited to do so well during its maiden voyage on the Formula Student circuit, it is not resting on its laurels.
We are currently building a completely new car for the 2017 event. I can say that its way better. Its lighter, smaller, and more powerful. Its really a beast, Munasinghe gleefully noted.The team is setting its sights higher for this years competition, going so far as to import chromium alloy steel from the United States, as well as a lighter and stronger engine.
Prosthetic limbs
We want to do even better this year. Prosthetic limbs have come a long way in recent years, and Kalinga Nisal and his team. They are looking to further revolutionise these life-altering technologies. They have succeeded in creating a prosthetic device that responds to the EMG signals from muscles and the EEG signals from the brain.
Ship problems detector
The device they have designed is for transhumeral amputees, or patients whose arms have been severed between the shoulder and elbow.In the case of transhumeral amputations, the muscles of the lower arm are not present, so controlling the prosthetic device only with EMG signals is not possible. So, to overcome that issue, we are using EEG brain signals to control the hand itself while the EMG muscle signals control the elbow joint, Nisal said.
The LED lights on the prosthesis stimulate the brains visual cortex, an EEG headset captures the reaction, and then the patient can control the arm. The elbows motion is easily controlled with the EMG signals.A patient can use the prosthetic limb after only around 5-10 minutes of training, Nisal said.
Though the prosthesis already works nicely, the team anticipates making further improvements, such as the addition of tactile sensors on the prosthesis fingertips.We should be able to put it on the market in the near future. It will be a popular item since it is cheaper than most available prostheses. We use 3D printing and special CNC machine techniques to create materials that are durable and inexpensive. Its also powered by a rechargeable lithium polymer battery, he said.
A persistent problem container ship owners and operators have is how to efficiently and effectively inspect the hulls of their vessels. The team of Volanka Stepson, Nipuna Fernando, and Indika Madusha, has created a robot that they hope will help solve this issue.Their robot clamps onto dry-docked ship hulls with magnetic wheels and can fully examine the ships and then recommend what maintenance should be carried out.
The current methods of ship inspection involve having one or many individuals scouring the hulls while standing on a scaffolding or on cranes. These are costly and inefficient, and we hope our robot can change the way inspections are conducted, Stepson said.As of now, there is a camera mounted in the robots front section that can connect to phones and computers. But the team hopes to develop instruments that can measure the thickness of hulls to see whether there is corrosion. They also want to design painting and grinding mechanisms on the robot that will allow it to not only inspect but also repair ships.
The team tested the robot in the Colombo dockyard on April 27. The robot performed well, they said, as it was able to crawl horizontally and vertically. It successfully navigated while upside down.Though designed for ships, the prototype can crawl on anything made with ferromagnetic materials, such as steel.
Stepson noted that the materials used to assemble the robot cost about Rs. 180,000.The idea of wireless power transmission for electronic devices has been a rich area of research for electrical engineers for a few years now, and the fruits of these explorations have begun to trickle into the marketplace. You can now buy a device that charges your phone without a chord; you simply place it on top of a charging plate.
Ayesha Viduranga and his team designed a wireless power transmission that can transfer energy to more than one device. It has the capacity to charge computers and phones at the same time.Kavindu Dharmasiri and his team are trying to apply this technology to implantable medical devices. Either implantable batteries or hard conductors power most of these implants. The former must be surgically replaced, and the latter increase the risk of infection.
Wireless power transmission system
By using wireless power transmission, we have found that you can recharge implanted devices while they remain in peoples bodies. This would allow people to avoid having repeated surgeries to replace batteries, Dharmasiri said.
He explained that the implants could be charged simply by placing wireless power transmission systems above them on the skin.
Dharmasiri demonstrated this by holding a transmission system and an implant device on opposite sides of a piece of pig skin. Sure enough, the implant showed that it was charging.Nilesh Suriyarachchi and his team developed an autonomous robot that can map, in 2D and 3D, its surrounding environment. While the applications for such a technology are vast and varied, Suriyarachchi designed the robot with the retail sector in mind.
A big problem retailers have is identifying where items in a store are. People often pick up t-shirts and then leave them somewhere else, and to remedy this problem, retailers need to have a big workforce who have to go around and check the inventory manually. We want to fully automate this system, he said.The robot can go through the store, mapping the floor the whole time, and quantify the inventory while also identifying pieces that are out of place. Furthermore, people need not control it, as it can navigate on its own using an Xbox Kinect system.
The robot also has an obstacle avoidance mechanism so that it can avoid people that might get in its way, he said.

What do blind people dream
Every single human being on this planet dreams (even some mammals too). And while there are tons of people who cant remember their dreams when they wake up, they still get them. Human beings spend roughly around 6 years of their lifetime dreaming but have you ever considered what blind people dream about
Dreams are typically very visual experiences. They play against the senses and trigger strange sensations that can alter our perception of reality. They are complex phantasmagoric experiences that are shaped by the things we eat, how much exercise were getting, or what position youre in when youre asleep.
So how do blind people navigate dream land
Psych2Gos newest video answers that very question. Those who go blind very early in life or are blind from birth typically dont have visual aspects of their dreams. Yet, their dreams feature elevated levels of other senses. While those who go blind later in life continue to experience visual elements in their dreams.
It seems that blind people are very similar in their dreams to sighted people. They navigate a similar level of social interactions in dreams. However, blind people are more prone to nightmares particularly about getting lost, falling into manholes and getting hit by an unseen car.
Although the blind cant see with their eyes, they see in their dreams with other senses. Despite what you may think, blind people have no difficulty in visually representing the content of their dreams.
Hows that for a weird fact UPI
