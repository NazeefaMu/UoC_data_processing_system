Bowlers who sledge are cowards: Andy Roberts

As the elevator of a five-star hotel rushed from zero to the 23rd floor, it was sort of ironical to hear the hotel's guests talking about the speed of the lift, without realizing they had Sir Andy Roberts for company.
The legendary West Indian fast bowler too enjoyed the moment away from public attention that he has been used to getting since 41 years of him as a cricketer.
Roberts, 64, was in Pune to visit cricket museum Blades of Glory, and the former right-arm pacer, who was part of the famous West Indian quartet along with Michael Holding, Joel Garner and Colin Croft, spoke to TOI about contemporary cricket.
Like his bowling, his replies to all the questions were as sharp as they could.
Excerpts:
Q: You were part of world cricket's most feared bowling attack. Have you seen a pace attack like that in any of the present teams
AR: No I haven't seen it and I am not going to see it. I am not saying it won't happen, but I don't think I will live to see it because that 'quartet' was different. Today you can't put four different bowlers like that together. We were all different in everything you could think of. We were different in height, we were different in mannerism, we were different in temperament and we were different in skills. I think that's what made the combination so good.
Q: You must be good friends off the field to share a bond like that while playing
AR: Not all four were good friends. I am still friends with Michael (Holding), but with the others (Garner and Croft) I never socialised while we were playing. We were friends, but to say we were close won't be right. But on the field everyone was for everyone. We had a common thing: we all hated losing.
Q: A lot of aggression was expressed through the eyes of the bowlers in your era. How do you see young fast bowlers indulging in sledging to heat the contest up
AR: Sledging has always been there. I don't think they sledge half of as much now as they did in the past. One more thing about sledging is that the bowlers who sledge are cowards. Why do you have to get in someone's face You have the ball in hand, let the ball do the talking.
Q: When West Indies, England and Australia boasted of fast bowlers, India had their quartet of spinners. Down the line, do you think India has the same level of quality spinners
AR: No. I don't think India has stuck to their strength that was spin bowling. Now they are dependent more on doctored pitches to suit the spinners. So the Indian spinners don't get much juice outside India because they don't get the assistance as they get at home.
Q: Are you referring it to the Nagpur Test
AR: It isn't about just Nagpur Test, it is about all the Tests. Home advantage should be avoided.
Q: How do you see India's progress as a Test team
AR: I see India have decided to play a couple of fast bowlers and that makes the difference in Test cricket. I think they need to develop a programme where they have bowlers who can consistently bowl at 90-95mph. Until they do that, they will not be able to compete outside India. And if you want to be world champions, you need to do well outside your territory.
Q: So what should they do to bowl consistently
AR: Indian bowlers need to bowl as much as they can because people say they shouldn't over bowl in practice. But it is difficult for me to play a Test match after bowling four overs in the practice and then expect me to bowl 20 overs in a day. That is why I believe so many injuries occur, because bowlers get tired in the match.
Q: West Indies cricket is nowhere close to where you had left.
AR: There is so much wrong with West Indies cricket that it will take me two days to complete the answer, so I don't even want to start. Priorities are changing and most of it started right here in India. West Indies are the only team that suffered because the players are not prepared to go back for international commitments. I don't agree with their thinking. Some of them may tell you that they don't owe anything to West Indies cricket, but they some gratitude towards the West Indies cricket board and public, because they didn't come up by themselves. They came up through a system provided by their territories and the cricket board. If I had anything to do with the board, none of them would be playing it (for the clubs) because I wouldn't be signing any NOCs. You have to commit yourself to represent your territory if required. If your best players consistently take part in domestic cricket, your team cannot come up.
Q: You had openly expressed your displeasure about a LBW decision that went against you while bowling to England's Peter Willey. In today's context, do you think the review system is a good technology
AR: There are so many things that are flawed. But if there is some technology that assists the umpires, why not use it. My only problem with the technology is the ball tracking system. According to the technology, everything goes above the stumps. Even though you hit the ball below the knee, it goes over the stumps and that is my biggest problem (with DRS). The cameras I believe are up high and you are trying to judge the height of the ball from up high. When you see it with the naked eyes, you know it is not going high. But having said that, I believe DRS should be continued. It takes a lot of pressure off the umpires, because even today the umpires make a signal, they don't have guts to say whether you are out or not out. - TNN

Djokovic and Nadal ease into Qatar Open quarter-finals

DOHA, WEDNESDAY: Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal breezed through to the Qatar Open quarter-finals on Wednesday, raising hopes the pair will appear in a dream Doha final later this week.
Number one seed Djokovic lost just four games in a comprehensive defeat of Spain's Fernando Verdasco with the world number one triumphing 6-2, 6-2, in one hour nine minutes.
He was matched straight after on Centre Court by Nadal, the tournament's number two seed, who swept aside Robin Haase 6-3, 6-2 in just 65 minutes.
Djokovic's victory matched the result of his first round clash against Dustin Brown and means the Serb has spent just two hours on court in the first two rounds. Ominously for his rivals, Djokovic looked already to be getting back to his dominant form of 2015 where he won three of the season's four majors.

"Very pleased with the way I have started this season, two matches, straight sets," he told reporters afterwards.
"Of course there are things that I think I can still do better, but again I have to be satisfied with how I played the first two matches."
In the warmest temperatures experienced in Doha this week -- 20 degrees Celsius (68 Fahrenheit) -- Djokovic controlled the match from the very beginning. He first broke Verdasco's serve in the fourth game and was rarely troubled after that. The Serb squandered another break point just two games later but eventually closed out the set on Verdasco's serve to go one up in just 31 minutes.
Verdasco, the world number 49 who had beaten Djokovic four times in their 11 previous meetings, offered some resistance in the second set but only enough to delay the inevitable.
The Spaniard, who may have been feeling the effects of his first round victory less than 24 hours before, missed two break opportunities in the second set and was made to pay.
The Serb will play the number eight seed, Argentina's Leonardo Mayer in the last-eight.
It was in the third round last year that Djokovic crashed out of the Qatar Open, losing to Croatia's Ivo Karlovic.
Nadal was just as impressive in his victory over Haase. He broke the Dutchman early on and never looked back.
"(I am) just very happy to be through, I think I played a very strong match," said the Spaniard.
"I think I returned so well tonight. And the serve was a little bit worse than yesterday, but in general, I played much better than yesterday, no "So very happy with the victory and with the level of tennis."
Nadal had struggled in the first round on Tuesday, finally coming through after dropping the first set against compatriot Pablo Carreno Busta. He plays Andrey Kuznetsov in the last eight. Number three seed Tomas Berdych is also through to the quarter-finals after the Czech beat Bosnia's Damir Dzhumar 6-0, 6-4 in a one-sided match.
He next plays British qualifier Kyle Edmund who won a third set tie-breaker against Daniel Munoz-De La Nava, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6.
Earlier Jeremy Chardy won an all-French clash beating Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-2, 6-4.
Chardy will play the surprise player of the tournament, Ukraine's Illya Marchenko, who followed up his impressive first round defeat of defending champion David Ferrer with victory on Tuesday over Teymuraz Gabashvili, 6-4, 6-2.

Everton boss hails Barry as one of England's best

LIVERPOOL, THURSDAY: Everton manager Roberto Martinez described Gareth Barry as one of England's finest ever players after he helped guide his team closer to the final of the League Cup.
Barry, 34, produced another impressive midfield performance as he orchestrated a 2-1 win over former club Manchester City in the first leg of their semi-final at Goodison Park.
"Gareth Barry is one of those players that gets underrated. For me the big reason why we have so many effective young players is there are leaders in the mould of Gareth Barry," said Martinez.
"I have never seen a player with such incredible professionalism, standards and so level-headed as Gareth Barry. For me he is one of the best English players ever.
"He could end up with 600 Premier League appearances this season. The way he behaves and the way he plays you can build a team around him.
"It's no coincidence that we have so many players being successful at our football club through the presence of someone like that."
Barry, who has played 576 Premier League games and been capped 53 times by England, joined Everton from City in 2014 following a successful season-long loan.
It was his cross which gave Romelu Lukaku the chance to head Everton's late winner after Jesus Navas had cancelled out Everton's opening goal from Ramiro Funes Mori in Wednesday's clash.
Martinez claimed it had been a landmark win for his side against the 2014 competition winners and Premier League title challengers as Everton look to set up a possible final date against Liverpool, who hold a 1-0 lead over Stoke in the other semi-final, and end a 21-year wait for a trophy.
"It is more than happiness. I am very, very proud of the performance," said the Everton boss.
"We faced Manchester City in August and were missing something. Internally it shows how far we've come and the real intent of this team to be successful. - AFP

Guptill flyer sets New Zealand up for three-run win
Mount Maunganui, Thursday: In-form batsman Martin Guptill cracked 58 off 34 balls to set up New Zealand for a tense three-run win in the first Twenty20 international against Sri Lanka on Thursday.
Sri Lanka had three wickets in hand and required 13 off the last over by Grant Elliott at Mount Maunganui but could only manage 10 runs as they lost two wickets.
KaneWilliamson plays a shot AFP
The result put the pressure on Sri Lanka to win the second and final game in Auckland on Sunday or they will slip from first to third behind the West Indies and Australia in the world rankings.
New Zealand, sent into bat first at Bay Oval, made 182 for 4 in their 20 overs and Sri Lanka replied with 179 for 9.
Sri Lanka lost early wickets and were 86-5 at the halfway stage with top scorer Danushka Gunathilaka back in the pavilion after hitting 46 off 29 deliveries.
Tillakaratne Dilshan went at the start of the second over and captain Dinesh Chandimal was out in the third over as they tried to force the pace against the bowling of Matt Henry and Trent Boult.
Milinda Siriwardana (42) and Thisara Perera (28) started to repair the innings with a stand of 49 in 27 balls for the sixth wicket and Chamara Kapugedera (17) and Nuwan Kulasekara (14) kept up the pressure.
But on the third ball of the final over Kulasekara was well caught in the deep by Boult and Kapugedera was run out on the next delivery. Guptill and Kane Williamson gave New Zealand a flying start bringing up their century partnership at the start of the 11th over.
But they had no sooner passed 100 when Guptill was first to fall for 58 when he was run out by a side-on throw from Kapugedera on Williamson's call for a quick single.
Williamson followed soon after for 53 off 42 while Colin Munro scored 36 and Ross Taylor was not out 22.
For Sri Lanka, Kulasekara took two for 26, while the leading bowlers for New Zealand were Boult with three for 21 and Henry with three for 44. AFP

H-bomb: More powerful than Hiroshima bomb, fits on missile

US: The announcement on Wednesday from North Korea that it had carried out a nuclear test brought to the frontlines of global attention a phrase not often heard since the Cold War "the H-bomb".
As opposed to the atomic bomb, the kind dropped on Japan in the closing days of World War II, the hydrogen bomb, or so-called "superbomb" can be far more powerful, experts say, by 1,000 times or more.
North Korea's first three nuclear tests, from 2006 to 2013, were A-bombs on roughly the same scale as the ones used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which together killed more than 200,000 people. Pyongyang announced on Wednesday that it had detonated its first H-bomb; while seismic data supported the claim of a large explosion, there was no immediate way to confirm the type.
Atomic bombs rely on fission, or atom-splitting, just as nuclear power plants do. The hydrogen bomb, also called the thermonuclear bomb, uses fusion, or atomic nuclei coming together, to produce explosive energy. Stars also produce energy through fusion.
"Think what's going on inside the sun," says Takao Takahara, professor of international politics and peace research at Meiji Gakuin University in Tokyo. "In theory, the process is potentially infinite. The amount of energy is huge".
The technology of the hydrogen bomb is more sophisticated, and once attained, it is a greater threat. They can be made small enough to fit on a head of an intercontinental missile.
"That the bomb can become compact is the characteristic, and so this means North Korea has the U.S. in mind in making this H-bomb announcement," says Tatsujiro Suzuki, professor at the Research Centre for Nuclear Weapons Abolition at Nagasaki University.
But the H-bomb requires more technology in control and accuracy because of the greater amount of energy involved, he said. Both the A-bomb and H-bomb use radioactive material like uranium and plutonium for the explosive material.
The hydrogen bomb is in fact already the global standard for the five nations with the greatest nuclear capabilities - the U.S., Russia, France, the U.K. and China. Other nations may also either have it or may be working on it, despite a worldwide effort to contain such proliferation.
The hydrogen bomb was never dropped on any targets. It was first successfully tested in the 1950s by the U.S., in bombs called Mike and Bravo. Soviet tests soon followed. - THE HINDU

Hafzel Preena wins Red Bull Kart Fight 2015
After two days of burning rubber, Hafzel Preena took the chequered flag as the winner of the second edition of Red Bull Kart Fight, Sri Lanka's only international amateur karting competition which took place at the Kanway Autodrome in Mirigama on December 19 and 27.
"To be honest, this is my very first karting championship so the feeling is unbelievable," said Hafzel.
"I've been watching Formula 1 for a couple of years now and I am a major fan of Sebastian Vettel. On top of that, I was lucky enough to meet Daniel Ricciardo when he came for the Red Bull Show Car Run in Sri Lanka.
Together with my friends' and family's constant support these experiences have truly been inspirational and I owe it to them for my victory today."
Red Bull Kart Fight is an international amateur karting competition that gave drivers across Sri Lanka the chance to experience wheel-to-wheel action and the smell of burning rubber for real. This year's competition took place on a verdant circuit in Mirigama that offered over a kilometre of long straights, chicanes and inclines over several rounds of qualifiers before culminating in the grand finale. After finishing at the top of the qualifiers, Hafzel Preena emerged victorious from a pool of nearly 300 registered karters with a best lap time of 25.30 seconds in his final race.
"Over the race weekend, I witnessed an incredible amount of budding racing talent and determination," said Mazdayar Vatcha, Race Director of Red Bull Kart Fight 2015. "The abundance of motorsport potential that Sri Lanka has is overwhelming. Red Bull has done a fantastic job in nurturing this potential talent, and I hope it continues to inspire a new generation of racers that are ready to give Sri Lanka the glory it deserves on circuits around the world."
As the champion of Red Bull Kart Fight 2015, Hafzel Preena will soon be heading to England for an exclusive tour of the Red Bull Racing Factory to witness all the action behind the scenes of the world famous Infiniti Red Bull Racing Team, and will also get a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience the thrill of a Ferrari F430 Coup or an Aston Martin V8 Vantage on the UK's only Formula 1 track at the Silverstone Grand Prix Circuit.

Kandy SC continue to stamp their authority

Kandy Sports Club the reigning league rugby champs of Sri Lanka once again showed their might in this year's tournament with six wins out of six matches played in the first round. The team led by Fazil Marija was ruthless from the kick-off with the motive 'Must Win' attitude carrying them to victory. They withstood the rousing fight back staged by Havelock Sports Club before crushing those 18-8 in their own den under lights.
Surprisingly it was a packed house, and in the gallery there were some famous former rugby players and fans soaking in the evening's action,
The display from the defending champions was a fault-free performance - they always seemed to have this sixth gear they can click into that no other team has.
There is every possibility that they will go through the calendar year undefeated. Their last first round game is on Sunday at Nittawela grounds against Navy Sports Club.
Kandy SC have spent in the last two and half decades or so trying to simplify the way they play the game. On Saturday we saw how far they have got there. They are good in every facet. Solid set-pieces, brilliant break downers, a defense that is incredibly mean, and an attacking team that no other side can match. Whatever said and done the best team won Saturday's block buster clash.
Kandy dazzled with their running and handling of the ball and effectively outlasted the Park Club, who failed with a poor tactical kicking display that played into the winner's hands.
There were a few errors that led to Havies losing, but the main one was their lack in tactical kicking. You need to kick very accurately against a team like Kandy SC or they will punish you. You just can't afford to give them free possession in an area where it is easy for them to run it at you. There were some positive points for the losers particularly in the first half, when they dominated the line outs and also were good in loose play, but lacked good finish.
They enjoyed a really good first half, and the 40 minutes was outstanding, but just before half time they started to lose control of the game and allowed Kandy to take charge.
For the losers there were a lot of tired legs as they make slow progress beyond the half-way line, desperately searching for a gap in the opponent's defence.
They had a lot of ball, but failed to make use of valid possession, the absences of some of their key players were badly felt.

Lukaku gives Everton semi-final edge over City

LIVERPOOL, WEDNESDAY: Romelu Lukaku's 19th goal of the season gave Everton a 2-1 win over Manchester City in their League Cup semi-final first leg clash on Wednesday. Everton haven't lifted a trophy since the 1995 FA Cup but they took a step closer to Wembley and a possible repeat of their 1984 League Cup final with local rivals Liverpool thanks to Lukaku's late winner.
Liverpool lead Stoke 1-0 from the first leg of their semi-final and Manchester City will still be hopeful of turning this tie round as they look to repeat their 2014 success in the competition. When Jesus Navas cancelled out Ramiro Funes Mori's first-half goal, City looked to hold a slender advantage ahead of the home leg in three weeks' time but Lukaku's headed goal 12 minutes from the end means the underdogs hold sway.
Having won only three of their 11 Premier League games at Goodison Park this season -- conceding 20 goals in the process -- home advantage could have been seen as negligible for Everton as they looked to reach the semi-finals of the competition for the first time since 2008.
City's win at Watford last Saturday was their first away from home in the league since September but they did score four times in winning at Sunderland to launch their League Cup run and had rattled in 13 goals in three ties to reach the last four.
They started as they meant to go on as they continue a pursuit of four possible trophies with all the possession in Everton's half in the opening stages.
But Roberto Martinez -- who masterminded Wigan's shock FA Cup final win over City in 2013 before joining Everton as manager later that month -- is happy for his team to soak up early pressure as he tries to solve Everton's defensive problems.
And having kept City at arm's length, bar a header from Nicolas Otamendi which went just wide following a corner, Everton grew into the game as an attacking threat.
Twice the home side had the ball in the net but John Stones and Lukaku were rightly penalised for off-side. But then after Sergio Aguero had gone close for City with efforts saved by Joel Robles and blocked by Funes Mori they did make an effort count by taking the lead a minute into first-half stoppage time. Again Lukaku strayed into an off-side position but the ball dropped instead for Funes Mori after Willy Caballero had saved Ross Barkley's fierce shot following a corner and the defender hooked in his second goal for the club.

Naib stars as Afghanistan win series against Zimbabwe

Sharjah, Wednesday : Gulbadin Naib hit a career best, undefeated 82 as Afghanistan defeated Zimbabwe by two wickets to win the fifth one-day international and take the series 3-2 on Wednesday.
Naib smashed six sixes and three boundaries in his 68-ball knock as Afghanistan chased down their 249-run target to claim a second successive series win over Zimbabwe after winning in Africa in October.
Naib's final six came off the third last ball after his team had been 121-5 at one stage.
His partnership of 85 with Rashid Khan for the seventh wicket proved key after Zimbabwe had appeared to be on course for a third successive win in the series after losing the first two matches.
Hamilton Masakadza had hit 110 after Zimbabwe batted first while Peter Moor (42) and Richmond Mutumbami (40) also starred as the African side had been 167-3.
Afghanistan were 66-3 in reply after fast bowler Luke Jongwe sent back Mohammad Shahzad, Noor Ali Zadran and Narwoz Mangol.
But Hashmatullah Shahidi and Mohammad Nabi steadied the innings before Naib took charge with his man of the match performance.
"The partnership with Rashid helped and gave me the energy to carry on," Naib told cricinfo.com.
Afghanistan skipper Asghar Stanikzai hailed his team's win which also cemented their place in the top 10 of the world rankings. AFP

Peterhansel wins as Peugeot dominate Dakar fourth stage

SAN SALVADOR DE JUJUY,, WEDNESDAY: Stephane Peterhansel kept a float his bid for a 12th Dakar Rally crown when leading a Peugeot clean sweep in Wednesday's fourth stage around Jujuy in Argentina.
The marathon event's all-time most successful competitor held off teammates Carlos Sainz and Sebastien Loeb by 11sec and 27sec at the end of the 429 kilometre stage.
This was the veteran Frenchman's 66th stage win, a record tally split equally between cars and bikes.
The 50-year-old from Alsace made his Dakar debut in 1988, winning the first of his six overall victories on two wheels back in 1991 and taking his 11th victory behind the wheel of a Mini in 2013.
World rally legend Loeb, with two stage wins in the bag already on his promising Dakar debut, remained atop the overall standings with Peterhansel in second at 4min 48sec. Defending Dakar champion, Qatar's Nasser Al-Attiyah (Mini) is third at 11min 9sec.
Al-Attiyah, who won bronze in the men's skeet shooting event at the London 2012 Olympics, reflected after his fourth place: "It ain't easy.
"I did my best to attack, but you just can't keep up with the Peugeots."

Taming North Korea: A losing struggle

KOREA: North Korea's latest nuclear test poses a stark challenge to the international community which, analysts say, will struggle to come up with a concerted, effective response, despite the chorus of global outrage at Pyongyang's move.
Condemnation of the North's claim on Wednesday to have tested its first hydrogen bomb has been swift and universal, but the real battle will be converting the indignation into concrete action that has the same across-the-board backing.
While the UN Security Council has agreed to draw up "significant" punitive measures, there seems little consensus on what can effectively be added to the rafts of sanctions imposed on North Korea following its three previous tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.
Wednesday's test amply demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the sanctions regime to date, and the core debate now is whether the way forward lies in harsher sanctions, dialogue -- or a combination of the two. Current US policy, backed by ally South Korea is one of "no reward for bad behaviour" and requires North Korea to take a tangible step towards denuclearisation before proper talks can begin -- a pre-condition many view as hopelessly unrealistic.
"Sanctions alone just aren't working, we've seen that," said Joe Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, a global security foundation and author of "Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late".
"There has to be a path opened to discussions, however difficult that may be to swallow," said Cirincione, who added the current US strategy amounted to little more than the hope that ignoring Pyongyang might make it go away.
"But North Korea is like that Glenn Close character from Fatal Attraction. It will not be ignored," he added.
Pyongyang's claim that Wednesday's test was a sophisticated hydrogen bomb has been largely dismissed by experts, who say the apparent yield was far too low for such a powerful device. For now, the general consensus is that it could have been a boosted-fission bomb, which would be more powerful than the simply fission implosion devices it tested before, but far short of a genuine two-stage H-bomb.
But whatever device it turns out to be, the message from North Korea is the same -- no matter the cost exacted by the international community, it will continue to develop its nuclear weapons capability.
"Success in developing simple thermonuclear devices is likely a matter of time and a relatively small number of additional tests," said David Albright, president of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security.
"A priority must be to find ways to both further pressure North Korea to limit its nuclear weapons capabilities and engage it diplomatically," Albright said.
There is room to increase pressure by imposing the sort of extensive economic sanctions that helped bring Iran to the negotiating table over its nuclear programme. But to be effective, these would impact Chinese companies and financial institutions that account for the lion's share of North Korea's overseas business. China is likely to balk at any such move and Washington would be wary of pushing Beijing at an already sensitive time for relations between the two powers.
And the United States will have trouble enough just coming up with a unified strategy of its own, given the toxic nature of the North Korean issue in election season.
US Republicans have gleefully painted the latest test as another foreign policy failure for President Barack Obama's outgoing administration, and it would be a brave presidential candidate who suggested dialogue with Pyongyang as a way forward.
China, meanwhile, is unlikely to back any moves that could genuinely destabilise the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, given its overriding fear of a reunified, US-allied Korea directly on its border. "China, no matter how strong the language it uses in its criticism on the North, will not join any Security Council punishment that may have a real impact on the North's regime," said South Korea's former national Security Adviser, Chun Young-Woo.
"And North Korea knows that," he added.
So if China won't back genuinely punitive sanctions, and the US sticks to its policy of not engaging North Korea, the prospect of any new response to the North's latest provocation looks quite bleak.
Cirincione, however, hopes that the shock of the H-bomb announcement -- whether a bluff or no -- might have been enough to push Beijing to increase pressure and Washington to risk exploring a dialogue route.
"And it is a risk, because there's no guarantee negotiations will work. But then nothing else has worked. "So it just seems the risks of inaction must be greater than the risks of action," he said.- AFP

Warner blasts fastest SCG ton in Windies Test draw
Sydney, Thursday: Australia's David Warner lit up the final day of the rain-ruined third Test with the fastest Test century at the Sydney Cricket Ground as the match meandered to a draw against the West Indies on Thursday.
Man-of-the-match Warner, determined to finish an undistinguished series on a high, reached his 16th Test century off 82 balls before a small Sydney crowd in the last rites to a frustrating Test. It eclipsed Matthew Hayden's 84-ball ton against Zimbabwe in 2003.

The buccaneering opener had a highest score of 64 in the two previous Tests as team-mates helped themselves to six centuries against the tourists' innocuous bowling attack.
Warner was hell-bent on rectifying that deficiency and attacked the bowling from the first ball to raise his maiden ton against the West Indies.
When the match was called off at 4:50pm local time (0550 GMT), Warner was unbeaten on 122 off 103 balls with Peter Nevill on seven and Australia 176 for two in reply to the West Indies' 330.
The match was destined to a draw after two days were washed out with only 86.2 overs possible before the anti-climatic fifth day. Skipper Steve Smith revealed after play that he had offered to contrive a result through declarations, but said that his West Indies counterpart Jason Holder declined the offer.
"Unfortunately, they didn't come to the party," Smith said. When play resumed the West Indies added 82 runs before being dismissed for 330.
Australia, and Warner in particular, went after the tourists' total with gusto to entertain the small crowd given free admission into the Sydney Cricket Ground.
Warner provided plenty of entertainment, clubbing spinner Jomel Warrican for two sixes in three balls on the way to plundering 16 runs from one over.
"We tried to go out there and be as positive as we could," Warner said. "We tried to score some runs at a nice rate to give the fans something to watch."
Warner and Joe Burns raised their 100-run stand off 92 balls, with Warner contributing 74 runs. Burns was out soon after, attempting to hoist Warrican over mid-on only to be taken head-high by Kemar Roach for 26.
Under-used Mitchell Marsh and wicketkeeper Neville were promoted in the order.
Marsh, in only his third bat of the series, was caught at slip for 21 giving spinner Jomel Warrican his fifth wicket of the series and making him his side's leading wicket-taker over the three Tests.
The West Indies earlier reached their highest score of the series before being dismissed at lunch.
It was the first time the West Indies had passed 300 in their last nine Test innings against Australia.
Spinners Nathan Lyon and Steve O'Keefe each took three wickets to finish off the first innings which had remained on hold since Monday after two days of unrelenting rain. AFP
