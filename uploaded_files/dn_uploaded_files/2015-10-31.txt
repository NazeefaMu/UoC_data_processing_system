Australian fans 'shattered' after All Blacks defeat Wallabies
Emotions and expectations were high when Wallabies and All Blacks fans gathered bright and early in pubs around Australia for the historic Rugby World Cup final.
Ahead of New Zealand's 34-17 victory, Australian supporters were full of optimism as they watched the match live on big screens as if they were at the game in Twickenham.
"Honestly I think our back three are just unbeatable when it comes to the forwards ... we've got much stronger wings and our field and centres are going to be awesome," Wallabies fan Daniel Meharg said.
But there were also New Zealand fans in Australian pubs, hoping the All Blacks could clinch back-to-back titles.
"I think the All Blacks have got greater intensity and greater strength off the bench to really take it away from the Australians in the last quarter ... so I think that's going to be the difference up until then," All Blacks fan Mike Bentley said.
"It's going to be a tight-fought match."
At the sound of the final whistle, shattered Wallabies fans contemplated what could have been.
"Obviously I'm very, very, very shattered, but the All Blacks did a great job," Wallabies supporter Tim Rogers said.
Wallabies fan Paige McLaren said the atmosphere in the pub she watched the game in was "sombre" after the game.
"It's devastating because we were in a World Cup final, but it's always hard against the All Blacks and they put up a good fight, but it's never good losing to New Zealand," she said.
New Zealand fans were jumping for joy, with their team breaking records by winning three titles and successfully defending a World Cup crown.
"One of the best games I've watched them play ... that drop goal was just astonishing ... and it's just such a great feeling to win two in a row," New Zealand supporter Richard Hobbs said.
Philip Fuaivaa, who was born and raised in New Zealand, said it was an "awesome feeling" to have his hometown win the World Cup.
"These are our heroes from childhood ... As a Kiwi would know, All Black means everything," he said.
"With the All Blacks winning, it's the best feeling ever." (abc)
