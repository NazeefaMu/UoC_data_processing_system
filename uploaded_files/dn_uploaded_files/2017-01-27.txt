Baby Fedmatures into major contender
MELBOURNE, Thursday: Despite his Baby Fed nickname and penchant for arcade games, Grigor Dimitrov could be finally maturing into a major contender as he guns for a spot in his first Grand Slam final.
The unassuming Bulgarian has spent years on the fringes of tenniss top ranks, but Dimitrov will make a name for himself if he ends Rafael Nadals magical run in the Australian Open semi-finals on Friday.
His game has long been compared to Roger Federers but while he has a similar, one-handed backhand and effortless movement, hes been lacking in one important aspect -- results.
But last year Dimitrov teamed with Daniel Vallverdu, Andy Murray and Tomas Berdychs ex-coach, and a change has been apparent at the start of this season. The 25-year-old picked up his first title since 2014 at this months Brisbane International and he is unbeaten so far this year after putting together a 10-match winning streak, matching the best of his career. He beat three top-10 players -- Kei Nishikori, Milos Raonic and Dominic Thiem -- en route to his fifth career title, with Richard Gasquet and David Goffin, the 18th and 11th seeds, among his victims in Melbourne.
Now Nadal, 30, is warily eyeing the 15th seed who stands between him and a crack at a 15th major title, three seasons and several injuries after his last.
Hes a player that has unbelievable talent, unbelievable potential. He started the season playing unbelievable, Nadal said of Dimitrov.
Its going to be a very tough match for me. I hope for him, too. Im going to try to play my best because I know hes playing with high confidence. AFP

Soul songs
The Lionel Wendt Theatre will come alive with the sounds of Gospel and Spiritual music on January 31, as Soul Sounds presentsThe Reason We Sing, conducted by Prof. Mark Wilson, Director University of California Berkeley Gospel Chorus.
This will be Prof. Wilsons fifth visit to Sri Lanka, having first accepted Soul Sounds Music Director Soundarie David Rodrigos invitation to train the group in the genre of Gospel music back in 2008. Soundarie met Prof. Wilson while completing her LL.M. at UC Berkeley when she accompanied the Universitys Gospel Chorus, which was directed by him. Having been truly inspired by this experience, she was eager to invite him to work with her own choral group, Soul Sounds.
It has been two years since Prof. Wilson visited Sri Lanka, and we are truly looking forward to learn from him again. He has inspired and taught us so much over the years and we know that our experiences of working with him are an integral part of what this group has evolved into today, especially in the genre of Gospel music, said Soundarie David Rodrigo.
Prof. Wilson hails from California and has been involved in Gospel and Spiritual music since childhood, having been exposed to it through his familys southern musical heritage. He has continued to keep this heritage alive by singing, accompanying and training numerous Gospel choirs in the US.
Speaking about his visit, Prof. Mark Wilson said, It's been almost 10 years since my first visit to Sri Lanka to share a Gospel music workshop in concert with Director Soundarie David Rodrigo and Soul Sounds. Over these years we have become more of a global family rather than international acquaintances, and have created close relationships, which will keep us united no matter how far apart we are.Our relationship represents what is really at the root of excellent choral singing.
This brings me to the theme of our concert in Colombo on January 31st, "The Reason We Sing". Musical art shared perfectly and without flaw, however beautiful and perfect it may be, lacks a deeper meaning if it is meant only to be a form of entertainment. Why do we sing and why do we sing Gospel music We sing because music, and in this case sacred music from the African-American Gospel tradition, makes us happy, stirs up good spirit and good karma within human hearts, he added.
Prof. Wilson believes that the Gospel songs from the African-American sacred music tradition featured in the concert call us to be instruments of peace, examples of unity, global ambassadors of hope and love in a world where hatred and injustice is easily stirred up. Souls Sounds, together with Prof. Wilson invite you to share in this concert, and stirup a different kind of spirit that creates unity, love, and draws us together as one.

ABC School of Early Learning celebrates 25 years
ABC School of Early Learning is celebrating 25 years in pre-school education.
The shared passion and vision of Adhirupini Tyagarajah and Ayoma Fernando brought about the birth of ABC School of Early Learning in January 1992.
Adhirupini said: My fascination for children and the desire to be with them and share my enthusiasm and creativity drove me to start this establishment with Ayoma.
When my daughter was enrolled at a preschool in Colombo and stopped going after two weeks it got me thinking.... Hence together with my friend Adhirupini the idea to start up a preschool and establish ABC School of Early Learning was mooted, said Anoma.
Surangie Munaweera joined the ABC School in 1994 and thereafter was invited to the Board and was appointed the principal of the school. From my childhood, I always played the mother role to my siblings and cousins. Where ever I went, kids would respond to me as if they've known me. I then realized I needed to pursue a career in teaching.
In its 25 year history, the ABC School has achieved much as well as facilitated many new initiatives.
The school has nurtured over 3500 children through their formative education. Today most of the children have excelled not only in the field of academics but also in sports, art and music.
The ABC School opened their first branch, the ABC Preschool on September 6, 2006.

Abductions in Colombo during 2009: ex-Navy Intelligence chief to be arrested
Lt.Commander too to be taken in:
The CID conducting investigations into an incident where several persons had been abducted by unidentified groups in Colombo and the surrounding areas in 2009 informed Court yesterday that former Navy Intelligence Director Rear Admiral Ananda Guruge is to be arrested over the disappearance of two individuals in Kotahena. The OIC of the CIDs Gang Robbery Unit-Inspector Nishantha Silva informed Court that former Navy Intelligence Director Ananda Guruge and Lieutenant Commander Sampath Dayananda, a former Navy intelligence officer attached to the Welisara Navy camp would be arrested soon regarding the investigations on the abductions and disappearances of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan and Rathnasami Paramanandan.
Meanwhile, Lieutenant Commander Dhammika Anil Mapa, a Navy Intelligence officer attached to the Welisara Navy camp arrested for allegedly abducting Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan on November 1, 2009 was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till by Colombo Additional Magistrate J. Trotsky.
Inspector Nishantha Silva informed Court that the van of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan was found at the Welisara Navy Camp while being discarded and cut into 72 pieces.
However, Presidents Counsel Anil Silva appearing for the suspect denied allegations leveled against his client but admitted the fact that the Navy Intelligence Unit had taken the concerned vehicle into their custody following a report that it contained bomb concealed and compelled to cut into pieces for the purpose of searching explosive substances.
The CID submitted to Court that there is no legal provision vested with the Navy to carry out such a step and informed Court that the Navy should have brought the matter to the attention of police and bomb disposal unit.
Meanwhile, the Additional Magistrate yesterday permitted the CID to record a statement from former Senior DIG Anura Senanayake in connection with two abductions that took place in 2009.
It is alleged the former Senior DIG covered up evidence into an incident in which two persons had been abducted by an unidentified group from the Kotahena and Wellawatte areas in 2009.
The Additional Magistrate ordered the Superintendent of the Welikada Prison  in which the former Senior DIG is being held over the killing of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen  to allow the CID access to him to record a statement.
The Colombo Crimes Division initiated investigations into these abductions on the instructions of the IGP following a complaint by then Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda in 2009.
The CID also informed the court that 11 abducted individuals had been detained at the Trincomalee underground detention centre violating their basic human rights.

While millions turned out for women marches worldwide in support of womens rights, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex and Queer (LGBTIQ) rights and many more, Sri Lanka was also at a crucial juncture and had to decide on whether to accept or deny the rights of LGBTIQ, but the Sri Lankan Cabinet recently chose to reject the attempts made to decriminalise homosexuality.
While some, including those who identify themselves as LGBTIQ argue that this government is seeking to perpetuate violence and discrimination against individuals, many others, ministers included pointed out that it was against Sri Lankan culture.
Human Rights Commission, Chairperson Deepika Udagama
Recently, a petition was created by the LGBTIQ community in Sri Lanka requesting the government to repeal laws that entrench discrimination and perpetuate violence.
They highlighted that key measures to reform and remove laws impacting LGBTIQ persons, particularly Section 365 and 365A of the Penal Code which criminalises same sex activity and continues to be used to harass and persecute LBTIQ persons, were taken out of the National Human Rights Action Plan (NHRAP) 2017-2021.
We the undersigned strongly condemn and wish to express our outrage and concern that this government is seeking to perpetuate violence and discrimination against individuals who identify as LGBTIQ, instead of taking legislative and policy actions to address systemic violence and discrimination dating from the colonial era, it stated.
However, Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission (HRC) was in favour of decriminalising homosexuality. HRC Chairperson Dr. Deepika Udagama said the attempts made to decriminalise homosexuality cannot be simply blocked on the grounds that it is culturally inappropriate. He added the countrys policies should be framed not on religious beliefs, but on common grounds.
Udagama highlighted that the HRC looks at the issue of decriminalising homosexuality from a scientific and human angle.
While Sri Lanka is proud about its history, it also has a history of obstructing progressive legislation processes pointing out cultural implications as excuses. In 2005, when the Prevention of Domestic Violence Bill was presented in Parliament, the same argument on culture came up during its debate.
In the same way, even now some say homosexuality is against our culture. However, if all segments of society are not incorporated or allowed to have their natural behaviour, that society has a serious problem, she said.
The laws pertaining to criminalisation of same sex activity were imposed on Sri Lanka during British rule and similar provisions in British law have since been repealed in other countries. Furthermore, there is no evidence to indicate that homosexual conduct was criminalised prior to colonial rule in Sri Lanka.
The LGBT community requested the government to meet national and international obligations towards the citizens of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka by ensuring that efforts are made to address discrimination and violence against LGBTIQ persons through the National Human Rights Action Plan 2017  2021, and related review processes repealing Section 365A of the Penal Code, repealing the Vagrants Ordinance and eliminating discrimination against people on sexual orientation and gender identities though constitutional reform.
In Sri Lanka, the rights of the LGBTIQ have turned out to be a matter of culture. When Daily News spoke to public to get their views on it, many of them refuse to speak with a view that it is something bad to talk about in public. Even though, LGBTIQ community made several attempts to decriminalise homosexuality, today they see that all such efforts have been in vain.
Aritha Wickramasinghe- lawyer and human rights activist
The Sri Lankan government and all parliamentarians have a duty to create a country and a society that is accepting and tolerant of all people of our country. LGBTIQ equality and decriminalization are not a cultural question. This is a human question and matter of human rights. Sri Lanka has an accepting, tolerant and compassionate culture. The culture of prejudice, violence and discrimination is not Sri Lankan culture, but it is the culture of the politicians who have constantly exploited and abused it against the people of our country. 30 years ago, they used it against Tamils, more recently the Muslims, and now the Gays! Tomorrow they will find someone else.
Women constantly suffer immense amount of discrimination and prejudice but the law protects them. So why should not the LGBTIQ people be protected from discrimination and violence as well How can you make into criminals, the people who are peaceful, caring and loving individuals because of the way they were born into this world and who they love
The National Human Rights Action Plan was first drafted by the former government. It was the Rajapaksa government that expressly included sexual orientation in their draft bill of human rights and made a public statement that discrimination against LGBTIQ people was unconstitutional.
The joint opposition never raised an issue on this; even the Defence Ministry approved the plan. If everyone else approved it, then how did a government, elected on the promise of delivering human rights and democracy for everyone, become the government to oppose it

Sarah Soysa, Founder/Director Youth Advocacy Network Sri Lanka
We in Sri Lanka are still governed by the Victorian law and in 2017, it is disappointing to see how regressive we are becoming in protecting and upholding basic human rights. In 1990, the World Health Organization declared that homosexuality was not a mental illness, and both history and science has clearly shown this to be the reality.
Having such discriminatory laws affects Sri Lanka as a whole jeopardising people's access to health, education, safety and being able to live free from violence coercion and discrimination.
Human Rights Commission, Chairperson Deepika Udagama
The HRC has been receiving many complaints lately over various threats, prejudices and attempts to arrest due to their sexual orientation. I think social dialogue and awareness on the issue are vital. The HRC has already communicated this to the Constitutional Assembly. I would suggest that the non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation should be included into the Constitution.
The draft of National Action Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 2017-2021 has not been referred to the HRC so far. Several parts of it were sent to us and we sent our observations on them. However, we are still unaware of the draft action plan presented to the Cabinet this week. It could have been better if it was referred to the Commission prior to presenting it to the Cabinet. The Commission will ask for a copy of it from the Foreign Ministry.
The Commission has a role in examining the legislation from a human rights angle and advising the government on them, but many draft policies and Bills do not reach the Commission, and we have to search out for them ourselves.
Indra Ratnayake, sales woman
Sex is a necessity, no one can deny that. A man or a woman getting attracted to their opposite sex is common. But by birth or due to biological reasons if that changes, how can they be held responsible for it Its not fair. They too have rights to lead a normal life like other people. One cannot be denied of their basic rights just because he or she is attracted to the same sex.
Kasuni Tennakkoon, student
The rights of every group is being violated every day. Being a girl, I would stand for women rights and then society would brand me as a feminist. If that is the situation for us, I can imagine how these people must be treated
N. Keerthi, private company employee
I hardly see LGBTIQ people in better positions in our country. They are often cornered to a salon or a spa. They have not been treated equally by our society, which is not right. They should also be recognised and given due respect.
Akila Weerasekara, accountant
Now we see a man and woman holding hands or under the umbrellas in the public places. Maybe in future, we will see a man and man or a woman with another woman as couples all over. I dont say that their rights should be neglected, but it is also important for us to maintain our culture.
K. Manoharan, private company employee
I am a Hindu and I see the whole thing in a totally different manner. I agree that they are being treated differently, but I fear what will happen if the government decriminalise homosexuality. I did not even know that these kinds of people existed when I was schooling, but today, children know everything. It is also a problem between rights of LGBTIQ and culture of our country. Sri Lanka is best known for its traditions and culture; sometimes this might become the beginning of us losing our culture.

The case filed against Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife was yesterday fixed for trial on May 23 by the Colombo High Court.
The Attorney General filed indictments against former Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, his wife Maureen Ranatunga and another person on the charge of threatening a businessman over the phone and demanding Rs. 64 million.
Meanwhile, High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke yesterday permitted two accused to go abroad from the first week of February.
At a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court decided to proceed the trial against Ranatunga and his wife in absentia of third accused Naresh Kumar Fareek who was evading Courts since the beginning of investigations.
Ranatunga and his wife are currently out on bail.
The Attorney General filed indictments on 15 counts against three accused Prasanna Ranatunga, Maureen Ranatunga and Naresh Kumar Fareek based on charges of committing offences during the period between April 6, 2015 and June 2, 2015.
In addition, the Attorney General has named 65 witnesses and included 35 articles as Courts productions against three accused in this case.
The prosecutors maintained that businessman Gehard Mendis who purchased a 2.5 acre land in Meethotamulla sometime back had allegedly requested the former Chief Minister to evacuate the unlawful occupants of that land and fill it with soil. The prosecutors alleged that the former Chief Ministers wife along with two others had entered into an agreement with the businessman and the latter had already paid Rs.15 million to the former for the services.
Mendis lodged a complaint with FCID saying that the former Chief Minister had threatened him over the phone demanding the rest of the money involved in a promised deal.
The prosecution maintained that the investigations have revealed that the accused had misappropriated Rs.15 million and the voice recordings of the alleged incident had been listed as a production item.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General. President's Counsel Anil Silva appeared for the accused.

China says Hambantota industrial zone not only for Chinese

China has not asked Sri Lanka to restrict the Hambantota industrial zone to Chinese companies, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said today.
Let me be very clear, - China has never asked Sri Lanka to allow only Chinese enterprises to operate in the Hambantota industrial zone, she said, She added the recent protests in Hambantota were because people did not understand the policies negotiated between the Chinese and Sri Lankan governments.
The Foreign Ministry spokesperson also said China had not forced Sri Lanka - which owes China a massive USD 8 billion - to offer concessions on the port project.
The Chinese enterprises have always discussed the Hambantota Port project with the Sri Lankan side on a voluntary basis, in the spirit of equality and mutual benefit, and following market rules, she said.
As the two countries are friendly neighbors, China is willing to provide the best assistance to help Sri Lanka with its economic development, to achieve common development.
This is in the interests of both countries.

A plea to clean up SriLankan airlines
I was astonished and baffled to hear the public enterprise Minister Kabir Hashim's recent statement of his disappointment for not being able to clean up SriLankan airlines and bring offenders to book even though a strong Yahapalanaya, good governance government is in existence. He has said that there is a mafia within the Sri Lankan airlines and it still exists.
His confession shows us he confronts challenges and difficulties in cleaning up the airlines.
The Weliamuna report apparently says the former Chairman Nishantha Wickramasinghe was allegedly involved of financial misappropriation in the airlines. But it surprises us how the current chairman Ajith Dias has dismissed the Weliamuna report saying there is no problem with the airline. It is vividly clear and evident the national carrier the SLA has been continuously on loss since the previous regime in power and it has been investigated by the FCID that massive fraud has taken place.
At such a scenario how could the current chairman vindicate the fraudulent and corrupted officials in the airlines who still exist in service who were illegally manipulated by the Rajapaksa clan.
Hence, I very earnestly request the President and the Prime Minister to take immediate action to bring all the culprits to book or empower the Minister Kabir Hashim to do so.

Court calls for medical report on Duminda Silva
Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala yesterday ordered the Superintendent of Welikada Prison that a medical report pertaining to the health condition of former MP Duminda Silva be obtained from a neurologist attached to the Colombo National Hospital.
The former Parliamentarian was not brought before Court yesterday by prison authorities over three corruption cases filed by the Bribery Commission.
At a previous occasion, Prison officials informed Court that Silva was not healthy to be brought before open Court even by a wheelchair.
Accordingly, further magisterial inquiry was fixed for February 13.
Submitting a report pertaining to the health condition of Silva, the Chief Medical Officer of Prison Hospital informed Court that Neurosurgeon of Mount Elisabeth Hospital in Singapore had highly recommended that Silva should be kept in an absolutely hygienic environment, kept in a magnet less field and stress less condition.
On January 5, Silva was brought to the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court premises in an ambulance by prison authorities.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the former Parliamentarian had failed to declare his assets and liabilities in accordance with the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No.1 of 1975, for a period of three years since 2011 to 2013.
Silva was sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court for committing the murder of four people including former MP Bharatha Premachandra and he is serving a sentence of imprisonment at the Welikada Prison.
On September 8, 2016, former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Duminda Silva was sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court for committing the murder of four persons including Premachandra on October 8, 2011.
At a previous occasion, the defence counsel appearing for the former MP informed Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala that his client was willing to plead guilty if the court would impose only a fine.
The Bribery Commission officials told Court that according to Assets and Liabilities Law, the Court has jurisdiction to impose a fine of Rs. 1,000 with one year jail term for a person who found guilty to the charges.
Subsequently, the defence counsel informed Court that his client was not pleading guilty to the charges and moved for a trial.
Assistant Legal Director of Bribery Commission Thushari Dayaratne appeared on behalf of the prosecution. Defence counsel Anuja Premaratne appeared for the accused.
In theses cases, the Bribery Commission had named the Deputy Secretary General of Parliament P.M.Neil Parakrama and several others as witnesses.

Crysbro Group provides pure drinking  water to war heroes in unique CSR
Crysbro Group the poultry producer in Sri Lanka with ISO 14001,environment safety certification, British Consortium Certification, ISO 9001, ISO 22000, HACCP, BRC and Halal certifications has intervened in an unprecedented project to provide pure drinking water to Sri Lanka war heroes at the Army Rifle Corps Camp, Atabage Kothmale.
This was to show sheer gratitude to the Army personnel's quick response and heroic maneuver to douse the hazardous fire in the jungle close to their Modern Processing Plant which was spreading dangerously towards the Plant. At this point of time the management of Crysbro Group had sent an urgent SOS request seeking help from the SL Army Rifle Corps, Atabage Camp to douse the fire. Swiftly responding to urgent request of Cryspro a team from the Atabage Camp had rushed to the vicinity of the bushfire and brought it under control in an effective and efficient manner preventing any injury of loss .
As a mark of appreciation to the heroic task of the Army personnel of the, Atabage Camp and to showcase Crysbro Groups heartiest gratitude, the Chairman / MD and Group Human Resources Manager had personally visited the camp and met the Commanding Officer (CO), Major Manoj Weerawardhana and other relevant Officers who were instrumental in the great endeavor of dousing the very perilous forest fire.
During the discussion, it was revealed that the camp which consisted over 350 personnel was suffering from an acute pure drinking water shortage problem. The camp used to source water for their needs from a water stream close to the camp. But due to the lack of resources the camp had been unable to get the water purified up to excepted hygienic standards which related to Army personnel falling ill by drinking the water. The Crysbro Management considering the poor plight of the water situation in the camp had then decided to embark on the unique task of providing the camp with a fully fledged water treatment, filter project. The Crysbro Management was even to its commitment completing the project in one month and handing over the cutting edge water treatment filtering plant to the camp's Commanding Officer Major Manoj Weerawardhana.
The handing over ceremony took place in the presence of Senior Officials from Crysbro and all Senior Officers of the camp.
Commanding Officer Major Manoj Weerawardhana expressing his sincere appreciation and gratitude on behalf of all the personnel of the Army Rifle Corps Camp, Atabage said, "Pure drinking water has been a serious problem for a long time in this camp. There were incidents where many soldiers had to be hospitalized due to contacting hepatitis after consuming water. We are very happy to have a highly technical water filtering plant for us which was donated by Crysbro."
Commanding Officer Major Manoj Weerawardhana and his team also handed over a Token of Appreciation to Crysbo representatives.

Dole Lanka terminates unethical  contractor, Southern Force
Dole Lanka,a subsidiary of Dole Asia Holdings, the world's largest producers and marketers of fresh fruits and vegetables,has terminated the contract with one of their labour outsourcing companies, Southern Force Ltd.
The decision was primarily made upon an inquiry that revealed that Southern Force had not made the EPF and ETF payments of their contracted labourers for many years although they had collected the same from Dole Lanka.
The inquiry was triggered when Southern Force showed reluctance to renew their contract with new conditions which demanded transparency in statutory payment records.
Furthermore several contract employees had made complaints that their statutory payments had been withheld by the Southern Force.
In this connection the Labour Department had filed two cases against Southern Force with the Wellawaya Magistrate's Court, in which they had admitted guilt and agreed on monthly payments to court in relation to unpaid EPF and ETF funds. Further investigations by Dole Lanka have revealed that the unpaid EPF and ETF payments by Southern Force over the years amounts to Rs 15 mn.Southern Force (Pvt) Ltd has not paid Value Added Tax (VAT) amounting to Rs 25 mn which was collected from Dole Lanka (Pvt) Ltd.
As a result, in keeping with best ethical practices, their international code of conduct and the labour laws of Sri Lanka, Dole Lanka was compelled to terminate their contract with Southern Force. However recognizing the valuable contribution made by the contracted labourers over the years and Dole Lanka's aspiration to empower the rural communities of Sri Lanka, the company has assured continuous employment for all labourers contracted through Southern Force via one of their other labour outsourcing companies.Over the years this company has been proven to be reliable in their dealings with Dole Lanka. This company also has a workforce of over 6000 people in different manufacturing & production organizations.
When inquired whether the employees would be impacted by a break in continuous employment due to the switch Dole Lanka Human Resources Head E. Abeywickrama said they have taken all necessary measures to draw the agreement with the new labour outsourcing company on the same day the previous contract with the Southern Force was terminated.
"This is to ensure that the gratuity and other statutory payments of the employees will be considered since the inception of service, with no break in continuous employment. He further stressed that critical measures have been made to reaffirm the job security of all their employees, contract or otherwise in line with the company's vision.
Dole Lanka is a subsidiary of Dole Asia Holdings Founded in Hawaii in 1851.Dole Asia Holdings is owned by Itochu Corporation.
Dole is one of the world's largest producers and marketers of high-quality fresh fruit and fresh vegetables with revenues of $7.5 billion. The company does business in more than 70 countries and employs, on average, 20,000 full-time, regular employees and 7,000 full-time seasonal or temporary employees, worldwide.

Dutch justice minister resigns amid drug trafficker payment row

Dutch Justice Minister Ard van der Steur has resigned in a row over a 2001 compensation payment to a convicted drug trafficker.
The Ministers departure is regarded as a blow to the government of Prime Minister Mark Rutte.
Prime Minister Ruttes centre-right Liberal Party (VVD) is trailing in opinion polls ahead of a general election in March.
Van de Steur is the third member of Rutte's government to resign over the scandal.
Former Justice Minister Ivo Opstelten and his junior minister, Fred Teeven, resigned in 2015 after misleading parliament over the 2001 deal.
The affair revolves around a deal prosecutors reached with a drug trafficker, Cees Helman, worth 2m (1.7m; $2.1m).
Van de Steur has been criticised for his role in answers provided to parliament over the issue.
The Justice Minister has denied advising certain information be withheld.
Prime Minister Rutte has also come under fire from opposition politicians.
The Freedom Party, led by anti-immigration politician Geert Wilders, is leading public opinion polls.

## Title: Empowering the estate community

Empowering the estate community
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that the government was planning to provide a seven perch land plot to each estate family. This is with a view to settling this community in the same estate environment they have been living for generations, performing their labour. The estate workers, sad to say, are still confined to their hovel like line rooms from the times of their colonial masters. More often than not, large families live in cramped conditions, confined to a few square feet, with nothing to call as garden space. Hence this indeed is a welcome move that would give these toiling workers some breathing space.
The Premier also said, steps are also underway to improve the education standards of the plantation youth and science teaching facilities would be upgraded to the students in the estate schools since they don't have access to science subjects. Addressing the fourth Ministerial Consultation of the Abu Dhabi Dialogue in Colombo the Premier said the government wants to motivate youth in the estate sector to move out from the estates and look for other jobs.
Premier Wickremesinghe is perhaps the first Lankan leader who spoke on the need for upward mobility of the estate youth by breaking out of their cloistered and drab existence. He may perhaps not have won many friends among the plantation sector politicians for his forthright views. These politicians have been able to hoodwink the estate community all these years primarily due to the ignorance and backwardness of their community. The estate community has long been taken for granted by these politicians who know very well that their humble brethren could be fooled easily with empty rhetoric. Any moves to enlighten them by imparting an education, no doubt would be frowned by these politicians. What they desire is to keep their minions in unenlightened darkness, lest they get wise to their crafty machinations.
The estate workers down the years have been an exploited lot, both by the British colonialists and the brown sahibs that took their place. They took good care to ensure that these pathetic souls remain tied to the estates and thus remain in perennial bondage. They feared any type of exposure to the outside world, lest this gave them ideas.
This was the same modus operandi pursued by plantation sector politicians of the post Independence era. Exploiting their ignorance and poverty, these politicians portrayed themselves as Messiahs who had come to deliver their community out of their predicament. In this way they were able to hold the estate community to ransom and what is more, as bargaining chips during national elections. The community was sold to the highest bidder, so to speak. These wretched souls were virtually kept in thrall of their political masters and what is interesting is they were ready to be the willing tools of the machinations of these politicians - all because they were uninitiated and kept in the dark.
The Messiahs of the Thottams of course thrived on the ignorance of this segment of our community who worked their hands raw day in day out to keep the wheels of the economy running. They exploited the workers to acquire ministerial office, under all regimes, always justifying their treacherous actions to ensuring the welfare of their community whereas in actual fact the power of office was used for self advancement and other indulgences, all at the expense of the ignorance of their charges.
It is time that the estate community were delivered out of their bondage and redeemed from their present status as supplicants. All the opportunities should be made available for their emancipation from the state of a backward and exploited community. They should be allowed to live with dignity and self respect, banishing altogether the public image of them as serfs and vassals. It is a fact that the estate community had all along lived in isolation, cut off from the mainstream activity. They have been living largely shunned and unsung quite in contrast to their contribution to the country's economy.
Only during an election that the estate community comes into the equation for their bloc vote sought by the main political parties. This fact is exploited by the estate politicians for personnel gain. Little or no efforts have been made to uplift their lives by these politicians who dish out the votes for lucrative returns. Hence the estate workers have been condemned to live like pawns of the politicians.
The Government's plans to uplift the lives of this community who are inextricably linked to the country's economy should therefore be appreciated. The estate workers, particularly the youth, should be made to think out of the box. There certainly are talented, industrious material in the estates who have fallen by the wayside due to lack of opportunity. We hardly hear of doctors or engineers being produced by the estates, unlike their counterparts in the North. The government's measures to provide the necessary wherewithal to the estate community to stand up on their feet, it is hoped, would come to fruition, undoing the shackles that has placed them in bondage all these years.

Although several ministers and MPs in the government were billed to participate in todays Joint Opposition rally at Nugegoda, they have been asked to keep away from attending the rally temporarily, Kandy District Parliamentarian Keheliya Rambukwella said.
However, all parliamentarians in the Joint Opposition will be attending the rally, he said. Rambukwella said it was regrettable to see the government which professed super democracy obstructing its members from joining the Joint Opposition group. Rambukwella said holding rallies, protest campaigns, press conferences and participating in political debates was a prime duty and role of an Opposition.
The UNP had to languish in the Opposition benches for nearly 20 years because it failed to perform this role while in the Opposition. He said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Parliamentarians Chamal Rajapaksa, Vidura Wickremenayake would definitely attend todays rally.
The LSSP and other Parliamentarians in the Joint Opposition would also attend the rally.
Basil Rajapaksa will not be attending the Nugegoda rally, he said.

Federer, Williamses set up finals for the ages
MELBOURNE, Thursday: Roger Federer survived an all-Swiss thriller to push his incredible run all the way to the Australian Open final on Thursday, as Serena and Venus Williams clinched a dream womens decider.
Federer was taken to five sets by a belligerent Stan Wawrinka before he pounced for a 7-5, 6-3, 1-6, 4-6, 6-3 victory to reach his first Grand Slam final since the 2015 US Open.
It makes Federer, 35, the oldest major finalist since a 39-year-old Ken Rosewall at the 1974 US Open, with his long-time rival Rafael Nadal or Grigor Dimitrov awaiting on Sunday.
Federer wasnt the only one to turn back the clock as Serena and Venus Williams, aged 35 and 36 respectively, set up their first major final together in eight years.
Mirjana Lucic-Baroni and Coco Vandeweghe were the semi-final victims as the jubilant sisters went into their ninth Grand Slam title match.
The womens semi-finals had the highest average age in Open-era history, and the mens tournament is also a blast from yesteryear after the exits of Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, the top two seeds.
Federer, back from a six-month injury break, took full advantage as he weathered a fightback from fourth-ranked Wawrinka, who destroyed a racquet and took a medical time-out along the way.
It feels amazing, Federer said. I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would be going to be coming this far here... its beautiful, Im so happy. Federer now has a golden opportunity to add to his record 17 major titles and potentially gain revenge against Nadal, who has won the last four of their eight Slam finals.
While the Williams sisters marched on, it was at the expense of brave Croatian Lucic-Baroni, whose astounding Grand Slam comeback was halted by Serena.
Lucic-Baroni, 34, took a selfie on court and blew kisses to her fans after her first Grand Slam semi-final in 18 years ended in a 50-minute, 6-2, 6-1 defeat.
The 79th-ranked former teenage prodigy disappeared from the scene after fleeing her abusive father but she has tenaciously clawed her back to the very highest levels.
Im proud of myself. I had an incredible two weeks, singles, doubles. I played semi-finals of singles, quarters of doubles. I would sign for that every time, for sure, said the Croatian.
Americas Vandeweghe, who was also unseeded, was bitterly disappointed as she blew a one-set lead against Venus to lose 6-7 (3/7), 6-2, 6-3.
Straight after the match I was pretty upset. I had a feel-sorry-for myself moment, the 25-year-old said, calling her loss from one set up a missed opportunity.
But what made me feel a lot better was when my team came over when I was in the gym sitting by myself, they came over, gave me a big hug. AFP

The International Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) as B+ Outlook Negative. The Bank has been obtaining ratings from Fitch Rating Lanka Ltd since 2000 and has been gradually improving since it obtained its National Long-Term Rating as AA+ (lka).
Fitch also considered the countrys operation environment as a key rating driver for the banking sector when considering IDR, where it is unlikely that such would be assigned above the sovereign rating.
The IDRs and the National Long-Term Ratings of the Bank reflect the sovereign support and Fitch further states that it expects support for BOC to stem from its high systematic importance, quasi-sovereign status, role as key lenders to the Government and full state ownership.

The Petitioner further stated that in any event the continuous reliance or circulation or actions of the said COPE report as it presently stands amounts to a continuing infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka,and also amounts to a cause which enables the Petitioner to prefer this application in the public interest.
The Petitioner pleads that through the said COPE report, the Petitioner and the general public have been misinformed and misled.
The Petitioner said that in the event that the CBSL was not properly or officially or lawfully issuing Treasury Bonds viz the direct/private placement from the month of January 2009,the proper procedure that ought to have been followed from January 2009 was the Central Bank Treasury Bond auction process.
The Petitioner further stated that instead of reporting the above to Parliament and the general public, the said COPE report is littered with inconsistencies or contradictions or misrepresentations, which the Petitioner pleads makes certain findings and statements in the COPE report unsafe, or prejudiced or biased, and a violation/ infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka.
The Petitioner and the general public of Sri Lanka are entitled to receive a fair, impartial and truthful investigation into such matters, which is free from bias and ulterior/political objectives. 65.
The Petitioner states that by the glaring contradictions and/or inconsistencies and/or misrepresentations contained in the said COPE report, the members of the COPE committee [i.e. the 1st to 26th Respondents] have not fulfilled their duties and obligations to the Petitioner [and other members of the general public of Sri Lanka].
The petitioner is seeking an Order or Declare that any express or implied finding and statement and suggestion in the said COPE report that the direct/private placement method in the issue of Treasury Bonds by the Central Bank has been properly, lawfully and correctly used by the Central Bank from the month of January 2009 up until the date of the COPE report, is wrongful.
The petitioner is further seeking an Order or Declare that as at the time of the Treasury Bond auctions of the Central Bank that was held on 27 February 2015 and 29 March 2016, the proper, lawful process or method as regards the issue of Treasury Bonds was the auction process/method, and not the direct/private placement process/method.

George Steuart Health  introduces revolutionary invention against dust  mite allergies to SL
George Steuart Health, the leading pharmaceutical solutions provider in Sri Lanka has yet again proved their aspiration to deliver the finest medical care to their customers across the island by introducing Allergoff- an allergen neutralizing spray which helps treat symptoms of house dust allergens related allergies.
The innovative formula used for this revolutionary product introduced by ICB Pharma Poland, helps relieve symptoms of house dust allergies and asthma and prevents disease progression while offering additional protection against contraction of allergies for both children and adults.
Designed to reduce exposure to allergens present in house dust, Allergoff has a dual action whereby it neutralizes the pathogenic effect of the allergen and reduces risk of inhalation by binding dust particles and lowering concentrations of allergens in inhaled air.
Studies conducted by Prof. Neelika Malavige attached to the Faculty of Medical Sciences of the Sri Jayewardenepura University, show that the house dust-mite is liable for about 80% of asthma and allergic rhinitis patients and about 30% of patients are allergic to indoor mold.
Allergoff, the breakthrough solution in house allergy management, has been voted Product of the Year for two consecutive years and Discovery 2013 (Poland).

Goad now in our hands: Dilan
We have taken the elephant goad into our hands, SLFP Media Spokesperson Dilan Perera said yesterday, as he insisted that they would not be silent partners in the unity government.
We are with the government, just because there are problems,
we cannot let the goad go. When there is something bad we criticise and if there is something good, we appreciate that,,Perera said. He was speaking at a media conference at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
The state minister also took the opportunity to hit out at members of the Joint Opposition who criticised the SLFP members within the government for having no control. Earlier they said we did nothing inside the unity government and that the elephant had run riot. But now the goad is in our hands; it is with the President and now they say that the President is controlling everything, he said.
And it is because we have the goad that we did not allow lottery ticket prices to be increased, for Hambantota to be sold, for local government elections to be held under the old system and we will not let the perpetrators of the bond scam go, added the state minister. The Joint Opposition in the meantime will hold its anti-government rally today (27) and while the former President, Mahinda Rajapaksa is expected to attend, he has asked that the other SLFP ministers refrain from attending it. We have not been invited but they are all SLFP members and they are free to have such rallies. They have been having such rallies throughout but that has not had an impact on the government, Perera said.

The President and the Prime Minister are focusing on the wrong issue, the bond issue, without telling the truth to the country about the proposed new Constitution and stopping the Joint opposition from misleading the public, Nava Sama Samaja Party (NSSP) Leader Dr. Wickramabahu Karunaratne said.
Addressing a press conference at the party office in Colombo yesterday, he said two years had passed without nothing been done for a new constitution.
"Only public opinion is collected. There is nothing about the devolution of power or whether the country is a unitary state or not. However, the former President's gang shouts from the top of the roof telling that the new Constitution is a death trap," Karunaratne said.
He said the JVP was now not telling the government what should and not be done.
"They are trying to take political advantage using the existing situation in the country," Karunaratne said.

Green light on green tea
When it comes to hot drinks, most of us know that green tea is a healthier alternative to breakfast tea with two sugars, or a cup of coffee.
But a new video has revealed just how many health benefits you gain from drinking this fragrant brew.
From weight loss to ridding you of wrinkles, these are the seven benefits you could see if you drink green tea regularly.
WEIGHT LOSS
From weight loss to ridding you of wrinkles, these are the seven benefits you could see if you drink green tea regularly
It's the polyphenol in green tea which is said to help you slim, as they are reported to help speed up your metabolism, allowing your body to burn off more energy from the food you eat.
DE-STRESS TOOL
Drinking green tea can help to you to relax and rid you of any anxieties, it's said. The theanines in green tea can reduce the symptoms of anxiety, some studies have suggested.
CANCER FIGHTER
Green tea is packed full of antioxidants, and some early studies suggest that it could even help prevent people from getting cancer, though there's not enough evidence yet for this to be conclusive.
People with cancer often opt to drink green tea because they believe it might boost their immune system, improve their health, and get rid of toxins in the body, according to Cancer Research.
REDUCES CHOLESTEROL
Drinking several cups of green tea a day is said to significantly reduce levels of 'unhealthy' cholesterol
Drinking several cups of green tea a day is said to significantly reduce levels of 'unhealthy' cholesterol. A review of 11 studies involving 821 people found daily consumption of green and black tea (as a drink or a capsule) could help lower cholesterol and blood pressure thanks to tea and its catechins, according to the NHS.
These trials were only short-term but it points to cholesterol-reducing benefits.
HEALTHY TEETH AND GUMS
Drinking green tea could even help boost your oral hygiene as it has plenty of anti-inflammatory benefits which could prevent gum disease. A study that examined the dental health of 940 men found that those who regularly drank green tea had better oral health than those who didn't.
HELPS DIGESTION
Drinking lots of green tea could help digestion due to its high levels of antioxidants, it's thought.
And a study by the Cincinnati College of Medicine found that drinking green tea could help with the symptoms of colitis and Crohn's Disease.
ANTI-AGING
It's the antioxidants again in green tea that could help rid you of wrinkles, it's thought.
Antioxidants help to stop free radicals from breaking down collagen in our skin, which is the protein that keeps us looking young. -Daily Mail.UK

Hambantota mega port project  to receive Rs.165 bn in FDI
Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) will receive an inflow of US$ 1.1 billion (Rs.165 billion) Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) with the conclusion of the negotiations and the signing of the final agreements, for the Hambantota Harbour this year.
The receipt of US$ 1.1billion will help improve the countrys Balance of Payments (BOP) position as this will be an inflow to the financial account of the BOP. The major advantage of this inflow is its non-debt creating nature, which is particularly beneficial to the country.It will be added to the countrys external reserves thereby strengthening the external position of the country.
The increased foreign exchange reserves will help in providing greater stability to the exchange rate as well, a Development Strategies and International Trade Ministry release said.With this investment the government will have a number of alternative options in the way of utilising the foreign inflows of US$ 1.1billion (about Rs. 165 billion). One was is the utilising the funds to repay expensive foreign loans thereby reducing the interest expenditure and future debt burden of the country.
The second is the utilising the funds for financing the budget deficit in 2017. (If selected, this option will effectively reduce the domestic borrowing requirement of the government budget for this year helping to maintain lower domestic market interest rates.
Utilising the funds for liability management purposes i.e. switching to longer maturities to reduce bunching of debt service payments in another option. In a bid to take maximum use of the Prot a Framework Agreement has been signed between SLPA and China Merchants Ports Holding Company (CMPCH).
Under the initial proposal, 80% stake to state-owned CMPCH and 20% to SLPA has been proposed. Accordingly, negotiations are going on for the final terms and conditions, which will be agreed upon a mutually beneficial basis to both parties. The government has assured that under no circumstance, will Sri Lankas stake be less than 20%. Hambantota port development project Phase I commenced in 2008 and it became operational in November 2010.
Phase II of the project commenced in November 2012 and at present, it has been completed substantially at a cost at US$ 808 million. Once completed, the Hambantota port will occupy an area of 1,815 hectares and, according to the Master Plan, it will have the capacity to accommodate 33 vessels at a time.
Once it is fully operational, it will be the worlds largest port, built on land and will be able to handle up to 05 million TEUs per annum.
The port saves three days of sailing time and fuel for the ships, which are otherwise compelled to divert to the port of Colombo. Around 200 to 300 ships sail through this route daily. Hambantota port is strategically positioned in terms of domestic trade perspectives also.
However since the commencement of the commercial operations of the phase I in 2010, the performance of Hambantota port has not been satisfactory as it has incurred substantial losses. Meanwhile, the annual debt service payments, which are currently made by SLPA, amounted to about US$ 73 million (Rs. 10.6 billion) in 2016.
This situation has seriously threatened the financial viability of the project. In fact, SLPA is compelled to divest a significant portion of its revenue to repay the debt incurred from the construction and loss-making operations of the Hambantota port. Making things worse, it is running at severe under-capacity at present.
The completion of the remaining work needs a substantial amount of further investment. In this context, the infusion of further capital to complete the project, by way of loans virtually does not exist given the already weak public finances of the country and the need for resolving the issues related to the Rs. 9,500 billion debt burden of the country. The government and SLPA has the responsibility of making debt service payments as well as bearing the losses of the Hambantota port.The project is expected to be complemented by railway and highway networks, an oil refinery and associated facilities as well. The government expects to develop the Hambantota port with industrial zones in the area. In this context, Chinese investors have already expressed the willingness to invest in Sri Lanka.
It is extremely important to understand that entering in to a Concession Agreement to develop the Hambantota port is not a new initiative by this government.
In fact, SLPA (as per the Act No. 51 (Section 7-1 (a)), did sign a Supply, Operate and Transfer (SOT) contract in 2014 related to the Hambantota port for a joint venture with the Chinese.

Harry Potter character crabs
Potterheads, take note! An underwater crab species has been named after Harry Potter and Severus Snape - characters from the British writer J K Rowlings popular fantasy novel series.
The new species and genus of crab, Harryplax severus, also honours researcher Harry Conley, who had collected the crab specimen about two decades ago. Having dug as deep as 30 metres into coral reef rubble in the island of Guam in the western Pacific Ocean, Conley collected many specimens.
Among the lot, were two unusual specimens which were not studied until much later. Only recently, researchers from the National University of Singapore discovered that they represent not only a new species, but also a new genus.
Having chosen the name Harryplax for the new genus, researchers paid tribute to Conley.
The name is also meant to allude to the main protagonist in Rowlings famous fantasy novel series, whose magical abilities the scientists liken to Conleys knack for finding rare or new species. The crabs species name, severus, is inspired by another character from the wizarding world - Professor Severus Snape, who despite being a central character in the series, keeps his background and agenda mysterious until the very end.
Showing his real identity, the character is just like the present new species which has eluded discovery until now, nearly 20 years after it was first collected, researchers said. The new species is a tiny crab measuring less than a centimeter in both length and width and can be found deep in coral rubble or under subtidal rocks, perhaps also in cavities.
To survive in the dark depths, the species has evolved with reduced eyes, well developed antennae, and long, slender legs. For the time being it is known only from the island of Guam.

Hiring of SLTB buses by MR for Presidential poll: SLTB asked to file counter objections
The Colombo Commercial High Court yesterday directed the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) to file counter objections before March 28 against the preliminary objections raised by several defendants including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in connection with defaulting Rs. 142 million owed to the SLTB, whose buses were used to transport people to election rallies of the former President during the 2015-Presidential Election campaign.
The defendants had filed preliminary objections against the amended plaint filed by the SLTB. On a previous occasion the SLTB had decided to exclude Minister Susil Premajayantha and Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa from the defendant list.
When the case came up before Commercial High Court Shiran Gunaratne, the matter was fixed for counter objections on March 28.
According to the amended plaint SLTB has named five UPFA 20015 - Presidential election committee members, including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), election committee members Gamini Senarath and Amal Senadhilankara as respondents.
The SLTB had earlier named seven parties including SLFP former General Secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha as defendants.
The plaintiff said the UPFA had hired buses from the SLTB for the January 8th Presidential Election rallies but had failed to settle the payments after obtaining the services.

The Provincial Education Director said he was aware of the problem and would take immediate action to intervene and solve the problem.

Just In Time Group Christmas Wish Charity  Project helps Childrens Home
Just In Time Group commenced on a Christmas Wish Project for Lucia Perotti Childrens Home situated in Welihena, a small town located on the outskirts of Negombo.
Their needs were simple, Bed sheets with pillow cases, food rations and sanitary items. But we wanted to do a bit more to bring extra joy to the children the Home lacked a TV and we installed a brand new 42 inch TV for the childrens activity room.
The staff of Just In Time Group also contributed in order to give individual gift bags filled with accessories and stationery to brighten their day.
Lucia Perotti Childrens home is a special one, which is managed by Missionary Sister Pushpa who is the main care taker along with six other missionary sisters who have dedicated their lives solely to help children in need of assistance in facing their daily lives through the struggles they face.
It becomes special because of the children who reside here, young girls from the ages 4-16 years who have been saved from extremely troubled backgrounds, experiences and struggles such as, extreme poverty, imprisonment of parents, ethical conflicts, abandonment and abuse to name a few.
For this reason photos of these children are not allowed to be published to the public in order maintain their anonymity.
The primary goal of the home is to provide a comfortable place to live and conditions favouring schooling for the children who have no adequate parental protection, guidance or hope for the future.
Working to create a better and brighter future for our countrys youth is a cause Just In Time staff are very passionate about. Additionally to our Christmas Wish Project, Just in Time Group has already launched and running its CSR programme Today a Reader Tomorrow a Leader  which inculcates the habit of reading in children across the island, thereby playing our part in empowering our future generation.
Just In Time Group a wholly Sri Lankan company has been a key partner and implementer of several cutting edge mission critical ICT projects in the country over the last two decades. With the dawn of 2016, Just In Time Group completed a two decade 20 years mammoth journey in the ICT arena of Sri Lanka.
This growth throughout the years is a vital milestone with their longstanding strategic partnerships with principals, customers and employees.

Justice is paramount
Last week we witnessed the campaigns of various democratic organisations against disappearances and human rights violations. What happened to Wickrematunge, Prageeth Eknaligoda, Thajudeen and Raviraj attracted attention to the issue of disappearances too. Enforced disappearance is a crime without end. Until parents, wives, siblings, and children know the truth about the fate of a missing family member, they can find it almost impossible to seek justice and reparation. This is the time for all communities to shed tears for these violations of humanistic principles.
All those who came felt they have suffered, and cannot properly mourn their loss. Of these tragedies, Enforced Disappearance has touched every community. Within Lanka there has been virtually no accountability for these grievous crimes, except the general acceptance that these humans were victims of two civil wars. Firstly there was the repression against Sinhala racists that opposed granting power to Tamil people; Secondly the war against Tamil liberation movement. With a backlog of over 100,000 alleged enforced disappearances since the late 1980s, there is no shortage of examples of frustrated justice.
Women seeking accountability
Naturally, family members of the disappeared continue to demand accountability. Their tireless campaign illustrates the impact of these crimes and show the burden placed on those - particularly women  seeking accountability. The lengths to which some families have gone to get attention to their demands are unbelievable. They marched braving very serious threats of retaliation for their activism. Families of the disappeared know what they want and what they need.
It is up to Lankan decision makers to hear their demands and to implement them. Of course some things are impossible. But what happened, where and why should be clear in each case. If Lanka wants to negate its violent past, policymakers must prioritize victims, so they take their rightful place at the centre of the march to future. It should act to criminalize enforced disappearances under Lankan law, and act decisively to protect those who make complaints.
In this scenario Opposition Leader R Sampanthan accused the United National Party (UNP) of working with the Joint Opposition and preventing corrupt officials from being jailed. Some accused, TNA leader appears to be more interested in the corruption in the country than disappearances or the multiple problems the Tamils suffer in their Homeland. They ask, are not the Tamil sufferings important enough to be raised up in the parliament
Has Sampanthan designated the Tamils as a defeated nation On the contrary Sampanthan consolidated his power among the Sinhala masses by speaking as a Lankan leader. He would be in a better position now, to raise Tamil self determination now. Speaking in Parliament, Sampanthan said that no one from the opposition has yet been convicted or jailed for corruption. Here he refers to the racist fascistic opposition. He said that some members of the current Government are also corrupt and they must be charged.
Valuable contribution
Sampanthan says the public are fed up of the behaviour of the Government and the Joint Opposition. This is a valuable contribution from the leader of the opposition. Certainly he will be in a better position to fight for the self determination of Tamils.
The new constitution that is being created provides an opportunity to resolve the decades old nationality conflict in the island; that must not be wasted as many such opportunities have been in the past. The constitution must recognize the right of Tamils to self-governance, including in areas of land, and police. The recognition of the North and East of the island as historically the homeland of the Tamils must be preserved, as denoted in the 1987 Indo-Lanka Accord.
The solution to the Tamil national problem must be found through adoption of a new constitution, rejecting marginal reforms through constitutional amendments. The mandate given to the TNA by the Tamils in the North and East to seek a political solution providing for self-governance in a unified Northeast must be seriously considered.
Prevention of Terrorism Act
In addition, there are few urgent actions to complete the democratic landscape. Repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act immediately. Abolish torture at detention facilities. Release all detainees held under PTA.
Release all land appropriated by the military in the former war zones to civilians. Provide resettlement and rehabilitation assistance through civilian authorities. As in other districts, keep only one army camp in districts in Tamil homeland too. Take steps to develop Tamil speaking regiment in the Lankan army. The practice of the Sinhala military engaging in civilian activities in the Tamil areas must cease. The justice mechanisms for war crimes or crimes against humanity must consist of a combined structure with judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators from all three communities Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim.

Lankas highest foreign debt repayment of   US$ 4,000 mn due in 2019
The total debt stock of Sri Lanka has gone up by 233% to Rs.7, 391 billion during the period from 2005 to 2014, the Finance Ministry said yesterday.
The total debt burden of Sri Lanka in 2005 was Rs.2, 222 billion and, within 5 years, it increased up to Rs.4, 590 billion in 2010. In addition there is another Rs 2,000 billion debt obtained by the Public owned Enterprises directly off the balance sheet.
Accordingly, the debt servicing (loan installments and the interest) to be paid by Sri Lanka to foreign financiers is also increasing constantly. The debt servicing of US$ 1,828 million paid in 2016 will be increased by more than double to US$ 3,992 million being the highest debt repayment to be paid by Sri Lanka in a year due to colossal borrowings by the previous government.This could be considered as the highest sum of debt servicing to be repaid by Independent Sri Lanka within a year.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said Sri Lanka is embroiled in a gigantic debt trap. The main reason is that the loans obtained by the previous regime for infrastructure development has not brought any returns on its investments. Further the national revenue and the export earnings constantly came down since 2011 up to year 2014. The previous government had obtained US$1,303 million for the Hambantota Port and the first phase of the credit of Rs.340 million was released on a 6% interest.
In addition, 6% insurance premium should also be paid for the loan. Another US$ 4.5 billion had been obtained through International Sovereign Bond during the period between 2010 and 2014. This sovereign bond should be repaid in full as one billion dollar per annum from its maturity in 2019. However, the repayment of all these project loans and bonds began after 2014.
Its unfortunate that the previous government did not have any strategy to turn such giant loss making entities in to profit making ventures.The current government has made arrangements to convert these credits in to equity under the Public Private Partnership concept thereby relieving the people from the debt burden. While the government is taking untiring efforts to convert these white elephants into profit making institutions, and generate income and employment for the youth in the country, an opposition group is engaged in sabotaging such efforts charging that the government is attempting to sell off national resources to foreigners.It is high time people thought rationally in response to such misleading remarks made by these rival groups.

Malik refutes Minister Rajithas statement on Horana Tyre Factory
While refuting an alleged statement by Minister Rajitha Senarthne, the Minister of Development Strategies & International Trade Malik Samarawickrema yesterday said that he had revealed the identity of the investor for the Horana Tyre Factory Project well in advance to both the President and the Prime Minister.
Following is the statement issued by the Minister on the Project to Manufacture Radial and Solid Tyres at Wagawaththa in Horana.
It is noted that there have been articles published on the Horana Tyre Factory Project at Wagawaththa Industrial Zone, giving misleading information to the public. The statement made by Minister Rajitha Senarthne on this issue is also incorrect.
It is necessary to emphasize the fact that both the President and the Prime Minister were aware of the investor since I, myself informed them well in advance.
Furthermore, two Cabinet papers initially one proposing the land and then giving details of the incentives and other terms were submitted on this project and in addition the project was discussed and endorsed at several meetings of Cabinet Committee on Economic Management.
The statement that the land was given for Rs.100 per acre is incorrect. In fact, the Government Chief Valuer had valued the land at Rs. 170,825,000 and the investor has agreed to pay the total amount upfront. The Chief Valuer has also indicated that a further Rs. 10,000 be charged as an annual nominal fee. Further details pertaining to the project are given below.
*The 100 acre land at Horana in Wagawaththa Industrial Zone is a bare and undeveloped land undulating in most areas. Based on the technical investigations done by Central Engineering and Consultancy Bureau (CECB), it is noted that the investor has to incur a sum of about Rs.300 to 400 Mn as per the estimate to bring the land to a usable state. The investor claims that around 3m layer of weak soil has to be removed throughout the 25 acres of this land.
*BOI is not providing any infrastructure facilities like in other zones- e.g. even the waste Disposal Treatment Plant will be constructed by this investor. Similarly, all internal roads will have to be constructed by the investor.
* Based on valuation of land by Government Chief Valuer  an upfront payment of Rs. 170Mn is to be paid by investor. Since the project requires a large extent of land, the investor requested the land be leased to him based on the valuation determined by the Chief Valuer on the basis that infrastructure will be provided by him. The said request by the investor was accommodated by us in view of the high value of the investment of the project and the significant contribution expected to the economy, particularly linked with the rubber industry.
* BOI should promote investments and if necessary regulations and rules need to be changed to attract investments as the current regulations have failed to bring in investors. The FDI in 2015 was US$ 970 Mn and in 2016 it will be around US$ 450 Mn.which is extremely low by any standard.
*The total investment of this project is US$ 75Mn (Rs 11.25 Bn). The Project will employ around 3,000 people. It will add value to the rubber produced in Sri Lanka and convert raw rubber to radial and solid tyres. The annual export earnings will be above US$ 125Mn.
* There will also be inward transfer of technology as the Italian company Marangoniis expected to provide the technical know-how to produce tyres and other rubber based products.
* There are similar BOI projects, on BOI owned properties, which have been given on long term lease with an upfront payment & an annual fee is not charged from such projects  e.g MAS Group given 47 acres on 50 year lease and upfront payment is to be received and no annual fee is charged. This was a well-developed property with buildings and other infrastructure, although major repairs and renovations will have to be undertaken by the investor (former Kabool Lace property). Furthermore, a land vested by BOI in Kuliyapitiya was given on a freehold basis to Western Automobile Assembly for a proposed Vehicle Assembly Plant. The BOI has also granted 357 acres in the same area on a 99 year lease for 1 US$ per acre per annum to Merbok, in settlement of a dispute arising from a contract signed in year 2000.
* All expenses in developing this land, including constructing, a treatment plant, internal roadways and obtainingtransformers, etc., will be on account of the investor. Therefore, this project should be considered on the same basis as the MAS project.
* This investor applied to set up the plant in March 2016 when they were eligible for the tax concessions under BOI.
* Initially, BOI took steps to acquire a private land in Horana but since the owners of that land were unwilling to sell this property, BOI was instructed not to acquire that land as per this Presidents observation on Cabinet Paper No MODSIT/3/CAB/16/8 dated 2016.06.02
* We believe the investor should not be penalized for this delay on the part of BOI to make available the land. Accordingly, a Cabinet Memorandum was submitted on 2016.10.03 identifying the BOI owned land at Wagawaththa and explaining this position. Accordingly, approval was granted by the Cabinet on granting the tax concessions prevailing at the time of the application.
* It is worth to mention that in different countries promoting investment projects, various mechanisms exist for lease of land and providing infrastructure on case by case basis, based on evaluation of salient features of the project, level of infrastructure required, extent of land, etc. In India, in certain states land is given for one Indian Rupee per acre per year to attract investors. When proposals for investments are received, we do not look at the political affiliations of the investor and projects are evaluated and approved on the basis of economic and social benefits to the country.

My Reflections on cricket - Vijay Malalasekera
Vijay Malalasekera, the former Royal College and Cambridge Blue cricketer reminisces on cricket ahead of the 138th Battle of the Blues encounter against S Thomas College that commences on March 9 at the SSC grounds.
Q: What led you to take up to cricket
VM: From my boyhood days I had been very interested in cricket since in our neighbourhood we always played cricket as a pastime. My interest grew further as a result of my being taken to watch the Royal-Thomian cricket match from 1952 onwards. I saw Royal being defeated that year but was enamoured by the players who performed for Royal. This interest grew in me and since 1952 I watched every Royal-Thomian upto the time I left for England in 1963. Having seen players like T. Nirmalingam, Michael Wille, Lorensz Pereira, Michael Dias, the brothers Lalith and Nanda Senanayake and the likes of Dan Piachaud, Ronnie Reid, Michael Tissera, Michael Sproule and the likes of the opposing side made me want to play in the Big match. In particular, I remember Nirmalingams 69 in 1954 where he was run out for 69 and when the Royal scoreboard read 70 for 1 and the man out was Nirmalingam for 69. It was an innings of sheer brilliance. Ronnie Reids 157 in 1956 and his two short innings of 65 in 1957 and Tisseras 49 in 1954 were all inspiring innings. The Dias-Lalith Senanayake partnership in 1958 against the formidable leg-spinner Larif Idroos were innings to remember. Lalith went on to get 69 and 47 n.o. in 1960 and they were brilliant knocks made in absolute style for a right-hander. They all inspired me to promise myself that one day I will play in the Royal-Thomian as a Royalist.
Q: Any illustrious players of mention while playing for Cambridge and when in England
VM: The Cambridge team which I was a member of had one or two players of repute. In 1966, which was the 1st year that I played for the University when I was awarded the Cambridge Blue for cricket, the team was captained by Derryck Murray who was the youngest member of Sir Frank Worrells team which toured England in 1963. At the end of that series Derryck was a regular wicket-keeper for the West Indies and went on to break the world record during that tour. Further, he went on to be the vice-captain of the West Indies team under Clive Lloyd and was sent as ambassador for Trinidad and Tobago to Washington. Another player of repute was Roger Knight who played for Sussex and latterly went onto captain Surrey in the county championships. On his retirement from cricket, he became secretary to the M.C.C. for a period of 4 to 5 years and was elected president of the M.C.C. two years ago. Chris Martin-Jenkins though he had only a few games for the University went onto becomes one of the finest commentators on the game of cricket for the BBC. He also edited the Cricketer magazine and was extremely knowledgeable about the game. There were several others like Nick Cosh and Phil Carling who played a few games for their respective counties, Surrey and Glamorgan. If my memory serves me right, Phil Carling became secretary to the Glamorgan Cricket Club, subsequently.
Q: What were the fundamentals which you conveyed as a coach
VM: As a coach, one did not want to stifle the natural talent of youngsters provided their basic technique in playing the forward defence or the backward defence was in order. The fundamentals of the game had usually been taught at junior level which said very much for the coaches at that level. One only spoke about strategies during a particular game and the fact that we play to win within the rules of the game. The ethics and the morality of the players were very much a part of the coachs armoury. They were taught to play hard and if they lost, to learn to stand by the road and cheer as the winners go by. Sledging in any form was not tolerated upon and if anyone did indulge in such activity, he was dealt with severely. It was dinned into their minds that cricket was a team game and not an individual sport. The Royal-Thomian encounter in itself helped to bring camaraderie and build friendships which last a life time. Quite a number of my friends are old Thomians who have played against me such as Randy Morrell who captained STC in 63, Kumar Boralessa, etc. Randy Morrell will always make it a point to invite me to his house if and when I am in Australia.
Q: Who would you pick as industrious captains who played to obtain results and why
VM: As Richie Benaud the Australian skipper said, 90% of a good captain is luck and 10% is strategy. It is indeed difficult to pick one industrious captain but persons like Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Arjuna Ranatunga, and Michael Tissera I would say were good captains. I would like to add to that list the Royal captain of 1962 Darrell Lieversz as he inspired the entire side which had a number of freshers to perform as a team under many a trying circumstance.
Q: Can cricket produce fulltime professionals engaged in pursuits other than cricket You being one how did you manage studies, work and sports
VM: In the current day and age, cricket itself is a profession though it ends fairly early in life. At the time we were playing we did not have a huge schedule of fixtures even though we were playing counties and visiting national teams at Cambridge. The lack of a strenuous schedule helped us to combine both studies as well as playing cricket. At the outset let me tell you that it was difficult as you cannot fail an exam at Cambridge for you were sent down from the University which meant that you came down without a degree. In the old days, persons such as F.C. de Saram, Chippie Gunasekera, H.C. Perera and H.I.K. Fernando were able to combine cricket with their professional careers. In the modern day, this is not the case. Fortunately or unfortunately, particularly in Sri Lanka, learning and achieving a career in life has been given the greatest prominence. In a way quite rightly so, in the competitive world we live in.

Nations first Palliative Care Centre to open in Anuradhapura
The government along with Shanthi Foundation, an Australian registered charity, announced its plans to establish Sri Lankas first ever Palliative Care Centre in Anuradhapura.
This is a joint initiative involving the Presidential Task Force on Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease, the Health Ministry, the Sri Lankan High Commission of Australia and the Prime Ministers Office.
The project is endorsed by the Palliative Care Associationof Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka Medical Association.
Palliative care is the medical specialty dealing with the physical, psychosocial and spiritual well being of patients diagnosed with life limiting illnesses such as chronic kidney disease (CKDU) and cancer.
Sri Lanka has four hospices run by various charities but lacks a specialised palliative care unit to take care of the growing number of CKDU and cancer patients.
The proposed facility in Anuradhapura, estimated to cost over one million dollars upon completion, will have the capacity to hold 40 beds and plans to operate a mobile Community Palliative Care Unit (CPCU) to visit patients who are not ambulatory.
In addition to a palliative care clinic, the facility will house a training and research unit. The government will provide five to 10 acres on a 99-year lease (free of charge), for this venture.
The facility will be located within five km from the Anuradhapura hospital. Doctors and nurses working in the Anuradhapura hospital will provide care to the patients who will be referred by the consultant nephrologists, oncologists, etc.
The training and research unit will engage in collaborative research with Australian universities and hospitals to ensure that the most up-to-date standards are available in Sri Lanka.

The old-time saying The hand that rocks the cradle, rules the world is becoming more relevant to todays society as the role of women become ever more essential in the economic growth.
As a result of the growing role of women in decision making and equal participation, the world has seen many women making great strides in the entrepreneur industry.
Microfinance has become an important tool for women as they start contributing to economic activities. Over the years many organizations have worked towards empowering women and have seen positive growth in their skills through the support of Microfinance in most parts of the country. Women in the present day are recognized as an imperative catalyst in the economic rejuvenation, especially in developing countries. Thus NDB takes every effort to provide constant encouragement and propel financial guidance for Sri Lankan women with a determination to grow in their life.
Maduwanthi, a wife and a mother began her finger food business at the Galle Face Green with one mobile cart. With the NDB Diviaruna microfinance loan scheme, she bought a second and third mobile cart. The persistent Maduwanthi didnt stop from there; she applied for another loan and acquired canteen services at a multinational construction company. Today she makes an average sales turnover of 16 million per annum.
NDB recently held a workshop on the Empowerment of Small Scale Women Entrepreneurs. The programme was aimed towards empowering women to participate fully in building financial stability across all sectors to build stronger economies. The objective was to ensure the inclusion of womens talents, skills and energies in developing sustainable livelihood for their families and communities.
This programme initiated by the NDB Microfinance Unit and the NDB Nawam Mawatha Branch is the Banks first sustainability project for 2017. NDB makes every effort to see our mirco level entrepreneurs get to the next level and this is one initiative to help them do that. said Delerene Seneviratne  Vice President Administration and Services, NDB
A special guest at this workshop was Yamika Gunwardena, an Anthurium Exporter who started off at the micro level. In her speech she spoke of her path to success and shared her experiences of being a female entrepreneur. Every woman has immense power within, make a determination to achieve and the world will help you. Honesty is key and one must do the right thing at the right time.
Shalika Priyangani - Micro Finance Officer of NDB in her presentation discussed on how to improve knowledge on financial information and financial security. The problem starts when you dont know what happens to the money you earn. It is important that you discuss with the Bank on ways to make most of your savings without having to use your capital to pay up loans
The workshop also included a special discussion by Dr. Hiranthini De Silva on how to secure a good health. The participants were given invaluable health tips and advice on how to avoid Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, High Cholesterol, Heart Disease and more.
A session on Grooming and Personality was also carried out by Ganga Wanigaratne  Assistant Vice President  Operations, Account Services and Credit Administration.

New envoy in Sri Lanka to  increase trade ties with Lithuania
Sri Lanka's trade with Lithuania is at a very low ebb and it will now take a huge leap forward with the appointment of an Ambassador to Sri Lanka.
Consul General for Lithuania and Supreme Global Holdings Chairman R.M.Manivannan said that the fact that an Ambassador was appointed to Sri Lanka is a sign that both countries are keen to promote bilateral trade.
He said that plans are now underway to set up a Sri Lanka Lithuanian Business Council and also several trade promotion delegations too will take place from this year.
He said that Sri Lankan companies too can take advantage of some of the advanced technology from Lithuania. We will aggressively promote trade, culture, tourism, education, and other goals as may be formulated.
Ambassador LaimonasTalat-Kelpsa said that he had met up with top government officials to discuss the strengthening of political, economic, diplomatic, social and cultural ties between Lithuania and Sri Lanka.
A website was launched to promote trade among Sri Lanka. Ambassador LaimonasTalat-Kelpsa and Consul General for Lithuania R.M. Manivannan and officials launching the website. Picture by Saliya Rupasinghe.  
He said that the trade between the two countries was last year was 6 million Euros with 5 Million in favour of Sri Lanka. Main exports are tea, coffee, seafood and chemical products while imports from Lithuania have been machinery and wood items.
I am sure this trade figure can increase by twofold soon as in the case of India where both trade and education soared in recent years.
He said that Lithuania has laser technology that is the best in the world and Sri Lankan industries must try to acquire this technology from us. In addition we will open out more opportunities for Sri Lankan apparel worlds and also for high skilled labor for which new laws have being introduced.Sri Lanka and Lithuania established diplomatic relations in 1996. Ambassador LaimonasTalat-Kelpsa achievements are Lithuania's invitation to NATO occasion a memorable mark (2003), Lithuanian National Defence System commemorative accession to NATO Medal (2004) and Georgia's Order of Honour (2012).

No Cabinet paper to legalise homosexuality: Rajitha
There had never been a Cabinet paper to legalise homosexuality, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said in Parliament yesterday. The minister made this observation responding to a question by MP Piyal Nishantha. He also said that that there was never a move to legalise homosexuality or prostitution but ensuring the rights of all Sri Lankans.
Nishantha said the President on Wednesday said that he threw away the Cabinet paper aimed at legalising homosexuality. I dont need to explain it to you but you can read the Cabinet paper clearly on your own and see, the minister said. The paper was to ensure that people of different sexual orientation enjoys the same rights as others.
Nishantha said homosexuals might use the Cabinet paper as a loop hole to argue that their lifestyle was legal.

Nugegoda rally aims to protect corrupt in previous regime: Mujibur
The aim of the Nugegoda rally organised by the Joint Opposition is to arouse the people towards aggressive and violent behaviour with the aim of building a wall of defence for the protection of individuals responsible for fraud, racketeering, embezzlement and various malpractices during the previous regime, UNP MP Mujibur Rahman said yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo, he said investigations against the former Presidents group are almost complete while the government was in the process of taking legal action against them.
"They know there is no escape. They want to mobilise the people against the government. Many properties of the Rajapaksa families are not under their own names. The actual property owners are refusing to give these properties back to them. These people are being threatened that the Joint Opposition will come to power in another two or three months and all properties will be taken back," Rahuman said.
"They are also trying to influence officers conducting investigations against them saying that they will be come into the power soon and taking action against them. During the previous regime, we like to question whether MP Wimal Weerawansa as Housing Minister constructed even a single house for the needy people outside his family members," he said.
The MP said although the last Nugegoda meeting was titled as 'Rise with Mahinda' nobody rose with him except only those who faced imprisonment on various charges.
The so called start of a revolution rally in Nugegoda today will be unsuccessful because the former President has instructed many SLFP members not to attend the meeting, he said.
"Will the people vote again for politicians who are well known for corruption, nepotism and deceits. People know that they are a bunch of thieves and their leader is Mahinda Rajapksa and that if they come to power, they will do the same thing," Rahuman said.
The government has embarked on a massive social and economic drive.Democracy has won in this country. But the Rajapaksa group wants to whip up racism, communalism and savagery to achieve their own agendas. The country which was black listed by the international community during the previous regime has now acquired international recognition. But, these groups want to destroy that recognition, he said.
"They are now trying to wriggle away from the various law suits by spending vast amount of wealth they accumulated during the previous regime. We have nothing to hide about the COPE investigation. About 40 COPE reports came out during the previous government, but none were referred to the Attorney General. We referred the first COPE report under our government to the Attorney General," Rahuman said.
The President has also appointed a Presidential Commission to investigate the matter and this is democracy. The previous government influenced former COPE Chairman Wjayadasa Rajapakshe to resign from his post because he exposed many corrupt deals through the report. When they could not do it , they prorogued Parliament and appointed someone else, he said.
UNP MP Thushara Indunil Amarasena said it was former regime that completely sold the port city land to China.
"We renegotiated with China and gave it on 99-year-old lease. It was the UNP government which started many free trade zones and investment promotion zones. We like to ask if the former President opened a single factory even though several factories were closed down during his rule," he said.

One pint of kindness
As new blood flowed into their veins, Sampath Niroshan watched in amazement at the transformation in her premature twin girls. From being floppy, pale and lethargic, the babies became suffused with a rosy glow. When every day was bringing new complications, seeing them respond so immediately to blood transfusions was the most hopeful experience of their first precarious weeks.
They were born at 28 weeks and for a while we were not certain either would survive, says Sampath. They needed many blood transfusions, and I remember how much better they were immediately afterwards. You could see the blood going through them. They were pink and active, in fact more alive.
The babies arrived just as Sampath and his wife, Ganga, had settled in for a traditional family gathering with his parents in Gotatuva. When Ganga experienced cramps, she had no idea she was in labour. She described her symptoms to a midwife who summoned an ambulance.
Ganga is not alone. There are many others who needs generosity of a fellow human. Yours could be only one pint, but it still matters in saving someones life.
A blood donation campaign organised by Thurunu Asipath Sansadaya will be held at Chandana Vihara, Gotatuwa, on January 29 at 8.30 am. Anyone interested in donating blood is welcome to take part in the campaign.
Take part in this noble, worthy, cause and offer that large hearted generous hand to someone in need.

An open letter to SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayke: Consultation on constitutional reforms
Hon. Duminda Dissanayake
General Secretary
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)
Dear Duminda,
I thought I must write to you openly when I learned through the mass media, that some SLFP seniors in government were unsupportive of serious constitutional reforms and accordingly had persuaded President Sirisena, as SLFP leader to direct that the SLFP engages in some dialogue and consultations on the proposed reforms. You may consider my views as part of this consultation and on my part, they are complimentary to my personal submissions to the LLRC during its public hearings and draws from my experience as the former Director General of Relief, Rehabilitation and Reconciliation under President Kumaratunga and more recently as Chairman of the Resettlement Authority.
Consider the mandate of January 2015
I believe the context for the current process of constitutional reforms is the mandate received by President Sirisena in January 2015, which is clearly a mandate for reform. Those of the SLFP who were not part of securing that mandate, but now within Government, who were corrected by the sovereign voting public of our country, should be extra careful when opposing that mandate and defining the mandate is certainly not the purview of the defeated candidate former President Rajapaksa.
Public consultations of the constitutions have already occurred
You are no doubt aware that public consultations on the proposed constitutional reforms occurred throughout our country and there was opportunity for all stakeholders to make their submissions through this consultation process. It would be useful for the SLFP to not reinvent the wheel as it were but to study, incorporate and draw from the public consultations already held.
A democratic deficit
A vast majority of the period since the introduction of the first republican constitution of 1972 and continuing through the period of the current constitution of 1978, Sri Lanka has been governed under Emergency Regulations which have superseded the Constitution and thereby compromised and damaged constitutional governance and the rule of law in our land. While this situation may have been understandable in the context of our decades long civil armed conflict it becomes untenable in a period thereafter. The democratic deficit which Sri Lanka suffers from needs to be rectified through constitutional reform and the abolition of the executive presidency, the implementation of electoral reforms, the strengthening of individual and human rights, are all part of the efforts to address this democratic deficit.
Creating an inclusive state
It was former member of Parliament and LTTE suicide bomb victim late Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam, who perhaps best explained the rationale for constitutional reforms nearly twenty-five years ago, when he stated that we should rectify the anomaly of having imposed a mono ethnic state on a multi ethnic polity.
It is patently clear to all but the willfully blind, that Sri Lanka is a society polarized on ethnic lines, with state institutions and structures of governance that are non-inclusive and intolerant. The virulent demagogy surrounding the singing of the national anthem also in Tamil at last years national day celebrations, demonstrates both the mono ethno-lingual nature of state festivals in the past and how much we need to reform to be inclusive and tolerant. If the SLFP position is that the 13th Amendment should first be implemented fully, then there is no impediment to the executive decisions of immediately gazetting those provisions of the constitution not yet implemented.
Examine prior SLFP positions on devolution under President Kumaratunga and President Rajapaksa
The SLFP has had a rich tradition of seeking political solutions of inclusivity, diversity and tolerance going back to the Bandaranaike  Chelvanyagam pact more than half a century ago. More usefully and practically, it is incumbent upon the SLFP to learn from and incorporate the policies, politics and thinking of both the SLFP led PA and UPFA governments of President Kumaratunga and President Rajapaksa. Especially relevant in this regard are the various work, recommendations and policies of President Rajapaksa under his initiatives of the All Part Representative Committee (APRC) and its various working groups, all ably headed and led in the past by the old left leaders of DEW Gunasekera and Prof. Tissa Vitharane. If former President Rajapaksa is not standing by prior SLFP government positions on devolution including those of his own Administration, then such policy changes may well be construed as opportunistic and parochially motivated for extraneous reasons of temporary political self-interest by a person who promises to topple the government during the calendar year and need not be taken seriously.
Seriously examine Rajapaksa administration mistakes and avoid a return to the past
I would respectfully submit that a key requirement for the SLFP, before the next general elections due in mid-2020, is an open and honest examination of what went so badly wrong, especially during the second Rajapaksa term and seek not only remedial measures but also to chart a new course for the future rather than advocate a return to the past. The public perception and allegations of rampant corruption, mismanagement of the economy especially in mounting public debt on grandiose and ill-conceived projects, ruining our foreign relations with all our key trading partners, violating and abusing human rights with impunity, including press freedom, centralizing power in the executive presidency, subverting the judiciary and institutionalizing nepotism all contributed to ending the Rajapaksa presidency, sooner rather than later.
Finally, I admired your courageous and principled stand in supporting then Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena during the Presidential Election of 2015. Your political foresight and maturity is a tribute to your late father and I can think of no younger leader better suited to hold the responsible position of SLFP General Secretary.
As you are aware, I currently serve as Advisor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but please consider these submissions as done in my personal capacity.
I take this opportunity to wish you every success in your endeavours.
With best regards,
Harim Peiris

I resigned from the SEC as I did not condone illegal activities:MP Prof. Ashu Marasinghe
UNP MP Prof. Ashu Marasinghe yesterday, said in Parliament that he was forced to resign from the post of Chairman of the State Engineering Corporation (SEC), because he did not condone illegal activities.
The MP made this comment as a reply to the statements by the Joint Opposition, demanding his arrest in connection with the charges against former Minister Wimal Weerawansa over the misuse of SEC vehicles.
The MP taking part in the debate yesterday, said he at no point approved or encouraged sending SEC vehicles for the use of the then Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities Minister Weerawansa or his relatives and close associates.
I did not do such foolish things. I told the then Minister that such acts could lead to imprisonment. That was the reason I resigned from the post. I took office in May 2010 and gave my resignation letter on May 25, 2011. I resigned on . The acting Deputy General Manager (DGM) who is now under probe, was appointed after I left. I gave a statement to the Police in connection to this charge and it was given in the B report too, he explained.
The MP further revealed that the project to install toll gates at the Southern Expressway was received by the SEC after a competitive bidding process in 2011, but the project had to be given up due to political pressure.
The SEC had made the lowest bid of Rs 1,000 million. However, soon after we secured it, I got a phone call from former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, asking me to give it up stating the SEC was not capable enough to handle it. Both former President Rajapaksa and former Minister Weerawansa wanted me to resign, but I resisted. Later, I resigned and after that they tried to arrest me. Muhammad Muzammil, who was a working director of the SEC at that time, came to my house and took all the files that were in my possession, threatening me of arrest, he said.
He also called on COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti to hold a special inquiry on the project to install toll gates at the Expressway. After I left, the SEC was removed from the project and given to the private sector. Probe as to why this project was diverted to another party allowing the SEC to collapse, he said.
I ask Weerawansa and those in his party to avoid throwing stones at others, while living in glass houses. The truth would prevail, he added.
SPMC medicine production will not be handed over to India
The government has no any intention of handing over medicine production of the State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) to India, but to expand its production, said Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
He made this observation yesterday in Parliament, in response to an allegation made by JVP Parliamentarian Nalinda Jayathissa that the government was taking measures to hand over a section of the medicine production of the SPMC to India.
It is not what is happening there, Minister Senaratne said. The government is attempting to expand the factory. According to plans, when the expansion is made, a section of the SPMC has to be closed down temporarily.
He said the SPMC without terminating the production, a factory would be rented out in India and production would be continued with Sri Lankan staff.
Once the construction is over, everything would be brought back to the country, the Minister said. We sought opportunities to hire one in Sri Lanka, but the issue was, when it is done in Sri Lanka, the factory owner could commence the production with SPMC technology immediate after the factory was handed over to them. It would affect SPMCs business. That was the reason for us to hire one from India.
The Minister also asked MP Nalinda Jayathissa to inquire into the stance taken by the Sri Lankan Medical Council on the proposal of the SAITM to hand over the Nevil Fernando Hospital with 1,000 beds in order to enable SAITM students to receive clinical training. He made this demand when Nalinda Jayathissa said the ministers were attempting to grant permission for the SAITM although it was illegal.
The Minister said that he had not have any dialogue with the SLMC, but there were three concerns over SAITM. They were the lack of Public health, Forensic medicine and Clinical training, the Minister said. Following a Court order, the Kaduwela MOH and Avissawella hospital have been directed for the students to receive Public health and Forensic medicine exposure. SAITM has also proposed to hand over the Neville Fernando Hospital to the government
MP Adeikkalanathan wants President and PM to send special rep to Vavuniya
Deputy Chairman of Committees and TNA MP S Adeikkalanathan requested the President and Prime Minister to send a special representative to Vavuniya to discuss with those engaged in the hunger strike.
The MP was speaking at the debate in Parliament yesterday. He said the hunger strike of family members of the disappeared persons was continuing for the fourth day, adding that the health conditions of some of them had declined.
Many of those engaged in the hunger strike are poor people. The Government should take responsibility if something happened to them.
The Government said that Prison Reforms, Resettlement and Rehabilitation Minister D M Swaminathan would be sent to Vavuniya to discuss matters, but we request the Government to send a person who was better suited than him, he said.
He also called on the people who organized demonstrations elsewhere in the country in support of the hunger strike to come to Vavuniya and add their strength to the campaign.
Protests against SAITM: Govt. will not bow down to protests: Dr. Senaratne
This government would neither throw the SAITM away nor bow down to their requests, said Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne in Parliament.
He said they protested against the Ragama Private Medical Faculty in the 1980s as there was a left camp in the world but now there is none. The entire world is practicing one system.
He further said the Jaffna Medical College too commenced as a private university, adding that then only the government took measures to set up the Colombo Medical Faculty.
Even in China or Laos, have no free education and free health services.
He made these observations joining the debate held in Parliament yesterday.

Presidential Commission to probe CB bond issue questionable: NSSP
Nava Sama Samaja Party (NSSP) leader Dr. Wickramabahu Karunaratne yesterday said it was questionable how ethical it was to appoint a Presidential Commission to probe the Central Bank bond issue.
He said it looked like the President was following the former President's footsteps.
Addressing a press conference at the party office in Colombo yesterday, he said all who contributed towards the January 8 victory, say the President should take steps in connection with the bond issue after discussing with the Prime Minister.
Dr. Karunaratne said the President has the right to condemn homosexuality and lesbianism based on the values and ethics of the country.
"The world may think that Sri Lanka does not treat people equally and discriminate some. Even prostitutes attained Arahathship during the Buddha's time. Even Buddhism does not reject LGBT rights," he added.

Princess Dianas unseen letters reveal Prince Harrys naughty side
Prince Harry was known for getting into trouble during his teenage years, but it turns out the royal has always had a rebellious streak.
Personal letters written by Princess Diana reveal Harry was constantly in trouble at boarding school, the BBC reports.
The handwritten notes, which were sent to former Buckingham Palace steward Cyril Dickman, also describe how the close bond between Harry and his older brother William developed when they were young.
William adores his little brother and spends the entire time swamping Harry with an endless supply of hugs and kisses, hardly letting the parents near! Diana wrote in one letter dated March 2, 1985, when Harry was just a few months old.
The reaction to one tiny persons birth has totally overwhelmed us and I can hardly breathe for the mass of flowers that are arriving here!
In a later correspondence from July 1993, Diana updated Dickman on how Harry, then aged 8, was getting on at school. The boys are well and enjoying boarding school a lot, although Harry is constantly in trouble! she wrote.
The touching letters will be sold by Cambridgeshire auction house Cheffins on 5 January. Items from the collection of royal memorabilia, which also include Christmas cards signed by the Queen and Prince Philip, are expected to reach between 80 and 900 ($99 and $1,108).

Royal College Western Orchestra Annual Concert 17
The Annual Concert 17, organised by the Royal College Western Orchestra and the Western Music Society of Royal College, will take place tomorrow at 6.30pm at the Royal College Main Hall. Entrance is free.
The Concerts performances will include a wide range of orchestral music, from compositions from the Baroque Era, to modern classics. The RCWO will also be joined by the Royal College Choir, while the concert will also feature a guest performance by the Orchestra of Lyceum International School, Nugegoda.
The pieces for the evening will be conducted by three well-known individuals in the field of music: Bernard Wacheux, Prof. Ajit Abeysekera and Srimal Weerasinghe
The Special Guest Conductor for the evening, Bernard Wacheux, is a well-known French Conductor and Violinist as well as a Saxophonist, who started his career in Germany with the orchestras of Frankfurt and Koblenz.
He is an avid jazz lover, has appeared on many multi-national TV programs, and has been leading the French Soloists orchestra of France for 10 years. Prof. Ajit Abeysekera is a performing member of the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka.
He was also one of its conductors from the year 1996 to 2016. He is an Old Royalist as well as an Emeritus Professor of Chemistry at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. Srimal Weerasinghe, currently performs as the Principal Oboe of the National Youth Orchestra of Sri Lanka and the Colombo Wind Orchestra, while he also performs regularly at the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka and the Chamber Music Society of Colombo.
His career as a Conductor began in 2015, under the guidance of Manilal Weerakoon. He is the Assistant Conductor of the Junior Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka, and a music teacher and conductor at The Music Project. The RCWO emerged 1st Place at the All Island Western Music & Dance Competition  Orchestra Category in both 2015 and 2016 under his baton.
The Concert will feature a variety of compositions, from classical masterpieces to famous movie soundtracks. From the classical era, the RCWO will be performing March in C (KV 408/1) & Overture to The Marriage of Figaro by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, as well as Symphony No. 5 in C Minor  Finale (Op. 67) composed by Ludwig van Beethoven and arranged by Ralph Matesky.
The Royal College Choir will be joining the RCWO for their performances of For unto Us a Child Is Born from Messiah Part 1  Scene 3 by George Frideric Handel and Time To Say Goodbye by Andrea Bocelli. The performances will also include Slavonic Dance No. 1 (Op. 72) by Antonin Dvorak, Gabriels Oboe (Theme from The Mission) by Ennio Morricone, which will feature a Solo Performance by Oboist Srimal Weerasinghe, as well as Danno Budunge by Vishwanath Laoji.
Founded in 1999 with the consent of H.L.B. Gomez, the principal of Royal College at the time, the Royal College Western Orchestra, since its inception, had had several trainers from the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka (SOSL) as well as the National Youth Orchestra (NYO). The orchestra held its first public performance in 2002, conducted by Prof. Ajit Abeysekera, a conductor at the SOSL. Amal Abeysekera was the concertmaster of the orchestra. After a prolonged hiatus, the RCWO was re-established in 2015, with Srimal Weerasinghe as the Conductor and Priyanthi Sudusinghe as the Teacher-in Charge.
Nisal Jinadasa was the concertmaster. Its first performance was at the All Island Western Music & Dance Competition 2015, where it competed against some of the best school orchestras of Sri Lanka and secured 1st Place.
Soon after the All-Island Competition, the orchestra began to perform at a variety of events. The year after, the RCWO was invited to perform at the 137th Battle of the Blues Media Conference, which was the springboard to our continued success.
The orchestra performed Amigos Para Sempre as well as the School Anthems of Royal College and St. Thomas College, along with the Orchestra of St. Thomas College, Mt. Lavinia, as well as the renowned De Lanerolle Brothers. More performances soon followed, with the orchestra being invited to perform at the Annual Colours Awarding Ceremony 2015 and the Annual Band & Orchestra Concert of Lyceum International School, Nugegoda. Getting to the point where the Orchestra is at present was by no means a cakewalk.
The process of reviving a defunct school orchestra: from catching the attention of Western Music students at school to being able to emerge as champions at the All-Island Western Music and Dance Competitions only a few months after commencing rehearsals was extremely strenuous and yet, after facing all obstacles and shining through, the radical idea of organising an orchestra concert was brought up.
The RCWO made the bold decision to take on the task of making this dream reality in order to add to the success of the Orchestra as well as solidifying its reputation as one of the best of its kind.
During the weeks leading up to the Concert, sectional practices were carried out for String Section by Dilpahan Mallikarachchi, a Professional Music Teacher who also performed at the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka and the Krasna Chamber Ensemble, while Wind Sectional Practices were carried out by Toshiaki Kamada and Sugath Weerasekera. Our heartfelt gratitude goes out to these few individuals who worked tirelessly to improve the quality of each section, putting aside their busy schedule and committing themselves to the betterment of the orchestra.
The Royal College Choir and the Orchestra of Lyceum International School, Nugegoda, will be joining with the RCWO as our guest performers. The RCWO performances of For unto Us a Child is Born from Messiah Part 1  Scene 3 by George Frideric Handel and Time To Say Goodbye by Andrea Bocelli, as well as the School of our Fathers, composed by H.L. Reed and orchestrated by Manilal Weerakoon, will be accompanied by the Royal College Choir.
The choir trainer is Sureka Amerasinghe. The Orchestra of Lyceum International School, Nugegoda, directed by Naveen Fernando, will be performing a set of pieces from classics to pops.

In search of an alternative
Almost seven decades have passed since independence. Socio-economic problems inherited at the time of independence still remain unresolved. In fact, some have worsened. Though there is improvement in absolute terms the relative impoverishment of the bulk of the population cannot be ignored. For example, the gap between the haves and the have nots has widened. The National Question did aggravate continuously. It resulted in a three-decade fratricidal war.
Even seven years since the end of the war a stable peace and national unity remain distant dreams. The economy is in a constant state of crisis. The country is in the tight grip of a death trap which has led to the mortgaging of the future generations too.
Throughout the post-independence era the UNP and the SLFP had ruled the country in turns. It is not an exaggeration to say that both of them had failed to fulfill popular aspirations. Whatever development that resulted from their rule, its benefits have not permeated to the grass-roots level. The rich have become richer and the poor poorer.
The situation had deteriorated to such an extent that democratic freedoms and human rights of the people got eroded to such an extent by the end of the first decade of the 21st Century that only peoples intervention in the 2015 Presidential election prevented the institution of a Constitutional dictatorship whereby crony capitalism would hold sway.
New combination
Power, which had hitherto been held by the SLFP or the UNP separately, is now shared by them both unitedly. This is the new situation. Whether this new combination would constitute an alternative to the failed system that existed prior to it depends on whether it could pursue an alternative policy of development which is basically people-friendly and fulfills the aspirations of the masses.
The performance of the Government during its first two years in office does not give the masses any confidence that it is ready to pursue an alternative path of development that is fundamentally different from what was pursued hitherto. Despite the rhetoric and loud proclamations of good intentions by the leaders the Government has displayed not only reluctance and hesitation in implementing some vital promises it made at elections but also disowned them.
For example, it is intransigently adhering to certain provisions in the new Constitution as non-negotiable and non-changeable even without considering whether there are any viable alternatives that would satisfy all communities. In the case of devolution of power, a powerful segment of the Government comprising members of both the SLFP and the UNP openly declare their intention not only refrain from going beyond the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. In fact, they also intend to truncate it.
As regards eliminating fraud and corruption the Treasury Bond scam as well as the snails pace at which investigations and legal proceedings against certain bigwigs of the former regime are being conducted has given rise to a justifiable suspicion in the mind of the public whether there is collusion in the higher echelons of the political and administrative hierarchy to shield the culprits. The discriminatory nature of the investigations where sprats and small fish are netted leaving out sharks and whales adds to this suspicion.
Former regime
This has given rise to the now popular saying Unuth horu, Munuth horu (Those are rogues, these are rogues). Whats to be done
Obviously an alternative has to be found. The present regime finds it incapable of cutting the umbilical cord which binds it to the former regime. That is why practices and traditions of yesteryear are followed by the present regime without question.
It is necessary to be selective in the choice of foreign investments keeping the interests of the local industries as well as the welfare of the masses at heart instead of allowing the robber barons full freedom to exploit our resources.
Policies such as PPP or private public participation needs to be considered objectively in each case instead of giving blanket approval or taking it as the last resort of an economy in distress.
It is also necessary to discard dogmatic adherence to worn out theories that say market forces decide everything and the best is small government which washes its hands off business of economic enterprises.
Not only government regulation but also government ownership in certain strategic industrial and service sectors is essential for an independent development of developing countries such as ours.
It is necessary to be cautious against the imposition of the Western model of economic development recommended and often imposed by the triumvirate of global capitalism  the IMF, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation.
The inability of the present government is not due to any personal weaknesses of the leaders but due to the social nature of the class forces it represents.
What is necessary is a new alignment of social forces, one that would be more representative of the vast down-trodden masses that could take the country along an independent path of development.
Developing countries
The sad fact, however, is that such a force strong enough to take over power is not yet on the scene. It is only a historic necessity and a goal to be achieved.
Experience throughout the developing countries as historical experience elsewhere shows that the alternative should be Leftist in character. Unfortunately the Sri Lankan Left is only a shadow of its former strength. It is fragmented and divided on numerous grounds.
Its inability to appear as a cohesive and reliable force is rank opportunism among its traditional and even not so traditional segments in their desire to catch hold of the reins of government in haste.
Differences on the National Question contribute to this division with a considerable section flirting with communal minded forces or pleasing their sentiments.
It also prevents the unity of the urban, rural and estate workers. The fragmentation of trade unions on political party lines is also major factor for the weakness of the Left.
In order to move towards a United Left it would be necessary to forge unity first in the struggle for concrete demands to secure democracy and win peoples rights. The struggle for an alternative path of development would be unthinkable without a clear vision and programme of action which also has to be evolved in the struggle for reforms for all that pushes men into action has to pass through their minds first.

SLFP calls for proper audit on bond issue
A proper audit of the Bond issue is needed to find out how much was lost, SLFP national organiser and Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said yesterday.
Perpetual Treasuries which began with a capital of Rs. 300 million in 2014, by 2015 April earned a profit of Rs 10100.6 million. How did this happen, he asked.
The Minister also insisted that the Presidential Commission to investigate into the bond scam was not a delaying tactic but a measure to speed up action against those accused.
The COPE report cannot be used as evidence in courts. It has to be directed to the Attorney General and then it has to be directed to the CID or police to conduct fresh investigations to record evidence. But we all know, given the experience of the last two years, many cases with the police dont see the light of day,Premajayantha said at a media conference at the SLFP headquarters.
He added that a Presidential Commission which wielded a wider mandate could conduct investigations faster and more accurately, The findings of the Commission can be used as evidence in a court of law. This makes it easier for the police to prosecute. This is helpful because at times the Police or even the Bribery Commission may not have the technical know how to conduct such complex financial investigations, said the minister.
The Commission is to submit its report in three months.
The Commission is one of the recommendations made by the SLFP Central Committee and according to Premajayantha and SLFP Media Spokesperson Dilan Perera, a necessary one, given the conduct of the IGP in recent times, The President noticed that the IGP was preparing to file the case as a civil case and not a criminal one. The Commission on the other hand will look into how both can be done, said Perera.
The IGP needs to do his job. Many were of the belief that with independent commissions appointing heads, things will change, but that has not happened. We need to change the way the system works, added Premajayantha.
Perera explained that they have ensured that no one could now find an excuse to postpone prosecution. Parliament on Tuesday held an adjournment debate on the bond scam and Premajayantha speaking in Parliament alleged that since the first bond issue on 27 February 2017, it had occurred seven times.

Sloppy South African fielding hands Sri Lankan series win
CAPE TOWN, Wednesday: AB de Villiers's sparkling half century could not prevent Sri Lanka from snatching a five-wicket victory with one ball to spare as they capitalised on six dropped catches by South Africa in the third Twenty20 on Wednesday.
Niroshan Dickwella belted a career best 68 from 51 balls and an unbeaten 37 off just 16 balls from Seekkuge Prasanna helped Sri Lanka to claim a 2-1 series win as South Africa's victory hopes were dashed by their woeful fielding.
The hosts, resting a number of their leading players, posted 169 for five in 20 overs after winning the toss and electing to bat.
But the fielding blunders from the home side, including three in consecutive balls off a farcical Wayne Parnell over, allowed Sri Lanka to reach their target of 170. South Africas innings was anchored by a fine 63 off 44 balls from De Villiers, who warmed to his task after a slow start as he returned from seven months on the sidelines with an elbow injury.
Batting at number three, he put on 71 for the second wicket with Reeza Hendricks (41 from 34 balls) before being caught at point off Nuwan Kulasekara (1-30). Mangaliso Mosehle (32 not out from 15) provided a much-needed boost to the run rate towards the end of the innings with three massive sixes. Sri Lanka managed to stay with the rate as South Africa gifted them life after life with a sloppy fielding display.
The home side looked to have the advantage though when the tourists required 52 from the final four overs, but Prasanna continued to hit boundaries in a match-winning display.
They required 11 from the final over bowled by debutant seamer Dane Paterson (0-38 in 3.5 overs), but two boundaries from Asela Gunaratne (11 not out) sealed victory for the elated tourists. The teams will start a five-match one-day series in Port Elizabeth on Saturday.

The spirit of St. Andrews
Juliet Coombe walked back in time on a historic tour of heritage gem Jetwing St. Andrews infamous for its popular Road Hole bar and superb old world hospitality.
As I stand at the road entrance to Jetwing St Andrews in the heart of historic Nuwara Eliya, looking up across pristine gardens and at the grand faade of this colonial styled building, with the wonderfully long covered grand staircase to reception, I can imagine how it must have felt, back in the heydays of tea-growing, to visit such establishments where perfection was an excellent cup of tea, taken at precisely 4.30pm, amongst perfectly presented gardens, with people dressed largely in white going about the leisurely business of practising their tennis, observing plant and tree life, chatting gaily with each other and occasionally saddling the horses or jumping into a Bentley for a thrilling ride up the high hills surrounding this beautiful hotel in its breath-taking setting.
The property was originally just a plot of land given by the Crown to a faithful civil servant in 1875 who seems to have sold off bits of it and built the original house that later became the Scots Club. Ishanda, my historic guide and well known naturalist now world famous for his frog watching tours, tells me, We dont know for sure but the name, St Andrews, may come from a combination of the Scots Club and the golf course just beyond the bottom of the garden where the 9th hole has been named St Andrews and where the owner swapped a strip of land elsewhere in exchange for what is now the 10th tee. Looking across the golf course I have never seen so many huge eucalyptus trees in my life and reckon, probably erroneously that some must be 100 metres high.
It wasnt until the early 1900s when the house became a hotel and over the course of time bits have been added on here and there, which might make it seem hotchpotch but doesnt actually detract from it in any way as all the additions look stunning and make for a very interesting looking and feeling hotel. As we walk along the corridors Ishanda points out the mainly red tiled floor and tells me, It is 127 years old. I try to imagine all the feet that have fallen upon these tiles, they do look really old but I wonder why they arent more worn in the middle but Im quickly distracted by other rich features in the hotel such as the pictures of antique invoices on the wall and a menu, the simplest Ive ever seen that really is just a schedule of courses; soup, fish, entrees, joints, vegetables, savoury, sweets, cheese, dessert and finally coffee. During the years before the Great War, the hotel hosted mostly people connected with horse riding and racing and stables were built for some famous champion horses of the time such as Orange William. The other remarkable fact is that the farm workers were given free accommodation, presumably in lieu of the food they provided directly to the hotel and a good way of keeping them in this vital job, as a hotel without food is, well, not really much of a hotel! Racing was then abolished and the stabling was turned into the cot and crib accommodation rooms, which are on the northwestern hill beside the hotel.
The now 40 bedroom hotel, bought by a syndicate headed by Arthur Ephraums, was managed by the De Zilwa family from 1919 to 1924 when they left to set up their own hotel, only to return again in 1933 after the Great Depression had left the hotel closed. The family bought it and went on to enrich the place for the next 43 years to 1976, working through two generations and having a 60th wedding anniversary, though sadly in Australia where they all ended up living. They provided many facilities and fun things to do for their guests, including a very grand full size 117 year old billiards table from Calcutta that still remains in what was formerly the Dance room fairly central to the hotel, in a magnificent high sided, wood panelled squarish and bright room. We then moved onto the old dining room where Ishanda pointed out to me the extraordinary looking red ceiling, They originally though it was made of copper but no-one seems to know what metal it is actually made from, he tells me.
The hotel played its part in WW2 by looking after oil-soaked British servicemen that were rescued from the Japanese, who sunk their ship HMS Hermes off the east coast of Sri Lanka. Another charitable act carried out by the hotel was performed when the Tamil labourers in Sri Lanka were declared stateless on independence in 1948, forcing the government into the position of processing a mass of applications for citizenship, which they couldnt cope with; a second government office, kachcheri, was set up in the hotel.
The hotel was sold to Gerald Earnstchft Milhuisen, after whom the most deluxe suite in the hotel is named, GEM, who after a further ten years sold it to Jetwing, which has since added a new main kitchen, a fascinating show kitchen, a neat little walk-in wine cellar, another accommodation wing and upgrades to the staff wings, which have helped turn the hotel into the top class five star establishment it is today, along with the visionary practise of training local staff in a special way to run it. I found the staff unfailingly polite yet easy going and in many cases they enhance your experience with their enthusiasm and cheerfulness.
As I say farewell and thank you to Ishanda I walk back down the extended staircase; apparently this was created in the past to accommodate coaches that lacked the horsepower necessary to climb the steep incline; perhaps it is time to roll out Orange William again for old times sake and now that racing is back in fashion and causes the whole town in April to be a total sell out.
I then walk back down the immaculate gardens, pausing to marvel at Dharshan Kumars prowess with topiary; a teacup, a teapot, an elephant, a peacock and even a fisherman fishing out of the pond number amongst his many finer trimmings. As I leave to return to the Cottage by Jetwing I look back longingly at the hotel one more time wishing I could stay much longer, as the light is dimming towards evening before I again get lost in the hustle and bustle of Nuwara Eliya where lots of exciting street food is being sold.

Sri Lanka bolstered by T20 success
PORT ELIZABETH, Thursday: Buoyed by their first success in any series in South Africa, Sri Lanka will go into the first one-day international at St. Georges Park on Saturday with renewed confidence.
On their fifth tour of South Africa, Sri Lanka won their first trophy when they clinched a 2-1 Twenty20 series victory with a five-wicket win in Cape Town on Wednesday.
Its a great confidence booster, said Niroshan Dickwella, the Sri Lankan opening batsman who was named man of the series.
Winning against a big team like South Africa is big. The whole team is backing up our strengths now. We are going to play well in the one-day series as well.
Dickwella identified pitch conditions as the biggest difference in Sri Lankas performances after they were outplayed on seam bowler-friendly conditions in three Test matches.
In this (T20) series, the three wickets were pretty much batting wickets so thats why its easier for us now.
The trend of good batting pitches is likely to continue in the one-day games  but the quality of the South African opposition will be better.
The hosts rested most of their leading players during the T20 series but their big guns will be back in action as they step up their preparations for the Champions Trophy in England in June.
South African coach Russell Domingo said fit-again one-day captain AB de Villiers would slot back into the team at number four in the batting order behind Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock and Faf du Plessis, with JP Duminy and David Miller likely to follow.
Only Miller was in the original T20 squad, although De Villiers made his international return and scored 63 in Wednesdays series decider.
Our top six is pretty established, said Domingo.
We are trying to find our new ball bowling partnerships and our all-rounders to come in at seven and eight. We also want to look at different combinations  whether to go with one spinner or two and also to identify which spinners they are, whether to pick one all-rounder or two or to go with our best possible bowling combination.
The competition for all-rounder places is likely to be intense with Chris Morris coming back after a six-month injury lay-off, while Wayne Parnell, Andile Phehlukwayo and Dwaine Pretorius will all be keen to make a claim.
The main thing ahead of the Champions Trophy is to get everyone playing so we can decide on our best combinations, said Domingo.
Squads:
South Africa (first three matches): AB de Villiers (captain), Hashim Amla, Farhaan Behardien, Quinton de Kock (wkt), JP Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Imran Tahir, David Miller, Chris Morris, Wayne Parnell, Lungi Ngidi, Andile Phehlukwayo, Dwaine Pretorius, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi.
Sri Lanka: Upul Tharanga (captain), Dinesh Chandimal (wkt), Chaturanga de Silva, Dhananjaya de Silva, Thikshila de Silva, Niroshan Dickwella, Asela Gunaratne, Nuwan Kulasekara, Suranga Lakmal, Lahiru Madushanka, Kusal Mendis, Sachith Pathirana, Seekkuge Prasanna, Lakshan Sandakan, Isuru Udana, Sandun Weerakkody.

Sustainable blankets for Emirates flyers
Emirates has introduced new sustainable blankets made from 100 percent recycled plastic bottles. The soft and warm blankets are made using ecoTHREAD patented technology and is now available in Economy Class on all long-haul Emirates flights.
Each Emirates ecoTHREAD blanket is made from 28 recycled plastic bottles. With the latest innovation, the bottles are recycled into plastic chips before being turned into yarn, creating a polar fleece material. The fine thread is then woven into soft blankets.
The environmentally-friendly blankets were designed in partnership with Buzz, the worlds leading inflight product specialists, and are part of Emirates continued commitment to product innovation and sustainability. Emirates already runs a green programme on board recycling aluminum cans, plastic and glass bottles, and clean paper products such as newspapers, magazines and cardboard cartons where possible.
By the end of 2019, Emirates ecoTHREAD blankets would have rescued 88 million plastic bottles from landfills equivalent to the weight of 44 A380 aircraft. This initiative makes it the largest sustainable blanket programme on board in the airline industry. In addition, the manufacturing process of using recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) reduces energy emissions by 70 percent.
ecoTHREAD is certified with the Intertek Green Leaf Mark by third party testing and certification body Intertek, independently verified to use 100% recycled materials.
The Emirates ecoTHREAD blanket for Economy Class completes the recent comforter overhaul across all three classes. The airline introduced a plush, faux sheep-skin blanket in First Class and soft duvets in Business Class.
In the last year, Emirates has added several new products for customers travelling in Economy including the worlds first interactive amenity kits. The amenity kits - filled with necessities such as an eye mask, earplugs, toothbrush and toothpaste, and socks  uses augmented reality technology to unlock entertainment on customers mobile devices using the Blippar app.

Trump seeks Mexican import tax to pay for border wall

President Donald Trump will seek a tax on goods imported from Mexico and use the revenue to build a border wall, the White House spokesman has said.
The plan was announced just after the Mexican president cancelled a visit to Washington, amid a row sparked by the question of who will pay for the wall.
But soon after revealing it, the White House said that was only one option.
Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order to create a wall on the US southern border with Mexico.
Making Mexico foot the bill - which Republicans say could be $12-15bn - was one of his key election campaign pledges.
But President Enrique Pena Nieto has always insisted that will not happen and on Thursday he pulled out of next week's White House meeting.
Hours later, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters the president had discussed the funding proposal with lawmakers, and it could be part of a tax reform package the US Congress is planning.
He said that a 20% tax could generate approximately $10bn (8bn) in tax revenue per year.
"Right now our country's policy is to tax exports and let imports flow freely in, which is ridiculous", Spicer said aboard Air Force One, adding that the tax will "easily pay for the wall".
But Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, later said that the border tax is only one of several options being considered.
Border tax unacceptable - Will Grant, BBC News, Mexico City
President Pena Nieto would have been perceived as very weak if he had travelled to Washington for talks and for many here it would have been tantamount to accepting Trump's central claim - that Mexico will pay for the US border wall.
If that is not up front, then it may come eventually - perhaps under the latest proposal being floated by Donald Trump's White House, a massive 20% border tax on Mexican imports.
As Mexico exports some $300bn of goods a year to the US, the impact of such a proposal would be felt across the country.
Furthermore, the idea of funding a wall through a new tariff is simply unacceptable to most ordinary Mexicans who view the wall as unnecessary, inhumane, expensive and ineffective.
As their elected leader, at least for the next 18 months, Enrique Pena Nieto was left with little option but to deliver that message to the White House - by not going there in person.
The rift between the neighbours and trade partners has deepened just days into Trump's presidency.
After Pena Nieto pulled out of the summit, Trump said the meeting would have been "fruitless" if Mexico didn't treat the US "with respect" and pay for the wall.
Earlier Pena Nieto said he "lamented" the plans for the barrier.
In a televised address, the Mexican leader told the nation: "I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall."
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham warned that US consumers may wind up bearing the cost of the proposed tax.
"Any tariff we can levy they can levy. Huge barrier to econ growth", he wrote online.
"Build that wall" was one of Trump's campaign rally slogans, referring to the construction of a barrier along the 2,000-mile (3,200km) boundary.
As he signed the directive at the Department of Homeland Security, he spoke of a "crisis" on the southern US border.
His executive orders also called for hiring 10,000 immigration officials to help boost border patrol efforts.
"A nation without borders is not a nation," Trump said. "Beginning today the United States gets back control of its borders."

UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri yesterday complained in Parliament that he has been receiving anonymous phone calls asking him to stop questioning the conduct of the Uva Chief Minister and the Uva Provincial Council.
UNP backbencher Wijesiri has been raising question after question about the Uva Chief Minister from the Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister in Parliament in the recent past. The MP also said subject Minister Faiszer Musthapha has also personally asked him not to raise questions about the Uva Chief Minister.
Minister Musthapha was not present in Parliament yesterday to reply to a question by Wijesiri on the Uva Chief Minister and Chief Government Whip, Minister Gayantha Karunathilake replied on his behalf.
MP Wijesiri told Parliament that the Uva Chief Minister has appointed eight advisors even though Chief Ministers could only have one advisor as per a Cabinet decision taken on September 16, 2015.
When I revealed this on the previous occasion former Deputy Minister Priyankara Jayaratne told the House that he instructed to suspend those appointments. The Speaker also expressed his concerns over the matter and requested to look into it. Yet, despite these statements these eight advisors still receive salaries and allowances and two of them receive two salaries from the Provincial Council. As per an audit inquiry, these advisors had also taken part in foreign tours at the cost of Provincial Council funds, he said. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya asked the Chief Government Whip to inform Minister Musthapha to report to Parliament the next day and reply to this question. Had such an incident happened,it is not good and also undermines Parliament. Ask the minister for an explanation in this regard, the Speaker said. MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara intervening at this point said the matter could be probed if it was referred to the Public Accounts Committee.

Usain Bolt Stripped of Gold Medal After Relay Teammate Found Guilty of Doping

Usain Boltis no longer a triple-triple Olympic gold medalist.
Bolt and the Jamaican team have been stripped of their 4x100-meter relay gold medal from the Beijing Games in 2008 because one runner, Nesta Carter, was found guilty of a doping violation,the International Olympic Committee said on Wednesday (25).
Bolt won the 100 meters, the 200 and the 4x100 relay at the last three Summer Olympics, for a total of nine gold medals, tied for the most of any track athlete.
Carter initially tested negative afterthe race in 2008. But his sample wasone of manyretested by the I.O.C. last year. It was found to contain a prohibited stimulant, methylhexaneamine.
Carters lawyer said on Wednesday that he intended to file an appeal of the ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
Olympic officials last year intensified scrutiny of samples from past Olympics after Russia was found to have executedan elaborate, state-supported doping scheme. Dozens of athletes from the Beijing and London Games have been found, upon retesting of their stored samples, to be guilty of doping violations. Many were medalists.
It is standard practice for Olympic officials to store urine samples for up to a decade so they may conduct additional tests, often with more advanced, newly developed techniques.
Carter was also a part of the winning 4x100 relay team in London in 2012, but no announcement about the status of that medal has been made.
The I.O.C. directed the international track federation to modify the results of the 2008 event. Trinidad, Japan and Brazil were second, third and fourth in the race and would each move up a notch. The United States dropped the baton in its heat and did not make the final.
The I.O.C. also told the Jamaican federation to secure the return of the physical gold medals. The other two team members in the final were Asafa Powell and Michael Frater. The Jamaican team finished in 37.10 seconds, which was a world record at the time.
When one member of a team tests positive, it is typical for the entire team to be stripped of its medals, although there have been exceptions. Marion Jones lost two relay medals from 2000 after doping violations, but her teammates were allowed to keep their medals after an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
When news of Carters positive test first emerged last year, Boltsaid, Its heartbreaking because over the years youve worked hard to accumulate gold medals and work hard to be a champion  but its just one of those things.
He added, If I need to give back my gold medal, Id have to give it back; its not a problem for me.
The I.O.C. also announced on Wednesday that Tatiana Lebedeva of Russia was disqualified from the 2008 long jump, in which she won the silver medal, and the triple jump because of a positive test.
Bolt, regarded as the greatest sprinter in history, has said he will retire from the sport after this summers world championships in London.

Venus rises again - five facts on the veteran
MELBOURNE, Thursday: Five facts about American veteran Venus Williams, after she beat Coco Vandeweghe to reach the Australian Open womens final on Thursday:
l At 36, Williams is the oldest Australian Open finalist in the Open era, which began in 1968. Her sister, Serena, holds the record as the tournaments oldest champion, after she won the title in 2015 aged 33 years, 127 days.
l Williams sets a new record for the longest gap between Grand Slam finals of seven-and-a-half years, after her last appearance in the 2009 title match at Wimbledon. Williams has contested 14 Grand Slam finals, winning seven.
l Williams is making her 73rd appearance at a Grand Slam tournament, an Open-era record. She made her major tournament debut at the French Open in 1997, just before her 17th birthday. Williams is also playing the Australian Open for the 17th time, a record she shares with her sister, Serena.
l Williams win ensures that the Australian Open womens final will feature a thirty-something for the fifth year in a row, after Li Na in 2013 and 2014 and Serena Williams in 2015 and 2016. Before 2013, it had been 25 years since the last 30-plus finalist, when Chris Evert was the runner-up aged 33 in 1988.
l Williams was diagnosed with Sjogrens syndrome, a rare, energy-sapping autoimmune disorder, in 2011. She later adopted a vegan and raw foods diet to decrease inflammation in her body. She has also been affected by injuries in recent seasons. AFP

Welcome brew
The picturesque Galle Fort was abuzz with activity as writers, readers and many more flocked to the Fort for five days of books, reading and discussions. This years Fairway Galle Literary Festival saw a host of authors and new additions to the festival. A brand new gastronomic element to this years festival were the Unilever Food Lounge and Lipton Tea Room by Unilever Foods  and both proved to be instant crowd pleasers.
When visitors walked into the Lipton Tea Room at the Fairway Galle Literary Festival, they were greeted by friendly staff and a cool relaxing atmosphere. Beat boxers and entertainers at the venue helped provide a lively atmosphere for festival goers as they nibbled on eats, sipped their tea and sought respite between the literary sessions. Several festival-goers found themselves returning repeatedly to both the Lipton Tea Room and the Unilever Foods Lounge and also enjoying the unique themed food nights - a crowd favourite in the evenings.
Savithri Rodrigo, a regular at the Lounge & Tea Room shared, The Foods Lounge & Lipton Tea Room brought to life a previously dormant space of the festival  such a welcome addition! The food was excellent; compellingly presented and very reasonable. The beanbags & cosy corners were very inviting and I was thoroughly surprised by the guest appearance by Soul Sounds amongst the other live music performances. It was a lovely vibe and such a delightful ambiance that entirely enhanced my festival experience all round.
The Lipton Tea Room brought in a new and playful dimension to tea, with a blend of teas to suit ones mood. The food and teas were harmoniously paired (grilled
Lobster infused with dill, paired with a delicate sun kissed trail tea was a hot seller), luring people back for more.
As the days proceedings wound down and night descended over the Galle Fort, themed nights brought selected dishes to the spotlight at the Food Lounge. I think the themed food nights added an element of spice and excitement to this years Fairway Galle Literary Festival, commented Sashini, a regular at the festival. I was delighted with the Marmite variations  especially the Kottu Night -- the unique flavour of Marmite paired well with the spice of the Kottu. I didnt realize how versatile Marmite could be until I tasted it! The Knorr Roast Paan Night was also an epic and welcome addition to the standard festival food repertoire. There was light acoustic music serenading the guests and it was a perfect night under the stars with good food and a great atmosphere.
Saadia and Ali, a young couple on their honeymoon were recurring visitors and claimed that they fell in love with the Lipton Tea Room. Ali wasnt even a tea drinker but after finding out his favourite blend through the Mood DNA at the Lipton Tea Room he converted to a tea fan! said Saadia.
We absolutely loved experience. We truly felt as if we were home, surrounded by the friendliest people and great food that makes us feel comfortable and we definitely want to return to the festival next year concluded Ali.

Wimal should be labelled as traitor for misusing public funds, property: Bandara
Former Minister Wimal Weerawansa should be labelled as a traitor of the country for allegedly misusing public funds and property, Kurunegala district United National Party (UNP) Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara said.
Speaking at a media briefing at Sirikota, the UNP headquarters yesterday, Bandara said: Former Minister Wimal Weerawansa allegedly misused 90 state vehicles, Rs. 90,000,000 of public funds and also constructed high valued properties using government funds and sold for low prices to his family and relatives.
Referring to the Joint Opposition meeting on January 27, he said: "United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardena says that a crowd of around 500,000 will be present at the meeting. According to Survey Department information, only 80,000 persons can be accompanied in the 19,300 square metre area including the space available on the roads in the Nugegoda junction. We challenge them to bring at least 15,000 for the meeting." Bandara said Weerawansa should be punished for using the national flag inappropriately by displaying it on posters to satisfy his narrow political desires.
He said corruption was common in every government up to a certain extent. The Yahapalanaya regime will take action to minimise corruption as much as possible, Bandara added.
He said loan installments of most of the failed projects of the previous government started in 2015 and the heaviest debt burdens will have to be paid within this period.
Bandara said an internationally accepted vocational and training centre would be established in Kuliyapitiya to educate and provide training for youth regarding vehicle assembly and manufacturing.
