Shortage of officers at NWP Irrigation Department
Most village tanks in the country are situated in Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the North Western Province. However, only 14 technical officers are available with the Department of Irrigation for the supervision of the tanks.
At least about 50 technical officers are required to supervise village tanks, to ensure the safety of forest reserves and to stop unauthorized constructions in and around irrigation systems in the province.
Illegal activities are on the rise nowadays due to the lack of officials at the Irrigation Department.
If the government fails to appoint enough technical officers, the entire population in the province would be affected due to deforestation and vandalism caused by selfish elements, said NWP Irrigation Department Director Malkanthi Thalgodapitiya.

Sinister plan to divide SLFP - WP Chief Minister
The main intention behind bringing former first lady and her two sons before the FCID, CID is to divide the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Shravasthi in Colombo yesterday, he said efforts are being made to divide the SLFP using the issues faced by the Rajapaksa family."Basil Rajapaksa still thinks that he is the current Economic Development Minister and acts like one. It was the UNP which promised people good governance in January 2015, but now it is the SLFP not the UNP that practices it," Devapriya said.
According to the Chief Minister, Buddhasasana and Justice Minister Wijeyedasa Rajapakshe is being criticised because he speaks and acts straight and he did during the previous regime. The Chief Minister said President Maithripala Sirisena can work till 2021.He is people's President and he will fulfil people's wishes. He is clearly practicing good governance.The people have received benefits through this National Government, he added.

Softlogic Holdings recorded a revenue growth of 6.2% posting Rs. 15.2 bn in 1QFY18 from Rs14.3 bn in 1QFY17. The results were resilient despite tightened monetary policy, contracting purchasing power and inclement weather, all contributing to lackluster demand.

The Leisure sector is expected to improve its contribution and reduce its overall losses in the periods to come with Mvenpick Hotels monthly trajectory of occupancy improving as anticipated while intermittent full occupancy in todays context in both hotels, Centara Ceysands Resort and Spa and Mvenpick Hotel Colombo augurs positively for the sector.
Gross Profit improved strongly by 21.2% to Rs. 5.4 billion (Bn) reflecting a GP margin improvement from 31.5% in 1QFY17 to 35.9% in 1QFY18. Group synergies and economies of scale helped profitability.
The Healthcare sector was a key contributor to the Gross Profit growth during the period with increasing demand and bed occupancy in our four hospitals augmenting performance in an unprecedented manner.

Finance Expenses increased 39.6% to Rs. 1.3 Bn during quarter primarily owing to increasing interest rates. Profit before tax improved 8.8% to Rs. 659.6 Mn pushing the profit after taxation for the first three-months of FY2017/18 to Rs. 429.6 Mn after a tax charge of Rs. 230.0 Mn (Rs. 99.1 Mn in 1QFY17).

Sri Lanka Pakistans friend in need: Pakistan envoy
Sri Lanka is Pakistans friend in need, Pakistan acting High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Dr. Sarfraz Ahmed Khan Sipra said.
Dr. Sipra was addressing the launching ceremony of the book, An Enduring Friendship; Sri Lanka and Pakistan, organised by the Pakistan High Commission in Colombo to mark the 70th independence anniversary of Pakistan.
He said Pakistan and Sri Lanka have been linked since ancient times, a link which is 2,300 years old. In 1948, shortly after independence of Sri Lanka, the link was revived and reborn when the founding father of Sri Lanka, Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake travelled to Pakistan to meet the founding father of Pakistan, Quaid i Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
The Acting High Commissioner said the bilateral relationship between Pakistan and Sri Lanka has been an important part of the region. It needs to be studied and evaluated. The book narrates the story of the relationship in an elegant manner, he said.
The author of the book, Arshad Cassim said the book narrates the story of a friendship evolving in a non-military context, following the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka. It explores the potential for greater economic and cultural cooperation, he said.
Editor of the book, Dr. SinhaRaja Tammita Delgoda thanked Government of Pakistan, Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad and the High Commission of Pakistan in Sri Lanka for recognising the value of the initiative. Their interest and support has enabled the project to reach fruition and made the publication possible.
Speaker Karu Jayasooriya who was the Chief Guest at the event said Pakistan and Sri Lanka have a long history of friendly relations. Two countries share commonality of views on a wide range of international and regional issues. Both nations coordinate their positions in multilateral fora and have been helpful to each other during difficult times, he said.
Former Presidents Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Mahinda Rajapaksa, International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, Commerce and Industry Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage, National Integration and Reconciliation State Minister A.H.M. Fowzie, Rehabilitation and Resettlement State Minister M.L.A.M. Hizbullah, Petroleum Resources Development Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage and former Foreign Affairs Minister Prof. G.L.

Tax arrears on Vehicles: Concessionary period granted
The Transport Ministry will declare a three month concessionary period from September to November for arrears payment on annual taxes for luxury, semi-luxury and semi-luxury dual purpose vehicles.
As per the Finance Act No 16 of 1995, an annual tax should be paid by the registered owner of the vehicle for seven years since its initial registration. The first installment of these taxes is charged with the first registration of the vehicle by the Motor Traffic Department.
The remaining installments are charged by the insuring entity when obtaining the annual insurance cover and will be sent to the Treasury.
The Transport Ministry said the total due amount of this tax is above Rs 350 million, even though there is a penalty charge of 50 percent for late payments. Considering that such omissions may be due to reasons beyond the control of vehicle owners, the ministry is declaring this concession while charging only 5 percent of the penalty.

Tax concessions for local entrepreneurs

The Government today rolling out a relief package for local entrepreneurs announced the withdrawal of Telecommunication Levy on Internet data and duty reductions on single cabs, mini trucks and motorcycles below the engine capacity of 150cc. 
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera announced that the 10 percent Telecommunication Levy on Internet data would be completely removed from September 1.
Samaraweera, addressing a press conference at his ministry auditorium along with his Deputy Eran Wickremaratne and Secretary Dr. R H S Samaratunga, said service providing companies had agreed to provide 10 percent additional data to their consumers in response to the Governments move.  
The Budget 2017 proposed to increase the Telecommunication Levy on Internet services from 10 to 25 percent. The Government decided to discard this proposal, the minister explained.
Samaraweera further said that he had on Wednesday (16) signed a Gazette notification granting special concessions for local entrepreneurs to overcome transport difficulties encountered by them.
Accordingly, the minister said the sales price of single cabs and mini trucks would be reduced by Rs 300,000. The excise duty on single cabs and mini trucks has been brought down from Rs 1million to Rs 700,000.  
Ad-valorem excise duty rate of 90 percent has been completely removed for motorcycles less than 150 cc. Duty will apply based on engine capacity. Samaraweera predicted substantial price reduction would happen, particularly for Japanese motorcycles.
The Government expects a new breed of entrepreneurs to boost local production. Sri Lanka is doing well amidst extreme weather conditions and unfavourable global economic conditions. This was also stated by the IMF and World Bank in their reports. We hope the newly announced duty revisions will add impetus to our economic growth, the Minister noted.
The minister also unveiled eight loan schemes with concessionary interest rates for several selected sectors based on a budgetary proposal for the year 2017.
Among them are Ran Aswenna and Govi Navoda loan schemes for those involved in the agricultural sector, Riya Shakthi loan scheme for those involved in school transport service, Rivi Bala Savi loan scheme for the promotion of solar power, Diri Saviya loan scheme for those involved in poultry farming, Jaya Isura loan scheme for those in the SME sector, Madya Aruna loan scheme for journalists and Sonduru Piyasa housing loan scheme for low income families.
The Government has set aside Rs 4.4 billion this year for interest subsidies of these loan schemes. We expect about 50,000 new employment opportunities by providing these incentives, the minister added.
The Governments special announcement coincided with the two years completion of the unity Government formed following the General Elections on August 17, 2015.
Two years ago, people voted us into power to put a full stop to crony capitalism and drive the countrys economy towards the path of social market economy. We are gradually delivering on our promise and the foundation for a strong economy is being laid, the Minister commented.

Tharanga pleads for patience

A day after Sri Lankas Test captain Dinesh Chandimal apologized for a 3-0 series whitewash against India, limited-over captain Upul Tharanga has asked fans for patience ahead of their upcoming ODIs and Twenty20 matches.
Sri Lanka failed to challenge the worlds top-ranked Test side during the three-match series and the gulf in quality between the two sides was clearly visible.
They also suffered their maiden One-Day International series loss to Zimbabwe last month, prompting long-serving captain Angelo Mathews to step down.
Sri Lanka next plays five ODIs and a Twenty20 against the Virat Kohli-led India, starting Sunday, which will be Tharangas first as full-time captain.
Every team goes through a rough patch, Tharanga said in a statement from Sri Lanka Cricket. This is something that happens in cycles to every team and every nation no matter how great a cricketing nation they are.
Sri Lanka dominated in all three formats for a good 18 years  dont forget this now when we are going through a rough patch.
The 32-year-old said the 1996 World Cup winners had already identified areas for improvement.
These areas are being taken care of, and we are seeing the results behind the scenes  however it will take a little more time for it to be seen externally, so please have patience, and most importantly have faith, Tharanga said.
Sri Lanka has recalled all-rounders Thisara Perera and Milinda Siriwardana to its limited-over squad and Tharanga was confident of defeating India.
Sri Lanka have always been stronger in our white-ball format, and I am confident that we will come out strong and beat India, he said.
We have the talent, we have the skill. We have been putting in the hard work, we just need the spirit, and for that we need your support too.
Squad:
Upul Tharanga (captain), Angelo Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella (wicketkeeper), Dhanushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Chamara Kapugedera, Milinda Siriwardana, Malinda Pushpakumara, Akila Dananjaya, Lakshan Sandakan, Thisara Perera, Wanindu Hasaranga, Lasith Malinga, Dushmantha Chameera and Vishwa Fernando.

Default taxes hampering Development Lotteries Boards progress
The Development Lotteries Board is facing a major financial issue with the nonpayment of Rs. 2.5 billion in default taxes by the administrators of the previous government.
Chairman, CEO Romesh Jayawardhana speaking to Daily News Business said that profits from the Development Lottery are credited to the Presidents Fund and Mahapola Scholarship Fund enabling many students to achieve higher education.
However due to the payment and settlement towards this debt we are compelled to cut down on our contribution for this national cause. He said that with prudent economic management they will be able to pay back Rs. 1.4 billion back to the government by end of November 2017.
He said that there revenue increased by 24% in 2016 from 15% in 2015. However we will not be able to better this due to these default taxes in 2107, he said. He also said that the strike action by vendors this year due to the lowering of agents commission also would have a negative impact for their bottom line this year.
Jayawardhana said that they will introduce novel marketing tools and launching innovative ways to satisfy customers.

Even the largest airplanes can now safely land at BIA
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said that the landing of the Emirates Airbus A380 aircraft at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) signified the fact that even the largest airplanes in the world can now safely land at the newly reconstructed runaway of BIA without any problem.
He made these remarks participating in a welcoming ceremony for one of the worlds largest aircrafts, Emirates Airbus A380, with a seat capacity of 550 held at the BIA recently.
The aircraft, flown by Sri Lankan Pilot Udaya Tilakaratna, arrived at the airport with 524 passengers on board.
He said that many people, including certain politicians predicted that the A380 aircrafts cannot land at BIA even after the resurfacing of the runway at a cost of Rs. 7.2 billion after 30 years. They said that the money spent for this project had gone down the drain.
Several media reports had also claimed that this project was not up to international standards; that the largest of aircrafts would be unable to access this newly modernized runway. However, all these predictions had now been proven false after the landing of the Emirates A380 aircraft.
Pessimists will say various things about our service, but we not be shaken, he added.
Plans are afoot to launch massive development activities to upgrade the facilities of the BIA. Tenders have already been called for the construction of a second international terminal as well.
The management of Emirates had agreed to fly once a month between Dubai and Sri Lanka and it will pave the way to attract more tourists to the island.
He further added that the Government is keen to popularize Mattala airport among the international passengers by upgrading its facilities. We also had discussions with Indian investors to attract more airlines from all over the world to Mattala, he said.

Multi-millionaire ex - ministers unable to show how they earned
Most Members of Parliament, after becoming ministers, serve themselves and their families forgetting the people who elected them. Some ministers of the previous regime who remain defeated are multi-millionaires. They find it impossible to show how they obtained such colossal sums of money to become owners of palatial buildings, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing a meeting at Badagiriya Hambantota after inaugurating the construction work of the road that leads to the fisheries harbour and awarding of housing loans to low income group fisher folk at Badagiriya.
The minister said when the members of the previous regime were questioned by the CID and other authorities, they said that these palatial buildings are not their properties. This was the type of ministers we had during the previous regime. These politicians are a shame to other politicians who perform their duties with trust and confidence, the minister said.
Today when an allegation is directed against ministers, they do not hesitate to resign from the ministerial posts. But such things never happened during the previous regime, added the minister.
He said after COPE investigations, a large number of State sector officials were found guilty but none of them were punished according to the rules and regulations of the country.

AIA Sri Lanka reports solid half year results
AIA Insurance Lanka PLCs consolidated revenue has increased 28 per cent for the six months ended 30 June 2017 from the same period last year to Rs 8,765 million, driven by gross written premium (GWP) growth of 14 per cent to Rs 5,532 million. The growth in GWP was mainly attributed to growth in renewal business.
Conventional life GWP increased 17 per cent from the same period last year, to Rs 5,115 million. Investment income went up 15 per cent from the same period last year, to Rs 2,636 million, benefitting from prudent investments made by the Company and the increase in interest rates.
Consolidated profit after tax amounted to Rs 135 million, an increase of 13 per cent compared with the same period last year. The surplus of the life insurance business is reported annually at the year end and is therefore not included in the half-year profit.
Pankaj Banerjee, Chief Executive Officer of AIA Sri Lanka, said, AIA Sri Lankas consolidated revenue was boosted by a solid 28 per cent compared with last year. AIA remains committed to growing our business both quantitatively and qualitatively and the execution of our growth strategy has reflected this. We are focused on ensuring that we continuously improve the customer experience.
The investments we have made in our agency force through our Premier Agency strategy to equip our Wealth Planners with the best in training and technology have set AIA apart from the competition when it comes to serving our customers long-term savings and protection needs.
William Lisle, Chairman of AIA Sri Lanka, said, I am very pleased that AIA Sri Lanka had a strong first half in 2017.
Our initiatives under Premier Agency Strategy and Bancassurance partnerships are showing excellent results and we are confident that AIA Sri Lanka is well positioned to benefit from the growth momentum of the Sri Lankan life insurance market.

Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne said even if the elections were delayed it will be delayed only for six to seven months but in future Provincial Council elections will be held under a proper system. Not only United National Party (UNP) and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) but all parties including Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) wanted a new constitution and finally it is only former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is standing on the opposite side of the fence, he said.

Battaramulle Seelaratana Thera's writ petition fixed for support

The Court of Appeal has held that a writ petition filed by Ven. Battaramulle Seelaratana Thera seeking an order preventing authorities from taking further steps in the procurement process relating to the development of a 300 MW combined cycle power plant at Kerawalapitiya cannot be dismissed in limine. 
Therefore, Court of Appeal (President) L.T.B. Dehideniya fixed the matter for support for notice.
 President's Counsel Rumesh de Silva with Counsel Harith de Mel and S.V. Niles instructed by D. Vidanapathirana appearing for the 30th Respondent raised a preliminary objection that the application cannot be maintained on the basis that the prayers to the petition are not maintainable.
 However,Counsel Pradeep Kumarasinghe appearing for the Petitioner submitted that he is not proceeding with the prayers (h), (i) and (G) where the Petitioner was seeking for injunctions and enjoining order, but he will be proceeding with the other prayers.
 The petitioner stated that Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has invited interested local and foreign companies to submit proposals for the previously mentioned project. "Therefore initially over 30 interested companies have obtained the Request for Proposal from CEB. However, only eight bidders have submitted proposal when the deadline for submissions expired on April 21, 2017," the petitioner added.
The petitioner further stated that among over thirty interested parties only eight bidders submitted proposals which would ultimately minimize the competitiveness for an enormous project.
The petitioner further said that the CEB as the procurement entity has personal interest in the procurement process that will have a huge impact on the transparency of the procurement procedure.
The petitioner cited CEB, members of National Procurement Commission, the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy and several others as respondents.
 This petition was filed through Counsel Pradeep Kumarasinghe under the instructions of Pradeep Associates.

BIA runway witnesses brand new outlook with A380
Sri Lanka's Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) welcomed an Emirates A380 aircraft making a one off landing, symbolizing Sri Lanka and AASL to achieve an aviation milestone.
On March 18, BIA runway witnessed its brand new outlook since its establishment thirty years ago. The runway overlay works were completed successfully ahead of schedule by China National Aero-Technology International Engineering Corporation (CATIC-ENG). While as the schedule, the runway overlay works will be completed within 90 days till 06th April 2017.
Arranged to celebrate the BIA's resurfaced and upgraded runway, the special one-off A380 flight operated as EK654 from Dubai, replacing the B777 aircraft usually deployed by Emirates on flights to Sri Lanka.
Transport and Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said the arrival of the aircraft marked a great occasion for Sri Lanka as it entered a new era of air connectivity. Ahmed Khoory of Emirates said that for BIA, this event signals that it is A380 ready,'.
There were a lot of criticism when BIA's runway was resurfaced and doubts about whether it could handle A380s. The successful landing of Emirates A380 aircraft at BIA today had dismissed the doubts and smashed the rumors.
Given the Sri Lanka government's focus on developing tourism, this is an important development for local aviation enthusiasts and is a matter of pride that the airport has joined the ranks of leading international airports in the A380 league after the BIA runway being resurfaced with a full LED navigation lighting system. The effort made by AASL and Chinese Contractor CATIC-ENG to achieve the success of runway upgrading and resurfacing will be a great contribution to people of the Sri Lanka and its sustainable development.

CNCI ACHIEVER Awards today at Galadari
The CNCI Achiever Awards event which is annually organized by the Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI), the premier Industrial Chamber in the country recognizes and rewards the Sri Lankan industrialists for their achievements and excellence displayed both in the manufacturing and service sectors.
In 2017, the CNCI Achiever Awards competition is being held for the 16th consecutive year today at Hotel Galadari. The event in total is a comprehensive process. The Achiever Awards 2017 event was launched in the month of February and the applications were closed in 31st May 2017 and then the evaluation process was soon started. The evaluation of applications basically has three stages. First is the Auditing Process. Each and every application received were scrutinized by a reputed audit firm to ensure that the financial figures presented and the general data submitted were in order. Any observations made by the Auditors had to be clarified by the applicants. Thereafter, the internal judging process, where the applications were evaluated by an internal panel of judges consisting of Chartered Accountants, Engineers, Management Specialists. Interviewing the contestants and company visits of short listed companies were also taken place at that state. Finally the evaluation of applications by the External Panel of Judges, which was Headed by Professor Sampath Amarathunge, Vice Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayawardenapura.
The evaluation was made on number of criteria encompassing Turnover, Value Addition, Productivity and Responsibilities towards employees, Growth and Future, Corporate Plans, R & D, Quality Assurance, Environmental Responsibilities, Health and Safety and Social Responsibility etc.
CNCI in its quest to make the industries globally competitive considers this contest as a tool to encourage our industrialists. Thus every year new factors are brought into the evaluation enhancing the benchmark levels. CNCI Achiever is a highly popular event among the industrialists mainly due to its stringent evaluation process and independent selection process of unbiased nature. For all quantifiable figures, the marks are assigned by a special computer package designed for the purpose.
One significant feature observed in this year was the largest number of applications received in the Extra Large category for both Government and Private sector industries. This we consider as a novel trend where some public sector industries have been confident enough to complete with the private sector industries in terms of operational excellence.
Bank of Ceylon has been the principal sponsor in this year for the event who has been sponsoring the event for the last 11 years.
Ceylinco General Insurance Ltd (sponsoring for the last nine years) and Litro Gas Lanka Ltd have been co-sponsors while ITN and Lake House have been Media Sponsors. Sampath Bank, Peoples Leasing & Finance and National Savings Bank have been event sponsors.

Colombo among five biggest improved cities - Global Livability Report
The City of Colombo has been selected among the five biggest improved cities during the last five years in terms of livability by the Global Livability Report 2017. Out of 140 cities, Colombo is ranked at 124th with an overall rating of 51 out of 100 points.
The Economist Intelligence Unit says that Colombo has showed relative improvement during this period, especially after the end of a separatist war.
On the flip side, however, cities moving up the ranking are located largely in countries that have enjoyed periods of relative stability after previously reported falls in livability. These include, for example, Kiev in Ukraine, Tripoli in Libya and Colombo in Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, the improvements have been marginal and have not seen livability recover from previous levels or resulted in large shifts up the ranking. Amsterdam, Reykjavik, Budapest, Singapore and Montevideo are among those that have seen both their ranks improve.
In total, there are 12 cities with scores that have improved over the past 12 months, up from seven. The ongoing weakening of global stability scores has been made uncomfortably apparent by a number of high-profile incidents that have shown no signs of slowing in recent years. Violent acts of terrorism have been reported in many countries, including Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, France, Pakistan, Sweden, Turkey, the UK and the US. While not a new phenomenon, the frequency and spread of terrorism have increased noticeably and become even more prominent.
Over the past few years several US cities have registered declines in their scores. This stems in part from unrest related to a number of deaths of black people at the hands of police officers. In addition, the country has seen protests held in response to President Trumps policies and executive orders.
Sydney in Australia is another city that has seen a decline in its ranking, reflecting growing concerns over possible terror attacks in the past three years. For the seventh consecutive year, Melbourne in Australia is the most livable urban centre of the 140 cities surveyed, closely followed by the Austrian capital, Vienna. In fact, only 0.1 percentage points separate the top two cities, and just 0.2 and 0.3 percentage points separate Canadas Vancouver and Toronto (ranked 3rd and 4th, respectively), from Melbourne.
Another Canadian city, Calgary, shares joint fifth place with Adelaide in Australia. The Economist Intelligence Unit (The EIU) is the research and analysis division of The Economist Group, the sister company to The Economist newspaper.

Creative Software expands to support IT sector growth
Only months after moving into their modern eight-storey R&D centre in the heart of Colombo, leading software company Creative Software is at risk of outgrowing their premises yet again.
Creative Software Director Sushena Ranatungas said Problems caused by growth are always good problems to have. Last year we almost doubled our office space to accommodate our growing teams. Soon we might be finding ourselves in the same situation again and while the thought of moving is daunting, we are incredibly happy with the steady progress weve been making in the past years.
Fueling Creative Softwares expansion is the companys ever growing international client base. Creative Software speacializes in building dedicated teams of software engineers who have been developing and maintaining industry-leading software solutions for companies around the world since 1999.
According to Ranatunga, the increase in demand for Creative Softwares services and engineers is an indicator of the strength of Sri Lankas software industry itself.
We see an increase in international clients confidence in investing in Sri Lanka, explained Ranatunga. There are many factors behind this, but I believe the main driver for our growth is the increasing quality of our IT talent and maturity of our IT industry.
Ranatunga also observed an important change in the local market for IT services statingthat Sri Lankas leading organizations are increasing their investment in IT.
There is a great gap between business and IT  we are all aware of it, said Ranatunga. However, Sri Lankas leading companies have realized the urgency of bridging that gap.
Creative Software has been working with several such companies and together we are building really innovative solutions in areas like Big Data and IoT.
While many gaps in Sri Lankas IT industry remain to be bridged, the future is by no means bleak. Companies like Creative Software continue to work hard towards establishing Sri Lanka on the global IT scene, attracting foreign investment, as well as creating a healthy competition that propels the whole industry forward.
Most importantly, the increasing strength of the local IT sector has created a wealth of job opportunities and will continue to do so.
Creative Software will have many job openings for both entry level and experienced professionals throughout the year, announced Ranatunga.

Drought  resistant Soya to be promoted in Apura
The government will expand Soya bean cultivation in the country with priority given to the Anuradhapura district on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The official in charge of Soya crop at the Agriculture Department and Assistant Director Buddhika Abesinghe told the Daily News that among other crops Soya was the one which could survive and thrive during severe drought.
According to him, Soya required comparably less fertilizer, less water and less care.
Soya cultivation in the Yala season has been a success despite the drought. Also in the 2016/2017 Maha Season, farmers in the Mahaweli H Zone were able to produce 300,000 kilograms of Soya, adequate to fulfill the Soya seed requirement for the next seasons.
Although we planned to cultivate Soya in 25,000 hectares in the country during the Yala season, the lack of rain confined it only to 4,300 hectares in the Mahaweli H Zone, Huruluwewa in the Anuradhapura district and to 2,200 hectares in the Ampara, Kurunegala, Polonnaruwa, Moneragala and Vavuniya districts, Abesinghe said.
He added that from the 2017 Yala season cultivation, a harvest of 12,500 MT is expected, which is sufficient to cover the local consumption. He said by 2020, the national Soya requirement could be produced in the country.

HSBC, IBM develop cognitive intelligence solution to digitise global trade
HSBC, the worlds leading trade finance bank, is working with IBM to develop a cognitive intelligence solution combining optical character recognition with advanced robotics to make global trade safer and more efficient for thousands of businesses.
HSBCs Global Trade and Receivables Finance (GTRF) team facilitates over USD500 billion of documentary trade for customers every year, and in doing so must manually review and process up to 100 million pages of documents, ranging from invoices to packing lists and insurance certificates. The new solution uses IBMs advanced analytics technology, including intelligent segmentation and text analytics, to identify, digitise and extract key data within these documents before feeding it into the banks transaction processing systems; boosting accuracy whilst freeing up staff for more value-adding activities.
The average trade transaction requires 65 data fields to be extracted from 15 different documents, with 40 pages to be reviewed, said Natalie Blyth, HSBCs Global Head of GTRF. By digitising this process we will make transactions quicker and safer for both buyers and suppliers, leading our industry forwards, and we will reduce compliance risks through an enhanced ability to manage huge volumes of data.
The problem is how to capture semi-structured documents with highly variant content through an analogue process, and no-one has the perfect answer, said Roger Welch, Industry (Financial) Expert and Solution Architect for IBM Analytics ECM practice. In our experience, no trade finance solution has come as far or done as much as this new solution.
HSBC is currently using the technology to analyse English-language import and export bills in several markets in Asia, Europe, the Americas and the MENA region. The team aims to enhance the solution so it can read a wider range of documents and languages including French, Spanish and Chinese.
We are continuously investing in technologies that will improve the way we work for the benefit of our customers and our people, said Natalie Blyth. HSBC wants to be the leading bank for innovation, and initiatives like this one are key to achieving our goal.

Illegally acquired assets worth over US $30 m seized : Mangala
Result of corruption probes against Rajapaksas family and close relatives:
As a result of fraud and corruption probes against former President Mahinda Rajapaksas family and close relatives, illegally acquired assets worth over US $30 million have been taken into the custody of Courts or the Government so far, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said in a statement yesterday.
He also noted in the statement that the time was ripe for Kurunegala district MP Rajapaksa, the only President to have vacated office after been defeated by the public due to his corrupt rule, to think how unbefitting it is for a President who ruled the country for two terms to continue in his devious ways with the ulterior motive of exacting revenge on the people who brought his downfall.
The minister questioned whether Rajapaksa who issued a statement noting that the manner in which the Government privatised the Hambantota Port has shocked the nation had forgotten that during his rule, state assets were sold outright to foreigners.
The minister also questioned what Rajapaksa had to say about leasing a terminal of the Colombo Port in a 85%-15% agreement to China in 2014. The minister said if the Rajapaksa agreement to lease the Hambantota port had prevailed, the Ports Authority would have had to invest an amount exceeding 350 million dollars to improve the port while paying for the loan obtained to construct it.
He also said the Ports Authority is currently spending Rs. 9000 million on the Hambantota Port annually, which would rise to Rs. 17,360 million by 2019. Minister Samaraweera also states that Rajapaksas attempt to define Hambantota Port development to be a privatisation and a selling of the countrys resources, goes to show Rajapaksas political hypocrisy.
The statement also said that when Rajapaksa left, he inherited a land burdened by ethnic and religious unrest, volumes of national debt and human rights violations. Fianance Minister Samaraweera also points out Sri Lanka will be facing a large debt crisis in 2019, owing to the unmanaged debt raising of previous government. According to the minister, the debt crisis will occur following a series of sovereign bonds maturing on in 2019 for which Sri Lanka must pay 4200 US dollars.
Minister Samaraweera points out that Rajapaksa is acting against his own people and his country by alarming the public with spreading false fears on constitutional reforsm and other development projects carried out by the government.
Minister Samaraweera expresses his confidence that people of the country will not be deceived by Rajapaksas well staged dramas as a cover up to his corruptions, scams and crimes happened during his regime.

While offering the foremost place to Buddhism, the government is taking measures to protect other religions. When all religions work in unity and collaboration, extremism gets eliminated. Even Emperor Asoka through his inscription has exhorted people to respect all religions in keeping with Buddhism, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister made these observations addressing a meeting at Temple Trees, on Tuesday to mark the distribution of financial assistance among 150 temples towards archaeological conservation and development work.
The Prime Minister said ancient Buddhist temples and Raja Maha Viharayas were significant places connected to the Sinhala Buddhist heritage. Some of these temples had murals dating back to Sinhala kings ranging from king Devanampiyatissa to Sri Wickrema Rajasinghe.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam is taking measures to assist the conservation of ancient temples, he said.
We should strive to protect the archaeological heritage and national culture. The Central Culture Fund is assisting the development and conservation of ancient temples as they lack sufficient funds for the exercise, the Prime Minister said.
It was to carry forward this work that they formed a national government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena. While forging religious amity and reconciliation, the government was trying to protect and conserve the Buddhist heritage, he said.
The President helped these efforts with enthusiasm, he said.
Sri Lanka occupies a prominent place for protecting Theravada Buddhism and spreading it to South East Asia, including Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, he said.
The Prime Minister said the government launched programmes to develop temples and Dagabas in the country. Work on the Maha Viharaya has been entrusted with the Archaeological Department and the Central Cultural Fund.
The government will assist conservation work in Kapilavastu and Lumbini in consultation with the government of Nepal. Steps would be taken to renovate and rehabilitate the Sri Dalada Maligawa, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.

JKOA launches SAP Hybris Cloud for service
Leading office automation solutions provider John Keells Office Automation (JKOA) launched the SAP Hybris Cloud for Service customer support module recently at its Colombo headquarters.
The module is the result of an agreement signed between JKOA and SAP Hybris in a move that will significantly enhance the JKOA customer experience by enabling real-time interaction between clients and after-sales service providers.
The launch was attended by senior management from JKOA, SGIT (JKOAs strategic SAP partner) and Itellegence (JKOAs implementation partner).
SAP Hybris Cloud for Service has been recognized globally for its functionality, user-friendliness and reporting mechanisms. With this portal, JKOA is opening up its customer support operations to the end user who then has the ability to engage in real time with the seller for the services they require.
This self-service system equips the JKOA customer with the right tools they need to manage their requests, while also allowing them to track repair status and other information on their product, eliminating the usual wait times and dependency on call centers.
Customers want convenience and reliability because their daily business operations depend on the functionality of these products and thats exactly what the SAP system is enabling, noted Malik Edwin, Head of Marketing and Business Development JKOA/ AVP John Keells Group. We have been looking for means to enhance their user experience and this certainly addresses a gap in the market. Its also a very effective way for our service providers to extend their services from anywhere in the island.
The system tracks availability of field engineers based on territory and assigns the closest engineer to the customer, thereby reducing wait time. Automated billing will also ensure that the job is completed quickly. For the customer, the system will include an automated breakdown assignment option, on-field estimates, repair tracking systems and social media integration.
This social media integration will allow customers to track jobs, provide feedback and monitor progress in real time with remarkable ease.
In addition, the system is integrated with advanced software such as Paper Cut for solutions and preventive maintenance, leading to the lowest down time on machines. The app developed as part of the system can create onsite estimates, and provide immediate real-time access to inventory with immediate customer approvals and repairs.
JKOA has already tested the SAP Hybris Cloud for Service customer support module and recorded significant improvements in efficiency and effectively. We were pleased to note that the system delivers on all its promises, said Mr Malik Edwin. We have no doubt that the launch of this system will revolutionize the landscape for after-sales services in Sri Lanka.
JKOA is a fully owned subsidiary of John Keells Holdings PLC, a leading conglomerate in Sri Lanka.

Laugfs Gas negotiates price revisions
Laugfs Gas is in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities to ensure that LPG retail prices are in line with global LPG market prices. This is to enable that the companys main source of revenue is secured.
Whilst investments made in some areas such as renewable energy sector are already yielding profits, certain other long term investments will be of longer gestation periods, K. H. Wegapitiya, Chairman and Group CEO said. This coupled with the companys core business of LPG downstream activities having to continue under the prevailing retail price restrictions whilst LPG prices in the global market are surging.
This has resulted in the finances for this quarter recording a loss after tax Rs 508 million.
We are confident that we will receive a positive response in this regard very soon. In addition to the aforementioned, the company is also pursuing strategic partnerships in to enhance funding and create requisite marketing channels and opportunities which will no doubt bring in the expected returns in the years to come.

Manufacturing activities expand in July
The Manufacturing Sector PMI recorded 54.3 in July which is a decrease of 1.8 index points compared to June 2017.
This indicates that the manufacturing activities expanded, albeit at a slower rate in July 2017, mainly driven by the decrease in the stock of purchases sub-index resulting from the usage of excess stock that was built up in the previous month and decrease in the Employment sub-index due to the difficulties in replacing unskilled employees to account for high labour turnover.
New orders and suppliers delivery time sub-indices moderated during the month while Production sub-index remained at the same level. However, all the sub-indices of PMI recorded values above the neutral 50 threshold signalling an overall expansion in July.
Moreover, the expectation for activities indicates an improvement for the next three months.
The Services Sector PMI recorded 59.1 index points in July from 59.2 index points in June 2017. This indicates that the Services sector continued to expand in July 2017 driven by Business Activity and employment sub-indices albeit with a marginal deceleration compared to June 2017. Backlogs of Work also declined, compared to June 2017. Financial sector contributed to the expansion in new businesses through introduction, expansion of technological reach to serve their clients and to improve efficiency of their services. Further, an increase in business activity was observed, mainly in the accommodation, food and beverage sector due to increase in tourist arrivals and positive expectations for next 3 months.
Prices Charged index experienced a decline in July compared to June 2017 in the absence of any festival demand. However, National Transport Commission increased the bus fare by 6.28% as per the annual bus fare revision. Meanwhile, Expectations on Labour Cost index declined in July 2017.

Mendis and Company directed to handover audited accounts
Palisena asked to disclose money trail for Rs 712 million:
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue yesterday questioned Perpetual Treasuries Limited Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena on Rs 712 million worth dividends paid by his company to Perpetual Asset Management, a 100% shareholding company of PTL.
According to the evidence led before the PCoI yesterday, Perpetual Treasuries Limited pays 100% dividends to Perpetual Holdings and Perpetual Asset Management (PAM). From 2014 to 2016, the payment of dividends amounted to Rs 700 million plus. Evidence regarding PTL dividend payments surfaced as Commissioner, Supreme Court Judge Prasanna Jayawardena questioned Palisena as to who the owners of the Perpetual Treasuries Limited are.
According to the evidence led, within the web of companies where full ownership of the PTL is with PAM, the 100% PAM ownership is with Perpetual Capital Holdings (PCH). 100% ownership of the PCH is with Perpetual Capital, which is owned by Geoffrey Aloysius and his son Arjun Aloysius.
Justice Jayawardena then put a question to the witness asking as to where the trail of money ended up at. Palisena came up with an I dont know, to which Justice Jayawardena said there is no way that Palisena would not know about that. Justice Jayawardena also asked isnt Palisena a non-executive director at Perpetual Assets Management as well. Palisena did mention a purchasing of bank shares with the payments, but the answer was not confirmed or clear.
Palisena agreed to provide necessary information regarding the matter raised.
The PCoI reminded Palisena that it can trace these transactions itself but said the commission will hold Palisena responsible to provide correct and comprehensive information on the matter.
Meanwhile, Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera informed Palisena to be careful with the tone of his voice with which he testifies before the PCoI.
The concern was raised by SASG Livera when Palisena was grilled on the PTLs call recordings system, third time this week.
Palisena informed the PCoI that they are not able to provide call recordings corresponding to specific transactions like Bank of Ceylon, Pan Asia Banking Corporation and DFCC.
Justice Jayawardena following Liveras caution reminded Palisena that he is under oath and legal action is a possibility if he makes false statements.
Palisena informed the PCoI that he checked into the call recording system in the morning. He also said that when PTL receives a call, it is recorded as a missed call and an outgoing call can be identified as it is.
Asked as to from whom PTL purchased the telephone call recording system, Palisena told the PCoI that they got it from Metropolitan Technologies.
He was then questioned if PTL customised the system when they purchased it. Palisena said he needs to check it with his IT section.
Meanwhile, Presidents Counsel Anuja Premarathne requested the PCoI a time extension to provide details on W.M. Mendis and Company.
The PCo requested W.M. Mendis and Company to handover its audited accounts, bank statements and other relevant documentation from 2013 to 2017 for probing, on August 8, 2017.
The PCoI observed that W.M. Mendis and Company must have maintained audited accounts.

Migrant crisis: Spain rescues 600 people in busiest day

Spain's coastguard says it has rescued 600 migrants crossing from Morocco in a 24-hour period amid a spike in the number of migrant arrivals.
The rescued migrants were in 15 vessels including toy paddleboats and a jet ski and included 35 children and a baby.
The UN says more than 9,000 people have arrived in Spain so far this year - three times as many as the previous year.
More than 120 people are believed to have drowned attempting the crossing.
The increase in crossings means Spain could overtake Greece this year in the number of migrants arriving by sea, the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) said earlier this month.
Most are sailing across the 12km (seven-mile) Strait of Gibraltar and many are choosing cheap, child-sized paddle boats without motors that allow them to bypass people smuggling networks and their fees.
Some migrants are using social media to contact the Spanish authorities and inform them of their location once they are in territorial waters, the BBC's Gavin Lee in the Spanish city of Tarifa says.
However, a much larger number - nearly 100,000 - have crossed from Libya to Italy since the start of the year. The IOM says 2,242 people have died on that route.
In June, about 5,000 people were rescued in one day in the Mediterranean off Libya, Italian coastguards said.
The number of migrants arriving in Spain by sea does not include those entering the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in north Africa, which are the EU's only land borders with Africa.

More courts to expedite mega corruption cases
Govt moves to prosecute big fish:
The government seeks the establishment of more High Courts to clear the unacceptably long delays in bringing to justice those responsible for huge corruption, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne announced yesterday.
He said the Cabinet of Ministers discussed the inordinate delays in prosecuting members of the former regime for plundering national wealth and decided there should more high courts as well as trials-at-bar.
The minister said there was no bar to increasing the number of court houses by one or two at least and there were provisions for the Attorney Generals Department to hire private lawyers to handle the extra case load.
We have taken a firm decision that these (pending) inquiries should now result in prosecutions, the minister told the weekly press briefing that follows Tuesdays cabinet meeting. There can be no excuse for delays.
He said constituents were constantly pressing for action against members of the former Rajapaksa regime who were yet to be prosecuted for huge corruption between 2005 and 2015.
We are told that on average it takes 10 years and two months to conclude a case in the normal course of events in this country,  the minister said.
If we have Trials-at-Bar, then the time can be reduced to about a year.
When Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe attended religious ceremonies at the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy last week, devotees asked him when the government would prosecute high profile crooks, the minister said. Co-Cabinet spokesman and Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said the government would request the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General to consider setting up the additional courts at the earliest.
The two ministers said the courts could even have two sessions a day to speed up cases. Minister Senaratne said 101 cases relating to fraud and corruption allegedly committed by those linked to the former president and his regime were yet to be brought to court.
Eighty seven case files had been sent to the Attorney General by the Financial Crimes Investigation Department (FCID) and 14 from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

Slander and defamation are not issues:
President Maithripala Sirisena said baseless slander and defamation are not issues for him during his journey towards making a better future for the country and the people. He was speaking at a religious ceremony to unveil the marble Buddha statue at the Sri Dharma Vijayaloka Maha Viharaya in Pannipitiya on Tuesday. The Buddha statue has been brought from Myanmar to Sri Dharma Vijayaloka Maha Viharaya.
Even the Buddha was insulted during that time. There is no wonder that I also face insults and slander in this society, which is deteriorating due to commercialization, he said.
The President recalled that Mahathma Gandhi who was leading the struggle for freedom in neighbouring Maha Bharatha as well as Srimath S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, a pioneer political leader in this country, were also insulted.
He pointed out that today, modern technology is used for disgracing people rather than using it for gaining knowledge, social development or building a better society. He said the young generation should be spiritually developed in order to save them from this harmful social condition.
The President, who laid a floral tribute to the Buddha statue, opened it for worship of the people.
Chief Incumbent of the Vipassana Meditation Centre in Yangon, Myanmar Ven. Badantha Saddhamakiththisara Thera presented a souvenir to the President at this occasion.

Philippine police kill 32 drug suspects in one day

Police killed at least 32 suspected drug offenders in a series of raids near Manila, in the bloodiest night of Philippine PresidentRodrigo Duterte's war on drugs.
Senior Superintendent Romeo M. Caramat Jr. said 67 operations in various parts of Bulacan province Tuesday saw police kill dozens, while 109 others were arrested.
Police also claimed to have seized more than 200 grams of methamphetamine, 786 grams of cannabis, assorted firearms, grenades and ammunition.
Bulacan, a province of about 3.29 million people, has recorded numerous arrests and killings of drug suspects in recent months, police records showed.
Duterte has vowed to protect police who kill drug suspects under suspicious circumstances.
Government figures show that since Duterte took office last year up to July 26, more than 3,000 "drug personalities" have been killed in gun battles with police.
More than 2,000 others died in drug-related homicides, including attacks by motorcycle-riding masked gunmen and other assaults. Human rights groups report a higher toll.
Despite warnings by human rights groups that Duterte may be overseeing a crime against humanity, the leader remains widely popular in thePhilippines.
He won a landslide victory in presidential elections last year after promising an unprecedented war on drugs in which tens of thousands of people would be killed.
Meanwhile in neighbouringIndonesia, Amnesty International said on Wednesday that police were taking a leaf out of Duterte's "war on drugs" and have killed 60 suspected drug dealers so far this year, compared to 18 in all of 2016.

Protecting the pachyderms
The Life of Last Proboscideans: Elephants launched:
On Sunday evening, The Life of Last Proboscideans: Elephants, was officially launched at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute. Written by Tharindu Muthukumarana, the book tells the story of elephantsof their past, their role in the world and what better modes of conservation would be.
The first treatise on elephantology (the study of elephants) was produced over 2,000 years ago, Muthukumara said, and I see my book as the result of an evolution of the field.
Speaking at the launch were the books author, environmentalist Rohan Wijesinha, former Wildlife Department Director General Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya, Managing Trustee of Biodiversity and Elephant Conservation Trust Jayantha Jayawardene and Wildlife and Sustainable Development Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, as well as the events chief guest. Each of the speakers stressed the problems facing the status quo for elephants, discussed the importance of elephants culturally and religiously, and commended Muthukumarana for his efforts to protect the vulnerable creatures.
Pilapitiya, the former Wildlife Department Director General, addressed some issues facing elephants in Sri Lanka specifically. He spoke of an administrative boundary set up in Yala which is harming the elephants livelihood because it paid no heed to their natural roaming patterns.
We must move the fence from an administrative boundary to an ecological boundary to solve the problem, he said.
Pilapitiya also touched on the elephant infant mortality rate in Yala. 52 percent of baby elephants below two years of age in Yala are dying, he said, This is happening because mothers dont have proper nutrition. He concluded his speech by saying that Sri Lankans must be proactive in ensuring the security of elephants within the country.
Jayawardene, who acted as a mentor of sorts to the books author, spoke next. He touched on the fact that Sri Lankans specifically should be concerned with the welfare and continuance of elephants, given the prominence they hold both religiously and historically to both Buddhism and Hinduism.
Then the author spoke, beginning by wishing everyone a belated happy and optimistic World Elephant Day, which was notably just one day before the event, on Saturday, August 12th.
He discussed embarking on this project while still a pre-teenager, and catalogued the journey he took in researching it, writing it, and finally bringing it to press. He engaged the audience and the room was animated with an applause at the end of his remarks, awed by a 23-year-old who had already done so much for the elephantine cause.
Wijesinha, an environmentalist who was moderating the event, subsequently introduced the book launchs chief guest: Gamini Jayawickrama Perera. In lauding Minister Perera, Wijesinha explained that being an advocate for elephants in Parliament was hardly an easy task, and yet it was one that Perera had assumed.
To take up the portfolio of wildlife in Parliament means you are directly going up against your colleagues, since they are advocating for development. Development is very important, but we must remember that we share this country with our creatures.
Before handing over the microphone to Perera, Wijesinha concluded by saying, We must remember that nature doesnt need humans, but humans need nature!
Last up to speak, before a reception and opportunity to purchase books was Minister Perera.
His speech stressed the efforts Parliament was making, and what more it could do, to help elephants. And he concluded on a joking yet poignant note, bringing full circle the effect author Tharindu Muthukumarana was having on the conservation of elephants.
I think Thamindu was once an elephant (in another life). And now, hes been born again to save the elephants.

Samurdhi list will be promptly revised: SB
Certain names deleted accidentally:
On the advice of President Sirisena and in accordance with the Cabinet Sub Committee directives, the Samurdhi recipients list would be revised promptly as certain names had been accidentally removed due to a technical error of the computer programme and several technical defects, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
Therefore a fresh list of Samurdhi recipients would be prepared, as the existing list had been cancelled with effect from yesterday (16).
The Minister made these remarks while addressing the media in Colombo yesterday.
The Cabinet Sub Committee was appointed by the President to look into the grievances of people, whose names had been erased from the Samudhi recipients list.
Meanwhile the President has advised the minister to look into the issue and re-enter the names of these persons who were affected due to the technical error.
While investigating into the issue, it has been revealed that names of around 200 persons had been erased from the Samurdhi recipients list due to a technical error, he added.
However, it had been necessary to revise the Samudhi recipients list as certain persons were receiving Samurdhi benefits, while certain people who were eligible to receive the Samurdhi were left behind, he added. Minister Dissanayake said the process of revising the name list would be completed within the next two months.
