Anura Ranasinghes 19th death anniversary :
Sri Lanka crickets Kohinoor Diamond
Way back in 1966, on a pleasant Sunday morning, two of us, my wife Swarna  a retired teacher attached to Stafford Ladies College and I were on our way to the Sunday fair (pola) at Kirulopone. At that time we were residing at Nugagahawatte Gardens, opposite the public park, Kirulopone.
It was about 9.15 am. A tennis ball cricket match was in progress. There was a fair crowd witnessing the match. A tiny tot, about 10-11 years, a right hand batsman was batting aggressively, facing a youth fast bowler. Without any fear he was dispatching the ball to all parts of the park. I was also a teacher attached to Nalanda College, Colombo and the master in  charge of cricket, and the prefect of games. I asked my wife to proceed to the pola alone. I joined the spectators at the park.
I inquired from a gentleman who was witnessing the match, who this little boy batting He said Sir, this boy is Mr and Mrs Ranasinghes son and showed me the house in the corner of the park.
As I thought this was good material for Nalanda College cricket, I went in search of Anura Ranasinghes house. A lady came out. I told her that her son is a fine cricketer and inquired from her where this boy was studying Sir, he is studying in your school Nalanda, stated Mrs Ranasinghe.
The following day, I went to the Primary section, spoke to the boy, Anura Ranasinghe and told him to turn up for my under 12 cricket practices.
This fearless tiny tot was an amazing naturally gifted cricketer. When Mr Gerry Gunaratne, Nalanda cricket coach (my cricket coach too) came for the first eleven practices I told him about this boy. Sir, there is a little boy, a fine batsman, I like you to observe him. I took him to a side, where Anura was batting. After about 10 minutes, the words late Mr Guneratne said still echoes in my mind.
My God Chap Epa! This bloke is a freak. This fellow will be like my good friend Sathasivam. For heavens sake Epa, dont try to teach him, he needs no coaching manual. He is a gutty, fearless, born cricketer, only discipline him. Guide him. I will tell you, in another eight or nine years, if this boy continues cricket, he will play for Ceylon, said ever green coach Gerry Gunaratne.
What a prediction! Words of wisdom, true to Mr Guneratnes predictions Anura Ranasinghe gained his Ceylon cap before he was 20 years.
Anura was born on October 13th, 1956. His parents were Mr and Mrs Ranasinghe. His elder brother Laxman presently working in Wijeya publications is a sports journalist, his other brother Aruna is a banker by profession. All of them played for Nalanda first eleven. Anura has an elder brother Bandula and two sisters, if my memory serves right. Anura hails from a responsible family from Kirulopone.
Anura not only captained the first eleven in 1975, he also broke the unique bowling record of late P.W. Perera (another cricket coach for more than three decades) at the big match against Ananda.
Anura skippered the under 19 Sri Lanka team, which included the batting artist of Ceylon Ranjan Madugalle and under his captaincy, Sri Lanka beat Pakistan under 19 led by Javed Miandad.
While at Nalanda he won his International Cap and played against West Indies and scored a swashbuckling innings of 27 runs, facing Andy Roberts, Keith Boyce, Vanburn Holder and Bernard Julian.
Anuras ODI debut was on 7 June 1975 against West Indies at Manchester. He excelled with the bat against Australia too.
His first Test was against Pakistan from March 14-19 1982. His last test was against India on 17-22 September 1982 at Chennai, Madras.
Nalanda Principal late Sugunadeva Atukorale helped Anura when he was at Nalanda. Further Prefect of Games and Master in-charge of cricket Mr Nelson Mendis, Mr Premasara Epasinghe and Mr Cecil Gamage, guided this brilliant all-rounder at Nalanda to Himalayan heights.
Anuras international cricket career came to an end in December 1982 with Bandula Warnapuras South African tour. This tour tarnished the cricket image of Sri Lanka. A fine cricket administrator and secretary of the Board of Control Neil Perera in one of his articles called Warnapuras South African tour as an indespicable tour of South Africa. By this tour many talented cricketers like Laith Kaluperuma, Hemantha Devapriya, Ajith de Silva, Susantha Karunaratne etc cut short their future cricket careers by touring apartheid South Africa. This was the biggest blow Sri Lanka cricket experienced. It tarnished the image of the country too.
Anura was a lovable student who always respected his teachers, coaches and elders. This great Sri Lankan all-rounder breathed his last on 9 November 1998 at the age of 42 years and 57 days.
In Sri Lanka, some grounds are named in honour of some outstanding sportsmen who brought credit to the country.
In Colombo, there is PD Sirisena grounds, named on behalf of the most outstanding soccerite produced in Sri Lanka.
Then down south  Matara, there is a ground named Sanath Jayasuriya grounds in honour of the man who turned limited over cricket upside down.
In Kandy, there is Pallekele, you find Muttiah Muralitharan grounds named after the world bowling record holder.
I appeal to the authorities of the Colombo Municipality, who does so much service to Colombo city dwellers, to name Kirulopone Park as Anura Ranasinghe Park or grounds, the ground that the internationally famous cricketer was born, bred and where he commenced his unique cricket career.

Sri Lanka Tourism signs MoU with Australia's  MDF On Unawatuna Beach Development
The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Australian Government-supported Market Development Facility (MDF), to collaborate on a comprehensive development programme for the Unawatuna beach.
Unawatuna, a key tourist destination in the Southern province, will be developed as a pilot project for a comprehensive, market-based livelihood development programme, with a special focus on employment generation and economic empowerment.
The proposed programme will serve to centralise the market players of Unawatuna, a colourful but scattered market landscape of vendors and hoteliers of varying scales, in a way that is beneficial to all. They will also be encouraged to operate around the clock to better utilize the market opportunities, which also includes a night market.
The proposed programme will transform the Unawatuna beach into a major attraction for tourists visiting across the Southern coastal belt as well as for the domestic tourists from Colombo as it gives them an opportunity to experience Sri Lankan street food and purchase crafts while engaging with the local economy.
It will also empower the community in the area and open up new economic and employment opportunities. This is the first step in a larger tourism strategy by the SLTDA to set up a network of micro destinations across the island, in line with the government's ambition of systematically and proactively engaging in planning destinations, as indicated in the new Tourism Strategic Plan 2017-2020.
An apex tourism body like the SLTDA has the ability to make potentially catalytic innovations in the market, which is why MDF, and the Australian Government, have a keen interest in collaborating with them. The SLTDA has great scope and access to a wide range of tourism businesses, and a night market would be an ideal way of exploring the potential of coastal destination beyond their traditional attractions, said Shahroz Jalil, Country Representative of the Australian Government-supported Market Development Facility (MDF), speaking at a signing ceremony held at the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), on Tuesday (07).
The MDF programme in Sri Lanka is affiliated with the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs and shares the Ministry's mandate to diversify tourism and related sectors in Sri Lanka.
MDF also works closely with the Sri Lankan private sector, focusing on business innovation to make tourism gains more inclusive by drawing in more young people and women into the industry and connecting poor households with high-value tourist markets. MDF already works with selected tourism players in Sri Lanka to this end.
Commenting on the agreement, SLTDA Chairman Kavan Ratnayake said, Tourism in Sri Lanka has so far been growing opportunistically, and this has proved successful.
But the next big step for us is to develop sustainable tourism destinations systematically, so that resources can be allocated where they can deliver the greatest benefit.
And it's important that we start key projects like this as triggers for future industry growth.

The tablets for 200,000 A-level students will start in January.The tender has been given.
Fernando conceded that the tender process if appealed, as tenders in the country usually are, might result in the delayed distribution of the tablets. Still, he insisted that even with a two-month delay, students should have tablets in hand by the end of the year.
Imagine that 200,000 students will be able to take a tablet home, students from Ampara, Jaffna, Polonnaruwa, Galle, Hambantota, Badulla. These devices will be in houses, seen by parents. Things are starting to change, Fernando said.

Tax to be increased on sugar in sweetened drinks
The Health Ministry proposed the Government to impose one rupee tax on each extra gram of sugar (after the sixth gram) contained in sweetened drinks, Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J. M. W. Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a health seminar held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday he said that sugar is being used for food and drinks in Sri Lanka due to various other reasons and not because people need sugar.
Taxation on sugar will save people from several diseases, especially Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs). According to Dr. Bandara, at the moment alcohol consumption and smoking is in a very high level in the country and daily three persons die from oral cancers.
Unfortunately, every month only around 20 women and few males visit Healthy Life Style Centres (HLCs) established covering the entire country which offer free screening for NCDs, medical examinations, blood tests, medications, consultation and many other facilities free of charge.
Earlier, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said that the approval of World Health Organization had been received to impose a tax of one rupee on every extra gram of sugar (over six grams) contained in sugary sweetened drinks.

THEY FEEL pain, fear, love, frustration
PETA, the largest animal rights organization in the world, with more than 6.5 million members and supporters operates under the simple principle that animals are not ours to eat, to wear, experiment on, or use for entertainment. PETA Asia Vice President of International Campaigns Jason Baker talks to the Daily News on PETAs latest achievements, campaigns and limitations.
Elaborate on PETA Asias vision and mission
PETA Asia is an affiliate of PETA US, the worlds largest animal rights organization. PETA US and its affiliates have more than 6.5 million members and supporters worldwide.
PETA Asia is dedicated to establishing and protecting the rights of all animals. We operate under the simple principle that animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on, or use for entertainment, and we focus our attention on the four areas in which the largest numbers of animals suffer the most intensely for the longest periods of time: on factory farms, in laboratories, in the clothing trade, and in the entertainment industry. We also work on a variety of other issues, including spaying and neutering of companion animals.
What are PETAs main focus areas
One of the main areas PETA focuses on is China. Were working hard to urge the next generation of Chinese residents to condemn the idea that animals are ours to use in any way.
Weve also created Chinese leafletson topics ranging from vegetarian eating and fur to spaying and neutering and zoosthat we supply to local groups and activists free of charge. We actively visit schools and universities across China, set up information tables at events around the country, and partner with companies to inform people about the need to make compassionate choices. Grassroots work is essential to the success of the animal rights movement, so we also work closely with local activists and groups throughout China.
What are the latest animal welfare projects initiated by PETA
As just one example, PETA has been touring with an animatronic bear, Bobo, to popular locations in Beijing in order to inform people of the way in which bears used for entertainment are typically taken from their families as cubs and hung by their necks to force them to learn to stand on two legs, before being shipped around the country to perform tricks such as Hula-Hooping and riding a bike.
Whats the latest situation of Mali, the elephant, who is being kept in a tiny enclosure at the Manila Zoo
Mali is still at the Manila Zoo. We are in constant communication with all relevant government authorities and are working with them to attempt to secure her freedom. We regularly check up on her and the other animals at the zoo. We work with the media, getting her into the news, both locally and internationally. We also work through online marketing, public education, media and celebrity campaigns, and other strategies to draw attention to her suffering, and we wont stop until she has the life that she deserves. Social change doesnt happen overnight, but we have faith that the relevant authorities will make the right decisionto free Maliif we continue putting pressure on them to do so.
As we know PETA has no legal authority to talk against international animal exchange. In which ways can PETA reach out to such innocent animals
Animal advocates dont have the legal authority to stop this cruelty or to take the animals away, because such activities arent illegal. Our best hope for helping these animals is to encourage caring people not to visit zoos or any other institution that exploits animals for profit.
As an organization that supports animal freedom, have you launched any campaigns to promote safari parks and ban zoos
PETA works through public education, eyewitness investigations, research, advocacy for animal-protection legislation, celebrity involvement, and protest. As long as people continue to buy tickets, animals will continue to suffer. Zoos will be forced to stop breeding and capturing more animals from the wild if their financial support disappears. We encourage people to family, friends, and coworkersespecially those with small childrenwho may be inclined to go, and explain to them that every ticket purchased directly contributes to animals misery.
International organizations such as UN are thoroughly concerned about human rights violations of its member countries. Would it be possible to establish a similar international organization to address animal rights issues Can PETA initiate that
Many of our victories across Asia have been achieved by working with local governmentsinstead of against themin order to cultivate positive relationships with them that will benefit our work for animals in the future. Unfortunately, getting the animal rights message to the public isnt always easy and straightforward. Unlike our oppositionwhich is mostly composed of wealthy industries and corporationsPETA must rely on getting free advertising through media coverage. We often do outrageous things to get the word out about animal abuse, because sadly, the media usually dont consider the facts alone sensational enough to cover. Using these tactics, were able to grab headlines, thereby bringing the animal rights message to audiences around the world.
PETAs positions may be controversial, but they are always true to its driving mission: to stop animal abuse worldwide. Is this what sets PETA apart from other such organisations
PETA has always been known for having uncompromising, unwavering views on animal rights. Our purpose is to stop animal suffering, and we use all available opportunities to reach millions of people with powerful messages. We arent afraid to make the difficult comparisons, say the unpopular thing, or point out the uncomfortable truth if it means that animals will benefit.
What is the most animal friendly country What are the worst countries for animals
Taiwan made headlines earlier this year after its decision to outlaw the consumption of cat and dog meat, a first in Asia. In addition, Taipei earned the top spot on PETAs list of the Top 10 Vegan-Friendly Cities in Asia. Taipeis vegan scene is the most dynamic in Asia, thanks to numerous restaurants that offer cutting-edge vegan meals and a powerful community of animal advocates.
In China, on the other hand, the abuses perpetrated against animals throughout the country are often incomprehensible. Animals languish in substandard zoos all over the country, entertainment parks where patrons can purchase live animals to feed to tigers continue their cruel operations, and dog and cat markets flourish all over the region. Working against awful situations such as these isnt usually possible from a legal standpoint because, for the most part, no penalties exist for cruelty to animals. For this reason, PETA focuses on China, and several employees frequently travel to cities such as Beijing, Jining, Nanjing, and Shanghai to meet with government officials in order to discuss ways of helping to improve the treatment of animals.
What are PETAs remarkable achievements Are you satisfied with your achievements up to now
Our work in China is changing hearts and minds. Last year, we blew the lid off Chinese circuses and caused a huge stir. An investigator saw bear cubs chained to the wall with rings through their snouts, lions and tigers being hit with heavy metal poles, and monkeys shackled by the neck, defecating in fear as they tried to escape from their handlers. One of the videos from the investigation was viewed more than 60 million times, and media outlets and state newspapers came down hard on the perpetrators. The investigation also prompted Chinas State Forestry Administration to conduct a raid on a circus and confiscate more than 20 bears when trainers failed to produce a license for them.
Those forward-thinking attitudes are also reverberating throughout the fur industry. China is the worlds largest fur exporter, but as abuse on fur farmswhere millions of foxes, minks, dogs, and other animals are strangled, electrocuted, and skinned each yearhas come to light, exports have dropped. Fur is losing popularity domestically, too. More Chinese celebrities, including A-list actorsSun Li, Yang Mi, and Chen Bolin, are speaking out against fur.
We know that change comes incrementally in any movement, but were making progress, especially among Chinese youth. The way that humans treat animals is changing in China and around the world.
Is PETA dedicated to promote vegetarianism
Not only does following a vegan lifestyle save the lives of countless animals, a UN report concluded that factory farming is one of the most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems at every levelfrom local and global.
Almost all of us grew up eating meat, wearing leather, and going to circuses and zoos, but we realize now that all animals have the capacity to feel pain, fear, love, frustration, and lonelinessand to suffer just as humans do. They deserve to lead lives free from suffering and exploitation. Every time that we make a choiceright down to what meal to eat or what shoes to buywe can choose to be cruel or to be kind, and something as seemingly small as choosing a veggie burger over a beef burger can make a world of difference for animals.

UN screens SL Peacekeeping troops for human rights violations - Stphane Dujarric
The UN screens Sri Lankan troops being selected for peacekeeping posts for human rights abuses and allegations, UN Spokesman Stphane Dujarric said at a press briefing on November 8. He was responding to an agency press report saying that more than 50 Tamil men have been tortured and sexually abused by Sri Lankan Police and Military since early 2016.
Many of the men are seeking political asylum in Europe, and bear scars and burns on their bodies, according to the report. They told the agency press, they were accused of being affiliated with or trying to revive the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
There is screening done in partnership with the (Department of Peacekeeping Operations) and the (Department of Field Support) on ensuring that none of the troops that are committed to UN peacekeeping have any human rights abuses, allegations or issues hanging over their head, Dujarric said.
Responding to the article, Foreign Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam said that the National Unity Government is committed, as promised to the people of the country, to work towards reconciliation, good governance, rule of law, and the promotion and protection of human rights.
Kariyawasam said that the government has taken numerous concrete steps to prevent the commission of torture. This year, disciplinary action has been taken against 33 police officers for assault and torture, and one officer has been dismissed, Kariyawasam said in a written statement. 100 cases are still pending, he added, and 28 cases of assault and torture have been received since January.
The Government seeks the assistance and cooperation of all those relevant parties in this endeavour, including parties outside the country, as evidence is key in the conduct of investigations, Kariyawasam said.

Underappreciated  feline  orbiter
Everyone knows the names of famous astronauts like Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and some may even remember Laika, the first dog in space. However, the first cat in space has been largely forgotten by history.
This pioneering pussycat was named Flicette, and she was shot into space 54 years ago this week from a base in the Sahara desert by the Centre National dtudes Spatiales (CNES), the French version of NASA.
Flicette was picked out of a group of about a dozen cats because she had the best reaction to a series of tests that included a spin in a centrifuge, according to EuroNews.
Her 12-minute flight took her 97 miles above Earth and included five minutes of weightlessness.
Although this Astrocat made history, Flicette was euthanized a few months later so scientists could study the effects of space travel on her body. No cat has been in space since and Flicette has become a UFO  an underappreciated feline orbiter.
Even worse, in some of the few tributes she received, shes been misidentified as a male named Felix, according to LeDauphine.com Now a British advertising executive is hoping to restore Flicette to the pantheon of great space explorers by erecting a statue in her honor in Paris, France.
Matthew Serge Guy, a creative director for Anomaly London, has started a Kickstarter campaign to raise $52,439 for the statue.
Around six months ago whilst at work, I came across a tea towel in the staff kitchen commemorating the 50th anniversary of the cat who went to space, Guy said in a release. There was no name for the cat on the towel, nor did it resemble Flicette.
After Googling it, I became fascinated with Flicettes story, how it had been forgotten over the years, and (like the design of the tea towel) misattributed. It felt like something big should be done to right these wrongs.
The campaign video seems to have catapulted Flicette back into the public eye. After one day, Guy is nearly 20 percent towards his goal with a month to go.
Guy emphasizes to recognize that Flicette and other animals involved in the early days of space exploration suffered and had no choice in the matter.
Its also important to note that Flicette, alongside many other animals that have braved space travel in the name of science, was ultimately an unwilling participant in this experiment, he wrote.
For this mission alone she, alongside 13 other cats, experienced arduous training prior to the mission and eventually gave her life. The Huffington Post

Unlocking Emotions
The dramatists of Musaeus College have learnt to appreciate the unique beauty of drama, its relevance and its timelessness. They have learnt to unlock what has been dormant within them, learning of life on stage. Dramatic Moves feature the dramatists of Musaeus College whose lives have been enriched through drama.
Teacher in Charge, Chithranie Abeyratne, a product of Southlands College Galle, has been a versatile dramatist herself acting the role of Shylock in Merchant of Venice and Mark Antony in Julius Caesar when she was a school girl.
These students gain a lot by doing drama and they really enjoy it. It brings out their talents. By acting on stage they build up their personality. I have been teaching drama for quite a long time in many other schools. I have taught at boys schools and when I look back I can see how far they have gone. They are now holding very responsible positions and they have a good understanding about others. The girls are the same and I can see how enthusiastic these students are. They love to come out of the classrooms and display their talents. They enjoy and share and work in unison. They learn how to get on in society. So we have certainly come a long way. I joined Musaeus College around four and a half years back and we formed a new drama circle, said Abeyratne.
At school level in the year 2016, we staged three dramas, The Caucasian Chalk Circle by Bertold Brecht, Hamlet by Shakespeare and Happy Wives (a script by the teacher in charge). I organized a competition amongst the students and they were awarded for their performances on criteria such as acting, stage management ect; receiving certificates and medals. So the talents of the children were appreciated, said Abeyratne.
Abeyratne added that life would be very dull if you are only confined to the classroom. She recalls the famous speech by Mark Antony  Friends, Romans, Countrymen, Lend me your ears, I come to bury Caesar not praise him.
He made the people understand what has happened. Brutus had misled the people. I would have been around 15 or 16 years when I played Mark Antonys character and Shylock. Mark Antony was a true friend of Caesar. He did not betray Caesar. He was really sorry about what happened to Caesar. He wanted to convince the people as to who Caesar was. When Caesar was offered the crown thrice, he refused it. Mark Antony made the people understand that Brutus had misled them. He was capable of convincing the people through his speech. Caesar was a great person who won a lot of wars. People become jealous when others show their capabilities.
That is what is really happening in todays society as well. When some show talent and capabilities, others become jealous. They somehow want to destroy that person. Brutus pretended to be a sincere friend of Caesar, and betrayed Caesar.
He stabbed Caesar to death. Children can learn so much from these plays. People can be so close to you, but can you trust them Children become mature when they learn from these characters. Brutus showed Caesar that he was so close to him, but what did he do He planned and killed Caesar. But Mark Antony was not like that. He was a true friend of Caesars, explained Abeyratne.
These girls get to know what real life is and when they analyze the characters they can identify the weaknesses or good qualities of the characters.
Easy going
President, Dulya de Silva feels that it was the role of Queen Titania in Midsummer Nights Dream that is her favourite because it involved her going really deep into the character. Titania is actually a very complex character.
I really liked playing around with what she does and what she becomes in the end. That was definitely my favourite. She is a very flirty and fun character and because of that I enjoyed enacting her role, said De Silva.
Another character that appealed to her was when she portrayed the character of a drunken beggar. It was an inter-house drama. It was of course a male role. The story of the man was the story of someone who had lived a really hard life.
He was one of those people who were struck down by circumstances. So I really enjoyed that character. It was a simple character. I was on stage for a couple of minutes but I was really emotionally connected. Because while doing that drama, we all got very into our characters and we really thought how these peoples lives were. Because of that we got very connected, said De Silva.
De Silva pointed out that when you do drama you sort of place yourself in the position of those characters.
You question, what would I do in this situation What would my character do After you play something a little bit of that character stays in you forever. We still talk about our dramas. A little bit of the characters we play stay with us. Drama has helped me become a leader and helped me work with people because you learn how to work with different people. You learn to be easy going and mix with all of these people, you learn to be on good terms with them. Drama has made me become a stronger person and I understand people better. I have become nicer, pointed out De Silva.
Modern life
Vice President, Januki Jayakody felt that it was the character of Quincein Midsummer Nights Dream that she enjoyed portraying.
He is a lot like me personality wise, because he is a pessimist I think and he has the type of aura where he gets everyone to do what he wants them to do. I can relate to him personally. That was really nice because that made me understand him more. And I was able to play him better so it was a lot of fun. It was a male role so it was different. But the whole experience was nice and it was fun, said Jayakody.
In Chalk Circle, Jayakody enacted the role of Blockhead. He does not talk, he just walks around and he limps, he is not a very strong character. At first she says it was hard.
When I was playing that character, I did not know how to exactly express everything I had to say without words. It was very interesting because when I was playing that character, I had a partner who would boss me around. I felt how he would have felt when someone starts screaming at you even though it is not really your fault and whatever you are doing does not seem to be good enough.
I really liked that character and when I got to play it I started to understand that all people are not the same and they convey things in different ways. I really liked that character even though it was a really short amount of screen time, said Jayakody.
Jayakody pointed out that what she has gained from drama is an ability to empathize because of the diverse roles she has played. Everyone sees life in a different way.
You try to relate the character to modern life. When you do that, you learn how society acts. You then find different qualities about yourself that were never brought into light. You learn that you are good at things that you did not really know. When you get into a character you do things you thought were never possible. You unlock these emotions within you. Drama is a lot about creativity and how you perceive things, so it has helped me think, interpret things and make my imagination work, pointed out Jayakody.
A mischievous character
Joint Secretary, Yalindee Premaratnefelt it was the character of Puck in Midsummer Nights Dream that she liked the most. Puck and I are close in this mysterious way. He is a mischievous character. I could relate to that character. Strangely I have always played male roles and I have never played female roles, except once.
More than female roles I have learnt to learn more about male roles-their different ways, and so it has changed me and I have got to know about many things. Through drama I have certainly learnt a lot about people, their different natures and different characters. I think I will never really enjoy playing female roles! said Premaratne.
Kind of difficult
Joint Secretary, Bendoorie Punchihewa said thatit was the character of Snout in Midsummer Nights Dream that appealed to her the most. Unlike my fellow thespians I was nothing like my character! I am a completely different person! At first it was kind of difficult, but under the guidance of my teachers I was able to adapt to my character and it was really nice because that is the beauty of acting. You can actually relate to another character, absorb the aspects of another person who is very different to you. I really liked that character, said Punchihewa.
Punchihewa recalled a play at an inter-house competition that was a very feminist play.
That was when I understood what feminism was properly. It was a play where there was a Queen and all the women in the country were helping her to face a war, and every man was standing up against them. I was the person who directed the queen take a good decision when she was mentally imbalanced.
That sort of changed my mentality about how I think of society. That character really inspired me. That was the most emotional character I played. When I played the character of Grusha in the Chalk Circle that also really changed my mindset a lot. I think I am a really good feminist because of those dramas, stated Punchihewa.
Punchihewa pointed out that it was indeed Madam Abeyratne who introduced them to the beauty of Shakespeares plays.
We did not know much about Shakespeare before. She made us act them out and feel those characters.
I think I have learnt something from these characters. It has added something to my life. Everything I have learnt from drama is important to my life. I am pretty sure I can use all these qualities I have got to make my life even better, said Punchihewa.

Ven. Sobitha, the Desmond Tutu of Sri Lanka
Wednesday marked the second death anniversary of the Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, a towering figure among the country's bikkhu fraternity, but for whose dedication, indomitable courage and pioneering spirit there would not be a Yahapalanaya regime today. The event was marked fittingly, with President Maithripala Sirisena in attendance, together, with all civil society organsiations and groups, which went to form the Movement for Social Justice, of which the Ven. Sobitha was the convenor, and the vanguard in the campaign to oust the corrupt Rajapaksa regime. In fact, it was Sobitha Thera who was the original choice for the Common Candidate, for which there was a strong campaign led by political parties and civil society groups. But the Thera, characteristically, declined the offer.
President Sirisena, no doubt, will be the first to acknowledge that the charisma, benign influence and wide popularity enjoyed by the Ven. Sobitha, was the key factor that swayed the voter in his favour. The Ven. Thera was the central figure in the campaign to enthrone the Common Candidate, who was able to convince the vast majority, of the dire need for a change in course for the country, caught in the throes of nepotism, corruption, impunity and misgovernance. He was the Desmond Tutu of Sri Lanka, who fearlessly took on the might of all governments, when they veered from the path of righteous governance. His battles with JRJ and Premadasa are only too well known to need elaboration. His taking up cudgels on behalf of the Rathupaswala residents, the demonstrators who agitated against the Rajapaksa government's attempts to fiddle with the EPF, students at the receiving end of police brutality etc. no doubt, are etched in the memory of many.
Yet, he was also not one of those bikkhus who are today seen on streets, waging running battles with the police, bringing disgrace and dishonour to the saffron robe. He had other channels through which he articulated his views. Ven. Sobitha was a popular guest on TV talk shows where he aired his full range of views without pulling any punches, not caring on whose corns he was treading. This outspokenness, needless to say, did not endear him to the political powers of the day. But he stayed the course, rather than take the easy way out, and, pander to the politicians, the way some of our bikkhus are wont to do. For him, what mattered was justice, fair play and clean governance.
Ven. Sobitha was not an ordinary Buddhist monk, who was content to dwell in his temple abode, preaching and offering counsel to the devotees. He was an individual with a mission, to cleanse the body politic of the ills that afflicted it. In this endeavour he transcended political colours and ideologies. He did not support any political party, did not mount the platform of any politician. He was a monk who always clashed with the government in power, rather than take the convenient path of aligning with the powers that be, even as some of our Mahanayakes have been doing. Suffice it to say that no threat or physical assault, to which he was subjected to, succeeded in breaking his resolve.
As already mentioned, it was Ven. Sobitha, and his Movement for Social Justice, that proved the catalytic force that effected the January 8 regime change, evicting a leader who was considered invincible. It is pertinent to note that Mahinda Rajapaksa was a close associate of the Ven. Sobitha, who could have easily availed himself of state patronage and largesse, had he decided to play ball, blinding himself to the shenanigans of the Rajapaksas. With the number of Buddhist monks holding posts in state bodies, under Rajapaksa, Ven. Sobitha could easily have had his pick. It is the measure of the man and his principles that he chose to ignore these blandishments, and, instead, continued his mission of fighting corruption and family rule.
True, it was no secret that Ven. Sobitha was hurt and disillusioned by some of the developments under the regime he himself helped install, and, was in fact, out of the limelight in the days preceding the illness that claimed his life. He was particularly unhappy over the extraordinary delay in bringing to justice those politicians against whom massive corruption charges had been leveled. He also voiced his concern at the induction of defeated candidates into parliament and showering them with ministerial portfolios. However, his coming out into the open and being critical of the Yahapalanaya government went to show that he firmly stood by his principles and convictions and was not averse to even pinpointing the wrongs of the government that was formed with his blessings.
Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, no doubt, will be sorely missed, by not only those whose causes he espoused, but also the politicians who capitalized on the fund of goodwill, he had cultivated among the masses, to bring them into prominence. He will be remembered for many things, most importantly, as the Game Changer in the political battle, waged on January 8, that brought down a corrupt, oppressive regime.

77th death anniversary of Helena Wijewardene of Sedawatte Walawwa:
WIJEWARDENAS IN THE ANNALS OF HISTORY
Wewage Don Helena Dep Weerasinghe was born in 1864 at Waragoda, Kelaniya, married to Muhandiram Don Philip Tudugala Wijewardene of Tudugala Kalutara on September 1, 1880, at the Christ Church Cathedral, Mutwal. Don Philip was a well known timber merchant. This marriage saw the dawn of a new era of the Wijewardene family which began from Sedawatte.
Don Philip and Helena had nine children, seven boys and two girls. They are Don Philip Alexander, Agnes Helen, Don Louis, Don Richard, Don Edmund, Lizzie Harriet, Don Charles, Don Walter and Don Albert.
Helena's son Don Richard popularly known as DR was the founder of the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd (ANCL). He named his newspaper office in Fort after his mother's name Wewage, presently known as Lake House.
After the Government took over the Newspapers, DR's son Ranjith Wijewardene founded Wijeya Newspapers which now publishes The Sunday Times, Lankadeepa and Daily Mirror. D R Wijewardene's grandson Ranil Wickremesinghe is the present Prime Minister and Ruwan Wijewardene is the Defence State Minister.
Helena's eldest daughter Agne Helen's son Junius Richard (JR) Jayewardene became the first Executive President of Sri Lanka in 1978.
Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya restoration work
After her marriage to Don Philip, Helena with the family visited Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya on a Full Moon day in 1880 for worship. This visit turned a new chapter in the history of the temple. On this day when she walked into the Vihara to offer flowers at the Buddha statue, her feet sank in the mud on the then unpaved floor. This incident made her sad about the dilapidated state of the temple. Then and there, she made up her mind to restore the temple and made it worthy of a place for worship.
As the first step of the restoration work, she got the floor of the Vihara paved with uniform rock slabs. One slab was inscribed with her initials and the year as H.D.W 1888. This slab was laid near the main entrance to mark this event. Later in 1902, she replaced the wooden flower-altar that was in the Viharaya with a better one made of marble.
The restoration work of the temple thus began and continued over many years. In 1927 she laid the foundation stone for the complete restoration of the old Vihara. For this purpose, she got down artisans and sculptors from India and employed architects and artists from Sri Lanka. Her son Don Walter Wijewardene was a tower of strength to her and supported and encouraged her in all her renovation activities of the temple. A new wing to the old shrine room was added along with a central octagonal roof in the Kandyan style. Murals with a new style of delineation and colour were drawn on the walls of the new chambers. The pillars and the ceilings were executed in the traditional style of ancient sculpture. The doors and doorways were engraved with the Kandyan style of ornamental carvings.
Having continued the enormous restoration work of the temple over a lengthy period of time, the far-seeing lady turned her attention to the question of the future maintenance of the temple. A paddy field and a coconut land, measuring 250 acres in extent, were donated and with its annual income a fund called The Kelaniya Kalawewa Trust Fund was created. In addition to this, another land, called Uyanwatte, situated at Kelanimulla on the other side of the river was also gifted, to be maintained as a flower garden to supply the daily requirement of flowers for the poojas at the temple. All lovers of Sinhala art and sculpture, therefore, owe a great debt of honour and gratitude to this gracious lady, Helena Wijewardene of Sedawatte. Today, on account of her magnanimous work the restored Kelani Vihara, the pride of the nation's heritage, stands as a living monument to her pious zeal and generous munificence.
After the demise of her husband Don Philip in 1903, Helena Wijewardene moved out of Sedawatte and purchased Rickmand House on Stuart Place, now known as 44 Galle Road, Colombo 3, where they built their private residence, after demolishing Rickmand House. The new building was designed by architect Herbert Henry Reid, who later drew up plans for the restoration of the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara.
Kelaniya Temple Duruthu Perahera
The Wijewardene family - who were the patrons of the Vihara  named their new villa Sri Ramya. Helena Wijewardene, who was the maternal grandmother of former President J R Jayewardene, often visited this house during his childhood.
Sri Ramya was perhaps Sri Lanka's first private residence, embedded to the sea beach. Few are aware that it was at Sri Ramya the first trial performance of the Kelaniya Temple Duruthu Perahera commenced. The Wijewardene children recall that this early version of the perahera began with them carrying the sacred relic in a small procession out from one gate and back from the other. Today Helena's great grandson Dhammika Attygalle is the Chief Basnayake Nilame and the President of the Dayaka Sabha is Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe of the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara.
As the temple's patrons the family was entrusted with keeping the holy relic while the Vihara was being restored. A small rear room (above the drive) of Sri Ramya was fitted for the purpose with murals by the renowned artist Solis Mendis, who also painted the well-known Kelaniya Temple murals. One mural he did there in 1930 shows Helena Wijewardene with her sons standing in front of Sri Ramya.
The first wedding at this villa took place on January 9, 1931, between Helena Wijewardene's son Don Walter Wijewardene and Anula Kalyani Wijesinghe of Kamburupitiya.
They were the parents of business magnate Upali Wijewardene who was born in this same building. At Sri Ramya, Helena saw the birth of four grandchildren Rukmani Beligammana daughter of Don Charles and three children of Don Walter: Anoja Wijesundera, Kalyani Attygalle and Upali Wijewardene.
Helena's eldest son, Don Alexander, was the first Ceylonese to purchase and operate a modern Cargo Vessel, the SS Pengely travelling to Europe, Asia and the USA. Helena's grandson Philip Upali  PUW was the first Sri Lankan to own a Private Lear Jet Plane and a Bell Ranger Helicopter.
In May 1934 well-known Indian Poet Rabindranath Tagore and Painter Nanda Lal Bose spent a fortnight at Sri Ramya during a visit to Sri Lanka. In 1940 Sir Ivor Jennings called at the villa to meet noted ophthalmologist Dr A F Seneviratne, son-in-law of the elder Wijewardene's. On November 10 of the same year, Helena Wijewardene passed away at Sri Ramya at the height of World War II.
Helena's ashes are kept at mausoleum at Madampitiya cemetery.
In 1951, the US Government purchased the Sri Ramya for its Embassy and since 1993 it is the American Centre housing the library.
The ancestral Sedawatte Walawwa situated at Wellampitiya Road, Kolonnawa now belongs to Helenas great grandson Shalitha Wijesundera.

ZOYSA: the first hat-trick man in Tests for Sri Lanka
The first Sri Lankan bowler who will go down in history as having performed the hat trick in Test cricket is the tall and lanky left arm pace man DEMUNI NUWAN THARANGA ZOYSA who deserves to join the glittering array of SPORTS LEGENDS of Sri Lanka.
Before going on to dwell on ZOYSAs achievements as his career unwound, I would like to take readers to that memorable moment and day to the Harare Sports Club Ground in Zimbabwe. It was here that ZOYSA performed the feat which would remain etched in memory, especially in this writer's memory as the only Sri Lankan journalist covering the tour for the Daily News and the Sunday Observer.
It was a wonderful summers day in Harare, when after Chaminda Vaas sent down the first over that skipper Sanath Jayasuriya handed the new ball to ZOYSA. The gangling ZOYSA standing 6 feet 5 inches tall made his run up and with his first ball delivered an in swinger that had Trevor Gripper plumb in front.
Snicked to wicket keeper
Then next ball he bowled the out swinger and Murray Godwin who failed to read it and snicked to wicket keeper Romesh Kaluwitharana who gobbled the catch. Expectations were in the air and would ZOYSA bag the first hat trick and go down in the annals. Jayasuriya crowded the new batsman with a close in field.
A nervous Neil Johnson took guard. ZOYSA ran in and delivered a straight ball and Johnson was caught plumb in front and ZOYSA had created history. His team mates hugged and kissed him with some having to leap to hug him, because they could not reach him.
This is how the three batsman went  Trevor Gripper LBW ZOYSA 0, Murray Goodwin c Kaluwitharana b ZOYSA 0, Neil Johnson LBW ZOYSA 0. The writer too stood up to jubilate and acknowledge ZOYSAS epch making feat in the 1999/2000 tour of Zimbabwe.
Wreathed in smiles
His face was wreathed in smiles and his goose hairs would certainly have stood up as he leaped and pinched the air in inexpressible joy. I can imagine the joy because I was also one who captured two hat tricks and I know the over the moon feeling that ZOYSA would have enjoyed. I was glad I was there to be a part of that record breaking event.
But with ZOYSA and his mates savouring the success it was tinged with sadness when it was known that this rare feat was not recorded on film because at that moment something went wrong with the telecast and the great feat is not on record. Poor show on the TV people. Former Sri Lankan wicket keeper and opening batsman Ranjit Fernando was one of the TV Commentators.
The teams that played in that historic Test which was won by Sri Lanka reads  SRI LANKA  Marvan Atapattu, Sanath Jayasuriya (C), Russel Arnold, Mahela Jayawardene, T.M.Dilshan, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Chaminda Vaas, Indika de Saram, Pramodya Wickramasinghe and Muttiah Muralitharan.
Zimbabwe team
ZIMBABWE  Andy Flower (C), Grant Flower, Trevor Gripper, Murray Godwin, Neil Johnson, Grant Flower, Alastair Campbell, C. Whittal, G.Brent, C. Strang, Henry Olanga and E. Matambanadzo. ZOYSAS figures read  15- 4-22  3. Gaining admission to Isipathana College from Dharmaloka College, ZOYSA was spotted like a meteorite who was destined to shine in the cricketing firmament by coach of that time at Isipathana College U.S.C. Perera an off spinner of high class.
Although being a spin bowler U.S.C as he was popularly called, had the knack of spotting natural and emerging talent and encouraging and polishing whatever faults and taking it to the top level  Sri Lanka representation.
Great distinction
And in ZOYSA he coached a bowler who was going to deliver for the game and country with great distinction and rewrite the record books as being the first bowler to pocket a hat trick in Test cricket for the country.
At school cricket level for Isipathana, the gangling left armer was too much for opposing batsmen and used to instill fear and have opposing batsmen jelly-kneed at the wicket facing him. It is said that batsmen would want to quickly get to the non strikers end than face his life threatening deliveries. After and during his training at school a cricket enthusiast and loyal supporter of the school who took him to big time cricket was LIONEL NAWARAGODAGEDERA, who was later to join Percy Abeysekera and Saddhatissa as Sri Lankas cheer leaders and who did wonders to raise the spirit of the cricketers with their inspirational cheering in the country and abroad.
Cricket enthusiast
ZOYSA was first spotted by NAWARAGODAGEDERA while playing for Isipathana. NAWARA GODAGEDERA a knowledgeable cricket enthusiast and a dear friend of former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga requested Ranatunga to come and have a look at this tall and lanky pace man who was making waves.
Another enthusiastic Isipathanian who helped ZOYSA was HassanSinhawansa.
Ranatunga was impressed by the youngster he saw and invited ZOYSA to join the famous Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) from where the pace man coming under the leadership of Ranatunga began his phenomenal rise which ended him quickly sporting the treasured and memorable Sri Lanka Cap.
ZOYSA debuted for Sri Lanka in 1996/97 and in his first season with the SSC had career best figures of seven for 58 in a premier game. Test debut was not long in coming and it came against New Zealand in Dunedin in 1997. He played for the country for seven years. He was no mean batsman, but it was with the ball that he excelled.
Among the wickets
With ZOYSA being among the wickets in both Test and One-Day cricket, it is said that he had not the fortune, but probably the misfortune of being coached by former Australian left arm pace man Bruce Reid who for no unaccountable reason changed his natural action and unable to settle into his new action his speed and form dropped and with him suffering stress fractures his end was not long in coming.
ZOYSAS STATS  TESTS 30  RUNS 288  HIGHEST 28 n.o. BOWLING TEST - 30  WKTS - 64  BEST BOWLING 5 for 20. ODIS  95  RUNS 343 - HIGHEST 47 n.o. BOWLING  MATCHES 95  RUNS  3213  WKTS  108  BEST 5 for 26.

Last ODI vs India at Kolkata, Feb. 8, 2007. ZOYSA is undoubtedly a Sri Lankan cricket legend and earns mention in SPORTS LEGENDS. He is now on the bowling staff of Sri Lanka Cricket.

BUDGET 2018 TO ENERGISE ECONOMY
Targets US$ 5,000 Per Capita Income:Economic growth rate to 6% by 2020:Budget deficit to reduce upto 3.5% of GDP by 2020:Doubling exports to US$ 20 billion:FDI inflows of US$ 5 billion:
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera presenting his maiden budget for 2018 envisions to increase the economic growth rate to 6 percent by 2020 from the current 4.5 percent.
Economic analysts viewed this budget as one that would introduce far reaching reforms since 1978, to make the economy more competitive.
The fourth budget proposals of the Unity Government under the theme Blue Green Budget for the fiscal year 2018 will support the achievement of envisaged medium-term targets such as Per Capita Income of USD 5,000, one million new jobs, FDI inflows of USD 5 billion, and doubling exports to USD 20 billion.
In 2018, we envisage a GDP growth of 5 percent, inflation of around 6 percent, and we hope to achieve for the first time in almost 6 decades, primary surplus of 1 percent of GDP and a Budget deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP.
Minister Samaraweera stated that the overall, the economy is expected to grow by around 4.5 percent in 2017 and projected to move gradually to a higher GDP growth path of around 6 percent by 2020, while containing the level of unemployment at around 4 percent level.
He further said, We are in the process of effecting revenue reforms in all areas including Inland Revenue, Customs, Excise and others to raise Government revenue closer to 20 percent of GDP over the medium-term. As revenue increases, and expenditure remains well targeted and rationalized, overall budget deficit is expected to reduce up to 3.5 percent of GDP by 2020.
Minister Samaraweera stated that the government will introduce the Enterprise Sri Lanka Credit Scheme with the objective of encouraging the SME sector to strengthen Entrepreneurs. He added that during 2018-2020, the government will support the formation of 50 agro and fishery companies, 25 majority women owned companies, and 150 youth centric startups. These companies will have at least 10 equity shareholders and each shareholder will have invested at least Rs. 10,000.
He said that in order to encourage women entrepreneurs, the Enterprise Sri Lanka Credit Scheme will make available credit facilities with the interest subsidy being at least 10 percent more for women entrepreneurs relative to others.
The Finance Minister said that through the Budget 2018, Rs. 2,000 million has been allocated to further strengthen the skills development programmes undertaken by the National Youth Corps.We propose to implement a programme where youth groups will undergo 3 to 6 month training courses in a specific skill as demanded by the private sector. We will establish the Employment Preparation Fund at the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs with an allocation of Rs. 2,500 million.
With the aim of promoting direct foreign investments and simplifying business registration, a One Stop Shop for business registration through a single identification system and introducing of a system to scan and digitize company records, create a database of trademarks, using Department of the Registrar of Companies funds was also proposed.
Focusing on debt repayment, Samaraweera said the next three years would be crucial with debt repayments amounting to almost Rs.7,000 billion.
This includes the repayment of international sovereign bonds which will mature every year amounting to almost Rs. 600 billion where bunching is a severe strain on the Government finances. In 2018 alone, the debt repayment amounts to Rs. 1970 billion. As was the case in the last two years, the government did not compromise on the investments to be made in 2018, in spite of the impending debt burden.
With regard to Customs, Excise and Inland Revenue Depts will be restructured and strengthened by way of introducing new ordinances for better revenue collection.
With the aim of fostering reconciliation, a large number of proposals have been made including the construction of 50,000 brick and mortar houses for the North and East and introducing irrigation systems and construction of a home for differently abled women in the North, introduction of low interest loans and provision of a stable livelihood for 12,600 rehabilitated ex-combatants. Further an economic centre will be established in Jaffna, Dambulla and Colombo creating an economic triangle.
In addition, Rs. 2500 million will be allocated to provide housing and infrastructure for the Muslims who were forcibly evicted from the North by the LTTE in the early 1990s.
Minister Samaraweera in conclusion said the country is at the crossroads of history and the choice whether we are to walk forward, united in our diversity to a new age of freedom and prosperity or go back to the darkness of a bygone era is a choice which is ours to make.

Budget Implementation Unit opened at Finance Ministry

A Budget Implementation Unit has been set within the Finance Ministry to implement all budget proposals within the course of next year, said Finance Minister, Mangala Samaraweera today, while he acknowledged that implementation was one of the biggest challenges faced by his Ministry.
The Unit will be headed by Senior Advisor to the Finance and Mass Media Ministry, Mano Tittawella and Economic Advisor at the Ministry, Deshal de Mel.
They will produce monthly progress reports to the public, the Minister said. 
Budgets are always impressive and nice when presented but the challenge is in implementation, said Minister Samaraweera addressing the post Budget Forum organized by Ernst and Young at the Hilton. 
Speaking on his maiden budget, the Minister said his Budget in essence was that of Free enterprise, liberalization and globalization.
The whole thrust of the budget is the Enterprise Sri Lanka concept, he added as he explained, If Sri Lanka is to take off we have to awaken and re-energize the dormant entrepreneur in most Sri Lankans.
The Minister touching on the past stressed that Sri Lankans historically were merchants and traders and that the country always excelled when we have dealt with the outside world. This has motivated the current premise of opening up the markets further through FTAs and the removal of up to 1800 para tariffs next year.
Unfortunately the socialist mindset introduced is still with us so I thought it is time that Sri Lanka came forward and compete with the world. It should stop being a nanny state but we are there as a government to give everyone a helping hand. The budget is about helping the entrepreneurial spirit of our people, he said.

Catalan Parliament Speaker in court over independence bid
SPAIN: The speaker of Catalonia's sacked parliament appeared before Spain's Supreme Court on Thursday in the latest legal case brought against separatist leaders for their role in the region's divisive independence bid.
A judge may decide to detain Carme Forcadell and five former Catalan lawmakers on charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds after Catalonia's parliament voted last month to split from Spain.
They are suspected of having followed a concerted strategy to declare independence, before the official declaration on October 27, deepening Spain's most serious political crisis in decades.
That declaration was annulled Wednesday by Spain's Constitutional Court.
The Catalan crisis has prompted hundreds of businesses to re-register outside the wealthy northeastern region and caused disquiet in a European Union still dealing with Britain's shock decision to leave the bloc. On Wednesday, a general strike called in Catalonia by a pro-independence union triggered widespread travel chaos, cutting Spain's main highway link to France and the rest of Europe and disrupting trains from Barcelona to Paris, Marseille and Lyon.
Authorities said around 150,000 people were affected.
Encouraged by their charismatic figurehead Carles Puigdemont, Catalan leaders voted to declare unilateral independence from Spain after going ahead with a banned referendum on October 1.
Separatists said 90 percent of voters opted for independence, but critics counter that pro-unity supporters had boycotted a plebiscite that violated Spain's constitution.
In response, the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy suspended Catalan autonomy dismissing its parliament and government, and organised new regional elections for December 21.
A judge in Madrid last week ordered that eight members of Puigdemont's sacked government be detained for their role in the secession drive.
The Supreme Court could also decide to place Forcadell and the former lawmakers in pre-trial detention.
Forcadell's spokesman told reporters that as Catalan parliamentary speaker she didn't have the freedom to stop a vote in the chamber on independence.
Outside the court on Thursday a small group of protesters gathered, holding banners against independence.
There were also a handful of separatist supporters, facing opposition cries of Jail for Puigdemont! Puigdemont and four former Catalan ministers are in self-imposed exile in Belgium and are due to appear before a judge next week after Madrid issued a EU-wide warrant for their extradition.
The 54-year-old deposed leader has ignored a summons to appear before a judge in Madrid, saying he wants guarantees he will receive a fair trial. His presence in the European capital has raised some fears of stoking communal tensions in Belgium after Flemish separatists in the ruling coalition there spoke out in support of Catalan independence.
European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, who was in Spain on Thursday, said that the bloc was against any form of separatism that weakens Europe.
Despite the crisis, the EU on Thursday upgraded its growth forecast for Spain to a robust 3.1 percent for this year, leading the eurozone's major economies.
The charges faced by former Catalan leaders carry up to 30 years in jail.
Puigdemont in a letter to the Catalan daily El Punt Avui on Thursday called for the liberation of political prisoners held by the Spanish state. Amnesty International however said on Twitter that the jailed ministers could not be considered political prisoners... as they are accused of acts that may constitute a criminal offence.- AFP

CH-Army game   expect a thriller
The confrontation between two top rugby clubs CH and FC and Army SC in the Dialog A division inter-club league rugby first round match for the 2017/18 season at Racecourse grounds, Reid Avenue today should turn out to be a thriller. The match will kick off at 3.45 pm.
CH and FC who has been really down and out some seasons ago came back to their normal pattern of play in their last match against Kandy under the coaching of dedicated and hard working former national coach Thavita Thulagaese Laga.
The CH side has been training hard under their new captain Rohitha Chichi Rajapaksa last few weeks and are determined to pull off a morale-boosting win.
Army on the other hand started training two to three months back under the watchful eyes of their coach Nilfer Ibrahim who was also the national sevens head coach some time back.
Army will have to be at their very best if they are to beat the rejuvenated CH team in their home grounds at Racecourse.
Going by the two teams starting line-ups a close tussle for supremacy can be expected.
The forte of CH & FC has been their power-packed forwards. The CH eight especially their ever green flankers Yoshitha Rajapaksa and Sasanka Ariyaratne, along with Sathya Ranatunga, Terence Henry and Sajith Saranga have always given a terrific display in the loose but today they will be given a torrid time by the Army forwards spearheaded by burly Asoka Jayalal, Abeynayake, last years skipper Manoj Silva, Chameera Silva ably supported by Rosa.
In the set scrums CH hooker Kavinda Amarakoon should get the better of his vis-a-vis Sameera Wickramanayaka while the line outs should be shared between the CH duo of Saranga and Matheesha Sarathchandra and Armys Maduranga and Rosa.
With the halves combination of Avishka Lee and Shamry Burah having clicked very well in the last match the CH side will hope that Avishka will set his three quarters in motion at every turn as they have two hard running centres in Lee Keegal and Chula Susantha.
In addition they have two experienced wingers in Anuradha Herath and Heshan Maduranga who have stood out with their powerful runs down the flank with full back Samuel Maduwantha often joining the line to form the overlap.

China's inflation on solid growth as economy stabilizes
China reported mild consumer inflation growth in October while producer prices posted a strong increase, beating market forecasts.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.9 percent year-on-year in October, up from September's 1.6 percent, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement.
This was the biggest increase in nine months, but was still considered moderate compared to the government goal of around 3 percent for the whole year.
The number perfectly met market expectations, and was mainly a result of rising non-food prices, China Merchants Securities said in a research note. Non-food prices climbed 2.4 percent year-on-year, with health care prices jumping 7.2 percent from a year earlier. Home rental, education, culture and entertainment also saw rises of more than 2 percent. Food prices, which account for a significant part of the CPI calculation, dropped 0.4 percent from a year earlier, dragging down the CPI number by 0.08 percentage points, according to NBS statistician Sheng Guoqing.

Redefine punishment
A news item in the dailies, reported, a principal of a school at Urubokka had been remanded for assaulting a boy in his school who had been asked to cut his long hair and had not done so. Before I venture to speak of my school days experiences, I believe the word Assault is too severe and gives a more criminal picture rather than a school Punishment. My understanding of Assault is to take revenge and Punishment in this instance is for Correction and disciplining.
Recounting enjoyable school days, which we all cherish in our old age, I remember as a kid in the nursery class, when I slipped and fell into a muddy pool, my nursery class teacher Vansanden, chubby, plump lady carried me, laughing all the way, washed me, and dressed me in another baggy oversize trouser and shirt making the other kids laugh. She washed my trouser and shirt, dried them and ready to wear again before going home. In the higher grades we were punished for various mischief and the worst was the Best of the Six. I or my brothers did not complain to our parents what happens in school as they always took the side of the teachers and the treatment we got by telling my father, was worse. I remember, when I was to sit my Senior School Certificate (SSC) examination a friend of my father had told him to give me a wrist watch to be taken to the examination hall so that I could time the answering questions. When this was conveyed to the principal, whom he meets very often to inquire about our progress, had said the child will be more concerned about the new addition and not the question paper. I was also to wear a pair of long trousers for the first time and this too was not recommended for the same reason. So, I went to the examination hall in my  shorts and shirt without a wrist watch.
Another incident, my sister who studied in a Catholic convent once came home with a six inch brown paper hem pinned on to her skirt. When questioned she told my mother that sister nun had said the skirt was short and it should be below the knee. My mother went the next day to the convent and apologised to the nun saying it was an old dress. All these were done for girls to be decent, maintain their charm and dignity
Speaking of hair cut the Police Cut was accepted as the normal hair style. Incidentally, if school Uniforms are compulsory, then an acceptable hair cut should be made mandatory at least up to O/L. All these strictures were introduced with good intentions for the benefit of children in their later life. Those were the days when we respected our Principals and Teachers and feared them too, for they themselves were well disciplined and set examples to the students. Can we say that of today
I wonder whether we should emulate the west in framing certain rules and regulations as I believe, our conduct and behaviour are based on our culture and religion. A child not disciplined at the early stages by parents and teachers would end up being a nuisance to society. What we are today, thanks to our parents and teachers, whom we remember, with gratitude, though some of them are not in the land of living.

Debt free nation
PREAMBLE
1. Honourable Speaker, the year 2018 is a landmark year in the Sri Lankas post-independence history as we mark the 70th independence anniversary. On the eve of this historic moment, I am deeply honoured to present the National Budget 2018, being my maiden budget as the Minister of Finance and Mass Media, for the fourth year of the National Government, spearheaded by the President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe.
2. Mr Speaker, our small island nation gained independence on the 4th of February 1948 after ending a long spell of colonial rule. At that historic moment, people of the country and the rest of the world had great expectations and confidence on the future of this great nation. The late Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew once noted that Sri Lanka was the model colony of the British Commonwealth at the time of independence. The English newspapers at the time of independence projected the then Ceylon to be the Switzerland of the East due to its strength in human capital and natural resources. In 1948, the per capita GDP of the country was second only to Japan in Asia, whereas the others lagged behind.
3. However, since the day of independence, instead of collectively working towards building the nation, we were fighting with each other on the basis of political ideologies, ethnicity, religion, and even on the basis of cast. Hence, during the last 70 years, we encountered two violent insurgencies fueled by youth unrest and a three-decade long ruthless war. Nonetheless, the end of the war in May 2009, brought about a valuable opportunity to portray Sri Lanka as a country which respects and hounors diversity by winning the hearts and the minds of Tamil people and learning lessons from the past. Instead, the then rulers took advantage of this historic moment only to consolidate crony capitalist kleptocracy.
4. On the 8th of January 2015, President Sirisena took oaths against all odds at the time, when terror and corruption was the norm, embezzlement the economic vision, the country sliding towards complete isolation, internationally and the size of countrys debt stock even bigger than the Meethotamulla garbage dump".
PREVIOUS BUDGETS OF OUR GOVERNMENT
5. Mr Speaker, the new Government had to face the challenge of counteracting immediate and short term vulnerabilities the economy was exposed to prior to 2015. We laid a firm foundation based on the pillars of democracy and reconciliation and, on this, we also started building an innovation driven social market economy, accelerating economic growth in a fair and equitable manner. Mr Speaker, I would like to commend my predecessor Hon. Ravi Karunanayake for facing the challenges boldly and squarely and, placing the public finance management of the country on the right track.
ENORMOUS ECONOMIC CHALLENGE IN 2015
6. Mr Speaker, one of the major challenges we had to face was the rapidly and continuously falling Government revenue and a mountain of debt. The changing weather patterns including the prolonged droughts, frequent floods and landslides were also challenges we had to face during this period. The impact of such adverse weather is estimated to have cost us around 1% of GDP in 2017. Meanwhile, demand side pressures were also built up causing severe balance of payments difficulties.
DECISIVE TURNAROUND IN PUBLIC FINANCE
7. Mr Speaker, despite all these challenges, we are witnessing some early harvests of our prudent economic management policies. As a new Government, we have been able to make a decisive turnaround in the public finance management within a relatively short-period. We introduced reforms to domestic revenue mobilization and engaged productively with international development partners to regain lost confidence in Sri Lanka. Such measures helped reverse the decades-long downward spiral of Government revenue which increased up to 14.2% of GDP in 2016 from 11.5% of GDP in 2014, marking a growth of 41% in absolute terms. In 2017, Government revenue, I am certain, will come closer to 15% of GDP, ensuring a revenue growth of 13% in 2017 over 2016. Further, we are in the process of effecting revenue reforms in all areas including Inland Revenue, Customs, Excise and others in a manner to raise the Government revenue closer to 20% of GDP over the medium-term. As revenue increases, and expenditure remains well targeted and rationalized, overall budget deficit is expected to reduce up to 3.5% of GDP by 2020.
8. Mr Speaker, overall, the economy is expected to grow by around 4.5% in 2017 and projected to move gradually to a higher GDP growth path of around 6.0% by 2020, while containing the level of unemployment at around 4% level. We have already taken measures to strengthen the official reserves. Meanwhile, relatively high inflation observed in the recent months is expected to decelerate as the effects of supply side shocks wane. Thus, we expect real interest rates and real exchange rates to adjust towards equilibrium levels over the medium-term.
PRO-GROWTH REFORMS
9. Mr Speaker, our battle to restore macroeconomic stability on a more sustainable footing needs continuous effort. In line with Vision 2025, we need to undertake bold reforms in factor markets in order to eliminate price distortions and restore property rights in accordance with market principles aiming at promoting faster and sustainable growth.
Capital market reforms to capture its full potential are imperative for ensuring high growth over the medium-term and beyond. Without proper ownership of land and property, no country could achieve faster growth ensuring prosperity for all. In this context the countrys land and property ownership issues need a careful and urgent appraisal. Countrys labour demand against the constraints on labour supply requires a closer examination of all areas of the labour market including labour laws, to pave the way forward to harness the productive resources of the economy.
10. Mr Speaker, Sri Lanka needs an unrestricted economic growth to achieve the upper-middle income level by 2025. Sri Lanka needs to liberalize and globalize. The dormant spirit of competitiveness must be reawakened to make Sri Lanka the trading and the commercial hub it deserves to be. The country needs to shift away from being more protectionist and inward-oriented. Sri Lankas border measures need to see a complete revamp through well-targeted and time-bound trade reforms promoting growth. Our over dependence on non-tradable drivers challenges growth in the coming decade.
11. Mr Speaker, as the President assured at the 70th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, Sri Lanka is firmly committed towards the Post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As such, the Budget I present today is based on the principles of SDGs.
BLUE - GREEN BUDGET: ENTERPRISE SRI LANKA
12. Mr Speaker, I now present the Budget 2018 under the theme of Blue - Green Budget; the Launch of Enterprise Sri Lanka. It is Blue because we plan to integrate the full economic potential of ocean related activities in formulating the overall growth strategy. It is Green because we build our economy on an environmentally sustainable development strategy. The Enterprise Sri Lanka will reawaken the entrepreneurial spirit coming from our ancient forefathers enabling Sri Lanka to be a vibrant trading hub and encouraging all Sri Lankans to become co-owners of a country enriched.
13. The National Budget 2018 will support the achievement of envisaged medium-term targets such as per capita income of USD 5,000, one million new jobs, FDI inflows of USD 5 billion, and doubling exports to USD 20 billion. In 2018, we envisage a GDP growth of 5%, inflation of around 6%, and, we hope to achieve for the first time in almost 6 decades primary surplus of 1% of GDP and a Budget deficit of 4.5% of GDP.
FAST TRACKING LIBERALIZATION
14. Mr Speaker, while we introduced an open economic policy regime in 1977, in the last decade we have lost momentum, with many of our laws remaining archaic and regressive. The Customs Ordinance was first introduced in 1869. The Excise Ordinance in 1912. The Education Ordinance in 1939. This House was able to introduce a new Inland Revenue Act (IRD) recently. Much more has to be done. For example; the Rent Act, No. 7 of 1972 which limits the ownership of houses and the rent to be charged requires amendments; Paddy Lands Act, No. 1 of 1958 and the Agricultural Lands Act, No. 42 of 1973 will be amended to allow the farming of alternate crops; the Shop and Office Employees Act, No. 15 of 1954 will be amended allowing the employees flexibility in choosing their working hours; bankruptcy laws to be amended to make them more efficient. I am confident that the proposed changes will enable Sri Lanka to be a more vibrant and a dynamic market economy. (The list of the laws to be introduced, repealed and amended is included in the Technical Note)
BLUE - GREEN ECONOMY
15. Mr Speaker, in January 2016, we announced our policy of pursuing a Blue - Green development strategy. This is not only in line with our international commitments made at the Conference of Parties 2015 (COP 2015) in Paris or our commitment to achieving the 17 SDGs by 2030. But, it is more importantly a responsibility we discharge not only to ourselves, but also to the generations to come. The Blue - Green economic programme we are proposing, will generate growth by utilizing our much under-utilized ocean resources, thereby, facilitating the diversification of our economy, adopting new and sustainable technologies especially in agriculture, fisheries and manufacturing sectors. This will reduce environmental risks and ecological imbalances. As such, I propose the following:
16. Let me start with the vehicle policy. Over the years, our vehicle policy has been neither clean nor green. We propose all vehicles in the country to be powered by non-fossil fuel sources by 2040. To this end, all Government vehicles will be converted to hybrid or electric vehicles by 2025.
17. In this context, we will be introducing an appropriate incentive structure. As such, the taxes on the importation of electric vehicles including electric three wheelers, cars and buses will be reduced while rationalizing the import taxes on vehicles powered by fossil fuel. The new formula for import taxes will be based on the engine capacity which will minimize the revenue leakages.
l Mr Speaker, the import taxes on an electric car will be reduced by at least Rs. 1 million while the import tax on the high end fossil fueled cars will be increased by almost Rs. 2.5 million.
l We will also impose a special tax on super luxury vehicles with an engine capacity exceeding 2,500 cc.
l At the same time, the import taxes on a diesel three wheeler will be increased by around Rs. 50,000 in order to encourage the transition into environmentally friendly electric three wheelers.
18. The loan to value ratio for the electric busses and three wheelers will be revised to 90/10. This will be extended for domestically assembled electric three wheelers, cars and busses, as well.
19. Emission and safety standards will be introduced together with the revisions in the pre-shipment certificates on vehicle imports.
20. We will also pioneer the transformation of the public transport system by introducing 50 electric busses into the SLTB bus fleet. Private bus operators will also be incentivized to go electric. (Rs. 500 Mn)
21. Incentives will also be provided to encourage the use of off-grid solar power in establishing electric car charging stations and in agriculture and agro processing including drip irrigation, poultry, canning, plantation and, in the hotel industry. (Rs. 5,300 Mn)
22. I also propose to introduce a carbon tax where the applicable rates for a motor cycle, car and a passenger bus will be around 17 Cents, Rs. 1.78 and Rs.2.74 per day, respectively. Such funds will be channeled to protect the environment. (Rs. 75 Mn)
23. To discourage the use of Polythene and Plastic products, we will impose an excise duty of Rs. 10 per kilogramme for Plastic resins. The private sector will be incentivised to convert to environmentally friendly alternatives and to engage in manufacturing bags, packing materials etc. out of biodegradable materials such as banana fiber, palm leaves, coir, bamboo etc.
24. Customs duties will be removed for all machinery, equipment, raw materials and intermediary goods used in manufacturing of bio degradable packaging material.
25. Mr Speaker, it is time we focused on further addressing the waste disposal issue. As such:
26. Will fast track the establishment of the Aruwakkalu waste disposal and management site;
(Rs. 3,000 Mn)
27. Will support the Local Government bodies to address the solid waste issue together with the local communities and the Private sector. (Rs. 50 Mn)
28. Our river banks and soil beds have been made more vulnerable given the extreme weather conditions and as such:
29. The Kelani basin highlights the need to scale up the existing Climate Resilience Program with focus on mitigating urban flooding. As such, a flood protection wall will be constructed, in the interim. As a long term measure, new multi-purpose reservoirs will be built upstream at Wee Oya, Nawatha, Holombuwa and Reucastle to enhance the water retention capacity. A similar mechanism will be looked into with regard to other perennial rivers including, Kalu, Nilwala and Gin rivers. (Rs. 4,900 Mn)
30. Expenditure incurred by the private sector entities and NGOs to partner the Government in this effort, will be treated as qualified expenditure.
31. Ground water monitoring will continue in 2018, covering 8 districts, with the installation of monitoring equipment to cover the 3 identified river basins: Malwathu Oya, Kumbukkan Oya and Maduru Oya. This exercise will be critical in ensuring the purity and safety of water resources. (Rs. 1,500 Mn)
32. The pollution levels in some of our waterways have reached unprecedented levels. As such, the Pavithra Ganga project will be implemented. This project will focus mainly on ensuring zero disposal of waste by factories into waterways over time. In this regard, initially, all the factories that dispose of their waste into the Kelani River will be given 5 years to implement eco-sustainable modes of disposal of waste. They will be supported through a concessionary credit facility. (Rs. 750 Mn)
33. We will establish the Haritha Udyana (Eco Friendly Parks) or a green lung with a jogging track in every Pradeshiya Saba Division, and in keeping with the ancient Athenian concept of a balanced mind, body and spirit, this will include a library, gymnasium and a roof garden for yoga, meditation or other spiritual activities. (Rs. 1,500 Mn)
34. In this regard, the Nilwala Eliya model park and mega zone will be established on the left bank of the Nilwala river in Matara. (Rs. 1,500 Mn)
35. I wish to note that we will move away from the caged Zoo concept to an OpenCage concept at the Dehiwela Zoo. Pinnawela elephant orphanage will be re-organized to be Born Free Chain Free. Our elephants and other animals will no longer be caged, but be able to move around with more freedom as per international best practices. (Rs. 75 Mn)
36. We will establish a Research Institute on Elephants at Pinnawela and also initiate a programme to train Mahouts in Pinnawela financed through the Wildlife Conservation Fund (WCF). (Rs. 75 Mn)
37. We will, together with the WCF, strengthen our efforts to conserve our endemic species that are endangered such as the Loris, Fishing Cat, and Pangolin etc. (Rs. 20 Mn)
38. Proliferation of Cellular Towers is both an environmental and a health hazard. As such, we will also impose a Cellular Tower levy of Rs. 200,000 per tower per month to discourage the proliferation of such towers.
BLUE ECONOMY
39. Mr Speaker, our ocean bed is almost 26 times the size of our land mass with enormous potential. In promoting the blue economy, Governments strategy is multi-pronged with focus on building the institutional framework, harnessing the existing activities while diversifying to others without compromising its ecological balance.
40. An Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) mechanism will be developed with the participation of all stakeholders. (Rs. 25 Mn)
41. Our coastal line is faced with the risk of erosion and pollution which has had a negative impact on tourism, fisheries, transportation etc. As such, I propose to:
42. Initiate a project on Beach Replenishment from Mount Lavinia to Ratmalana which will then be expanded to create further investments, especially in Tourism and Fishery industries. (Rs. 400 Mn)
43. Invest to protect the coastal belt from Negombo to Marawila, which will include the erecting of stone hedges, cleaning and replanting mangroves. (Rs. 800 Mn)
44. Mr Speaker, there are 116 lagoons and estuaries in the country. Lagoons have a unique eco system that must be safeguarded to support climate mitigation, resilient growth and conservation. As such, during 2018, the Government will invest in 10 lagoons namely Negombo, Rekawa, Puttlam, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Nandikadal, Nayaru, Chilaw, Mundalam and Andikulama Lagoons. Such investment will be directed towards cleaning the lagoons, increasing the carrying capacity, supporting the existing livelihoods of fisherman and Research and Development. (Rs. 1,000 Mn)
45. I also wish to note that the hotels and other industries that dispose of their waste into the lagoons will be assisted invest in technology to ensure zero discharge of waste into the lagoons. (Rs. 250 Mn)
46. Our Government is pursuing the extension of the continental shelf which will complement our blue growth strategy. To strengthen this effort, a fully equipped permanent Secretariat will be established. (Rs. 25 Mn)
47. We will establish a virtual Blue - Green- Institute as the Coordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation (COSTI) which will create and sustain spinout programs identified under the Blue - Green initiative. (Rs. 25 Mn)
ENCOURAGING SUSTAINABLE AGRI AND FISHERY VENTURES
48. Mr Speaker, unsustainable agricultural practices adopted over time have resulted in low productivity, degradation of the soil, compromising the quality of water and water sources. Clearly, a paradigm shift is needed to transit into more eco-friendly agriculture practices. This will not only benefit our environment, but also open new export markets, given the increasing awareness and the price, especially the developed markets are willing to pay for produce from ethical farming and eco-friendly practices. As such, I propose the following:
49. To strengthen the eco-certification programme to facilitate access to export markets. (Rs. 25 Mn)
50. In continuing with the Presidents initiative, we will desilt small and medium tanks in a systematic manner in harvesting rainwater. This project will commence mainly in North Western, North, and North Central Provinces. (Rs. 1,000)
51. To complete the construction of 3 warehouses for storage of agricultural produce, in Polonnaruwa, Ratnapura and Kilinochichi and to uplift the existing warehouses operating on trust receipt basis, budgetary allocation provided will be further enhanced. These warehouses operating on trust receipt basis benefit the farmers as it facilitates the stabilization of the farmers income. (Rs. 250 Mn)
52. Farmers are constantly at the mercy of the weather Gods and successive Governments have been doling out funds to the farmers whenever there has been a drought or floods in an indiscriminate manner. It is in this context that the weather indexed insurance scheme has been designed. The insurance cover will be a minimum of Rs. 40,000 per acre for 6 crops including paddy and other 5 emerging crops such as Maize, Soya, Big Onion, Potato, and Chilli. This will be a contributory scheme with the premium being borne by both the farmer and the Government. The Government will invest Rs. 3,000 million in 2018. (Rs. 3,000 Mn)
53. To support such ventures, we will also upgrade the Department of Meteorology with the state of the art technology and elevate the capacity of the personnel. All raw data that is collected by the Department of Meteorology will be made available free of charge to the general public from the 1st of January 2018. (Rs. 200 Mn)
54. Degradation of soil has become a significant issue in improving productivity. As such, SLINTEC, ITI and the National Science Foundation (NSF) will be supported to engage in developing fertilizer, soil management practices etc. to rehabilitate and improve such degraded soil. (Rs. 50 Mn)
55. We will also exempt NBT on the import of selected equipment including greenhouse technology that enables advanced technology agriculture practices.
56. Backward integrated activities related to agriculture will be taxed at the concessional Income Tax rate of 14%.
57. Our support to the fisheries industry will be as follows:
58. Will bear, 50% of the cost of introducing technology such as refrigerated storage to mitigate post-harvest losses in multi-day boats, (Rs. 175 Mn)
59. Will bear, 50% of the cost of multi-day boats of more than 55 feet long so as to encourage deep sea fishing. (Rs. 400 Mn)
60. Will develop and upgrade the anchorages and landing sites of fishery harbors while also investing to improve Chilaw, Mirissa, Karainagar and Purana Wella fishery harbours. (Rs. 1,750 Mn)
61. We will also develop the Gandara Fishery harbor together with a new fishery harbor in Wellamankara in the Mannar District. (Rs. 200 Mn)
62. We will continue the Wewak Sahitha Gamak programme and will improve fishery villages in coastal areas which were initiated in 2017. (Rs. 450 Mn)
63. A Milk Fish Hatchery and a Marine Ornamental Fish Hatchery will be established in Bangadeniya. (Rs. 100 Mn)
64. Given the high demand for processed Sea Cucumbers in the export market which garners about USD 1,000 per Kg, a dedicated buffer zone will be established in Poonakery in the Kilinochchi District where the private sector will be given plots to harvest and process Sea Cucumbers.
65. The infrastructure facilities of the model Aquaculture Industrial Park in the
Batticaloa District will be completed. Similar parks to be established in Mannar and Hambanthota Districts. (Rs. 250 Mn)
ENTERPRISE SRI LANKA
66. Sri Lanka has long been trading with the rest of the world and has had renowned domestic businessmen, entrepreneurs, and wealthy people. The historical records reveal evidence on maritime trade links that the country had with China, North Africa, West Asia, as well as European countries.
67. Archeological studies conducted in the areas of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mannar, Jaffna and the Southern parts of the country have found coins from Burma, China, Egypt, Rome and Venice establishing that we have been trading with both the orient and the occident for a long time.
68. Further, historical records prove that wealthy Sri Lankans have bought some of the most expensive horse breeds from Alexandria, and that there has been a great demand for Sri Lankan pearls and gems, ivory and spices not only from China, but also from the Roman Empire and the Pharaohs of Egypt. Such evidence establishes that Sri Lanka has been a trading centre.
69. Hence, our goal is to rebuild the Paradise of Entrepreneurs capitalizing on the inborn business skills historically possessed by Sri Lankans. If Sri Lanka is to succeed in its journey forward, it is imperative that all Sri Lankans, not just the private sector, become stakeholders of the Enterprise Sri Lanka initiative.
70. The responsibility of a Government is not to be in business but to create a level playing field and providing all citizens equal opportunities for success.
71. Hence, Enterprise Sri Lanka will facilitate not only the established private sector, but also the small time businessmen and the small retailer running a kade, self-employed three wheeler drivers, women who run small businesses and youths driving tech startups to be the engine of growth in our economic model.
72. It is true that not everyone may succeed in a competitive market environment, and those who do not succeed shall not be overlooked. Hence, the Government will ensure a robust social safety nets mechanism that supports those who will be at risk.
73. Today, like never before, there exists an abundance of opportunities to succeed with the help of modern technology. We know with certainty that our youth not only possess the required knowledge, technology and plans, but also the will and the courage. Therefore, of a Government whose vision is to develop the country, should be not to give away a piece of fish and make people economically handicapped and entirely Government dependent, but to give them a fishing rod and create a means of living in order to meet their expectations. Also, the Government should support the journey of success that the country can be proud of its citizens being honoured and esteemed. In this regard, our strategy is as follows:
CREATING THE NEXT GENERATION OF LOCAL ENTREPRENEURS
74. The SME sector must be the backbone of our economy. However, the lack of capital or the difficulty in accessing capital due to both the cost of capital and the requirement for collateral have been main impediments in the development of startups and SMEs. Our objective is to ensure that no entrepreneur is ever denied credit due to the lack of collateral, but is able to access financing given the viability of the project proposal. In fact, a good business idea will be given the pride of place. To this end, we will also facilitate the establishment of a Development Bank with an EXIM window, to enable the much desired long term financing for our private sector ventures. Until the Bank is established, we will continue with the targeted, existing and the proposed loan schemes. (Rs. 10,000 Mn)
75. In 2017, we introduced 8 credit schemes on low interest rates to support the SMEs and Micro level entrepreneurs. These schemes will be further strengthened and continued with almost Rs. 15,000 million being disbursed. These, together with other Government assisted existing and proposed credit schemes, will be collectively named as the Enterprise Sri Lanka Credit Scheme. The Government will bear the interest subsidy on these schemes. (Rs. 750 Mn)
76. It is in this context that the Government, in line with the Grama Shakthi initiative of the President which is part of the national poverty and unemployment eradication drive, has decided to extend support mainly to the farmers, fisherman, youth and women who are already engaged in small businesses, individually or as a community to harness their entrepreneurial capacities. At the same time, the Presidents initiative of introducing development programmes to address the regional issues will be further strengthened. (Rs. 2,200Mn)
77. During 2018-2020, we will support the formation of 50 agro and fishery companies, 25 majority women owned companies, and 150 youth centric startups. These companies will have at least 10 equity shareholders and each shareholder, will have invested at least Rs. 10,000. The Government will extend a comprehensive support package which includes both non-financial and financial assistance including grants and the credit through the Enterprise Sri Lanka Credit Scheme to these companies. (Rs. 500 Mn)
78. In order to encourage women entrepreneurs, Enterprise Sri Lanka Credit Scheme will make available credit facilities with the interest subsidy being at least 10% more for women entrepreneurs relative to others. (Rs. 50 Mn)
79. The differently abled will also be eligible to access the Enterprise Sri Lanka Credit
Scheme with the interest subsidy being at least 15% more relative to others encouraging their entrepreneurial skills to be harnessed. (Rs. 15 Mn)
80. We will also establish a SME Guarantee Fund which will further augment the SMEs capacity to borrow given that it will be considered as collateral. (Rs. 500 Mn)
81. We will also continue the Erambuma Credit Scheme which supports the startups with a credit facility of Rs. 1.5 million per annum per idea per person with a Government Guarantee. (Rs. 25 Mn)
82. The IT and the IT related sectors have the potential to reach USD 5 billion in export earnings in the next 5 years. As such, to support this industry, specially the SME IT companies, we will launch, the IT Initiative, which is in effect the Governments angel fund for the IT industry. This initiative will be operated through the EDB and we will invest Rs. 3 billion in the next 5 years to support:
l The local startups and to attract foreign startups,
l Small and Medium sized IT Companies, and
l Create the enabling environment by supporting establishment of Incubators, supporting the acquisition and augmentation of skills and knowhow in collaboration with the local universities etc.
(Rs. 300 Mn)
83. The IT Initiative will at the outset finance the following:
l 50% of the Rent expenditure for 24 months on the Hatch Incubator and similar support to any such private ventures in the future, as well.
l The Universities of Colombo and Moratuwa and, SLIIT will conduct training courses on Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Data Science, Machine Learning, Python Development etc. in collaboration with the industry. Employment for those who successfully follow such courses will be guaranteed by the private sector. The cost of these courses will be shared between the industry and the proposed IT Initiative.
84. The SME Guarantee Fund will be extended to the IT Initiative and the exporters who require support, as well.
FROM LOCAL ENTREPRENEURS TO GLOBAL LEADERS
83. Mr Speaker, while commending our private sector ventures for having penetrated into the international arena, much more needs to be done. We have tried many strategies including protecting local industries through tariffs. We have legislations that do not allow foreign investments in certain sectors. Perhaps, most of all, our complex labour laws and bureaucracy have unwittingly obstructed foreign enterprises from entering into the country, thereby, preventing the much needed competition for the local industries. Trade reforms are integral to national competitiveness. Let me say this, competition breeds success. It tests our limits and forces innovation. As such, let me assure our local private sector, our Governments policy of entering into Free Trade Agreements (FTA) and the removals of para-tariffs should not be viewed as a threat to our local industries.
l The para-tariffs applicable on the tariff lines which do not at present carry any Customs duties will be abolished within the next 3 years, in keeping with our policy of liberalizing and globalizing.
l Last year, we removed over 100 applicable para-tariffs on import items and in this year, we will remove almost another 1,200 para tariff. (The list is available in the technical note). However, while we will be phasing out the para-tariffs, which are also in line with our WTO commitments, such action will be followed by way of a trade adjustment programme in the interim period that will provide relief and support to the local private sector to adjust to this new system.
l We will further support the local industries with the introduction of strong Anti-Dumping and Countervailing laws together with strengthened Consumer Protection laws while also augmenting the National Quality Infrastructure.
86. At the same time, we will also introduce anti-competitive laws addressing Mergers and Monopolies practices to ensure that the private sector can be better facilitated to grow through scale and yet ensure a level playing field in which both the industrys growth and the rights of the consumer are protected.
87. In supporting our private sector while focusing on strengthening the potential industries as identified in the National Export Strategy we will support those industries that have already accessed the international markets to grow and those industries that have yet not accessed the international markets but has the capacity to do so.
88. We will introduce an Export Market Access Support programme as part of the Trade Adjustment programme which will support our local companies that already have exports of less than USD 10 million per annum and potential new entrants to the export market to better access the global value chains. This programme will facilitate:

89. To meet the cost of compliance which includes the cost of provision of free samples, intellectual property registration, insurance and promotional costs undertaken overseas.
90. To support in meeting the cost of rent of retail shop space or shelf space occupied by domestic brands that go overseas for a period of 36 months. We will allocate Rs. 800 million for the Export Market Access Support programme. (Rs. 800 Mn)
91. Product development assistance to exporters including the transfer of technology and knowhow will be facilitated through the Enterprise Sri Lanka Credit scheme.
92. The proposed SME Guarantee Fund will enable SME Exporters who are in the CRIB but have the potential to export, yet has no access to finance its operations, to access financing from Banks utilizing the SME guarantees.
93. In line with our policy of strengthening the National Quality Infrastructure, the testing facilities at the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI), Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI), National Quarantine Center, National Aquatic Research Agency and similar agencies will be upgraded to be on par with international certification bodies. This will facilitate our products to be acceptable in the global markets and to facilitate the proposed import inspection and facilitation scheme. (Rs. 250 Mn)
94. The National Intellectual Property Office will also be upgraded and better resourced. (Rs. 25 Mn)
95. In order to meet the growing demand and to facilitate Business to Consumer e-commerce transactions (B to C), the BoI and the Customs Department will establish a procedure by 1st January 2018, to effect such transactions.
96. Let me focus on the logistics hub which includes front end services, Multi Country Consolidation, Warehouses, Entrepot Trading and Off Shore Businesses which have immense potential. However, if we are to exploit this potential in full, certain amendments to regulations will have to be effected. Such amendments will consist of the liberalization of the existing investment regime with the inclusion of working capital, expansion of designated areas and introduction of updated operating guidelines.
97. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act, No. 51 of 1979 and the Merchants Shipping Act, No. 52 of 1971 will be amended to cater to the demands of the modern day logistics and marine industry. This will also ensure healthy competition, an independent Ports regulator will be introduced. Restrictions on the foreign ownership on the shipping and the freight forwarding agencies will be lifted. This will enable major international shipping lines and logistics operators to base their operations in Sri Lanka.
98. The Government will drive a comprehensive Multi-National Corporation Outreach programme (MNC Outreach) to attract global Electronic and Electrical Machinery (EEM) players into the country to create value chain linkages or joint ventures with Sri Lankan EEM exporters. (Rs. 25 Mn)
99. We will grant tax concessions on imported capital goods through bonding facilities during the construction period for large scale pharmaceutical investments, dairy industry and solid waste management ventures.
100. The EDB, supported by institutions such as Sri Lanka Customs, Department of Commerce etc., will establish a trade portal (E trade Information Platform) that will allow the exporters to access reliable trade information on time and trade promotional tools including trade statistics, regulatory requirements, export/import procedures etc. (Rs. 25 Mn)
101. The COSTI will be converted into the National Science Technology & Innovation Coordinating Authority (NASTICA) which will be dedicated to convert research into commercial ventures. (Rs. 25 Mn)
102. We will also introduce the Innovators to Industry (I2I) initiative. I2I will facilitate and support the matching of the best and the brightest creative minds with our industries. In fact, this will benefit both the innovators and the industry. (Rs. 25 Mn)
103. Last year, we supported Product Design Engineering (PDE) through the establishment of a fund. We will continue to support the PDE initiative through the Mechatronic Enabled Economic Development Initiative (MEDI) which will consist of the shared services in Standards, Training, Prototyping and Test Facility (SPTF) and the Long Term Loan Facility (LTLF). (Rs. 350 Mn)
104. The Center for Robotics will be further strengthened while supporting the Public Innovation Spaces. (Rs. 50 Mn)
105. The boat building industry has been identified to have significant potential as an export industry while paving the way for nautical tourism. As such, we will introduce the necessary regulations to facilitate this industry to grow, including the introduction of a system for standardization and quality assurance and, will also create dedicated industry zones in Trincomalee and Koggala, facing the waterfront. We will exempt the upfront payment of NBT and PAL applicable on the sale of yachts built by BoI companies to the local BoI charter companies. (Rs. 100 Mn)
106. The country still has a competitive advantage in the spice and concentrates industry. Our support will be as follows:
107. Stringent regulations will be imposed to ensure good quality products protecting the Sri Lankan identity.
108. The Cinnamon and the Pepper industry will be supported for value addition and to increase production, by providing incentives to increase the production of high quality planting materials in 1,000 nurseries. (Rs. 50 Mn)
109. Activities will be strengthened at the Cinnamon Training College. (Rs. 50 Mn)
110. A revenue model for the Tea industry will be developed in the medium term.
111. We will strengthen assistance to Tea small holders to improve productivity. (Rs. 250 Mn)
112. Given the issues faced by the domestic Coconut producers, NBT on domestic Coconut oil and kernal products will be removed for a period of 1 year. At the same time, I also propose the following:
113. We will introduce regulations to ensure mandatory packaging and labeling and standardization of quality in compliance with international quality standards for all Coconut kernel products.
114. Will support the Coconut Research Institute to produce Hybrid Coconut Seedlings to meet the demand from growers. (Rs. 25 Mn)
115. The implementation of the Rubber Master Plan which has been drawn up with industry input has 22 different projects covering the raw material base and manufacturing with a heavy focus on product innovation and infusion of new technology will be supported. (Rs. 50 Mn)
116. The Poultry industry is a key part of the countrys agro industrialization strategy given its capacity to be a significant export earner. As such:
117. The import of maize will be liberalized provided that such imports will be made only to meet any gap created due to a lack of domestic production of maize.
118. Will provide on lease basis underutilized state farms or land suitable for this industry to develop modern poultry farms with a view to increase the live birds stock from 110 million to 500 million per year.
119. It is envisaged that our fruits especially Pineapples and Bananas will have significant export potential arising from the proposed FTAs. As such, to meet the demand for these fruits, we will support the Horana and Makandura Research Centres and the Institute of Agro- Technologies and Rural Sciences to develop high yielding plants using micro propagation methods and disseminate the necessary technologies. Concurrently, we will also support the Wayamba University in establishing a Center for Food, Technology, Research and Training focusing on sectors including the Dairy industry.. (Rs. 125 Mn)
120. Considering the growing demand for Sri Lankan floriculture products in the global markets, we will support this industry to improve infrastructure including the establishment of a Flower Council to access new markets. (Rs. 10 Mn)
121. The Gem and Jewelry industry has significant export potential. Sri Lankas Lapidary industry is considered as one of the best service cutting stations catering to a high end clientele. As such, to boost the industry:
122. The NBT on the gem stones imported for service cutting and to re-export will be exempted.
123. National Gem & Jewelry Authoritys structure and polices will be revamped so as to facilitate the industrys growth potential including upgrading the lab facilities.
124. The potential in the Timber and Timber based products is enormous but remains very much underutilized. As such, we will establish a Design Center for Timber and Timber based products in collaboration with the University of Moratuwa. Rs. 25 Mn
STIMULATING THE TOURISM INDUSTRY
125. The Tourism industry remains a vibrant industry. Tourism arrivals are estimated to increase by almost 3 fold to 4.5 million by 2020. The country has much to offer given its Natural Beauty, Heritage, Cuisine and Culture. As such, our support to the Industry is as follows:
126. The increase in tourists warrants extra rooms apart from the hotel rooms that are already being constructed. In this context, mechanisms such as the Homestay programme will be encouraged. A special credit facility will be introduced to upgrade such facilities. (Rs. 10 Mn)
127. In order to establish a level playing field for tourist service providers in both formal and informal sectors, it is suggested to register all tourist service providers with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Agency (SLTDA) and to bring the informal sector in to the broader tax net. It is further suggested that the Online Travel Agents (OTAs) in the tourism industry (both resident and non-resident) which derive their commission from the businesses carried out in Sri Lanka, and in line with global best practices, we will impose a tax of 1% on the commission derived or accrued by OTAs from reservations in Sri Lanka.
128. The para-tariffs imposed on certain imported food and beverages will be removed. (The list is included in the Technical note).
129. The liquor licensing fee structure will be rationalized. License issuance mechanism will be revamped with a view to promoting tourism, especially in Guest houses, Boutique Hotels etc. A tax file number will be one of the essential requirements when issuing these licenses.
130. We will focus on developing a few anchor sites for tourism in collaboration with the SLTDA and the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB) and, this will include:
131. The development of 6 Forts in Matara, Hambantota, Batticaloa, Fort Fredrick in Trincomalee, Mannar Fort/Doric House and in Kalpitiya in collaboration with the Archeological Department and the private sector. (Rs. 250 Mn)
132. The railway stations such as Nanu Oya, Colombo Fort, Galle and Ella will be declared as Archeological sites and modernized to give a better rail commuter experience preserving its original architectural identity in collaboration with the private sector. (Rs. 75 Mn)
133. The domestic airports at Sigiriya, Batticaloa, China Bay and Koggala will be developed as PPPs to support tourism.
134. Suitable areas will be identified for aero sports. This will have defined 3 dimensional boundaries and be demarcated as open skies for aero sports including Hang Gliding, Ballooning, Dirigibles, Parachutes and Para  Gliders The NBT and PAL will be removed on the import of non-powered equipment.
135. The Maduru Oya and Gal Oya National Parks will be developed to support high end safaris etc. The Park rangers will be capacitated to support not only conservation and protection functions but also those related to tourism, as well. (Rs. 75 Mn)

141. Mr Speaker, the 1.3 million strong three wheeler driving community in the country, plays a significant part in our daily lives. Increasingly, the Sri Lankan tuk tuk has become a tourist attraction, as well. As such, this Budget while already providing incentives for tuk tuk to go electric, we will further support the creation of tuktuk entrepreneurs.
142. The SLTDA and SLTPB will initiate a programme to introduce a Tourist Friendly tuk tuk where the tuk tuk drivers will be trained in collaboration with the hospitality industry, to be tourist guides and register them with the Bureau. A special sticker issued by the SLTPB will be displayed on the tuk tuks once the drivers have successfully completed these courses which will be offered free of charge. (Rs. 50 Mn)
143. We will also establish the three wheeler regulatory authority and regulations have already been issued to make meters mandatory for all. (Rs. 25 Mn)
ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENTS
144. Mr Speaker, for a middle income country, we have not been able to attract FDIs in the same scale as our neighbors. Many issues ails us. Therefore, our processes must be relooked at and benchmarked against the best. It is in this context that I wish to propose the following:
145. The Department of the Registrar of Companies as part of its business re-engineering process, will establish a One Stop Shop for business registration through the introduction of a single identification system and introduce a system to scan and digitize company records, create a database of trademarks, etc. using its own funds.
146. We will also introduce an E-local Government application system, automated construction permit issuing mechanism, integrated Land Registry (eLR), digitized 45 Land Registers, and establish a National Single Window connecting 31 State agencies with the Customs Department. (Rs. 500 Mn)
147. As I already mentioned, we will remove restrictions that limit the land ownership rights of listed companies with foreign ownership together with the restrictions on foreigners ability to purchase condominiums below the 4th floor.
148. Rojana Industries of Thailand will be establishing an Industrial Park at Milleniya with an investment of USD 500 million. The Government has already provided this venture with land and will also provide the necessary infrastructure such as electricity, water, access roads etc. up to the Zone. Similar support will be extended to the proposed Industrial Zones in Bingiriya, and Charlemont Estate, Weligama. The BoI, the relevant line agencies and the newly established PPP Unit at my Ministry will collaborate in facilitating such ventures. (Rs. 2,500 Mn)
149. Work has commenced on the establishment of the Hi-Tech Innovation Park in Mahahenawatte, Pitipana. This park will host, initially, 6 industries from the Bio-Pharma sector and 15 more industries will be established, subsequently. (Rs. 100 Mn)
150. Mr Speaker, Budgetary constraints have limited our investment portfolio. In this context, PPP is a conduit that enables investments in infrastructure without compromising our ability to maintain a robust social safety network. As such, we have established a special Unit under my Ministry, which will be the single facilitation point for all stakeholders in designing and implementing PPPs. We will be issuing PPP guidelines, shortly. We will pursue PPPs in a wide variety of sectors covering transport and highways, power, ports, water supply, healthcare, education, housing, agri-business, retail and minerals. (Rs. 50 Mn)
HARNESSING OUR YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS
151. If Enterprise Sri Lanka is to succeed, the youth of our country must be made stakeholders of this national venture. All our young people, whatever their social and education status may be, must be given equal opportunities to succeed and utilize their respective talents to the maximum. Every year, nearly 300,000 sit for the Advanced Level (A/L) and out of which only around 30,000 will enter our national universities. Of the 200,000 A/L students, around 10,000 from financially better off families will go abroad and another 60,000 students will be entering non-Governmental degree awarding higher education institutions. This leaves almost another 200,000 with various skills and abilities, hopeless and frustrated. However, the rigidities and our failure to effect significant reforms in our education system, have resulted in the system being unable to recognize the uniqueness of each of our students. The system has failed the student and not the student. The unique talents of many of these youth can be harnessed and utilized for the betterment of the country. In fact, their energy and their ideas must be the engines which make Sri Lanka grow. In this context, the Governments strategy is as follows:
 13 years of Education - Invest in primary and secondary education to ensure that young people will get 13 years of education irrespective of the outcome at O/Ls in a stream of their choice with the emphasis on vocational and skills training.
 World Class University Education - Invest in university education with focus on modern curricula, research facilities and standardization.
 Market Oriented Vocational Training - Invest in developing vocational training institutions to develop high quality market oriented training programmes.
152. Our three pronged approach will ensure that no youth will be left behind within the Enterprise Sri Lanka vision.

153. A common issue faced by our youth in navigating the job market is that they do not possess the required skill set as demanded by the market. Therefore, we propose to implement a programme where groups of youth will undergo 3-6 month training courses in a specific skill set as demanded by the private sector. We will establish the Employment Preparation Fund at the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs which will finance
l The cost of such training courses to be made available
l The cost of the stipend to be paid during the training period amounting to Rs. 3,500 per month
l A portion of the monthly allowance up to Rs. 6,000 for a period of 6 months and the partner employer will pay a further allowance of Rs. 10,000. (Rs. 2,500 Mn)
154. The National Youth Corps has undertaken several skill development programmes and these will be further strengthened by allocating Rs. 2,000 million. (Rs. 2,000 Mn)
155. In addition to the German Technical Colleges in Ratmalana and Kilinnochchi and the one to be built in Matara, we will also establish 5 Technical and Vocational schools in Badulla, Kandy, Trincomalee, Ratnapura and Anuradhapura in the next 3 years with technical inputs from the Swiss and the German Governments. These Technical schools will provide world class training in hospitality management, civil, electrical and motor mechanical engineering etc. (Rs. 1,000 Mn)
156. A University College will be established in Kinniya for advanced training opportunities for youth. (Rs. 50 Mn)
SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE
157. Mr Speaker, unlike any other time in history, our Government ensured an unprecedented level of resource allocation to Social infrastructure including Education, Health, and Youth empowerment. Investments in Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education alone will amount to over Rs. 325 billion in 2018. Our strategy is to move away from brick and mortar investments to quality improvements, which will be a more sustainable strategy to reap better dividends. As such I propose the following:
13 YEARS OF EDUCATION
158. Mr Speaker, let me state this at the outset itself. We have delivered on the promise of introducing the Student Insurance Scheme and have provided Tablets for our students. The President and the Prime Minister have clearly stated many a time that education is a key component of the countrys development strategy and, therefore, will not compromise resource allocation to its development. Hence, the Budget for education is structured on the objective of providing 13 Years of Education. Such reforms will also focus on improving the ratio of Science, Technology, Engineering and Medicine (STEM) to Non-STEM graduates in the country. As such: (Rs. 3,500 Mn)
159. The National Institute of Education (NIE) will be restructured to partner the demand for serious reforms in the primary and secondary education. The focus of the reforms will include the:
160. Change in the methodology of teaching of STEM subjects.
161. Proposed change in the A/L subject combinations ensuing degree programmes, as well, in line with the STEM+A (Arts) concept. This will allow students to offer combinations such as Mathematics with Music, Science with Drama etc. at A/Ls which will produce students with attributes essential to the modern day demands.
162. The examination and assessment methodology will also be reformed to suit 13 years of Education.
163. In reforming the curricula, as required, we will also provide the students with math kits and upgrade the mathematics laboratories.
164. Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) will be introduced to facilitate the testing of our education system in comparison to the global standards by testing the skills and knowledge of students. (Rs. 25 Mn)
165. In preparing our students for tomorrows jobs, we will introduce Genomics, Coding, Robotics and Nanosceince into our school curricula.
166. Continuous Professional Development (CPD) for Teachers will be continued. (Rs. 1,200 Mn)
167. The Smart Class Room concept will be strengthened as part of our digitalization drive, together with the development of e-text books. (Rs. 755 Mn)
168. A center dedicated to training Teachers in the English Language will be established at the College of Education at Maharagama. It is expected that given its proximity to the NIE, resources will be shared between the NIE and the proposed Center for English education creating synergies. (Rs. 50 Mn)
169. We will further strengthen the training of teachers of special needs students. In this context, the special needs training facilities at Hapitigama and Adalachchenai Colleges of Education will be upgraded. (Rs. 25 Mn)
170. The allowance paid to the students in National Colleges of Education will be increased up to a maximum of Rs. 5,000 per month from an average of Rs. 3,500 per month. (Rs. 50 Mn)
WORLD CLASS UNIVERSITY EDUCATION
171. Mr Speaker, although the Governments investment in the university education has increased, it is disappointing to note the work of various disruptive forces in our University system which has held the future of our brightest and the best to ransom. In fact, it is the future of our country that is being held to ransom. However, this Government is determined to open up new opportunities for our youth. To this end, while increasing the university intake by almost 20% in the last 2 years, especially, in subjects including Technology, Engineering, Medicine, and selected degree programmes in Management and Social Sciences we have also improved the physical infrastructure facilities of the universities. As such:
172. Will establish State medical faculties at Wayamba, Sabaragamuwa and Moratuwa Universities to expand medical education. (Rs. 1,250 Mn)
173. A Professorial unit at the Karapitiya hospital to complement the expansion of the medical faculty at the Ruhuna University. (Rs. 50 Mn)
174. Expand the technology degree programmes in subjects such as Information and Communication Technology, Engineering Technology and Bio Systems Technology in 7 new technology faculties which include, the Universities of Rajarata, Ruhuna, Sabaragamuwa, Kelaniya, Colombo, Sri Jayewardenepura and the South Eastern University. (Rs. 5,000 Mn)
175. Will establish a Centre for Naval Studies and Shipping at the Ruhuna University. (Rs. 250 Mn)
176. Will support the Colombo Universitys initiative to collaborate with the industry needs and venture into new streams such as Data Science, Big Data analytics, Actuarial studies, Business analytics etc. (Rs. 250 Mn)
177. The Vavuniya Campus of the Jaffna University will also be strengthened to include a state of the art library facility and an IT center. (Rs. 200 Mn)
178. We will also facilitate the State universities to offer internal off site degree programmes in properly regulated and accredited private institutions.
179. An independent quality assurance and accreditation mechanism which is essential to maintain standards and quality of the provision of higher education will be established. (Rs. 25 Mn)
180. The University of Sri Jayewardenepuras Management Faculty will be supported to seek the accreditation of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) enabling the university to benchmark against the global competitors. I encourage other Universities to also follow suit. (Rs. 100 Mn)
181. The relevant Statutes governing UGC approved universities will be amended to own patents and, remove restrictions on licensing them and owning shares in companies that exploit or license such patents.
182. Although we have a rich indigenous medical system, it has been neglected and is faced with extinction. As such, a Post Graduate Institute of Indigenous Medicine will be established. (Rs. 40 Mn)
183. I propose to increase the eligibility criteria of the household income threshold from Rs. 300,000 to Rs. 500,000 per annum for the Mahapola Scholarship scheme. This will benefit an extra 3,000 students. (Rs. 75 Mn)
184. We will also finance a health insurance scheme for all university students. (Rs. 100 Mn)
SPORTS ACTIVITIES
185. Mr Speaker, sports have the twin impact of building a sense of social cohesion and social capital whilst ensuring that the country achieves recognition in the international arena.
186. As such, we will popularize community sports and to support this initiative we will develop 100 rural playgrounds throughout the country. (Rs. 100 Mn)
187. The Talent Identification programme has now enabled us to create pools of talent of budding young athletes at District and Provincial levels, thus, becoming the main feeding point into the National Pool. As such, to promote sports at the District and Provincial levels, we plan to uplift the District and Provincial sports stadiums. As such, initially, the Digana sports stadium, the Polonnaruwa District stadium and the Sandankeni sports stadium in Kalmunai will be developed during the next 2 years. The Matale Hockey Ground, which is in a dilapidated state, will be rehabilitated. (Rs. 400 Mn)
188. Sri Lanka has the honour of hosting the South Asia Games (SAG) in 2020.

190. The pavilion and the tracks at the Sugathadasa Outdoor Stadium will also be upgraded to international standards. (Rs. 1,200)
191. The Human Performance laboratory will be equipped with state of the art facilities. (Rs. 75 Mn)
192. The issue of performance enhancing drugs has permeated into the countrys sports arena, as well. This is quite shameful. As such, we will support the implementation of a national awareness programme on anti-doping and the establishment of a drug testing and research laboratory. (Rs. 25 Mn)
193. I understand that the cost of sports shoes has become a major impediment in attracting our village youth into competitive sports. Therefore, I wish to propose that the para-tariffs imposed on import of sports shoes be removed.
194. We will also support our Veterans and the differently abled who represent the country in international sports competitions such as the Asian Masters Championships, Paralympics etc . (Rs. 50 M)
A HEALTHY NATION
195. Mr Speaker, the investment in the Health Sector by our Government has been significant. We have delivered on the promises of providing medicine at an affordable cost.

We will rationalize the tax structure based on a formula linked to the alcohol content and type. Further, NBT will be imposed on liquor with effect from 1st April 2018.
A HOME OWNING SOCIETY AND CREATING URBAN HUBS
215. Mr Speaker, our vision is to ensure that every citizen becomes a home owner. As such, we have already commenced a number of programmes addressing the low and middle income segments of the society, the Estate community, relocation of victims of landslides and the resettlement of our citizens affected by the conflict in the North and the East. In this regard, I wish to inform the following:
216. We will provide 20,000 housing units under the Urban Regeneration Project (URP) by 2020 for the low income segment in the country. By now 2017, 5,856 of such units have already been completed. Given the Governments commitment to accelerating these projects, Rs. 17.5 billion will be allocated in 2018. These projects have already commenced in Angoda, Kolonnawa, Maligawatte and Dematagoda. (Rs. 17,500 Mn)
217. Lack of proper housing facilities in the North and the East is a key concern of the Government in ensuring the resettlement of those displaced during the conflict. In this regard, we have already initiated a programme to construct houses during 2018-2020. (Rs. 3,000 Mn)
218. The plantation sector has consistently been one of the biggest contributors to our export income. Yet, their quality of life has remained under par. We will facilitate the shift from the line rooms to a house and for which 25,000 houses will be provided in the medium term. (Rs. 2,000 Mn)
219. Rural housing needs will be addressed through an owner driven housing scheme and also to support improvements to the houses. (Rs. 7,000 Mn)
220. With the fast growing middle income group in the country, the demand for affordable housing needs Governments intervention, especially in the emerging urban hubs. The Urban Development Authority (UDA) and the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) have undertaken several projects in Borella, Kottawa, Wadduwa, Homagama and Ragama and will further expand this programme. We will support this venture with a low interest credit scheme, specially targeting the first time home buyers. (Rs. 500 Mn)

221. Given our Governments commitment to sustainable development and creating modern sustainable Urban Hub, Rs. 24 billion will be allocated for URP: a multipurpose initiative, which includes an integrated flood mitigation mechanism to cover the Colombo city limits and its suburbs including Weras Ganga project, the relocation of the Manning Market to Peliyagoda, Administrative City Development project, development of Ancillary Infrastructure for the Colombo Port City, Transport Development project, Beira Lake Rehabilitation and Redevelopment project and, the provision of Road Infrastructure for the Tec-City at Homagama. (Rs. 24,000 Mn)
222. Mr Speaker, our development model is not limited to only the Colombo District and its suburbs, but it is an inclusive development strategy that encompasses all 25 Districts in the country. As such, the township and strategic city development programme will initially cover Kandy, Anuradhapura, Galle and the Jaffna Districts. (Rs. 12,000 Mn)
223. The master plan for greater Kalmunai and Samanthurai has already been drawn up. We will extend support to implement key projects identified in the master plan. Funds will be allocated to uplift small and medium townships, especially in the lagging regions of the country with modern amenities. (Rs. 2,000 Mn)
224. We will complement the financing for the Central Expressway project. (Rs. 10,000 Mn)

226. Given the success of the pilot implementation of the Serisera or the Touch Travel card programme, we will support the expansion of this led by the SLTB to cover the private sector as well. To further support this initiative, the combined timetable for bus transport, will be implemented.
CREATING A SECURE ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL
227. Mr Speaker, in ensuring security in the country asymmetric threats including cyber terrorism, financial crimes, drugs and human trafficking are the emerging issues. It is incumbent upon us to ensure that our security forces are properly capacitated with not only hard infrastructure but also with soft infrastructure including the ability to access information not only within the country but also collaborate with our neighbors without infringing on the privacy of our people. Therefore, resources will be allocated as follows:
228. Community policing has been identified to be a key element in the Police reform process especially in positioning Sri Lanka Police as a professional, people friendly law enforcement agency. (Rs. 100 Mn)
229. A Police and Criminal Justice University, a brainchild of the Prime Minister will be established. This will focus on areas of Human Rights, International Law, Security, Criminology, Forensics, Investigational and Intelligence Analytics. (Rs. 125 Mn)
230. The Cyber Crime Investigation Unit of the Sri Lanka Police will be strengthened while upgrading the Police Information and Communication Systems to meet the modern day demands. (Rs. 440 Mn)
231. The UN has commended the work of our Peace Keeping Forces and has requested Sri Lanka to increase its participation in this effort. As such, we will implement special training and development courses for Sri Lankan Soldiers to participate at the UN Peace Keeping missions. (Rs. 750 Mn)
LEGAL REFORMS
232. Mr Speaker, I note that our courts are overwhelmed with cases due to both the shortage of Judges and staff and, physical infrastructure. The delay in dispute resolution has created a frustration not only amongst our civil society but has also become a hindrance in enforcing contracts, thereby, increasing the cost of doing business in the country. This demands investment in judicial infrastructure. In this background, I propose the following:
233. In order to clear the enormous backlog of cases pending in our courts on offences including financial crimes, corruption and organized crimes, we will support the establishment of specialized high courts. To expedite the administration of these courts, a modern audio and visual recording system will be installed. (Rs. 25 Mn)
234. We will also introduce an automated case management mechanism. (Rs. 50 Mn)
235. The court complexes in Ratnapura and Welimada have been identified to be susceptible to landslides and as such we will support the relocation of these two court complexes. (Rs. 500 Mn)
236. The Kilinochchi, Theldeniya, Pugoda and Kantale court complexes will be relocated and expanded to address the congestion and lack of facilities at these complexes. (Rs. 400 Mn)
237. Juvenile offenders and victims often are transported to the court houses together with the adult offenders creating many issues for the minors. As such, we will support the procurement of vehicles dedicated to transport such juvenile offenders and victims. (Rs. 50 Mn)
STRENGTHENING THE CAPITAL MARKETS
238. Our capital markets remain largely untapped. As such, we will ensure that the necessary legal framework and the policy environment are created for its further development. In this regard, we will divest our holdings in non-strategic enterprises which I believe will create buoyancy in our stock markets. Our capital market strategy is propelled by a desire to ensure access the long term funding at a lower cost to fuel growth ventures.
239. We have already commenced the implementation of the Basel III requirements for our banking sector where the targets are to be met by 2019. However, out of the 6 banks designated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to be Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs), 3 State banks, i.e.,the Bank of Ceylon (BoC), Peoples Bank (PB) and the National Savings Bank (NSB), are facing capital pressures. Both BoC and NSB have accessed the international capital markets, successfully on the strength of their own balance sheets signifying that our State banks are now mature enough to raise their own capital from the markets. It is in this context that we will allow the BoC and the PB to raise both debt and equity capital. In raising equity capital, the State will not relinquish the controlling ownership, but is willing to allow the divestitures, provided that the depositors and the employees are given the option of becoming shareholders. However, in the interim, we will infuse Rs. 5 billion as equity to BoC in 2017 and a further Rs. 5 billion in 2018. We will also infuse Rs. 2.5 billion as capital into the Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bank in 2017. (Rs. 5,000 Mn)
HERITAGE AND CULTURE
240. Mr Speaker, we are the proud heirs of a rich and vibrant heritage. It is the one that we must protect, so that, our generations to come will also be able to experience its richness. Our Government is keen to ensure that our religious places and archeological sites are properly protected and conserved. We are also keen to ensure that our arts and artisans are also protected. As such, I propose the following:
241. We will establish a Buddhist Library under the auspices of the Public Library. (Rs. 50 Mn)
242. We will support the restoration and renovation activities of our Purana Viharas of archeological value, all over the country, as well as other such places of worship of Hindu, Christian and Islamic faith. (Rs. 250 Mn)

244. The conservation and the preservation of the Ritigala and Rajagalatenna archeological sites will be continued. (Rs. 25 Mn)
245. The Racecourse building will be converted into the National Center for Arts, Crafts and Modern Design. This will be a hub for both traditional and contemporary artists, artisans and, designers to not only exhibit their craft but also to link to the market. Funding will also be available to artists and designers to showcase their talent and, products both here and abroad. (Rs. 250 Mn)
246. Theres a serious need for recreational facilities, especially in towns with a growing middle to upper middle income population. We will encourage the development of contemporary arts through the establishment of world class performance Centre in Moratuwa. (Rs. 600 Mn)
247. We will restore the Cultural Hall in Thaalvupadu, Mannar. (Rs. 25 Mn)
248. The accident and medical insurance scheme for artists supported by the Presidents Welfare Fund and the Tower Hall Foundation will be introduced. (Rs. 10 Mn)
PUBLIC SECTOR
249. Mr Speaker, our public sector, like many around the world, is under increasing pressure to perform and reform. Our bureaucratic structures have remained unchallenged and unchecked for years, thus, becoming a hindrance in efficient and effective service delivery. The dire need to ensure competitiveness, surely, must be the catalyst to stimulate the reform process. Infusion of technology and, change of laws and regulations are a must. Most importantly, empowerment of the public servant is essential. It is in this context, I propose the following:
250. The ICTA has been entrusted with the task of leading the Governments effort of improving service delivery through digitization of Government systems and Rs. 2,000 Mn procedures and, the infusion of technology. For this purpose, we will allocate Rs. 2,000 million for their on-going initiatives and operational expenditures.
251. The National Economic Council to ensure a more coordinated approach in formulating the countrys development policies. Rs. 300 Mn
252. The Integrated Treasury Management Information System (ITMIS), connecting all the departments in the General Treasury, has just been launched. The ITMIS will facilitate better Treasury management and we will support its roll-out which includes capacity building, infrastructure development, especially of the spending units in the periphery etc. A new Chart of Accounts will also be implemented under the ITMIS. (Rs. 500 Mn)
253. We will also introduce a common payroll system for public sector employees.
254. We will shift into accrual accounting in preparing the financial statements, from the existing modified cash accounting methodology within the next 10 years. This will improve the countrys balance sheet ensuring better accountability and transparency.
255. We will strengthen the capacities of the Local Government bodies with further investments. (Rs. 150 Mn)
256. We will also introduce a National Evaluation Policy and Evaluation System for the country, ensuring transparency, accountability, and evidence-based decision making.
257. The Salaries and Cadre Commission is requested to undertake a comprehensive study on the salary anomalies in the public sector.
258. The Government will initiate a programme of providing child care facilities in Government offices that have more than 500 employees or at least 500 employees, collectively in a few offices in the same vicinity together with the private sector. (The Government will procure such facilities from the private sector). (Rs. 50 Mn)
259. At present the Agrahara Insurance is applicable to retirees who have retired after 2016 for a lifetime. This will now be extended to all retirees for the entire lifetime, with a contributory premium. (Rs. 50 Mn)
260. Tax concessions applicable on the public servants concessionary vehicle scheme will be continued, with a Rupee value based upper ceiling.
261. Fees charged for the services provided by Government agencies have not been revised for many years. These must be revised periodically to reflect the present economic indicators. Thus, I propose to increase such fees which have not been revised during last 3 years, by 15%.
RECONCILIATION
262. Mr Speaker, if Sri Lanka is to achieve its goal of becoming an advanced economy, it is essential that we build our future plans on a strong foundation of democracy and reconciliation. We must ensure that the tragedies of the past we had to face as a nation, does not ever recur again. Reconciliation and national unity, based on the diversity of our island, is a must, if we are to achieve our vision 2025 and become a country enriched. Therefore, the Government will continue their efforts with greater vigor and commitment to bring the people of all communities of our country together. Despite winning the war, we have yet to win the peace and in order to do so, it is essential that we win the hearts of those in the war affected areas. Their livelihoods must be improved and the benefits of economic development must reach them.
263. On an initiative of the President, 50,000 brick and mortar type houses will be constructed in the North and the East. This is in addition to the allocations already provided to other Ministries.
(Rs. 750 Mn)
264. The Government will support programs and activities in rural irrigation development including drip irrigation, rain water harvesting, and integrated village development. (Rs. 2,000 Mn)
265. We will strengthen reconciliation focused livelihood development, economic empowerment and social infrastructure development. This will also include the construction of a special home for differently abled women in the North. (Rs. 2,750 Mn)
266. Indebtedness in the rural sector targeted by exploitative microfinance schemes have become a serious issue. The small industries in the Northern Province have also not been able to revive due to both the lack of working capital and equity. As such, I propose the following:
267. The Government will support by way of provision of grants and the introduction of a low interest loan scheme to facilitate those indebted and to move out the debt trap through Co-operative Rural Banks and the Thrift and Credit Co-operative
Societies. This will be implemented on a pilot basis in the North and the North Central Provinces. Rs. 1,000 Mn
268. Existing small industries will be facilitated to increase production and to connect with the markets through existing subsidized credit schemes under the Enterprise Sri Lanka Credit Schemes.
269. The Government will support, by way of grants, selected small industries

(Rs. 1,000 Mn)
270. We will also establish 2 food processing centers in Delft Island and Kilinnochchi, specializing in Sap based produce such as Palm Juggery, Palmyra fruits and Tuber processing, respectively. (Rs. 40 Mn)
271. The Mylitty harbor will be developed as a fishery harbor enabling mainly, the traditional dwellers of the land, affected by the war to get back to their traditional livelihoods. We will also establish cool rooms and storage facilities to enable the fisherman to store their fish. This facility will be established by the Government. (Rs. 150 Mn)
272. Only about 50% of the Achchuveli Industrial Zone is utilized, at present. I propose to bear 50% of the electricity cost of the companies that will be established, for a period of 2 years and to upgrade the facilities at Achchuveli. (Rs. 100 Mn)
273. We will establish a modern economic center in Jaffna connected to the Dambulla dedicated Economic Center and to Colombo, creating an economic triangle. (Rs. 100 Mn)

277. We commend the Ammachchi concept where women affected by the war are facilitated to engage in small trader businesses and will further support this venture. (Rs. 25 Mn)
278. It is also essential that the 12,600 rehabilitated ex-combatants are provided with a stable livelihood. However, many of these persons do not have any formal qualifications despite possessing many skills. We will make them eligible for employment by facilitating them to obtain NVQ certification in keeping with their skills. This will be implemented through a mobile service. This will also be made available to those in the North and the East, whose education was disrupted during the war. (Rs. 25 Mn)
279. As such, private entities that recruit at least 5 ex- combatants will be provided with a salary subsidy of 50% of the salary per person subject to an upper limit of Rs. 10,000 per person per month for period of 12 months. (Rs. 250 Mn)

282. The term of the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms (SCRM) has been extended and as such, we will support its activities.
(Rs. 180 M)
COST OF LIVING SUPPORT
283. The adverse weather conditions have resulted in a significant contraction in the agriculture produce this year, in particular, rice and coconut production. This has resulted in a severe impact on the basic food prices. We have taken several measures recently, to reduce the cost of living impact, including the measures taken yesterday to reduce the import taxes on B-Onions, Potatoes, Lentils, Dried Fish, Sprats and Edible oils.
284. We will strengthen this measure further, by supporting the creation of fair price shops through established retailers in public spaces provided by the Government, free of charge. The operators will commit to offer-for-sale consumer items below the market price for the benefit of the consumer.
285. The Consumer Affairs Authority will be strengthened to protect the consumer from price and quality manipulators
SPECIAL LEVY FOR DEBT REPAYMENT
286. Mr Speaker, the next 3 years will be crucial with debt repayments amounting to almost Rs. 7,000 billion. This includes the repayment of international sovereign bonds which will mature every year amounting to almost Rs. 600 billion where bunching is a severe strain on the Government finances. In 2018 alone, the debt repayment amounts to Rs. 1970 billion. As was the case in the last 2 years, you would have noticed that we have not compromised on the investments to be made in 2018 in spite of the impending debt burden. However, we do need support. As such, I propose to charge a Special Levy for Debt Repayment at the rate of 20 cents per Rs. 1,000 on the total transaction made through banks with effect from 1st April 2018. This will be applicable only for 3 years and shall not be passed on to the customers.

289. Documentation processes required for imports will also be automated from 1st January 2018.
290. Smuggled Cigarettes have flooded into the local market creating major source of revenue leakage. As part of our strategy to address this matter, we will issue licenses to import Cigarettes and Cigars while clamping down heavily on smuggling.
291. The Usance LC facility will also not be permitted to be used for the importation of motor vehicles from 1st January 2018.
INLAND REVENUE
292. The RAMIS will be appropriately changed to facilitate the implementation of the IRD Act. (Rs. 500 Mn)
EXCISE
293. The Excise Ordinance of 1912 needs to be revamped to suit the present day requirements. Given the use of information technology is minimal at the Department; an Excise Revenue Management System (ERSL) will be introduced.
(Rs. 50 Mn)
294. In order to monitor the production of liquor, and assisting in curtailing of illegal liquor production, an excise duty will be imposed on raw materials used for Ethanol production based on the quantity. I also propose to introduce an excise duty of Rs. 15 per litre on non-potable alcohol. Both these will be implemented from mid-night today.
295. Mr. Speaker, during past two years, the Government implemented various fiscal policy measures of broadening the tax base and minimizing the tax expenditure. Committing to these policies, the VAT and the NBT exemptions will be further rationalized. Necessary changes will be made in ESC, Stamp Duty and other tax legislations with the view of to strengthening the tax administration. (The changes proposed are in the Technical note).
SMS ADVERTISING LEVY

299. Mr Speaker, I wish to thank the President and the Prime Minister for the guidance given. I wish to thank my State Minister, Hon. Eran Wickramaratne and the Deputy Minister, Hon. Lasantha Alagiyawanna for their support. I also extend my gratitude to all those who sent in their proposals which guided this Budget. I am grateful to my colleagues at the Cabinet and all members of Parliament on both sides of the isle for the support extended. Last but not least, I wish to thank the Secretary to the Treasury and all the officials who worked hard in preparing this Budget.
300. In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I want to say that at the heart of the ensuing debate in the coming 26 days will lie, not only the question of Economic Development, but also the question of values. We will talk about values that should shape our country and determine our childrens future. On one side of the debate indivisibility of our great nation, rights and dignity for all, rule of law, strong institutions, economic prosperity built on strong foundation of democracy and reconciliation. Some others, on the other hand, will speak about values based on fear, suspicion, mistrust, bigotry and intolerance.
301. Yes Mr. Speaker, we are at the crossroads of history. Are we to walk forward, united in our diversity to a new age of freedom and prosperity or are we to go back to the darkness of a bygone era  The choice is ours to make.

DEFIANT BUDGET to steer Lanka to prosperity
Minister of Finance and Mass Media, Mangala Samaraweera, presented the Budget proposals for 2018 (Second reading of the Appropriation Bill) with the theme, Blue Green Budget.
The government in its Budget proposals 2018 expects a budget deficit of 4.5% and envisages it to drop to 3.5% of the GDP by 2020.
It was proposed that Rs 10,000 million be allocated for establishing an EXIM Bank to provide long-term loans for Small and Medium scale businesses. Women too will receive an interest concession of more than 10% under the Enterprise Sri Lanka loan scheme.
It was also proposed to allocate Rs 800 million for the Export Market Access Program which will be introduced for companies with less than 10 million dollars in earnings.
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera presenting the 2018 budget in Parliament yesterday said, Sri Lanka to help repay debt will charge a tax on banking transactions known as the Medamulana Tax at the rate of 20 cents for every 1,000 rupees.
The tax will be applicable for 3 years and will come into effect from April 01, 2018.
According to the Minister, financial institution will have to pay the proposed tax and it will be charged on all cash transactions.
The business community and the Chambers hailed most of the proposals with most of them harping on the point that they should be implemented and not remain as proposals until the next budget. Most of the proposals in the previous budget are yet to be implemented and we hope this would not be repeated in 2018 as well, they said.
They also said Ministers too should utilize the budgetary allocations that were allocated to them.
Tax consultant and Council Member Chamber of International Trade Information Services H. I. P. Imaduwa said that the budget has widened the tax base and could be considered a friendlier budget.
When you compare with previous budgets this budget has moved to reduce tax incentives and tax holidays. New mythology (new technology) has been used for collection of revenue.
The incentives granted to Export Development companies too are very pleasing. The Budget has looked at the younger generation, particularly their desire for employment opportunities and also facilitated the needs of those seeking foreign education. It has also focused on promoting several eco-friendly environmental measures.
Kelani Cables Plc, Director and CEO Mahinda Saranapala commenting on governments decision to allocate Rs 800 million for export market support noted that this key initiative would improve the environment for local businesses and investment, thereby enabling exporters to sell more volumes in the international market.
According to Saranapala, proposals to empower women entrepreneurs and to promote start- up culture in Sri Lanka would eventually create more jobs and boost economic growth in the country.
The motor industry was anticipating many changes in the budget for both buyers and sellers and as expected the electric car segment saw major price slashes on electric vehicles that will reduce a vehicle by around Rs one million. The Budget proposals on vehicles include special levies on luxury vehicles with engine capacity of more than 2500cc. The levy on electric vehicles will decrease by Rs10 laks and a levy on luxury vehicles will increase by Rs. 25 lakhs.
Similarly the levy for fuel vehicles will be reformed and import taxes for electrical vehicles be reduced. All government vehicles will be converted to electrical or hybrid by 2025. The government also aims to ensure that all vehicles in the country by 2040 will be environmentally friendly. Electric three wheelers will have a 90% concession from the government, while a ban will be imposed on vehicles which do not have airbags and also a carbon tax will be introduced which are very much welcomed moves.
Meanwhile the budget proposals on motor industry has failed to understand core issues says the Ceylon Motor Traders Association (CMTA). CMTA President Reeza Rauf said the budget proposals on the motor industry have failed to understand the present core issue of the ailing auto industry.
We dont see any significant changers that were proposed by CMTA for a level playing field in the budget proposals 2018. More focus is emphasized on electric vehicles which at present does not solve the industry woes as electric vehicles are available only with a couple of manufactures. This creates an opening for more unscrupulous imports, the CMTA President alleged.
Rauf said it was good to have a vision to have all electric vehicles by 2040 as proposed, but in reality the people need to exist for the day and need to come with realistic taxation policies for the survival of the Industry which was not found in it. The Industries contribution towards large number of employment and revenue to the Government is overlooked, Rauf alleged.
As claimed the revenue leakage is due to grey imports which is being manipulated by used car imports and not by brand new vehicles imported by franchise holders, Riza emphasized
The unit rate taxation will fail to control the homologation of vehicles coming in to the country and pave the way for all type of vehicles to arrive which can lead to serious after sales and spare parts issues. Further this wont be able to control the outflow of foreign exchange and can lead to under invoicing, the CMTA President alleged.
Sanjee Balasuriya, Managing Director and CEO of eCybersec Pvt Ltd commenting on budget proposal of investing Rs 3 billion in the next few years for local start ups and to bring in new start ups, said that this key initiative by the government towards a digital economy with a new fund will be conducive to developing a more vibrant IT innovation and technology ecosystem in Sri Lankan Start ups. At the same time, Sri Lanka will produce innovative entrepreneurships with this government key initiative and by bringing more value together with the foreign start ups, the economy will boost with a high pinnacle which will lead to a most advanced digital hub in Asia.
Meanwhile, Nalin Silva, President, Institute of Supply and Material (ISMM) said the budget proposal to amend the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act and Merchant Shipping Act to suit current times is a step taken in the right direction.
This will further strengthen supply chain activities in the country and achieving the hub status goal.
Coral Holdings, Chairman Dr. Piraba Subramaniam, the first international property developer, building Maldives largest condominium project said the budget proposal to relax the regulations enabling foreigners to buy apartments of four floors, will further boost the construction sector.
I must also say that with our experience of 14 years in the industry there is no property bubble and the industry is strong. We too are investing Rs 4 billion on four new projects and with this new budget proposal we expect more foreign buyers as well.
Shiran Fernando, Chairman, TESS Group of Companies said that the Government has focused on fisheries sector and they are happy about the positive vision for the 2018 Budget proposals for this segment.
We import a lot of canned fish in to the country and the current budget proposal has decided to give the opportunity for the Lankan manufacturers which in turn would result in lower exports. We think that we can now reap even better benefits of lifting of the EU fisheries ban with these incentives. We can now look for a better future for the fisheries sector.
Chatham Luxury Watches CEO Indrajith Ranawana said that the proposal on VAT refund scheme to be implemented on foreign passport holders from May 1, 2018 will help Sri Lankas objective of being a major shopping destination. It would entice both foreigners and expatriates working in Sri Lanka to do more purchases from Sri Lanka which in turn would help to boost their sales.
An international businessman, CEO, Shan Halamba, Riococo Lanka (Pvt) Ltd - Sri Lanka and Ceyhinz Link International, Inc  USA, he said that the first budget presented by Minister Samaraweera has been given number of opportunities to young people to stand alone as future successful Entrepreneurs. They should grab this golden opportunity and be creative as well as self-motivated to become self-employed Entrepreneurs and support the Economy of Sri Lanka.
Today my business after 17 years of hard work and sacrifices, I now export Coir based (growing media) products to 47 countries and I did not get these kind of proposed benefits.
The Chambers say
Ramal Jasinghe, President National Chamber of Exporets (NCE) said they welcome these gestures that would hopefully galvanize businesses, particularly the manufacturing and agricultural sectors to develop and focus on export based production and innovation.
We are keen that the necessary infrastructure would be developed to facilitate easy access to the Rs. 800 million for the proposed Export Market Access program to realize any gains from this measure.
The immediate past Chairman of the Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI), Tissa Seneviratne said that their main effort and expectation is to safeguard and develop the industrial sector in the country.
In a press release issued on the 2018 National Budget, Seneviratne highlighted that the new budget shows certain positive signs that offer relief to the common life in the country. Price reduction of essential commodities, concessions and subsidiaries granted to the agricultural sector, insurance systems introduced to cover their growing fields are good measures to improve the living standards of the majority of the masses who depend on agriculture.
However, as the industrial chamber in the country, our main effort and expectation is to safeguard and uplift the standards of the industrial sector in the country which contributes to the GDP in a great way and generate employment.
He said that the Government has strived to extend measures to develop local industries and the CNCI do appreciates relief given to the SME sector. Chamber CNCI expects measures of protection from dumping and under invoicing, waste disposal in the absence of sufficient incinerating facilities, inability to submit internationally accepted quality certifications, which has become a great non-tariff barrier.
CNCI expects the anti-dumping legislation be enforced shortly which has been proposed in the past years budgets too.
Also the local industry expects a conducive environment for their businesses to be strong in a manner that they can compete in the international market.
Meanwhile Sujeeve Samaraweera, the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka said that the introduction of the new concept to encourage the Business Environment by the name of Enterprise Sri Lanka would be a positive step taken by the government towards business development.
Under this programme the government is proposing the development of Woman Entrepreneurship, SME Development and Agri and Plantation sector development etc. Additionally the government is proposing to introduce a Development Bank to support the financial needs of the SME Sector.
The encouragement provided for deep sea fishing and infra structure facilities for Fisheries Sector are also appreciated, he said.
The development proposals focusing on Tourism Sector will also help the economy to be expanded. The Information Technology Sector has been given greater attention with the intention of increasing Forex earnings to US 5 billion in the next years to come. Further the government is proposing to develop the capital market by introducing many reforms with a special focus on the State banking sector.
The proposals to develop the Road Infrastructure in the country will also have a positive impact on the economy and also the positive proposals put forward by the government on managing the solid waste in the country and reduction of taxes on all electric vehicles is commendable.
The National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka plans to release a much more detailed analysis on Monday.

Emirates welcomes 100th A380 to its fleet
Emirates has celebrated the milestone delivery of its 100thAirbus A380 aircraft at a special ceremony with Airbus at the manufacturers delivery centre in Hamburg.
Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum, Emirates Chairman and Chief Executive officiated the ceremony. He was joined at the event by Sir Tim Clark, President Emirates Airline; Tom Enders, Airbus Chief Executive Officer; Dominic Horwood, Rolls-Royce, Director - Customer and Services; Ali Al Ahmed, UAE Ambassador to Germany and Frank Horch, Senator for Economy, Transport and Innovation of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg.
Sheikh Ahmed said, This is a tremendous moment for Emirates, for Airbus and for our many partners involved in the A380 programme. There is no doubt that the A380 has had a big positive impact on aerospace manufacturing and the broader aviation industry, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs and stimulating innovation and new product development in many related areas such as ground handling, catering, airport facilities and cabin products, to name a few.
Importantly, the A380 also brought the flying experience for our customers to the next level. The aircraft itself is a showpiece of engineering. It is the worlds largest commercial passenger jet but it is quiet and efficient and at Emirates weve utilised the onboard real estate to redefine the thinking around inflight products and experience. Our flight crew love to fly it and our customers love to fly in it.
For Emirates, the A380 has been a success. Weve been able to utilise it at slot-constrained airports, as well as at regional and secondary airports where we have grown passenger demand. Each time we deploy an A380 onto a route, it typically stimulates further traffic and demand as travellers are attracted by our flagship A380 experience. "We remain committed to the programme and will work closely with Airbus and our partners to continually enhance our A380 product as we look ahead to receiving our remaining 42 aircraft on order.
Adding to the celebrations, Emirates unveiled a special tribute to the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, founding father of the United Arab Emirates, with bespoke livery for its 100thA380.

Europes first underwater restaurant
Europe is home to the Greek Parthenon in Athens, the Roman Colosseum in Rome, the Eiffel Tower in Paris and many, many more architectural masterpieces. You know what its lacking, though An underwater restaurant. But a company called Snhetta (previously here) is on a quest to change that. They have designed a three-level structure with a 36-foot-wide panoramic window that allows visitors to journey to the sea in southern Norway.
At first glance, Under looks like a concrete container, tossed into the shallows near the village Bly, but once inside it radiates life. The restaurant will have the space to fit up to 100 guests, and the building will even double as a marine research centre when no one is dining.
More than an aquarium, the structure will become a part of its marine environment, coming to rest directly on the sea bed five meters below the waters surface, Snhetta writes. Like a sunken periscope, the restaurants massive acrylic windows offer a view of the seabed as it changes throughout the seasons and varying weather conditions.

## Title: An expeditious interim relief in Commercial  Arbitration
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Finance
## Date: Friday, November 10, 2017 - 01:00
An expeditious interim relief in Commercial  Arbitration
The concept of Emergency Order (EO) is becoming increasingly popular in the realm of international commercial arbitration. It is an expeditious non-judicial interim relief which could prevent imminent risks before forming the arbitral tribunal which sometimes takes longer. Although there are certain methods available to speed up the formation of arbitration tribunals, they are not sufficient in urgent matters; and tribunals have no powers to issue any provisional measures before they are formed.
To avoid any irreparable damages likely to be caused and to preserve the goods and evidence before the formation of the arbitration tribunal. An Emergency Arbitrator could be appointed and thereafter an EO could be claimed. According to ICC Arbitration Rules, a party who needs urgent interim or conservatory measures before the constitution of an arbitral tribunal, has a right to make an application under the Emergency Arbitrator Rules (Art. 29 (1) and Appendix V).
The CIETAC Arbitration Rules mention that a party could appoint an Emergency Arbitrator (Art. 23 and Appendix 3). The LCIA Arbitration Rules mentions that it is possible to appoint an Emergency Arbitrator in special circumstances mentioned under it (Art. 9 B). Arbitration Rules like ACICA, ICDR, SCC, HKIAC, NAI, PRIME and Swiss Rules have introduced provisions allowing parties to appoint an Emergency Arbitrator and to claim EO.
The benefits accruable from EO
There are many success stories where an EO has been effectively utilized by parties. For instance, in Yahoo! Inc. Vs. Microsoft Corporation 2013, Microsoft Corporation has successfully used Emergency Measures against Yahoo Inc. in terms of a contractual dispute between them by following the procedure of the American Arbitration Association. This Emergency Arbitrators Order has been upheld by the domestic Court.
Although arbitral tribunals could issue Interim Reliefs and Preliminary Orders, both are possible only after the tribunal is constituted. Hence, Emergency Order is useful for an aggrieved party to prevent the other one from avoiding the effective compliance of final Award.
Even though parties have not expressly consented, to the Emergency Measures, such measures imply to the arbitration procedure through the agreed arbitral rules unless expressly opted out. On the other hand, since the EO does not bind the arbitral tribunal, it does not become an obstacle for the dispute resolution mechanism.
Therefore, Emergency Orders, do not avoid the freedom of the tribunal to further investigate anything related to the emergency and issue any subsequent Orders to modify or completely terminate the measures which have been taken. Since Emergency Arbitrator has a wider authority to issue Orders, during that period, the party which is in danger, necessarily has a substantial possibility to receive benefits out of it.
Another advantage of Emergency Measures is the flexibility to be opted out by parties agreement. Thus, it is not against the consensual nature of arbitration and the autonomy of the parties. Since EO has not provided any bar to prevent domestic Court to investigate the matter, parties still have alternative measures which could be selected based on their discretion.
Further, there are protections within Emergency Measures to avoid the abuse of it. For instance, in ICC Rules of Arbitration, there is a condition that the requesting party must furnish a security when applying (Art. 29 (1)). Additionally, if the defending party is genuinely disposing his assets, such disposal may not be unreasonably delayed because emergency proceedings would be terminated if the applicant was unable to file arbitration request within 10 days (Appendix V. Art 1(6)).

Whats wrong with interim measures and preliminary orders
Interim Measure is a temporary measure which could be issued by the arbitral tribunal at any time before the issuance of the final Award. The Arbitration Act No.11 of 1995 of Sri Lanka states that, an arbitral tribunal may, at the request of a party, order any other party to take Interim Measures as it may consider necessary to protect or secure the claim which forms the subject matter of the dispute (S.13 (1)). But, other than in exceptional cases no such order should be made except after hearing the other parties.
The UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration indicates that once a party has made a request, arbitral tribunal has powers to grant interim reliefs mentioned in Article 17.The same has been incorporated in the Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The Model Law indicates that interim measures could preserve the assets and evidence relating to the subject matter of the dispute (Art. 17 (2) (c)& (d)). For instance, if goods were not in perishable nature, then tribunal could order to deposit them with a third party, otherwise it could order to sell them.
Furthermore, parties are required to satisfy certain conditions to obtain an Interim Order. First, the claimant should prove that the potential harm is irreparable by an Award of damages and the possibility of being successful on the merit of the claim (Arts.17 A (1) (a) & (b)). In addition, there are certain safeguards to avoid the misusing of the Interim Measures.
For instance, arbitral tribunals have capacities to amend, suspend or cancel the Interim Order in any situation (Art. 17 D). Tribunal could also order parties to provide security (Art. 17 E). Additionally, Model Law mentions that requesting party would be liable for cost or damages (Art. 17 G).
Many arbitral rules have followed mainly three approaches regarding the Interim Measures. First approach is following the Model law and the inclusion of a general description about Interim Measures. Second approach is the inclusion of a detail description about such measures. The third approach is non-inclusion of any Interim Measures at all in the arbitration rules. For instance, JCCA Rules have followed the first approach and provided a general description about the Interim Measures (R. 48 (1)).
SIAC and ACICA Rules have followed the second approach and introduced more extended versions of Interim Measures. Following the UNCITRAL Model Law, certain arbitration rules have provided opportunity to obtain ex parte Interim Measures. For instance, Article 26 (3) of the Swiss Arbitration Rules states that the interim proceedings could be commenced on ex parte basis. This provision has been made to speed up the processing of urgent claims.
Preliminary Orders are controversial because they could be issued on ex parte basis. According to Model Law, party may, without notice to any other party, make a request for an Interim Measure together with an application for a Preliminary Order(Art. 17 B (1)). This may not be unreasonable because domestic Courts also sometimes issue exparte Orders.
However, an argument could be advanced that issuing an ex parte Order is against the concept of consensual nature of commercial arbitration. Many arbitration rules have not introduced ex parte Orders except in the Swiss Rules.
Why should an injunction order not be preferred
There are certain restrictions upon injunctive reliefs in respect of commercial matters where parties have agreed to arbitrate. According to Arbitration Act No.11 of 1995 of Sri Lanka Any dispute which the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration under an arbitration agreement may be determined by arbitration unless the matter in respect of which the arbitration agreement is entered into is contrary to public policy or, is not capable of determination by arbitration (S. 4).
If a party did not submit the dispute to arbitration as agreed and instead filed Action in the Court, then Section 5 of the said Act would be applied. Accordingly, where a party to an arbitration agreement institutes legal proceedings in a court against another party to such agreement in respect of a matter agreed to be submitted for arbitration under such agreement, the Court shall have no jurisdiction to hear and determine such matter if the other party objects to the court exercising jurisdiction in respect of such matter (S. 5).
In Munasinghege Don Eranga Indrajith Vs. George Steuart Finance Limited 2014, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Commercial High Court dismissing Plaintiffs Action seeking inter alia, an enjoining order and an interim injunction, because there was an Arbitration clause and the Defendant has objected to the Court exercising jurisdiction.
It was held in Elgitread Lanka (Pvt) Ltd Vs.Bino Tyres (Pvt) Ltd 2010, that the Action filed by the Respondent in the Commercial High Court should stand dismissed as there was an arbitration clause in the franchise agreement and the Appellant objected to the jurisdiction of the Commercial High Court on that basis.
Further, the modern view of arbitration expects a certain level of delocalization, which means exclude the intervention of Court up to certain extent. That is why the remedy of EO has been introduced within the Arbitration Rules, rather than within the domestic law. In Channel Tunnel Group Ltd Vs. Balfour Beatty Constr. Ltd 1993, Court held that the judicial authority must be very careful in issuing Interim Measures regarding arbitration disputes.
Could EO be enforced under NYC
Compared with enforcement of arbitration Awards, there is an issue regarding the enforceability of Emergency Order under the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (NYC) because only Awards are enforceable under that (Art. 3). For instance, the domestic Courts have discretion to refuse enforcing any Interim Orders issued by arbitral tribunals because they are not binding as final Awards (Art. 5 (1) (e)).
According to Article 29 of the ICC Rules, EO is an Order, but not an Award; and it does not limit or bind the tribunals capacity to further investigate the dispute. However, in CIETAC Arbitration Rules, Emergency Arbitrators decision could be either an Order or an Award (Art. 23 (2)). The ICDR Arbitration Rules state that an Order or an Award could be made by the Emergency Arbitrator (Art. 37 (5)). Both Swiss and the SCC Rules have used the term decision to represent the outcome of emergency proceedings (Art. 43 (7); Art 9 (1)).
Nevertheless, when considering the situation, of Interim Measures, before 2006 UNCITRAL Model Law (Model Law) revision, even the Interim Measures were unenforceable in certain situations. For instance, in Resort Condominiums International Inc. Vs. Ray Bolwell and Anor. 1993, it was held that the Court has the discretion whether to enforce an arbitral Award or not which has been rendered by a foreign arbitral tribunal.
This issue has been sorted after the Model Law 2006 revision. At present, an Interim Measure is binding and enforceable in any state (Art. 17 H (1)). Enforceability could be refused only in special circumstances given in Article 17 I. Certain jurisdictions have recognized EOs as Awards.
For instance, in Singapore the term Emergency Arbitrator has been included in to the definition of Arbitral Tribunal. They further included the term Order under the definition of Arbitration Award. This means EOs could be sometimes considered Awards in Singapore. Consequently, it could be enforced under NYC.
Moreover, parties must comply with any EO and it has a binding nature. In Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Vs. Medimpact Healthcare Systems Inc. 2010, Court held that an EO is important in terms of enforcing the contract between the parties. According to ICC Rules, the arbitral tribunal has legal capacity to decide upon any partys requests or claims relating to the emergency arbitrator proceedings, including the claims and costs regarding the compliance or non-compliance of an EO (Art. 29 (4)).
Constraints upon EO
The power vested in the Emergency Arbitrator is not absolute because of two reasons. First, EO could be obtained only if there is a genuine urgency. Secondly, once the tribunal is appointed, emergency proceedings would become terminated (SIAC Arbitration Rules, Sch.1). Issuing an EO without considering whether the sale is mala fidei or bona fidei, could create adverse consequences in a genuine sale.
There are certain limits in the process of issuing an EO. First, emergency arbitrator has no power to issue an Interim order against third parties. For instance, Emergency Arbitrator lacks the legal capacity to order a bank to seize an account or withhold transactions. In contrast, the domestic Court has much wider legal capacity to seize such bank accounts. Secondly, Emergency Arbitrator cannot impose any criminal penalties in case of disobeying his Orders whereas domestic Courts are stricter by considering it as contempt of Court and impose strict criminal charges.
Thirdly, unlike ordinary arbitration procedure, in Emergency Arbitration, parties choice to select their own arbitrator is limited because many arbitration rules have reserved the selection power to the institution rather than to parties. Since, there are such limitations, parties may in certain situations tend to seek interim reliefs from domestic Courts instead of seeking an EO.
A best practice Case-Based approach
Since intervention of domestic Court is not widely accepted in conventional arbitration, the best practice would be the Case-based decision making. Which means, parties should plan and assess the outcome of an Emergency Order before claiming for it.
For instance, if the arbitration tribunal is likely to be formed soon and the risk is not substantially imminent, it would be better to wait until the formation of such tribunal rather than rushing towards seeking an EO. In addition, where possible, parties could take a reasonable effort to exhaust methods such as expedited formation of tribunal or appointing a sole arbitrator, in less urgent circumstances.
Based on the urgency of the matter, two approaches have been followed by the rules regarding the time which allow the parties to bring an emergency claim. First approach is, allowing parties to bring such claim after the Notice of Arbitration but before the formation of the tribunal. For instance, ICDR Rules have mentioned, it could be claimed after the Notice but before forming the tribunal (Art. 37(2)).
The second approach is, allowing parties to bring emergency claims even before the Arbitration Notice. For instance, in view of the ICC Rules, irrespective of arbitration request, Emergency Measures could be claimed (Art. 29 (1)). This means, the ICC Rules are substantially flexible in terms of the time of application of Emergency Measures. However, certain arbitration rules have provided slightly strict conditions on the timing issue of the EO claim. For instance, Swiss Rules have mentioned that if the emergency application has been filed before the Arbitration Notice, then Court has a discretion to refuse such claim (Art. 43 (3)).
Future reforms
Arbitration Centres and Institutes could introduce Emergency Measures within their Rules& Procedures. The Legislation and Institutional Rules could be reformed to convey authority to Emergency Arbitrators to seize respondents assets which withheld by third parties.
At least there should be provisions to do such seizures with the cooperation of domestic Court without any delay. Such provisions would increase the validity and recognition of Emergency Orders. UNCITRAL Model Law and the Arbitral Rules could be reformed by including provisions empowering the international enforceability of Emergency Orders in commercial arbitration.

Fanam International  wins Bronze  at NCE  Exports Excellence Award
Fanam International (Pvt) Ltd, a leading company in the Sri Lankan organic compost fertilizers exports trade, was honored with the Bronze Award in Fisheries and Livestock of the Agriculture Value Added Sector at the NCE Exports Excellence 2017 award ceremony organized by the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka recently.
The Director of Fanam International (Pvt) Ltd, T.F.N. Amith said that this victory of his company has been the result of a collective effort by all the employees.
Fanam International (Pvt) Ltd saw its inception in 1986 and has been placed at No.1 position among the companies that export organic compost fertilizers for the past few years. Marking it in the history, Fanam International (Pvt) Ltd could execute the first Sri Lankan export transaction of livestock to the Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture in Maldives in response to their request in 2015.
Accordingly, they exported six goats to Maldives for the first time in 2015. 10 goats were sent to Maldives respectively in 2016. They are prepared to dispatch 20 more goats to their livestock farmers before the end of 2017.
It is noticeable that these goats were sent for the purpose of breeding.
This can be highlighted as a drive opening new avenues for Sri Lanka to gain foreign exchange for livestock sector. Though Maldives Ministry was importing goats from India till 2015, they started importing Goats from Sri Lanka due to the fact that quarantine measures and test protocols are superior in the region.
They also import goat milk and cow milk to Maldives and they intend to produce fresh goat milk from these goats. Fanam International (Pvt) Ltd is also planning to export cows to Maldives in order to originate capacity for them to initiate and strengthen their diary sector.
The company is also active in Poultry exports having made several shipments of one day old layer chicks and country farm chicks to its Ministry and Farmers. In addition to the above trades, Fanam also exports live plants for floriculture and Horticulture sector and to many Resorts in Maldives.

Foreigners on residence visa to be charged for health services
Health Ministry has proposed the Government to charge at least USD 50 from all foreign nationals who visit Sri Lanka on working / residence visa. The charge is for the health services provided for them, Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J. M. W. Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a health seminar held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday he said that under the current law no foreign national is eligible to receive free health services offered by the Sri Lankan Government for all Sri Lankan citizens.
Only Sri Lankan citizens are eligible to receive the free health service.According to Dr. Bandara, at the moment around 60,000 foreign nationals arrive in Sri Lanka on working / residence visa and they stay in Sri Lanka at least for six months.
They obtain various health services from Sri Lankan hospitals during their stay in Sri Lanka. The new charge will be an additional income for Sri Lanka. These foreign nationals also pose a threat to Si Lankan health sector because there is a possibility of them bringing in certain diseases such as malaria which has already been eliminated from Sri Lanka, Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.

Former Wesley captain Zalique Jayah to lead in Dubai Sevens
DUBAI: Lanka Lions bolstered by fresh young talent are determined to regain the Gulf Mens Open title at the forthcoming Emirates Airline Dubai Sevens Rugby tournament.
Former Wesley and CH and FC three quarter Zalique Jayah will be leading the side for the first time in the blue riband rugby event in the UAE which begins on November 30 at The Sevens Stadium.
Im really honoured to become the captain of Lanka Lions and thank to the (Lanka Lions Sports Club) committee for supporting me and the boys for having faith in me to lead this side, said Jayah, 27, who captained Wesley College in 2008 and represented Southern Sharks at the Carlton International Sevens in Sri Lanka in 2013.
I hope to give my best to the team and expect same from boys with the aim of lifting the Cup for Lanka Lions, said Jayah, an Emirates cabin crew member who is playing in the Dubai Sevens for the fourth year.
We have a very good set of boys who are very keen on winning the Cup this year. We have many new players coming in and they are gelling into the team very nicely, added Jayah who will have the services of Madisha Silva, who led Lanka Lions to a historic triumph at the Emirates Airline Dubai Sevens Rugby tournament in 2015 by winning the Gulf Men's Open title for the first time.
Former Trinity College, Kandy players Dilshan Kelaniyangoda, Hilmy Bebo Mohammed and Anojan
Balasundaram are the other experienced players in the side which has been infused by new blood in Tharindu Malikge (Kingswood College, Kandy) and Miyuru Sandaruwan (Dharmaraja College, Kandy). Dubai Exiles youngsters Adil Deen and Jerry, who also plays for the UAE national team, also gives them the cutting edge.
Lanka Lions also known as Ceylon Warriors will get a chance to get their team combinations and strategies right when they compete in the Eden Park Sevens tournament. This annual UAE sevens tournament serves as a preparation for the domestic teams taking part in the Dubai Sevens.
Lanka Lions coach Richard Murcott, who guided the side to a historic double of Eden Park Sevens and Gulf Mens Open titles in 2015, said they had learnt from the mistakes of last year where they crashed out in the Cup semifinals at the Dubai Sevens.
We didnt recover enough from injuries. We had quite a lot of the squad carrying injuries. It has been taken care of this year, said the former Havelocks coach who will be unleashing a new strategy this time.
We are going to work towards strengths of side which of course is speed and agility of players. Having said that we will have to change our patterns because teams have learnt it now. We will playing lot of close-end rugby using a few of XVs skills as well because without ball in hand, a side is very weak, said Murcott with the Lanka Lions having begun preparations since August with the appointment of a new manager Jeremy Emmanuel and Fijian Jerry as assistant coach.
We wont be committing a lot into set pieces and stuff but when required we will change our plans. We will try these new patterns on 17th and see whether its going to work for us in the Dubai Sevens, said Murcroft who will not settle for anything less than the Cup.
Former Sri Lanka and Arabian Gulf legend Roger Rodrigo, who is Rugby Chairman at Lanka Lions Sports Club, expressed his gratitude to the team sponsors Ice Watch, Sri Lankan Airlines, Suren Agencies and World Wide for backing the team every year.

France's Macron makes surprise Saudi visit amid Lebanon crisis

French President Emmanuel Macron has paid an unscheduled visit to Saudi Arabia amid an escalating crisis between the kingdom and Lebanon.
His trip comes days after Lebanese PM Saad Hariri resigned while in Riyadh, saying he feared for his life.
Foes Saudi Arabia and Iran have accused each other of fuelling instability in Lebanon and the wider region.
Macron and Saudi officials also discussed the crisis in Yemen, where Riyadh is leading a war against rebels.
France has historical ties with Lebanon, as its former colonial power before it gained independence during World War Two.
The French president was in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday to open the Louvre Abu Dhabi, a spin-off of the famous Paris art museum.
Ahead of his two-hour visit to Riyadh, Macron said all Lebanese officials should live freely, "which means having a very demanding stance on those who could threaten any leader".
No details of the alleged plot against Hariri have been made public.
Uncertainty surrounds Hariri's circumstances, amid rumours he was being held in Riyadh.
Macron said on Thursday he had had informal contact with Hariri, without giving details, while France's foreign minister said France believed Hariri was able to move freely.
Hariri said in a TV broadcast on Saturday that he was stepping down because of the unspecified threat to his life.
In the video statement, Hariri also attacked Hezbollah, which is politically and militarily powerful in Lebanon, and Iran.
There are fears Lebanon could become embroiled in a wider regional confrontation between major Sunni power Saudi Arabia and Shia-dominated Iran.
Macron is a keen supporter of the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal, which both the Saudis and the Trump administration have heavily criticised.
Before going to Saudi Arabia, Macron said that he had heard "very harsh opinions" on Iran from Saudi Arabia, which did not match his own view. "It is important to speak with everyone," he added.
But an official communiqu from his office following the visit did not say Iran was among the matters discussed,French newspaper Le Monde reported.
Tensions between Saudi Arabia, Iran and Lebanon have soared since Hariri announced his resignation.
On Thursday, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies told their citizens in Lebanon to leave the country immediately. It came afterRiyadh accused Iran of "direct military aggression", saying it supplied a missile which it says was fired by Hezbollah at Riyadh from Yemen on Saturday.
Iran has dismissed the Saudi allegations as "false and dangerous".

'Grey's Anatomy' ends when Ellen Pompeo quits

"Grey's Anatomy" is hitting a milestone, but its creator said she can't promise many more.
The ABC medical drama's 300th episode is set to air Thursday and creator Shonda Rhimestold E!the show is done once star Ellen Pompeo no longer wants to portray Meredith Grey.
"Ellen and I have a pact that I'm going to do the show as long as she's going to do the show," Rhimes said. "So the show will exist as long as both of us want to do it. If she wants to stop, we're stopping."
Rhimes said she's not sure the show will make it to 600 episodes "but I want to keep it feeling fresh."
"As long as there are fresh stories to tell and as long as we're both excited about the stories being told, we're in," she said. "So we'll see where that takes us."
Take heart though, fans. The showrunner told "Entertainment Tonight" that she believes "Grey's," now in its 14th season, will exist at least as long as NBC's hit medical series "ER," which ran for 15 seasons.
For her part Pompeotold Good Housekeeping last yearthat it can be challenging portraying the same character for so many years.
"Some seasons, I've been in a rut," she confessed. "It's harder to give great performances 12 years in."

Today is World Science Day:
Growing up with science
Science for global understanding has been brought up by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as the theme for 2017, making it an ideal topic of discussion, an ideal act of relevance. The World Science day was named by the UNESCO to ensure that citizens are kept informed of the development of science.
In the current society, it is important to be aware how science, peace and development are interlinked. With the discovery of scientific concepts and new, cutting-edge technology, there will be an eminent effect on a conflict-free society, said Professor K. P. S. Chandana Jayaratne, Department of Physics, University of Colombo.
Science, as it is seen today, bridges the gap between ethnic groups, and even one another. The language of science being mathematics, there are no differences to it. That makes science an effective medium of communication to achieve harmony within our society.
Today, we are fortunate enough to have the barrier of language broken by science. With one click, one touch, one is able to translate any text or voice into any language that they understand. If one considers China as an instance, it is a known fact that not many Chinese citizens speak English. They use hand-held translators  abundantly available technology  to grow as a society. They publish research, theyre a scientifically advanced nation, said Prof. Jayaratne.
By using science to understand one another, our nation can move towards a promising development, he remarked.
Where do we stand
How deep has science reached its roots within our society Have we, as a nation, reached the place where we need to be Within the young generation, more or less, yes, answers Prof. Jayaratne. They are on par with international level, using technology. Devices such as computer and hand phone open you to the vast ocean of scientific knowledge through the internet.
But the older generation is somewhat reluctant when keeping up with the fast pace of development.
It makes it difficult for the country to move towards development when only one group is advancing, he remarked.
Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)/drones are used in some countries to carry out tasks like spraying pesticides in a farm. Such measures save time and much less labour is required to accomplish tough duties.
The scientific illiterate fraction of society, may it be old or young, is like the sticking glue that holds back the development, Professor Jayaratne added.
Solidarity and sharing knowledge
The need to connect Sri Lankan citizens with the international scientific community and among themselves is essential. As an outcome of the endeavours taken, international conferences, funded by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research are being held in Sri Lanka, each year. International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics brought 400 scientists and students, both national and international, together.
By such activities our students get inspired and that is what matters, said Prof. Jayaratne. We should take the student population into consideration and prepare them for inventions and innovations.
Among numerous endeavours, Vidatha Centers have done a large amount in sharing scientific knowledge. Knowledge is, to some extent, transferred to the public, confirmed Prof. Jayaratne. Vidatha Centers are implemented in a programme that ensures transfer of new technologies that has meaning to the rural communities. They are manned by young scientists who are willing to enlighten the public. Four hundred scientists were educated through these centers on lightening protection.
Sri Lanka Association for Advancement of Science plays an important role in bringing scientific knowledge to the public. Many scientists volunteer to educate students on district level on scientific topics  Nano-technology, astronomy, medicine, chemistry, physics, and biology, among others. Quizzes and competitions are held on all-Island level, as well, said Prof. Jayaratne.
Information and knowledge relating to this endeavour can be found on SLAAS.lk.
The role of the scientist
The need to engage the wider public in debates on emerging scientific issues is crucial. These issues may differ from society to society. For instance, one major issue that Sri Lanka faces, today, is the unbalanced patterns of rainfall due to increasing global warming. This causes extreme conditions such as floods, landslides and droughts.
And inventors are trying to give early warnings of these disasters, stated Prof. Jayaratne. Disaster Management Center has been contributing to resolve this issue. Committees are needed in village level to identify disasters and learn how to bring evacuation plans into action. Prof. Jayaratne also suggested that more science needs to be involved in tasks such as town-planning.
And today, we also face health issues concerning kidney functions. Water purification plants have been commissioned in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)-prone areas but the issue has not been addressed properly.
The role scientists play in broadening our understanding of the remarkable, fragile planet we call home and in making our societies more sustainable should not be limited to scientific discoveries, said Prof. Jayaratne.
Educating the public
In Sri Lanka, the research conducted isnt being brought to the awareness of the public. There is a communication gap between the scientist and the citizen, said Prof. Jayaratne. And if the newly emerging scientific knowledge is brought to the general public, a lot of discoveries will be more effective, he added. Countries like the United States and China have means of bringing scientific knowledge to the public in ways they understand. Television channels like Discovery educate the public. But in Sri Lanka, the role of media, in bringing science to the public, leaves something to be desired.
There ought to be a government policy which opens media to allocate space/time for science, the professor remarked. Television, radio, print and social media need to contribute more.
Media should help develop a scientific culture in the society because otherwise, it would hinder the sustainable development of the country. Media focuses almost solely on politics and music and this is not something to be happy about.
The government needs to prompt media to take action. It is also the duty of private institutions and individuals to step forward to move the society further, he said. And these groups and individuals need to be inspired to take action. If it continues this way, Sri Lanka will have to suffer a lot more than the other regions, said Prof. Jayaratne.
This is a task we, as a society, should take into hand. As individuals and as a whole, this journey belongs to each of us, and our future generation.
The pace is forever picking up and we, as a nation, should keep up with it. Science is everywhere, if only the eye is curious. If we look more closely, we can make the future brighter.

May end up with Sri Lanka
Hathurusingha resigns as Bangladesh coach
Chandika Hathurusingha, the former Sri Lanka cricketer and presently coach of Bangladesh is tipped to take over a head coach of Sri Lanka after he tendered his resignation to the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) yesterday.
Whether that resignation will be accepted by the BCB, and if it will actually result in Hathurusinghas exit remains to be seen. Hathurusingha and top officials at the BCB have not officially confirmed these developments, but are not denying them.
Meanwhile, there are strong signals from Sri Lanka Cricket that they are pursuing Hathurusingha, and are in fact presently in negotiations with him.
There have been increasing recent signs that despite Bangladeshs many improvements during his tenure, Hathurusingha is unsatisfied with the state of his present role. He had once already moved to resign in October last year, but the BCB had not accepted his resignation and Hathurusingha was convinced to continue.
Now, however there is the additional lure of a job in his home country. SLC has been on the hunt for a new head coach since Graham Ford resigned in June, and had, in fact, already approached Hathurusingha over the past three months.
Though Hathurusingha had eventually rebuffed SLC on that first occasion, recent developments may have made the Sri Lanka role more attractive to Hathurusingha.
SLC has just hired Hathurusinghas longtime friend and associate Thilan Samaraweera as batting coach which is seen as a precursor to Hathurusingha moving to Sri Lanka. Then there has also been a change in the selection committee as well with former Sri Lanka fast bowler Graeme Labrooy taking over with a new look committee.
It is learnt that SLC is prepared to pay Hathurusingha what he presently earns with the BCB - a substantial commitment to SLC.
Hathurusingha, a former Sri Lanka cricketer was one time shadow coach of the national team and was being groomed to take over from Trevor Bayliss as head coach, but the interim administration at that time under DS de Silva terminated his services on disciplinary grounds that saw him take up a post as assistant coach of New South Wales from where he moved to become coach of Bangladesh.
Hathurusingha also has contractual obligations to fulfill having been given an extension in the middle of last year, he has signed with the BCB until the end of the 2019 World Cup. Leaving his contract is likely to be a complicated proposition, possibly involving SLC having to pay quite a substantial amount to the BCB to have him released.
If Hathurusingha does end up leaving his position, however, it will bring to an end a tenure that lasted over three years and oversaw substantial gains by the Bangladesh side, particularly in ODI cricket.
In major tournaments, Bangladesh made the quarter-final of the 2015 World Cup and the semi-final of the 2017 Champions Trophy. They had also defeated India, Pakistan and South Africa in home bilateral series, and have climbed up the ODI rankings as a result.
In Tests, Bangladesh registered their first-ever wins against England and Australia at home, and against Sri Lanka away. The team has, however, recently returned from a dispiriting tour to South Africa.

Implementing development activities is main duty of PCs and LG bodies  Minister Samarasinghe
Port and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday stressed the importance of strengthening Provincial Councils and Local Government Bodies allocating more funds to them to implement countrys development activities more effectively.
Addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP Head office, Minister Samarasinghe said that the implementation of development activities is the main duty of Provincial Councils and Local Government bodies and the most important duty of the Parliament is to pass legislation. Some Parliamentarians who do not have a clear idea about the most important duty of them are attempting to play the role of Provincial Councilors and Members of Local Government bodies, Minister Samarasinghe said.
The Minister charged that Provincial Councils have failed to use the powers already given to them. They have not yet examined the 13th Amendment to the Constitution to see what powers have already been granted. The SLFP is very clear in its policy to oppose a Federal solution. Such a solution would be unconstitutional and would lead to disturbances by strengthening extremism, said Minister Samarasinghe.
He said the government would not go beyond the 13th Amendment to the Constitution adopted in 1987.
Powers remaining to be granted only within the framework of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution should be granted but not a federal solution, Minister said. He further said that the Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly is only a document without an owner. It was submitted by the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe only as the Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly and not as the party leader of the UNP.
Some political parties tried to get political advantages by emphasizing this report as a draft of the Constitution. This Interim Report was only views of all parties and people made during 73 meetings of the Constitutional Assembly. The Constitutional Assembly will meet further to work on the next step to bring about a new Constitution, said Minister Samarasinghe.
He said that SLFP has clearly submitted its views in the Interim Report and according to that the SLFP would not oppose power devolution within the limits specified in the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.
The Minister said that the SLFP also believes that the Executive Presidency and Executive power that had been exercised by a Provincial Governor should be remained unchanged.
Commenting on Executive Prime Minister proposed by various groups, Minister Samarasinghe said that the Executive President is directly elected by people and each and every citizen has the freedom to cast their vote to select an Executive President. But a Prime Minister is appointed with the majority support in the Parliament. So he cannot work independently.

IS left clinging to scraps in Syria and Iraq
Syrias army announced Thursday the capture of the last town held by the Islamic State group in the country, driving yet another nail into the coffin of its transborder caliphate.
The latest loss leaves the jihadists clinging on to just a few small pockets of territory in Iraq and Syria, a far cry from the vast stretches they controlled after rampaging across the region in 2014.
Here are the remaining IS holdouts:
After Thursdays loss of the town of Albu Kamal on the border with Iraq, IS is left in control of some two dozen desert villages along the Euphrates river in the surrounding oil-rich Deir Ezzor province that once provided a major source of the groups illicit income.
The jihadists are confronted there both by Syrian regime forces backed up by Russian air power and a coalition of Kurdish and Arab fighters supported by a US-led coalition.
Away from the barren frontier region, IS retains a presence in the Yarmuk refugee camp and the Hajar Aswad district just south of the capital Damascus, where the group is battling other jihadists and pro-regime forces.
In the central region of Homs IS is being squeezed by troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and their Russian backers as it struggles to maintain its grip on a few small areas.
To the south in Daraa province on the border with Jordan an affiliated group called Jaish Khaled Bin Walid is mainly battling rebel groups.
After a brutal campaign that has seen them recapture a string of major cities, Iraqi forces are currently waging a final offensive along their side of the frontier with Syria to wipe out the last remnants of IS territory.
The capture of the key town of Al-Qaim and a nearby border crossing on November 3 left the smaller neighbouring outpost of Rawa and surrounding scraps of desert as all that remains under IS control in Iraq.
The frontier area of Iraqs Anbar province is dominated by a handful of powerful Sunni tribes, some of which have dispatched fighters to battle IS alongside government forces.
The region has been known as a hotbed of jihadist insurgency and smuggling since the US-led invasion of Iraq ousted Saddam Hussein in 2003, long before the arrival of IS in 2014. -

MAKE THE BREAK- JETWING YALA DUNE AND BEACH SAFARIS
Its early morning and the sun has just risen, hanging low in a white misty sky hovering over the horizon where the sea meets the sand dunes. The air is comfortingly warm and moist against a roller coaster ocean that reminds me of Niagara Falls. Even though it is now just past six and half asleep, I get that excited rush as I see waves frothing up, exploding as they crash around like water monsters getting ready for the days water safari, with an army of white horses assembling behind them stretching out to the oceans horizon.
The ultimate rush
As I enter the deep blue sea it is refreshingly cool but not cold. Within a short time I am in a mad unpredictable sea, like being at the fair ground on the ghost train roller coaster, I feel the adrenaline pumping as the waves come full throttle in leaps and bounds of many shapes and sizes. But for me this is just the challenge I need to get my blood racing and body firing, a chance to flex all those muscles in all kinds of ways and battle with nature in the raw.
I am flanked by two life guards in yellow and lots of children jumping over the break laughing as they ride their way back into the dunes and on lookers from the uber cool lookout point and beach bar.
Off I go again covered in sun cream slashing through rows of waves, the current pulls me mercilessly down the beach whilst a large doubled up wave throws me into the washing machine at top spin, only to spit me out again, in a foot of water, sitting rather dazed and stupid on the sand being firmly chastised go back to the land where you belong.
Undaunted, I return to the shore and grab my surf board and once again take on the great unknown the ocean in search of the ultimate rush of a 20 foot monster. But, like Sisyphus rolling his rock up the hill and never quite making it, but half the fun is trying as another wave rolls in this time over 15 feet high.
Exciting activities
Back on the sand I hand my board back to the Jetwing Yala beach life guard team and head off for an excellent buffet breakfast trying to stand up right with my battered exhilarated frame and Rudolph the red nose whip lash from the sun and sea  the rest of the day will be a gentle delight of earthly pleasures indulging in a sea salt fish cooking class, spa treatments under a tree by the pool and observing the effortless wanderings and beauty of the wildlife evening with the hotel naturalist who takes the tented guests on special bird and wildlife watching tours along the parameter of the property.
The next day I go wreck diving to look for treasure discovered by Science Fiction writer Arthur C Clark around the Great Basses ship wreck about 12 km offshore, a vessel carrying cannons, other artifacts and a treasure trove of solid silver rupees that were sent to buy marble for building Indias Taj Mahal and like the worlds greatest monument to love, now sit immortalised and fused within the reef that so many sailors feared and revered. Because of the restrictions imposed by the 30 year civil war, technology has not yet conquered this wreck so who knows what is still down there! Sadly the weather was against us and we only saw some of the treasure in the little museum and enjoyed haggling at Kirinda harbour for the evenings fish.
Jetwing Yala always has lots of exciting activities going one and we played endless games in the well-stocked bar each evening only stopping to see an elephant from time to time passing buy or herd of naughty monkeys jumping across the top roof, a place they saw as safe to sleep at night. Who is to blame the mischievous troop of grey langours as only the night before a group had seen a leopard on the road next to the hotel and on hearing the wildlife alarm calls of many of the animals, it reminded us just how close we are to the action staying at Jetwing Yala.

Material Science Engineering to boost  production economy of the country

Material Science and Engineering (MSE) by benchmarking with global trends could effectively contribute towards establishing a sustainable production economy in the Sri Lankan industrial sector, said Moratuwa Universitys MSE Department Head, Sampath Weragoda at Department- Industry consultative session held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute.
Speaking on the theme MSE towards instilling a sustainable manufacturing economy he affirmed, Moratuwa University MSE department via its research and development, training, testing and consultancy capabilities is on a quest to stem an endemic engineering culture of material science and engineering in Sri Lanka.
MSE is a combination of chemistry, physics and mathematics that contributes towards product innovation, stringent quality testing and cost reduction. Hence the domain of a Materials Engineer is unique. We need integration between the university, business community and the government to propel the Triple helix of the MSE machine. With a deeper insight to corporate life, university lecturers too could develop case-studies and real-life examples that will endow students with the knowledge on genuine industry needs, he further stated.
In 2015 the departments curriculum underwent a major revision and is constantly evolving to serve the needs of the Sri Lankan industry.
Guest speaker, Brandix Lanka Limited COO, Pushpasiri Bandara said industries such as textile, automobile, manufacturing, steel and medical world over, hire MSE experts. He stressed a strong link should be built between local universities and the industry sector for the undergrads and lecturers to derive hands-on experience from real-life situations in the industry sector.
Employing a MSE expert is certainly a feather in the cap for an industry. However, local universities must do aggressive marketing to make the industry aware of the formers capabilities. University students too should improve their soft skills and understand industry ethics since the industry needs practical oriented individuals as mere theoretical approaches do not fulfill its needs, he said.
Guest speaker, National Science Foundation working committee on technology member, Dr Azeez Mubarak said, research and development and innovation pave way for countries in the middle-income segment to elevate to high-income segment, yet investment on R&D in Sri Lanka is minimal.
Though MSE experts champion R&D, Sri Lanka has only 230 odd active R&D personnel and limited R&D project proposals come from the universities.
By interacting with the industry sector, university MSE experts could understand the real needs of the industry to formulate productive and innovative R&D proposals, he opined.

## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, November 10, 2017 - 01:00
Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera's second death anniversary:
May his legacy live on
Fish continue to swim under the soft coral growth. The coral growths house a pond divided by a bridge which leads to the monastery. The monastery sheltered a spiritual leader of this country. As you enter the Kotte Sri Naga Vihara premises, the life-size statue of its previous Chief Incumbent greets you with a fatherly smile.
Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera needs hardly any introduction owing to his involvement in bringing the incumbent government into power. But his missionary journey began a long time before. For those who knew him up close and personal, the life-size statue will bring back the larger-than-life legacy left behind by the legendary Sangha figure.
The Sinhalese community has maintained an irrevocable connection with the Sangha Order since times immemorial. Even the numerous invasions could not sever that connection. The colonial masters tried their best to dissociate the cord between the Sangha and community. Their attempts to relieve this land of the Sacred Tooth Relic are a classic example.
Like the fish continuing to swim under the soft coral growth, the relationship between the Sangha and the Sinhalese communities flourished. The Sangha community, with an orchestra-like division of sects, exerted a large influence over the general public. Thanks to this influence, many other communities found solace in this land. Sri Lanka is the ideal melting pot for any ethnic community because of the Buddhist influence.
That the royalty consulted the Sangha both at times of trouble and otherwise has been the norm. The Sangha community, for that matter, intervened when they deemed it necessary. Unruly their behaviour may seem to the run of the mill. But such kind of intervention may be necessary at times.
Excellent orator, influential figure
Venerable Sobitha Theras public presence turned out to be an offshoot of such circumstances. Which is why his public presence could not be termed as an overnight feat. He shot down his first salvo during the tenure of President J R Jayewardene (from 1977 to 1988).
The Venerable Thera dealt with many aspects such as centralising power within the presidency, the threats against freedom of expression, civil rights and the rule of law. He was a vociferous speaker against the Indian intervention campaign in the 1980s.
What was quite charming about the Venerable Thera
Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera had a deep, resonant, voice. That made him not only an excellent orator but an influential figure, much sought after in the Sri Lankan majority community.
Although he was the kingmaker, he did not live in the lap of luxury. He had his own lifestyle strictly focused on principles and precepts. That charisma in him sent shockwaves through the society when he publicly announced that he would contest for the presidency.
As a saint perched on the mountain, he saw every head of state, appointed to office following his blessings, only solidarising their positions within the presidency. He observed all that silently and took revolutionary steps when necessary. While playing a national role, the Thera also shouldered other tasks such as educating the youth on the dangers of drugs and alcohol abuse.
Venerable Sobitha Thera had no special affinity to any political leader in particular. He treated every politician like any elder would treat a child. He was not hesitant to point out whenever they erred. That rare personality in this Sangha figure stood tall wherever he trod. That is the emblem of this social reformer called Ven Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera.
As the Chief Incumbent of the Kotte Naga Vihara, Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera was an avant-garde socialist and social reformer. Born on May 29, a Vesak Full Moon Poya Day in 1942, in Maduluwawa, Padukka, Homagama, he obtained the primary education at Maduluwawa Maha Vidyalaya. Pathirage Don Rathnasekara (as he was known in the lay life) took up robes at 11 on May 9, 1955.
Legacy awaiting excavation
Ven Sobitha Thera was an amiable elder to any devotee he sights at the temple. He did not care very much about his popularity (or civil power, rather) when he opens up a conversation with a devotee. Even though he is too busy for a small talk, he would certainly greet you with his warm smile.
The Theras real personality rests alive at the Naga Vihara. Although smaller in size as compared to most mainstream Buddhist temples, Naga Vihara is home to verdant greenery. The bridge, the pond underneath and schools of fish swimming leisurely are a signatory sight of the entrance to his little abode.
And you were always welcome to enter this little green kingdom. A devotee or two would often ask the Thera for a plant or two. Ven Sobitha Thera would not think twice in such instances. He would generously offer a plant. In his own territory, Ven Thera lived with much ease. No politician could shake him with luxury. He won the hearts of devotees. They were the patrons who looked after him well even during the tough times when he had fallen from the grace of certain politicians.
Venerable Sobitha Thera is no more. But he has left behind a legacy awaiting excavation.

Natural gas power plant to supply Chinese funded Industrial Zone
The Chinese will build a 400MW Natural Gas Power Plant in Hambantota to supply power to the Chinese funded Industrial Zone in the area.
Cabinet this week granted approval for a joint venture project between the company China Machinery Engineering Corporation and the Ceylon Electricity Board for the plant. According to the Cabinet paper on the subject, the agreement at present, proposed a 70:30 percent shareholding between the two entities.
As all power plants need to be approved by the Public Utilities Commission, this too would be included in the 2017-2037 long term energy plan approved by the Public Utilities Commission.
In May 2017, two agreements were signed between the Government of Sri Lankan and that of China. One was the Framework agreement between the government of the Peoples Republic of China and the Government of Sri Lanka for the proportion of investment and economic cooperation and the other was the outline of the medium and long term development plan for investment, economic and technological cooperation.
The agreements agreed for the establishment of a power plant in Hambantota and a natural gas receiving terminal as a joint venture project between a company nominated by the Chinese Government and Sri Lanka.
The power plan is expected to provide electricity to factories set up in Hambantota by the Chinese companies.
The Chinese had pointed out that an uninterrupted and reliable power supply was needed for industries and that industries could not be built without power- thus the power plant will be built first.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Management which had studied the project, had also decided that the power plant be constructed as an Independent Power Producer power plant on government to government basis first and once the factories are established, a suitable plan could be formulated thereafter as to the mechanism of how power would be purchased or sold.
Last week, Sri Lanka and China jointly launched the Sri Lanka-China Logistics and Industrial Zone Office at the Hambantota Port to overlook the operation of the 50-square-kilometer Industrial Zone established in January.

The President Maithripala Sirisena as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, addressed a representative gathering of more than 350 Commanding Officers (COs), Adjutants and Regimental Sergeant Majors (RSMs) of the Army, at the Colombo Army Hospital auditorium last evening.
Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne and Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake, Commander of the Army extended a warm welcome to the President on his arrival at the premises and ushered him to the main auditorium.
The President thanked the Secretary Defence and the Commander of the Army for arranging this meet and called upon each one to continue with their dedicated roles for the sake of the country.
You all have dedicatedly come forward to safeguard the country and also in times of national disasters all the time at the risk of your own lives, for which we are indebted to you. In the most recent past, you all stood by the nation and took the lead when national disasters, epidemics, landslides, etc struck us and I need your continued support for development of our country as we march forward as a peaceful society, rich with co-existence, reconciliation, harmony and understanding.
As long as I remain the head of the country, I assure you that none of you would be allowed to testify before any war tribunals. Instead, such errant Army personnel, if any can be produced before Courts and tried according to the existing law of the country. Unlike the disgruntled politicians and some retired Army personnel allege saying that the War Heroes would be tried and punished, I, as the President of this country would not allow anyone be subjected to interrogations of foreign judges as such. Therefore you should not be misled by those baseless allegations and misleading statements.
He emphasized that no Human Rights organizations in the world be allowed to pressurise the Sri Lanka Army on whatever the grounds and the UN has been informed of our capacity to find solutions to our own problems without any interference as a sovereign State.
I also appeal all of you to believe in me and not to be misled by statements, rumours and our detractors. I commend all of you for the excellent services you rendered during the times of natural disasters and request you to extend your best cooperation for sustenance of reconciliation and peace in the country as a nation. I also wish to insist that unlike in the past, no War Heros overseas visa would be denied in future and will ensure their overseas visits are facilitated without any hindrance.

Opposition Leader hails Budget 2018
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan commended the Budget stating that it included proposals beneficial to all people including the Tamils, while TNA MP Sumanthiran speaking on the same line said their proposals too have been accommodated in the Budget. They stressed the need to implement the budgetary proposals in full.
The maiden Budget speech of Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera was commended by many Parliamentarians in the Government benches as encouraging and forward looking, while the Joint Opposition and JVP members hardly had any positive comments to make to the media on the Budget 2018.
The Parliamentarians when they left the chamber after listening to two and half hours long Budget speech, expressed mixed feelings over the budgetary proposals for next year. Many Parliamentarians, however, praised the move to reduce the prices of hybrid and electric vehicles.
Leader of the House and Minister of Higher Education and Highways Lakshman Kiriella congratulated Minister Samaraweera for presenting a progressive and well-planned Budget despite the country being riddled with a massive debt burden.
Chief Government Whip and Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake was confident that the maiden Budget of Minister Samaraweera would usher in a good future to the country.
SLFP General Secretary and Minister of Agriculture Duminda Dissanayake said the Budget would lay a solid foundation to the countrys economy. He added that the Budget that encompasses the proposals two major parties gives a hope for a better future.
UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries and State Minister of Mahaweli Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera speaking on the same page with Duminda Dissanayake said the Budget has also proposed a host of relief measures and concessions to the needy sectors. He highlighted the special measures taken by the Government to bring down the Cost of Living of the people.
Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said the Budget that concentrates on Green Economy has taken special interest on conserving the environment and preventing environmental pollution. He commended the tax reduction of small cars and the incentives given to young entrepreneurs.
Policy Planning and Economic Development Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said the Budget 2018 would drive the country towards a knowledge based highly competitive social market economy.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Dissanayake objected to the Budget on the grounds that it follows the principles of open economy that have been proven unsuccessful. He said the Government would further burden the already debt-ridden economy with more loans.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa termed the Budget as useless stating that most of the budgetary proposals of the previous year are also yet to be implemented. These proposals look good for the paper, but they are hardly implemented in reality, he commented.

Pakistan bus crash kills 26
PAKISTAN: At least 26 people were killed and 46 others injured when a passenger bus plunged into a ravine in northern Pakistan, police said Thursday.
The crash took place near Dhok Pathan village, some 115 kilometres (70 miles) southwest of the capital Islamabad late Wednesday.
At least 26 people have died and 46 others were injured when a passenger bus lost control at a slope and veered off into a deep ravine, local police official Fazal Abbas told AFP. The bus was carrying members of Tableeghi Jamaat - a Sunni evangelical group - from the northwestern town of Kohat to the eastern city of Raiwind, near Lahore where their annual gathering was taking place, he added.
Abbas said that most of the injured were discharged from hospital after receiving medical treatment, but at least 10 seriously wounded passengers were sent to Rawalpindi, a garrison city adjoining the capital Islamabad. Officials added that the bus was not driving on its usual route when it crashed and was plying hilly roads after another motorway had been closed due to dense fog and traffic. A local government official confirmed the accident and toll. Pakistan has one of the world's worst records for fatal traffic accidents, many of them blamed on poor roads, badly maintained vehicles and reckless driving. - AFP

Pension on any day through Pan Asia  Sammana Account
Pan Asia Sammana Account was specially introduced for all pensioners who have given their best years for the country and are now enjoying life in retirement.
As a result of the popularity of this account, the bank has decided to add several new value added features to this account.
Pan Asia Banks Deputy General Manager-Marketing and Personal Banking Nalaka Wijayawardana had this to say at a question and answer session.
Q: What is the Sammana Pension Loan Scheme
A: A few years ago, banks were not very keen on giving out loans to pensioners. Pan Asia Bank realizing this problem set an example for the whole country by coming forward with the Sammana Pension Loan Scheme. We realized that these individuals who have basically given their lives to serve Sri Lanka still had much more to contribute towards economic development of their country. We also realized that these individuals had a strong desire and an ability to carry on their lives without being a burden to the country or their own children. It is in light of those reasons that we introduced the Sammana Pension Loan Scheme. This scheme enables a pensioner to divert his/her pension to Pan Asia Bank and obtain a loan of up to 2 million. A special feature of this account is the fact that the loan repayment period could be extended up to 10 years. Another unique feature of this loan is that it does not require guarantors.
Q: As a result of introducing this account what progress have you seen
A: By now, we have facilitated a large number of loans. This has helped many pensioners earn an additional income through self-employment. The fact that these people dont become a burden to anyone and have the ability to financially support their children and contribute positively to the national economy is source of great pride for us.
There are also some who obtain this loan to fulfil their duties towards their children such as bearing the cost of their weddings. Then there are others that utilize this loan scheme to go on pilgrimages. Another special feature is that they get an insurance cover when they take a loan. Therefore, in an unfortunate event of the demise of a loan applicant, rest of the family is protected as they are not burdened with the repayment of the loan.
Q: What are the new benefits recently introduced into this account
A: The pension is received on a predetermined day of the month. If a financial emergency arises between two pension payment dates most people find themselves in quite a difficult state. To help in emergencies such as these we have introduced a facility by which an interest free pension advance may be obtained at a nominal fee. As a result, a pensioner could obtain an advance on their pension on any day by visiting any branch of the bank. The maximum a person may borrow through this service is Rs. 30,000/- and the minimum is Rs 5000/-.
Q: What are the other benefits these account holders get
A: Apart from the above mentioned benefits, we have also introduced a discount scheme for Sammana accountholders. As a result, they can enjoy great discounts at selected bookshops, opticians and insurance companies etc.
Q: What is the eligibility criteria to get one of these loans
A: Government Pensioners under the age of 70 with a monthly pension of Rs. 10,000/- or more may instruct their pension to be credited to a Pan Asia Bank Sammana account to avail themselves of those benefits.
Q: How does one get more information and details about this account
A: Customers can call the banks 24x7/365 customer contact centre, or they can visit any Pan Asia Bank Branch to get more details.

Pothas warns Sri Lanka  not to be infatuated by India
Sri Lanka coach Nic Pothas while insisting that the teams culture had changed for the better stressed on his players the need to not be infatuated with Indias strengths but to focus on Sri Lankas game plans instead.
The mistake you can make here is come and be infatuated with the Indian side and concentrate too much on them, Pothas said on the teams arrival in India.
We know they are a good side. We only played them a month ago. We have to concentrate on our strengths and jobs, and if we can execute them well it will be a challenging series.
There are not too many people who have the joy of playing India back to back. Its always a pleasure to come here and challenge ourselves against a very, very good team. I think where we have changed is the culture within group. When we took on India [in Sri Lanka], we were all pretty new from the support staff to the players involved. We are now a team that pride ourselves in our culture. We defend it and we focus on ourselves.
Pothas said the thrashing at home from India had proved to be a sound learning experience, and that the team had absorbed those lessons. The series against India was a huge learner for us.
I also mentioned that if we didnt learn from a very good team then that would have been the biggest error. We did go back to the lessons we learnt - what India does very, very well and the areas we needed to improve.
It was a complete different [Test] series against Pakistan. It was 41 degrees and they had lost two legends. That probably made things a little bit easier for us. But the Indian team is very settled team and all their players are at their peak. So its a completely different challenge, especially here in India.
Not many teams have come here in the last few years and won. But what changed for us is internally - the discipline, the culture and how the teams stuck together, the characters that we have picked. As much as the skill and preparation has changed, what we have done internally has changed as well.
Captain Chandimal, playing his first Test series in India, said the team had been working hard at practice. He also said the batting group had plans to counter the spin threat posed by R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja but did not divulge what those were.
This is my first Test tour to India, he said. Its a really good challenge for each and every one. As I said, we are doing hard work at practice sessions, especially before coming here, in Bangkok, we did so much hard work at practice. I am sure you can see the new faces - Dasun Shanaka, Dhananjaya de Silva, Roshen Silva, and also Sadeera [Samarawickrama]. Im sure they will be up for the challenge and do their best in the series.
Against Pakistan, we played six batters and five bowlers that worked really well, especially in the heat it was never easy to play four bowlers and win a game. If you are playing against India... they have got some really good bowlers, so we need to think about that all-rounder position. We will look at the pitch and come up with our plans.

Gunawardena said they were obstructed by officials when they arrived in parliament on pushbikes. The MPs came to the parliamentary complex on bicycles and a bullock cart. Police officials on duty at the parliament entrance prevented them from entering.
Senior Parliament police officers who rushed to the scene allowed them to enter. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament that he will look into the incident to ascertain whether the parliamentarians faced any obstructions at the entrance.

President Trump to address key APEC summit in Vietnam
US President Donald Trump and other world leaders are to address the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit in Vietnam, with trade and growth high on the agenda.
Trump has vowed to correct a huge trade imbalance with China and Japan.
China on Thursday said it would lower market entry barriers to some sectors, during Trump's visit to Beijing.
Talks between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are yet to be confirmed at the summit in Da Nang.
APEC brings together 21 economies - the equivalent of about 60% of the world's GDP.
Trump is due make a speech at 06:30 GMT. He will be followed by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
While discussing China's huge trade surplus on a state visit in Beijing, the US leader surprised many when he said he did "not blame China" for "taking advantage".
Instead, Trump said previous US administrations were responsible for what he called "a very unfair and one-sided" trade relationship with China.
Meanwhile, the Chinese foreign ministry said that Beijing would further lower entry barriers in the banking, insurance, and finance sectors, and gradually reduce vehicle tariffs.
Deals worth $250bn (190bn) were also announced, although it was unclear how much of that figure included past agreements or potential future deals.
At the same time, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told journalists the deals were "pretty small" in terms of tackling the trade imbalance.
Trump has in the past accused China of stealing American jobs and threatened to label it a currency manipulator, though he has since rowed back on such rhetoric.
Xi on Thursday promised "healthy" and "balanced" economic and trade relations.
The total trade relationship between the US and China was worth $648bn last year, but trade was heavily skewed in China's favour with the US amassing a nearly $310bn deficit.
Before the Beijing talks, Trump in Tokyo lashed out at Japan, saying it "has been winning" on trade in recent decades.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will also be making a speech at the APEC summit.
Japan had a $69bn (52.8bn) trade surplus with the US in 2016, according to the US Treasury department.
Earlier this week, Trump also visited South Korea, and will end his 12-day Asian tour in the Philippines on 13 November.

REMINISCENCES:  PART 1
In 1990 I became the first Medical Superintendent of this facility and take a great pleasure when going down the memory lane. Later, I was elevated to the position of Deputy Director in charge and continued until I was appointed as the Director NHSL in the year 2000 where I continued to serve until my retirement in 2011.
What the First Deputy Director and the former Director  NHSL has to say
The new Accident Service is celebrating its 25th Anniversary this year. One might wonder why it is called new when it is 25 years old. But a person close to it would not wonder. The first ever Accident Service was established in the landmark Victoria Memorial Building on Ward Place in 1956 with very limited facilities. The present one, we used to call as the new Accident Service.
In 1990 I became the first Medical Superintendent of this facility and take a great pleasure when going down the memory lane. Later, I was elevated to the position of Deputy Director in charge and continued until I was appointed as the Director NHSL in the year 2000 where I continued to serve until my retirement in 2011.
I was the leader of a dedicated team in the Accident Service for 10 years and provided guidance and supervision as Director NHSL for another 11 years. In fact my association with the Accident Service runs into more than half my career and this was the most critical and challenging period. The occasion of celebrating the silver jubilee of the Accident Service provides me a rare opportunity wrapped with honour to reminisce that period of 21 memorable years.
I was the District Medical Officer, Panadura in 1989 when the Ministry of Teaching Hospitals was looking for an eligible candidate to occupy the newly created post of Medical Superintendent of the newly created Accident Service of the General Hospital Colombo (GHC). I tried my luck and it worked. I came to General Hospital, Colombo to take charge of Accident Service as its first Medical Superintendent. Dr. Oliver Fernando a senior Medical Administrator was the Director-GHC. I reported to him.
A Fellowship in the Management of Accident and Emergency Services in the UK for one year sponsored by the British Council was attached to this position. It is my understanding that Dr. Lucian Jayasuriya- the Director General of Teaching Hospitals along with Daya Samarasinghe  Secretary of the Ministry were instrumental in planning and organizing this fellowship with the approval of Sunethra Ranasinghe - Minister of Teaching Hospitals.
I flew into the winter in September 1989 and returned after successful completion of my one year training in UK. During my training I had the opportunity to work in the Birmingham Accident Hospital, a hospital dedicated to Trauma. The training programme was comprehensive and well organised to cater to the needs of a developing country. I was also exposed to Accident & Emergency Departments in a few hospitals in West Midlands.
I returned to assume duties as the first Medical Superintendent of the New Accident Service after the training in September 1990. The newly constructed building was ready and state-of-the art medical equipment was on its way to the Accident Service for installation.
A team of consultants and a few technical personnel were still busy in making the final touches to the new building. The taking over and handing over of many different items worth of hundreds of millions of Rupees was taking place at the time. The entire team including matrons, nursing sisters, nurses in charge, pharmacists, radiographers and many others later told me that this was the most hectic period in their career.
The new building was complete with all the latest equipment and a generous gift to Sri Lankan people from the Government and people of Finland. This land mark complex has witnessed and will continue to witness the gratitude of a nation of this tiny island in the Indian Ocean to a generous nation in far north of Europe. This facility occupied the top most place of the Finnish Aid Programme.
Finland donated a Building designed ideally suited to a tropical country. Air conditioning is restricted to the essential areas and the remaining area is provided with fresh air through natural ventilation making the best use of sunlight bringing the hospital electricity bill to a minimum.
The new Accident Service with all the latest equipment was not a mere replacement of an old facility; it brought a revolutionary change to the old accident service established 60 years back. The thoughtful innovative improvements introduced in space and other facilities gave a feeling that the new accident service was very spacious and equipped with modern facilities equally beneficial to staff as well as patients. We felt this more strongly especially during the years of Sri Lankas civil conflict demanding emergency medical care for the victims of terror attacks.
I wish to express my deepest gratitude to Anika and Juhani Annanpalo and Dr. Lucian Jayasuriya who were working in the Finnish Project for their readily available advice, support and encouragement being a great source of strength to me.
The new building has the Accident Service OPD, Intensive Care Units, Radiology Department, operating theatres and a blood bank on the ground floor. It has a male and female observation ward, four orthopaedic wards, CSSD and a theatre complex dedicated for orthopaedic surgery. In fact the new facility was not a mere replacement of the existing facility. It was a combination of accident service and orthopaedic wards with operating theatres. In recognition of this fact the new complex was designated as Accident and Orthopaedic Service (AOS).
As a result of the untiring work of the team we were ready to commission the new AOS Building and to receive patients by March 1991. New Accident Service was opened by the then President Ranasinghe Premadasa on March 16, 1991. The Ambassador for Finland, Health Minister Renuka Herath and Health Ministry Secretary Dr. Joe Fernando graced the occasion with a large number of doctors, nurses and other employees of the hospital, Project officials and distinguished invitees participating at the event. The opening of this new facility marked the dawn of a new era in Trauma care services in Sri Lanka.
For the first time a Triage Unit manned by trained nurses was established to receive and assess the patients as they are brought in. Although the novel change was a consolation to patients and their caregivers, it was not without resistance. The opposition came from within and mainly from Trade Unions. This system now operates in other hospitals as well which is also a very effective public relations exercise.
On the advice of the Finnish Team that worked with us, during the first year a separate unit was established to look into the Training needs of various categories of employees and to coordinate all the training activities in a better organised manner.
For the first time the Janitorial service and security service was out-sourced to the private sector with the commissioning of the Accident Service. It was extended to all the other units of the hospital later as it was found to be very productive and cost effective.
In the past, the common hospital laundry did not have the capacity to cater to the entire hospital by providing washed and dried linen on time. This compelled us to seek the services of a few laundrymen (dhobies) who used to collect all the soiled linen, wash them manually and dry them in open areas of the hospital.
There were instances where we had to postpone the routine operations due to non-availability of washed and dried linen during the rainy weather. The need to have a well equipped laundry with sufficient number of industrial type washing machines, driers and pressing machines for the smooth running of the hospital was identified by the Project and was fulfilled. The present laundry is fully geared to cater to the entire hospital. More than 4000 Kgs of soiled linen is washed and dried on a daily basis in the laundry.
Continuous uninterrupted water supply is very vital for smooth functioning of a hospital. This need was fulfilled by constructing a massive water tower with a capacity of 100,000 gallons and with a dedicated supply line from Maligakanda reservoir by the Finnish project. Any person who walks down the Regent Street would not miss this water tower which stands tall as a landmark at the Cardiology unit end of Regent Street. Since the installation of this water tower we never experienced an interruption of water supply to the hospital.
Transporting the large cylinders filled with oxygen to the hospital and taking the empty cylinders back for refilling to the private company was done by hospital employees. They performed this task daily and on some days a few times a day. This ensured the continuous availability of medical oxygen to all the operating theatres and intensive care units of the hospital. This was very cumbersome and made me nervous when there is a delay in bringing the refilled cylinders back.
To be continued tomorrow...

Saudi Arabia says  201 people detained
SAUDI ARABIA: Saudi Arabia said Thursday 201 people are being held for questioning in a massive anti-graft swoop on the elite, with at least $100 billion estimated to have been lost through corruption and embezzlement over several decades.
A total of 208 individuals have been called in for questioning so far. Of those 208 individuals, seven have been released without charge, the information ministry said in a statement.
Billionaire tycoon Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, dubbed Saudi Arabia's Warren Buffett, was among dozens of high-profile figures arrested or sacked last weekend, in the biggest purge of the kingdom's elite in its modern history.
Authorities have frozen the bank accounts of the accused and warned that assets related to the corruption cases would be seized as state property, as the government appears set to widen the crackdown.
The potential scale of corrupt practices which have been uncovered is very large, the ministry said.
Based on our investigations over the past three years, we estimate that at least USD $100 billion has been misused through systematic corruption and embezzlement over several decades. The purge came just after an anti-graft commission headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was established on Saturday.
With the purge, which analysts describe as a bold but risky power play, Prince Mohammed has centralised power to a degree that is unprecedented in recent Saudi history.
Meanwhile,Saudi Arabia on Thursday urged its citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible, days after Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri announced his resignation while visiting the kingdom.
A foreign ministry source, quoted by state news agency SPA, also called on Saudis not to travel to Lebanon, but without specifying any threat.
Due to the situation in the Republic of Lebanon, the kingdom asks its nationals visiting or living in Lebanon to leave as soon as possible, and advises its citizens not to travel there, the source said.
On November 4, Hariri announced in a televised speech from Saudi Arabia that he was stepping down, citing Iran's grip on Lebanon and threats to his life.
The shock announcement raised fears that Lebanon -- split into rival camps led by Hariri and the Iranian-backed movement Hezbollah -- could once again descend into violence.
Hariri, who also holds Saudi nationality and whose wife and children live in the kingdom, has since met Saudi King Salman and travelled to the United Arab Emirates, according to official media in the Gulf states.
Lebanese President Michel Aoun has said he will await Hariri's return before taking any decision, while Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said Hariri's resignation had been imposed by Saudi Arabia.
The resignation coincided with the announcement in Saudi Arabia of an anti-corruption purge in which dozens of princes, ministers and businessmen have been rounded up.
Bahrain, a close ally of Saudi Arabia, advised its citizens against travel to Lebanon a day after Hariri's announcement. - AFP
