IT WAS A MIRACLE
THAILAND: It was meant to be a fun excursion after football practice, but it turned into a life-threatening, two-week ordeal for a group of youngsters trapped in a cave with rising waters and no apparent escape route.
When coach Ekkapol Chantawong led twelve members of his Wild Boar youth football team into the mouth of northern Thailands Tham Luang cave complex on June 23, he thought theyd be no more than an hour.
We didnt have anything with us, no food, he recalled at a press conference on Wednesday where the now world famous team recounted their harrowing ordeal and miraculous escape in their own words for the first time.
One of his pupils had a tutor class to get to later that evening. And besides, Ekkapol thought, the team often explored the complex after practice and knew its meandering tunnels well.
Thailands wet season was just around the corner -- a period of monsoonal downpours that often floods the cave -- and there were already pools of water inside the mouth.
A sign outside the cave warned against entry during the monsoon. But the kids were keen to have an adventure.
We were discussing whether we wanted to explore the cave and, if so, how we would have to swim, the 25-year-old coach, a much-loved mentor to the boys, recalled. It would be wet, it would be cold. Everybody said yes. The team, aged 11 to 16, left their bikes and football boots near the opening of the cave before one of the boys waded into the water. The rest followed. Had the heavens not opened, the Wild Boars would have been home by mid-afternoon. Instead a sudden deluge forced them deep inside the cave as floodwaters rushed through the entrance and steadily rose up the walls.
That fateful decision sparked one of the most remarkable, touch-and-go cave rescue operations in history.
It brought Thai Navy SEALs and international cave diving experts together to pull off the fiendishly difficult task of first locating the missing boys and then extracting them through miles of flooded passageways, as a breathless world looked on.
One former Thai Navy SEAL, Saman Kunan, died when his air ran out during a resupply mission.
Trapped in the dank, pitch-black darkness, the boys had no idea whether anyone was even coming for them -- let alone that they had generated non-stop global headlines.
I was really afraid that I wouldnt be able to return home, 13-year-old Mongkol Boonpiem, recalled.
Fortunately they had a fresh water supply.
We drank water that fell from the rocks, Pornchai Khamluang, the 16-year-old boy who first waded into the water, told reporters. It was clean and tasted like any drinking water. As the hours turned into days, the boys did what they could to keep their spirits up -- coach Ekkapol, who spent some years in a local monastery as a Buddhist monk, taught them how to meditate to keep calm and preserve air.
They had little concept of time but the first time they went to sleep they prayed, Ekkapol said. Calm camaraderie saw them through but there were moments of terror. The rising floodwaters kept pushing the group deeper into the cave.
At one point they started trying to dig their way out, a futile illustration of their desperation in a cave system buried under hundreds of metres of limestone.
We used rocks to dig out the cave wall, said Phanumas Saengdee, 13. We dug three to four metres.
Eventually the team settled on a small muddy ledge some four kilometres inside the cave, figuring all they could do was hope someone would find them.
Salvation came on day nine in what to the boys seemed like the most unlikely of forms. The team heard voices but the language they were speaking was not Thai.
Two British cave diving experts, who had spent days battling the flooded passages, had finally located the stranded group.
Adul Sam-on, 14, was the only member of the Wild Boars who could speak English.
When he (the diver) emerged from the water I was shocked that he was British, he recalled. It was a miracle, I was frightened and I asked him Can I help you In video of the scene that was captured by one of the divers bodycameras and later broadcast around the world, the bedraggled boys, dressed in mud-caked football kits, could be seen thanking their rescuers.
Many people are coming. Many, many people, the diver reassured the boys.
They were no longer lost or alone. The rescue mission was on.

Malaria mosquitoes on the rise in Akkaraipattu
Malaria mosquito numbers had been on the rise in the Akkaraipattu and Alayadivembu Divisional Secretariat divisions recently, Akkaraipattu Medical Officer of Health (MOH) Dr. Farooza Nackfer said.
According to Health Department officials, malaria mosquitoes had been discovered to have spread across a range spanning one kilometer away from the Sri Lanka Transport Boards Akkaraipattu depot office. Larvae of these mosquitoes had been recently discovered in wells, water tanks as well as buckets in the area.
The Kalmunai Malaria Control Division and public health inspectors attached to the Health Department, are currently taking measures to eradicate the mosquitoes. Sri Lanka had been declared to be free from malaria by the World Health Organisation in 2016. Malaria mosquitoes were discovered in Thalaimannar and later, in the Jaffna and Vavuniya districts as well during last year.

786.lk making e-Commerce accessible to SL industrial sector
A new entrant in the Sri Lankan e-Commerce space, 786.lk is making waves across the digital landscape as the countrys pioneering e-Commerce platform dedicated to industrial products and services.
With a soft launch in April this year, 786.lk has fast spread their wings to cover Sri Lankas industrial manufacturing segment - a market sector that lacked the serviceability and commercialization on existing e-Commerce platforms in the country.
786.lk was initiated as a groundbreaking platform for e-Commerce and supporting e-Logistics services for locally manufactured industrial products, and in three months on-boarded is leading Sri Lankan companies to include fast-moving sub-sectors such as solar components, electrical components, power tools and machinery on the platform.
The overarching objective of 786.lk is to take the Made in Sri Lanka label to the world through products that are not traded on other e-commerce platforms that were identified to be mainly industrial-based, and are looking to expand the platform across all verticals.
The exporting of the sold products falls under the companys e-Logisitics service offering that offers the most economical and ecofriendly export service for goods purchased via the 786.lk website. Additionally, the team at 786.lk are also offering a collaborative approach for vendors who are on-boarding the website on how to reach and target a wider export market.
The company is now looking to meet the demand of the rapidly growing local customer-base by creating an island wide agent network segregated to 3 areas covering the Western, Southern and Central regions of the country respectively. This will further consolidate the companys benchmarked standards in customer servicing, with guaranteed rapid response and delivery times as well as supportive and personalized customer support and consulting.
We are thrilled to see the enthusiasm shown by local suppliers and manufacturers of industrial goods who have finally found a digital solution that fits their marketing needs, stated Pubudu Thiloshana, Head of Operationsof 786.lk. Our main criteria when on-boarding vendors is high quality products traded at a very competitive rate.
Our own pricing model does not tax the supplier with a monthly fee, but is rather based on a percentage of the sales carried out within the month. This has been one of the most attractive offerings that has been successful with our potential vendor base.
The company has numerous more expansion strategies in store for the platform, and are encouraging small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) to also join the platform under the ApeyDeyak sub category, a service created by the company to empower local businesses to explore their customer base for consumer goods that are Made in Sri Lanka.

Aloysius and Palisena deprived of food, water
The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday expressed her dissatisfaction over an incident where Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena, who were remanded in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue, had not been served with food or water from last morning until evening.
It was revealed in court that the two suspects had not been provided with lunch, even though the case against them was taken up at 1.40 pm. The suspects had been brought to court yesterday morning.
Presidents Counsel Anil de Silva, appearing on behalf of the suspects, informed court that their clients were not provided with lunch even at 3.15 pm, yesterday.
They were brought before court in the morning. Breakfast was served at 6.00 am. No food or water were given thereafter, Presidents Counsel Silva said.
Taking into consideration the facts, the magistrate said that it was the duty of prison authorities to provide the necessary facilities to remand suspects in due time.
The magistrate further directed prison officials to arrange the necessary facilities in a proper manner to the remanded suspects, without depriving basic human requirements.
The two suspects, Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded until August 2 by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court. The court had issued a warrant against Arjuna Mahendran, the first suspect in the case, since he failed to comply with court orders.
On February 16, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne refused to release the two suspects on bail, citing that reasons given by the defence were not sufficient enough to consider releasing the suspects on bail under exceptional circumstances.
Filing a B report before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court regarding the Central Bank Bond issuance on February 27, 2015, the CID had named former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius, its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and the PTL as suspects in the case. The prosecution maintained that there had been a direct loss to the government following the issuance of bonds on February 27, 2015.
The prosecution said that Arjuna Mahendran could be charged with criminal breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and two others for aiding and abetting to commit the offence.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara, with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama, appeared on behalf of the Attorney-General.
Presidents Counsel Anil Silva, Kalinga Indatissa PC, counsels Jeewantha Jayatilleke and Sajith Jayawardena appeared on behalf of the suspects.

Archbishop of Colombo clarifies position on death penalty
Archbishop of Colombo, Malcom, Cardinal Ranjith yesterday issued a clarification on reports that he supported implementing the death penalty in Sri Lanka.
My point is that the state should not bring back the death sentence, but that criminal minds that seek to destroy social peace should not go unpunished for their criminal behaviour even after being condemned, he said.
Cardinal Ranjith blamed inaccurate translations from his original quotes in the Sinhala language to the English language, for misinterpretation in the media. The Holy Father Pope Francis has, in fact, not accepted the death penalty, which is also my own position invariably.
Following is the full text of his statement:
My attention has been drawn to reports and comments appearing in the print and social media concerning an interview I have given on the decision by the President and the Cabinet, to introduce a limited application of the death penalty to certain types of prisoners whose activities are detrimental to national security, safety and the concerns of the future generations.
Unfortunately, especially in the English language media, the interview given in the Sinhala language and which appeared in the Lankadeepa newspaper of July 13 has not been correctly studied and presented and thus the public seems to have thought that I am in favour of the death penalty in general.
What I stated on this matter if it is translated in English is as follows: It has been reported in the newspaper media that some of the prisoners condemned to death and presently residing in the prisons are organising activities of criminality from the prisons.
Then I said, We should condemn this kind of action as unacceptable. Here, there seems to be two questions that emerge. The first one concerns the whole complex of the prisons, the ministry and the officials in charge of the prisons. If all these institutions are fulfilling their responsibilities well, how could such activities originate from the prisons It was reported that once an underworld criminal condemned to the prison and taken there by the guards had been carried on the shoulders of the other prisoners in a kind of welcoming ceremony in the prison.
Who is authorising and giving them permission to do such things We express our surprise about such activities taking place in the prison.
How could such things happen where there are prison officials and those responsible for the administration I believe that an inquiry needs to be held and a proper reform of the prisons needs to be carried out. It is the responsibility of our political leadership.
We always treat with kindness our prisoners on the basis of our culture and this extends also to those condemned to capital punishment in Sri Lanka.
Capital punishment, though it exists in the Statute books, is not carried out in our country mainly because of our religious traditions. Our religions teach us that human life is a precious thing. For this reason, we can never agree to kill someone.
Yet, if there are prisoners who engage in drug importation and distribution or in the perpetration of violence through the underworld causing death to others, one needs to reconsider that practice and implement whatever punishment has been received by them through the Courts of Law.
It is a more complex question if all those who have received a death sentence should be executed. There should be a bigger discussion on that matter as such sentences may be flawed.
People in prison who engage in organising such crimes from the security of the prison, are doing a grave harm to society. They commit a grave sin. Thus there is nothing wrong in carrying out the punishment given to them by the Courts. Not all people fall into that special category.
They could be identified on the basis of only credible witnesses and solid facts. That is up to the justice system to do. Perpetrators of such gruesome crimes could be considered as having forfeited their own right to life. Because such activities cause death to other people.
The President has not expressed the idea of executing all those who are condemned to death.
We support the consideration he has shown towards the upholding of the rule of law. It is a way in which the violent activities of the underworld can be curtailed which the State is obliged to do. It is the misfortune of this country that such harmful activities continue to happen with impunity from the prisons. (Lankadeepa, July 13, 2018, p.14).
From the above it is clear that neither have I advocated a reintroduction of the death penalty carte blanche as people seems to have understood nor have I desired to close my eyes and do nothing before this terrible phenomenon our country is faced with at present which causes death and violence in the streets and the destruction of the cream of our youth who become drug addicts at an age as early as their adolescence, being exposed to drugs even in their schools. This is being done by drug cartels operated at times from the prisons. That was the concern and context of my statement.
Hundreds of parents have approached our clergy and expressed their horror at what happened to some of their children. Several cases of suicide by youth consuming drugs have been reported to us. The Archdiocese in fact organised two protest marches against drug peddlers in Ragama and in Negombo with thousands of our faithful participating and I have listened to the tearful tales of so many mothers whose families have been rendered destitute by the drug menace. Should we wash hands like Pilate and wait till our children are destroyed
The Holy Father Pope Francis has, in fact, not accepted the death penalty, which is also my own position invariably. I am not for a generalised return of capital punishment. It should be the last option, if at all.
In fact, the Catechism of the Catholic Church states, Assuming that the guilty partys identity and responsibility have been fully determined, the traditional teaching of the Church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only way of effectively defending human life against the unjust aggressor. (Catechism of the Catholic Church, revised edition, 1997 No. 2267).
Thus, I have acted on this matter with a sense of total awareness of the gravity of this situation, in faithfulness to what my faith teaches me on the matter and in consideration of the tragedy that continues to strike our youth and the nation and my responsibility before God and our people in addressing this serious national issue.
May I also refer to what Jesus, the Lord, mentioned with regard to those who cause scandal and mislead our children and youth in order to gain filthy lucre for themselves: It would be better for you, if a millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea than for you to cause one of these little ones to stumble (Lk.17:2).
My point is that the State should not bring back the death sentence, but that criminal minds that seek to destroy social peace and harm hundreds of others putting into ridicule law and order and challenging humanity to stop them if possible, should not go unpunished for their criminal behaviour even after being condemned. Our youth are too precious to be sacrificed on the altar of philosophical sophistry and arguments. It would be like Nero playing the fiddle while Rome burned.

Arjun Aloysius mobile used  to call criminals - AG
It has been revealed that Perpetual Treasuries Limited beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius phone found in the cell he is held, had been used to contact persons involved in various crimes.
The Attorney General yesterday informed the Colombo Fort Magistrate that analytical reports pertaining to telephone conversations had revealed that three mobile phones and five SIM cards found from the H-Ward cell at Welikada remand prison where Arjun Aloysius is held, had been used to contact persons involved in various crimes.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara appearing for the CID made these remarks before Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne as a part of magisterial inquiry into the controversial Central Bank bond issue. SDSG Jayasundara further told that the prosecution was yet to receive another analytical report pertaining to mobile phone conversations and necessary legal action will be taken accordingly.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney Generals Department complained that one of the mobile phones had been found between the pillow and the mattress given to Arjun Aloysius.

Australian govt. supports Eastern Province tourism diversification
Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson was the chief guest at the opening of the homestay business of tourism activity provider Safari Panama in Panama, a small town near Arugam Bay in the Eastern Province, on July 18.
Safari Panama is one of the few tourism operators in the area, having built up a reputation for wildlife safari (at Kumana National Park) and beach camping among tourists who are looking for something more than catching the waves. This, as well as the unique tourism model that Paname has developed  almost by accident  was identified as a potential change-maker by the Australian governments Market Development Facility (MDF) programme, which is working to diversify tourism in Sri Lanka.
Panamas fledgling tourism scene is capitalising on something visitors to Sri Lanka are now increasingly craving: authentic Sri Lankan experiences.
We have many homestays in Panama, explains Safari Panama owner and the chief entrepreneur of the areas tourism scene Priyantha Pushpakumara. Most of them are run by the women of the household, whose husbands work as day labourers and sometimes fishers. Tourists enjoy staying in these because they love the homely experience, and especially the home-cooked food.
The homestays add local flavour to a naturally appealing destination that is slowly gaining fame. Priyantha acts as tour guide cum travel agent for the Panama tourism scene, encouraging his wildlife and camping tourists to board at the homestays. Supported by MDF, Priyantha has been working to formalise his role, and at the opening ceremony signed agreements with seven women homestay owners who will be officially promoted by Safari Panama, with standardised rates and a more streamlined service offering. In addition, Safari Panama is creating a network of individual safari jeeps and trishaws to offer safe and reliable transport for tourists interested in visiting the beach or Kumana.
Speaking at the event, Hutchesson said: For Panama, this is an excellent way to join Sri Lankas growing tourism market, and for women a way to join an industry in which they often face many barriers to entry.
Tourism is notoriously low on women employment numbers, for a number of reasons including social perceptions relating to women working with foreign tourists and difficulties in managing household obligations with non-traditional work hours. Operating a homestay removes the mobility barrier, and having a group of women in the village running similar establishments has increased community buy-in in Panama, and reduced stigma.
MDF works in Sri Lanka to diversify the tourism offering. An important aspect of the model is to identify businesses like Priyanthas which are embedded into the community and have the potential to have a large impact on people who would not otherwise have the chance to connect with, or benefit from, tourism.

Bringing glass to life
Glass is like a woman; shes fragile and delicate, but she goes through great struggles and becomes stronger. The more stress you put her through, the stronger she gets; but push her beyond her breaking point and she will shatter beyond repair, just like glass! says US-based Hasna Sal.
It is only natural that Hasna links glass to a woman for it is a medium she is intimately acquainted with as much as she is with her own self.
Hasna is part of the rare breed of glass sculptors, who love to give their sculptures a voice and then let these seduce the senses of the onlookers. In her own words  her creations of glass are a cornucopia of planes, textures, tonalities, resonances, moods, emotions, morality, chaos, and more. And yes, her sculptures are also the voice of colour, which she believes is fundamental to the human spirit as it alleviates, invigorates and humanises. Born in the coastal district of Vypin in Kochi, it was her education in a Catholic school that exposed her to stained glass. A fascination took birth and never let go as she says, As a child, I used to stare in awe for hours and hours at the images in glass at the chapel. But the metal in the glass always bothered me; I felt like it was an aberration.
Her fascination with the medium of glass never went away and influenced her education. Hasna completed four years of fine arts from England and Wales and moved to the US to pursue an architectural degree from Boston, where her thesis was glass. She exclaims, By then I was totally in love with the material.
It was her post graduation at Harvard that had her dabbling in glass, which proved to be a life-changer. Glass, unlike any other medium, creates rich flowing compositions. She says, I made some things in glass for my fellow students and professors. When the Head of the Department saw my work, he said I should seriously consider doing this full-time because I had a rare and unique gift. This was the validation I needed; if the head of one of the greatest universities in the world thought I had it, then I must have it in me. That gave me the confidence and courage to start on my own, and I have never looked back since.
America has cutting-edge prowess in glass, which allowed her talent to bloom and flower. She adds, I have learned from 28 artists around the world and Im continuing to do so. America is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love the country for its innovativeness and opportunities.
Glass as a medium is not easy to work with as Hasna mentions, Glass is unpredictable. So many factors influence this material. Weather, climate, seasons, manufacturer, place of manufacture, soil, temperature gradient, heat shelf, the coefficient of expansion etc just to name a few. The more experienced you are, the better you can handle this liquid. And still, there are issues that pop up.
She laughs and says, The rule in the glass world is always keep a band-aid ready. Band-aid is my friend.
Hasna does myriad processes  glass-blowing, kiln-working, casting, silk screening, sandblasting, lampworking, etc. just to name a few. Her themes are mostly nature-based, inspired by the natural ethereal world and there is a reason for the influence.
I studied landscape architecture from Harvard, which taught me to see nature in a different light, she says, adding that she is also inspired by women, children and horses.
Talking about a proud moment she says, I got the Doge International Award in Venice for my presentation at the Biennale and it was one of the best moments of my life.

In order to do so they need to understand the budgeting process. For this reason, Acclivity Training considers knowledge of budgeting essential for any manager who needs to manage a budget.
A spokesman for Acclivity Training said that the seminar will focus on budgeting skills and the elements of a budget. Participants will learn budgeting concepts, how to assess revenue and costs, forecasting techniques and justification of expenditure. The contents will be illustrated by a case study.
Upendra Wijesinghe, a well known speaker in the accounting field will lead the seminar. Wijesinghe is currently the Chief Executive of Excellence Business School and Managing Partner of W&J Associates.

Calm, composed candidates less favoured in job interviews
People who appear calm and collected during a job interview may be at a disadvantage, according to a Stanford study which found that employers are more likely to favour excited candidates.
People's behaviour can be influenced by the emotional states they value and want to feel. It is how a person wants others to see them, even if they might not feel that way, like trying to appear at ease at a job interview. However, prior research studies show that emotions people value, and in turn display, vary across culture. These cultural differences may influence candidates and their hiring managers on job interviews.
"Given how diverse our workforce is and how global our markets are, it's important to understand how culture might influence emotional preferences in employment settings," said Jeanne Tsai from Stanford University in the US.
The researchers conducted five studies that included a total of 1,041 participants in five different workplace scenarios. In four of the studies, the scholars compared European Americans and Asian Americans living in the US with Chinese living in Hong Kong.
In one experiment, participants were asked to imagine they wanted a competitive internship. They were then asked to fill out an application, including a video introducing themselves. At the end of their application, they were asked which emotions they wanted to convey. The researchers found that what is interpreted as the "best impression" varies from person to person and from culture to culture.
In another study, the researchers presented employees at a US company with a similar scenario. They were shown video applications from three candidates who all had the same level of qualifications. However, one candidate was animated and excited, another calm and a third neutral.
Of the 300 participants, 47 per cent favoured the excited applicant, whereas only 23.7 per cent liked the calm candidate. About 29.3 per cent chose the neutral one. "In the US, career counsellors and job advisers often tell applicants to be excited and enthusiastic when applying for jobs," Bencharit said. "It is important to recognise that this message is shaped by our culture, and it may not be right or feel natural for everyone, " she said.

He further assured that these two gigantic projects would benefit nine million people in the country.
Undoubtedly everybody in the country would be very happy if it was implemented very soon. This Government is left with only 18 months. The Prime Minister is entrusted with a huge task of completing a massive project before the next general election.
It would ensure the public confidence in the government. The general public will be convinced that the government is capable of development. I fervently hope that the prime minister would be able to materialize his plan before the next election.

Cleantech conducts beach clean-up campaign on World Environment Day
Cleantech, the environmental management arm of the Abans Group, recently collaborated with the Institute of Environmental Professionals Sri Lanka (IEPSL) to conduct a beach clean-up campaign in honour of World Environment Day.
Having taken place in June, the event focused on raising awareness of marine pollution and its deleterious impact on Sri Lankas world-famous beaches.
A team comprising of Cleantech and IEPSL members as well as volunteers from the public descended upon the Wellawatte coastline to perform the large-scale beach clean-up. Armed with black garbage bags, each individual worked to clear the region of the waste that regularly washes up on the countrys shores. The initiative recovered tons of debris and castoff items, with plastics encompassing 31.4% of the total. Eighty percent of the plastics found were PET bottles. This gave Cleantech the opportunity to educate the participants on the proper disposal of household plastic waste, and present recycling as an easy solution to preventing further beach pollution. Speaking about their CSR initiative, H.S. Premachandra, IEPSL President, said, It was a nice collaboration. Professionals, service providers and regulators got together in front of so many beach users to give the important message that we should not pollute the environment. I deeply appreciate the excellent coordination and organizational support provided by Abans-Cleantech (Pvt) Ltd., who helped make this event a success. We take pride in the fact that Sri Lankas beautiful beaches are renowned across the globe. But do we do our part in keeping these beaches clean Thats why Cleantech felt the need to conduct this noteworthy initiative with IEPSL, and draw the publics attention to how we as a nation can prevent damage to our coastal environment by performing responsible plastic waste management, said Janaka Wijesekara, Head of Environmental Management, Cleantech (Pvt) Ltd.
Established by the Abans Group in 2002, Cleantech is the nations leading service provider of resources recovery including e-waste management, built-environment maintenance and sanitation facility services.
Currently, Cleantech offers a social base electronic waste collection programme in Sri Lanka that covers the major cities in the Colombo district with the collection and sortation facilities meeting or exceeding international quality standards.
The Company has BASEL clearance to export e-waste to the governments of Japan and Europe.
Cleantech operates a recycling facility at Kohilawatte, which specializes in the pre-processing of recoverable e-scrap while adding value to other reusable but less-in-demand materials.
Interested individuals and corporations who desire to effectively discard and recycle their waste can contact Cleantech for further assistance.

CRTA urges mechanism to address price dipping woes
The Colombo Rubber Traders Association (CRTA) stressed that the industry along with the government should come up with a proper mechanism to address the concerns of smallholders and plantation companies during times of rubber price decline to ensure sufficient supply to rubber products manufacturers.
CRTA Immediate Past Chairman Sunil Poholiyadde speaking at the CRTAs 99th Annual General Meeting (AGM), held at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Auditorium yesterday warned that many of the smallholders would cease their production or look for other lucrative employment opportunities if prices continue to drop.
The small holder sector currently accounts for almost 70 percent of the rubber production in Sri Lanka. He said in 2016, the rubber price hit a low of nearly Rs.200 a kilo from a price level of almost Rs.600 a kilo in 2013.
Commenting on the drastic drop in rubber production in Sri Lanka, Poholiyadde noted that a decade ago, Sri Lanka produced almost 150 million kilos of rubber, which came down to almost 60 million kilos in 2016. He attributed the lower production to reduced prices due to external reasons and adverse weather conditions and lack of available land for rubber cultivation.
Nevertheless, Sri Lankas rubber production has increased up to 85 million kilos in the recent past, indicating a marginal growth. However, it is only about a 40 million kilo increase compared to the last year, he said.
Poholiyadde also highlighted the importance of expanding rubber cultivation into non-traditional areas. He pointed out that acquisition and alienation of the rubber land for urbanization and other industries as the major issue for the drop in production.
Im informed that close to 4,000 hectares of rubber land of regional plantation companies have been identified for acquisition for various industrial purposes.For those lands to come to the current productivity level, it will take at least a minimum of 10 years.
Poholiyadde also mentioned that if objectives of Rubber Master Plan which was launched in 2006 to be achieved, a fair amount of production has to take place within the country even to attract or expand the current value addition.
Newly elected Chairman, of CRTA Amanda Weerasinghe speaking at the event urged the respective authorities to take these major issues into serious consideration and have a proper plan to move forward.
Every one of us doesnt realize the importance of rubber industry potential or this profession. Rubber plays a significant role in Sri Lankans lives and it is high time for us to get together and take immediate actions to address these issues rather than blaming each other, Weerasinghe noted.

## Title: DEMOCRACY AND CONSCIENCE OF PEOPLE AND LEADERS
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, July 20, 2018 - 01:00
DEMOCRACY AND CONSCIENCE OF PEOPLE AND LEADERS
The Sri Lankan people came to exercise a hitherto unexperienced process of universal franchise in 1931. People began to participate in the choice of those who were to represent them and look after their general well-being at local and national levels, culminating in electing the rulers of Independent Lanka in 1948 and thereafter every five years or so. Thus people began to elect and experience democratic governance through free elections before fairness was made to disappear and high-handedness and intimidation also appeared until the democratic hopes revived in January 2015. But now we are overshadowed again by bleak prospects.
Democratic rights of the people are prior to their being acknowledged or enshrined in Constitutions with the laws of democratic governance. Not only politicians, all peoples representatives, public servants should adhere to the fundamental principles of democracy, freedom and rule of law. When the people concede to them power to govern, judge, administer, many succumb to their character flaws, neglect their duty, surpass their authority and flout democratic principles without acting as servants of the people.
Democratic rights are not concessions of politicians, public servants or policemen to the people. They come from the natural law and moral law which are the sources of freedom, democracy and democratic principles. Freedom is not freedom to misbehave or misconduct, to act wickedly or cause injury but freedom to be creatively active within the moral law. All have the right to life from conception to natural death. Rights in a democracy have their source in human life; human dignity and rights which derive from natural law, the highest law, prior to Constitutions. The very basis of democracy is in human rights which are not arbitrary desires.
The centralization of authority, at a national summit, is for the common good and should not suffocate all activity of private initiative of resourceful individuals who enrich the whole of society. Those vested with authority should respect the principle of subsidiarity and let private initiative be free and when needed coordinate them towards better functioning. Authority should so order the common good according to a hierarchy of values and care for each one's autonomy and promote the freedom and security of all in the harmony of a society of equal persons endowed with human dignity and human rights, in justice, unity and peace. And when authority is not just, strong and steady, but fails, voices are raised recalling it to its obligations. Now it seems to be happening in an unacceptably incongruous strident manner.
PROFICIENCY OF STATE AGENCIES
The persons and organs of central and institutional authority have to operate in unity. They have to so organise and coordinate their activities so as to be constantly circumspective and watch over the legally proper and proportionate ordering of the multiplicity of needs and demands of a diversity of people coming under their range and cover. And the legislative, judicial and executive branches and under them the agencies of the state as well as private institutions sustained by peoples participation should function proficiently according to the law and not in an arbitrary manner, that the people may be contentedly served.
Arbitrariness, disorder, long neglect of proper functioning, deficiencies in transparency and accountability that lead to an inability to satisfy the just demands and needs of the people would tend to create displeasure, disappointment and chaos among them in addition to suspicion of corrupt management. Transactions among people and public and private organisations cannot take place without trust. Unfortunately, along with disregard of the law there an abuse of trust has begun to appear in spheres where big finances are concerned.
The top most institutional leader responsible is seen as incapable of justly handling a situation, is caught napping with the narrow selfish interests and feels trapped and unfree, entangled with shady deals and is indecisive in taking right action. Ministers even in Provinces and officials who are incompetent in just and fair management take arbitrary decisions and create disorder, unpleasantness and dissatisfaction causing also mayhem. This occurs today in Sri Lanka.
GOVERNANCE AND DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS
In the administration of ministries appointments are often done to give employment to the unemployed, to employ party loyalists or to re-employ the party loyalists who have been ousted by the outgoing ministers of the previous government, to accommodate the choice favourites of the minister in charge. The procedures of recruitment of teachers, for instance, seem ad hoc and arbitrary. The service of the people may need the qualified and professionally competent but this gets overlooked. Overlooked are also the well merited to get appropriate promotions.
Ministers in general who exercise arbitrary and inefficient control mistakenly think that they are managing well even while there is widespread disgust and dissatisfaction over their ways. In many ministries, mismanagement, lethargy, overspending, wasteful corrupt expenditure on duty-free luxury vehicles and corruption due to a multiplication of bureaucrats not only undermine efficiency, it undermines democracy, increasing the cost of administration thus burdening the people and increasing the cost of living, especially for the poor. Many try to either find fault with or justify the procedures adopted, as if their procedures alone ensure democratic rights. With disregard for the rule of law, democracy breaks down.
FAITH IN DEMOCRACY WOBBLES
Democracy is generally understood to be the prevalence of the will of the majority. However, the majority should also be concerned that democracy should pursue what is right and not what is wrong, what is moral and not what is immoral. Democracy does not mean carrying out the wishes of the majority even when the natural law and the moral law are ignored and people are denied human rights and their rightful belongings expropriated. What is against the natural law and the moral law and what is against human life, human dignity and human rights cannot be legalized by the will of the majority.
Party government and party leaders often ignore the conscientious views of their own party cadres as well as those of the minorities. This has happened in Sri Lanka from 1956 and after and polarized the people. Today we have come to a stage when whoever comes to power governs without giving much thought to the human dignity and rights of the people, presuming they have power over their life and death.
No economic plans are clearly presented to the people nor how the problems facing the country are going to be solved, in a way their cooperation could be obtained. Nutty opposition politicians keep dashing coconuts. Over these issues people are apprehensive.
It is always into an environment of confusion, disorder that tyrants have walked in through a democratic process, with populist backing, and taken hold of central authority like Hitler. He went on to usurp power to dominate and control people as a dictator and commit genocide in an unbelievable manner. When elected rulers descend to malignant wickedness and exercise power arbitrarily, peoples faith in democracy tends to wobble and crumble. At least some conscientious, even heroic, citizens should not let this happen in Sri Lanka. They should waken the consciences of the people, mobilize them and elect a government that will rule democratically and justly.

Department of Commerce to launch  Sri Lanka Trade Information Portal today
Sri Lanka will unveil one of the biggest initiatives in its international trade history when the Department of Commerce launches the World Bank supported Sri Lanka Trade Information Portal (SLTIP) today in Colombo.
SLTIP is to be unveiled by Minister of Industries and Commerce Rishard Bathiudeen, Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson, World Bank Senior Trade Specialist Marcus Bartley Johns and many top officials from the government. It is hosted by the Department of Commerce in collaboration with the National Trade Facilitation Committee, and developed with support from the World Bank and Australian High Commission in Sri Lanka.
World Bank supported Trade Information Portals (TIP) across the world provide information that traders need to import and export goods, including information on permits, laws and taxes. TIP provides the much needed transparency which leads to lower trade costs and improved predictability, and it is a key objective of international agreements like the World Trade Organizations Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA). The World Bank Group has supported TIPs in more than a dozen countries (Vietnam, was the last country to join, prior to Sri Lankas joining today) using a custom-built software platform.
The portal will improve the predictability and transparency of the countrys business environment, and provide foreign and domestic investors with quick and timely access to trade rules and regulations. For the first time, the portal puts in one place laws, regulations, procedures and other measures affecting trade maintained by forty-two government agencies, said DG Commerce Sonali Wijeratne.
The Sri Lanka Trade Information Portal aims to change the countrys business environment. With access to the right information at the right time, local businesses can confidently venture into international markets and help Sri Lankas economy realize a prosperous future, said Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson.
Trade is an important engine of growth for Sri Lanka and having fast and easy access to information on import and export procedures is crucial for traders and investors, said World Bank Senior Trade Specialist Marcus Bartley Johns. The portal is an essential piece of a larger, on-going effort by the government to enhance trade facilitation and attract foreign investments and the World Bank stands ready to continue to provide support to these important efforts.

## Title: Diabetes in cats

## Section: T&C
## Date: Friday, July 20, 2018 - 01:00
Diabetes in cats
Diabetes in cats is a complex disease caused by either a lack of the hormone insulin or an inadequate response to insulin. After a cat eats, her digestive system breaks food into various components, including glucose which is carried into her cells by insulin. When a cat does not produce insulin or cannot utilize it normally, her blood sugar levels elevate. The result is hyperglycemia, which, if left untreated, can cause many complicated health problems for a cat. It is important to understand that diabetes is considered a manageable disorder and many diabetic cats can lead happy, healthy lives.
Diabetes can be classified as:
Type I (lack of insulin production)
Type II (impaired insulin production along with an inadequate response to the hormone)
Cats with type II diabetes can progress to type I diabetes. In fact, by the time most cats are diagnosed with diabetes, they are identified as having the type I disorder. These cats require insulin therapy for survival. Cats with type II disease may respond to other forms of therapy.
Diabetes Symptoms in Cats
The following are signs that your cat may be diabetic:
Change in appetite (either increased or decreased), weight loss, excessive thirst/increase in water consumption, increased urination, urinating in areas other than litter box, unusually sweet-smelling breath, lethargy, dehydration, unkempt hair coat and urinary tract infection.
Causes of Diabetes
The exact cause of diabetes is unknown. Genetics, pancreatic disease, certain medications and abnormal protein deposits in the pancreas can play a role in causing this disorder. The most important factors in the development of diabetes seem to be obesity, gender (male cats are more commonly afflicted than females) and age.
Diagnosing Diabetes
To properly diagnose diabetes, your veterinarian will collect information about clinical signs, perform a physical examination and check blood work and urinalysis.
Treating Diabetes
Every diabetic cat is an individual and will respond differently to therapy. Diabetes treatment is based on how severe the signs of disease are and whether there are any other health issues that could complicate therapy.
Some cats are seriously ill when first diagnosed and require intensive hospitalized care for several days to regulate their blood sugar levels. Cats who are more stable when first diagnosed may respond to oral medication or a high-fiber diet. For most cats, insulin injections are necessary for adequate regulation of blood glucose. Once your pets individual insulin treatment is established, typically based on weight, you will be shown how to give him his insulin injections at home.
Your vet may also show you how to perform glucose tests at home. Other routine blood work may also be necessary. As your veterinarian will explain, its important to always give your cat insulin at the same time every day and feed her regular meals in conjunction with her medication; this allows increased nutrients in the blood to coincide with peak insulin level. This will lessen the chance that her sugar levels will swing either too high or too low. You can work with your vet to create a feeding schedule around your pets medication time. It is also important to avoid feeding your diabetic cat treats that are high in glucose.
Diabetes Prevention
A proper diet and regular exercise can go a long way to avoid the development of feline diabetes. Aside from other negative effects, obesity is known to contribute to insulin resistance.
If You Suspect Your Cat Has Diabetes
If your cat is showing any abnormal clinical signs as listed above, make an appointment to see your veterinarian immediately. If a diabetic cat is not treated, he can develop kidney disease, neurological disorders or other metabolic diseases. Cats with type I diabetes require insulin therapy for survival.

Emirates launches Facebook competition
Emirates, a global connector of people and their dreams, is offering Sri Lankans a chance to win two tickets to a destination in Europe via an exciting competition on Facebook.
The competition, which went live at midnight on July 18, on the Emirates Facebook page www.facebook.com/Emirates is open to Facebook users above the age of 21 in Sri Lanka. It closes at midnight on July28.
Tell us, in 50 words or less, what your dream Emirates destination is and why, and stand a chance to win two Economy Class return tickets to any one of our European destinations, the Emirates Facebook post invites.
Intended to generate wider awareness about the virtually unlimited travel options Emirates offers Sri Lankans by connecting the island to a global network of 155 destinations on six continents, the competition is aptly titled My Dream Emirates Destination.
Whether it is for pleasure or business, travel stimulates emotions, and destinations often come to represent memories or aspirations, said Chandana de Silva Emirates Area Manager for Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Certain destinations exert a pull that can only be satisfied by going there. This competition is inspired by the magic of travel, and Emirates ability to make travel dreams come true.
The fact that Emirates offers 155 destinations means that not only are we the best choice for Sri Lankans who wish to see the world, we offer destinations to suit every aspiration and budget, as well as the unbeatable experience of flying the worlds best airline including a chance to experience the iconic Emirates Airbus A380 when travelling beyond Dubai, Mr de Silva added.
Emirates commenced operations to Sri Lanka in April 1986. The Emirates Group employs more than 1,350 Sri Lankans who are an important segment of its multinational employee base, contributing to the success of the company in their diverse roles.
Emirates currently connects Sri Lanka to the world with 35 flights a week from Colombo 28 flights a week westward to the Maldives and Dubai and a daily flight eastward to Singapore.

EU signs its biggest free trade deal with Japan
The European Union and Japan have signed one of the worlds biggest free trade deals, covering nearly a third of the worlds GDP and 600 million people. One of the biggest EU exports to Japan is dairy goods, while cars are one of Japans biggest exports.
The move contrasts sharply with actions by the US Trump administration, which has introduced steep import tariffs. EU Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said the deal underlined the win-win solutions offered by free trade.
Juncker said, The impact of todays agreement goes far beyond our shores. Together we are a making, by signing this agreement, a statement about the future of free and fair trade.
We are showing that we are stronger and better off when we work together. And we are leading by example, showing that trade is about more than tariffs and barriers. It is about values, principles and finding win-win solutions for all those concerned. The US was in talks with Japan and other Asian countries 18 months ago about a wide-ranging free-trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific trade agreement, but Donald Trump withdrew from this in one of his first moves after becoming president.

FB to remove misinformation that could spark violence
Facebook, facing growing criticism for posts that have incited violence in countries including Sri Lanka, has said that it would begin removing misinformation that could lead to people being physically harmed.
The policy expands Facebooks rules about what type of false information it would remove, and comes largely in response to instances in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and India, in which rumours spread on Facebook led to real-world attacks.
The new rules do not apply to Facebooks other big social media properties; Instagram and WhatsApp.
We have identified that there is a type of misinformation that is shared in certain countries that can incite underlying tensions and lead to physical harm offline. We have a broader responsibility to not just reduce that type of content, but remove it, Tessa Lyons, a Facebook product manager, said.
Facebook has been criticised over the way its platform had been used to spread hate speech and false information that led to violence. The company had struggled to balance its belief in free speech with those concerns, particularly in countries where access to the internet was relatively new and mainstream news sources that would counter social media rumours are limited.
In Myanmar, Facebook had been accused by United Nations investigators and human rights groups, of facilitating violence against Rohingya Muslims, a minority ethnic group, by allowing anti-Muslim hate speech and false news.
In Sri Lanka, riots broke out after false news pitted the countrys majority Buddhist community against Muslims. Near-identical social media rumours had also led to attacks in India and Mexico. In many cases, the rumours included no call for violence, but amplified underlying tensions.
In an interview published by the technology news site Recode, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg attempted to explain how the company was trying to differentiate between offensive speechthe example he used was people who deny the Holocaustand false posts that could lead to physical harm.
I think that there is a terrible situation where theres underlying sectarian violence and intention. It is clearly the responsibility of all of the players who were involved there, Zuckerberg said.
While the social media company already has rules in place in which a direct threat of violence or hate speech is removed, it has been hesitant to remove rumours that do not directly violate its content policies.
Under the new rules, Facebook had said it would create partnerships with local civil society groups, to identify misinformation for removal. The new rules are already being put in effect in Sri Lanka, and Lyons said the company hopes to soon introduce them in Myanmar, before expanding elsewhere.

Focus more on science education  - Minister Dr. Amunugama
Sri Lanka has not given sufficient emphasis to science education, said Minister of Science, Technology Research, and Skills Development and Kandyan Heritage, Dr Sarath Amunugama.
We have about 10,000 schools in all, but science is taught only in about 1,000 he said addressing the World Youth Skills Development Day, Celebration program.
He added that Sri Lanka could be developed by creating a science culture and also skill development of young people. Without such skills we cannot create either an agriculturally or industrially advanced country.
He said that through the NVQ system there is an alternative to the traditional system of education. As someone who had followed the traditional system of higher education NVQ system is as good as that system. We cannot develop this county without both.
We must develop this NVQ system of training and education. We must optimize the resources committed to it, whether they are financial resources or resources of other kinds, like teachers. As a developing country we cannot afford to waste resources.
Sri Lanka must make available a training in skills that is required by the world of work. We have the IT field, building construction field, tourism and hospitality also the field of health care. There are many such fields from which there is demand for well trained manpower.
Minister said that there are 200,000 vacancies in the industrial sector and another 200,000 in the tourism sector.
Sri Lanka cannot provide the personnel required, due to deficiencies in our education. We have not paid attention to the teaching of foreign languages. Therefore the prospective investors go to countries like the Philippines and Sri Lanka adds foreign language teaching to our curricula.
When this is done, in the next 5 to 6 years you will be able to find good employment not only in this country but in countries like Japan, China and Europe as well.
I intend to start a Job Bank  a job fair, from next week. We will place the data concerning all the students passing out of our institutions, in a computer data base. Then we will be able to give to prospective employers all your particulars immediately. Any prospective employer will be able to recruit the skilled personnel he needs through our Job Bank.

Aluthge said no response had been received from any of those four persons on the ten demands presented by the GMOA in several occasions in the past.
The demands were submitted in writing on several occasions but no response yet.
The reasons for launching the strike are not updating DAT allowance as promised, not issuing the gazette notification on the minimum standards of medical education recommended by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), not responding to the proposals presented by doctors in connection with amending tax policy, violating the National Wages Policy are some of them, he said.
Signing Singapore FTA putting the local job market in a grave danger, purposely delaying holding election for the four vacancies in the SLMC and interrupting SLMC's functions, not solving grade promotions issues of doctors, not granting schools for doctors' children and intervening in appointments and transfers in the medical administrative service overlooking Public Service Commission and ignoring relevant rules and regulations etc. are the other reasons, he added.

Govt. spends unprecedented sums for farmer welfare: Minister Amaraweera
The colossal funds allocated by the government for the agricultural section for farmer welfare is unprecedented in the history of this country. No other government in recent history has done so much of work for the welfare of farmers, said Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
The minister was addressing a meeting at Mahawela in Jandura to mark the launch of a development project under the Gam Dahasak Wew Dahasak (Thousand villages and thousand tanks) programme in the Ambalantota DS division, recently.
The minister said his ministry had set apart Rs. 5,228 million towards the crop insurance scheme. Under this scheme, Rs. 100,000 per hectare would be paid in the event of damage to paddy, maize, B onion, Soya bean or green chili cultivation.
This had induced farmers to take up agricultural cultivation without second thoughts. All agricultural tanks in the country would be renovated by next year. Rs. 9,000 million had been set apart for tank rehabilitation.
Minister Amaraweera said steps should be taken to provide toxin-free food for the younger generation. Every inch of arable land available should be cultivated in a village to achieve development.
The government which had the interest of farmers at heart, paid Rs. 38,000 million as drought relief to farmers notwithstanding its financial difficulties.
Minister Amaraweera said the immense development work undertaken by the government did not get sufficient publicity in the media, adding that the manner in which some sections of the media highlighted killings and other crimes, made people believe that crimes had escalated under the present government. This was a travesty of the truth because there had been a drastic reduction in the rate of crimes after the present government assumed office.
This was largely due to the restoration of law and order in the country. Although the Agriculture Ministry had a surfeit of officers, the country produced only 11,200 metric tons of fruits annually, whereas fruit imports amounted to 44,000 metric tons annually.
This was highly regrettable, he said. Although a persons should consume 200 grammes of fruits daily, an average person consumed only about 95 grammes and that was also imported fruit and this was not satisfactory.

Women need an invitation and a place at the table Meghan Markle
The City of Love. The City of Peace. City of Order. The City of Justice. We all need it. We cant live without it. In other words, we need to create Women Friendly Cities. This is why the World University Service of Canada (WUSC) has invited a non-profit organisation  Stand by Me to join them in the initiative to promote the idea of Women Friendly Cities. A city where a woman can feel safe and secure and a city where she can contribute to the betterment of society without hindrance. Daily News attended this Women Friendly City conference co-hosted by the National Chamber of Commerce and learnt about the exciting plans in store for all women and girls.
The strength of a woman cannot be underestimated. They have become too inactive. Women have been sleeping for too long. It is time for them to wake up and make an impact on society and fulfil their potential. It is time for women to take an active interest in politics and play their part in the governance of this country. President National Chamber of Commerce Sujeeve Samaraweera, in his address, pointed out that woman leaders have been dormant for a long time. Men can help. But women should have a desire to work for their betterment too. Women need to have that willingness to improve their lot in life. She needs to have aspirations of her own. She needs to realize her uniqueness. She needs to understand that she has the capability to be resourceful.
What have our female leaders been doing What have they done since the time when Sirimavo Bandaranaike became the first woman prime minister in the world That achievement was a long time ago. Since then what have our women been doing There is very little female representation in parliament and in politics. So this is the type of event that the National Chamber of Commerce is proud to be a part of. Because we are giving women a place in our country where they can lead productive lives. There is much discrimination against women in this country and women face a lot of challenges. Now is the time to create women-friendly cities where women can feel safe and secure, said Samaraweera.
Sensitive towards women
A man can be a feminist too. If we are to change the way women are perceived and regarded then we need men on the side of women. A woman is a mother, she is a sister, she is a friend and she is a wife. She needs to be emancipated. She needs a place at the table when it comes to decision making. Strategic Advisor WUSC, Celene Fung, stressed that cities throughout the world should be female friendly. This is vital for womens rights.
There is a call for action. There needs to be a sustainable change for women. Cities should be sensitive towards women. There is a reason to improve human rights for women. We need to look at the community in a broader perspective. Even men should be included in this initiative. We need to improve the quality of life for women. Women need to feel secure in their homes and in their workplaces and on the streets. This initiative must be taken up by everyone in Sri Lanka because we have a duty and responsibility towards our women, said Fung.
Fung also emphasized that the more people raise a voice, the more the community will improve. There are no results like instant noodles. Progress will take time. We cannot have overnight results. Rome was not built in a day. Progress at times will be very slow, yet we have to keep on trying for the sake of our women. There will be times when we will feel frustrated. But we need to believe that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. We need to persevere when it comes to womens rights. We can never give up because then we let everyone down.
People should be motivated and excited when it comes to womens rights. Progress will take time but we need to start this sustainable change. We need to inspire women to take up this cause. We need to create networks, stated Fung.
Rape and sexual abuse is a heinous crime. Because of this, female victims go into their shell. Sometimes they never fully come out of it. The victim is made to think that she is at fault when the truth is that a woman is never at fault. She did not ask to be raped. She did not deserve what happened to her. A rapist is a very sick person who does what he does, for pleasure and mostly to feel powerful. We need to start with boys, because if we can get through to boys then we have won half the battle. We know that boys even bully girls to win the approval of their fellow male peers and superiors. They think it makes them a man. The truth is there is nothing manly about humiliating a girl.
Formerly from the Directorate of Internal Intelligence, Vocational Training Authority and National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority, Dr. Ajith Colonne, pointed out that it is imperative that young boys are taught not to objectify women. He outlined a case where a woman was raped by the friend of her husband. Then he blackmailed her by trying to get her to participate again.
There has to be a mechanism to ensure confidentiality when it comes to blackmail and cases of sexual abuse. Prevention is better than cure. Some women are victims of circumstances. Because once you lodge an entry at the police it goes into the media. Then the womans reputation goes down the drain and then her familys name also becomes tarnished. The same thing happens when she goes to the courts. She has to relive that mental agony. However, if we can have a mechanism of confidentiality where the perpetrator is severely warned of the consequences if he should commit the offence again, we might see a difference. We also need to look at our schooling system, where boys need to look at girls with respect, the way they respect their own sisters, said Dr. Colonne.
Raise awareness
President of Institute of Town Planners Archt. Piyal Silva, correctly pointed out that 52 per cent of the population in Sri Lanka are women, stating that changes have to be made in our society for their well-being. Just imagine how we can change this county if we can harness the potential of this 52 per cent. Now that would be real power. We can touch this country, we can create a force for good. We can make a difference in so many lives, he said.
It is encouraging that women are now getting into technical activities. More and more women are now coming into engineering. We need to create public places with sensitivity. We need to increase that feeling of security. This is where we come in as we implement urban designing. Attitudes have to change and respect has to come from the heart. We need to raise awareness, he added.
Women are actually multi-talented. They are naturally versatile and they are naturally adept at handling a variety of issues. We need to raise awareness that women have a mind of their own. They have a personality of their own. They are mothers and they have sons and daughters. It is important for women to realize that men can support their cause, but they need to meet men halfway.
Building Economics and Chartered Architect and Quantity Surveyor Prof. Chitra Weddikkara pointed out that even though there are not many women in construction sector, they are successful in soft trades. If you take soft trades like painting, tiling, and plumbing, women are very successful in these trades. They are well paid and they have a good life. But a women-friendly society needs to start at home. Women are remarkably multi-skilled. She manages the household and she does a job as well. Awareness is the key to creating women-friendly cities, stated Weddikkara.
Apparently, the hospitality industry is a safe zone for girls with a lot of scope for improvement. There seems to be the very little hindrance. There are a lot of smart young women in places of influence. The atmosphere is favourable and helpful. Hotels like Hilton, Ramada, the Cinnamon chain and other hotels like the Taj Samudra have a strong representation of women in their hierarchy. Board Member of the Hotels Association Sri Lanka, Nirmo Thambapillai, said that the hospitality industry welcomes women.
Girls are now thriving in this sector. There are so many avenues for self development in the industry. There is no glass ceiling. They are secure and there is no harassment in this sector. There are ladies in high places in the hospitality industry. Our staff is very supportive of these young girls, said Thambapillai.
There is a need to change the perception in society towards women. We know that girls get teased on the bus by some males. We have heard stories where trishaw drivers are rude and try to bully women when they inquire about the meter. A woman faces harassment on the roads, especially if she is westernized. She gets comments about her attire. This is, of course, ridiculous since a woman has the right to wear what she wants. It is her choice. Men who make vulgar comments about women based on what she is wearing cannot be called men at all. Recently there was an incident when an Indian woman was harassed in a plane by a fellow male passenger. Apparently, even planes are now unsafe for women. Girls especially suffer a lot, since this kind of bullying on the streets harms their self- esteem, especially when they are too young to realize that it is not their fault. They grow up believing that there is something wrong with them and that they are to blame. Bullying can kill and that is the truth.
Social Activist, Co-founder of Stand By Me, Elma Iqbal, said that female prisoner also is humans and that they face many issues, like sexual abuse and separation from their children.
The importance of women cannot be emphasized enough. They are part of Gods beautiful creation. Stand by Me is an organisation that stands for the rights of not only women but also men and animals. It stands for the rights of all living beings. A woman needs to fight for her rights. Do not let the perpetrator get away. We need to give women a voice. Take it to the boys school and educate them on womens rights, said Iqbal.

Inspirational interior
Pendi is an interior design based consultancy that stands for authenticity and uniqueness. Their home ware solution is designed and made locally in collaboration with a group of young designers. They are a group of people who are passionate about what they are doing. Daily News spoke to the founder of Pendi, Natalie Pendigrast who believes in creativity and thinking out of a box, so that each time a customer visits Pendi he or she can see something different.
The reason I started Pendi was because I was looking for a creative outlet of my own. My background is in interior design, which I have been doing for the last 10  12 years. I understood there was a gap in the market for lamps. When my husband and I got married, I had some of my lamp designs made for our house and people liked it and they asked me to make lamps for their houses as well. The response was good, and what started off as a hobby turned into a full time business. Our collection has grown from lamps into a complete home ware range, said Pendigrast.
Pendigrast soon found a following of designers who saw potential in her business and found it exciting.
Since my background and experience had been in interior design it made sense to go into a business that was related to my profession. So that is how the lamp side of it came about. I found a craftsman who could produce my designs and while working on my collection of lamp designs, I met other designers who were excited about what I was doing. They were excited by the concept of Pendi and wanted to contribute and get their designs made, stated Pendigrast.
That is how the initiative has now been built into a whole home ware range. The idea was to have a home ware store with a group of different designers, turning out their designs using the skills of the local craftsmen.
All of our products are locally made. So from lamps, now it has grown into a whole home ware collection. There are actually two parts to Pendis  the interior design services plus the home ware collection, said Pendigrast.
As an interior designer I have worked on many different types of projects. I worked for quite some time under an architect as the Head of his interior design team and set up Pendi together with my own interior design practice recently. Pendi is currently working on some residential, commercial and leisure projects said Pendigrast.
At Pendi everyone anticipates tomorrow. They are a group of people who enjoy what they are doing. It is not a job. It is a calling.
I am quite passionate about what I do here and what we all do together. It is a job I really enjoy and love. Throughout the time I was a student and intern I have done a lot of different types of jobs like administration, shipping, marketing and advertising. But the interior design field and home ware collection is something I feel that really pushes me. It pushes me to think out of the box, be creative and use my brain and come up with creative solutions. If interior designing is something that you really love to do, then go for it. Whatever career you want to have you need to love what you are doing! If you love what you do you can always face tomorrow, explains Pendigrast.
The vision of Pendi is to do something unique and something different to what is available in other home ware shops locally.
It should be something that is authentic and reflects our Sri Lankan lifestyle. We live in a tropical island and our lifestyle is quite unique. It is very different to what you would get in anywhere else. I like to think we focus on doing what reflects our lifestyle and our way of life, pointed out Pendigrast.
What Pendigrast is doing is commendable because not does it simply benefit Pendi and its Customers, it benefits the local craftsmen. Everyone wins.
We try to take advantage of materials and items that are locally found and things that have been used overtime in Sri Lanka, that Sri Lanka has come to be known for like the Batik and Cane weaving, woodwork and cement. We think on how can we use them in contemporary interior solutions We have taken the old traditional craft of Batik, and think, how can we use this in a new way, added Pendigrast.
There is no point going to a shop if you see the same old thing over and over again. The secret of the brand of interior designing that Pendi does it there is the element of discovery. You find something exciting and challenging every time you visit.
Experimentation in my field is very important. If we do not experiment we will never have something new. We will be doing the same thing over and over again. And that is against Pendis philosophy. The whole point in this shop is that there are a group of designers and each designer has their own distinct style. And when you come into the shop what you see is part of a limited collection. So we make small quantities. So hopefully the next time you come in we will have a different collection. We are always trying to give you something new. So if we do not experiment what is the point in you coming to Pendi when you see the same collection over and over again Plus it is really fun experimenting!, said Pendigrast.
At Pendi they pay a lot of attention to the smallest detail, because as Pendigrast points out, it has contributes towards the final product.
I think the smallest details are very important, because at the end of the day all the small things come together to form the bigger picture. If you dont pay attention to the small thing and if it is a bit untidy and careless, it affects the outcome at the end. So it is very important to think about the small things, said Pendigrast.
Pendi relies on good relationships. Pendi relies on dedication and commitment.
Pendi is something that is very personal to us and we hope Pendi will become a household name. Something people will appreciate and love. We invite our customers to come in and have a chat with us and we would like to have a good relationship with our clients. Not just clients or customers, our studio is open to other designers to walk in and talk to us too. I like to help young designers by sharing contacts and by sharing tips or hints. Anyway I can support them even by working on a collection with them. Just share what I have learnt along the way with them, pointed out Pendigrast.
The craftsmen are motivated and excited to try new designs and they have so much to bring to the table because they have been working in their trade for years. They have a lot to contribute with their ideas and are involved in the whole process with their creativity coming out as well.
Sri Lankans are generally quite laid back and relaxed. So we have to stick to deadlines and we have to travel out of Colombo, spending a couple of hours on the road, and going back and forth a few times with the suppliers before the final product is displayed in the shop. So definitely it is not easy and it is challenging. But I am very proud of it, because there is so much we can do with the craftsmen and the designers. Sri Lanka has so much talent. There is so much potential. It is the backbone of Pendi and what Pendi stands for, explained Pendigrast.
Pendigrast has a strong support system and they are also as talented as her and innovative. It is very much a family business built on trust.
I have a really good support group. I have incredible people who work with me and who are excited about Pendi as I am. My husband and family support me with the whole process and without that help I dont think I would be able to do this. Anukshi my partner, an interior designer herself helps me with the projects. She is a huge support to me because she helps overlook the home ware collection, dealing with all of the designers and craftsmen who help us make all the designs. There is Ena who is another designer who has been with me since day one, from the time I started lamps. She is a product designer by profession and she was happy to have an outlet to show off her designs and her skills. Her unending support and help, not just with her own designs but also with Pendi itself, makes her an integral part of our design family, she said.
Tamara is an artist and also our studio manager, holding down the fort and coordinating with all the designers, suppliers and customers. She helps me stay sane and again, a valued part of the Pendi family. I work here from Monday to Friday and Saturday and Sunday I go to the workshops and check on orders and keep the relationships going with suppliers and craftsmen. It is important to meet face to face with them, explained Pendigrast.
At Pendi you get batik upholstery, a coffee table with Batik in it, batik lamps, cement lamps, cement pots, batik pillowcases, batik table-runners, mats, baskets and rugs. The idea is to push the boundaries of creativity.
All our designers are freelance designers and there are around 12 or 15. Each designer has their own specialty and we give each designer their own recognition all labeled which each designers logo. They all work on their own they do not work for Pendi, but they do a collection exclusively for us which we retail here. We also work with a group, Semmen, that uplifts and encourages women in the north and north east. Inadvertently, the Pendi Design Family has evolved into a group of about 90 per cent women who all support and encourage each other with each of their businesses said Pendigrast.

Jelly nails are the big new summer beauty trend
There's a wonderful feeling that comes after getting your nails done. Not only have you just been pampered, but you look fabulous - and you know it.
But when it comes to manicure trends of late, we've certainly had some weird ones and they just weren't worth it. From miniature combs you could brush your hair with, to nails that looked like teeth. It seems people will quite literally put anything on their finger nails.
But finally there's a new trend that we're a little more willing to get on board with.
And it looks set to be a big beauty hit this summer. We're talking of course about jelly nails.
The bright, eye-catching look has become a big hit on Instagram, with many people opting to try the style in neon hues.Similar to the jelly shoes and jelly backpacks that were popular with youngsters in the 1990s, the jelly nails are slightly transparent.
They're also known as 'glass nails' because of the transparency.
The jelly nails are being done in all shapes and sizes, with some going all out to have long pointed claws and others opting for a more sleek, square look.
To get the look for yourself simply ask your nail technician to add a clear tip to your nails or use clear gel to sculpt the extension. But be warned that not every salon may stock the right tools or gels needed to recreate the cool manicure.
Some people have also been adding stickers and glitter to their jelly manicures to create interesting effects. People on social media are big fans of the look, with more than 3,500 posts cropping up under the jelly nails hashtag.

Job bank for youth soon - Minister
Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said he intends to start a job bank for youth  a job fair, from next week.
We will place the data concerning all the students passing out of our institutions in a computer data base, he said. Then we will be able to give to prospective employers these particulars immediately. Any prospective employer will be able to recruit the skilled personnel they need through our job bank.
The minister was speaking at celebrations to mark World Youth Skills Development Day, at the BMICH on July 17. The ceremony was attended by officials of both the state sector and the non-state sector and a large number of students.
The minister said this day was named by the United Nations, on a proposal made by Sri Lanka, and is celebrated by all member nations of the UN. This years theme was Sustainable development through youth skills and innovation.
The minister pledged to create an environment that will eliminate the gap between training and the employment.
The most important challenge is to ensure for our young people the jobs they are entitled to, Dr. Amunugama said.
Our system of education is not one oriented towards employment. The future of this country lies in creating a science-oriented culture. If a skills-oriented culture is not created, we cannot create a culture oriented towards economic progress in this country.
There are two lakhs of vacancies in the industrial sector and another two lakhs in the tourism sector. Many prospective investors come to set up IT centres here. However, we cannot provide the personnel required, due to deficiencies in our education. We have not paid attention to the teaching of foreign languages.
Therefore the prospective investors go to countries like the Philippines. If we add foreign language teaching to our curricula, in the next five to six years, you will be able to find good employment, not only in this country but in countries like Japan, China and Europe as well.
We must give you such an education. That is our duty. So we will give you the subject knowledge, language knowledge and IT knowledge. We will give you all three.

Second Test starts at SSC today:
Lanka should not lower their guard
Winning the first Test of a series and going one-up is what every nation strives for. But having achieved that and to lose the advantage of it is unpardonable. This is what Sri Lanka must guard against for in recent times they have this unusual habit of winning the first Test at Galle and then conceding the second Test to the opposition.
There have been numerous occasions where it has happened at home to Sri Lanka  since the turn of the century on eight occasions - the last being against Bangladesh in 2017 where they won at Galle but lost the second at the P Sara Oval to suffer their maiden Test defeat against that nation.
Since 2010 they have suffered similar losses to India (twice), England and New Zealand and the hoodoo ground for the second Test has been the P Sara Oval.
If you take the New Zealand game, we won in Galle and lost at P. Sara the same thing with England. We need to adapt to conditions true, but this is a different venue. Our preparation has been great and I am pretty sure the boys will deliver, said veteran spinner Rangana Herath looking ahead at the second Test against South Africa starting at the SSC grounds today.
At any cost we have to remember that South Africa are a very dangerous side. They will bounce back I am sure. But we have a bit of different plans and I am sure they will also have different plans. Our preparations have been great, he said.
Despite being suspended from the two Tests against South Africa it has not stopped captain Dinesh Chandimal and coach Chandika Hathurusingha from coming and assisting the team in its preparations.
True that we dont have a captain or coach for the game, but if you see at the nets, both Hathu and Chandi were there and the preparation was good. Without them we cannot go that far. Only during the game they are not there, but they are behind us, said Herath.
Sri Lanka has not won a series against South Africa since 2006 and the current two-Test series gives them the best opportunity to do so again having taken a 1-0 lead with a comprehensive 258-run win at Galle in the first Test.
It is very important that we win the series. They are the number two ranked team. We need to win and gain confidence and this is going to be a crucial game, said Herath.
Firstly, when you win the mentality is good. All the players are contributing. Suranga Lakmal, Dilruwan Perera and Dimuth (Karunaratne) were our key players in Galle. I am sure we will go from strength to strength.
Dimuths one hundred and fifty were remarkable. He set up the game and set a fine example. We have got to learn from him. Have a chat to him and find out what worked for him. Pretty pleased with the way he played, Herath said.
The SSC track is generally renowned to assist fast bowlers in the initial stages and turn out to be a batting paradise before helping the spinners by the end of the fourth day or so.
But in this instance with South Africa possessing arguably the best fast bowling attack in contemporary cricket in the likes of Rabada, Steyn, Philander and Ngidi the pitch in preparation will be considerably slowed down and made as dry as ever to assist Sri Lankas three-pronged spin attack of Herath, Dilruwan Perera and Sandakan that ran circles around the South African batsmen to condemn them to defeat inside three days.

Lankan banks should maintain  minimum NPL - expert
Sri Lankan banks should maintain minimum non performing loans (NPL), Partner, an Irish financial expert said in Colombo last week.
Partner BDO Ireland, Brian Mcenery said that the non performing loans which were accumulated by the housing segment was the main reason for the Irish financial crisis in 2008 which even led to the collapse of the oldest bank in the World, Monte Dei Paschi Di Siena of Venice, Veneto Bank, Irish Bank and Lehman. He said that banks started lending at attractive rates and even the Real Estate agents offered property at very low rate.
The then government also has a tax of 9% for each time a property was exchanged as they found that it was an easy way to collect revenue from this property boom.
Even the then prime Minister of Ireland who then had to exit said that there was no housing bubble which prompted more buying. In addition banks incentives to borrow for housing, regulatory risk relaxation also aggravated the situation. He was delivering a presentation at a breakfast meeting on Good Banking, bad Banks, non-performing loans  Ireland Experience hosted jointly by ICC Sri Lanka and BDO cordially invite at Kingsbury Colombo.
He said when the crisis came up it was estimated that cost of bank recovery was over 70 billion pounds and people even had to part with their private helicopters, Lamborghini cars and items such as diamond necklaces to bail them out.
He said that due to the crisis the Irish banks NPL which was at .6% in 2007 increased to 1.9% to 2008, 9.7% to 2009, 13% in 2010, 16% in 2011, 25% in 2012 and to 26% to 2013.
He said that regulators even should look at NPL of banks more carefully to avoid a repeat of this crisis in other countries. (SS)

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday issued a media release to clarify a statement attributed to him, via a forged document, purporting to be a media release from his office.
He said that a forged document purporting to be a media release issued by his office was in circulation in the social media on Wednesday.
This forged media release stated that the former President has officially selected the former defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to be the next Presidential candidate in 2020.
While refuting the allegation, he stated that he has not yet named the next Presidential candidate of the SLPP and it will only be done by him personally at a public gathering.
We wish to inform the public that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has not yet named the next Presidential candidate of the SLPP. This forged media release has been planted in the social media after the former President left for Singapore. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa wishes to state that when he names the next presidential candidate of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and the Joint Opposition, it will not be through a media release but will be done personally by him at a public gathering, the clarification said.
Meanwhile, former defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in statement posted on his official Facebook page said a fake media release circulating in social media, purported to be from former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, claiming to have appointed him as the Presidential candidate for 2020, is totally inaccurate and is an attempt by certain parties to mislead and confuse the people and political stakeholders.

National Export Strategy to transform trade landscape; achieve $ 28 bn in exports by 2022
Sri Lanka unveils the National Export Strategy (2018-2022) which will boost the countrys entrepreneurs capabilities to take advantage of opportunities in global markets.
While exports in 2017 were the highest on record, Sri Lanka has a long way to go to catch up with its Asian peers.
The five-year National Export Strategy (NES) will help to make Sri Lanka a major regional export hub, Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Speaking at the launch of the National Export Strategy at Temple Trees he said that Sri Lanka hopes to earn a US$ 28 billion export revenue by 2022 with the launch of this programme.
NES is a blueprint for achieving increased exports, enhanced regional cooperation and job creation. Technical assistance for developing the NES was provided through the EU-Sri Lanka Trade Related Assistance project funded by the European Union.
The Strategy sets out specific priority actions and investments to address competitiveness constraints, modernise regulatory systems for improved efficiency, and boost Sri Lankan industries in order to increase exports. It also sets targets to improve opportunities for Sri Lankas micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and exporters in regional and global trade.
Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama said, The NES further strengthens our ongoing shift in the economic growth model from one that was heavily dependent on debt-fuelled public infrastructure spending, to growth driven more by private enterprises, exports and foreign direct investment.
The launch ceremony at Temple Trees was attended by key corporate leaders, exporters and the members of international trade agencies and diplomatic missions.
Paul Godfrey, Charge d Affaires of the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives said, This National Export Strategy is vital to Sri Lankas trade infrastructure and will consolidate and expand the countrys reach in the region and in European markets. I am sure this Strategy will help Sri Lanka take advantage of GSP+ by both stimulating growth and increasing the prosperity of the peoples of this island.
ITC Executive Director Arancha Gonzlez said, The strategy is a tool to transform the trade landscape of Sri Lanka. By helping to improve the trade environment and by supporting greater local value addition trade could support the creation of better quality jobs.
The National Export Strategy will help the development of new exporters and support the growth of traditional export industries. It identifies six sectors to ensure more value addition and facilitate greater access to regional and global markets. They are: information technology and business process management (IT-BPM); spices and concentrates; wellness tourism; processed food and beverages; boat building; and electronics and electrical components.
The Strategy also focuses on four cross-cutting areas which impact all exporting enterprises, namely the improvement of island-wide logistics services, national quality infrastructure, innovation and entrepreneurship and access to trade information and promotion services.

Sri Lanka is expected to obtain Madrid Protocol accession- the international trademark application filing system by end of this year, which will allow the countrys brands to register their trademarks in a single filing, getting activated across many countries at the same time, affording Trade Mark protection for Sri Lankan brands at a global level.
The National Chamber of Commerce (NCC) in collaboration with the National Intellectual Property Office of Sri Lanka is organizing an awareness seminar on July 26, 2018 from 2.00 to 4.00 p.m at the Chamber Auditorium 450 D R Wijewardene Mw, Colombo  10.
The key speaker a legal consultant retained by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) Jatin Trivedi , Attorney and Advocate from India will be in Sri Lanka to provide assistance to the Govt in the process of accession to Madrid Protocol.
Trivedi will explain in detail at this seminar, with regard to filing trade mark applications through the Madrid system, advantages and other aspects involved. He will be accompanied by Piyush Khatri of Rajasthan Bar Council a legal practitioner for 14 years in IPR and Tax Laws, in India; and Geethanjali R. Ranawaka, Director General NIPO will attend.
The Madrid Protocol system provides for the international registration of trade marks by way of one application that can cover more than one country.
The opportunity of having a single registration to cover a wide range of countries gives advantages, both in terms of portfolio management and cost savings, as opposed to a portfolio of independent national registrations. Madrid provides a mechanism for obtaining trademark protection in many countries around the world.
The Madrid system is administered by the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in Geneva, Switzerland. There are 101 countries as contracting parties of the Madrid System.

Fulfilling a long-felt need of the people of the Mawanella area, steps were taken to construct a new bus stand at the Mawanella town by the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council.
The Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council allocated Rs. 70 million for the construction of the new bus stand and a shopping complex. It is planned to construct the new bus stand and shopping complex at the town centre where the old bus stand is situated.
Sabaragamuwa Governor Niluka Ekanayake said after visiting the project area recently, that the construction work of the bus stand will be completed within a short time with modern facilities and standards.
As there is no proper holding place for public transport buses, the people face hardships especially during rainy days and sunny days.
Accordingly, a four-storeyed building providing space for shops will be constructed along with the proposed bus stand. Under this project, 80 shops at the bus stand will be removed and given proper places at the new building complex.

A New Creature..!
In a home in Colombo there is deep sadness. A father is no more. Whos voice like a shepherds call, kept his flock of children and wife safe together, now just resounds in their minds. I remember Chris Dawson. I remember him arriving at my home nearly thirty years ago, with his brood, concerned over a conflict in his beautiful Lanka. I watched as he a bigger than life figure kept a watchful eye on his family. And today, his wife, my aunt and children, my cousins bow their heads in grief in that home in Colombo.
For them do I pen these lines of comfort:
In a quiet pond lived a little colony of water creatures. They were a happy colony, living far away from the sun, busy, scurrying over the soft mud on the bottom of the pond. They did notice that every once in awhile, one of their colony, clinging to the stem of a pond lily climbed up gradually and moved out of sight and was seen no more.
They were greatly puzzled. Finally, one of them said, "The next one of us who climbs up the lily stalk must promise to come back and tell us where he or she went and why!"
"We promise", they all said solemnly.
One spring day, not long after, the very water creature who had suggested the plan found himself climbing up the lily stalk. Up, up, up, he went. Before he knew what was happening, he had broken through the surface of the water and fallen onto the broad, green lily pad above.
When he awoke, he looked about with surprise. He couldn't believe what he saw. A startling change had come to his old body. His movement revealed four silver wings. He moved those wings and found himself up above the water.
He could fly!
Swooping and dipping in great curves, he flew through the air. He felt exhilarated in his new form and by and by healighted happily on a lily pad to rest.
Then it was he chanced to look below to the bottom of the pond. There were his old friends, scurrying around, just as he had been doing some time before.
He remembered the promise and darted down, hit the surface of the water and bounced away. Now, he realized, he could no longer go back.
"I can't return!" he said in dismay. "Even if I could, not one of them would know me in my new body. I guess I'll just have to wait till they become like me too, then they'll understand what has happened to me, and where I went. Though I feel sad I cant tell them how happy I am, and that I can fly!"
Somewhere above that home in Colombo, my uncle Chris can see you! So dont weep my dear aunt and cousins, your dads not gone, hes just a new creature..!

Nikki Haley attacks UNHRC again
US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley launched another attack on the UN human rights body, calling it a failure for listing such countries as China and Cuba among its members. She had no qualms about Saudi Arabia, though.
Haley was speaking at the Heritage Foundation think tank, explaining the reasons for the US withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council, which had drawn almost unanimous condemnation, on Wednesday. She singled out Cuba, China and Venezuela as the countries whose presence supposedly tarnishes the councils credibility.
Pointing at the Councils membership criteria as one of its two major problems, along with its supposed bias against US ally Israel, Haley said that since she took office and up until now its members included some of the worst human rights violators  the dictatorships of Cuba, China and Venezuela all have seats on the Council.
She took particular aim at Venezuela, slamming the council for inviting the Latin American countrys President Nicolas Maduro, who she labelled a dictator, to address the body in 2015. Haley said it was no wonder Maduro received a standing ovation, as 62 percent of Council members were not democracies.
Accusing the Council of being fixated on Israel, Haley argued that it turns a blind eye to the situation in Venezuela, Cuba and China. She also included Zimbabwe, which is not a member of the HRC.
[The Human Rights Council] has focused its attention unfairly, and relentlessly on Israel meanwhile it ignored the misery, inflicted by regimes in Venezuela, Cuba, Zimbabwe and China.
She ultimately summed up her opinion of the UNHRC by branding it the UNs greatest failure.
Judging by how it has fallen short of its promise, the Human Rights Council is the UNs greatest failure. It has taken the idea of human dignity and it has reduced it to just another instrument of international politics, she said.
Choosing the undemocratic UNHRC members to pick on, Haley preferred to step around Saudi Arabia, another major US ally, and its highly problematic record.
The ultra-conservative kingdom has been embroiled in the bloodshed in Yemen, leading the three-year bombing campaign that resulted in numerous civilian casualties and prompted human rights activists to call for Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salmans arrests for alleged war crimes.
In its recent report, Human Rights Watch said that at least 87 apparently unlawful raids were conducted by the Saudi-led coalition since the onset of the campaign that claimed about 1,000 civilian lives, destroying homes and civilian infrastructure.
Internally, despite loosening some of its decades-old restrictions and allowing women to drive and go to stadiums, Riyadh continues its crackdown on dissent and is not in a hurry to abolish barriers that impede girls and women from making some basic decisions without the prior consent of a male relative.

Continuing previous evening strong batting display, Indain batsman Ayush Badoni scored 185 runs including 19 boundaries and four sixes, facing 205 balls as India piled up a mammoth 589 first innings total to end the innings just after the lunch interval. Nehal Wadhera also batted well to add 82 runs to Indian total. India's latter batsmen did not impress as Lankans picked up the lower order wickets at regular intervals. Mohit Jangra scored 22 runs, but Arjun
Tendulkar had to walked back to the pavilion without scoring a single run.
In reply for the second innings, Lankan batting line up was consolidated by opener Nirmal Fernando who went on to score a superb 104 knock studded with two sixes and seven boundaries, facing 118 balls.
Other Lankan opener Mishara Kamil was the first to lose the wicket when he was on 13 edging a catch to the slip board off Mohit Jangra's delivery. Captain Nipun Dhannjaya joined Nirmal and scored 20 runs. Informed Nirmal was dismissed by Jangra when he edged a catch to Devdutt Padikkal at slips.
Jangra was the only successful bowler as he took all three wickets of the Lankan innings so far. He captured skipper Nipun Dhannjaya behind the wickets as the last wicket of the day. Nuwanidu Fernando (19 runs) and Pasindu Sooriyabandara (20 runs) will open the batting for Sri Lanka today.

Is the oil palm development program threat to rubber industry and environment
Oil palm is being played out as a big issue on the sustainability agenda in our Country now. Despite repeated best efforts by responsible stakeholders including growers, Agri experts and academia, in refuting irrelevant allegations, the topic keeps arising the latest of which is the media pick-up alleging that oil palm cultivation is to replace rubber, arguing that oil palm development program is a threat to the rubber industry and environment.
Professor Asoka Nugawela explains the reality, backed by scientific data and evidence to refute allegations that are being plied to media. At the outset let us understand that government has clearly established a policy to expand the existing oil palm extent in the country to a maximum of 20,000 hectas to substitute oil and fat imports. To achieve the 20,000 hectas target of the government, around 11,000 ha of oil palm will need to be planted newly. Articles stating oil palm to replace rubber gives a false impression that oil palm would replace the entire rubber extent of the country; hence the need to set the record.
Environmental concerns
One scientific factor identified is that the water transpiration of oil palm plants increases from 5.5 to 7.5mm/day during drought periods whereas in rubber it decreases from 4.5 to 2.5 mm/day. The response to drought by the rubber plants is scientific but not that of oil palm. Water transpiration under drought periods, i.e., when the soil water is generally depleted, cannot increase unless the plants are irrigated. Lee Chin et al., (2013) based on a long term lysimetric study that is yet in progress at FELDA, Malaysia reported that under dry weather, but under irrigated conditions, the water transpiration (potential evapotranspiration) of mature oil palm could increase up to 6.5 to 7.5mm/day.
It is common knowledge that water transpiration cannot be higher under drought conditions when soils are depleted of moisture. Under such stressful environmental conditions the stomatal pore size of leaves in whatever plant species are reduced. The stomata of plants play a key role in plant water relations and under water stress conditions the plants reduce their stomatal pore size to control the water loss from the plants through transpiration. This change in stomatal pore size of plants is triggered by plant hormonal action. If not for this mechanism found in plants they would succumb to water stress conditions. Based on such un-scientific thinking it cannot be concluded that oil palm consumes water to the extent to create water shortages in oil palm cultivated areas.
There is a misconception that high quantities of nutrients, i.e., more than ten times, are added to oil palm plantations in the form of chemical fertilizer when comparing with rubber (Table 1).
According to Table 1, the amount of chemical fertilizer recommended for a mature rubber tree per annum by the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) of Sri Lanka is generally in the region of 509g whereas for oil palm it is 6,123g, as per statistics from Coconut Research Institute. However, there is no blanket recommendation to give 509g of fertilizer per mature rubber tree per year by RRI. Even with soil and foliar analysis based fertilizer recommendation, there is no such standard quantity to be applied to a tree throughout its economic life span. The mixture and quantities recommended generally differ from field to field as it is intended to be and within a field too, once every three years if there are changes in the soil and foliar nutrient levels. If 509g per tree per year is taken as an average dosage inclusive of last six years of the economic cycle where no fertilizer was applied, then the corresponding dosage for oil palm has to be taken for comparison. Similarly, if it is assumed that certain mature rubber trees will not be fertilized due to not been productive, why is the same logic not applied to oil palm
If the fertilizer usages of the two crops are to be compared on the basis of soil and foliar recommendations, then the comparable soil and foliar recommended dosage should be taken for the oil palm crop as well. With a soil and foliar analysis based fertilizer recommendation for oil palm the current recommended dosage of 6,123g per palm would definitely be reduced. Oil palm cultivators in Sri Lanka have therefore already taken initiatives to adopt soil and foliar based recommendations in their oil palm plantations. Progress on this is slow mainly due to the lack of a dedicated research institution to provide technical support for this crop.
In the absence of soil and foliar based fertilizer recommendations for oil palm right now, a fair scientific approach to compare the relative nutrient need of the two crops would be to take the conventional mixtures and dosages recommended for both crops. A summary of the conventional fertilizer mixtures recommended for rubber by the Rubber Research Institute is given in Table 2.
In table 2, only the fertilizer usage during mature phase of the crops has been compared. However, to do a fair comparison of the fertilizer usage of the two crops, the dosage recommended for the entire life span has to be considered. On comparison, fertilizer usage per hectare of oil palm is only around twice the quantity recommended for rubber and not 10 times.
It is also claimed that the chemical fertilizer need for rubber plantations is less due to nutrient recycling through the defoliation and re-foliation process of this deciduous type plant species. Generally nutrient recycling happens in both deciduous and non-deciduous type of plant species. The difference lies in that deciduous plants all leaves are shed simultaneously whilst in non-deciduous plants, leaves are shed as and when a leaf becomes non-contributing to the growth of the plant. This happens when the respiration rate of leaves become higher than the photosynthetic rate either due to aging, diseases or physical damages. Hence nutrient recycling occurs in oil palm plantations as well. However, in oil palm the old non-contributory fronds are systematically removed through an important agricultural practice named frond management. They are methodically stacked within the plantations as mulch for soil, moisture conservation and for nutrient recycling.
In addition to the fronds, the solid wastes generated from the oil palm processing factories, i.e., empty fruit bunches and remnants of the mesocarp of fruits are added to the plantations to improving soil physical and chemical properties. To argue that rubber plantations recycle nutrients whereas oil palm plantations do not, is non-scientific.
With nutrient management strategies together with soil and moisture conservation practices in place there is no way that the soil in oil palm plantations get degraded to the extent that replanting cannot be undertaken. Successful oil palm replantings with no signs of growth retardation could be seen at Nakiadeniya Estate where second generation oil palm plantations exist. We need to understand that soil degradation reported in any plantation is not the fault of a particular crop or plant species, but perhaps due to bad agricultural practices carried out by the relevant management.
A common concern is that effluents released by oil palm factories amount to nearly 75% of the weight of fresh fruit bunches and are highly toxic to animals. In oil palm fruits, the oil extraction rate and hence the oil content is around 22 to 23% of the fresh weight and the balance goes as waste material. However, the empty fruit bunches and the milled mesocarp is used in the plantations as soil amendments. Further, the shell of the nut is used to generate renewable energy to power the factories. All oil palm factories are self-sufficient in its energy requirement and therefore not dependent on the national grid for the same. Out of the 75% waste material, the majority are used productively and in an environmentally friendly manner. Since, no chemicals are used during the processing, the effluent coming out of oil palm factories will consist of only natural compounds/products bio-synthesized by the palm. Such natural compounds/products, i.e. fats, carbohydrates, sugar, proteins and amino acids are being treated using conventional waste water treatment plants to prevent bad smell odor emanating if released to the environment un-treated. Also, since oil extracted from it is consumed by human beings it is highly unlikely that effluent would contain toxic compounds to harm any other animals.
A scientifically established fact is that palm oil, which is rich in vitamin E is the most accepted ingredient, being used globally in the manufacture of skin and hair creams. In Sri Lanka there have been random claims that dogs who have consumed ripe oil palm fruits have shed their coat of fur. There is no scientific proof which links consumption of oil palm fruits to shedding of fur.
Impact on natural rubber industry and way forward
In addition to the environmental allegations, let me clarify concerns about depleting natural rubber production and its impact on the lucrative rubber product manufacturing industry in the country. Declining natural rubber production in the country is a serious issue for which interventions are needed. But, is the intervention alternative to prohibit the growth of another industry, vital for the economy of the country I do not think its the correct strategy but any how let us analyze some key performance indicators of the natural rubber industry (Table 3) to find out what should be the correct interventions are.
Our national production of natural rubber is in a declining trend and in 2016 it stood as 79.1 thousand MT. National yield is as low as 800 kg/ha/year. With low land productivity, the cost of production of natural rubber will be so high that plantation companies will not be making returns on investment on rubber lands. Negative cash flow scenarios created in this background will further reduce essential inputs to rubber plantations worsening the situation. It leads to a vicious cycle. However, this scenario is not new and had being in existence even during pre-privatization era as well. Also this declining trend in land productivity is true for other plantation crops like tea and coconut. At national level there should be a concerted effort to develop short, mid and long term strategies to arrest this declining trend in the plantation sector. In addition the experts in the industry, genuinely concerned about the negative growth of the industry can share their knowledge to turnaround the trend.
The plantation sector needs to be viewed holistically. A diversification strategy of crops bringing in a high Return on Investment (ROI) is the logical process. Oil palm and cinnamon fall into the high ROI category and hence investing in such crops is a no-brainer. If trading is poor in some crops the other crops would compensate. An expert of a particular crop should evolve into an agri-expert that understands trends and advocates the big agri picture and the benefits that plantation companies and the country could accrue. A plantation would be financially much stronger with a relatively higher number of crops rather than just one or two.
For average land productivity of rubber to be 800 in our country, the range should be around 500 to 1200 kg/ha/year. The government intention is to expand the oil palm extent by a further 11,000 ha to make the current extent of around 9,000 ha to 20,000ha. For this diversification program the poor performing rubber lands with lowest productivity levels will be used. If 11,000 ha of 500kg yielding rubber lands are converted to oil palm over a period of say four years, by planting 2,750 ha per year the immediate loss of rubber production will be around will be 1.4 thousand MT (500kg * 2,750ha). This is only 1.8% of our current national production and only about 0.9% of our current domestic consumption. Can this level of drop in natural rubber production due to expansion of oil palm cultivation in the country be a huge threat to the rubber products manufacturing industry in the country
In Sri Lanka the use of rain guards to overcome crop losses due to interference of rain on harvesting and adoption of low frequency tapping to overcome issues related to harvester shortages are at a very low level. The two factors identified above contribute to around 40 % loss of crop annually. If we recover this crop loss in at least 50% of the countrys total rubber revenue extent the national production could be increased by 15 thousand MT in a year, which is about 19% of our current national production or around 11% of our current domestic consumption.
Our vision should be to not depend on any country for our raw rubber requirement. We should adopt strategies like improved land productivity and increasing extent to meet our national targets. Certain plantation companies have demonstrated global leadership in managing rubber plantations. They should be motivated to take forward their business plans rather than enforcing restrictions. It is said that the private sector is the engine of the growth and development of a country; they must be allowed to progress uninhibitedly and be the standards and benchmarks for driving the plantation industry forward.
Productivity and yields
Low land productivity of oil palm in our Country remains an issue. Our national yield is around 18,000 kg/ha/year whereas the potential is 30,000 kg/ha/year. Through enhanced land productivity the revenue generated from this crop could easily be doubled so that cash flow improves and is ploughed back on currently poor performing crops like tea and rubber.
Whatever the crop, we need to achieve potential land productivity levels and thereby maximize earnings. Never ever wait for high NSAs, which is determined elsewhere and for which we do not have any say.
Other concerns of oil palm
Oils and fats derived from oil palm crop have a wide range of applications. Apart from being used for cooking purposes, it is used to manufacture almost 40-50% of goods available in a super market to-day. Bakery products, confectionaries, chocolates, biscuits, noodles, milk powder, soaps, detergents, skin and hair care creams and oils, margarines and some medicines are a few examples. Oils and fats derived from our coconut industry and imported to the country as palm oil are used for the production of all these goods.
The reality is that we are even struggling to meet the coconut requirement to obtain coconut milk necessary for our day to day cooking purposes.
For whomever that vocalizes unknowingly that the trunk of oil palm does not have any uses, one has only to visit the web site of Malaysian Oil Palm Board to be exposed to the value of the oil palm trunk. In Sri Lanka once the oil palm industry develops and when there is sufficient number of uprooting fields it would definitely create an opportunity for investments. And By The Way, molgas or pestle used for pounding of rice cannot be made out of palm oil trunk. If this is a worry, let the reader rest assured that our local pestle is made of the Kithul palm trunk, rather than any other tree.
Potential and realities
Twenty thousand hectares of oil palm in Sri Lanka has the potential to save valuable foreign exchange moving out of the country, improve the financial performance of plantation management companies and to upgrade the livelihood of plantation workers.
Environmental degradation that is talked about is not due the crop but due to bad practices adopted during cultivation in other countries like Indonesia where virgin forests are cut for this purpose.
If someone argues that by converting less than 3% of the existing land extent under plantation crops (around 700,000ha) to oil palm which would consume an additional 10-15% of water would result in a situation where we will have to import water- it is a gross exaggeration. Malaysia, with its humungous extents of oil palm for the last 100 years, should be importing water from a long time ago. In reality Malaysia exports water to Singapore.

Oman Air resumes service to Maldives from October
Oman Air, the national carrier of the Sultanate of Oman, will resume its service between Muscat and Mal in the Maldives this October. Flights to the Maldives with Oman Air will recommence for the 2018-19 winter season from October 28. The service will be operated by the new Boeing 737 aircraft.
Oman Air flights from Muscat to Maldives will operate on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday and the flight from the Maldives to Muscat will operate on Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.
The Maldives is a beautiful chain of 26 ring atolls, made up of more than 1,000 coral islands, located only three and a half hours away from Oman. Well known for its beaches, blue lagoons and extensive reefs, the Maldives is an incredibly popular tourist destination with an increasing number of international visitors arriving year on year.
Eng. Abdulaziz Al Raisi, CEO of Oman Air said: We are delighted to be resuming our Maldives route and look forward to welcoming our valued Oman Air guests on board our latest Boeing 737 aircraft. We thoroughly encourage our friends from Europe and the rest of our network, flying to the Maldives to stop over and explore Oman en route. Our new Maldives service offers holidaymakers the perfect opportunity to explore Muscat, the metropolitan capital of Oman before escaping to the beautiful shores of the Maldives.
Oman Airs fleet and network has continued to grow. This expansion has been aided by continued investment in Oman Airs award winning on-board experience, exemplified by the MAX aircraft. The new MAX will be equipped with 12 new Business Class seats with large 17 inch touch screen monitors and all the amenities needed for a frequent flyer such as individual power and USB points. By the end of 2018 Oman Air will have taken delivery of five new MAX aircraft and three 787-9s. By 2022, Oman Airs total fleet size is expected to be around 70.
The relaunch of the Maldives service comes at an exciting time, as Oman Air recently started their flights to Istanbul in June with operations scheduled to Casablanca in July and Moscow in October. Oman Air continues to be recognised for its award winning on board experience; winning an array of industry awards to add to its growing collection.

Ordeal at sea
After a two-week ordeal, the seven Sri Lankan fishermen stranded for days at sea, off the Maldivian coast, returned to the country last Tuesday (July 17).
The 41-foot fishing boat Sindhur-2 left the Galle Fisheries Harbour with the seven, on June 14. Susil, Samantha, Rohana, Asela, Dhaminda, Kalindu and Janith took with them food supplies for a month, hoping to return to the country safe and sound, not in the least expecting the trouble that would befall them.
The only hope that fishermen have when they leave the shore is that if they are stranded at sea, the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) would track their location and assist the authorities to rescue them. VMS is a satellite-based monitoring system which at regular intervals provides data to the fisheries authorities on the location, course and speed of vessels.
Until June 29, the fishermen continued to have contact with their fellow fishermen who were also at sea, and others in the country. However, on June 30, they realised that the VMS had stopped working and that they were stranded.
Technical failure
Susil Praneetha, one of the fishermen, said that when they realised that the VMS had faltered, they panicked thinking they were not going to get out alive.
In the meantime, Kalindu Chandana (26) said the battery had failed, and as a result, the VMS stopped working. We know the basics of repairing the VMS, but this fault was beyond our knowledge. We tried everything possible to make it work, but we could not, he said.
Susil Praneetha said that when they found that the VMS had stopped functioning, they were already far away from Sri Lankan shores. He further said that the relevant company had shut down the VMS services, and by the time they realised it, they were in the high seas, off the Maldives.
When the technology failed, we resorted to traditional methods to signal that we were stranded, said S.H. Samantha. They lit a fire and waved flags in the hope that they would be rescued. Speaking about the bitter experience they had, he said that it was one of the most painful he had ever faced.
We left the Galle Fisheries Harbour on June 14 and up to June 29 there were no issues. We, as usual, carried on fishing. On June 30, we could not start the boat and when we checked, the battery was not working, he said.
Samantha said that they always carry two extra batteries, but for some reason even that failed to work. Even though they tried hard to restart the boat, they could not.
Susil Praneetha said that their world was torn apart when they realised that the VMS had also faltered. According to Susil, the company had deactivated the service despite their paying Rs.2,800 per month just for the service.
The boat was sailing in the high seas for 11 days before they became stranded. Once they realised they were stranded, the fishermen continued to signal for help, hoping someone would save them. After three days, a Maldivian fishing boat detected them and requested the fishermen to get onboard.
Susil said the Sri Lankan fishermen refused to get onboad the Maldivian boat because it is illegal to do so. The Maldivian fishermen thereafter informed the Maldivian coast guard about the Sri Lankan fishermen.
The Maldivian fishermen stayed with us until the coast guard arrived. We were also very scared. We did not want them to leave us there, he said.
Janith Prasanga Kumara said that the Maldivian fishermen constantly assured them that they were in safe hands and that they need have no fear for their safety. In three hours, the Maldivian coast guard arrived. The Sri Lankan fishermen refused to leave their boat at mid-sea and return to shore with the coast guard. Therefore, they had to wait until evening when another boat arrived to take their boat ashore.
Even though we have returned to Sri Lanka, our boat is still in the Maldives. If the VMS was working, we would not have faced these issues, Janith said.
Sunil said that when he called his family from the Maldives, they burst into tears and were in so much pain to know of the fishermens ordeal. He said that the villagers lit firecrackers when they learnt that the fishermen were safe. The Sri Lankan fishermen said their boat owner Saman Priyanthas brother-in-law Upul, who is in the Maldives, helped them a great deal. They requested the Fisheries Minister to take steps to ensure the VMS system for fishing boats works continuously to avoid similar situations in the future. A fisherman of Sindhur -2, Samantha Sellaheththadhi said that they were expecting that they would be rescued soon.
We remembered our families and friends when we were stranded at sea. We were waiting for someone to come and rescue us. If we had a proper method to communicate with the Navy, we need not have undergone all these troubles. But unfortunately, we were stranded in the sea for nearly three days, he said. The fishermen said even though they could not understand the Maldivian language, they managed to communicate with those fishermen in sign language.
After they were rescued, Upul took them to his room and provided them with all necessary facilities.
Janith said that they never gave up hope of being rescued.
We have not done anything wrong and we continued to pray to God to save us, he said.
Minister assures security
Soon after the fishermen arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) on Tuesday, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa and State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi invited them for a meeting at the Ministry.
The fishermen requested that the VMS facility be properly maintained and that their security is ensured when they leave Sri Lankan shores.
Asela Chamantha thanked the Minister, State Minister and other officials for taking all possible measures to rescue them. He said that they had enough food and water and there were no issues in this regard. Sunil told the Minister that their boat was still in the Maldives and requested help to bring it back.
The boat owner has to spend nearly Rs.23 lakhs to bring the boat back and that is a huge amount of money, he said, adding that the owner will be leaving to the Maldives soon to sort out the documentation.
The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry said that they could not track the fishermen as the battery of the VMS failed and communication was barred as a result. The Ministry said that the fishermen were found close to the Maldives.
The fishermen said that if the VMS was working properly, they could have been tracked and rescued easily.
Fisheries Department Director General Prasanna Ginige said that the radio system of the boat was also not working and there was no communication with the radio unit of the Fisheries Department. However, the Fisheries Ministry, the Foreign Affairs Ministry, and the Maldivian Embassy took every initiative to bring the fishermen back to Sri Lanka.
He said that India and the Maldives assisted the authorities to locate the missing fishermen.
The Fisheries Minister assured the fishermen that the Ministry would take all possible measures to avoid a similar situation in the future. There could have been issues with the VMS. There were mistakes on our side as well as theirs. We have now decided to introduce new reliable technology to track their location, he said.
He said a new unit with smart technology will be established to ensure the safety of fishermen and added that a communication officer and a controller will be appointed for the unit.
Minister Zoysa said that measures have also been taken to provide VMS to even small boats with the support of the Australian government.
The fishermen were provided lunch at the Fisheries Ministry and bidden goodbye with the assurance that the Ministry would take all necessary measures to uplift their lives as well as protect the lives of fishermen.

MRs driver encashed cheques worth millions
Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara yesterday said FCID investigations have revealed that cheques worth millions have been encashed by a driver of the ex-president Rajapaksa.
He said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has fled to Singapore to dodge the adjournment debate on the New York Times report alleging that USD 7.6 BN payment has been done by the China Harbour Company to Rajapaksas Presidential election campaign in 2015. He said that the disciples of Rajapaksa are trying every possible method to ruin the adjournment debate.
A complain is lodged against one Sarath Dissanayake, the driver, who has encashed a cheque worth Rs. 12 BN. Then this money was distributed among officers during the Presidential election time. I have four cheques each valued Rs. 25 MN with me right now. Two cheques worth Rs. 250 MN each have been encashed via a sub account belonging to the China Harbour Company. Another two cheques worth Rs. 250 MN each, have been encashed at the Standard Chartered Bank, Deputy Minister Bandara said.
An employee of Temple Trees called Hewa Madiwela has accepted this money. He was not alive now. We suspect his death too. It has been reported that his family is very poor. You have to answer these questions. Or perhaps they have used an already dead person as a decoy and arrange a set up, Bandara said.
Deputy Minister Bandara said they would not allow anyone to evade these allegations. He said the sum of money in question is humongous. This is over 7 billion we are talking about. Only 9 BN was spent to build the Lotus Tower, he said.
Referring to the shortage of JO members present at the House, Deputy Minister Bandara said that JO MPs should have flocked into the House to defend their leader and clear him out of the allegation.
No need to panic about this now. Tell Mahinda Rajapaksa to come and answer these allegations. There is no point attacking the MP who moved this adjournment motion. You cannot cover up these corrupted actions by hiding behind standing orders. MP Dinesh Gunawardena is also trying to protect thieves, Bandara said.
Mattala Airport will be made active within five years
The Government is discussing with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to develop the Mattala International Airport as a joint venture and make it an active airport in the region within five years, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
The minister in response to Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake briefed Parliament yesterday the proposed joint venture and undertook to present the draft agreement to the House before inking it.
The minister said the stakes of the joint company to be formed to operate the Mattala Airport would be 70 per cent to the Indian Airport Authority and 30 per cent to the Sri Lankan Government.
He said the Government has laid several preconditions for the venture. The first precondition is that the AAI should agree with the Government Chief Valuers estimation for the 70 per cent stake and should pay the total amount. The airport can only be used for commercial purposes and it cannot be used for any military purposes. The air navigation must only be carried out by the locals and no foreigner can involve in that work. The airport security must be handled by the Air Force and the Airport staff. The fire extinguishing and emergency operations are also handled by the locals, the minister said.
The minister said the jobs of 574 workers in the airport will be assured. He said it has been included as a precondition.
The minister said a business plan was requested from the AAI detailing how the airport will be turned around as an active airport within five years. The minister said the agreement with the AAI would be done aboveboard. He said amending the Civil Aviation Act is necessary before inking it as the legislation does not allow majority shares of any airport to be held by a foreign party. This amendment will come to Parliament. Its approval is necessary to go forward in this venture. If you all object, the amendment will not pass. We have nothing to hide here, the minister said.
The minister said the massive loans obtained to construct the Mattala International Airport are paid by the profits of the Bandaranaike International Airport in Katunayake. He said this could not be done for long.
We need to turn around the airport into a profit making venture. I presented a Cabinet memorandum on December 1, 2015 proposing to call for investment proposals from interested parties, local or foreign. There had been six minor proposals but they were inadequate. When I went to China with the Prime Minister, we invited Chinese investors, but none showed interest. However, Airports Authority of India expressed interest and I informed this to the Cabinet. A Technical Evaluation Committee and the Negotiation Committee were appointed and discussions are now carried forward, the minister said.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunwardena questioned the minister whether he agrees that there was a necessity of a second international airport in Sri Lanka. Minister Siripala replied affirmatively. Minister Kabir Hashim questioned him why the previous regime could not make it a commercially viable venture if there had been such a necessity.
MP Anura Dissanayake, raising a question under the Standing Order 27 (2), said the Government should retain the ownership of the Mattala Airport as it is important to the countrys security and economy. He said that giving it to a foreign entity would risk the countrys sovereignty.
Media tarnishing my reputation: Fonseka
Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, denying the allegations levelled against him by the Joint Opposition that he has connection with the underworld, said the media reports on him must be part of a political agenda.
Displaying a photograph of four persons to the House, Minister Fonseka said the person behind the media report is someone who has connections with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The person in a yellow shirt did this media report. The one standing next to him in an orange shirt is your leader. The other one is a bodyguard, Minister Fonseka said showing the photograph to the House.
So it is very obvious that this reporter has a political agenda, the Minister said.
The photograph was taken at former President Rajapaksas official residence at Wijerama Mawatha after the recent Local Government Elections, Minister Fonseka said.
Minister Fonseka urged the President, Prime Minister, Speaker and the Law and Order Minister to investigate the violence inflicted upon the public by certain law enforcement officers with political backing. Fonseka said several of his political supporters were taken into custody alleging that they are drug dealers. Law enforcement authorities cannot go around acting like underworld gangs. Police, military and the STF are dignified services. They cannot act as irresponsible entities. Such actions must be investigated,the Minister said.
Minister Fonseka said the allegation against him that he has underworld gang members for his security tarnishes the image of officers providing him security. I get State security. I have 18 officers for my security. Among them are four inspectors and five STF officers. They have a reputation to maintain. They are respectable . Allegations such as these ruin their image, he said.
Government funded British MPs holidays in Sri Lanka:
Bimal calls for investigation
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake yesterday (19) urged for an investigation on the British MP who faced a 30-day suspension after he failed to declare the details of two family holidays he spent in 2013 along with his family, paid for by the Sri Lankan government. Rathnayake requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that Foreign Ministry should conduct this investigation.
Rathnayake, joining the Adjournment Debate on the recent New York Times report on a payment of 7.6 BN USD by a Chinese company to former President Mahinda Rajapaksas Presidential Election Campaign, brought attention of the House on a news article published on the BBC international website on the same day.
According to this article, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Ian Paisley may be forced to step down from his post due to the failure to clear his name.
He may have to face a by-election after being found to have breached parliamentary rules. The MP faces a 30-day suspension after he failed to declare the details of two family holidays in 2013 paid for by the Sri Lankan government.
According to the article, Paisley and his family had spent two holidays spending Pounds 100,000 in Sri Lanka in 2013 funded by the Sri Lankan government.
Paisley had flew in business class, stayed in the finest hotels and was provided with a chauffeur-driven Mercedes, all paid for by the Sri Lankan government,the article said.
The problem is who gave this MP that money and under whose authority it was done It has been said that the Sri Lankan government gave him that holidays in return to promoting Sri Lanka. But we cannot see any result out of that so called deal. The Speaker and the Foreign Affairs Ministry should launch an investigation into this matter, Rathnayake said.
Taking money from Chinese Company for MRs election campaign:
Betrayal of country, not financial corruption
Highway and Higher Education Minister Kabir Hashim said the government consider the alleged payments made by the China Harbour Engineering Company to former President Mahinda Rajapaksas election campaign in 2015 not as a financial corruption but as a betrayal of the country and urged for a complete investigation into the allegations made by New York Times report in this regard.
This serious allegation is levelled against a person and a group who present themselves as the saviours of the country. They call themselves patriots. Accepting bribes from a foreign company puts the sovereignty of the country at risk. We take this act not as a financial corruption but as an act of betrayal, Minister Hashim said.
Minister Hashim said it was unfortunate that former President Rajapaksa not coming forward to answer the allegations levelled against him. Instead, the JO MPs are trying to disrupt this debate. Unlike this, when our government had to face the allegations against the Treasury Bond issue, we faced the debate and proved our innocence, he said.
Minister Hashim said it was the present government and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who bettered the agreement between China and Sri Lanka on the Hambantota Port.
Immediately before the 2015 Presidential Election, came another document called the Key Term Agreement. This came in September 2014. Ten days before the election, cheques worth USD 7.6 BN had been given out via a sub account of this China Harbour Company. Fortunately for the country, they were not able to receive the Cabinet approval for this agreement. So we were able to cancel this secret agreement and sign a new agreement beneficial for the country. Minister Hashim said.
Referring to the Concessionary Framework Agreement on Hambantota Port signed in 2012, Minister Hashim said 50 acres surrounding the Hambantota Port were sold to China for just 1 US dollar.
If this agreement was by any chance activated, Sri Lanka Navy would not have been able to access the Hambantota Port, he said. Then Finance Ministry Secretary P.B. Jayasundara signed this agreement on behalf of the government, he said. Minister Hashim said China Harbour Company with whom the previous government signed the Hambantota, MOUs is not a terminal operator.
They were only a contractor. The present company we have signed the agreement with, is the second best terminal operator of the world, he said.
Expert Panel Report on constitutional reforms will be discussed with PM
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said he would discuss with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is also the Steering Committee Chairman, the issues cropped up on the Expert Panel report on the constitutional reforms.
Heated arguments were exchanged in Parliament yesterday over the discussion paper of the Constitutional Amendments prepared by the Expert Panel.
The Steering Committee, when it met on Wednesday, had rejected the discussion paper prepared by the Expert Panel as it was revealed that it lacked unanimous agreement of the panel. The 10-member Expert Panel has been asked to meet again and arrive at a consensus on the discussion paper.
Minister Kabir Hashim said the House that the draft of the constitutional amendments will be presented only after a broad discussion to accommodate the opinions of all parties involved in its making.
SLFP Group of 16 MP Dayasiri Jayasekara brought to the attention of the House that the Expert Panel had been divided on its report and that four of its 10 members had not signed it. Only Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne, M. A. Sumanthiran and Suren Fernando had involved in the drafting of the constitutional amendments. This was said by the expert committee members. A conspiracy has been hatched to remove the President through the constitutional amendments. A provision has been included for the first time allowing the Prime Minister, Speaker and the Opposition Leader to remove the President if all the three agree. We are not ready to support any constitution making to fulfill the narrow political motives of several individuals, he charged.
Joint Opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage accused that a signature of an Expert Committee member had been forged in the report. This member had not come to Sri Lanka for six months now. He is overseas, but the report submitted yesterday contained his signature, he noted.
Previous regimes large projects, loans ruined our country
The country has lost its economic and political independence due to economically nonviable large-scale projects of the previous regime and the massive loans and commissions obtained to construct them, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
The JVP leader said the damage the country suffers in long-term due to those projects, loans and commissions is much larger than the colossal sum of money hoarded by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in the pretext of the Presidential Election campaign.
Presenting a series of cheque numbers, their dates and names of persons who encashed them, MP Dissanayake said former President Rajapaksa had received nearly Rs. 198 million from the China Harbour Engineering Company Limited on the verge of January 8, 2015 polls.
He said the China Machinery Engineering Corporation, the company that constructed the Norochcholai Power Plant, had given Rs. 1.29 million to D. S. Abeysinghe, close associate of former MP Sarana Gunawardena. A share of this money was said to be spent on election propaganda campaign of the former President. He said former President Rajapaksa had also received Rs. 105 million from local road construction companies on the verge of 2015 presidential polls. Recently, there was controversy over PTL buying the MPs. Now we see that the Chinese companies with their commissions had bought even the State leaders, he said.
MP Dissanayake detailing on the CICT payment of Rs. 19.4 million made to the Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation owned by former Minister Basil Rajapaksas wife, said this sum has been accounted as an expenditure of the CICT, and therefore when the term of contract ends, the Sri Lankan Government is bound to repay it to the company as per the contract agreement.
China has 85 percent stake of the CICT, which operates the Colombo South jetty, while the Ports Authority holds 15 percent stake. When we get back the jetty after 35 years from 2012, we have to pay the sum of money the company had made to Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation as well. It is ironic that the people who involved in this kind of serious frauds and corruption are clamouring of patriotism today. They are pointing finger at financial frauds of the government, he said.
He said the feasibility report of the Mattala Airport contains false statistics. It says the airport will make 30,000 flights per year and 150,000 MT of goods. In contrary, the airport since its opening in 2013 has so far not been able to make at least 100 flights and 10 MT of goods had not been exchanged through it, he said.
He said that when China funded the Hambantota Port, it had the presumption that it can own it after the construction.
These projects did not tally with the countrys economic strategy. Ultimately, the countrys economic independence hangs in balance. Only those who depend on the Rajapaksa family for their political survival can cover up this kind of serious financial crimes. They are just puppets dancing to the tune of Rajapaksa, he said.
JO attempts to hamper NYT report debate twice
The Joint Opposition members tried to hamper the debate on New York Times report twice yesterday by raising the question of lack of quorum of 20 MPs in Parliament while the debate was on.
The debate abruptly ended an hour before the scheduled time as there was no quorum. The JO MP Indika Anuruddha stood up and said that there was no quorum to continue the debate when UNP MP Wijepala Hettiarachchi was speaking at around 6.45pm.
UNP MP Heshan Vithanage, who chaired the House at that moment, ordered to ring the quorum bell to summon parliamentarians. However, only nine MPs were remained in the Chamber after five minutes of the quorum bell. Therefore, the Chair announced that the sitting would be adjourned until today. Several JO MPs who were present in the chamber at that time, were seen deliberately leaving the chamber when the quorum bell went off.
TBC panelists daughter worked at Temple Trees during its proceeding
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, raising a conflict of interest concern, yesterday alleged that a panelist of the Treasury Bond Commission (TBC) had a daughter working at Temple Trees while the Commission proceeded. Dissanayake said it was a serious matter.
Many allegations surfaced after the Bond Commission report came out. One was of controversial telephone conversations. Another was of cheque transactions. The latest is of a Commission member having a daughter working at Temple Trees while the commission inquiries were going on, he said.
Dissanayake inquired about certain documents which were not handed over to Parliament along with the Bond Commission report. He said the second debate on the Bond Commission report and the PRECIFAC report delayed. The first debate on the two reports was held on February 6. The second debate was postponed due to technical difficulties. According to the Attorney General, several documents which are not annexed to the Bond report are confidential.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the party leaders have agreed to wait until all the documents which not annexed to the Bond Commission report are submitted to Parliament to table them. Speaker Jayasuriya said the new Secretary to the President was taking necessary steps with regard to the matter.

The Prime Ministers Office has vehemently condemned the malicious statement made against Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission (SLHRC) Chairperson Dr. Mrs Deepika Udagama recently and directed the IGP to conduct an investigation about it. The Prime Ministers Office in a press release issued yesterday said the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission is an independent institution appointed under the provisions of the Sri Lanka Constitution. Threats of this nature posed to the Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission and publication of such irresponsible statements through the print media is a matter of serious concern.
The Prime Ministers Office has therefore instructed the IGP to ensure the security of the Chairperson and other members of the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission and the staff of the Commission.

Port City Dredger rescues drowning  deep sea fishermen
Colombo Port City dredger Xin Hai Feng, rescued two local fishermen last Monday. The fishermen were found floating on a barrel in the outer break water area, and a timely rescue mission was mounted by Port City officials.
The two fishermen aged 64 and 57, had gone deep sea fishing in a rented boat on the 14th of July and had run into trouble when the engine failed and the boat struck a reef. They had abandoned the damaged boat and begun to swim with the aid of an empty diesel keg, helplessly floating in the rough sea for over 3 hours.
The captain of the Xin Hai Feng, which was approaching the reclamation area through its regular sailing path, had spotted the near to drowning fishermen and requested his crew to change course, bringing the dredger to a halt. He then informed the Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Dredging Company (SDC), Wang Zhen Ning, and the Health, Safety and Environmental (HSC) Manager of China Harbour Engineering Company, who together made immediate arrangements to launch a rescue mission.
The Port City team took measures to provide first aid and medical attention to the fishermen who had been in a weakened state after going without food and water in the rough seas for over 48 hours. Since the wave height was approx. 1.5 - 2 meters at the time of the rescue operation, they had to use a heavier barge rather than a light weight speed boat to launch the rescue. The harbour police was also informed of the incident.
The fishermen were rescued at 13:59 hours and Sunil Anthony (64) was dispatched to the National Hospital in an ambulance, accompanied by the HSE manager of CHEC and transferred to the Emergency Treatment unit. Ranjith Igneshes (57) followed in a second ambulance and was accompanied by the Safety Officer of Fourth Harbour Engineering Company (FHEC), Kasun Geenath. The families of the fishermen were informed of the situation by the Port City team.
According to a report on the incident filed by W. H. Kosala Perera, HSE Manager of CHEC, the two fishermen who were from the Hendala Wattala area had said that they had asked other fishermen for help when their boat hit trouble but they had not been afforded any, and had to fend for themselves.

## Title: Preserving our forests

## Section: Editorial
## Date: Friday, July 20, 2018 - 01:00
Preserving our forests
The government is set to embark on a massive reforestation drive to arrest the rapid dwindling of forest cover in the country. President Maithripala Sirisena, addressing the 24th Session of the Committee on Forestry, of the Food & Agriculture Organization in Rome said his government was planning to plant five million trees by 2020 and increase forest cover to 32 percent, from the present 29.7 percent, through better practices to improve land governance as a key measure to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals target. He noted that two centuries ago more than 50 percent of the land area in Sri Lanka was covered by forests and this had dwindled by the nearly half the area over the decades. He said the government was keen to raise the forest cover and manage the forests sustainably, since they provide many socio-economic benefits, including food, energy and shelter which are basic human needs.
Of course the world has changed drastically over the past two centuries and Sri Lanka is no exception. Two centuries ago only a small fraction of the present population inhabited this land and there was no pressing demand for land. Besides, the colonial rulers, who some accuse of plundering this country of its wealth, protected the country's forest cover which is a wealth by itself. Even when the British left our shores, much of the 50 percent of the country's forest cover, mentioned by the President remained, intact. Also when they built the present rail system the British took great care not to harm the country's forests, according to some writers.
Even in the immediate post independence era, the country's rulers took great care to nurture our forests and prevent their destruction despite the various colonization schemes undertaken. Leaders such as D.S. Senanayake and Dudley Senanayake took the lead in this respect. Strict laws were enacted with a view to conserve our forests and save them from the two legged predators.
However, with the passage of time, and the increase in the population, together with the transformation of the socio-economic landscape, the demand for land space rose, which necessitated making inroads into the forests. The population boom also saw forests being cleared for human habitation. It was inevitable that our forests will be a prime casualty with the invasion of development into the rural outback.
But what is unpardonable is the callous destruction of our forest cover for failed development projects by the powers that be. We say this because over 10,000 acres of forest land was destroyed for the construction of the Mattala airport in Hambantota, leaving in its wake a trail of destruction of animal life. In an attempt at redressing the balance the then rulers commenced a campaign to plant a million trees, drafting in the schools for the project, failing to realize that planting tress elsewhere would not compensate for the lost forest cover in Hambantota which sheltered animals and contributed to the ecological well-being.
Not only that, large swaths of forest cover are still being cleared for hotel projects, now that tourism has taken on new dimensions, with tourists preferring to dwell in natural settings. This has been a phenomenon over the years with politicians permitting hoteliers and businessmen to exploit our forests to rake in the shekels. Dwindling forest cover is also the major contributor to the raging human-elephant conflict today. What alternative do these beasts have when their habitats have been encroached on by man for greed, but to invade villages
Felling of trees in forests for timber is going on apace with the construction boom and the police have been helpless to arrest this situation since in most instances the logging has the sanction of powerful politicians. Unlike in the past, the erratic weather patterns brought about by the massive destruction of forest cover has made farmers unable to predict the onset of the seasons accurately, with this unpreparedness affecting their harvests. Gushing waterfalls and spouts in the hill country have been virtually reduced to a trickle today, impacted by the dwindling forest cover.
The President will have to contend with all these factors if his plan to increase the county's forest cover by another three percent over the next two years is to bear fruition. Nothing short of stringent laws to punish the offenders responsible for the destruction of our forests would suffice.
Shocking indeed
The readers of yesterday's newspapers no doubt would have reacted with shock and revulsion to learn that a school principal, no less, had molested one of his female pupils. According to the story, the principal had visited the girl's home several times and had also been in constant contact with her over the telephone. An aunt who had accidentally visited the home had caught the principal in the act.
One often read of school teachers sexually abusing their charges. But this is perhaps the first occasion that a principal had gotten himself into hot water. In another news item it was reported that a security guard of a school in Kuliyapitiya was caught selling drugs to outsiders, during school hours. Which begs the question as to where our schools, and more importantly, this country is heading towards.

Proteas keen to protect away record
From South Africas view point they are bound to come at the Lankans hard at the SSC wanting to preserve their new found impressive record away from home. Since August 2016 South Africa has lost only one (to England) of their last nine Test series both home and away.
I thought in the first Test, we were quite off the boil in a lot of areas. We have been also a team that starts off late unfortunately. Then we start making better decisions. Hopefully we can do that in this Test match although we know its going to be tough but we are looking forward for the challenge, said Du Plessis at the pre-match press conference.
The record is something that we are proud of. It is never easy winning away from home. When you are coming to the sub-continent, drawing a series is as good as winning a series. Its tough and thats what the best teams do. We need to get to that number one position in Test cricket. In order to do that, we need to make sure we compete, he said.
Du Plessis put down his batsmens downfall to spin at Galle for not trusting in their defence.
I dont think we are a team that plays spin badly. The thing that let us down in the first Test was that we didnt trust our defence well enough. The important part of playing spin in Test cricket is trusting your defence, said Du Plessis.
Obviously, we need to try and put pressure back on the spinners as well with what you are doing. The guys worked really hard on their game plan and trying to be positive against spin, which is an element of playing spinners well. You have to also trust your defence so thats two parts.
That was the difference how Sri Lanka played spin and how we played spin especially Dimuth Karunaratne, who didnt take too many risks. He just played with good defence. If you take him away, I think both teams struggled to play spin well. The scores prove that. There werent too many big scores. We take confidence with the fact that from our bowling point of view we did right things apart from that last hour of the first day. We need to try and correct those mistakes.
The great thing about Sri Lankas spin bowlers is that they dont give you too many bad balls. That was evident at how they bowled at us and how we bowled at them. Even though our spinners bowled well, consistency was not as same as Sri Lanka. Landing the ball and making the batsmen take risks. Their bowling was superb and it was on right areas and after some time you feel like taking a risk. For me if you can have two or three options in your game and rest of the time if you make sure your trust your defence thats great. You need to see whether mentally you are tougher than the opposition. That is what we lacked in Galle, he said
Du Plessis said that he expected spin to play a big part at the SSC as well but added, Our weapon has always been pace and I am hoping that rain doesnt play too much of a part in this Test match as I said post match in Galle. You dont want to compete with a soft wet ball all the time. If it doesnt rain, then we will have a dangerous weapon in our fast bowlers. Once again we have to make a call as to whether we are playing three seamers or two spinners.
The wicket looks dry and sometimes there will be assistance for seam bowlers. For me the biggest worry from the first Test was our batting. So probably we will go with the extra batter. That will give us an idea as to how to balance the team.
Dale Steyn is one wicket shy of becoming South Africas leading bowler in Test cricket. His tally currently stands at 421 equal with that of Shaun Pollock.
I will give a kiss on the cheek when he breaks the record, said Du Plessis.

Protests bring Yan Oya Project to a standstill
The construction of the Yan Oya reservoir and its main canals had been interrupted as a result of a string of protests held by residents of the area, with only ninety-eight percent of the headwork (149,000 acre-feet) complete.
A group of villagers had recently trespassed on the Yan Oya Reservoir Project site in protest, blocking the approach roads to the site, while demanding that the construction work be halted. Project officials had then held discussions with the protesters and pledged to provide drinking water by means of bowsers, as well as to construct several wells to counteract the prevailing water scarcity in the district.
However, a section of the protesters disagreed with the proposed solutions and demanded that government officials should meet with them in order to come to an agreement.
The protesters put forward the following demands:
* Immediate payment of compensations for lands acquired
* Immediate payment of compensations for Wahalkada and Kadawala villagers
* Immediate solutions to the existing water shortage
* Immediate payment of compensations for kanna deprivation
Following this, the China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) postponed the construction of the reservoir.

JVP alleges Rs.45 million bribe to Paisley
Rajapaksa-era corruption rocks British Parliament
Rampant corruption during the former Rajapaksa-regime has rocked the British Parliament too and is threatening to undermine the government of Prime Minister Theresa May, according to foreign media reports.
A British MP is likely to lose his seat following revelations that he and his family accepted luxury holidays from the then government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa to defend his dismal human rights record.
Legislator Ian Paisley Jr of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) allied with Mays Conservatives, was yesterday fighting to retain his seat in the House of Commons following an Standards Committee recommendation to suspended him till November.
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake told Parliament yesterday that the Rajapaksa administration had paid in excess of Rs.45 million to entertain the Paisley family in 2013 and demanded an investigation into who instigated the bribe.
There should be an investigation to find out who organised his holiday and who paid for it, Ratnayake said demanding that the authorities launch a fresh probe into the scandal that has rocked the British Parliament.
Paisley, his wife and children flew business class twice to Sri Lanka in 2013. They were provided with a chauffeur-driven Mercedes, helicopter rides and five-star accommodation all paid for by the Sri Lankan government.
After accepting the luxury holidays from Sri Lanka, he had written to the then British Prime Minister David Cameron in defence of Rajapaksas human rights record. Failure to disclose his expensive gifts from Sri Lanka before lobbying the prime minister prompted sanctions against him.
He was found guilty of breaking Westminster rules over luxury trips worth over 100,000 Pounds (Rs.22 million)
The Commons Standards Committee action against Paisley exposes him to the danger of being recalled by his constituents, under legislation passed in 2015, which would trigger a by-election.
In view of the seriousness of this matter, we recommend that Mr. Paisley be suspended from the service of the House for a period of 30 sitting days starting on September 4, 2018, said the standards committee.
His actions amounted to paid advocacy and bring the House of Commons into disrepute, a damning report concluded.
Former President Rajapaksas gofer, Sajin Vass Gunawardena, had arranged several influential foreign dignitaries to visit Sri Lanka and extracted statements from them supporting the country at a time when he faced international isolation.
In Paisleys case, his trips took place in March and July 2013. On the first, he stayed for 10 days and took his entire family. On the second he stayed for seven days and took his wife, Fiona and two of their four children.
The Telegraph newspaper said Sri Lankas Foreign Ministry paid 16,000 Pounds (3.52 million rupees) as their business-class passage. Colombo has also spent another 2.5 million rupees to ferry them in helicopters within the country.

DEBATE ON US$ 7.6 MN  FUNDING REPORT
Rajapaksa's absent, fail to respond
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, his son Namal Rajapaksa and brother Chamal Rajapaksa were conspicuous by their absence in Parliament yesterday when the adjournment debate on the New York Times investigative report was taken up.
Many Government members as well as the JVP accused former President Rajapaksa for undertaking a tour in Singapore dodging an important debate that is directly connected to him.Notably, Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena also chose to be absent despite his name being included in the list of speakers from the JO for yesterdays debate.
MP Gunawardena, who was present in the House earlier on the day, was not present when the Chair read out his name.
JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake said former President Rajapaksa has a duty to attend Parliament and respond to the serious allegation of receiving USD 7.6 million to his polls campaign.
This is a direct accusation against him. I thought that he would remain in the chamber throughout the debate to confront allegations made against him and prove that he was not guilty. On the contrary, we saw how hard the pro-Rajapaksa clan tried to hamper the debate. At least somebody of his family could have come to Parliament and reply on behalf of the former President, he noted.
The MP, commenting on former President Rajapaksas comment that he does not bother to reply to the NYT report as he does not intend to contest an election in the US, said Rajapaksa owes an explanation to the people in Sri Lanka as he had trapped the country in a debt crisis and had endangered the countrys economic and political independence. The country needs an explanation from him not as a former President, a current MP or as a future candidate in elections, but simply as an ordinary citizen of this country. If he is a real citizen, he should have replied without dodging the debate, he added. UNP MP Thushara Indunil, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara and many other UNP members also questioned the absence of the former President and his family members.

Rangajeewas, Ranjans bail plea dismissed
A revision application filed by Police Narcotics Bureau IP Neomal Rangajeewa and former Prisons Department Commissioner Emil Ranjan Lamahewa seeking bail over a magisterial inquiry was yesterday dismissed by the Colombo High Court.
The duo were remanded for allegedly being involved in killing of 27 prisoners during the prison riots which took place at the Welikada prison in 2012.
High Court Judge Champa Janaki Rajaratne rejected the revision petition citing that ongoing investigations into the incident could be hampered if court granted bail on the suspects at this time.
Through the revision application, two suspects sought an order against the Colombo Additional Magistrates refusal to enlarge them on bail and argued that there is no justifiable reason to do so.
Court was informed that IP Neomal Rangajeewa had entered the prison and gathered prisoners by name prior to the killings.

This was disclosed before the Presidential Commission investigating alleged fraud, corruption and misappropriation of state funds and property in SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering Services and Mihin Lanka during its sittings yesterday.

Saved by a cat
I got home and I collapsed on the floor with grief. Awol came downstairs and flopped beside me, trying to comfort me.
The first time I saw Awol was on my doorstep in December 2016. He was super-cute, with black ears, a little white stripe and a fluffy white belly. I would give him a tickle behind the ear and he would rub around my legs to say hello. I had no idea where he came from.
I work shifts for a railway line and even if I got back late he would be waiting. As soon as I pulled into my street, he would follow my car, come strutting up the drive and roll over, wanting his belly tickled. I never fed him and had no intention of taking him in. I had never been a cat person. I always had dogs.
It was my friend who named him Awol. He wasnt microchipped, so we gave him paper collars and put up posters, but no one got in touch.
He visited my house every day for three months. Every time I shut the door I could see him through the glass, staring up at me; he would meow for ages, trying to come in. It was heartbreaking. So, in March 2017, I decided to take him in.
I was slightly worried at first, because I have a cockatiel called Shitehawk. I have had him 15 years and didnt want a Sylvester and Tweety scenario, but they got on fine. Awol was nervous initially, wandering around sniffing everything. The next minute, he was zooming around the house full pelt.
I have a three-bedroom house and live alone, so gave him free rein. He picked the spare room, but after a few weeks gravitated to sleeping in my bed. He was very vocal and liked you to know he was in the room, even at three in the morning.
I had no idea how to look after a cat. Awol was quite fussy and it took a while to find food that didnt upset his tummy. My friend got him a litter box with a flap so he could have his privacy; once he got the hang of that we had him microchipped and flea-treated.
I took in Awol around the time my grandmother, 80, whom I called Nannan, went into hospital. The following day, after work, my mother told me to drive straight to the hospital. I knew it wasnt good. When I got there, she was in the resuscitation room with my mum and grandad. We were all upset. She was my best friend.
I held her hand and said: Nannan, Ive got a cat, and my grandad said: What the bloody hell have you got that for In a strange way, it broke the tension.
I dont know if she heard me, but I think Nannan would have liked Awol. She passed away that night. I got home and collapsed on the floor with grief; I was so upset I could barely breathe. Awol came downstairs and flopped beside me, trying to comfort me. He threw himself on me with such force that it almost stopped my tears.
Shortly after, I went to visit my other grandmother in her care home. I told her I had got a cat and took Awol in to show her, on a lead. The look on her face was priceless. A couple of months later, her brother died and then she also passed away. I lost three friends around the same time; one was expected, but the other two were a shock. At one point I went to three funerals in a week. It was horrific.
I had lost six family members and friends, one of whom Id known since childhood, in the space of four months.
The stress became so much that I sank into a depression and couldnt work. My hair started to fall out. Awol helped me through. He would lie beside me, purring his head off, offering his paw. It was as if he knew. He gave me the push to get out of bed  even feeding him felt like an achievement. After four months, I went back to work. Every time I got home, Awol would be sitting in the window, watching out for me. He was like my little guardian angel. My hair is growing back now and Awol has made it to the finals of Cat Protections National Cat awards. I nominated him and he beat hundreds of other entries to be one of three contenders in the Most Caring Cat category.
Even my grandad has taken to him. He always says: Bloody cat! But when he thinks no one is looking, he is fluffing Awol behind his ear. Awol gave me a reason to get up, to smile and to cope.
I really dont know how I would have got through the past year without him.

Royal fans claim Princess Charlotte looks JUST like her late grandmother as a child in family portraits taken on Prince Louis christening day
She has her likeness to the Queen pointed out on many occasions but royal fans have spotted Princess Charlotte's uncanny resemblance to another of royal relative.
Following her appearance at Prince Louis' christening royal watchers have pointed out the similarities between three-year-old Charlotte and her late grandmother Princess Diana.
Instagram account loveprincessdiana shared a photo of Lady Di at a similar age to her granddaughter that appeared in her passport as a child.
One wrote, 'Charlotte is her mini me!' while another added 'Exactly the same!'
Another commented: 'I have been saying for a while now - Charlotte is going to look a lot more like Diana than anyone thinks...'
However, others agreed that it was their mouths that were identical in the two photos rather than their eyes.
'Look at the lips in both these pictures. Those are almost identical.' commented one royal fan. However, others were still insistent that Charlotte resembles her great-grandmother, the Queen the most.
Royal watchers first commented on how much young Charlotte looks like the Queen, following the release of the Cambridge's Christmas card in December last year.
It was also noted that the pictures of Charlotte taken at her nursery in January show her looking like her great-great-grandmother, the late Queen Mother, as well as her own mother the Duchess of Cambridge at the same age.
And it's not just members of the royal family that Charlotte has previously been compared to - with some social media users spotting an uncanny resemblance to TV presenter Kirstie Allsop.

SL - India joint venture to run Mattala airport
The government will enter into a joint venture with the Indian government to turn the debt ridden Mattala Rajapaksa International airport (MRIA) into a profitable venture.
State Finance Minister Eran Wickremaratne said the agreement to be signed this year would see the expenditures split into 30% for Sri Lanka while the rest will be borne by the Indian government.
This agreement would last for a period of 40 years and would be a purely commercial venture, he said. Through this joint venture we will be dividing our losses which the exchequer struggles to meet today while also increasing our dividends. He said a company would be set up following the joint venture and would lay out the business plan for the project. The Minister declined to go into details adding that since this is a purely commercial venture, confidential details pertaining to the business plan could not be divulged.
He said the MRIA airport was built in a location that has no demand for a airport, domestic or international. When I inquired from the immigration counter, during the first year of operation, they had stamped only one passport, he said.
The only airline which operated out of the airport also pulled out and SriLankan Airlines hardly routed to that route.

S.L.B. ROSA - the double gold medalist marvel at the 1976 Asian Games
If the Initials SLB were meant to read Sri Lanka's Best then in 1970's it was surely a reference to SLB ROSA . He was really the best athlete that Sri Lanka produced. And deservedly he took the country and Asia by storm.
As a long distance runner SELLAPPULIYAGE LUCIAN BENEDICT ROSA  aka  S.L.B. ROSA was a long distance running marvel. Like his Ethiopian and Kenyan brothers he came from the hinterland. Ampitiya was his birthplace. And from those humble beginnings he rewrote the history books of Sri Lankan athletics when running barefoot and winning the 5,000 and 10,000 metre events at the 1970 Asian Games in Bangkok,Thailand. He created an Asian Games record in the 10,000 metre event.
In lighter vein, the story goes that when ROSA would run up and down the winding roads of Ampitiya, no one dared to challenge him and it was left for the stray dogs to chase after him. And then the people in the nearby boutiques kades would chime in aptly with the perennial :  ROSA polla genang, balla maranta and Hinguru kothamali genna ROSA'!
ROSA at the Asia Games at the same venue in 1966 won the bronze medals in the 5,000 and 10,000 metres and bettered it by winning gold in both events in 1970. His best personal timing was 29.18.0 which was a national record.
Munich Olympic Games
ROSA also ran in the marathon at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, West Germany. ROSA led the Sri Lankan team that comprised Sunil Gunawardena and W.Wimaladasa. At these Games former champion runner UPALI GOONERATNE, uncle of LALITH ATHULATHMUDALI also a champion athlete and the writer were the guests of the West German Government and watched ROSA in action in the marathon.
Montreal Games boycott
ROSA failed to run at the 1976 Montreal Games with Sri Lanka deciding to boycott the games. He was unfortunate not to run in at the Mexican Games because Sri Lanka sent only a three-man squad due to financial constraints.It was sad on this great marathon runner who would have left his mark had he been sent.
ROSA hailing from Ampitiya was an old boy of Roman Catholic School where he took to the track showing his potential in long distance running winning the five mile road race organized by Dharmaraja College, Kandy. After that running and winning trophies came naturally to him.
On leaving school ROSA enlisted with the Army as a Private and kept up his winning streak setting up records in the 1,500, 5,000 and 10,000 metre in all three events at the Inter-Unit Army meets and Defence Services meets. He was fortunate to have former long distance champion runner in Linus Diaz as his coach.
Put to second best
ROSA then made everyone stand up and take notice when he put to second best Sri Lankas long distance runner R.J.K.Karunananda in the National championships. Although his rivals were Karunananda, A.W.Aloysius, Wimalsena Perera and the sensations from Bandarawela brothers A.S.M. and A.L.M. Khan.
It did not take long for ROSA to be crowned king of long distance running when he ran sans spikes on a modern track. He set up records in the 10,000 event clocking 29.55.6 and finishing the 5,000 in 14.32.2. ROSA also ran in the prestigious Boston Marathon in 1976 and performed
creditably, coming in fourth with a time of 2.15.4 seconds which was a first by a Sri Lankan athlete.
OSAS brilliance
After watching ROSAS brilliance at the Asian Games in Bangkok the Director of the University of Wisconsin Park, US Roshan Ditch and Bob Lawson their athletics coach offered ROSA a scholarship to do a Business Management and Coaching Certificate Course from 1970 to 74 and he successfully completed the course.
ROSA running in the World Championship Marathon in Japan finished seventh with a time of 2.13.14 seconds. After quitting the track that he loved most, he took to coaching of the University of Wisconsin and was later promoted as Cross Country and Track and Field Coach of the University.
ROSAS magnificent effort at the Asian Games in Bangkok in 1976 where he won two gold medals in the 5,000 and 10,000 metre events will not be equaled or bettered and will stand the test of time.
Self made athlete
When will there be another athlete of the class of S.L.B. ROSA He was a self made record breaking athlete and he set an example for other athletes to follow. It was a pity that ROSAS expertise was lost to the country.
This account will not be complete without mention of the incident when the writer was watching the Munich Olympics in 1972 brings to mind the nightmarish and frightening experience UPALI and the writer suffered when
terrorists styling themselves BLACK SEPTEMBER struck invading the quarters of the Israeli athletes and gunning some of them down in cold blood during the Games. The Games were not the same after that inhuman experience and there was fear all round not knowing what was going to happen next. The Israeli athletes were unfortunate to suffer murder. Why the terrorists had to vent
their anger on the innocent Israeli athletes by invading their quarters and causing death and destruction was inexplicable and unforgivable.
Black September terror attack 
It later transpired that the BLACK SEPTEMBER group that struck had worked in that very building that was being constructed to house the Israeli contingent and the terrorists had no difficulty in finding the quarters. The attack group had entered the Games Village posing off asathletes with kit bags and track suits to boot and had no difficulty in fooling the security and gaining entry.
The BLACK SEPTEMBER killing group that showed mans inhumanity to man were despots. The Games were not the same again and it was the first time that terrorists had struck at a sports event. GOONERATNE and the writer experienced fear for the first time and were counting the days when we would be flying back home.
The Americans who were stunned by the murders quickly whisked away the swimming sensation MARK SPITZ who was dominating the pool winning events with consummate ease and taking the swim events by storm.

## Title: Trailblazing Poster Couple

Trailblazing Poster Couple
AAs the beautifully streamlined passenger liner sails slowly out of the harbour, a chic curvaceous blonde looks back from her elegantly seated position, with perfect poise and balancing a long black cigarette holder like an artist framing her next painting, while he stands beside her, in dark contoured smartness with sharp shoulders while resting his hand on the smooth side-rail. Both are filled with deep nostalgia as they watch the twinkling multicoloured lights of the harbour blinking into the distance for the last time, slowly disappearing with their former dreams, to be replaced by hopes re-ignited on another isle. The couple, while heralding from a by-gone age, could easily be poster couple, Meg and Phil on their way from Galle Fort, Sri Lanka to set up a European Gallery in Mallorca.
This enigmatic duo created Stick No Bills, an international enterprise specialising in reviving, glamorising and immortalising such pivotal moments in time, where lovers with a passion for adventure conducted themselves with effortless grace and poise, when there was a clear idea of gender perfection and where nothing penetrated beneath the cool, calm and collected appearances of those blazing social trails across the globe in spectacular vessels of travel. Such posters depict the heady days of steam locomotives and tramcars passing by clean and unpopulated beaches; ocean liners traversing unpolluted oceans while their human cargo indulged their every passion on board; and curvaceous convertible automobiles that seem to describe the contours of the wind as it passes over and around them and their uber cool passengers while they race along empty roads.
I try to create pre-digital and pre-mass tourism era images that allow travellers to take home a poster that is a flash-back to the holiday they wish they had had; not of the unimaginative package tour and/or rental-car-company-plundered holiday many of them may have in fact actually had.
The current genre, Meg and Phil are working on, is 1930s art deco style cruise ship tour designs featuring strong females empowered to travel alone. 'Maybe she is looking for solitude. Maybe she is looking for love' - the ultimate femme fatale.
Phil meticulously researches every design the art directs, to create a resounding sense of place, detailing the range of surrounding topography, the architecture in keeping with the time and the fashions and styles of dressing, all the way to accurately depicting the local fauna and flora and seasonal fruits of the area. Every image, whether vintage or retro, freezes a moment in time and the process of creating it is a great story in itself. One day we will find the time to reveal all these stories in a beautiful book, Phil says, before telling me about how they put together a best-selling scene of a Mallorcan tram by the sea, explaining that the tram looks serene in the poster when in reality it is always jam-packed with tourists. This might be why Stick No Bills posters are described in the world's leading glamour magazines like Vogue, Conde Nast and Architectural Digest as impossibly stylish and aspirational.
But life in this business has not been a bed of roses for the couple. Although both regions have, overall been welcoming and receptive to their entrepreneurial efforts, there have, for example, been concerted efforts to undermine them, including serious violations of their intellectual property rights in Sri Lanka which they had to crush, through filing indisputable objections in the countrys Supreme Court. This is in spite of the consequences for such infringements being so grave.
If anyone infringes copyright granted under the IP Act (from making unauthorised copies of a protected work to selling unauthorised copies), then he/she has committed a punishable offence  and will be liable to pay a fine of up to Rs.500,000/- or be imprisoned for up to 6 months, or both. If they are repeat offenders, then the punishment (both fine and jail term) can be doubled. (S.178). In any case, the Magistrate can order any unlawful copies and the tools and implements used to make such copies be destroyed or returned to the copyright owner, as the Magistrate sees fit, said Nipuni R. Samarasekara an Attorney-at-Law with an MSc in Law and Finance from Queen Mary, University of London.
Meg states, We learnt the hard way that there is truth in the truism if it doesnt kill you, it will make you stronger. It is our personal belief that if you respect and obey the law to the letter, you are passionate about what you do, you work hard, treat all your stakeholders well and keep on innovating, you can thrive no matter how challenging the context."
In deciding where to expand their poster enterprise to next, the surf-fanatic couple explored setting up shop in the epic, travel-poster and wave-rich destinations of Hawaii and Rio. However, the pull of the Balearic peaceful, laid-back and sophisticated way of life, the beauty of the islands, their incredible heritage and the education system they offered for their jungle-bred daughters, drew them to choose Mallorca as the perfect spot in which to begin replicating the formula, they developed in Asia, in Europe.
Phil says the four cornerstones of the fast-growing success of Stick No Bills are integrity, originality, quality and innovation. We believe in giving back. So when you buy our posters you help us fund the important philanthropic causes and conservation projects we support. Eight years of painstaking supply chain research and development has enabled us to attain a high quality of product. The challenge is keeping our unique brand ahead of the game in the art market and never letting it slide into the souvenir tat realm. Thats a mug's game and not something we want to be associated with, says Phil.
And the poster favourites The girls tend to go for The Tear because it portrays probably the most handsome man on the planet. Conversely, most guys go for Kiki while more senior men opt for the more curvaceous 1930s figure of Mia. Honeymooners are drawn to Donde Ahora. Megs favourites include Mount Lavinia Beach, 1948, owing to the designs remarkable back story involving a British Governor of Ceylon falling madly in love with a gipsy dancing girl, Lovinia; a controversial romance after which the beach, where Meg first lived in Sri Lanka almost two decades ago, was named.
The exciting opening in Palma this month has more than lived up to the twenty-two month-long search for the ideal location. As soon as you walk into their 145m2 Temple Street flagship gallery you will love the layout, the framing and the feng shui, which, for those who have been to their Galle Fort flag ship gallery, are astonishingly similar. Meg says, Having spent a large part of the last few years fending off image pirates in Asia, there's something ironic about ending up launching Stick No Bills Iberia from a historic building, under the floorboards of which there is a tunnel that leads all the way to the Cathedral and the beach; a tunnel built by our itinerant merchant forbears, for evading guess what Pirate attacks!

UDA recommends one pavilion of Galle stadium be removed
The Urban Development Authority has recommended that one pavilion of the Galle International Stadium be removed in order to comply with the UNESCO regulations on world heritage site as the cricket stadium is bordering the Galle Fort which has been declared as a World Heritage site.
A spokesman for the UDA said that the Galle International Stadium has been located near the Galle Dutch Fort which has been declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO and that the pavilion has been constructed without the approval of a responsible authority.
Several unauthorized constructions in the Galle Fort and its buffer zone pose a danger to the World Heritage site of the Galle Fort.
The Archaeology Departments approval is required to carry out any construction or renovation within a heritage site. From time to time UNESCO has requested us to take action to remove unapproved constructions which have been built within the old Galle Fort and its buffer zone if Galle is to safeguard its heritage listing. It is necessary to take action to safeguard the Old Galle Fort as a UNESCO heritage site, the spokesman added.
Meanwhile, UNESCO has issued a red notice to the government for the urgent removal of unauthorized constructions in and around the Galle Fort in order to protect the Outstanding Value of the World Heritage site of the Old Town of Galle and its fortifications.
Following the assessment carried out by the UDA, it has been revealed that there were many unauthorized constructions in and around Galle Fort. However, the final decision on the Galle International Cricket Stadium has not been taken yet and discussions with the relevant authorities, including the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, Archeological Department, Urban Development Authority and officials of Sri Lanka Cricket and Western Province Cricket Association about this matter is on track.
Meanwhile, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said the problem had arisen with the setting up of this pavilion in the Galle International Stadium without any permission, during the former regime. Even though UNESCO warned earlier to remove this stadium, it was not removed as the former Presidents name was attached to it . We think it will be possible to remove only the unauthorised pavilion and keep the stadium as it is, he stated.

WFP and the Government will continue to address the root causes of food insecurity and malnutrition, while promoting longer-term recovery and resilience for thousands of people.
This includes improving the productivity and incomes of smallholder farmers and vulnerable communities, especially women; ensuring that children receive a vital nutritious meal at school; tackling the underlying causes of high and chronic malnutrition rates; and assisting the government to prepare for and respond to climate shocks.
The five-year plan requires USD 46.8 million, and prioritizes new, dynamic multi-stakeholder partnerships, including with the private sector and civil society, which will be vital to delivering on food security and nutrition priorities and achieving zero hunger in Sri Lanka.
The plan was developed through rigorous and comprehensive process, which included a Country Portfolio Evaluation of the last five years (2012-2016) and a multi-stakeholder strategic consultation of the National Strategic Review of Food Security and Nutrition towards Zero Hunger.

Youth hospitalised following alleged police assault
A youth who had been allegedly assaulted by two officers attached to Hettipola Police, had been admitted to the Chilaw Hospital recently.
The victim had been identified as 19-year-old Kanishka Balasooriya, the son of a late army intelligence captain who was killed in an LTTE suicide bomb attack in 2000.
Balasooriya had been treated at the Kurunegala Hospital for three days, prior to being transferred to the Chilaw Hospital and later, the Colonbo National Hospital, on July 19.
The victims mother, Sudarma Balasooriya, said that they were running a filtered water business. She said her son had been recently abducted by two assailants in his own vehicle, adding that when the vehicle was intercepted by police near Anamaduwa, the suspects had fled the scene, and her son had been subsequently assaulted by the said two police officers. Pallama Police had recently apprehended two suspicious individuals wandering in the Madawakkulama.
However, when they had informed Hettipola Police regarding the arrest, they had dismissed the matter.
When queried, Hettipola Police said that they had no need for the suspects as the relevant police officer was absent at the station, adding that they would investigate it if only someone were to lodge a complaint.
