The man of Unmatched Impact
He never flinched at the sight of trouble. He was dubbed a Hawk by his opponents. His mental faculties were so dazzling that he could negotiate with tough envoys at the time the country needed astute and perceptive diplomacy to take it out of troubled waters and to a safer mooring point. At times, his intellectual power was unimaginable. That was Lalith Athulathmudali, the colossus who ignited the political arena with bright sparks whatever he did.
The Oxford scholar, who gave up his illustrious legal and academic careers to serve the people, was elected to Parliament in 1977 as a UNP MP and soon carved out a niche in the political arena. The brilliant orator well known for his unmatched intelligence and vast knowledge in legal and international affairs was also the first Sri Lankan to be elected as the President of the Oxford Union in 1958. His brilliance was unmatched that his reasoning resonated the star-studded Cabinet of the first executive president of Sri Lanka, J R Jayewardene, where he served as Minister of Trade and Shipping and Minister of National Security. However this erudite politician found himself marginalized by President Jayewardenes successor, Ranasinghe Premadasa, when he was appointed Minister of Agriculture and later Minister of Education and Higher Education.
The pragmatic leader, who firmly believed that education was the only long term solution to poverty, introduced the Mahapola Scholarship Trust fund in 1981 to provide financial assistance to the needy undergraduates. The programme which started with only 400 students continues to benefit millions of university students in the country.
As Minister of Trade and shipping, he introduced Intellectual Property Law, pioneered in establishing Sri Lanka Export Development Board under Sri Lanka Export Development Act No. 40 of 1979 and established the Ports Authority in the same year. As Minister of National Security he was entrusted with the great responsibility of containing the LTTE. However, when the Indo-Lanka Peace Agreement was signed, Minister Athulathmudali expressed his vehement opposition to the idea.
Though the historic and revolutionary move initiated by Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake to bring forth an impeachment motion against the then President Ranasinghe Premadasa, did not succeed due to the complexity of the impeachment process, it well proved the duos political prowess against the incumbent President. Having been expelled from the UNP in 1991 following the impeachment attempt, they formed the DUNF which became the main rival political party of the UNP. He soon became the leader of the new party, but was assassinated at the peak of his political career while addressing the 1993 Provincial Council election campaign rally in Kirulapane.
He left behind a mission unaccomplished, but his political legacy lives on.
Twenty-three years after the brutal assassination that stilled a nation, the Daily News speaks to Lalith Athulathmudalis only daughter Serela Athulathmudali who was barely eleven years, at the time of her fathers death.
Back then she never wondered why her father said so, but his words were ingrained in her little mind!
This will be the last one Duwa, we dont have any more space here, he said soon after she finished planting a fruit tree on his favourite Giriulle estate to mark her birthday. On every birthday her father made sure that she planted a fruit tree on the estate to celebrate the occasion and the last one was planted twenty three years ago!
Years rolled on, and many a tear rolled down her face. She was barely 11-years-old when her father was assassinated at the peak of his political career. Eleven years later when her mother succumbed to her illness, the feeling of loss was unbearably intense that it made her quit her opera singing career.
Today, the much loved daughter of late ministers, Lalith Athulathmudali and Srimani Athulathmudali, sings only for fun when she is at home in Sri Lanka and can join her fellow workshop players or her old friends from Adlib for a while!
I am always asked to enter the political stage, and I always say no. The truth is I do not believe I have what it takes to govern! said Serela Athulahmudali ready to recall the treasured memories she had of her father who undoubtedly possessed many a defining characteristic of a charismatic leader!
The Founder of the Mahapola Scholarship Trust and the illustrious National Security Minister of J R Jayewardene regime would have been 80 now, had he not been brutally assassinated allegedly by the LTTE.
Had he been still alive today and if he felt that he had his part for his people, he would have been happy teaching (lecturing) or just teaching his grandson, Haren, says Serala.
I would have been happy with whichever he had chosen, had he been alive, she added.
Memories
Even though her stay with her father was brief, wisps of memories came floating by as she turned back the cherished pages of her golden days spent under the loving care of her father.
I suppose my earliest memory of my father was him saying to my mother Serela is too tired to say paan to which I would respond paan!
It was because of her father that she learned to treat everyone with dignity. In the short time I had with him he taught me that everyone deserved dignity.
Dignity of labour is important, he used to tell her often. I didnt understand exactly what he meant by it at the time, but as the years passed, it is the lesson that has stuck with me the most, Serela emphasized.
Her fathers Sinhala lessons offered her a good opportunity to develop an interest in languages.
Thaththis Sinhala lessons would often go off on a tangent to where the word came from and what its origins were. My Amma used to say I learnt a lot from Thaththi, but that Sinhala wasnt one of them! My Sinhala teachers could attest to that. But his lessons were fascinating. I learnt to love languages from him - to see them as something living - that is always evolving, she reminisced.
Way back in the late eighties Serela went to school in the car with her parents.
She still remembers how her father always had a newspaper or map on his lap while in the car.
I remember he would take up more than half the back seat and Ammi and I would squeeze into the rest which was not fun for Ammi as I was not a skinny child! Thaththi would give me lessons on Sri Lankan history and legends and Buddhism. I remember being scared witless by Anguli Maale! she recalled.
Serela took a stroll down memory lane as she recalled how they used to go to Gangaramaya to engage in religious practices way back in the late eighties and early nineties.
But we would never go on Poya days because my father would say it was too full and he was afraid he would lose me in the crowd! We would recite a small Gaatha together at home if he was there, she added.
Her father, a staunch Buddhist, taught her how to bestow Metta (loving-kindness) on all living beings. Siyalu Sathwayo Niduk Wethwa, Nirogi Wethwa, Dhuken Midethwa, Nivan Dhakithwa. Saadu, the way her father used to narrate these lines with her before retiring to bed is still etched in her mind. Today my son is learning it too.
However she does not remember if her father ever taught her all the Gathas.
I have a much stronger memory of his sister Sujaee repeating all the Gathas with me,
Highest award
Seralas mother late Srimani Athulathmudali who served as Minister of Transport, Environment and Womens Affairs in the then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas Peoples Alliance government, once stated that the highest award which her husband had gifted her and her daughter would be the confidence of self-exertion!
Serela was so quick to agree with her mothers words. My father cast a long shadow. In truth, I spent most of my life afraid of trying new things as I was afraid to fail and disappoint him or his memory. If there is one thing he inspired it is my curiosity about the world and cultures and languages. He would give me lessons sometimes and he would always go off course to explain little details such as the origin of a word or what other things were happening during a certain historical event, she explained.
Erudite politicians of Athulathmudalis calibre are extremely rare in todays political arena. He is best remembered for his outstanding contribution to higher education through introducing the Mahapola Scholarship Fund in 1981 which supports the financially needy undergraduates throughout their university life. If not for his far-sighted vision many an undergraduate would not have been able to attain their higher education dreams. It was his belief that enhancing education was the only long term solution to eradicate poverty.
Not many are aware of the sensitive, personal story that propelled Minister Athulathmudali to introduce the Mahapola concept. Back in the fifties Athulathmudali had completed his MA in law at Oxford and was studying for his BCL when his father died. College expenses being so high, his mother was left with no other option, but to recall him. Lalith, however, was not ready to give up. He presented his case to the then Prime Minister S W R D Bandaranaike who took immediate measures to present a proposal to Parliament and grant him a Scholarship of Rs 5,000. Come back and serve your country, Premier Bandaranaike told him.
Not only did he return to the country to take up politics, but also he introduced the Mahapola concept which continues to benefit many a student keen to accomplish their higher education dreams.
This visionary politician who wholeheartedly wished to see a country filled with intellectuals, however, did not live long to see his own daughter achieve her goals in education. Serala has a faint memory of her father handing over the best Orator Trophy to her at the Trinity College Award ceremony held in the late eighties.
I dont really remember much about that day except for being very nervous about having to recite a poem out loud in front of him and my mother, but I do remember that when he handed me the award, the smile on his face was all that I could see, she recalled.
She still vaguely remembers her father explaining to her what it meant to be the president of the country!
He told me once that to be President meant that you were the peoples servant. That even a beggar on the street had the right to tell you what to do. I dont know if he really believed it himself, but I never heard him being disrespectful to anyone when I was near, she added.
Anxiety and tension prevailed throughout the country when Ministers Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake decided to produce an impeachment motion against the then President Premadasa, having been disgusted by his autocratic rule.
As the attempt failed, the duo, along with five others, were expelled from the party, and finally the DUNF was formed under the leadership of Lalith Athulathmudali.
However Serala was too small to recall the happenings at home. She only has faint memories of her father saying how important it was for President Premadasa to be removed.
The people of the country kept utmost faith in the duo and many expected that they would work together to usher in a new era of democratic dominance.
Serelas memories of those tension-filled days are faint.
I honestly do not remember seeing Mr. Dissanayake that much, but who would want a young child underfoot when discussing things of national importance
She only has blurry memories of lots of adults running around her fathers office at Flower Terrace.
Other than that all I remember is moving out of one place and into another, she added.
Photograph
The adorable daughter of Minister Athulathmudali drew everyones attention wherever she visited with her parents. The photograph of President Premadasa helping little Serela to read a book that was published in a newspaper in the early nineties, grabbed everyones attention for its sheer cuteness.
The Daily News asked Serela whether she could recall the days she visited the then President Premadasa who was soon to become her fathers main political rival!
I do, but not because of visiting the President. I was running around after being told not to and bumped into someone who was carrying Kirihodhi, which then landed all over my brand new white dress!
Stored in her memory bank are the holidays she spent with her parents. Still more than twenty five years on, the holidays with fathers cousin Surath Wickramasinha, long stay at the house of his friend Jeeva Ganepola n New Jersey and many visits from Gamini Correa, Siri Fernando, Aruna Siriwardene, Cedric and Sita De Silva and Mano Chamugan are etched firmly in her memory.
She also recalled the days they spent on the Giriulle estate and holidays with family friends in Hong Kong.
Our last trip together as a family was to Scotland and I remember very clearly a trip on a ferry and a rather disgusting cheese sandwich! she added.
His speeches were superb efforts of oratory for as long as he spoke he would always keep his audiences spell bound. Serela was too small back then to visit Parliament to see her father speak. She says she does not remember hearing him speak.
Of his numerous political friends she only remembers Kesaralal Gunasekera.
You can ask him, hell tell you, I was a terribly precocious child!, she added.
Work unfinished
Lalith Athulathmudali contributed immensely to bring about favourable changes in the political, economic and social life in the country. After forming the DUNF, the first task was to contest the Provincial Council elections. He was gunned down in Kirulapane while addressing a rally during his campaign to become the Chief Minister of the Western Province. The news sent shockwaves across his home, across the country. He died with his mission unaccomplished, but the highest number of preferences he polled despite his death, bear testimony to his immense popularity. Thousands of mourners thronged his residence and the then government even feared an uprising of his allies.
Though she was barely 11 years at the time of her fathers death, her memories of those grief-struck days remain sharp and clear. The great pain and confusion she experienced when he was brutally murdered still haunts her memory.
I remember my mother was heart- broken and my uncle Dayantha was angry, she recalled.
Serela calls her father a great politician in the true sense of the word because he genuinely cared about the people.
When it comes to Thaththi, he was a great politician because he genuinely cared about the people.
We could talk about how well he spoke or his intelligence, but the simple fact is that, without an actual desire to see the people do well, those things mean nothing, she said.
To this day, Serela vividly remembers the way her father treated the people, giving importance to each of them.
Thaththi had a way of making people feel important, of finding people who could do a good job, she reminisced.
Oxford days
Athulathmudali had his primary education at St. Johns College, Panadura, before moving to Royal College Colombo. Having won the Steward Prize, he entered prestigious Oxford University to pursue his higher studies in 1955 and made his motherland proud by being the first Sri Lankan to be elected as the President of the Oxford Union in 1958. He obtained B.A. (Jurisprudence) from Oxford and enrolled as a Barrister of Grays Inn. He did his LLM at the University of Harvard. This illustrious scholar also served as a law lecturer at the University of Singapore, Hebrew University in Israel, University of Edinburgh in UK and Ceylon Law College. In 1985 he was appointed a Presidents Counsel.
Serela cannot remember her father ever talking to her about his school days or Oxford days.
But still I hear about his school days from his brother or sister, but I dont remember him ever telling me about them. I do remember finding an old report card of his which had an F for music with the phrase good for words, singing no tune written next to it!
At the time of his death, Serala had not seen him for nearly two weeks as he was too busy with the impeachment.
The last time I remember seeing Thaththi during this period was when he was attacked by someone wielding a bat I believe and he had hurt his ankle. He laughed and said I was trying to see if I could still jump a hurdle and my Amma who was bandaging his leg looked up and said hes forgetting how old he is to which he responded with a laugh.
Mother's decision
Her mother Srimani Athulathmudali who later led the DUNF founded by her husband was elected to Parliament in 1994.
However Serela never encouraged her mothers decision of taking up politics. She said she did not ever wish to see her mother following in her fathers footsteps. But Srimani was determined to carry on her late husbands legacy.
I did not want my mother to follow my fathers footsteps. I tried to convince her to return to her job in Switzerland. I even used the words I had heard my father say many, many, times when people joked that I should become a politician one politician per family is enough She chose not to listen to me! she said.
Cherishing all the memories of the distant past, Serala who resides abroad, smiles at future with courage. She currently makes a line of toys.
It is inspired by my son and made by me, but it is not a large enterprise at the moment.
Serela added that her son is very proud of being Sri Lankan even though his father is Brazilian.
He wants to come back home. He knows that his grandfather was a politician and that he was assassinated. He always asks if they have caught the assassin yet to which I have to tell him no! she finally noted with a tinge of nostalgia and regret.

The Bourse gained 31 points since last Friday, hitting one year closing high to end at 6671.98 points - helped gaining a 7.1% Y-T-D. Average turnover levels meanwhile were hovering around LKR 0.67Bn during the holiday shortened week (9% decline W-o-W) as investors were relatively muted during this week. Large parcels in Teejay Lanka (22% of the total crossings), DFCC (18% of the total crossings), Hemas Holdings (16% of the total crossings) helped extend the HNI and Institutional contribution to turnover as total crossings accounted for 33% of total market turnover.
Foreign investors continued to remain net buyers for the 14th consecutive week as net inflows increased by 18% W-o-W to LKR 0.21Bn bringing the total net inflows for the year to LKR 16.21Bn.
Similar market momentum is likely in the week ahead and could to be influenced by the direction of Mar17 corporate earnings.
May policy ratesheld steady
The Central Bank at its May policy meeting held policy rates steady citing a deceleration of both inflation and private sector credit and improved balance of payment.
(Repo: 7.25%, Reverse Repo: 8.75%). Despite NCPI edging up to 8.6% in March 17 (cf.2.2% in Mar16) which was largely due to drought and VAT impact, CBSL projects the inflation to remain in the desired mid-single digit levels by end of 2017 supported mainly by the Monitory policy adjustments which was followed since end 2015 (policy rates were increased by 125bps since Feb16 to date while the SRR was increased to 7.5% from 6%).
Conversely CBSL also estimate the private sector credit to slow down by end of 2017 to the envisaged levels, as the credit levels showed signs of deceleration from its peak in July16 of 28.5% Y-o-Y to 21.9% in Dec16, and further declining to 20.4% in Mar17 with the upward adjustment in rates.
The monetary authority also added that its policy stance was supported by projected inflows from both government securities market and CSE in addition to the 11th International Sovereign Bond issued worth US$ 1.5Bn. Further disbursement of the 3rd tranche under IMF Extended Fund Facility too is expected to support the BOP and reserve position of Sri Lanka.

Mumbai finish on top; Kolkata qualify
KOLKATA: Kolkata Knight Riders were assured of a playoff berth even before the first ball of their last league match against Mumbai Indians was bowled at the Eden Gardens after Sunrisers Hyderabad made the last four by winning their final game in an earlier match on Saturday.
But the Kolkata outfit suffered a moral jolt ahead of the playoffs as they went down by nine runs to a secondstring Mumbai side in their own den. The win helped Mumbai top the league table with 20 points while Kolkata (16 points) can only finish third or fourth and will play the eliminator against either Rising Pune Supergiant or Kings XI Punjab, who will clash on Sunday.
Assured of a top-two finish before the match started, Mumbai Indians decided to test their bench strength and made six changes for their last league match. The newcomers did not disappoint as opener Saurabh Tiwary anchored the innings well and Ambati Rayudu struck a quickfire half-century down the order to help the visitors put up 173 for five after being asked to bat first by Gautam Gambhir. A Nor'wester, followed by a sharp shower late in the afternoon, delayed the start of play by half an hour. Kolkata made the mistake of opening with Sunil Naraine and Chris Lynn on a slow pitch. Narine was out to the fourth ball of the innings, caught at mid-off by Hardik Pandya off Tim Southee. Kolkata then lost skipper Gambhir (21), Robin Uthappa (2) and Chris Lynn (26) and Yusuf Pathan (20) and slumped to 87 for five. However, a 31-ball 41-run run sixth wicket stand between Manish Pandey and Colin de Grandhomme raised hopes of a comeback for the hosts before Hardik Pandya cut one back to dislodge Grandhomme's stumps.
Pandya was instrumental in pushing the last nail in Kolkata's coffin when he had Pandey caught at deep mid-wicket for a run-a-ball 33 in the 18th over.  TNN

Nadal ends Djokovic hoodoo to reach another Madrid final
MADRID, Saturday - A red hot Rafael Nadal ended a seven-match losing streak against Novak Djokovic in emphatic fashion by thrashing the world number two 6-2 6-4 on Saturday to reach the final of the Madrid Open and move within a step of a third consecutive claycourt title.
The Spaniard will be aiming for a fifth Madrid title when he meets Austrian Dominic Thiem in Sunday's showpiece.
World number nine Thiem beat Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas 6-4 6-4 in the other semi-final.
Nadal got off to a dream start in the 50th meeting between the two great rivals, winning every point in the first game to break Djokovic, with the home crowd wildly celebrating his first point - a potent return which the Serbian could only hit into the ground.
Djokovic won the last meeting between the pair in the quarter-finals of the Rome Masters a year ago, and Nadal had not beaten the 12-times grand slam winner since the 2014 French Open final.
The circumstances nowadays are completely different compared to those seven matches that occurred before. The last two years perhaps haven't been my best two years.
They were really good years for Novak, Nadal told a news conference.
However, the Spaniard added: It's one more match. What's important to me is to make it to another final.
As years go by, depending on the type of victories, (they) can fulfil you a little bit more or less. The most important thing is the titles, not the opponents that you have beaten.
Defending champion Djokovic, who cut ties with long-time coach Marian Vajda and his staff the week before the tournament in a bid to reverse his downward trajectory of results, surrendered his serve again in the third game, and Nadal held to go 4-0 up.
Real Madrid greats Raul and Cristiano Ronaldo were among those watching in the stands in the Caja Majica on a scorching day in the Spanish capital as Nadal continued his rampant start to the year.
The Spaniard finished off the first set in 40 minutes and again broke the struggling Djokovic in the opening game of the second. The world number two broke back in the fourth to tie the set at 2-2 and celebrated by punching the air.
It proved to be just a brief respite for the Serbian, however, as Nadal broke him again in the next game and held to restore his two-game lead.
He missed two match points on his serve and then had to save a break point before taking the contest at the third time of asking to reach the Madrid final for the eighth time. On Sunday, Nadal will look to add to his recent triumphs in the Monte Carlo Masters and the Barcelona Open.
Djokovic said he was encouraged by his performance.
It was really good to play in the semi-finals of a big event, and to play against one of the top rivals I have in my life. I haven't had that feeling in months, so it's great to feel that, Djokovic said.
It was a positive week, a positive experience. I take, as I say, more positives than negatives into the next week in Rome.

Nanayakkara addresses over 200 young graduates
An industry stalwart addressed over 200 young graduates on the future opportunities in the Travel & Tourism Industry at the recently concluded Sancharaka Udawa at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall.
Nilmin Nanayakkara, Managing Director, NKAR Travels & Tours (Pvt) Ltd made this presentation to well over 200 university students who have expressed their keenness to join the Travel and Tourism Industry.
The Sacharaka Udawa was held for the seventh year in succession and the Chief Organizer of the event was Dirk Grigson supported by a team of members from the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO).
It was well evident that during the presentation made by Nanayakkara on the subject Career Opportunities in the Hospitality Industry in Sri Lanka the well over 200 young educated university graduates and students did not know the opportunities that existed in the travel industry.
They truly understood the value of joining the Travel and Tourism Industry after this 45 minute presentation, said Nanayakkara.
The presentation was based on 3 scenarios: starting from the Global trends and the positive movement to Asia Pacific and the continuous growth of SAARC, simultaneously showing Sri Lanka as having the fastest growth in the SAARC region.
Thereafter he went on to show the comparative strengths and growth of Tourism in Sri Lanka from 2010 to 2015, and with this the audience was highly taken up with the opportunities. From there he very creatively got into the audience to make them feel and showed them the high pedestal on which they could be in by joining the Travel and Tourism Industry. He further carved out the global opportunities for well experienced Tourism personnel in Sri Lanka.
From the applause he received and the response of the students it was very evident that Sancharaka Udawa and the presentation Nanayakkara made on Career Opportunities in the Hospital Industry in Sri Lanka certainly attracted lots of educated, dynamic university students and graduates and lured them into joining the Travel and Tourism Industry. This will certainly be well looked forward to by the local Destination Management Companies and all Hoteliers.

Number of duty free vehicle permits reduced: Ravi
The number of duty free vehicle permits has been cut down and only the most needed people currently receive them, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister was addressing a press conference at his ministry premises yesterday.
The minister was responding to a journalist who wanted to know the Ministers stance over the litigation by Attorney-at-law Nagananda Kodituwakku on the Rs 7 billion alleged loss caused by the alleged sale of duty free vehicle permits by parliamentarians.
Kodituwakku is acting as if he had woken up after a deep slumber. Those days about 30,000 duty free vehicle permits were granted, but now we have reduced this number to about 5,000.
Not only the MPs, but also the public servants and those in the Supreme Court also receive them. It is with hypocrisy that he(Kodituwakku) has only highlighted about the MPs.
Why did he not make the same allegation when duty free permits were given out to many. Minister Karunanayake asserted.
The minister said publishing the names of those who had sold their permits would put an end to the matter.

One Belt, One Road
More than 2,000 years ago, Chinas imperial envoy Zhang Qian helped to establish the Silk Road, a network of trade routes that linked China to Central Asia and the Arab world. The name came from one of Chinas most important exportssilk. And the road itself influenced the development of the entire region for thousands of years. Fifth Century Chinese traveller FaHsein gives a good account of this link in his travelogues, along with a detailed description of then Sri Lanka.
In 2013, Chinas President Xi Jinping, proposed establishing a modern equivalent, creating a network of railways, roads, pipelines, and utility grids that would link China and Central Asia, West Asia, and parts of South Asia. China is hosting a global summit today on this biggest ever infrastructure project in the world - the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative that will eventually link 68 Asian, European and African countries (including Sri Lanka) and 4.5 billion people. Sri Lanka is being represented at the OBOR summit by a delegation led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
OBOR, more formally known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), is a complex infrastructure plan that will link Europe to the Far East, based on the ancient Silk Road trade route. The project, for which US$ 1 trillion has already been earmarked, has two components  land and maritime. Sri Lanka is included in the maritime category.
According to the Chinese Government, OBOR is about the free flow of people, goods, trade, capital and ideas. This flow can only come about when the countries, the people and the economies are highly connected by roads, rail, aviation, trade, investment, banking and finance. The land segment (named the Silk Road Economic Belt) will run from London to Xian (or beyond) via Moscow, Istanbul, Tehran, Samarkand, Almaty, Urumqi and Lanzhou while the maritime route (21st Century maritime Silk Road) will stretch from Rotterdam to Fuzhou via Venice, Athens, Colombo/Hambantota, KL, Jakarta, Hanoi and Guangzhou. This is only a broad outline and one of several proposed routes. Nothing is written in stone, so cities could be added or deleted. Moreover, country-specific infrastructure projects such as the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur High Speed Railway (slated for completion by 2026) could benefit from or even become part of OBOR. A number of projects are already underway, including a train line from China to Iran that may be expanded to Europe. There are also new rail links with Laos and Thailand and high-speed-rail projects in Indonesia.
Formally, OBOR emphasizes five key areas of cooperation: coordinating development policies, forging infrastructure and facilities networks, strengthening investment and trade relations, enhancing financial cooperation and deepening social and cultural exchanges. Incidentally, the aims of the Medium and Long-term Development Plan for Investment, Economic and Technological Cooperation that China and Sri Lanka will be signing during the Lankan Premiers visit have similar objectives. The projects under this pact will include section one of the Central Expressway and the Ruwanpura Expressway, two vital infrastructure projects.
From a purely infrastructural and investment point of view, this project will revitalize much of Asia and also parts of Africa and Europe. While some countries will no doubt harbour doubts about Chinas ambitions, there is no denying that the project will enhance connectivity and trade across Asia. This will be especially beneficial to developing countries that cannot finance massive infrastructure projects on their own.
Sri Lanka has not fully realised its potential as a strategically-positioned island between Dubai and Singapore, the two regional economic centres. Sri Lanka must promote itself as the gateway to India, with its one billion plus market. In this context, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has outlined the reasons for creating a North-South link, an investment corridor through Sri Lanka. Sri Lankas situation in the nautical corridor between the East and West is of import not only from a geostrategic perspective, but also from maritime economic and security perspectives. On the one hand, the Indian Ocean is a vast source of maritime economic resources, on the other; it is a maritime trading corridor through which nearly two thirds of the worlds oil is transported, he noted recently.
The Chinese-funded Colombo International Financial Centre (Port City), whose terms were amended to be more favourable to Sri Lanka after this Government came to power, will be a catalyst for economic growth and greater international trade. The Port project at Hambantota, against which factions of the Opposition carried out a misleading protest campaign, does have the potential to make Sri Lanka a bigger trade hub.
We do have an island mentality which sometimes makes us covet insularity and shun greater connectivity, without thinking of the ultimate benefits of greater integration with the Asian mainland. We have to change our attitudes to cope with the times and economic imperatives. Several countries that recently traversed in the direction of isolationism are now discovering that it is not so easy to live alone in a globalised world. We need to more enlightened and more open to greater regional connectivity as proposed by OBOR and similar projects.

Over Rs. 12 mn invested in 10 schools across the island
CDBs flagship CSR project marks ten years
It has been ten years since Citizens Development Business Finance PLC (CDB) began its unique CSR initiative of Pariganaka Piyasa aimed at making IT literacy inclusive across the nation.
Based on the platform of equality of knowledge, CDB launched this flagship CSR project to develop, improve and uplift ICT education in under served and under privileged schools.
A feature that enhances the uniqueness of Pariganaka Piyasa is the fact that the IT Laboratories double up as a Community Centre for the area, enabling residents to enhance their IT knowledge as well.
Each year, CDB works towards presenting an IT laboratory to a deprived school, working in conjunction with the Ministry of Education and Zonal Education officials.
Once selected, the school receives a new IT laboratory equipped with all relevant technological infrastructure including new computers with licensed software, computer tables, chairs, scanners, printers and multi-media facilities which empowers young people and in the larger sphere the residents of the area to be interlinked with the rest of the world.
Given that ICT is now a subject being offered at the GCE Ordinary Level examination and is a compulsory life tool for everyone, CDBs investment of over LKR 12 Mn in these ten schools offers a larger gift to communities in the longer term.
CDBs tenth anniversary of Pariganaka Piyasa was marked with the gifting of an IT Laboratory to Kehelpannala Kanishta Vidyalaya in Hemmathagama Mawanella in the Sabaragamuwa Province.
The ceremony was attended by CDB senior management, school and zonal education officials, students, parents and well-wishers, CDB added further value to the initiative by conducting an ICT awareness programme at the school. Officials from the Mawanella Educational zone were briefed on the advantages of the programme and the importance ICT plays in the larger scheme of national development.
CDB is a leading non-banking financial institution serving both rural and urban communities through a network of 69 branches across the country.

Piramal Glass posts Rs 485 mn profit, declares a 26% dividend
Piramal Glass Ceylon (PGC) has completed another successful year with its highest ever turnover of Rs. 6,783 million and profit of Rs. 485 million amidst a year with two-month closure for furnace relining and upgrade.
With this achievement the Board of Directors have proposed a dividend of 26% thereby maintaining its consistent policy of dividend pay-out ratio of 50%.
Total revenue achieved for the year was Rs 6,783 million as against Rs. 6,755 million in the previous year. The domestic revenue remained almost at the same level as the previous year with Rs. 5,574 million in 2017 as against Rs. 5,437 in the previous year.
The gross profit (GP) for the year fell from Rs. 1,497 million to Rs. 1,371 million due to high trading volume done to facilitate customers during the furnace shutdown period. The GP margin dropped from 22% to 20%.
Over Rs. 2,104 million of trading was done during the year which yielded very slim margins. These imports were done from various sources, including Piramal Glass India, based on the segment, price and quality requirements.
The same impact was depicted in profit before tax and profit after tax figures. During the year under review the company achieved profit before tax of Rs. 603 million as against Rs. 805 million in the previous year and a profit after tax of Rs. 485 million as against Rs. 654 million in the previous year.
The export market sale in 2017 was Rs. 1,209 million as against Rs. 1,318 in 2016. The decline was due to capacity constraints resulting from two months of furnace closure.
The export market was managed by servicing the high-end niche segment. Also amidst these constrains several new bottles were launched and commercialised in the US and Australian markets.

Raising standards in local pepper  industry, a must
Black pepper (Piper nigrum L.), known as the King of Spices, is the most important and widely used spice in the world.
Pepper production is confined to a few countries in Asia including Sri Lanka and the Pacific, Brazil and Madagascar.Currently, Sri Lanka ranks at fifth place in terms of area under pepper cultivation (after India, Indonesia, Vietnam and Brazil), and seventh place in terms of production, with a world share of 5.7% in production.
Also, Sri Lanka is the fifth largest exporter of black pepper, after Vietnam, Brazil, Indonesia, and India. However, productivity levels in the industry remain low, despite improvements seen over the years.
Sri Lankan pepper, like other spices from the island, is well-known for its superior inherent properties. For example, Sri Lankan pepper has higher piperine content, which gives it a superior quality and pungency.
Piperine content in Sri Lankan black pepper is 2 to 6 times higher than in other countries.However, the export of sub-standard products can ruin the reputation of Sri Lanka in the international market as a supplier of high quality spices.
Therefore, significant measures need to be collectively taken to upgrade standards governing the product and production process across the pepper value chain in the country. Moreover, improving the capacity of stakeholders in the value chain to meet standards can boost pepper exports and competitiveness.
Pepper value chain
Pepper is the second most important spice grown in the country, after cinnamon.There are numerous actors performing various functions in the Sri Lankan pepper value chain, as shown in Figure 1.The figure vertically maps the functions and activities, stakeholders and supporting services in the chain from point of inputs to retail. In Sri Lanka, pepper is cultivated in the wet and intermediate agro ecological zones, in the mid and low country regions, mostly by smallholders. Most of the smallholders grow pepper in their own small plots of land (home gardens), which are less than 20 acres or 8.1 hectares.
Apart from cultivating pepper in their own lands, harvesting of pepper is also done by farmers, with the help of hired labour; some (sun/machine) dry their harvest and sell, while others dispose it in a fresh form. A majority of the farmers sell their product to village collectors or shops in the town, whichare important intermediaries in the pepper value chain.
Local collectors are sometimes farmers themselves or rural entrepreneurs who purchase pepper directly from farmers. Other than being involved in the spice wholesale trade, operating from stores based in town bordering spice growing areas, traders also purchase pepper from collectors/farmers/estates/lessees, after which they clean, dry, store, pack and transport the pepper to buyers, mostly in Colombo.
Buyers include spice exporters, low local spice manufacturers and marketers, Pettah buyers, and hotels/restaurants/households. Currently about 60% of pepper production of the country is exported, while the remainder is consumed domestically according to government sources.
Pepper bought by exporters is then dried, cleaned, graded and packed to meet the requirements of the international buyers. Currently, India alone buys 62% of pepper exports from Sri Lanka to the world followed by Germany, Pakistan, Egypt, USA, UAE, UK, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia and Spain. Together, the top ten countries account for 91% of total pepper exports from Sri Lanka.
Given that majority of black pepper from Sri Lanka is exported to the low end of the market (India), Sri Lanka should explore high end markets elsewhere (USA and EU), which are yet to be fully exploited. At the same time, stringent standards in the developed countries can act as a trade barrier to entering those markets, and therefore, Sri Lanka needs to upgrade its standards.
Lack of supply ofquality Black Pepper
Currently, there is an inadequate supply of black pepper throughout the year to meet the international demand. Moreover, the quality of black pepper production is inconsistent due to the fragmented production and absence of standards governing the pepper value chain.
Quality characteristics in pepper include appearance of the pepper, its maturity, bulk density, moisture content and presence of extraneous matter (dust, stones, leaves) in the product.Unlike the tea industry, no compulsory system to control quality by the government exists at the moment. As a result, exporters depend on the requirements prescribed by importers, and usually request quality-certifying bodies to certify the pepper.
There are Sri Lanka Standards for Black Pepper (SLS 105 Part 1: 2008) and White Pepper (SLS 105 Part 2: 2008); however, neither of these product standards is required for export at the moment. Systems certifications are increasingly obtained by the pepper industry at the exporter level and these include, ISO22000 Food Safety Standards, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Few exporters have also obtained organic and fair trade certifications. However, these standards have been voluntarily adopted by the exporters.
Quality needs to be adhered across the value chain from the point of harvest and onwards not just at the point of export.Unfortunately, this does not always happen. For example, collectors/shops buy any supply of pepper produced by farmers, regardless of the quality of pepper produced by smallholders. This is due to weaknesses in the coordination in a fragment chain, lack of awareness/regulations and poor infrastructure in terms of proper drying/storage, etc.
Moving forwardtogether
Towards improving quality standards of pepper supplies in Sri Lanka, a number of measures can be collectively taken by the government and stakeholders in the pepper value chain:
* Improve attitudes of the agents in the value chain towards adopting good agricultural and manufacturing practices not only to increase the productivity but the quality of pepper by Organizing field trips and constructing model farms in each village to educate farmers about proper agronomical practices include drying and storage of pepper;
*Provide assistance to build/upgrade process facilities like steam sterilization treatment plants, and buy equipment like dryers. The Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) will be providing a 50% grant for entrepreneurs toupgrade/add value their product/production and such assistance could be made use for this end.
*Establish central collecting/processing/ storage centres to improve quality of pepperat the intermediary stages of the value chain;
*Improve efficiency and reach of extension services by increasing resources to the Department of Export Agriculture (DEA) to carry out their activities;
*Encourage exporters to integrate backwards in the value chainby providing land or to purchasedirectly from farmers/farmer organizations to ensure a consistentquality;
*Implement mandatory standards at the point of exports to ensure quality of Sri Lankan pepper exports whilst encouragingthe adoption of quality systems such as HAACP/ISO22000 as well as good agricultural and manufacturing practices in the value chain
*Improve awareness of farmers, collectors, traders, and processors of quality requirements of export markets
*Invest in advanced testing equipment, which can detect lower limits of pesticides, aflatoxins, ochratoxins, etc.; test that are necessary to export to more developed markets.

Singer Group revenue increases 13.7% to Rs 12 bn
Singer (Sri Lanka) PLCs results for the first quarter of the year ending March 31, 2017 showed a commendable revenue growth.
This is despite sluggish consumer demand resulting from drought affecting the income of about 30% of the agriculture-based households in the country, combined with escalating prices due to devaluation and increase in VAT.
The Group revenue increased 13.7% to Rs. 12 billion. Traditional and thrust product lines of the company experienced good growth - in smart mobile phones by 56%, televisions by 27%, deep freezers and furniture by 22% each, computers by 18%.
During 1st Quarter of 2017, Singer chose not to pass on the full impact of the increase in VAT and weaker currency to customers. This reduced gross margins to 29.1% compared to 30.6% last year.
The increased mix of smart phone sales in 2017, which have lower margins, also impacted the overall group gross margin.
Net finance cost for the 1st Quarter of 2017 increased 45% to Rs 434 million. The lower margins and higher interest both impacted group profitability for the quarter under review. Group net profit for 1st quarter was Rs. 246.6 million, a reduction of 33% compared to the prior year (excluding the one-time gain recorded in the 1st Quarter of 2016).
Singer (Sri Lanka) company only, Net Profit in the 1st Quarter increased 49% to Rs. 319.6 million mainly due to dividends from subsidiaries.
Subsidiary Companies, Regnis (Lanka) PLC had a Profit of Rs. 86 million and Singer Industries (Ceylon) PLC had a Profit of Rs. 9.4 million.
Revenue of Singer Finance (Lanka) PLC increased by 27% although Net Profit decreased due to higher financing costs, initial cost of credit card operations and impairment of the replaced ERP software programmes.
Commenting on the first quarter results of 2017, Asoka Pieris, Group CEO stated, We look forward to the transient weaker trading conditions gradually improving during the remainder of 2017 and we remain confident that our key business initiatives will continue our impressive revenue and profit growth trajectory.

Sri Lanka will be granted duty free access to European markets under the Generalized System of Preference Plus (GSP +), effective tomorrow (May 16).
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday said the restoration of the facility, GSP Plus, will be published in the European Commission official journal today.
EU GSP will enter into force on the day following its publication in the EC official journal.
Minister Karunanayake said that supported by the GSP + status, the country will be able to generate 10, 000 to 20, 000 jobs.
The facility stands to create a major growth in the countrys apparel industry.
The country lost considerable revenue on garment exports after the European Union had revoked its GSP + in 2010 due to its failure to implement a number of core human rights treaties, namely the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and Convention against Torture (CAT). Karunanayake said with the advent of the unity government in 2015 led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Rani Wickremesinghe they addressed many issues that had led to the withdrawal of GSP + by the European Commission.
We have cleared the hurdles,Karunanayake said. The GSP + will create opportunities for our economic growth. It will diversify our exports to the EU market, he said.

The national teams six-day residential training camp at the Centre of Excellence  Kandy ahead of the Champions Trophy 2017 drew to a close with a practice game on Sunday before the team returns to Colombo for three well-deserved days off with their families prior to departing Colombo on May 18.
The program that was spread across an intense schedule of sessions focused on specialty training, strength training and conditioning, altitude training, team building and motivation, strategic simulation and analytical sessions and specialist sessions with the bat, ball and on the field.
The sessions conducted by SLCs panel of expert coaches were both practical and theoretical, and included group-centric activities such as quizzes and quickfire sessions as well as strategic discussions. Individual players were also given the opportunity for focussed one-on-one training to hone their technique and skills.
Speaking on the success of the camp, skipper Angelo Mathews stated: A residential atmosphere like this where we can dedicate a 100% to our game is an essential part of preparation going into an important tournament like this. Over the past months many of us have not been able to play together consistently as a team due to injury or other factors, so working together like this and learning to work with and around each others strengths is a great thing.
The scope of facilities at Pallakelle has made this a truly successful program. Working in these professional conditions is truly a bonus, and the technology made available to us in real time Indoor [nets] has really helped us hone our skills, I cant wait till the centre is completed, it will be a benchmark, he said.
Team Manager Asanka Gurusinha was also happy with the facilities at the CoE and commented: With the festive season of Vesak at hand just ahead of this tour, I am really pleased that the SLC president initiated this residential program so that we have the players all focussed and dedicated completely, which obviously would be a challenge in Colombo.

SriLankan Airlines' search for a new partner turns desperate

Sri Lankan officials are getting increasingly desperate to find a private-sector partner to share the burden of rehabilitating flag carrier SriLankan Airlines.
The airline, which for a decade was managed and partly owned by Emirates, saw its expenses and debt level soar after the respected Gulf carrier pulled out its team in 2008 amid tensions with then-President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe kicked off the search for a new partner for SriLankan last year, culminating in the selection of TPG Capital, a U.S. private equity group with a record of guiding airline turnarounds, ahead of seven other bidders.
On May 5, however, SriLankan Chairman Ajith Dias announced to staff that TPG had ended talks to buy a 49% stake after completing its due diligence on the airline and concluding potential returns were less attractive than other investment options.
The airline has been losing money since 2009 and in its annual report for the year ended March 2016, it reported current liabilities of 100.26 billion Sri Lankan rupees ($657.3 million), double its total assets.
According to a preliminary results announcement on May 4, the carrier lost 6.49 billion rupees in the year ended March 31, excluding finance and one-off charges. The loss was aggravated by the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar because of the airline's heavy dollar-denominated expenses and by flight cancellations necessitated by the daytime closure between January and March of the runway at Colombo's international airport for resurfacing work.
Officials told the Nikkei Asian Review that following TPG's retreat, Wickremesinghe appointed Minister of Public Enterprise Development Kabir Hashim, Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrema and Minister of Special Assignments Sarath Amunugama to talk to Emirates, Qatar Airways and AirAsia in hopes of convincing one of them to be SriLankan's partner.
The move bypasses two bidders that had originally been shortlisted by the government alongside TPG but which lacked its track record in international operations and airline turnarounds. Peace Air, a defunct private local airline that has announced plans to restart operations, had bid with support from Lufthansa Consulting, an arm of the German airline. Trans Maldivian Airways, an air-taxi service operating in the nearby archipelago, had bid with reported backing from Singaporean air services company SATS. Peace Air in March announced plans to file legal challenges to its exclusion from the due diligence process.
Family business
An official inquiry following the change in Sri Lanka's government in 2015 found that gross mismanagement and corruption had ruined SriLankan's finances. The investigation panel said Nishantha Wickramasinghe, chairman of SriLankan between 2010 and 2015 and a brother-in-law of Rajapaksa, was paid 500,000 rupees a month despite having no relevant qualifications.
The inquiry said the ex-chairman had received luxury SUVs, in addition to a Mercedes-Benz car and a Toyota Land Cruiser Prado. Through him, the airline issued more than 700 free tickets for a rugby tournament and nighttime motor racing events in Colombo, pet projects of Rajapaksa's sons.
The coalition government elected in 2015 was compelled to pay $170 million to aircraft leasing company AerCap Holdings as penalty for canceling a contract for four Airbus A350 aircraft. Deputy Minister of Public Enterprise Development Eran Wickramaratne told the Nikkei Asian Review that the airline did not require such long-range aircraft since the majority of its flights are shorter range.
Chairman Dias, who was appointed in 2015, said in October that he had inherited "quite a mess" and that "unnecessary aircraft" would be returned to lessors to cut operating losses. SriLankan, which has a fleet of 24 aircraft, has suspended loss-making flights to Paris and Frankfurt and is focusing on more lucrative routes in Asia and the Middle East. It is adding three routes into India in the coming months, which will give it the largest number of Indian destinations of any foreign airline.
Emirates bought 40% of the airline, then known as Air Lanka, for $70 million in 1998. It later increased its stake to 43% but eventually sold its shares to the government for $53 million after Rajapaksa ordered the revocation of the visa of Peter Hill, then the airline's chief executive, when he refused to accommodate a political delegation on an international flight. SriLankan's workforce, which stood at 5,113 in 2008, had swelled to 6,987 by 2015 because of political appointments.
Political interference
Harsh Vardhan, chairman of Starair Consulting, an aviation consultancy in New Delhi, said SriLankan was a classic example of how political interference and bad management can ruin an organization. "SriLankan was a great success story of public-private partnership which became a victim of the politics of ego," he said.
The airline's staff members are increasingly concerned about job security. According to Vijitha Herath, a member of parliament for the People's Liberation Front, workers are worried about the possible impact of the airline's privatization. He alleged that the airline's board and senior executives continue to enjoy extravagant perks, including free upgrades from economy to business class.
"At a time when SriLankan is suffering from its worst-ever financial crisis, there is no need for such perks to be doled out to the directors and other staff," he said. "What the airline needs is good management and strong political leadership to manage the board of directors and the staff, but the biggest problem is that there is no strong political leadership."
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake told the Nikkei Asian Review in early April that the government had no plans to fully privatize the carrier. "What we are looking at is the commercialization of the airline, which will be based on a partnership or a joint venture," he said.
Whether the government can find any partner both willing and able to work with its criteria and bear the risk of further political intervention remains an open question.

Stop smiling in photos if you want to look younger
Most people know it takes 25 fewer muscles to smile than it does to frown. The act of smiling has numerous positives attached to it. Not only does it make you look happy and approachable, but it also releases endorphins, making it a surefire way to boost your mood.
Sadly, its emerged that smiling is not all its cracked up to be. If its your go-to photo expression, experts have some bad news. A recent experiment found that smiling in photos can add up three and half years to your face, writes The Sun . This is because smiling apparently exaggerates the appearance of wrinkles around the eyes. Maybe you dont care. Maybe life is too short to worry about things like these. Or maybe your anti-ageing regimen is so efficient you need never worry about wrinkles again.
However, if your appearance in photos does matter to you, there are some alternative facial expressions which will help reduce the appearance of wrinkles. And it seems as if the likes of Kylie Jenner and Victoria Beckham - neither exactly renowned for their readily beaming faces - are on to something. After the research was conducted, it was found the best faces to adopt are either a neutral expression, or a pouting surprised one. One thing which was rather sweet and reassuring was the participants said they still believed smiling makes people look younger.
However Melvyn Goodale, who worked on the study at the University of Western Ontario, Canada, rained on their parade somewhat, saying. We show that this belief, which is well-rooted in popular culture, is a complete misconception.
So there you go, even if youre having the time of your life, dont let it show on your face. Mirror

Tax relief to draw investments
The government yesterday announced a new investment incentives scheme and new income tax structure that will come into effect with the passage of the new Inland Revenue Act in Parliament.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, giving out details of the new investment relief approach of the government, said significant tax exemptions and incentives have been granted to the investors depending on the size of the investment.
The minister, however, stressed that the tax holidays would hereafter be granted only when the investment is made, and not prior to that.
We have introduced a different concept to tax holidays. So far, the tax holidays were granted just after the investors agree on the investment. But in the future, the investors have to make the investment first and show their commitment to be eligible to get the tax holiday, Karunanayake said.
He said the generation of one million job opportunities, spurring investments to meet the target of USD 5-6 billion Foreign Direct Investments per year and giving a much clearer and simpler tax structure are the intentions of the new proposals.
Earlier, there was a convoluted process and investors were perturbed. Now we have given a straightforward approach to them, he said.
The minister, who was addressing a press conference at his ministry premises yesterday, said the Inland Revenue Bill that received Cabinet approval was already sent to the Government Printer to publish in the Gazette.
The passage of the Bill will take several weeks as it has to remain in the Order Paper of Parliament for a certain number of days after the first reading. The Prime Minister instructed me to speak to the media and give out the details of the new system that will come into operation, so that the investors coming into the country during this transient period will not be confused, he explained.
The minister, commenting on the borrowings, said the government borrowings exceeded the limit approved by Parliament from 2011-2014, but this amount was lesser than the approved limit in 2015 and 2016.
He said this years revenue has shown significant improvement, adding that it was Rs. 94 billion above the estimate as of now. He attributed this improvement largely to the Revenue Administration and Management Information System (RAMIS) newly introduced to the Department, adding that automatic filing process brought a sense of discipline to the tax collection.
According to the new investment incentive scheme announced yesterday, investments over USD 2 billion for ports development will be fully exempted from the Corporate Tax. Incentives have also been given to investments less than USD 3 million, investments that generate significant number of employment opportunities, as well as large-scale investments.
The minister explaining the new income tax structure said, hub activities, export of IT/BPO services, export of gold, gem and jewellery, relocation of International Head Quarters, earning from international trading platform, organic fertilizer production, solid waste management, export of services by individuals, agriculture/poultry/dairy, middle income housing would be exempted from the Corporate tax.
Corporate tax system is simplified to a three-tier rate structure and concessionary rate is capped at 50 percent of the standard rate, the minister said, adding that concessionary rates apply for SMEs, export of goods and services, local IT industry, manufacturing furniture, education, tourism, fisheries, plantation, renewable energy, freight forwarding, Employees Trust Funds, Provident or Pension Funds and Termination Funds and charitable institutions.
Higher rates of Corporate Tax apply for liquor, tobacco, and betting and gaming. Tax free threshold for Personal Income Tax is Rs 500,000 per annum and this threshold for PAYE tax is Rs 1.2 million.
Tax on Capital Gain will be 10 percent, and it is applicable to land and buildings and other investments excluding quoted shares.

Towards a coherent economic policy
As the country gears up for fast pace growth in the next few years, a coherent national economic policy is a must to aid this growth and help attract more Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) into the country, said Professor. of Finance at the University of Houston (USA), Financial Economist and the President of Sri Lanka Finance Association, Prof Lalith Samarakoon in an interview with the Daily News.
Excerpts follow:
Q. What do you think of the current economic policy environment in the country
A. There has been little change in policy in the last two years. There is a need for a coherent economic policy. We saw the new government come in and they had to conduct certain diagnostics to see what is going on and then understand where the needs are. But one of the key issues are economic policy uncertainty and that is not good for the government.
This means that there is uncertainty in policy formulation, communication of policies and its implementation.
When you take policy, it is a long-term guideline of strategy based on proper analysis of the situation and the long-term needs of the country. To formulate this, we first need an institutional framework, secondly, you need the people- experts and other stakeholders, thirdly, we need to see what is being done, and what are the gaps and issues and fourthly, what is the best experience in other countries in terms of dealing with these issues. We dont need to follow them but at the same time, we dont need to re-invent the wheel. You then also have to have the consultation with all stakeholders including the public, have it approved at a higher level and then communicated to all.
It looks almost like theory but it works in practice. Countries that have done well have got this methodology right. So to get the right policy environment, we need these frameworks set up.
Q. It is generally accepted that public consultation of policies in a country such as ours will not bear fruition in time and it is easier if it is made at the top and then implemented. Can you explain how similar Asian countries have dealt with this
A. I agree that is how it is done and I think that is the problem. At present, policies are formulated at a political level, the problem with this is, what is the top you are talking about The top can be what I call a bureaucratic expert framework, devoid of politics. So in real policy formulation, once it is formulated at the bureaucratic level, it can go to the next level, which is the political. At the political level, you are talking about the cabinet and the rest. The problem with policies being formulated at the political first is that it might not necessarily address the issues in a coherent, comprehensive way and it may not relate to the needs of the constituents.
Countries which have more diverse opinions that Sri Lanka have, managed to do this. Diverse viewpoints can be taken into account through an institutional framework and short cutting the policy process means you are not addressing the national economic problems on a long term basis. And you end up consulting only a segment of the people because you want to get it done early but I dont think even that has happened because we have not been able to make policies for the big or small issues. Rarely does it happen that we say ok we want to make this policy fast and implement it and move forwards.
When we dont address issues in a consensus-building manner, when governments change, policies change. So in order to preserve the long-term integrity of the policy, it is important that we get it right.
Q. Are you proposing an economic think tank of sorts or a planning commission
A. Yes, something similar. It would be more of a National Economic Council. It has to be a permanent structure so that it will not be changed with changing governments. And it should be staffed by experts and bureaucrats of all fields. They can formulate the policies and issues can be brought to their notice by anyone, including the politicians, but they take a very coordinated, careful approach to formulating policy for the country. When this is submitted to the political level, they can change it, but if they are going to change it completely, there might still be problems in the way we make policy but we must expect certain changes.
But countries such as South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, etc have jumped this hurdle. Though political structures may change they have ensured that the economic policy machinery that runs the country, to a certain degree, remains constant. They have institutionalized the running and implementation of the economic policy of the country, which we too need to do.
Q. That would instill the confidence needed for businesses both local and international to invest in the economy
A. Yes. We as a country have never had a serious effort at establishing a policy making and implementation machinery. There have been ad hoc measures and various attempts to establish various committees, but I think that without a coordinated approach of that nature, we will be able to make substantial progress in any economic matter.
Q. What are the priority areas the government could look at to improve the economy
A. Number one is public finance reforms. That would mean largely tax reforms and expenditure reforms which is why we are in the IMF program right now; to put some structure to the fiscal policy.
Q. With the IMF program there are questions about whether we can implement all what they want and whether it is best suited to our own context. What do you think
A. The IMF program is aimed mostly at addressing the fiscal issue and the budget deficit; so everything is connected to revenue and expenditure.
When you take the IMF experience with the European debt crisis; you see that the latter, as a result of mismanagement of public finances, had the twin problems of debt and deficit. They thus sought the assistance of the IMF in addition to that of the European Central Bank. The IMF prescriptions would ultimately try to bring down the fiscal deficit to a reasonably manageable level. This would mean cutting down public expenditure and increasing revenue; usually by increasing taxes. And this could be counterproductive in terms of retarding the growth and this happened, for example in Greece and it never been able to recover. Overall Europe seems to have gotten out of that stalemate and they expect growth but not necessarily all these countries have resolved their debt and deficit issues because of retarded growth. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to implement IMF prescriptions in a way that would not reduce the economic growth of the country in a substantial manner, thats why when a country goes to the IMF program, they need to know whether it is the right thing for them. One option for the country is to figure out their fiscal management policy on their own and if not, you have the IMF program and once you are in it, you are borrowing money and you have to agree to their policy conditions. But even with the program, it is up to us to figure out what the right approach to it is in the context of Sri Lanka and what the right sequencing and timing is. So that the medicine is not injected in a drastic manner. You have to sequence, for that to happen, we need to know what we need. We should understand our problems really well and the solutions to them and if we dont have a coordinated institutional framework to understand the problems and find out what the policy prescriptions might be, we will be walking blind. And you will take whatever the prescription they give in their timeframe.
On the other hand, anytime you have to squeeze the belts of the public, it is going to backfire. Ultimately, you want to do something with some sort of public support, you cannot ignore that. In Greece, when the public became unsatisfied with the program, they changed the government.
Q. What are the other economic policy suggestions
A. Tax reforms are very important. You have to have a simple, efficient tax system which is development and investment growth enhancing; you dont want a tax system that is retarding. Think of how the tax system would give incentives to the sectoral areas where growth is needed, bring in FDIs and improve the capital markets.
On the fiscal side, expenditure reform is also much needed. Sri Lanka has always had a tendency to opt for a luxurious style of government structure, which is disproportionately large to the needs of a country this size. We have political structures, we have governance structures, departments, ministries, etcone really needs to look at downsizing and streamlining government.
If you could do that, you could solve a lot of the fiscal problems.
Q. That would be a politically unpopular decision to make
A. Yes, nothing is going to be popular. When the country is in a state of flux, when you have issues in almost every area of economic activity, we need the bold political leadership to say, We need to fix this and nothing is easy. I am not suggesting anything that would be hundred percent accepted by the public. That is why implementation should not be drastic, if you know the path you want to go on, then make a timeline and gradually implement it. But you have to do it, otherwise you will be stuck in a place like Greece where they have been unable to make changes for a long time. Whereas our neighbours, including India and Bangladesh, have figured things out.
Though we might be ok with our economy staying flat, relatively speaking we are going to be lagging behind in the region.
Apart from these, public enterprise reforms need to be done. Because the government can no longer afford to have loss-making public enterprises. If you take loss-making commercial enterprises, you need to restructure them and the government could think about bringing in private investors, and listing them on the stock exchange but retaining government ownership so that they can benefit from the increased value and dividends, rather than completely privatising them. Similar to what we did with the plantations initially.
You dont need to go to 51 percent immediately, at least 5-10 percent, sell it through an IPO, and this would bring in the market discipline, management structures and business models.
The government can no longer finance these enterprises because where would they get the funds when it has a continuous budget deficit They would have to borrow money for that, then debt stock will increase and we will be stuck in a vicious cycle.
The governments idea of starting with the non-strategic enterprises is good and that should happen. They are not very controversial, so why not start with them The governments role is to regulate public enterprises that are needed for the public welfare such as utilities.
Then you have infrastructure development. Latest data from the central bank shows that infrastructure expenditure has decreased last year, and if you look at a five-year time horizon, they have remained relatively flat as a percentage of the economy though absolute levels may have increased. In 2012, it was 4.8 percent of GDP, 2013 4.7 of GDP, 2014 4.3 percent of GDP, 2015 4.9 percent of GDP and in 2016 it was 4.6 of GDP.
Q. Was this due to an increasing debt burden which had them pull back on spending
A. Not necessarily. It is perhaps the lack of ability; the government does not have enough income or there were no FDIs to invest. So we need to break this cycle. Growth will require substantial infrastructure spending. How do we do that As you said, we do have debt to deal with. Our debt level is at 79 percent of GDP, and we are talking about issues related to debt servicing which has a huge impact on the government budget. At present, the government has very little fiscal space in order to invest in infrastructure. So the money has to come from FDIs and they will have to come in a big way if we are to make a bigger stride in economic growth.
If you look at the question of FDIs, the trend there in the last five years is that they have stayed somewhere around an average of 700 USD million. The best we have had was in 2013 which was slightly more than 900 million USD. We have never even had a billion yet and last 10 years havent been that great either.
And it has continued to go down, last year it was 898 million USD and while it increased compared to 2015 where it wasUSD 680 million, relative to the economy, in 2016, it was at 1.1 percent of GDP.
We have large infrastructure needs but interest from foreign investments are low. We need to bring them in and in a large way, therefore, we need to make changes in the way we are doing our economic policy and management.
We also need to decide where these FDIs need to go: partly to infrastructure and then to export-oriented industrial development. The latter is due to the fact that we have a large amount of foreign debt that needs to be paid off in dollars and that can only be done through increasing our exports.
Here you also need an industrial production strategy. We need to identify our relative advantages and competencies and promote that. A long-term strategy apart from just having the BOI and tax incentives will be needed and it will have to project the countrys journey in the next 10-20 years. Of course, the investment landscape will change in 10 years and then can see how you can adapt to that.
The Chinese for an example are trying to implement the Maritime Silk Route to counter global weaknesses and slowing down of international trade. Similarly, we need such a mechanism for policy making.
I also think sustainable and profitable agriculture is very important to the country. Whenever you talk about inflation, you talk of the agricultural sector. We dont need to be completely protectionist, but if the agriculture is not prosperous how will people sustain it Also a country our size should not be depending on food imports. Sustainable agriculture will also give us food security which is paramount to national security.
Even if we have to do that with certain subsidies and protectionism, that is fine.
Q. What are your views on the debt situation
A. This is not something new, it has been developing for the last 10 years in some form or the otherIf you look at it from 2014-2015, there was a huge jump. At present the total debt is at Rs 9,387 billion, which is 79 percent of GDP, in 2015, it was at 78 percent. In addition, domestic debt has increased but foreign debt increased at a higher rate; a 14 percent increase for the latter while the former only had an 8 percent increase.
We have had to take in new debt to refinance existing debt. The government has also resorted to more and more foreign sources for financing government funding needs.
In 2014, foreign debt was at Rs 3,544 billion and by 2016 it was at Rs 4,046 billion. So the foreign debt has increased from 30 percent in 2014 to 34 percent in 2016. The issue is how will we sustain it all
The Central bank forecasts that the 79 percent debt in 2016, will come down to 70 percent by 2020. That is if we achieve the medium-term economic growth projections. They project a 5 percent economic growth in 2017, 6 percent in 2018, 6.5 percent in 2019 and 7 percent by 2020. But at present, we have only managed 4.4 percent growth this year.
They also project a better fiscal situation, fairly stable inflation and fairly stable interest rates. This will lead to debt sustainability.
This is the best case scenario without taking into account natural shocks to the economy.
But in the worst case scenario, if we cannot manage our growth, in my estimate, debt can increase from 79 to 87 percent by 2020. Then the country would have to go through credit restructuring and you find yourself in a debt trap. I am not saying this would happen but if you dont take action to put the situation in order, grow the economy at a higher pace, you are looking at possibilities where the debt stock will become unsustainable.
Q. Whats the best strategy to restructure debt
A. At this point, we have to hope that we will have a good growth scenario which will take our fiscal policy under control so that we will be able to slowly pay off debt and future cash needs will be funded by private sector involvement in development projects. The government cannot be the provider of capital for development purposes. The government has to say we cannot increase debt and we need to get the private sector involved through public-private partnerships, so the burden shifts from government to private sector. This is where capital markets can be of use too. But for all this, we first need a sound long-term economic policy to know where we are headed.

Update Windows, save backups, Sri Lanka CERT advises

The Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) has warned users to update their Windows software and save backups of data in an external hard drive to circumvent any harm caused by Ransomware.
Sri Lanka CERT Chief Information Security Engineer Roshan Chandragupta told Daily News Online that although there were, thus far, no reports of Ransomware having affected Sri Lankan PCs, it is wise to update Windows and save a backup given the widespread nature of the Ransomware attack.
Ransomware is a malicious software that penetrates the Widows system and takes data hostage, Chandragupta explained.
A ransom is thereafter demanded in exchange for the data, as the name implies, he said.
Over 150 countries were targeted in a synchronized cyber attack across the world on Friday, including China, Russia, United States and Britain.
USD 300 in Bitcoin is demanded as ransom to decrypt the data and restore the system to normalcy.

U.S. firms want in on Chinas global One Belt, One Road spending

As China plans to build a raft of roads, rail lines, ports and airports across Asia, Africa and Europe, skeptics say Chinese companies will be the only real winners from the ambitious initiative.
General Electric (GE)disagrees.
In 2014, Chinese construction and engineering companies ordered just $400 million worth of equipment from G.E. to install overseas, overwhelmingly in the region that encompasses the effort, known as One Belt, One Road. Last year, those orders totaled $2.3 billion, and G.E. plans to bid for an additional $7 billion in orders for natural-gas turbines and other power equipment in roughly the next 18 months.
We have a laser focus on winning these, said Rachel Duan, the chief executive of General Electric China.
China is pulling companies and countriesmore tightly into its economic and geopolitical spherewith the One Belt, One Road plan.Aforum on the effortin Beijing, hosted on Sunday by Chinas president, Xi Jinping, drew President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and other state leaders, as well as officials from more than three dozen countries, including the United States.
If enacted as planned, the initiative could lead to a global building spree; China has promised more than $1 trillion of investment over the long term.
Western companies are angling aggressively for a piece of the action. Citibank won a contract from Bank of China to handle a complex $3 billion bond offering last month to raise money for opening branches across Asia, Eastern Europe and East Africa. The technology and manufacturing companyHoneywell Internationalis selling equipment to Central Asia for processingnatural gas.
Some non-Chinese companies are also tweaking their businesses to win more orders related to Beijings plan, and G.E. has rearranged its marketing staff for global power equipment to give them priority.
Chinas spending doesnt necessarily mean immediate profit. Most of the money has yet to be earmarked, much less spent. And China  which has too many factories making too much steel and cement  is making sure that its own companies will be the biggest beneficiaries.
Companies like Caterpillar, for example, will have to contend with a fast-growing, government-controlled Chinese maker of construction machinery, the Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, known as X.C.M.G. Such businesses, facing a maturing market at home, are eager to find new markets  a core ambition of the plan.
At one of X.C.M.G.s cavernous factories here in north-central China, workers are rushing to double the number of excavators that can be made each year, mainly by adding robots to the assembly process. The initiative has the factory humming 16 hours a day, six days a week.
One Belt, One Road makes our internationalization strategy like a tiger with wings added, said Wang Min, X.C.M.G.s chairman.
For businesses, the plan offers uncertainty as well as promise. The infrastructure that China is building could someday become the avenues for billions of dollars in increased trade  or become debt-ridden sinkholes. Xi is pressuring companies already doing business in China to participate no matter what the prospects.
The hope of future prosperity is enticing. Li and Fung, a Hong Kong company that for decades has sent Chinese-made goods to American and European department stores, is now marketing to small and medium-size retailers in the developing world. It is a bet that the Chinese initiative will lift consumer spending across dozens of countries, said Victor Fung, chairman of the Fung Group, its parent company.
Others are waiting to see whether Chinas ambitious idea translates into actual investment  and whether American and European companies will have a place at the table. They are particularly troubled that the program seems to be mostly about Chinese exports, and not much about imports.
Tell us what we are going to get out of this, said James Zimmerman, a lawyer in Beijing who is a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, referring to the West. Its a nonstarter if its all about bringing Chinese goods to Europe, or if its all one way.
A top official in the Trump administration, Matthew Pottinger, the senior director for Asia at the National Security Council, said at Sundays conference that China should provide transparency in the bidding for contracts related to the initiative, to give a better chance to companies that arent state-owned.
Chinas industrial overcapacity is a big motivator behind the plan. China can make nearly 1.1 billion tons of steel a year, as much as the rest of the world put together, but has domestic demand for only about 800 million tons. The initiative might absorb only about 30 million tons a year, according to a recent study by the European Union Chamber of Commerce.
Some American companies are taking steps to improve their chances  but that sometimes means manufacturing more in China, not the United States. Duan said G.E. had focused on ways to produce goods in China to meet the countrys requirements that some of the work be done locally. Honeywell said in a statement that it had also been looking for ways to produce more goods in China for the program.
When the roads are built, when the ports are built, when the power plants are built, I think the other opportunities will come, Duan said.
Others are waiting and watching. Investments have been heavily concentrated in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other nearby countries that are geopolitical priorities for China but that have weak economies.
Vincent Lo, a real estate billionaire who is the chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, led a team of 50 Shanghai and Hong Kong businesspeople to Thailand and Vietnam last week to explore investments based on the Chinese initiative, he said. Trips to the Mideast and Eastern Europe may be next. Central Asia is far down his list.
If Central Asian countries are keen, we will work with them, but of course well have to look at the financial fundamentals, Lo said. A lot of these countries will have to do a lot of reforms to be able to receive capital.
Chinese players look to be big winners from the outset.
Xi has designated the city of Xuzhou  a dusty rail hub roughly halfway along the five-hour bullet train trip between Beijing and Shanghai  as a key manufacturing base for his policy. At the foot of a hill here topped by a new complex of Buddhist temples, Caterpillar has one of the worlds biggest construction machinery factories, making huge pieces of digging equipment.
Nearby, its local rival X.C.M.G. is ramping up. Employing 23,000 workers in this city and controlled by the Xuzhou municipal government, X.C.M.G. is Chinas largest manufacturer of construction machinery, from excavators to cranes to bulldozers.
The factory makes tank-size excavators in a series of four halls with 80-foot-high steel roofs. Almost everything inside is new, from the 13 steel-cutting robots the size of cottages to the costly Italian and Japanese machining equipment that precisely trim steel components.
Wang, X.C.M.G.s chairman, dismissed concerns that the business wont materialize.
We should be persistent and manage our business as well, he said. When the spring comes, we will arise abruptly.

Vandoorne starts from back of grid after penalty
Montmel: Belgiums Stoffel Vandoorne will start from the back of the grid at Sundays Spanish Grand Prix after the McLaren-Honda driver was hit with a 10-place penalty.
The penalty was handed down after his team spotted a sensor issue on his car and changed the ESS (energy store) and CE (control electronics) on his engine.
Its the fifth component of each engine element used by Vandoorne already this year and triggers a 10-place grid penalty as a result.
However, after coming a disappointing 19th in qualifying on Saturday, Vandoorne will drop back just one place to 20th and last, behind Russias Daniil Kvyat of Toro Rosso. Lewis Hamilton starts on pole. AFP

WB approves US $100 m for higher education sector
The World Bank Board of Directors approved $100 million in financing to support Sri Lankas higher education sector. This new initiative will help increase enrollment in priority disciplines, improve the quality of degree programmes and promote research and innovation in the higher education sector.
Building on experience in the higher education sector since 2003, the new Accelerating Higher Education Expansion and Development (AHEAD) operation is the first in Sri Lanka to use the World Bank Programme for Results lending instrument. This instrument focuses on building institutional capabilities to drive for sustainable development results.
Sri Lankas aspiration to rise to an Upper Middle Income Country status depends on how skilled and versatile its people are,Idah Z. Pswarayi-Riddihough, World Bank County Director for Sri Lanka and Maldives said.
The higher education system must produce a pool of highly skilled scientists, engineers, doctors, entrepreneurs, policy makers, academics, and teachers, who can contribute to sustainable economic development of the country.
Improving competitiveness and growth of the country is a key focus of the Sri Lankan Government and we are pleased to be supporting them in this endeavor.
In 2014, Sri Lanka was ranked 88th of 115 countries for higher education participation.
Moreover, Sri Lankas higher education enrollment rate of 21 percent is well below the average rate of 23 percent in Lower Middle Income Countries; and 44 percent enrollment rate in Upper Middle Income Countries.
Sri Lanka particularly needs to improve student participation in disciplines of vital importance to economic development such as the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
A key focus area of the AHEAD project is to enable universities to expand modern teaching-learning and assessment methods which increase the academic quality of undergraduate degree programmes, and the eventual social and economic contribution of graduates.
This is a first of its kind results-driven operation in support of the Governments Higher Education Development Strategy, said Harsha Aturupane, Lead Education Specialist and Task Team Leader.Promoting research, development and innovation will be essential to expand knowledge and technology-intensive industries and services to meet Sri Lankas aspirations to become an Upper Middle Income Country.
An estimated 600,000 students across a variety of higher education institutions, and approximately 5,000 academics, managers, and technical staff members will benefit directly from this programme over its 6-year implementation period, which ends in 2023. Other beneficiaries of the program will include: the private sector and government who will be able to recruit better-qualified university graduates; future generations of university students and staff members who will benefit from the system-wide reforms and improvements; and the private and public sector institutions that benefit from the research and innovation activities.
The World Bank financing for this programme includes a $67 million loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and a $33 million credit from the International Development Association (IDA).
The Ministry of Higher Education and Highways, University Grants Commission, and Sri Lanka Institute for the Advanced Technological Education will be the implementing partners at the national level.
Fifteen public sector universities and Advanced Technological Institutes and non-state Higher Education Institutions will be the institutional level implementing partners.

Why i Founded an Interdisciplinary Retreat for Artists and Writers
In 2012, I was at the Boston Film Festival, and a talented filmmaker whose short film Id just seen was telling me that she needed fresh ideas. We were at a duckpin bowling alley for a party thrown by the festival, and I was the only fiction writer in the room. The directors movie had been tense, humid, mysterious, and set in Florida, so I told her about my latest obsession: the writer Laura van den Berg whose short story collection What The World Will Look Like When All The Water Leaves Us, left me floored.
Van den Bergs characters were original and active. They had colleagues. They liked science! They lived in farflung places . . . like central Florida. But whether they were peering into a microscope or impersonating Bigfoot, they were always struggling to belong. The director, I said, should read her. That she should turn one of Van den Bergs stories into a film. While we were chatting, I found myself wishing there was a festival that put short fiction writers and short filmmakers into the same room. Just imagine: Laura van den Berg and Amy Seimetz swapping inspirations over free Sam Adams beer!
Creative types
It was then that the idea of founding a multidisciplinary retreat was planted in my mind, but it took many more years and a move out of Massachusetts to bear fruit. (Not that there is anything wrong with Massachusetts. There isnt. Ill explain.)
Creative types feel comfortable in silos. They think they dont, but they do. Back in college, I worked the midnight shift at a shitty crperie, and Id observe different cliques stumble in from the Rhode Island School of Design just down the street. The fashion designers hung out with the fashion heads. The sculptors with the sculptors. In my own college, Brown University, the poets were so attached at the hip they might have well have been conjoined.
Im a writer and my husband is a filmmaker. Sometimes I help him write his films. Thats why Ive been lucky enough to go to both film festivals and writers conferences over the last decade. But the silo thing holds water at these events, too. It would make a tremendous amount of sense, wouldnt it To have more writers go to film festivals Not only could they network with other creatives, but there is so much to learn about character development and story pacing from film. Ditto for live performances: theater, music, dance. Hell, you can even learn about plot development by watching an artist draw. Its always seemed to me that our respective mediums can be vastly enhanced by learning about someone elses. And so I made up my mind to found a mixed artists retreat of my own.
When we moved across state lines to Connecticut, serendipity saw us moving to a town powered by a nucleus of people who are passionate about literature and the arts. It took me some time to understand the lay of the land, but the lay of the land was fortuitous: Norfolk is a town of several old and esteemed families, many of whom have estates built around the town lake. Most of these estates had family camps and family cabins, a handful of which werent being used.
I did site visits. I became friendly with the owners. With its rickety swimming docks and sandy beaches, hiking paths through the Great Mountain Forest and wildflowers all around, the location was a dream. The fact that Norfolks Tobey Pond was where New Directions was founded and a site where both Barack Obama and Ezra Pound used to summer seemed a particular boon. Id start small: open the retreat to seven people. If you rent it, I thought, while I nervously wrote out the security deposit for the summer camp, I sure hope they will come.
I posted an announcement about the retreat on Facebook. I wrote to my husbands filmmaking friends. I wrote to my dancer friends, and artist friends, and hippy friends who knew people up for three days of communal living and spotty internet in the woods. Incredibly, without even having a website, I soon had a waiting list.
I have a lot of passions in life, and event management is one of them. I actually used to make my living in this line of work. For three years in my twenties, I was the party promoter for Corona Extra in Paris, which saw me driving around the le de France in a Coronamobile, getting people to dance on tables and buy a lot of shitty beer. After that, I worked in fashion PR for the designer Thom Browne, and among many other small feats of pertinacity, I was once tasked with herding 40 luxury-suited male models in and out of their ice skates and onto a rink Id found someone to build inside of a New York skyscraper in time for fashion week. I liked planning my own wedding so much that I got married twice.
Possible time
When I attended the Tin House Writers Conference back in 2011, one of the first things I did was corner the organizers to tell them they needed karaoke and cheaper beer. I can be a little intense, maybe, but it all comes from a place of wanting people to get to know each other and have the best possible time.
So that was my goal with The Cabins: the right mix of people in a bucolic setting, and for the right price. Having just had a baby, I was attuned to how precious time and resources are for American grown-ups. I didnt want anybody to have to use more than one vacation day or go broke hiring babysitters in order to attend. - Lit Hub

Written in the stars
He is a globally acknowledged legend and she is the Poetess of Sinhala Cinema. They have been married for a bit over half a century and are now spending their twilight years at their residence. No sparks flew at their first meeting and according to Sumitra Peries what was lacking in hers and Dr Lester James Peries romance was the word romance. However 52 years of togetherness proved that they were meant for each other.
Then and now
We met in Paris and Lester was more of an adviser. It was only after I started working with him that I saw a side of him which I felt was relevant for my emotional needs during that period. The way he handled matters on the sets led to our relationship. He did not mollycoddle me but let me grow as a person. I was a bit uncertain when I met him even though I knew that I wanted to do films. He was authoritative without being aggressive. Over the years I got used to him and vice versa. Now, at 98, Lester is much more dependent on me. That is because he feels lonely if I go out. That saddens me but at the same time you cannot make him do as you please. There are certain things that he is very stubborn about like food or care. He has a trouble with sleep now. So when he cannot get a good shut eye he becomes restless.
His impact on her life
I believe that everything that I am today, I owe to him. I hail from Avissawella and went to Visakha College. My parents went for the routines rather than guide me towards what I wanted to do in life. Luckily I had a brother, Kuru, who was way ahead of his time. He encouraged me to read good books.
Lester nurtured me right throughout my life. He knew I had potential. I had the capacity though I havent given it my full energy. He never imposed himself on me. The first task I did for him is to edit Gamperaliya. I was given the opportunity to take certain things into my own hands. I was able to earn my rights. He encouraged me to experiment and explore and decide on what is best for a particular scene. He helped me discover myself with loving care. If I had not met him I might have been a different sort of person.
The proposal
I dont think there was a formal proposal as such. Lester has had a bad experience because he has been married before. With us I think that it was relationship which just grew over the months. I had suitors but I was not that conscious about myself. I was basically the only woman around when we were shooting Sandeshaya in Balangoda and I felt that I should merge with those at work. I had a short hair crop then and wore my brothers outside shirts. I think I actually wear more make up now than then!
I was a bit unsure of myself and in chartering my emotions. I was not flirtatious by nature. Though my school friends had boyfriends I believed that my life was far ahead and I did not want to waste my life on trivial matters. However when I was abroad there was a young Britisher who swept me off my feet. He was reckless and took to driving fast cars etc. We parted ways when he went to Australia and I left for Switzerland.
When I started working with Lester he somehow came through as very responsible. He might have been the kind of person whom I was unconsciously looking for. We had a firm relationship at the end of Sandeshaya which was in the 1960s but there was no courting period as such. Any objections we had were carried away in the mist.
We knew that we were going to get married. He was keen that we married in church which I did not mind but I wanted a civil registration first. We got married in 1964. I wore a light blue lace sari for the wedding. Our immediate families were present for the event.
The most important lesson she learnt from him
He taught me not to go over and over a certain matter once it is done. He would say Whats the use in worrying It is gone now and we should come to terms with that. Sometimes I go over a matter and say that we should not have done so and so but Lester never does that. If he has taken a decision, he goes along with it. No regrets. He had 30 odd archers inherited from his mother and when I could not get funds for Gehenu Lamai he asked me to use that money for the project. He has never been misery. I take over the practical details of living. We have a joint account and he has never asked me what I do with myself.
Obsessions
Lester is quite obsessed about paying his taxes. He is very morale because he comes from a fairly deep rooted Catholic family. He has never imposed his religion on me.
He hates to eat alone and never has his breakfast without me. Once he has eaten he has no patience to stay in place. He is particular about cleanliness and what he eats. He never liked eating out and has never eaten anything we have brought home from outside.
He does not eat leftovers at all  even if it is a piece of papaw from the previous day. We cannot keep anything in the fridge for more than two hours. He needs freshly cooked meals. No stale food for him. I guess those things have been so much the part of his life that nobody questions about them.
Disagreements
We basically never have had arguments. I might have reprimanded him for something but that too is nothing personal. I might have said something sharp but at the end of the day he would tell me something like You know you did not need to do that. You could have told it to me in private.
I might have gotten into a rage but that is very rare and is not natural to my normal behavior. Servants usually get the better off me but what Lester has to say, he says. He has a strong vocabulary  especially in English. He can take a peg or two off people without batting an eyelid. With age Lester has become a bit demanding but our house has never been tense. We have never regretted each other.
Foodwise
We ate beef at the beginning of our life. Chicken was not that common but we eat fish. After Lester fell ill in the early 1980s we stopped having beef. Lesters curries are cooked in the same manner most of the time. He does not have the taste for ham and bacon. Lester cannot stomach chili. So even if we went to our siblings homes we used to cook and carry the food there. On location his food was cooked separately. Most of the time he liked to use his fork and spoon. Even in the Ambalantota wilderness where we shot Baddegama Lester can be seen using his fork and spoon! Lester maybe fussy about his food but he is fussy about simple things. He used to drink arrack during his early days but if it is two drinks, it is only two drinks for him.
Dress sense
Lester is a bit fussy about his clothes. He goes for long sleeved shirts and needs his cap. He was fully dressed even on the sets.
Favourite pastime
Lester always spends his free time reading. He reads anything and everything which comes his way. He recently requested me to get him Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes biography. I read anything which I feel can be converted into a film. I recently saw a news item in Sarasaviya about Clint Eastwoods biography and thought that I would not mind reading it. Lester likes to listen to all sorts of music too. As soon as he gets up he ons his radio and it is shut down only when he goes to bed at 11 pm. He also wants the TV on when he gets up.
Travels
We usually like to stay at home but if we have a choice I think we both would like to go to France. It is like a second home for us and we have emotional ties there.
One change she would have liked to make in their life
I wish we had made more films together and maybe be a bit mindful about the future and saved up to own our own house. We earned, spent and lived at that time. We were adventurers and risk taking individuals.

ADB to place strong emphasis  on public-private partnerships
The governors encouraged Asian Development Bank(ADB) to crowd-in larger private sector financing to support the regions development, especially, for infrastructure, said ADB President Takehiko Nakao, making the closing address at the 50th Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors in Yohohama recently.
Nakao said they were placing a strong emphasis on publicprivate partnerships. In our private sector operations, we plan to expand our guarantee operations, equity investments, and co financing. At the same time, I would like to note that in a way ADB was created to mobilize private sector resources by leveraging our equity to tap capital markets.
Many of you stressed the need to scale up ADBs private sector operations. I assure you that we are deeply committed to increasing our private-sector operations to 25% of regular OCR operations by 2020. In particular, we intend to expand such operations in poorer countries. We are expanding staff resources for our Private Sector Operations Department to facilitate this scale up, he said.
Nakao said the merger of Asian Development Fund (ADF) lending operations and Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR) balance sheet allows them to further leverage these resources. He said experience in the past 50 years demonstrates that both public and private sector investments by ADB through preparing necessary infrastructure and setting conducive policy environment help crowd-in private sector resources and activities.
The ADB President said they were on track towards meeting the ambitious financing target of $6 billion for climate change by 2020. He also pledged to increase support for universal health coverage, technical and vocational education and training (TVET), and social protection.
Nakao pledged to continue to strengthen co-financing efforts with its private, bilateral and multilateral financing partners, including new institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank.
ADB also doubled its lending to Sri Lanka in 2017 with an allotment of US$ 800 million.

Regaining GSP+ doesnt  warrant wage hikes
Ex-President of Free Trade Zone Manufactures Association, Dhammika Fernando cried foul over remarks made by Ministry of Labour John Sevenviratne that regaining of GSL Plus would result in additional wages for the apparel sector.
This is a total misconception and a misleading statement by the Minister of Labour who seemed to be ignorant of the developments of the GSP plus. This will also stir up the unions and create an unnecessary misunderstanding.
He said that the benefit of GSP Plus would be for buyers from EU as they would not have to pay duty of around average 2 to 12.5% for 1,400 tariff headings. This does not mean that the buyers would pay more to us (manufactures) and hence there would be no additional income for us However there may be additional orders to us from EU countries, but that too would take time.
In this scenario we would not get additional revenue and hence how can we give a wage increase he asked.He said the minister must soon clarify this or the unions would bat on this statement and create an unnecessary situation. He however said that the Minister of Labour should look as to how over 35,000 job vacancies in the Free Trade Zone alone are not being filled and launch a campaign to fill them.

Age old sweet treats
Do you wish youd kept a few of your favourite, long-gone chocolate bars in the house for a rainy day
We can no longer tuck into Cadbury Dreams, Aztecs or orange Drifters, should a craving hit us while were watching Coronation Street.
Well, most of us cant. But one man in Wales has been stashing limited edition choccie bars for decades - including some with special Westlife and Spice Girls wrappers (yes, thats how old they are).
Lester Hughes, from Pwllheli, has bags and boxes full of the stuff and has even been offered 40 for his special Star Wars-themed bars.
Some even went out of date in the early 1990s and he stopped collecting more than 15 years ago when he had a freezer disaster - but he still has a cellar full of them.
The 47-year-old father-of-two told the Daily Post : I cant remember exactly why I started collecting. I think I saw limited edition on a bar once and thought, why not buy it and save it.It then became a bit of an obsession and I actively went looking for limited edition chocolate bars to buy. I decided to put them in my freezer but then it got to the point where I had more chocolate in my freezer than actual food.
It was like this for a few years until my freezer broke, so I put them in to bags and boxes and took them down to the cellar.
Ive not checked them all but some of them go back 20 to 25 years.
I have no plans to start collecting again, Im not sure I have the space in the freezer to keep them anymore, or the willpower not to eat them now either! Lester doesnt want to sell the bars, even though he was offered 40 for the limited edition Star Wars chocolate, as he wants to keep the collection together. The dad added: Since putting the pictures of the bars up on Facebook Ive had a really good response.
I think a lot of people remember some of the chocolate bars when they were children themselves.
Its good for people to see some of the bars they no longer make anymore.
What is amazing is that I cant even find some of the bars of chocolate in my collection on google, so Im wondering if even the chocolate companies themselves have kept a bar for reference.Sky News

St. Anthonys College had very little to worry against Prince of Wales as they ran up over a century of points winning by 115 points (10 goals, 9 tries) to 10 (2 tries) victory in their Plate competition inter-schools rugby match played at Trinity College grounds, Pallekelle yesterday. The scoreline was the highest for the season.
The Antonians finally playing as a team dominated their opponents in the loose and mauls as they had a bulk of possession to humiliate the Cambrians who suffered the ignominy of losing by such a large margin.
Even before the second half began the Katugastota supporters knew the game was good as over as Antonians took firm control of the game by leading 74-0.
The Antonians played a good game and their forwards won the ball and the threes worked the line beautifully.
They were more in the opponents territory doing all what was possible in rugby - rucking, driving and keeping the ball with them for a major part of the game.

Lionel Fernandez
Honest man
It is with great sadness that we announce the passing away of Lionel Fernandez. Lionel was the loving husband of Wilma Fernandez for 49 years. He leaves his wife, two sons, Mike and Dave, daughter-in-law Purvi (Daves wife), granddaughter Angelina, older brother Gabo, younger sisters Kamala and Bridget, several nephews and nieces and numerous other family members and friends.
He attended St. Benedicts College in Sri Lanka and was regarded very highly for his athletic and academic achievements. Lionel, known as LPS amongst his friends, was an accomplished athlete throughout his school career in sports such as track and field, soccer, hockey and cricket. His team mates in athletics were Godson Vincent Perera, Aldo Abeysena and Maxwell Zoysa. Football mates were Godson Perera, Eric Perera, Nithi and Sampooran Nicholas, Mark Kronemberg and 'Bana' Rajaratnam. Lionel excelled in athletics, winning the 400 and 880-metre events at the Public Schools Athletic meet.
After arriving in Canada with his wife in 1974, he started working for a company which he remained loyal to throughout his working years. He also continued to show a love for sports by coaching his sons soccer teams for many years where he demonstrated leadership and was a role model for many kids. As he grew older, watching sports such as baseball, basketball and soccer with his family continued to be a big part of his life.
Over the past 2  years, Lionel was battling an illness that he ultimately succumbed to on Thursday, March 23.
Throughout his life, Lionel exemplified kindness, honesty and a passion to spread joy to those around him. Although he will be sorely missed by his family and friends, he would not want us to mourn his death, but rather, celebrate his life.
May he rest in peace.

Monica Marion Phyllis De Alwis peacefully clasped the blessed hands of the almighty god, though unexpectedly, after a livelihood of 96 years on April 6, 2017. She was the precious life partner of the late senior attorney-at-law Lucian A.P. De Alwis JPUM.
Monica De Alwis was the third of twelve siblings in the family of the departed well-known criminal lawyer Chevalier C.L.W. Perera and the late Esther Perera of Kurunegala. Amma was the doting mother of five sons and six daughters. She was also the fond grandmother to twenty five children, as well as adorable great grandmother of fourteen kids.
Amma was the doyen and matriarch of a wide and extended family circle comprising of Doctors, Lawyers, Engineers, Bank and Mercantile Executives, IT Professionals and Entrepreneurs. She hailed from a lineage of gentility and repute in a conservative ardent catholic background. Amma was always simple and humble, modest and elegant in attire, religious and zealous with no false airs and cultivated demeanours. Her gracefully and pleasing ways were the hallmark of her interactions in society with relations, friends, clergy and colleagues.
She was faithful and loyal to her late husband and supported him in all endeavours, be it family matters, professional needs, solutions to problems and in all aspects of living. They were attached to each other, heightened by understanding, trust and hope. The upkeep and bringing up of a large family were no burden to them. Amma actively joined Thaththa in providing the necessities and requirements of the family ranging from nutrition, medication, clothing, counselling, education, music and sports. She maintained a spic and span household with order and decor. Her domain was of course the kitchen, where she prepared balanced and healthy food with care and attention.
Ammas culinary skills were prominently displayed on important and significant occasions with a well-laid out, grilled and garnished table carrying sumptuous dishes. Featured among them was her appetising Beef Smore and the delicious Seeni Sambol.
The highlight of the marriage of Thaththa and Amma was the celebrations of their Fiftieth wedding Anniversary in 1994 at the Mount Lavinai Hotel amidst family, relations and friends, with joyful toasts and felicitations and bands and music beginning with a mass of thanksgiving. The golden era continued further for five years and ended in 1999, with the demise of Thaththa. Consequent to her husband's death, Amma lived in prayer, remembrance and gratitude for eighteen long years with love, care and support, surrounded by grateful family.
Amma nurtured a pleasant outdoor environment with cultivation of exotic plants, paying special attention to flowering varieties. Befittingly, her bier was adorned with clusters of varies hues of fragrant Roses and Dahlias. Her prowess with the needle was the exponent of a unique talent. Her nimble and swift fingers transformed colourful and designed creations of embroidery handiwork, which attracted the admiration of many for their execution, neatness and presentation. The image of Santa Claus impressed in thread on chair covers are yet exhibited at Christmas. The bedspreads meticulously worked out in patterns of appropriate designs and motifs are still preserved as family heirlooms.
Another aspect of Amma's profound standards was her respect, regard concern, friendship and assistance to others, including orphanages and elders' homes. It was in consideration of others wants as well as an acknowledgement of their success, she moved among people sincerely with ease and freedom, not forgetting their birthdays and anniversaries. Amma also took intense pleasure in presenting gifts and memorabilia at appropriate times. Unforgettable are the splendid Christmas get-togethers when Santa Claus called our names to hug us with a present.
Amma's departure from the earthly shores marked an innings of accomplishments in love and fidelity, in care and concern, in goodwill and sincerity, in charity and assistance, in praise and trust in God.
Thank you Amma for the memories you have left and for the good times we have shared.
The obsequies were conducted by Rev. Fr. Bonnie Fernandopulle and Rev. Fr. Sriyan Ranasinghe OMI and her mortal remains were laid to rest in her husband's grave at Mount Lavinia Cemetery.
May Amma be at Peace!

Raja Raja Kuruppu Kuruppu
Benevolent soul
Raja came to Royal Prep School from Galendale, Bandarawela, which was a branch of Royal Prep during the world war years. Having entered Royal Prep as a matter of course, he joined the main College in 1947. From then onwards, he was a member of the Royal College 47 Group. The 47 Group celebrated its 70th anniversary recently, being 70 years since its members left Royal College, in the years of either 1955 or 1956. In the Prep School, we had a dedicated group of teachers and when we left to join the main College, our Head Master was the late H.D. Sugathapala. At that time, respect for teachers and good discipline among students was taken for granted and there was no breach in those values. The College calendar was divided into three phases. The first term was devoted to study in our new class and the Royal-Thomian Cricket match. The next term had the Royal-Trinity Rugger match and the main event in the last phase, which was the examination term was the College prize-giving.
Raja was a good student and had an interest in being an economist. In sports, he had a passion for swimming, but he could not participate in swimming as the College at that time did not have a swimming pool of its own. The only swimming pool was at St. Thomas, Mt. Lavinia, which was not accessible to us students. He played a leading role in the Debating Society of the College in both, the Sinhala and English languages and he won the Best Speakers Prize for Sinhala.
Raja did not play cricket, but he was always busy organizing the fun and frolic associated with the Royal-Thomian Cricket match. One year, he got the bright idea of getting an old crock for us for the Royal-Thomian cricket match. Raja had the initiative to interview the late Richard Pieris and succeeded in obtaining an old crock for us to travel to the match. The car was decorated with blue and gold flags and we travelled to the match in it from Royal College. At that time, there was no cycle parade. As the big match fever subsided and the new term arrived, we began preparing for the Royal-Trinity Rugger match. The focus was on the match at Kandy. We travelled to Kandy by train, but had no accommodation in Kandy. Our normal practice was to appeal to the police to give us a place to sleep for the night. The team stayed at Trinity College. That year, Trinity had a strong team and Royal was badly defeated. The Bradby shield remained in Kandy and we had to travel back from Kandy shouting Whats the matter Minor matter.
The third was the term that we had to face examinations. Though we were not brilliant students, we passed examinations without a problem. We entered the Peradeniya University and our Hall of Residence was Jayathileke Hall. Raja occupied a room adjoining my room. I had to face a viva to gain entrance to the University. Raja advised me to name Palmistry as my hobby in my application form, as he said that the interview would be easy as he was sure the professors would like to get their palms read as a part of the interview. He produced details about the palms of the professors which he had gathered from others who had faced the viva with palmistry as their hobby. As he predicted, I spent much time reading the palms of the interviewers at the interview.
Our university days were spent in study and fun associated with university life. The rag was PT in the morning at the quadrangle in our hall of residence and singing songs to entertain the seniors at night. There was no sordid ragging of freshers at that time. During our University days, a sad event took place when a student from our hall was drowned in the Mahaweli. His funeral was in Batticaola and some of us went to see the last rights performed.
The exams were nearby and we were preparing for them. In each room, they were discussions as to the examination questions that could be expected. We came upon the bright idea that the best way to get the questions would be by tumbler-talking. The dead students room had been unoccupied for quite some time. Raja and a few of us entered this room at night and commenced tumbler-talking. To our surprise, the tumbler moved and gave us some questions, but those questions, to our dismay, were not in the examination paper! We then abandoned tumbler-talking. Post University, both, Raja and I belonged to the Jayathilake Hall group that met regularly every year in Colombo. At the last get-together, Raja gave a talk from the head table on 'The Life of Sir D.B. Jayatillake,' in whose honour the hall of residence was named.
Raja joined the Public Service and his first appointment was at the Port Cargo Corporation. Later, he moved to various other positions in the Public service and occupied a prestigious position in the General Treasury prior to retirement. Raja belonged to that band of dedicated public servants who executed policy decisions with integrity.
The Young Mens Buddhist Association (YMBA) attracted Rajas attention. He became an active member and finally became a Vice President. The various organisations of the YMBA such as the Gamini Matha Home for Elders for instance, had his support and assistance. He was the moderator at many of the Buddhist Panel Discussions held at the YMBA. He was a frequent panelist on Buddhist discussions in English involving the Dhamma, both, on television and the radio. His knowledge of the Buddha Dhamma was very deep and he lucidly communicated the Dhamma to people of all faiths. A regular visitor to Metharamaya, he contributed much to the Buddhist programmes at The Maithri Hall to disseminate the Dhamma.
The Royal College Union was another organization that he served with devotion. He was its Secretary for many years. Finally, he was Vice President of the Union and at his funeral, the Union paid him a just tribute. Though born to a politically active family, Raja did not indulge in the hurly burly of electoral politics. He had a good knowledge of political affairs which he displayed when a few of us met at the regular luncheon meetings organized by Raja every two months at his favourite Chinese Caf, the Moon River. Perhaps a shrewd politician for his political survival must be able to truthfully invent falsehoods. Raja would never do that.
Rajas life was well spent. It was a good mix of religion, dedication to his Alma mater, servant of the public in many important capacities and last but not least his love and affection to his family. On one occasion, Lord Buddha mentioned that three types of persons are born into this world. The first, is very selfish and thinks only of ones self; the second, does everything for others and neglects himself; the third does good to others and good to himself. Raja belonged to the third category, which the Buddha said was the best of the three. As the curtain fell on his octogenarian life, our condolences go to his brother Upali, his wife Sakunthala and the rest of his family. There is no doubt that he shortened his journey in Samsara during his life spent in this world. May he attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana.

Australia cricket board threatens players with unemployment
MELBOURNE, Sunday: Australias cricket board has warned players will not be given alternative contracts if they fail to agree to a new collective bargaining agreement in an escalation of a protracted and increasingly bitter pay dispute.
Australias professional cricketers rejected a pay offer from the sports governing body last month, saying the proposal was a win for cricket administrators but a loss for cricket.
CA released their proposal in March, offering large salary increases, particularly for women, but breaking with the 20-year model of a fixed percentage of revenue from the game going to the cricketers.
Sutherland told the players association that they needed to meet terms with CA or players would go unpaid when the existing collective bargaining agreement expires on June 30.
In the absence of the ACA (Australian Cricketers Association) negotiating a new MoU (Memorandum of Understanding), players with contracts expiring in 2016-17 will not have contracts for 2017-18, Sutherland said in a letter received by the ACA on Friday.
To be very clear, in the absence of a new MOU, CA is not contemplating alternative contracting arrangements to pay players beyond 30 June if their contracts have expired.
Cricket Australia declined to comment further when contacted.
The ACA said in response that the threats... were a window into the nature of CAs behaviour in these negotiations so far.
There is incoherence and aggression in what we have experienced at the negotiating table from CA, ACA chief executive Alistair Nicholson said in a statement on Sunday.
This has further been demonstrated this week with some top players being offered multi-years deals one day only to now be threatened the next.
The ACA has asked CA to go into mediation talks to try to end a dispute that has rumbled for over six months.
Australia fast bowler Mitchell Starc hinted at a players strike for the upcoming Ashes, the lucrative five-test series against England which starts in November.
Makes for an interesting mens and womens ashes, Starc wrote on Twitter. Former test all-rounder Shane Watson responded: Well said @mstarc56 (Starc). It will be an interesting game of cricket without any players.
The current MoU will expire midway through the womens World Cup which starts in England and Wales on June 24.
The Australian womens World Cup squad will be paid in advance of the June/July World Cup and will be employed until the end of the event, Sutherland said. Former Australia captain Mark Taylor, a CA board member, said the ACA were not prepared to negotiate and that players had threatened to strike as far back as January.
Cricket Australia feel that the ACA arent negotiating at all, he told a sports chat show on cricket broadcaster Nine Network on Sunday.
I have had players say to me in January that we could well be on strike in July.  Agencies

They hired an award-winning destination photographer Charleton Churchill and click some really wonderful pictures. The 30-something couple trekked through harsh conditions to reach the base camp 17,000 ft above sea level for over three weeks to have the perfect shots they had desired for the perfect adventurous wedding.
While it was a first for the couple, Churchill had attempted a similar shoot in 2015 and had quite an idea about the terrain and the difficulties but managed to do it quite nicely to produce a wedding album they will cherish for life.

'Buddhas teachings help to create a better world': Nepal President

Nepal and Sri Lanka are excellent pearls hung in the Indian ocean which should have greater connectivity, said Nepal President Bidhya Devi Bhandari addressing the closing ceremony of the 14th UN Vesak Day Celebrations held at the premises of the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Dalada Maligawa) in Kandy last evening. She was the Chief Guest at the Closing Ceremony.
President Bhandari said that in recent years high level visits and participation at forums such as SAARC have led to bilateral relations between the two countries. She said that Sri Lanka have done much to promote Buddhism and the people of Sri Lanka have a special affinity with Nepal due to Buddhism. I hope that the deliberations and ideas that came at the conference would help spread Buddhism around the world.
She appreciated Late Minister Lakshman Kadirgamars effort for presenting the resolution at the UN to commemorate Vesak as an international event. President Bhandari also said that Nepal is proud that they fully supported the resolution.  Both countries have faced conflicts and the teachings of the Buddha such as tolerance, compassion, harmony have been guiding us through the civilizations. It has been proved that the power of the ballot is greater than the power of the bullet.
Buddha is the light of the world. We should practice his teachings to create a better world, said the President.
She said that Buddhas teachings help us to solve the hardships we face and create a peaceful world. As the home to Lumbini, the birth place of Buddha, we Nepalese are committed to world peace and it is linked to Nepals Identity. Nepal is home to 10 world heritage sites.
President Bhandari said that a Comprehensive Master Plan with Lumbini Development Trust is being developed. Under that a Gautam Buddha airport is being built as a holy place for peace and pilgrims for peace loving people.
In addition, Lumbini Buddhist University has also streamlined its academic activities.

China hosts Silk Road summit in shadow of N.Korea missile test
CHINA: China touted on Sunday its new Silk Road as a project of the century at a summit highlighting its growing leadership on globalisation, but a North Korean missile test threatened to overshadow the event.
President Xi Jinping was preparing to host leaders from 29 nations for the two-day summit in Beijing when US and South Korean military officials confirmed that Pyongyang had launched a ballistic missile.
Delegations from North Korea and the United States were expected at the forum, though not their leaders. Few Western heads of government made the trip.
The summit is showcasing Xis cherished One Belt, One Road initiative, a revival of the Silk Road that could cement Chinas growing global clout on trade and geopolitics.
This is indeed a gathering of great minds, Xi said, addressing leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Xi pledged to pump an extra $124 billion in funds into the initiative, calling it a project of the century in a world fraught with challenges.
The Chinese-bankrolled project seeks to link the country with Africa, Asia and Europe through an enormous network of ports, railways, roads and industrial parks.
The initiative spans some 65 countries representing 60 percent of the world population and around a third of global gross domestic product. The China Development Bank has earmarked $890 billion for some 900 projects.
The project is seen as a practical solution to relieve Chinas industrial overcapacity. But it could also serve Beijings geopolitical ambitions as Washington retreats into America First policies.
While Xi did not mention North Korea during his speech to the delegates, the Chinese foreign ministry issued a statement saying it opposes such missile tests.
It urged all parties to exercise restraint and refrain from further aggravating the tension in the region.
North Korea relies heavily on trade with China for its economic survival, and US President Donald Trump has urged Xi to use that leverage to put pressure on Pyongyang.
The White House called on all nations to impose far stronger sanctions following the latest test, which came days after South Korea elected a new president.
Sundays missile launch is absolutely an embarrassment to Beijing but it also shouldnt be overstated, Christopher Balding, economics professor at Peking University, told AFP.
This will not overshadow (the summit) in an enormous way but it will absolutely continue to raise US frustrations with Beijing, he said, adding that Washington was frustrated that North Korea was also invited to the summit.
Xi focused on his initiative, boasting that it represented a road for peace, but he cautioned all countries should respect each others sovereignty... and territorial integrity. He warned that isolation results in backwardness.
The new financing that he promised on Sunday includes 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) for the Silk Road Fund and lending schemes worth 380 billion yuan. He also urged financial institutions to contribute 100 billion yuan.
Praising Xis initiative, Putin warned that protectionism is becoming the norm.
The ideas of openness, trade freedom are rejected more and more, very often by those who were their supporters not so long ago, Putin said. For his part, Erdogan said Belt and Road was going to be the kind of initiative that will put an end to terrorism.

Are doctors strikes ethically justifiable
Lionel Wijesiris article captioned Are doctors strikes ethically justifiable is a balanced well-written piece of journalism. He emphasises he is writing the piece as a common citizen and, in that aspect, he has very well projected the average citizens viewpoint on doctors strikes.
I also agree that we need to analyse our doctors strikes, firstly, in terms of its reasons, modalities and its impacts. Secondly, we need to elaborate a general ethical reflection on doctors strikes using normative ethical framework. General ethical reflection must be based on the Hippocratic Oath and other codes, biomedical principles like beneficence, non-maleficence and autonomy, as well as ethical approaches like deontological and utilitarian reasoning, and traditional Sri Lankan philosophy.
Sri Lankan doctors strikes are morally not acceptable and ethically not allowable based on deontological reasoning and Hippocratic tradition. However, considering utilitarian reasoning, as Wijesiri points out, doctors strikes for fair wage, better hospital infrastructure and working conditions are justifiable if it causes less harm to present patients and gives more good to the future patients.
I suggest SLMC develop an appropriate framework developed to prevent doctors from taking a collective action. At the same time, in order to make health care system more efficient and problem free, government should develop appropriate strategies to support health care workers, including doctors, and it should be reviewed regularly so that the frequency and the severity of medical strikes will be minimized in the future.

Companions of your Heart
At no other time in my life had I kept recalling Chaucer's Canterbury Tales than in the months I lived in an apartment in New York. Even though I have always been an introvert my newfound alone time made me remember with awe how Chaucers garrulous pilgrims, virtual strangers when they first meet, chatted and revealed volumes about themselves on their journey to Canterbury. Even as I longed for the company of my family, my friends who made me laugh until my ribs ached, who even thought I was funny, but were not there with me, I wondered how people could reach out to perfect strangers and make friends so easily. I wondered how the Knight and the Wife of Bath did it. I wish I knew their secret.
Eight years later, I still haven't mastered the perfect art of making friends. But thanks to several research articles published in popular online websites I know that health and happiness cannot be found by turning to doctors, self-help books or herbal supplements. It appears the most powerful weapons that could help us fight illness and depression, slow aging and prolong life: are our friends.
Unfortunately, researchers are only now starting to pay attention to the importance of friendship and socializing in our overall well-being. A 10-year Australian study found that older people with a large circle of friends were 22 percent less likely to die during the study period than those with fewer friends. Last year, Harvard researchers reported that strong social ties could promote brain health as we age.
In general, the role of friendship in our lives isnt terribly well appreciated, says Rebecca G. Adams, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro. There are just scads of stuff on families and marriage, but very little on friendship. It baffles me. Friendship has a bigger impact on our psychological well-being than family relationships.
It is said that last year, researchers studied 34 students at the University of Virginia, taking them to the base of a steep hill and fitting them with a weighted backpack. They were then asked to estimate the steepness of the hill. Some participants stood next to friends during the exercise, while others were alone.
The students who stood with friends gave lower estimates of the steepness of the hill. And the longer the friends had known each other, the less steep the hill appeared.
People with stronger friendship networks feel like there is someone they can turn to, says Karen A. Roberto, Director of the center for gerontology at Virginia Tech. Friendship is an undervalued resource. The consistent message of these studies is that friends make your life better.
Knowing this is easy, but actually stepping out of the safety of our home to make friends is not. The biggest question most of us ask ourselves when we are among strangers, is, how do we break the ice Especially when we know since we never get a second chance to make a first impression, what is said in those first few moments is as significant as it often is tongue-tying. If you are one who stumbles  and falls  during those initial moments when you are meeting someone new, the best thing to do, according to an article in the Reader's Digest is to make a comment or statement, often followed by a question. This technique works especially well when you are with a group of people sharing a similar experience, such as waiting at the doctors office, attending a book launch, or standing in line at the supermarket. You can use the weather, your situation, or a request you may have, such as asking for directions or assistance (Hasn't it been awfully hot these days or can you tell me where the post office is) You can also say something more personal (I was just admiring your earrings. Did you buy them here) By making statements about surroundings or events, you establish a bond that readily and easily promotes dialogue.
But, could it be that you don't feel like talking about the weather or making personal comments Luckily there is another alternative. You can always fall back on a clich to make a new friend. Cliche's can be used frequently because they are effective and because they usually work well. You can use them just about any time, at any place from the bus halt to parties to business functions. It is easy to make a joke of using a clich, such as I cant believe Im actually going to say this, but do I know you from somewhere The important thing to remember though, is to be honest and sincere. The saying goes that what you say isnt as important as how you say it.
In other words, don't be afraid to be positive and encouraging. If someone is good at something then tell them so. If someone looks nice, or is well dressed, then say you think so. If you think someone is funny, or an interesting person, then let them know. Again, moderation is essential. The occasional genuine compliment is way better than a constant stream of falls ones.
Once the conversation gets going, you can interrelate more by gradually disclosing a little about yourself. This is best done in small doses, by asking and talking, asking, and talking. Avoid having one person monopolize the conversation, which can be as embarrassing as it is uncomfortable. And when things wrap up, use a polite good-bye. If things had gone well, find a way to get back in touch.
When we are making friends, experts say we should keep in mind that our friends don't have to share the same interests, because being different helps us learn new things from each other, and allows us to feel free to be ourselves. We should love our friends for what makes them unique, and never feel we have to be anything we are not, when we are with them.
As time goes by, it becomes inevitable that some friends grow together, others grow apart. As we go through life, our personalities, interests and circumstances can change too. This can mean we are not so suited to each other as we once were. This doesn't mean that our friendship wasn't a special part of our life, but it's OK to move on to new friendships and meet new people throughout our lives.
As Barbra Streisand once sang People who need people are the luckiest people in the world.
Hope you are one of the lucky ones.

How to make (and keep) New Friends
Be yourself
When you pursue hobbies and activities you enjoy, you have a good chance of meeting people with similar interests. So check out that local lecture on modern literature and sign up for dress-making lessons. Each event is a chance to make a whole new room full of like-minded buddies.Get up close and personal.
When youre just starting to get to know someone, foster intimacy by talking about something deeper than the weather. Once you two have been talking for a while, try what researchers call the Fast Friends techniquebasically each party gradually discloses something meaningful about him or herself. For example, each person could answer the question: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be
Be persistent.
While not everyone has the courage to actually do it, most of us know how to pursue a crush. Send flowers to their office. Invite them to a concert featuring a band you know they love. Ask them to check yes or no under the question will you go out with me (Oh wait, are we not in third grade anymore). Apply similar (but less romantic) tactics when pursuing a potential friend. For example, send the person an email asking them to lunch or a coffee date next week, and follow up afterward to say you had a good time.
Set a goal.
It might sound superficial, but the next time you go to a social function, tell yourself you want to leave with three new friends (or maybe even just one). That way, youll be more open to meeting people and starting in-depth conversations instead of just smiling at the person ahead of you in line for the bathroom.
Say cheese.
Seriously. Were including smiling on this list because its a more powerful tactic for making connections than you might believe. For one thing, smiling takes us out of our own head and makes us think more about the image we are projecting. Plus, people who smile (as opposed to folks with neutral faces) are perceived as more attractive, kinder, and happier, and therefore more approachable.

Creating a hillside meadow
Do you mow a hillside over and over, with little to show for your efforts If so, consider transforming the area into a care-free wildflower meadow. Heres how to do it:
A few reasons to make a hillside meadow
* A single annual mowing is usually sufficient to maintain such a meadow, rather than mowing it every several weeks.
* Meadow plants growing on a slope present an impressive picture that changes constantly as different species come in and out of bloom.
* Meadow gardens are always packed with intrigue. The show is a never-ending display of different plant combinations, usually pairing flowering plants with clump-forming grasses.
* The display is even more gratifying because very little site preparation goes into creating a meadow. When you seek out plants that thrive naturally in your climate and soil, the job is easy.
* After planting them once, many wildflowers multiply or reseed with no assistance on your part.
* You can use your saved time and energy to experiment with other flowers to add to the palette, fine-tuning your collection with each passing season.
Creating yard-sized meadows
Theyre somewhat wild and woolly by nature, so wildflower meadows are best located a short distance from your house, separated from it by a swath of neatly mown turf.
* It serves as an open area, allowing you to stand back and admire the view.
* It also acts as a buffer zone for wildlife, which is naturally drawn to wildflower meadows.
* A short fence also helps to set apart a wildflower area. Fences lend a sense of importance, too, making the meadow look like an intentional garden rather than a happy accident.
* Start small with a wildflower meadow and expand as you need room for a growing collection of plants.
* Many of the flowers listed here have such strong constitutions that they seldom fail when given an opportunity to grow.
Mowing your meadow
In the interest of neatness, and to control tree seedlings and other woody weeds that inevitably pop up, a meadow should be mowed at least once a year, preferably in late fall.
* This job may be too rough for a mower, but it is easily tackled by a gas-powered weed trimmer equipped with a blade.
* Allow the debris to lie on the ground through winter as a mulch.
* Seeds may germinate under its protection, and it will prevent soil erosion.
* In early spring, rake open patches, loosen the top centimetre (half-inch) of soil with a hoe and, if desired, plant seeds of annuals like poppies, cosmos and larkspur.
While creating a meadow might seem like a lot of work, it is sure to save you time and energy throughout the year -- not to mention it looks beautiful! If you want to brighten up your yard and save time on mowing, a hillside meadow is the perfect addition to your property. -yellowpages

Crying wolf
All stories are about wolves. All worth repeating, that is. Anything else is sentimental drivel, declares the nameless male protagonist of the nested novella in Margaret Atwoods The Blind Assassin. Lay that next to Harold Pinters much-quoted epitome that his plays are about the weasel under the cocktail cabinet. And finally Angela Carter, in her short story The Company of Wolves: We keep the wolves outside by living well.
What is the difference between a weasel and a wolf Perhaps its pedantic to make a distinction, if we accept that we are talking about latent menace. But of course the difference lies exactly in the pedantry, the precision, of weasel and cocktail cabinet as compared to the great shaggy archetype of the wolf. Contemporary fairy tales, from Carter and Atwood onwards, often seek to relaunch the wolf as an emblem of all the things we try to keep outside by living well. The cruelty and wildness inherent in sex, bodies, society; the animal at the heart of the predatory male or long-repressed female; the untamed subconscious. Ironically, through sheer over-exposure, these writers have domesticated the figure of the wolf and neutralized his menace. His teeth are pulled; his claws clipped. But a weasel  now, a weasel might still make you jump.
Intertextual references
In her introduction to the Vintage edition of The Bloody Chamber (1995), Helen Simpson gets all hot and sweaty fighting off possible objections to Carters short stories. Are they just a bunch of gussied-up fairy tales Oh, no theyre not: The Bloody Chamber is often  wrongly  described as a group of traditional fairy tales given a subversive feminist twist. In fact these are new stories, not retellings. Simpson reminds us that Carters self-described intention was to extract the latent content from the traditional stories and to use it as the beginnings of new stories. Does this perhaps sound a bit too simple Certainly not: Nearly all Carters writing is strikingly full of cultural and intertextual references  you could spend five years on an annotation of The Bloody Chamber. Daunted at the prospect of all those layers of meaning Never mind: Carter is good at surfaces, too. Once again, Simpson quotes Carter herself: Ive tried to keep an entertaining surface . . . so that you dont have to read them as a system of signification if you dont want to. And what about all the repetition in the collection The answer is that it is intentional, and very, very clever. Three disparate werewolf tales work and rework the story of Red Riding Hood, borrowing variants from different centuries, compulsively circling the figures of the werewolf, the old woman and the young girl.
Of course this is all catnip to A level students and academics. For the former, its a crash course in things-that-have-more-than-one-meaning. And for the latter, what could be better than a pile of borrowed variants from different centuries to sift through and analyse But for everyone else  werewolves Really Simpson praises the way that Carters imagination was fired by the landscapes and imagery of fairy tales . . . bloodstains and ravens feathers on snow, moonlight on a dust-grimed mirror, graveyards on Walpurgisnacht. Does this list fire your imagination, or do you find ravens feathers and dust-grimed mirrors clichd  and frankly rather boring
folkloric heritage
As soon as you have a young girl intercepted by a wolf on her way to Grandmothers house (as in Carters The Company of Wolves), then, however they interact, however the story ends, it is difficult to argue that this is anything more than a retelling. In theory, tellers of modern fairy tales are being ingeniously, subversively playful with the folkloric heritage we all know so well. (Think of Haydn, whose audience at Esterhzy was so familiar with his music that he was able to include formal musical puns.) But it is very hard to make this moth-eaten material new again. And in 2017 it is even harder, because Carters own success has encouraged so many imitations that the old stories are now wearing thinner than ever. Four of the five books under review mention Carter and/or Atwood in their publicity. The exception is Marisa Silvers Little Nothing, which instead tries to distance itself with the bold claim that the author takes readers to a place few novelists go, a netherworld between literature and fantasy .
unspecified time
In the case of the two novels by old-handers  Little Nothing and Neil Jordans Carnivalesque  it is tempting to detect a late-career laziness, a sense that fairy tales are low-hanging fruit. Silvers novel is indeed firmly in the Carterian tradition, patching together some of the most familiar stories in unfamiliar, feminist ways (so not that unfamiliar after all). Pavla Jancek is born to an elderly couple, Agta and Vclav, in an unnamed country at an unspecified time. To their shame and disappointment, she is a dwarf. The first twist Shes a pretty one. When most people hear of a dwarf, they imagine court jesters or circus clowns. But although her parents come to love their beautiful dwarf, theyd still like her to be a normal height, so they agree to let a charlatan doctor stretch her on a homemade rack.
The procedure is technically a success  Pavla is now a normal height  but she is also, subtly, a wolf. Subtly in the mode of Carters Wolf-Alice, of whom we learn that nothing about her is human except that she is not a wolf; it is as if the fur she thought she wore had melted into her skin and become part of it, although it does not exist. Similarly, Pavlas paramour Danilo cant work out whether shes woman or wolf. Together they end up working for the charlatan doctor in a travelling freak show (of course theres a travelling freak show). At first, Pavla is displayed as the Were-Woman, but Wolf Girl attracts more punters. It turns out there is nothing remarkable in peoples minds about the idea of a grown woman with hair on her face. Both Carters story and Silvers novel use the wolf-transformation to explore ideas surrounding adolescence, female identity and aesthetic norms. (Yawn.) Wolfish Pavla is, after all, the synthesis of two things men have a need to routinely destroy: animals and women  which is a modern fairy tale as oversimplified and over-told as the rest. Eventually Pavla eats the oppressive doctor and completes her transformation. The rest of the novel follows her and Danilo as they make their way separately through the world, Danilo now helplessly in love with a wild, language-less wolf. Allegory abounds. Go on, boy, fetch!
Jordan directed the film version of Carters The Company of Wolves and worked on the screenplay with her. His seventh novel, Carnivalesque, shares tent space with Nights at the Circus. Carters protagonist in that novel, Fevvers, may or may not have real wings growing out of her back; she makes her living, and her name, by working as an aerialiste in Colonel Kearneys circus. The magical creatures in Jordans less successful offering are near-immortal carnies who hide their supernatural powers by performing in the big top. Our protagonist is a sweet human boy called Andy whose parents are braced for him to change as he enters adolescence. They dont expect him to be changed, however  quite literally switched for his evil reflection in Burleighs Amazing Hall of Mirrors during a family outing to the carnival. Andy accepts his new life as a gravity-defying changeling just in time to do battle with the Dewman, fighting on the side of the carnies own Mulciber (the Hall of Mirrors is Pandmonium). Before long, we are up to our ears in Adam and Eve by way of Milton. There was an Eden from which carnies fell. A mirror of the biblical one. This is a story that, in Jordans hands, feels as tired as all those over-worked werewolves. Philip Pullmans Northern Lights trilogy has just as much Milton, and it is more expertly wielded, with ten times the invention and none of the pomposity. It is intended for teenagers, and it is cleverer, better. This is another difficulty with the fairy tale genre: it overlaps with fantasy and childrens stories, and is often outclassed by writers from these ostensibly less sophisticated modes. The much-parodied Twilight trilogy does a better job of rejuvenating the werewolf trope than does Marisa Silver; and J. K. Rowlings appropriation of mythology and the fairy tale is (whisper it) every bit as intricate as these more adult reworkings.
Benign nonsense
Sara Flannery Murphys debut novel, The Possessions, uneasily straddles the border between fantasy-thriller and something worthier. The result is benign nonsense, a book that delivers everything you expect from its tagline: Who will prevail  the woman or the ghost (Prevail!) The wicked fairy godmother here is Atwood, not Carter; we are in a conveniently detail-free dystopia in which our narrator Eurydice (not her real name) works for the madame-like Mrs Renard as a body. A body is a sort of prostitute-cum-medium who is paid to swallow a pill known as lotus; for a short amount of time, Eurydice effectively leaves her body to make room for the spirit of a clients dead loved one. Flannery makes heavyish weather of a body-related mystery involving a murder and a drowning. You sense that this is meant to be a more respectable, Atwoodian equivalent to Gone Girl, but its likely to end up thrilling neither camp.
The Possessions shows how even the peripheral presence of the fairy tale invites an automatic overwriting: a womans hair here is as black as a ravens wing; a mourners eyes are as dry and clear as shards of glass. Silver, Jordan and Carter herself all write from stock in this way, the get-out clause being that fairy tales are stock, silly, its all part of the act. But do you really want to watch Carter limping through this tired routine He was as rich as Croesus. A necklace is as cold as ice. His face was as still as ever Id seen it, still as a pond iced thickly over. (Compare Sara Flannery Murphy: Im an endless expanse of ice.) I felt as giddy as if I were on the edge of a precipice. The key slid into the new lock as easily as a hot knife into butter. His feral muzzle is sharp as a knife. (All of these are examples from stories in The Bloody Chamber.) - Times Literary Supplement

De Kock dominates South Africas awards
Quinton de Kock has been named South African Cricketer of the Year and also picked up four other titles at the annual awards.
De Kocks haul was one short of the six prizes handed to Kagiso Rabada last year. As well as being named Test Cricketer and ODI Cricketer of the Year, de Kock also earned the Players Player of the Year and the Fans Player of the Year. Imran Tahir was named the T20I Cricketer of the Year.
Sune Luus was named Womens Cricketer of the Year and their Players Player award went to Lizelle Lee. The international newcomer awards went to Keshav Maharaj and Laura Wolvaardt.
De Kocks year included a career-best ODI score of 178 against Australia as well as his Test century in Hobart which helped clinch the series victory last November. Tahirs T20 exploits included a career-best 5 for 24 against New Zealand at Eden Park.
Temba Bavuma and Rabada earned acknowledgment for individual moments of brilliance, which both came in the same match: Bavuma for his run out of David Warner at Perth and Rabada for the delivery which bowled Usman Khawaja.
What a year Quinton has had, Haroon Lorgat, the CSA chief executive, said. He has shown the maturity of a seasoned campaigner with performances that have really counted when needed most, often blowing away the opposition in the process.
It is encouraging that for the second time in a row our premier award has gone to one of our young stars who is shining with distinction alongside our world-class senior players.

Departing Younis, Misbah fall but Pakistan press for victory
ROSEAU, DOMINICA, Saturday - Departing stalwarts Younis Khan and captain Misbah ul Haq failed to make an impact in their farewell international innings but Pakistan were poised to press for a series-clinching victory over the West Indies at stumps on the fourth day at Windsor Park in Dominica on Saturday.
Following the tedium of the first three days which saw a total of 15 wickets falling, 14 tumbled on the penultimate day of the series, ending with the home side at seven for one after being set a daunting victory target of 304.
Mohammad Abbas claimed his first five-wicket haul in Test cricket to trigger a West Indies first innings collapse to 247 all out in the morning after they resumed at 218 for five with the match appearing at the start of the day to be dragging towards a dreary draw.
Eight seasons of first-class cricket bowling long spells prepared me for this opportunity, said Abbas.
I dedicate this performance to both Misbah and Younis because it is my great fortune to play with them but also unfortunate for it to be their last series.
In attempting to build on that considerable lead of 129 Pakistan crashed to 90 for seven before Yasir Shah, with a Test-best 38 not out, and a determined 27 from Mohammad Amir allowed Misbah the luxury of a second innings declaration at 174 for eight late in the day.
Shah and Amir put on 61 for the eighth wicket and benefited from the continuing West Indian epidemic of errors in the field. Shah was caught behind off a no-ball from leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo and two catches were missed as the tail wagged and the home side wilted.
Fast bowler Alzarri Joseph claimed three wickets but the West Indies failure to press home the advantage after getting Younis and Misbah cheaply proved costly.
Shah then turned the screws on his opponents when he removed Kieran Powell to a catch at silly point with what proved to be the final ball of an eventful day.
Abbas early demolition job gave Pakistan a match-winning platform although their top-order batting failed to build on that considerable advantage.
Shan Masood and Younis Khan added 49 for the third wicket in mid-afternoon before Shannon Gabriel took his second wicket of the innings in prising out Masood.
His demise ushered in Misbah for his last innings but there was to be no fairytale as he attempted to hoist Bishoo out of the ground in the leg-spinner's first over and succeeded only in getting a spiralling top-edge for wicketkeeper Shane Dowrich to take the catch.
Younis also succumbed to Bishoo just before tea for 35, his errant sweep being well caught by Powell diving at backward square-leg.
Pakistan looked set to squander their hard-earned lead when Sarfraz Ahmed and Asad Shafiq fell cheaply at the start of the final session but Shah and Amir rode their considerable luck in an entertaining partnership.
As well as they played though, the individual honours on the day belonged to Abbas.
Increasingly impressive in his first Test series, the fast-medium bowler took the last four wickets of the West Indies innings for three runs in a four-over spell after an early breakthrough from fellow pacer Amir to finish with the excellent figures of five for 46 off 25 disciplined overs.
Amir removed Dowrich to just the fourth ball of the day which brought in Roston Chase.
Forced to retire hurt on 60 the previous evening due to a blow on his right elbow, he was progressing in partnership with captain Jason Holder until Abbas replaced Amir from the pavilion end.
Chase was bowled off his pads for 69 by a full-length delivery and Bishoo then edged his first ball low to second slip where the ever-reliable Younis came up with his tenth catch of the series. That effort put him into the record books for the most catches ever by a Pakistani fielder in a Test series. - AFP

Drinking raw milk could be DEADLY!
A new craze for raw milk and cheese that hasnt been pasteurised has put thousands at risk of severe food poisoning, experts warn.
Most milk in the supermarket is pasteurised, meaning that it has been heated to high temperatures in order to kill harmful bacteria.
But raw milk, which has not gone through this process, is rising in popularity in the US and the UK with sellers claiming it has a better taste and is more nutritious.
A US study has now found that 750 people are taken ill after consuming raw dairy products every year and people who drink raw milk are 840 times more likely to get sick.
Experts from the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have now spoken out against this new healthy eating fad.
There are several different types of food poisoning in the UK, all with slightly different symptoms - and levels of severity.
The growing popularity of unpasteurised milk in the United States raises public health concerns, experts from the CDC said in a research paper.
Outbreaks associated with dairy consumption cause, on average, 760 illnesses/year and 22 hospitalisations/year, mostly from Salmonella and Campylobacter.
Unpasteurised milk, consumed by only 3.2 per cent of the population, and cheese, consumed by only 1.6 per cent of the population, caused 96% of illnesses caused by contaminated dairy products.
In the US, 3.2 per cent of supermarket milk is unpasteurised and in the UK, around 200 farms have taken to selling raw dairy, according to the Guardian.
Enthusiasts claim raw milk has a more authentic taste and may even be more nutritious and higher in vitamins.
But a new study has found that those who drink raw milk are 45 times more likely to end up in hospital.
Raw milk can cause food poisoning because it is more likely to be contaminated with harmful bacteria that is normally removed during the pasteurisation process.
Researchers found that people who were hospitalised after drinking raw milk were most likely to be infected by Salmonella or a bacteria called Campylobacter.
As consumption of unpasteurized dairy products grows, illnesses will increase steadily, the researchers concluded.
Most milk in the supermarket is pasteurised, meaning that it has been heated to high temperatures in order to kill harmful bacteria (pictured is an artists illustration of bacteria)
A doubling in the consumption of unpasteurized milk or cheese could increase outbreak-related illnesses by 96 per cent.
British experts have also spoken out against drinking raw milk milk.
Unpasteurised or raw milk and raw cream may contain harmful bacteria that cause food poisoning, the UKs Food Standards Agency said on its website.
If you have a weakened immune system, you are particularly vulnerable to food poisoning and should not consume unpasteurised milk and cream.
Vulnerable groups include pregnant women, infants and children.
The research is to be published in the journal Emerging Infectious Disease. -Daily Mail.uk

Eager to taste!
Sapodilla is an astonishingly potent fruit that can be ranked alongside Guava when it comes to having medical properties that can make a real difference in ones health. Garden Talk talks to Director of Institute of Indigenous Medicine Dr. Swarna Hapuarachchi who furnished us with information on this fruit.
The Sapodilla/ Sapota is an evergreen tree which reaches up to 60 - 100 ft. The tree yields the flowers throughout the year. The leaves are oblong-lanceolate to ovate-elliptic, medium green, glossy. Leaves are 2 to 5 inches (520 cm) long, stiff, pointed, and clustered at the ends of shoots. Sapodilla/ Sapota composes of soft, easily digestible pulp made of simple sugars like fructose and sucrose. Sapodilla trees are well adapted to subtropical and tropical climates. The leaves are pinkish when newly emerged and light green to dark green at maturity. The flowers are small, white and bell-shaped. The tree yields flowers throughout the year. Each small branch is arranged horizontally or drooping, said Hapuarachchi.
Sapodilla or sapota thought to have originated in the Central American rain forests, Today, it is grown in our country as well as India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The tree is fast growing, wind and drought resistant, and it flourishes well even under dry arid regions.
Sweet and pleasant in taste, each sapodilla fruit is a berry - round or oval and measures about 10 cm in diameter and weigh about 150 g. A tree bears as many as 2,000 fruits per year. Sapota fruit has a gray/brown, sandy outer surface. Unripe fruits possess white, hard, inedible pulp that secretes sticky latex. This milky latex gradually disappears, and its white flesh turns brown as the fruit ripens. Once ripen, it becomes soft, acquires a sweet taste and smooth or grainy texture with slight musky flavor. It contains about 3-10 black, smooth, shiny inedible seeds, located in the center, stated Hapuarachchi
SAPODILLA NUTRIONAL VALUES
Sapota fruit is abundant in nutrients, vitamins, minerals, glucose, tannins and calories. Ripened sapota is a great source of minerals like potassium, copper, iron and vitamins. These compounds are essential for optimal health as they are involved in various metabolic processes in the body. All these are vital for overall health. Sapodilla is high in antioxidant rich vitamin C
The nutritional value of Sapodilla in 241 grams of the fruit are as 
Calories (200 Kcal)Dietary Fiber (12.8 g)Fat (2.65 g)Protein (1.06 g)Carbohydrate (48.1 g)Calcium (51 mg)Water (187.98 g)Magnesium (29 mg)Iron (1.93 mg)Potassium (465 mg)Phosphorous (29 mg)Pantothenic acid (0.607 mg)Vitamin C (35.4 mg)Folate (34 g)Niacin (0.482 mg)Vitamin A (7 g).
Health Benefits
The Fiber content helps relieve constipation episodes and help protect the colon from cancer-causing toxins. Fiber is essential to improve the digestion. Insoluble fiber assists to pass the stool and bulk through the body
The fruit is rich in Tannin. Research studies suggest that tannins are shown to have potential anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-parasitic effects. Hence, these compounds may be used in traditional medicines as hemostasis and as a remedy for piles. Sapota contains a good amount of antioxidant vitamins like vitamin C and vitamin A. Vitamin-A is essential for vision. Consumption of natural fruits rich in vitamin-A has been known to offer protection from lung and oral cavity cancers. So also, consumption of foods containing vitamin-C helps the body develop resistance against infectious agents. The presence of Vitamin C enhances the immune system to counteract the viruses. Vitamin C helps to prevent the chances of lung infections and pneumonia. Sapodilla helps to relieve stress. The study analysis shows that Vitamin C helps the weakened immune system which is caused due to stress. Prevents anemia & Proper function of brain - Anemia is caused due to the deficiency in iron. The body cant produce hemoglobin and transport oxygen due to inadequate presence of iron. The patients of anemia experience the symptoms such as poor mental function, lack of energy and apathy and poor- memory. The deficiency in iron results in restless, irritable and inattentive behavior. Copper assist in Galactose and Dopamine which are the neurotransmitters essential to maintain energy, mood, outlook and focus. Potassium is vital for the cellular function, nerve impulses and electrical signals that the brain depends on. Potassium deficiency leads to poor concentration, fatigue, trouble in remembering and learning and change in mood.It Reduces arthritis and assists in maintaining a healthy skeletal structure -Copper possess anti-inflammatory properties which eliminates stiffness and pain related to arthritis. It helps to strengthen muscles, lower the joint pain and repairs the connective tissue. Copper is essential for the growth of bones, connective tissue and muscles. The deficiency of copper increases the chances of osteoporosis, muscle weakness, low strength, breakage and weak joints
It helps heal wounds - The recent studies show that Vitamin B5 accelerates the healing process by improving the multiplication of cells. Pastes are often made from the seeds to make remedies that can be applied to stings and bites.Good For The Eyes - Sapota contains a high amount of Vitamin A. According to research, Vitamin A helps in improving vision even during old age. Source Of Energy - Sapota is rich in glucose which provides instant energy to the body. Prevention Of Certain Cancers - The antioxidants, dietary fiber and nutrients found in Sapota provide protection against cancer. Vitamin A provides protection from lung and oral cavity cancers.Benefits During Pregnancy -Having a high dose of carbohydrates and essential nutrients, sapota is extremely beneficial for pregnant and lactating mothers. It helps in reducing symptoms of pregnancy such as nausea and dizziness.Haemostatic Properties - The Sapota herb is known for its haemostatic properties. It is beneficial in reducing bleeding in case of piles and injuries. The ground seeds can be applied as a paste for alleviating stings and bites from venomous animals.Anti-Diarrheal - A decoction made by boiling this fruit in water can cure diarrhea. Mental Health - Sapota fruit helps to calm the nerves and alleviate stress. Thus, it is advisable for individuals suffering from insomnia, anxiety and depression.Kidney Stones - The crushed seeds of this fruit act as a diuretic, thus helping to expel bladder and kidney stones. It provides protection against kidney diseases as well.
Though it is not popular in Sri Lankan traditional medical systems, it has been used in other countries in their traditional medical systems. In Indonesia, the flowers of the tree are used to make a powder which is applied to a womans body following childbirth. In Cambodia, even the trees bark which contains tannins is used as a remedy for fever and diarrhea. The infusion of the young fruits and flowers helps to soothe the pulmonary ailments, pointed out Hapuarachchi.
Though Sapodilla is no doubt nutritious, one must avoid eating the unripe fruit and avoid consuming in excess.
Eating unripe fruits may cause mouth ulcers, itchy sensation in the throat, and breathing difficulty. The intake of unripe Sapodilla causes an irritation in the throat, breathing problems and mouth ulcer. Raw Sapodilla possesses bitter taste due to the high amount of latex and tannins. The excessive amount of Sapodilla causes the discomfort and pain in the abdomen, warned Hapuarachchi.
Hapuarachchi also pointed out that consuming a Sapota fruit can make your skin look beautiful!
Sapota fruit helps to make your skin glow, thus reducing your requirement of skin care products. Studies show that Vitamin B5 also slows down the aging process such as dark spots and wrinkles. The Vitamin E in this fruit moisturizes your skin, thus giving you healthy and beautiful skin. Sapota fruit is rich in antioxidants. Therefore, it acts as an anti-ageing agent by eradicating free radicals in the body which are responsible for enhancing the ageing process. The seed kernel oil of Sapota is used as a skin ointment. The residue of this seed, after the extraction of oil, can be applied on a cloth over painful skin afflictions. The milky sap of the sapota plant can be used to remove warts and fungal growth on the skin, added Hapuarachchi.
The tree has ornamental value and may be used for landscaping. Fresh sapodilla should be eaten when it turns soft. Cut the fruit into two halves, then scoop the flesh using a spoon and discard the seeds. It should be enjoyed without any additions in order to experience its unique flavor. Fresh sapota sections are a great addition to fruit salads.Sapodilla-milk shakes/smoothie is a favorite drink in Asia.It is also used in ice-creams, fruit-jam, cakes and pies. In the stores, buy fresh sapodilla with smooth, intact skin and without cuts/cracks, bruises or wrinkles. Once ripened, the fruit just yields to gentle thumb pressure.
Mature but unripe fruits must be kept at room temperature for 7 to 10 days to ripen. Firm, ripe sapodillas can keep well for several days in the home refrigerator and if set at 35 F, they can be kept for up to six weeks.If you do not know the time of fruit maturity, you may wait until a fruit drops and then begin to harvest those of similar size. Indicators of maturity is a change in skin color from brown to amber.

Emirates Group records US$ 670 mn profit in 2016-17
The Emirates Group has announced its 29th consecutive year of profit and steady business expansion, despite a turbulent year for aviation and travel.
The Emirates Group posted an AED 2.5 billion (US$ 670 million) profit for the financial year ending 31 March 2017, down 70% from last years record profit. The Groups revenue reached US$ 25.8 billion, an increase of 2% over last years results, and the Groups cash balance decreased by 19% to US$ 5.2 billion mainly due to the repayment of two bonds on maturity and ongoing high investments into its fleet and aircraft related assets.
In line with the current business climate and to support the future investment plans of the Group, no dividend payment will be made to the Investment Corporation of Dubai (ICD) for 2016-17.
Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive, Emirates Airline and Group, said: Emirates and dnata have continued to deliver profits and grow the business, despite 2016-17 having been one of our most challenging years to date.
In 2016-17, the Group collectively invested US$ 3.7 billion in new aircraft and equipment, the acquisition of companies, modern facilities, the latest technologies, and staff initiatives.
These investments will further strengthen our resilience, even as we extend our competitive edge, and adapt our businesses to the volatile business climate and fast changing consumer expectations.
Across its more than 80 subsidiaries and companies, the Group increased its total workforce by 11% to over 105,000-strong, representing over 160 different nationalities. Emirates total passenger and cargo capacity crossed the 60 billion mark, to 60.5 billion ATKMs at the end of 2016-17, cementing its position as the worlds largest international carrier.
Emirates received 35 new aircraft, its highest number during a financial year, comprising of 19 A380s and 16 Boeing 777-300ERs. At the same time 27 older aircraft were phased out, bringing its total fleet count to 259 at the end of March.
Against significant currency devaluations against the US dollar and fare adjustments due to a highly competitive business environment, Emirates managed to keep its revenue stable at AED 85.1 billion (US$ 23.2 billion).
Total operating costs increased by 8% over the 2015-16 financial year. Overall passenger traffic growth continues to demonstrate the consumer desire to fly on Emirates state-of-the-art aircraft, and via efficient routings through its Dubai hub.
Emirates carried a record 56.1 million passengers (up 8%), and achieved a Passenger Seat Factor of 75.1%.To fund its fleet growth in a year of record aircraft deliveries, Emirates raised US$ 7.9 billion, using a variety of financing structures. Emirates closed the financial year with a US$ 4.3 billion of cash assets. Europe was the highest revenue contributing region with AED 23.9 billion (US$ 6.5 billion), unchanged from 2015-16.
Emirates SkyCargo continues to play an integral role in the companys expanding operations, contributing 13% of the airlines total transport revenue.
Emirates SkyCargos total freighter fleet remained unchanged, with 15 aircraft: 13 Boeing 777Fs, and two Boeing 747-400Fs.
Emirates hotels recorded revenue of US$ 201 million, an increase of 5% over last year in a highly competitive market mainly in the UAE.
Revenue from dnatas UAE Airport Operations, including aircraft and cargo handling increased by 6% to reach US$ 823 million. Revenue from dnatas Travel Services division has seen a slight decline of 5% to AED 3.1 billion (US$ 854 million).

Ex-women cadre as armed virgins
The reference in the title is to those classified as ex-LTTE female cadre. Peter Schalk, in his article Tiger Women, says that 8 per cent of LTTE cadres killed in combat in the period 1982-1991 were women. The trigger for this article was a report in the Ravaya recently on former female cadre and their predicament where a woman speaks of how she was forcibly taken away coming from school and lived after being injured in the final days of the war in 2009. She speaks of coming back with the pain of surviving sexual advances of fellow cadre in bunkers. She survives with children taken care of by her father since her husband had left her for another woman.
LTTE women: is this liberation
The sub title is from the Rajani Thiranagama Memorial lecture by Radhika Coomaraswamy in 1997. She goes on to say, I do not believe that inducting women into a fighting force is a step towards empowerment and equality. Whatever reservations we may have about the overall militarisation of women, there is no doubt that the actual role of women in Tamil society has been drastically altered. Once peace returns, will Tamil society revert to casteism and oppressive sexist practices A cursory glance at the Tamil diaspora in other countries seems to imply that once people leave the atmosphere of war and return to some semblance of peace, the rituals and practices return. The LTTE privileges two types of women - the militant mother and the armed virgin.
The Ravaya story basically says when you keep four men with a female on bunker duty in the jungle the men were not focused on keeping the bunker safe.
Pushing back further, the label of female cadre is as wrong as that of a male cadre.
Conscription
DBS Jeyaraj in a piece in 2010 reports -, Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF), Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front (ENDLF) and Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) created a civilian volunteer force cum Tamil National Army. The LTTE adopted such methods after 1995. The LTTE and later its off-shoot the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Puligal (TMVP) took conscription to new heights or depths. Most of the surrendees therefore were forcibly recruited conscripts or unwilling volunteers.
The LTTE had insisted that each family in the Wanni had to provide one recruit to the LTTE. In the latter stages the Tigers demanded two per household. It became an accepted norm that no family dared refuse or defy. In a spirit of self-sacrifice boys and girls would opt to join the movement and thus protect other siblings from being recruited. Brothers would opt to join so that their sisters would be spared. Elder sisters would join in place of younger sisters. Usually siblings would decide that the cleverer among them should not be deprived of higher education and so the comparatively less studious ones would join thereby enabling the others to continue with studies. Thousands of youths were virtual cannon fodder and had perished like sacrificial lambs.
Families hid kids in wells, trees and even stacks of paddy or were forcibly married off to prevent being conscripted.
Rehabilitation and re-integration
The final count was 11,696 comprising 594 children and 11,102 adults. The children consisted of 363 boys and 231 girls. The adults consisted of 9,078 men and 2024 women. One thousand one hundred and seventy of the surrendees were disabled persons having lost limbs in the war. They were released and allowed to be with their families. These included some hard core Tigers and senior leaders. Likewise persons over the ages of 50 were also released. One hundred and forty eight among the surrendees were University students from Jaffna. Later 51 female undergrads were released and allowed to resume studies in Jaffna. This was followed by 97 male undergrads.
Most of Sri Lankan society accepted the label of ex-cadre. The grim reality was youth male and female lost out on their teens because they were conscripted or sacrificed themselves to save siblings.
Within which are the stories of what girls underwent. Any truth telling process must listen to the antecedents and narratives of the survivors. As Jeyaraj says thousands perished as cannon fodder. The agony of their surviving families need to heard.
Our rehabilitation process subject to correction has never looked at the surrenderees amongst who were conscripts as victims. All were classified as former cadre.
This writer believes that re-integration and restorative justice must take into account the manner in which Tamil groups conscripted youth, taking away their teens as civilians. Those fortunate to survive live but are scarred.
It does seem the LTTE was not really serious about having armed virgins when the boys were essentially interested in having sex with their female counterparts in closed, cloistered surroundings. The truth of this assertion can be validated if we were to take time listen to their stories not merely to document but rather to recognize the horror they went through and for many of us to recognize and acknowledge our failure to prevent such crimes from occurring in thousands of cases with impunity.
This writer is privy to concepts such as Children Zones of Peace and the work of the UN to prevent children being used in armed conflict which were unsuccessful in Sri Lanka. Its cause for collective shame and time to open another aspect of truth seeking in our goal for restorative justice.
Radhikas question in 1997 when she asks, will Tamil society revert to casteism and oppressive sexist practice is relevant in that Tamil society it seems accepts some have suffered but it stops there. If not we should have done more for them by now.

GSP+ to open 1,400 SL products to 17 EU countries
The European Council granting the Generalized System of Preferences Plus (GSP+) tariff concession to Sri Lanka allowing Sri Lanka to export over 1,400 products tax-free to the European market is a major victory for Sri Lanka.
Speaking to Daily News Business the Secretary and former President of Free Trade Zone Manufactures Association, Dhammika Fernando said that this is a result of good foreign policy maintained by the government and credit should go for it.
He said granting the GSP+ facility would allow buyers from 17 countries in EU to purchase Sri Lanka products minus a duty component between 2 to 12.5%. Firstly this would result in our buyers enjoying a bigger margin of profits which will entice them from buying more from Sri Lanka. Secondly it would also lure both local and foreign entrepreneurs to invest more in Sri Lanka and create more employment opportunists.
The European Parliament last month voted to approve granting the GSP+ tariff concession to Sri Lanka again as they believed that Sri Lanka has improved on their human and labor rights and on good governance.The EU is Sri Lankas biggest export market accounting for nearly one-third of Sri Lankas global exports. In 2015, total bilateral trade amounted to Euro 4.7 billion. The facility was withdrawn in 2010 due to the poor human rights record of the country.
The suspension of the GSP Plus in 2010 resulted in several SME apparel sector companies (not in the KIPZ) shutting down and over 10,000 jobs being terminated.
He however said that the EU buyers during the time looked at other sourcing markets like, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Egypt, Ethiopia and African countries which has now resulted in Sri Lanka having to fight hard to get some of the business back. This is a tall order since the chips have changed.
He also said that even Sri Lanka companies extended their operations to Ethiopia and African countries since they found it cheaper to manufacture and send to Europe.
Fernando also said that the exporters to EU did not have an advantage with regard to a stronger dollar since the Euro was not very strong.
However with the regaining of GSP Plus there would be additional revenue to Sri Lanka which would help to somewhat narrow the import export gap which is not at all impressive.

Halep outlasts Mladenovic to retain Madrid Open title
MADRID, Saturday: Simona Halep won the Madrid Open for the second consecutive year after staving off a fightback from Kristina Mladenovic, of France, to win 7-5, 6-7 (5), 6-2 in a thrilling marathon three-setter on Saturday.
The third seed produced her best tennis in the decider after edging the first set and being pegged back in the second by 14th seed Mladenovic, who was playing in her first final at premier mandatory level, the grade immediately below Grand Slam tournaments.
Romanian Halep was playing in her third Madrid final in four years, having lost the 2014 showpiece to Maria Sharapova, and her victory made her the second woman to retain the title after Serena Williams in 2013.
Halep took an even first set but grew frustrated in the second as Mladenovic came roaring back and the Romanian was given a code violation for throwing her racket in frustration in the direction of a ball boy at 30-0 down in the 12th game.
Mladenovic got off to a strong start in the tie-break and took the second set after winning two long rallies. But she had expended most of her energy and could not keep up with Halep, who served out the match in style by winning the game to love.  Agencies

HIV life expectancy near normal
Young people on the latest HIV drugs now have near-normal life expectancy because of improvements in treatments, a study in The Lancet suggests.
Twenty-year-olds who started antiretroviral therapy in 2010 are projected to live 10 years longer than those first using it in 1996, it found.
Doctors say that starting treatment early is crucial to achieve a long and healthy life.
Charities say there are still too many people unaware they have the virus.
This is particularly true in the developing world, where the majority of HIV deaths occur because access to drugs is limited.
More effective prevention
The study authors, from the University of Bristol, said the extraordinary success of HIV treatments was a result of newer drugs having fewer side effects and being better at preventing the virus from replicating in the body. It is also more difficult for the virus to build up a resistance to the most recent drugs.
Improved screening and prevention programmes and better treatment of health problems caused by HIV are thought to have helped, too.
But many people with HIV still do not live as long as expected, especially those infected through injecting drugs.
Antiretroviral therapy involves a combination of three or more drugs which block the normal progress of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).
They have been called one of the greatest public health success stories of the past 40 years.
Drugs do work
Jimmy Isaacs, 28, discovered he had been infected with HIV by a former partner nearly three years ago.
He takes three drugs once a day at 18:00 and will continue to do so for the rest of his life.
My health is absolutely fine. Im eating healthily and drinking healthily, he said.
It doesnt impact on my job and hasnt impacted on my social life either.
Although it took two changes of medication to find the right combination for him, he says he now has no side effects at all.
I had heard a lot of bad stories about the drugs back in the 90s - but when I did some research, I realised the drugs had completely changed.
Not all his employers have been supportive since his diagnosis and he says that is down to ignorance. His current employer has given him time off to tour the country and speak to students and school pupils about HIV prevention and treatment.
The researchers looked at 88,500 people with HIV from Europe and North America who had been involved in 18 studies.
They based their life-expectancy predictions on death rates during the first three years of follow-up after drug treatment was started.
They found that fewer people who started treatment between 2008 and 2010 died during this period compared with those who began treatment between 1996 and 2007.
The expected age at death of a 20-year-old patient starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) after 2008, with a low viral load and after the first year of treatment, was 78 years - similar to the general population.
What is antiretroviral therapy
Image copyright Science Photo Library
Image caption Antiretroviral therapy combines three or more drugs which stop the HIV virus from progressing
First used in 1996, it involves a combination of three or more drugs that stop the HIV virus from replicating
This means damage to the immune system caused by HIV can be prevented and it stops the disease spreading to others
More recent drugs are even more efficient and have fewer side effects
The World Health Organization recommends that antiretroviral therapy is started as soon as possible after diagnosis
Dr Michael Brady, medical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said the study showed how much things had changed since the start of the HIV epidemic in the 1980s.
But he said it also meant people aged over 50 now represented one in three of all those living with HIV.
As it stands, the healthcare, social care and welfare systems simply arent ready to support the increasing numbers of people growing older with HIV.
We need a new model of care to better integrate primary care with HIV specialist services, and we need a major shift in awareness and training around HIV and ageing, so that were ready to help older people live well in later life, he said.
Medical achievement
Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: Its a tremendous medical achievement that an infection that once had such a terrible prognosis is now so manageable, and that patients with HIV are living significantly longer.
We hope the results of this study go a long way to finally removing any remaining stigma associated with HIV, and ensuring that patients with HIV can live long and healthy lives without experiencing difficulties in gaining employment and - in countries where it is necessary - obtaining medical insurance.
She said steps were being taken to increase appropriate HIV testing by GPs.
The proportion of people with undiagnosed HIV has fallen steadily over the past 20 years.
But one in eight people with HIV is still thought to remain undiagnosed. -BBC

Indian Premiers speech at Norwood indirectly supports separatism: NUTA
The National University Lecturers Association in a press release issued yesterday said it considered the speech delivered by visiting Indian Prime Minister Nardera Modi at Norwood, Hatton as a prop to separatism in the country.
The media release issued by Association General Secretary Dr. Channa Jayasumana said.
The inference made by Modi that the Plantation Tamil Community in Sri Lanka were upholding Indian culture would dissuade the community from integrating into Sri Lankan culture.
Maintenance of an Indian culture in Sri Lanka was contradictory to the reconciliation policy of the Sri Lanka government.
It was also wrong on the part of Modi to describe plantation Tamils of Indian origin as part of an Indian diaspora. This would create a wrong mentality among up country plantation Tamils, who are citizens of Sri Lanka rather than part of an Indian diaspora.
What could be elicited from Modis entire speech is that he considered plantation Tamils in Sri Lanka s a community in another Indian state rather than a community in a neighbouring state.
The association considered, therefore, the Modis speech as an attempt to sow the seeds of another separatist movement in Sri Lanka.
Northern terrorist outfits created by Indian Politics and secret services caused immense destruction to the lives of people of all communities in the country and vital national assets.
It was the duty of all to ensure that a repetition of such destruction was not caused in the hill country, the press release said.

A delegation of 2OR Buddhist Charity Organization called on President Maithripala Sirisena to discuss about its future philanthropic activities in Sri Lanka at the Presidents official residence in Colombo on Saturday (May 13).
The leader of the delegation Master Jun Hong Lu, President of Australia Oriental Radio and Television announced a contribution of Rs 7.5 million for any Buddhist educational activities for youth. This could be used for any youth educational activity of the Presidents choice, he said.
He said his charity organization is linked to more than 50 Buddhist charity institutions all over the world and would like to contribute to promote Buddhism and carry forward the message of the Buddha to the younger generation.
He said that his organization has already donated towards constructing the Museum in Polonnaruwa.
The President said delegates from more than 70 countries attended the 14th UN Vesak Day celebrations and the Buddhist Conference being held in Sri Lanka.
He said the government would explore the possibility of setting up an International Buddhist organization to propagate Theravada Buddhism to the world.
Endorsing Master Jung Hon Lus efforts for educating Buddhism to youths, the President said the endeavour of his government is to improve the moral values of the younger generation through the teachings of the Buddha. He thanked the 2OR Charity Organization for the generous donations given for Buddhist educational activities and for the Polonnaruwa Museum and said he was a proud resident of Polonnaruwa, the ancient kingdom in which the vast majority of people are occupied in agriculture and live a simple life in accordance with the teachings of the Buddha.
President Sirisena said the Buddhas teachings are relevant for the conflict ridden world today as Buddhism has answers to any socio political issues in the present era.

IOC officials begin Paris visit to study 2024 bid
Paris: The 11 members of the International Olympic Committee's Evaluation Commission on Sunday began a three-day visit of Paris as they study the French capital's bid to host the 2024 Games.
Paris, which last hosted the Games in 1924, is competing against Los Angeles, with the IOC due to a hold a vote in Lima on September 13 to decide on the winning bid.
The Evaluation Commission completed a three-day tour of Los Angeles on Friday.
"Paris has a special place in the Olympic movement," said Switzerland's Patrick Baumann, chairman of the IOC's Evaluation Commission with a nod to the first Olympic Congress, which took place at the city's Sorbonne University in 1894.
It was also the birthplace of Pierre de Coubertin, the IOC's founder.
"Now this beautiful city is building on that heritage. Paris is a special city and everybody in this commission has a special attachment with this city."
The visit began on the day Emmanuel Macron, who has given his firm backing to the city's candidacy, was inaugurated as French president, succeeding Francois Hollande.
Macron intends to meet the Evaluation Commission during their visit, according to Paris 2024 co-chairman Tony Estanguet, a former Olympic canoeing champion.
The first day of the visit was expected to be dedicated to a host of meetings, including to assess the likely heritage left by a Games in Paris.
The Olympic movement is eager to avoid the spectacle seen from recent Games of white elephant venues left to fall into disuse.
The IOC visit will continue on Monday with visits to the city's iconic and sporting sites set to feature during the Games, before concluding on Tuesday. AFP

It pays to impress if you dress for success!
Beginning with first impressions, no aspect of workplace manners should be overlooked. It all starts with appearance and good grooming. It includes eye contact, a smile, using the customers name, a genuine desire to please and a great attitude. Proper professional attire transmits a far important message about you as a skilled business person or professional than you may imagine.
But remember that one size does not fit all in the workplace. Your wardrobe should be governed by the industry in which you work and the climatic environment in which you operate. But the most significant aspect about your dress sense is whether it meets with the approval of your clients.
Not everyone is aware that clothes convey a secret language of their own. They communicate far more than we realise. Good impressions count. Being sloppy or inappropriately dressed may just harm your image in more ways than one. Sending the wrong message about yourself could jeopardise your chances of an upwardly mobile career.
Dressing etiquette
The more perceptive will not have failed to observe that people who fraternise both socially and in commerce or industry dress similarly. Yes they realise the importance of speaking the same language in clothing. That is part of dress etiquette which must never be forgotten.
Dressing etiquette is the way we communicate with our attire. Sartorial elegance has much to do with outfitting oneself appropriately for the occasion. Sri Lankans have still not been able to throw off the mantle of the colonial mindset as far a sensible dress code goes. Before the wide variety of clothing fads, gentlemen wore suits everywhere and ladies wore dresses or saree. Now with the immense clothing preferences, some people simply dont seem to be able to figure out when and where to tog themselves out in casual or formal clothing.
Your personal appearance is not only an important factor in how you present yourself to others. The way you dress reflects the importance you attach to the situations and people around you. If your clothes are unclean or wrinkled, you may appear to be careless and uninterested in the business situation or people you are interacting with.
Of course, that goes without saying, if you want to dress aptly, you will have to exercise good judgement for the occasion and be aware of the dress code, whether it is stated explicitly or not. Jeans and tee-shirt are not appropriate wear for the office or for conducting business negotiations. Certain business seminar and event organisers do indicate a dress code even for informal dress-down events without being specific. These are some of the new dress codes I have come across. They include Corporate casual, Business casual, Smart casual and Resort casual. Dont leave invitees confused about your events dress code.
The right posture and poise
The first impression of any individual is created by external appearance. Even products are thoughtfully packed for instant appeal. It is imperative that we take utmost care of our appearance of which our clothes and grooming are an integral part.
The trick is to be appropriately dressed for any occasion. Care should be taken that one is neither over or under dressed. The minimum requirement is that clothes should be ironed. Women have an array of clothes to choose from, However in order to create a positive impact senior executives should wear either a saree or a business suit comprising a jacket, shirt, and skirt.
A trouser if not well tailored looks clumsy. Middle-level executives could also follow the same dress code. They also have the option of wearing salwar suits. Women should take care that clothes are not revealing. Low cut blouses and short skirt lengths should be strictly avoided. Bright, gaudy colours for morning events should be precluded and pastels should be preferred.
Still, being aware of what is suitable to wear necessitates as much good taste as it does to dress stylishly. Some of us may imagine our grooming is already immaculate and that we carry ourselves with the right posture and poise. However self-assured we can be in such an event there is a difference. That is because knowing what is appropriate to wear is decidedly not the same as knowing how to dress elegantly.
Good looking
Also, remember that daytime clothes are different from evening clothes. Similarly, evening clothes are worn in the after sundown and never in the day. For day-time wear chose light-coloured clothes such as whites, beige or pastels. Dark colours are too harsh for the daytime. Women should also wear only natural looking make up, with minimal jewellery, unless you are attending a glamorous day event. Low to medium heels are appropriate.
Remember always that when it comes to dressing appropriately for any occasion, your first consideration should be for your hosts. They have put together this event, planned it, and invited you. The least you can do as a guest is to honour their requests for a minimum level of demeanour. It is out of respect for your host that your second consideration arises. So it is always safer to slip up on the conservative side and to be overdressed than underdressed.
Use your best judgement. The goal of business casual is not to draw attention to yourself with your dress. You want to present yourself in a clean, respectable, professional and mature manner. This is not to discourage self-expression through dress, but business casual isnt exactly the platform for making personal style declarations.
All business attire, whether traditional or casual, should be reflective of a professional, dignified appearance. One should remember that it always helps to look your best, because people like to have good looking people around them. Why Because it makes them feel good looking too.

The workshop was inaugurated by Lanka IOC Managing Director Shyam Bohra. In his keynote address Bohra stressed the need for constant upgrading of knowledge through such interactions with top management institutes. He said that knowledge upgrading was equally important for the company's dealers as it was for its executives since dealers are the real face of the company.

Legal action against those with dual citizenship: Gammanpila
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila said he means to take legal action against those parliamentarians with dual citizenships, on the basis they had provided false information to the Election Commission.
His announcement comes in the wake of a RTI request filed with the Department of Immigration and Emigration seeking information on the number of those enjoying the privileges of dual citizenship, while functioning as parliamentarians.
On May 3, the Court of Appeal ruled that United Peoples Freedom Alliance Galle district MP Geetha Kumarasinghe was disqualified from holding seat in parliament, on account of holding dual citizenship in Sri Lanka and Switzerland.
Kumarasinghe has filed an appeal at the Supreme Court seeking to set aside the order made by the Court of Appeal, which removes her from her seat at Galle district MP. Piyasena Gamage is set to replace Geetha as Galle district UPFA MP.
However, the Election Commission has decided to wait until the Supreme Court makes a judgment on the appeal filed by Kumarasinghe, before appointing anyone to the seat left vacant.

Lions Club Sinhabhisheka convention on May 20
The Lions worldwide are celebrating the Centenary of Lionism which was introduced in Chicago, Illinois, USA by founder Melvin Jones, an insurance agent, who relinquished his business to engage full time in serving the less fortunate.
He would not have dreamt that the Lions Clubs International would march ahead for the 100th year while Lions in Sri Lanka celebrate the 60th year of Lionism that was brought in 1957 through India.
The Lions Clubs International District 306A2, spanning from Colombo to the District of Moneragala with 90 Lions Clubs and over 2,000 Lions will be celebrating its 12th Annual District convention called Sinhabhisheka on May 20 and 21 in a grand manner at the Golden Rose Banquet Hall, Boralesgamuwa under the direction of District Governor 2016/2017, Lion Dr. Athula Hikkaduwa.

At the beginning of the Lionistic Year 2016/2017, DG Lion Dr. Athula Hikkaduwa, introduced a Five Point Programme under his theme, Dedicated for Humanity, covering the areas of (a) Service  To Build a Healthy Community, (b) Administration and Membership Development to Strengthen the Movement, Building to Encourage Service Minded People to Serve the Community, (d) Leadership and Youth Development to Prepare them for the Future and (e) Centennial Service Challenge to make a difference in the Community.
His novel concept was Siha Sevana, a Legacy Programme and District Governor challenged the Lions Clubs to build homes for deserving families as he hoped that clubs will honor his challenge by constructing at least 25 houses during his term of leadership. His dream has been exceeded by several clubs by constructing over 25 houses and hopefully, by the end of June 30, nearly 30 to 35 houses will be completed for occupation by those deserving families selected by the respective clubs.

Makers markers
Toward the north end of Chicagos Graceland Cemetery, around Lake Willowmere, lies a cluster of graves belonging to the citys most famous architects, among them Louis Sullivan, Daniel Burnham, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Fazlur Khan. Henry Kuehn discovered this so-called cemetery of architects while serving as director of the Graceland Cemetery tour, and it sparked a quest to research and catalogue architects gravesites all around the country. At the heart of his pursuit was a desire to understand how these monument builders are remembered in death. The results, recorded in Kuehns new book, Architects Gravesites: A Serendipitous Guide, are as varied as the built structures those men and women left behind. Below is a selection, together with an excerpt from Paul Goldbergers afterword. Nicole Rudick
To come to the end of this book is to conclude a journey across the United States, across architectural history, and into human character. I am not sure that the final resting places of celebrated and accomplished architects tell us all that much about their workafter all, few of them designed their own burial sites or grave markers, and the graves that most closely resemble the architecture of their occupants were quite often designed by others, sometimes many years later, and some have the forced quality of all-too-earnest homage. But if the design of architects gravesites sheds only minimal light on their work, their graves do tell us rather more than we might have expected about these architects as people. Some of them are grand and imposing, others so modest as to be no more than small stone plaques set flat upon the ground. Many architects chose to be buried with their families, and their grave markers confer equal billing to spouses and sometimes other family members.
Of course, what most of us wantwhat most of us turn the pages of Architects Gravesites hoping to findis some kind of echo of the architects voice, however many of the architects themselves shied away from expressing it. Clearly the instinct toward modesty arises more often for architects in death than it does in life, since it is hard not to be surprised at how many of these final resting places are small and understated. A successful architect, after all, need not fear that he or she leaves nothing behind: the smallest building is usually larger than the most elaborate grave, and most of these architects have left plenty of buildings, most of which are not at all small, for us to remember them by.
Paul Goldberger
After apprenticing with other architects, Bethune and her husband opened an architectural office in 1881. By so doing, she is credited with being the countrys first professional woman architect. Despite her importance, she is buried next to her husband beneath a headstone bearing only his name. Acknowledging this oversight, the local chapter of the American Institute of Architects arranged for the installation of a nearby plaque that proclaims her accomplishments and significance.
Part of the Bauhaus movement in Germany, Breuer immigrated to the United States and maintained an ongoing relationship with Walter Gropius. He established what became a significant architectural practice, designing residences, churches, schools, and office buildings.
Breuers cremated remains are buried beneath a boulder on the property of the residence he designed for himself. The markings on the stone are hard to decipher but apparently were chosen by the self-deprecating Breuer to say, Here lies Breuer who broke his knee entirely of his own stupidity.
Cram is known for the many churches and university campuses that he designed. Among his credits are the campuses of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, Princeton University, and Rice University.
His gravesite is one of the loveliest of all that were visited. A walk along a path through tall pine trees leads one to a small, rustic chapel designed by Cram. Cram had purchased several acres of this land, along with an old farmhouse, which he and his family used as a summer retreat. He ultimately built this simple stone chapel with the help of family members and local stonemasons. He described it as perhaps the most satisfactory church I have ever built. The chapel and land were deeded to a local church with the condition that his grave could be placed next to the chapel. Thus, off to the side of this rustic chapel are two blue slate headstones and footstones facing the chapels entrance that note the graves of Cram and his wife.
It is noteworthy that Cram is one of the few architects who put such care and thought into the marker and site where his remains would be placed.

Man City bolster top-four hopes, Arsenal close in on Liverpool
LONDON, Saturday - Manchester City enjoyed a huge let-off in their quest for a top-four finish in the Premier League while Arsenal edged to within a point of fourth-placed Liverpool with an impressive victory on Saturday.
A freakish penalty miss by Leicester City's Riyad Mahrez at the Etihad Stadium allowed Manchester City to squeeze out a 2-1 victory that lifted them to third place, above Liverpool. Mahrez beat Willy Caballero with 13 minutes remaining but had slipped in his run-up and inadvertently struck the ball twice, once with each foot. Eagle-eyed referee Robert Madley correctly applied the law and City breathed deeply before seeing out the remainder of the game to stay on course for Champions League qualification.
When I saw the reaction from Willy, I understood immediately that it was two touches, City manager Pep Guardiola, whose side finish with matches against West Bromwich Albion and Watford, told reporters.
The referee was so brave in making the decision. I've seen that happen before, a long time ago! It's not normal to see something like that, but it is what it is.
With Chelsea having wrapped up the title on Friday and Sunderland and Middlesbrough already relegated, the final flurry of matches will decide which two clubs join the champions Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League and who becomes the third side to slide through the trapdoor.
Arsenal maintained their late challenge with a classy 4-1 victory at Stoke City to keep the pressure on Liverpool who now sit just one point above the in-from Gunners. Olivier Giroud's brace and goals from the brilliant duo of Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil sealed an emphatic victory for Arsenal who have won five of their past six games to jump right back into contention.
