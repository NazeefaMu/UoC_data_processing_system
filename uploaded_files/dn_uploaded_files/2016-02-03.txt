Bhikkhu Kathikawath Bill: Mahanayaka Theras' word is final - Gayantha
The Theravada Bhikkhu Kathikawath Bill that will give legal authority to Adhikarana Sangha Councils to conduct its disciplinary measures on members of the clergy regarding their moral conduct including violations of the monastic code, has entered its final stages, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka yesterday told the Daily News.
He said the Draft Bill would be presented to Parliament in stages only after the government receives written approval from the Mahanayake Theras of the Malwatte, Ramanna, Asgiriya and Amarapura Nikayas.
"The Mahanayaka Theras have advised and recommended that the Bill be made law soon," said Minister Karunathilaka and added, "Minister of Buddha Sasana and Justice is working on it."
He said, " I moved the the Bill in Parliament as the Chief Government Whip."
"The Bill having been presented in Parliament, was later withdrawn and referred back for necessary amendments to be made by the Mahanayake Theras. This was in keeping with a decision arrived at by the the Cabinet, President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, that the Bill shall be brought to Parliament in stages with written approval from the Mahanayake Theras," the minister said.
Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs Chandraprema Gamage said on being asked whether the Mahanayake Theras have given their written consent to the Bill, that the Mahanayake Theras of Malwatte and Ramanna Chapters have informed them in writing that that the bill is suitable for registration. Asked if the Mahanayake Theras had proposed some amendments, Gamage said ,"Yes. We worked with them and include them in the draft," he added.

DIMO partners SLARDAR to bring Jeep Rally Cship 2016
Bringing to light a significant sporting feat in the form of the Jeep Wrangler TSD Rally Championship 2016 to Sri Lankas motor sports calendar, the Sri Lanka Association of Racing Driver and Riders (SLARDAR) and Colombo Motor Sports Club (CMSC) are set to initiate the countrys first ever rough terrain rally which will bring on board skilled drivers from around the country to take part in this mega sporting spectacle. SLARDAR have proudly joined hands with DIMO as the title sponsors for the entire event.
The championship, which has been described as a set of three night rallies, have been scheduled to take place based on the following segments: SALRDAR 1000 which will cover approximately 1000 kms form the 19 to the 21 of February, the first leg of the Colombo Rally Challenge which will cover approximately 400 kms and set to take place on June 18 and 19 and the second leg of the Colombo Rally Challenge covering a distance of 400 kms as well and has been set to take place on October 08 and 09 this year.
SLARDAR President, Nishan Wasalathanthri commented, These Rallies are amongst the toughest and most grueling motoring events to ever take place in Sri Lanka and this event will witness a coverage of around 1800 kms over an expanse of taxing roads and trails that would encompass passing through the misty hill country, elephant infested jungles and fast gravel roads setting for the drivers a test of an event to be involved in where both, man and machine would experience the ultimate testing ground in those forms.
Freedom and power embedded with adventure and capability is the core of Jeep life which allows hardcore Jeep enthusiasts to explore and go beyond the capabilities of the all American legend. Mentioning about Jeep and DIMO sponsoring the event, Ranjith Pandithage (Chaman-DIMO) Jeep is proud to partner SLARDAR in the first ever Jeep Rally Championship 2016. We believe this grueling event brings out the core values of Jeep and the passion behind off-road driving where man and the machine both will be tested.
The reliability and the skills of the driver combined with the machines resolution as well as the navigators sense of direction are quintessential in achieving the top spot in the championship. The decisive moment when the winner would be announced would place the champion on the crest of national recognition and for the first time in Sri Lanka, gaining the stature as champion of the TSD Rally Championship will be the ultimate recognition a rally driver, navigator as well as a team could ever achieve in the face of serious rallying. The championship will also act as a testing ground for the strong willed, physically and mentally conditioned participants.
The JEEP-WRANGLER - SLARDAR 1000 Rally is scheduled to flag off from the DIMO 800 showroom and the first car to be flagged off will be at 7.02 pm. They will run approximately 4  hrs and will have a 1  hour break in Kurunegala. From Kurunegala, they will run for 5 hours and finish in Kandy at approximately 6.00 am.
The third stage will commence from Kandy at the KCC car park at 4.00 pm and will run for 4  hours and finish in Kandy once again. The competitors will have a 2 hour break in Kandy and will commence the fourth stage to Ratnapura or Avissawella and will run for another 4  hours.
The fifth and the last stage will start in either Avissawella or Ratnapura and finish at the DIMO 800 showroom by 7.00 a.m. on February 21. The SLARDAR 1000 awards ceremony will commence from 11.00 am at the premises. The championship awards ceremony will be held along with the Sri Lanka Super Series awards night at the Eagles Lake Side in Ratmalana on November 26.

Dont expect quick fixes cautions head coach Graham Ford
South African-born Graham Ford told the Sri Lankan media not to expect any quick fixes with regard to performances as he undertook his new assignment as head coach of the Sri Lankan cricket team.
Sri Lanka is in the early part of a rebuilding phase so dont expect any quick fixes, Ford said addressing a media conference at SLC headquarters to announce his appointment.
I am very aware what a huge challenge it is. Sri Lanka finds itself in the very early stages of an important team rebuilding process, a lot of hard work needs to be done so its very important that this team building is done on a very solid foundation so patience is required, said Ford who has returned as coach of the national team for a second time. His first stint was from 2012-14.
I know there is an abundance of talent within the system but it is about identifying those who have got the mental toughness to go on and become consistent players and become match winners at international level.
Its quite a long process which is required to be put in place, a lot of hard work and certainly not just for me but all involved particularly Jerome (Jayaratne) who has been involved in Sri Lanka cricket for a long time and knows the players so well and the wealth of knowledge technically and tactically. Its important his input and also the selectors and the Board all working together to ensure the long term process can take place so that we can take Sri Lanka back to top of the international stage, he said.
Jayaratne who is the head of coaching at Sri Lanka Cricket is expected to be appointed assistant coach to Ford as well as take on the role of manager of the Sri Lanka team, a position previously held by Jerry Woutersz.
The current team is going through a period of transition following the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara and team performances have sunk to the level that Sri Lanka lost its top ranking in T20 cricket which they had held since 2014, slipped to seventh slot in the Test rankings and lie fifth in the ODIs. It is a far cry from where they were when Ford left them in 2014 after a two-year stint.
It is a rebuilding phase that everybody has to go through from time to time. It is about bringing in the younger cricketers and working hard to give them the confidence to perform consistently at international level. That can take some time, you cant put a time frame on it, said Ford.
Hope things happen pretty quickly it depends on the work ethic and the attitude of the players. Improvement can happen very quickly but it requires patience from coaches, selectors, board members etc.
At times young players do make mistakes when they take a step up to international cricket. You take a couple of steps forward and then the odd step back. As long as they are making progress it doesnt matter. There is enough exciting stuff going on in Sri Lankan cricket to make sure the team improves on those rankings, he said.
Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala revealed that Ford was one of 12 coaches interviewed by him and vice presidents Jayantha Dharmadasa and K Mathivanan.
We have secured the services of one of the best coaches in the world. Ford is a coach who can transform our game into a different level to become the best team in the world in all three formats, said Sumathipala.
We have appointed Ford for 45 months so that he covers the 2019 World Cup in England where he has firsthand knowledge of the conditions there having coached the counties. We believe that we can win the 2019 World Cup in England with Fords help, he said.
Sumathipala also thanked former Sri Lanka cricketing great Kumar Sangakkara for playing a pivotal role in the release of Ford from English county Surrey where he has been coaching. Sangakkara completed one season of county cricket with Surrey last year with Ford as coach and the county fared well to earn promotion from division II to the Premier league.
We are happy that Graham has agreed to work with us. One of the key reasons for it is he believes that there is stability in Sri Lanka Cricket theres a way forward thinking and a professional approach to cricket. The arrival of Graham is going to boost our entire campaign to secure the Asia Cup and World T20 Cup, Sumathipala said.
I am extremely honoured that Sri Lanka Cricket should show confidence in my ability as a coach, said Ford. I cant tell you how excited I am to be back and involved with the Sri Lankan lads. Everybody knows and Ive said it many times how much I enjoyed my first two years with the Sri Lankan team. I really believe the players have such passion and good cricketing attitude.

The emergence of alternate political force cannot be prevented if the SLFP leadership doesn't win over the confidence of the party's grassroots, District UPFA Parliamentarian Keheliya Rambukwella said.
Rambukwella said a large section of the SLFP grassroots supporters have lost confidence in the party leadership. He said not paying heed to the voice of the lower level membership would have disastrous results on the party.
A vast majority of the grassroots membership believed the party could not be carried forward to victory without President Mahinda Rajapaksa's support, he said, and therefore an urgent solution should be found to the problem, before the forthcoming local government election.

Gammanpila has contract with UNP to divide SLFP - Minister
We will never allow anyone to divide the SLFP. Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila has undertaken a contract with the UNP to divide the SLFP, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
He said Gammanpila has recently stated in a radio interview that the SLFP should be divided with the aim of defeating the UNP. But, I must say to him that if the SLFP is divided, the UNP will win," Minister de Silva added.
The minister was addressing the media at the Information Department yesterday.
"The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will assist in the process of drafting a new Constitution as there is no mismatching with the process," the minister said.
"The SLFP received positive feedback from the United National Party(UNP) in connection with drafting of the new Constitution. Under this, nine proposals forwarded by the SLFP were accepted by the UNP," he said.
"Accordingly, the SLFP will assist in the formation of the basic structure for Constitutional Reforms and appointment of the Constitutional Committee," he said.
He added that people should not panic in this regard as the new Constitution has not been prepared yet. "But, certain persons in the opposition are trying to arouse people by leveling baseless allegations that the new Constitution creates severe issues on various sectors, including the country's unitary status or the priority accorded to Buddhism. The people, who level those baseless allegations, are trying to make political gain.It is clear that certain persons want to divide the SLFP for achieving their political objectives.
Minister de Silvapraised President Maithripala Sirisena for the measures taken to protect the SLFP.
However, he added that there are two opinions in the party. Speaking on the FCID, Minister de Silva said that the SLFP is against the FCID since its establishment is against the general practice of the country. "Therefore, the FCID should be dissolved," he said.
But it doesnt mean that the investigations should be discontinued. Investigations should be carried out as usual through other established institutions such as the CID, Police and other such bodies he said.
Speaking on the arrest of Yoshitha Rajapaksa, he said that the SLFP has no argument with the conducting of probes in to financial malpractices. But, those investigations should be balanced and should not have double standards.
The minister added that a new Attorney General will be appointed soon which would further strengthen the judicial system.
However, we are against the appointment of an outsider to the post of Attorney General. Moreover there should not be any disputes between the Police and the judiciary system, he said.
Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said the United Nations Human Rights High Commissioner will visit the country on Saturday 6.
When the minister was asked whether the issue of the country will be taken up at the Geneva General Session in March, he said that probably the progress of protecting human rights in the country will be considered in March.
Minister Samarasinghe added there was much foreign mediation during the regime of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
During the regime of Rajapaksa, a former Attorney General of India and 12 other members visited the country together with Darusman, who prepared the much talked about Darusman report.
Besides, two foreign judges came to the country to assist the Paranagama Commission during the Rajapaksa period.
A team from the Scotland Yard Police also visited the country to conduct investigations into the Raviraj assassination, he said. "However, the minister added that there is nothing wrong in obtaining the assistance of foreign experts. The latest technology and methodologies are available with certain foreign experts and therefore the assistance of such experts can be obtained to the country as technical assistance," he said.
Reginald Cooray said that only the President can win the hearts of minorities. The SLFP did not receive the votes of minority communities. Only President Sirisena can obtain the minority votes, he said.

Iowa tie slows Clintons march toward nomination
US: Hillary Clintons vow to never again lose the Iowa caucuses, as she did in spectacular fashion in 2008, was paying off in a near-dead-even tie. But for Mrs Clinton, thats probably going to be enough.
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders strong showing almost certainly denies Mrs Clinton a glide path to the nomination and prolongs the contest deeper into the calendar than Mrs Clinton hoped, by likely giving her opponent an infusion of cash and momentum.
Its also sure to resurrect the questions that have long surrounded Mrs Clinton and nagged at Democrats, about why she cant close the deal, why many voters remain cool to her and whether she truly is capable of knocking out a Republican in the fall.
In the caucus, 22 delegates sided for Mrs Clinton and 21 for Mr Sanders, but the Clinton campaign said it expected one outstanding delegate to go with her as well. Despite it all, Mrs Clintons campaign was designed to withstand a bad night in Iowa, and a loss in next weeks New Hampshire primary, where Mr Sanders leads in the polls. She has the money, the state-by-state organisations and a spate of Clinton- friendly contests coming up that still give her the inside track on the Democratic nomination.
I think its important to take the long view. Unless numbers change dramatically in South Carolina and Nevada and more importantly the states in Super Tuesday, it will be difficult for Senator Sanders to win the nomination, said Mitch Stewart, a Democratic strategist and Clinton supporter who was President Barak Obamas Iowa field director in 2008 and battleground states director in 2012.
David Axelrod, a former adviser to Mr Obama who directs the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago, called it a good night for Bernie.
A tie when youre duelling with the champion is a win, even though the terrain was more hospitable to Sanders, and the diverse states beyond New Hampshire will be far more challenging for him, Mr Axelrod said. Shes still the favourite, but he will raise big money off of tonights showing, which could, at a minimum, prolong the race.
Sanders, a Democratic socialist without the youth or biracial appeal of Barack Obama, nevertheless tapped into Mr Obamas voters and this years angry, anti-establishment wave. He rode a wave of young voter turnout after his campaign worked hard to organize voters on college campuses across the state.
Sanders said when he began his campaign in Iowa nine months ago, We had no money. We had no name recognition and we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the United States of America.
Sanders said Iowans are sending a profound message: It is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
In a speech to supporters, Mrs Clinton never outright declared victory but said she was breathing a big sigh of relief following the caucuses. Rather than dwell on the results, however, she focused her remarks on her argument that she is the candidate best suited to take on the opposing party in the general election.
We may have differences of opinion about how best to achieve our goals but I believe we have a very clear idea that the Democratic party and this campaign stands for what is best in America. And we have to be united when it is all said and done against Republicans, Mrs Clinton said.
Later in the night Mrs Clintons press secretary Brian Fallon circled back to the question of which candidate could claim victory in Iowa.
We believe strongly that we won tonight, Mr Fallon told reporters aboard a press plane preparing to depart Des Moines for New Hampshire. He said Mrs Clinton had proven her ability to organise and turn out voters. With 22 delegates going to Mrs Clinton and 21 to Mr Sanders, Mr Fallon said the campaign expected one outstanding delegate to go to Mrs Clinton as well.

Malala seeks to raise $1.4 billion to educate Syrian refugees
UK: Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai will seek to inspire world leaders at a conference in London on Thursday to commit $1.4 billion this year to give Syrian refugee children access to education.
Heads of state and government and ministers from countries around the world will converge on London for the Supporting Syria and the region conference, which aims to raise funds for humanitarian crises caused by the Syrian war.
Some 700,000 Syrian children living in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon and in other Middle Eastern countries are out of school, according to a report issued by the Malala Fund, which campaigns and fundraises for educational causes.
I have met so many Syrian refugee children, they are still in my mind. I can't forget them. The thought that they won't be able to go to school in their whole life is completely shocking and I cannot accept it, Malala said in a telephone interview.
We can still help them, we can still protect them. They are not lost yet.
They need schools. They need books. They need teachers.
This is the way we can protect the future of Syria.
A Pakistani teenage education activist who came to prominence when a Taliban gunman shot her in the head on her school bus in 2012, Malala continued campaigning on the world stage and in 2014 became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner. Now 18, she lives in Britain but devotes much of her time and energy to the cause of education for Syrian refugee children. An accomplished public speaker who brought a United Nations audience to its feet in a celebrated speech in 2013, she hopes to make a powerful impact at the London event.
I'm hoping to encourage and inspire world leaders to take action. I'm not going to wait. We can't wait. It needs to happen.
She will appear at the London conference alongside 17-year-old schoolgirl Muzoon Almellehan, who will be the only young Syrian refugee to address world leaders at the event.
Without education we cannot do anything, Muzoon said on the same call as Malala.
She said she was working hard on improving her English so she could complete her schooling in Britain and go to university, but also wanted to dedicate herself with my sister Malala to the cause of education for fellow Syrian refugees.
The pair first met in 2014 at the sprawling Zaatari refugee camp in the Jordanian desert, and were reunited in December last year when Muzoon was resettled in northern England.
She is the one that I want people to listen to.
Her story is so powerful, it's so inspiring. She's going to tell world leaders that these children have a right to an education and they must not ignore it, said Malala.
Co-hosted by the United Nations and the governments of Britain, Germany, Norway and Kuwait, the London conference is not limited to education but aims to obtain pledges from countries to meet a range of Syrian humanitarian needs.
UN agencies are appealing for a total of $7.73 billion to cope with Syria's needs this year and an additional $1.2 billion are required by regional governments for their own plans to deal with the impact of Syria's conflict.
In previous years, donor funding has fallen short of UN appeals.

Malinga appointed captain till World T20
Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday appointed fast bowler Lasith Malinga as captain of the national Twenty20 team till the end of the ICC World T20 in India in April.
Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala said that Malinga has been appointed captain for the bilateral T20 series in India and the Asia Cup in Bangladesh both this month and the World T20 in India in March.
"Angelo Mathews will be the vice-captain and Dinesh Chandimal will be his deputy," said Sumathipala.
"These three people have been given the responsibility to work as brothers and build the national team.
They have a colossal amount of experience and knowledge and ability to build the team," said Sumathipala.
"At the end of the day they have to go to the middle and perform and carry the Sri Lankan flag that is their responsibility. If they don't go as one united single family it is very difficult to perform. We believe the three of them are working tirelessly towards that goal.
"We spoke to the Sports Minister and took a decision that we want to secure the position of national captain for the three T20 series and decided to appoint Malinga for all three," he said.
It was under Malinga's captaincy that Sri Lanka won the World T20 title against India in the final played at Dhaka in 2014.

MR attempting to use son's arrest for political gain - Harin
Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando yesterday said when one observed the reaction of Rohitha Rajapaksa on the arrest of Yoshitha Rajapaksa, this was proof of their aggressive behaviour while in power.
He was addressing a press conference at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday. Replying to the social media post by Rohitha Rajapaksa, "Dear Yahapalanaya, you just stood on the tail of the lion, now don't expect the lion, not to rip u in to parts,"the minister said, "This challenge comes at a time when they were left out of power. Can you imagine what would have happened in the country if this had happened when they were in power".
He further criticized the way former President Mahinda Rajapaksa attempted to use the arrest of his son Yoshitha for political gain, stating that this kind of behaviour exhibits his (Mahinda Rajapaksa's) political bankruptcy.
"Why did 6.2 million people vote for President Maithripala Sirisena on January 8 and why did all civil society organizations come together at that election All of them fought against the law of the jungle and dictatorship. We have no hatred towards anybody and we did not serve milk rice on streets when he was arrested," he said.
"We are accomplishing a duty of the Government. This is public money. We need to find out how these black money came into the country. This is a good lesson for all, including those in the present Government. The arrest came after persistent investigations since March 20, 2015.

Defending champion K.H. Sirisoma of Sri Lanka Ports Authority retained the National Billiards Championship when he overcame S.H.M. Aslam of Moors SC by six frames to one in the final played at the Billiards and Snooker Association headquarters table at Sugathadasa Sports Hotel yesterday.
Sirisoma won the title for a record 24th time in a career spanning over three decades since he took to the cue game.

Aslam had the consolation of winning the fifth frame but Sirisoma sealed the game with convincing victories in the sixth and seventh frames to create a new billiard record.
Result (Final): K.H. Sirisoma (SLPA) beat S.H.M. Aslam (MSC) 6-1 (100/91, 100/51, 102/96, 103/88, 70/100, 100/85, 101/83)

Sri Lanka picks strong women's hockey team
Sri Lanka has selected a strong squad to represent the women's hockey for the South Asian Games women's hockey championship to be held in Guwahati, India this month.
The team will leave this week and in the initial rounds will play two matches before moving into the knock out stage. This is the first time that a women's hockey championship will be conducted in the South Asian Games for women's hockey. Thus this is going to be a historic of a sort for the women stickers.
The hockey coach of the women's team G G Dharmaratne said that the team is strong in all departments and they have been put through their paces at the Sports Ministry Astro turf in Colombo under the overall instructions of the consultant coach from Pakistan Mohammed Akhlaq.
Coach Dharmaratne said that Sri Lanka women stickers have a good chance of winning a medal at this inaugural championship for women. Our main challengers will be India and Pakistan and if we can overcome one of them then we can be assured of a silver medal and can have a go at the gold medal.
The squad stated below has been approved by the Minister of Sports and the captain has been not appointed up to Tuesday morning.
Making up the squad are three school girls namely Sandaruwani Jayaratne (Sangamitta BV, Matale), Sakuntala Illeperuma (Seetha Devi BV, Kandy) and Mawanjana Ekanayake (Sangamitta BV, Matale). It must be recalled centre half Nawanjana Ekanayake and centre forward Sandaruwani Jayaratne played a crucial role in Sangamittha Balika Vidyalaya winning the National School Games Girls Hockey Championship in 2015. Both are very promising players and Sandaruwani Jayaratne in particular is an energetic forward who could tear into the opponents defence. Sakuntala Illeperuma is the understudy custodian to the experienced JEewanthika Keerthiratne of Sri Lanka Navy. Illeperuma it appears has been preferred to the experience of Nirmani de Silva. Other stickers who could not make this tours are experienced Dharshani Herath, Vajira Rajapakse, Anandi Rajapakse, Sandhya Dayananda and Manisha Dissanayake. These five players have made several tours with the national team including the World League championship and the Asian Championship.
In the squad are two former captains in Chathurika Wijesuriya and Madhushani Jayanetti both from Sri Lanka Navy. It is a matter for conjecture whether either of them will get the captaincy job or a third player will wear the mantle. Among the other contenders are Madura Dharmaratne, Buddhika Gunaratne.
The touring party as approved by the Ministry of Sports: Geethani Abeyratnem Yamuna Wijesuriya, Jeewanthi Keerthiratne (goal keeper), Buddhika Gunaratne, Pradeepa Nilmini, Harshani Wickremasinghe, H Y Shanika Prathana Upeksha, Geethika Damayanthi, Nawanjana Ekanayake, Sandaruwani 'Chocolate' Jayaratne, Sakuntala Illeperuma (goal keeper), W M I D Weerabahu, Chathurika Wijesuriya, Madhushani Jayanetti, K A C T Themiyadasa, P A C D Premasiri. Officials: Coach G G Dharmaratne, Assistant Coach H M P C Lanerolle, Manageress Ms Sunethra Ruapsinghe, T A D Gamage (Physio)

Test and one-day cricket - SLC must strike a fine balance
In this age where money rules over everything and can be a distraction Sri Lanka Cricket as a responsible controlling body for cricket in this country must closely monitor the progress of its cricketers especially the young ones who have broken into the international circuit.
Sri Lanka Cricket must clearly look at which way it wants the cricket to go whether the shortest form of the game Twenty20 cricket is more important than Test cricket.
Sad to say that Sri Lanka despite having fought so hard to obtain Test status are today nowhere near to being a force in Test cricket. To be more frank they never were in their 34 years of their chequered Test career.
We may have produced great batsmen and bowlers in Test matches but never a team that continued to dominate Test cricket the way Australia, West Indies, England, South Africa and India have.
There was a time when Muthiah Muralitharan and Chaminda Vaas were in their prime that Sri Lanka proved unbeatable at home but even that assurance has diminished over the years so that visiting sides of the recent past have found no difficulty in coming to Sri Lanka and winning a Test series.
To win a Test match it is not only the batsmens job to put runs on the board but there has to be bowlers who can get you 20 wickets. It is in this area where Sri Lanka has struggled since Muralitharan and Vaas left the international scene.
Where the SLC have failed is to strike a balance between Test cricket and one-day cricket (ie 50 overs and 20 overs). In the need and greed for greater financial gains they have foregone Test matches for one-day cricket and the result of taking such imprudent decisions is reflected in our current Test rankings where Sri Lanka are lying a lowly seventh ahead of only West Indies, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.
Since the ICC rankings came into being in 2003 or even before that we have never achieved top one-two position and we never will unless we change our attitude towards Test cricket. The longer format hardly attracts the spectators in this part of the world as 50-over and 20-over cricket. That is quite understandable because it is only in the two shortest formats that we have emerged world champions  1996 in 50 overs and 2014 in 20 overs.
Succeeding cricket administrators over the years have failed to see Test cricket as a money-spinner and opted more for the two shorter versions which has had a detrimental effect on our image as a Test nation. Even the spectators are geared towards coming to watch a T20 or fifty-over international than spend five days at a Test match. It seems that Sri Lanka does not have a Test cricket culture but one that is more heavily weighted towards the shorter formats, which is a sad reflection when one finds how competitively Test matches are played in countries like England, Australia, South Africa and quite recently in New Zealand. These countries too have T20 and fifty over cricket in their domestic and international structure but they have struck a fine balance between them and Test cricket so that the latter gets top priority over the other two. Sadly that is lacking in Sri Lanka for things have worked out in the reverse.
After quite a while we have unearthed two good bowlers who could win Test matches for us in the future  Dushmantha Chameera and Jeffrey Vandersay but what are they doing playing in the T20 format Exposing them to this type of cricket at this young age is only going to destroy their careers as future Test cricketers. These bowlers should be nurtured and retained to play only Test and possibly fifty-over cricket not exposed into the negativity of bowling in T20 cricket and their young minds poisoned with earning fast megabucks.
The national selectors look at it from a different perspective altogether. They are of the view that present day generation cricketers need to adapt to the current formats of cricket and that 16 cricketers from Sri Lanka having been listed for the upcoming 2016 IPL auction is proof that their talents and performances have been recognized internationally. They also bemoan the fact that they have only limited resources to select national teams from and thus, they have no other option but to select certain players to play in all three formats.
This is where the SLC has to step in and decide who should be and who should not be playing in the IPL or T20 cricket. Constant exposure to cricket has left Sri Lanka with an incoherent bowling attack or batting line up when the more important Test matches are played. As a result the performances suffer as Sri Lanka are not at full strength and it has been happening with alarming regularity. Without the exposure of IPL cricket Sri Lankan bowlers are still finding it hard to keep themselves injury free to play a full series of Test matches.
These are important points for the newly elected SLC committee to deeply ponder and make constructive decisions so that Test cricket stays vibrant and alive in this country and not follow the path that West Indies cricket has taken.
