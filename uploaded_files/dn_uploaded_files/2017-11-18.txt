Pentagon steps up Somalia drone strikes
US: The US military has quietly upped the tempo of its operations in Somalia, conducting a growing number of drone strikes against Al-Qaeda affiliated Shabaab militants and other Jihadists.
Since the start of the year, America has carried out 28 drone strikes in the Horn of Africa nation, with 15 of these coming since September 1, the military's Africa Command (AFRICOM) said.
That's a big increase from last year. According to the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which maintains a tally of US operations in Somalia and elsewhere, there were 15 anti-Shabaab air strikes in the whole of 2016.
The surge in activity comes as the US watches for an influx of fighters from the Islamic State group, which has lost almost all its territory in Iraq and Syria.
The US conducted a pair of drone strikes against IS in Somalia on November 3, the first time it has hit the jihadists there.
Though the Pentagon has provided few details about the strikes, spokesman Colonel Rob Manning said this week that US forces had killed 40 Shabaab and IS fighters in a series of five strikes on Somalia between November 9 and 12.
On Wednesday, AFRICOM announced a sixth strike that killed several Shabaab militants 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of the capital, Mogadishu.
The surge in activity comes after President Donald Trump in March loosened constraints on the US military in Somalia, allowing commanders to take action against suspected terrorists when they judge it is needed, without seeking specific White House approval.
The US is supporting the country's fight against Shabaab, which has carried out a string of devastating bombings in Mogadishu and elsewhere.
In May, officials said only about 50 US troops were in Somalia providing training and advice for the Somali military and logistical support, but on Thursday the Pentagon said the figure is now at about 500.
Pentagon spokesman and Joint Staff Director Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie told reporters Thursday that he didn't necessarily think there was a ramping-up of operations, but said the density of targets meant more strikes had been possible.
There's no particular rhythm to it, except that as (targets) become available and as we're able to process them and vet them, we strike, he said. McKenzie added that officials keep a close eye on foreign fighters' movements from Iraq and Syria, but he would not say if the Pentagon was tracking Jihadists flowing from their former caliphate through Yemen and onto Somalia.
Aside from US forces training and advising Somalia's young military, about 22,000 African Union troops are helping secure outlying urban areas. AMISOM, the AU's mission in Somalia, has said it will withdraw 1,000 troops fighting jihadists in the country this year, as part of plans to pull out all soldiers by December 2020. Washington is worried the reduction will hamper efforts against Shabaab.
Deputy Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan met with Ugandan Minister of Defense Adolf Mwesige in Vancouver, Canada on the margins of a UN peacekeeping summit this week.
Uganda is the main contributor to AMISOM and has been there for a decade.
Shanahan acknowledged those Ugandan lives lost in Somalia. He expressed his understanding of the frustration with the pace of progress in Somalia but also his confidence that progress is being made, Shanahan's spokeswoman Commander Sarah Higgins said.
For Jennifer Cooke, an Africa specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, this militarization of US policy in Somalia is concerning.
The raining down of strikes from the sky can give major fuel to recruitment by (jihadist) groups, she told AFP. - AFP

Public servants should not pursue personal interests
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena yesterday said government servants in provincial administration should not think of their personal interests and work for the betterment of their areas.
He said public servants should devote their entire time and manpower to implement government policies to benefit the people.
We initiated major development activities and construction projects in 332 divisional secretariats within 25 districts, he said.
Every rupee we received from the central government is used to develop the region and uplift the public . We allocated Rs. 350 billion for all divisional secretaries to implement development projects, the Minister said.
He said the media highlighted only the shortcomings.
They do not give much publicity for out development projects all over the country, he said.

Pujara benefitting by county experience - Pothas
KOLKATA, Friday - The man carrying Indias hopes of a decent first innings total Cheteswar Pujara was praised for his determined and dogged resistance in trying conditions by Sri Lanka head coach Nic Pothas who attributed it to his experience of playing English county cricket.
Pujara he is a world class player. That innings shows the benefit of him playing county cricket. That is definitely a wicket you find in April and May and he played the conditions well, said Pothas at the end of another rain ruined second day of the first Test.
While all the Indian top order batsmen had struggled to come to terms with the overcast conditions and the grassy Eden Gardens pitch prepared for the match, Pujara alone stood tall mounting a one-man resistance against the marauding Lankan seaming attack headed by Suranga Lakmal.
After two days India has stumbled to 74-5 with Pujara making the major contribution to the total with an determined unbeaten 47 off 103 balls.
The game is not that old and we have only finished two days of play. Where we stand at the moment we are very happy but we are not getting too comfortable as it is a high quality Indian team, said Pothas.
So far we are pleased how things have gone for us. It will be very challenging batting conditions. You have got to still go out there and do the job.
Speaking on the Lankan seam attack Pothas said, The attack is different as these guys were mostly injured when we played India at home.
Secondly, they are seam bowler friendly conditions. Of course you can attribute the success to the conditions as thats the fact of matter. As I said, the conditions are provided and you need to play in them. Pujara has played really well.
Lakmal is a very intelligent bowler. He does lots of research. He knows how to control his workload.
He is very astute and knows when he is prepared. Thats the mark of any international bowler. He has improved immeasurably, said Pothas.
If you are playing international cricket, you have to always improve as others are improving. Otherwise you are not going to make any progress.

Pujara holds out as India struggle
Kolkata: Cheteshwar Pujara stood firm against a relentless Sri Lankan pace attack as India stumbled to 74-5 before rain cut short the second day of the first Test on Friday.
Fast bowler Dasun Shanaka struck twice on a cloudy morning session at Kolkata's Eden Gardens as the hosts struggled to improve on their overnight 17-3.
Pujara, batting on 47, and wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha, on six, were at the crease when rain halted play for the day before lunch.
Pujara's overnight partner Ajinkya Rahane became Shanaka's first victim, caught behind for four after a tentative 21-ball stay at the crease.
Shanaka, playing just his second Test after his debut against England last year, also got Ravichandran Ashwin for four, putting the hosts in trouble at 50-5.
Pujara, starting the day on eight, hit out when he could, finding the boundary nine times during his 102-ball stay so far.
Meanwhile Suranga Lakmal, who took three wickets in six maiden overs on Thursday, conceded his first runs after 46 balls to return figures of 3-5.
Lakmal's victims included India skipper Virat Kohli on day one, when adverse weather allowed only 11.5 overs to be played.
Twenty-one overs were bowled on the second day as the wet start to the three-Test series continued. - AFP

Retain Executive Presidency - Samarasinghe
The Executive Presidency should be retained for the countrys defence and to protect its unitary status, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
He also said that the powers of the governors who are representatives of the President should not be reduced too. The Northern Province Chief Minister has refused to hoist the National Flag at a ceremony at a school in the North, Minister Samarasinghe said.
That is wrong. We should not give all the powers to Parliament, because the heads in the House can be changed.
Minister Samarasinghe was speaking during the Committee Stage debate on the budget proposal for the fiscal year 2018, under 24 Financial Heads including the President, Prime Minister, Supreme Court Judges and Cabinet of Ministers which was taken up in Parliament yesterday.
The inflation rate cannot be reduced because we have given a salary increase. In the past, we gave a Rs 10,000 salary increase to the public, Minister Samarasinghe said.
President Maithripala Sirisena is the only President in the countrys history who dared to curtail his own powers, the Minister said.
He said that the President has neither betrayed the War Heroes nor has he allowed racism to spread.
Minister Samarasinghe added that some Opposition members charged that the President had attempted to conceal the Treasury Bond issue. He also added that finally they have been proved wrong. The Commission has been open to the media.
President Sirisena has instructed that the report be submitted before December 8, Minister Samarasinghe added.

Road carnage: Act now
The recent accident in Rajagiriya, which claimed the life of at least one school child and seriously injured several more, has once again focused our attention on the need to ensure road safety. It is easy to rattle off the statistic that seven persons are killed on average on our roads every day, but behind this number lies real people, real lives. Everyone who is killed or maimed on the road is someones mother, father, brother, sister, husband, wife, nephew, niece or friend. What is even more painful is the fact that most, if not all, accidents are preventable.
Road traffic accidents kill an estimated 1.25 million people worldwide each year and injure 50 million - 90 per cent of them in middle - and low-income countries, though the United States has the highest number of road fatalities. Such accidents are the leading cause of death among young people aged between 15 and 29. Almost half of all road traffic deaths are among pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists. Without sustained action, road traffic crashes are predicted to become the seventh leading cause of death by 2030.
Tomorrow (November 19), the world will remember these victims on the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. The Day has become an important tool in global efforts to reduce road casualties. It offers an opportunity for drawing attention to the scale of emotional and economic devastation caused by road crashes and for giving recognition to the suffering of road crash victims and the work of support and rescue services. The UN has also declared a Decade of Action for Road Safety from 2011 to 2020. Sri Lanka too must accordingly step up its efforts to reduce accidents.
The accident in Rajagiriya has brought several issues to the fore. Judging by available accounts, both cars had been driven by novice drivers with no long-term experience. And with experience comes wisdom. Young people love the thrill of speed, without necessarily thinking about its consequences. CCTV footage of the accident makes it very clear that both cars were speeding and careened out of control.
The biggest lesson that parents could learn from this unfortunate incident is that young people who had recently obtained the driving licence should not be allowed to drive unsupervised. In many other countries, young drivers have to display a P (for Probation) Plate for at least one year and be accompanied by a qualified adult driver in the passenger seat. If an accident occurs during this period, the licence is either revoked or the probation period extended, depending on its severity. It is also best to let them drive smaller vehicles first  unfortunately in Sri Lanka, one can get the licence today and drive a high-powered Ferrari tomorrow.
The key ingredient for driving success is discipline. This is one quality that most of our drivers lack across the board. Sri Lankans who have driven abroad know that even a horn sound is rare in many countries. Instead, our roads are a chaotic mess where everyone wants to get ahead at the expense of the other motorists and road users. A little courtesy and decency on the road will actually make everyone safer. Achieving discipline on the road should start from schools to catch them young. And road rules are applicable not only to motorists  pedestrians too must follow them. Even a minor gesture such as waiting till the green man comes on to cross a street will go a long way towards ensuring road safety.
It is too early to say whether the higher fines imposed recently on a series of offences could have an effect on road safety. But they should act as a deterrent, since Rs.25,000 is a lot of money for the average motorist. Enforcing self-discipline in fear of a higher fine is not an ideal scenario, but in the absence of another mechanism it is the best choice. Conversely, Police have also started a drive to reward good drivers, which will encourage drivers to be at their best behaviour on the road. The Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) with the fullest collaboration of the Police has started a successful programme titled Parissamen Gihin Enna (Drive Carefully) which is educating drivers islandwide. The SLRC must be commended for this initiative - we need more such awareness programmes on road discipline and safety.
While one cannot underestimate the human factor in accidents, todays vehicles are much safer and often save lives in a serious crash. This is why the Government deserves praise for banning the import/assembly of cars without SRS Airbags and ABS (Brakes) through Budget 2018. Many advanced cars have a raft of accident prevention measures from Lane Departure Warning to drowsiness monitoring, which will filter down to the lower-priced cars. Future trends such as driverless or autonomous cars could prevent road accidents altogether, as they will be able interact with other cars, road signs and instantly identify inanimate and animate objects. That day will surely come, but until then, saving lives on the road is very much in our hands.

Rugby soldier Semesa Rokoduguni dedicates England try to military
There were 81,683 rugby fans at Twickenham to watch England's victory over Argentina but, for a few moving minutes before kick-off, you couldn't hear any of them.
A lone bugler played the Last Post as the stadium fell silent to remember those who have lost their lives in conflict, including 27 England international players who were killed in World War I.
Prince Harry, who completed two tours of Afghanistan during his 10-year Army career, was in the stands to support England who wore red poppies on their shirts.
So it was fitting that a serving soldier, Lance Corporal Semesa Rokoduguni, scored the try that secured the 21-8 victory on what was otherwise a frustrating day for his team.
"To get over and score a try, on Remembrance Day, that means a lot," said Fiji-born Rokoduguni who is still attached to the British Army as a reconnaissance driver of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guard.
"I dedicate my try and the win to my regiment and the boys out there."
The pre-game tribute was particularly poignant for Rokoduguni who, just a week into a six-month 2011 tour of Afghanistan, witnessed a colleague lose both legs after stepping on an improvised explosive device.
"A couple of my mates out there have been through quite a hard time, even in the regiment. Some of the guys were casualties out there, so for me to be out there representing them made it an emotional day for me.
FAMILY TRADITION
Rokoduguni, 30, joined the Army as a 19-year-old in 2007, following a proud military tradition in his family that stretches from his great-great grandfather to his father, Ilaitia, who is a staff sergeant with the United Nations peacekeeping force.
After some eye-catching performances for the Army's rugby team, including a hat-trick against the Navy at Twickenham, young Rokoduguni was offered a professional contract by Bath in 2012 and, just two years later, made his England debut against Fiji, the country of his birth.
"It says on my contract that I'm a soldier first and a rugby player second," said Rokoduguni who, despite his busy rugby schedule, tries to spend as much time with the Army as possible.
"Before the season started I went up there [Scotland] for a couple of days because we used to deal with tanks, but now we've moved to Jackals so I had to get used to those new vehicles.
"I won't get up there again until the end of the season. I'll do a couple of courses and basically be a soldier again."
READY FOR ANY OPPORTUNITY
Rokoduguni was called back into the England squad this Autumn for the first time in 12 months thanks to an impressive run with Bath which saw him score seven tries in as many games.
He came on as a replacement for the concussed Mike Brown early in the match at Twickenham and his second-half try was one of very few highlights in an underwhelming performance by the world's second best side.
The Lance Corporal has now scored in each of his three international appearances and he hopes that he's done enough to retain his place for Saturday's game against Australia.
"All I can do now is focus on the things I can control; my performance on the training field so that I keep banging on the door," he said.
"I will review my stuff from [the Argentina game]; things I need to work on and improve, then train as hard as I can. I have to be ready for any opportunity that comes across."
'GRINDATHON'
It was England's 11th consecutive home victory but they struggled to create chances and Argentina, who missed five penalty kicks, enjoyed the majority of possession in what was described as a "grindathon" by England head coach, Eddie Jones.
At one point during the match, angry Jones was caught by TV cameras launching a foul-mouthed outburst in the stands after a mistake by his team -- he was asked about it in the post-match news conference.
"We want to play good rugby so I don't think there's any reason why I shouldn't be frustrated," said Jones, who has said from day one that his main focus is winning the 2019 World Cup in Japan.
VALUE FOR MONEY
Jones reacted angrily when asked if fans paying roughly $131 for a ticket got value for money from the performance.
"I'm not an economist, I'm not a businessman," Jones said. "All I do is coach a rugby team and I try to get them to play as hard as we can. We might not have played well, but we played hard so I'm disappointed in the question. "I'm sorry guys if you didn't think we tried. I'm really disappointed."
AUSTRALIA UP NEXT
Two of England's Lions stars, Owen Farrell and Maro Itoje, were rested for the Argentina game but are expected to return for the biggest test of the autumn against Australia, who beat Wales 29-21 in Cardiff on Saturday.
Jones, 57, who was born in Australia, expects his players to be "much better" after another week's training and he's relishing the prospect of playing the Wallabies, a side he coached between 2001 and 2005.
"We're hoping Australia bring their absolute best game so we can see where we're at," said Jones who has lost just one of his 21 games as England coach and beaten Australia four times in that period. "We've got a very clear vision of how we want to play against them, it should be fun. I'm obviously not going to share it with you though."

Russia vetoes Syria gas attacks probe extension
UN: Russia on Thursday cast its veto at the UN Security Council to block the extension of a UN-led investigation to determine who is behind chemical weapons attacks in Syria.
It was the tenth time that Russia has used its veto power to stop council action that targeted its ally Syria.
Russia and the United States had put forward rival draft resolutions on renewing for a year the mandate of the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), tasked with identifying the perpetrators of chemical attacks.
After Moscow vetoed the US draft resolution, the Russian-drafted measure failed to garner the nine votes required for adoption.
Addressing the council, US Ambassador Nikki Haley assailed the veto as a deep blow, saying Russia has killed the investigative mechanism which has overwhelming support of this council. By eliminating our ability to identify the attackers, Russia has undermined our ability to deter future attacks.
The message to anyone listening is clear: in effect, Russia accepts the use of chemical weapons in Syria, she said.
A resolution requires nine votes to be adopted at the council, but five countries -- Russia, Britain, China, France and the United States -- can block adoption with their veto power.
Russia has sharply criticized the JIM after its latest report blamed the Syrian air force for a sarin gas attack on the opposition-held village of Khan Sheikhun that left scores dead.
The attack on April 4 triggered global outrage as images of dying children were shown worldwide, prompting the United States to launch missile strikes on a Syrian air base a few days later.
Syria has denied using chemical weapons, with strong backing from Russia.
Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said the investigation of the Khan Sheikhun attack suffered from fundamental flaws and he again questioned the findings of the report.
The US measure, he argued, was geared toward entrenching the inherent flaws of the JIM and would not have improved the panel's work.
In its draft, Russia had insisted that the panel's findings on Khan Sheikhun be put aside to allow for another full-scale and high-quality investigation by the JIM.
The Russian veto came as the United Nations was preparing to convene in Geneva on November 28 a new round of talks to end the six-year war and underscored deep divisions over Syria.
Despite the veto, several countries such as Kazakhstan and Ethiopia appealed for another last-ditch effort to save the investigative panel. Its mandate ends at midnight Thursday.
Eleven of the council's 15 members voted in favor of the US-drafted resolution, while Egypt and China abstained. Bolivia joined Russia in voting against the measure.
Russia, China, Bolivia and Kazakhstan voted in favour of the Russian draft, while seven countries opposed it.Four countries abstained: Ethiopia, Senegal, Egypt and Japan.
French Ambassador Francois Delattre said the Russian veto was a blow to international efforts to curb the use of chemical weapons.
Let there be no doubt: we have unleashed a monster here, said Delattre.
The joint UN-Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) panel was set up by Russia and the United States in 2015 and unanimously endorsed by the council, which renewed its mandate last year.
Previous reports by the JIM have found that Syrian government forces were responsible for chlorine attacks on three villages in 2014 and 2015, and that the Islamic State group used mustard gas in 2015. - AFP

'Semata Sevana' not a dream: Sajith
The Semata Sevana housing programme is not a dream but a reality, said Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa.
He was addressing the gathering at the distribution of funds for the Janasuwaya community water supply project at Magama in Tissamaharama.
The minister said he distributed Rs. 2,776,000 among the beneficiaries. He added that this was not the only community water supply project but several other such projects were implemented at Gonagamuwa, Nedigamwil and Ellegala. The minister said the third budget of the Yahapalanaya regime was presented recently. A large sum of money was allocated for the Housing and Construction Ministry. As such, by 2025, housing for all citizens would be realized.
He said there is a sector of people who oppose the housing project for reasons unknown. It was the henchmen of the then rulers who obtained houses while those who did not have shelter did not get houses. The less fortunate, down trodden people who lived in slums did not get houses, he said. The minister said that a programme known as Sonduru Piyasa housing programme is being implemented by the Housing Development Authority.

KANDY SPORT ROUND UP
Soldiers up in the hills tomorrow
Tomorrow, Kandy SC will be looking to secure their third win in a row when they face Army SC in their third game, at Nittawela. Coach Sean Wijesinghe has worked hard to get the best out of his players. The soldiers coached by a Kandy product Nilufer Ibrahim will go all out to give Kandy SC a tough time. Taking rugby fans back to a memorable rugby match that was played at Longden Place in 1977 Kandy SC led by Sunil Munasinghe put up a brave show against the soldiers before losing 31-7 in a knockout quarterfinal game. It was schoolboys from St. Anthonys. Dharmaraja, St. Sylvesters, Vidyartha, Kingswood and Sri Rahula who contributed 12 players out of the fifteen for KSC. Kandy had two easy chances of scoring had not Nihal Viper Gunaratne not dropped the ball in front of the line on each occasions.
The man who helped the soldiers to do well was S.P. de Silva who scored a try, goaled three tries and put over a penalty. Kingswoodian Jerome Gray, scored KSCs solitary try. Gamini Fernando refereed the game. In that year, the Clifford Cup was awarded to the league champions and the knockout was played for SLRFU President's Trophy.
Kandy Rugby Fans
The Kandy fans are very much concerned about the decision taken by the Rugby Union to suspend Shehan Pathirana for four matches.
If the video clip is checked it is evident that the infringements were never intentional.
The incident that was cited by the CMO occurred when a CH player broke away from the back of the scrum and was going to cause an issue in the Kandy defence when at the same time Pathirana attempted to clear the ball. Under the World Rugby regulation 17 Sub - Section 22 with regulation to appeal - Section 17, 22, 2, (a) may appeal to the appeal board committee. The fans request the SLRU to reconsider the ban, whilst regretting the injury caused to the CH player.
Senkadagala Motor Sports Rally 2017

Sri Lanka awash with new developments - Minister Sagala
Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayake yesterday said the United National Party in the National Government has made vast strides in bringing permanent peace and stability to the country.
He said they succeeded in reducing serious crimes in the country by one third, and they are committed in driving the crime wave down further.
We have regained our GSP+ status by strengthening the rule of law and giving people back their rights, providing a lifeline to the apparel and fisheries industries and will bring tens of thousands of jobs.
The Minister added that the peace and security that they have brought has seen the tourism numbers reach record highs.
The full statement:
Sri Lanka is awash with new developments, the construction of roads, schools, hospitals and local council buildings. These are all concrete signs of a government building a stronger economy and a country moving definitively forward. We are modernising our most strategic industries, and investing into nascent industries that will support our transition to a knowledge based economy. All this is happening against a backdrop of newfound peace and stability. This government is clear that economic growth can only continue as along as peace and stability are maintained. This is why the 2018 budget has identified a number of areas for investment that will both enhance and modernise our law and order services.After two and half years of the UNP in national government, Sri Lanka is safer than it has been in three decades. This stability has opened up all manner of opportunities, social and economic  the two go hand in hand, its a simple equation: a stronger economy means more wealth, more wealth means more public spending.
Security is also incredibly important to us at personal level  without it we have no certainty over the physical and emotional well-being of ourselves or our families. This kind of uncertainty and trauma can have long lasting effects on us as individuals. Our jobs and livelihoods also depend on stability and security. Some of our most important industries, such as tourism are incredibly sensitive to stability and security, foreign investment, which bring hundreds of thousands of jobs is also highly dependent on stability. There can be no doubt about it, peace and security are absolute prerequisites for economic growth, jobs and well-being. So, as a government and as a society, we must continue to prioritise this. Three years ago we were on a trajectory that would bring almost certain economic collapse, social divides and tensions were rising again, and families feared for their childrens safety. You would be hard pressed to find a Sri Lankan that does not agree that our history in recent decades has been a traumatic one. Our institutions and arms of government were often used against the people they were meant to protect. People were robbed of their rights, their freedoms were taken away and people suffered, as the rule of law slowly disintegrated.
In two years, the UNP in national government, has achieved a lot to bring peace and stability. We have already reduced serious crime by a third and we want to drive this down further. We have regained our GSP+ status by strengthening the rule of law and giving people back their rights, providing a lifeline to the apparel and fisheries industries and will bring tens of thousands of jobs. The peace and security that we have brought has seen our tourism numbers reach record highs  last year we had over 2 million tourists for the first time in our history.
This is much needed money into our economy and tens of thousands of jobs.Our law enforcement services have been instrumental in achieving the stability we have today and the 2018 budget will allow us to further strengthen these capabilities. Steps are being taken to professionalise and modernise these services, to bring them in line with international standards. Rs. 125 million has been allocated to build a police and criminal justice university. We will be investing as much as Rs. 440 million into leveraging technology to develop our cyber-crime capabilities and increase the efficiency of services. We will also be introducing a special high court with an audio and visual recording system. There is serious momentum behind improving these services so that we have a better, safer society.
It is clear that we are moving forward and we have achieved a lot across many areas that impact ordinary people. We have created over 400,000 jobs, and this will only increase as we tackle unemployment head on. We have helped over 200,000 families secure a home and we are on track to meet our target of ensuring all Sri Lankans have shelter by 2015.
We are supporting pregnant women by providing them with Rs. 20,000. We know the cost of living in a challenge for people, so we are putting more money in peoples hands to help make ends meet through public sector salary increases and bringing down the cost of essential items  we have reduced fuel by 22%. This has all been possible because of the measures we have taken to build stronger economy and bring stability to our country.The steps we are taking are the right ones and the progress we have made has been widely recognised by the international community.
We are developing and enhancing law enforcement services to support the empowerment of people by ensuring their safety. Security is essential to everything we are working to achieve, it underpins our economic growth and social development. We must not let those who sought to bring economic and social chaos to our country influence our decisions and threaten our newfound peace and prosperity.
Only this government has the knowledge and ability to fix our economy. And only this government is trusted by the international community to deliver a fair and just economy where foreign companies will invest.
Only by sticking to our plan to strengthen our economy can we keep Sri Lanka on the path to a better future and ensure our countrys long term stability and security.

Remembering Venerable Sobitha Thera:
TIRELESS CAMPAIGNER FOR JUSTICE AND FAIR PLAY
The late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera did not expect any personal benefits or privileges when he launched the movement for a fair and just society. He had no regrets for spearheading the campaign to defeat Mahinda Rajapaksa at the 2015 presidential election. His sole objective was to bring about a government dedicated towards the creation of a just society.
The people who joined hands with him in his crusade have no regrets either. Although the present government is facing serious criticism, the law abiding citizens of this country never aspire to bring back a Rajapaksa regime to power. Had Rajapaksa been re-elected to power in 2015 the fate that would have befallen on those who tried to defeat him needed no explanation. But today those who tried to defeat the Common Candidate at the presidential election seemed to be the victors and the hopes of the 6.2 million people who ensured his victory are being dimmed in an unkind manner.
This is stated by Prof Sarath Wijesooriya in a book published to mark the second death anniversary of the Ven. Sobitha Thera recently. Wijesooriya states that Ven. Sobitha Thera had to face insult and disgrace both during the Presidential election and after the victory of the Common Candidate. But he always dismissed such abuse and flak as minute when compared to the enormous flak and abuse faced by the Buddha himself.
The government formed after the January 8 victory appointed a council headed by the President and Prime Minister and known as the National Executive Council to fulfil the pledges held out to the people.
Democratic governance
Today certain Bhikkhus who were trying to spread hate by talking about the country, nation and religion in an incensed manner on the topic of a new constitution were only insulting Buddhism. Instead of taking Ven Sobitha Thera as an example and contributing towards the welfare of the country, certain young Bhikkhus were trying to spell disaster to the country by spreading communalism compared to them the manner in which Ven. Sobitha Thera reflected on him during the last stages of his life was excellent. The 10 point plan he submitted after the Presidential election was a clear indication of this.
The 10-point plan evinced a basis with a deep vision to rekindle peoples minds towards democratic governance, supremacy of the law, communal and religious harmony, strengthening the local economy, development of infrastructure facilities including education and health, stabilising human rights and freedom, protection of women and children, environmental conservations and a disciplined and law abiding society.
Any one reading Ven. Sobitha Thera's 10-point plan with patience will realise that his only expectation was to create a disciplined country upholding humanism and ensuring social justice. It was true that bringing about these reforms were no easy task emergence of narrow political agendas of political parties including the two main parties involved in a power struggle had diminished the hopes of the public.
Ven. Sobitha Thera said that we should govern the country through a parliament comprising disciplined people's representatives. Drug addicts, gamblers, womanizers, child abusers and people misappropriating state assets should not be given nominations by all parties at future elections. All parties signed the March 12 declaration regarding nominations submitted by PAFFREL. But it should be passed as an act of parliament to give it teeth as mentioned by the Elections Commissioner. Ven. Sobitha Thera also emphasised that an environment should be created for government servants and trained Foreign Service personnel to carry out their duties without political interference. One reason for the unpopularity of the government was that certain officials who dreamt of a Rajapaksa regime once again were still holding high positions in government. Ven. Sobitha Thera who spoke with agitation about the damage caused to the Judiciary during the previous regime campaigned for the restoration of the independence of the Judiciary.
Judicial reforms were quintessential to realise the goals the people expected from the Yahapalana government. A three-member or five-member commission should be appointed by Parliament to recommend necessary reforms to ensure an independent Judiciary, Wijesooriya says. It was mostly the naked communalists who branded members of NGOs as betrayers of the nation and Western Conspirators'. It was wrong to band all NGOs together in making this allegation when NGOs opposed the killing of innocent citizens and misappropriation of state assets and public finds it was stupid to condemn them as those raising their voice for dollars incensed by communalism. Today struggle of the civil society is to retrieve the political culture which was distorted by the Rajapaksa regime restored. Criminals and corrupt people should not be given any protection.
New constitution
The discussion about the need to adopt a new constitution and take steps towards the future welfare of the country had been going on for the last three decades or more. It was not only the Common Candidate who mooted the need to abolish the executive presidency, reform the system of election, devolve power and establish harmony during the 2015 presidential election. Former President Rajapaksa too pledged this in his election manifesto the fact that 6.2 million people had given a mandate for a new constitution had to be accepted by everyone without question. It was well known that the government had laid the foundation for a new constitution by now.
Communal polities gaining ground should not be allowed to prevent a bold step towards the introduction of political reforms. If the government was able to usher in peace, unity and harmony for all citizens the hackneyed word minorities would get excluded from the vocabulary.
The dedication made by the Tamil speaking community towards a political solution should not be underestimated. Opposition Leader R. Sambandan had clearly stated that he expected a political solution with the agreement of this Sinhala community and that he opposed a division of the country. A campaign should be launched to educate the people about the need for political reforms and thwart attempts made to corrupt peoples minds to look at Sambandan, President, Prime Minister and Speaker with suspicion.
The two main parties should grab this golden opportunity which has arrived to adopt a new constitution without allowing it to be lost due to a power struggle. The accomplishment of this task would be a best tribute which could be paid to the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera says Sarath Wijesooriya.

Woman held with infant for two years acquitted
A woman, remanded with her infant for over two years on a drug trafficking case, was acquitted by Panadura Provincial High Court Judge Padmini Ranawaka Gunatilleka, stating that the accusation is false.
The Judge said in open Court on November 10 that the Defence Counsel had cross-examined the Police officers and has proved that this case was fabricated against the accused woman, who was charged with possessing and trafficking heroin weighing 3.64 grams.
The heroin was found in her house at Angulana in Moratuwa.
After a lengthy trial, the Judge said the Court is not in a position to accept the evidence given by the police regarding the raid they conducted in the house on December 16, 2013.
The police had wanted to arrest the husband of the accused woman who was identified as an army deserter.
When they conducted the raid, the suspect was not at home. However, the police arrested the woman identified as the suspects wife. After searching the premises, the police found packets of heroin in the house.
The woman was produced before the Moratuwa Magistrate and remanded with her infant for two years.
According to the evidence, the Judge said that the Court is not completely satisfied with the evidence produced by the Police.
Attorney-at-law Samadara Jayasinghe defending the accused informed Court that according to the evidence, it is clear that they had fabricated the case against the accused to take revenge on her husband.
The Judge acquitted the accused woman.

Journalists enjoying freedom of expression
Journalists are enjoying the freedom of expression under the Yahapalanaya regime. Earlier, white vans would make them disappear if they wrote against or criticized the regime.
They also have the right to criticize the government without hesitation because they will not be taken to task as a result of criticizing the government, said Fisheries State Minister Dilip Vedarachchi.
The State Minister was addressing journalists of the Hambantota district at the rural bank auditorium in Tangalle.
He said journalists in the district are in the low income group. He said, yet, they are towers of strength and beacons of hope for the country.
They render a service without expecting benefits from society.
He requested the Board of Management of the Hambantota Journalists Association to make him aware of any shortcomings or problems faced by journalists. He said he will award Rs. 100,000 from his DCB funds for the progress of the association.
The State Minister said there was a separate media committee at Temple Trees in the past to manage media activities. However, there is no such thing today.

Prof. Gunapala Malalasekera espoused Buddhist education
Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama recalled Prof. Gunapala Malalasekara's contributions to Buddhism and Buddhist education in Sri Lanka and the world.
Speaking at the Prof. Gunapala Malalasekara Commemoration Ceremony at the BMICH recently, Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama recalled the professors contributions to Buddhism and Buddhist education in Sri Lanka and around the world.
He explained how most Buddhist texts are not written in Sinhala but in Pali.
Amunugama said a very significant aspect of the Buddhist revival was to draw the attention of the world to the Pali language and to bring about a revival of that language through the publication of the storehouse of Pali texts.
G.P. Malalasekara was the chief lieutenant in that endeavour.
Amunugama also praised Malalasekaras commitment to Buddhist education, demonstrated through his tenures at Ananda, Nalanda, Dharmaraja and Dharmasoka Colleges.
Malalasekara made a huge contribution by helping to produce through Ananda and Nalanda, a large number of national leaders and social workers at different levels.
Amunugama concluded his speech with a number of anecdotes regarding Malalasekara. One, specifically, involved the influence Amunugama says Malalasekara had over Buddhism and geopolitics worldwide.
Something that most people probably do not know is that he inaugurated the World Buddhist Congress and started a dialogue with Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the Harijan leader of India.That led to Ambedkar embracing Buddhism. That in turn led to Harijans, who constitute one fourth or one fifth of the population of India, embracing Buddhism, Amunugama said.
The entire historical development and politics of India underwent a change because of this turn of events.

Advanced air traffic control  equipment for Ratmalana airport
The Automatic Dependence Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) Operations at the Area Control Centre at the Colombo Airport in Ratmalana was inaugurated by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva.
The Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) is considered as one of the latest developments in the surveillance technologies used for Air Traffic Control purposes.
The ADS-B system provides radar-like information to the Air Traffic control Centres on ground to determine the position, altitude and speed of aircraft in-flight based on specific type of messages broadcast by the aircraft which containing its position information derived from the GPS. Its less costly as it does not involve any Transmitters on Ground but only a set of Receivers located at selected locations in the country to capture the signals emitted by the aircraft, which are sent to a Central Processing Unit, which present the positional information of Aircraft within the applicable range, to the Air Traffic Control Centres on ground.
The ADS-B implementation project was awarded to ERA a.s of Czech Republic through an international competitive bidding process. The ADS-B system has been successfully tested and Flight Inspected in July 2017. ADS-B data received from all five Receivers located at BIA, MRIA, Pidurutalagala, Kilinochchi and Suriyakanda are now successfully fused and integrated with the existing Air Traffic Management (ATM) System at the Area Control Centre located at Ratmalana Airport.
The inauguration of ADS-B operations of Sri Lanka by Civil Aviation Minister at Colombo Area Control Centre, Ratmalana Airport coincides with the 13th Meeting of South East Asia and Bay of Bengal Sub-regional Working Group of ICAO and in the presence of this group of international experts of ADS-B, which was quite an achievement and a pride to Sri Lanka, to be in par with more developed countries in this region and across the world.

Beaten by India in the semi-finals last year, Afghanistan went one step further at the Kinrara Oval as they look to repeat their group stage win over Pakistan on Nov 10 in a tournament which has already seen several surprise results.
This also includes Nepal's stunning win over three-time champions India in the group stage but Afghanistan proved the stronger of the two surprise semi-finalists. After losing the toss and being put into bat, Nepal struggled to stem the flow of wickets despite Anil Kumar Shah belting 50 runs off 57 balls.
But no other Nepal batsmen reached double figures as they were bundled out for 103 in 28 overs with Mujeeb Ur Rahman claiming six wickets for 28, including all of Nepal's top-five batsmen.
Rahmanullah Gurbaz led Afghanistan's reply as they took just 20.3 overs to reach 108 for three despite having to wait out a rain delay when just 10 runs from victory.
Gurbaz hit nine fours and two sixes in his 65-ball knock before falling to Sandeep Lamicchane, who on Tuesday claimed five wickets in Nepal's win over Malaysia to book a semi-final spot.
Darwish Abdul Rasool, however, hit two successive sixes to take Afghanistan over the line and into their first major Under-19 final against Pakistan, who edged Bangladesh by two runs under the Duckworth-Lewis method yesterday. Pakistan will be playing in their third final in four editions on Sunday after being declared joint-champions with India in 2012 when the final ended in a tie before going down by 40 runs to India in the 2014 final.
Prior to their elevation to Test status, Afghanistan won the ACC Under-19 Elite Cup in 2011 and 2013 and the ACC Under-19 Premier League title in 2014 and 2015. Scores: Nepal: 103 off 28 overs (A.Sah 50; M.Ur Rahman 6/28) Afghanistan: 108-3 off 20.3 overs (R.Gurbaz 71)

All party consent to be taken to establish Sainthamaruthu PS - Minister Mustapha
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha Mustapha said the final decision to establish a Pradeshiya Sabha in Sainthamaruthu will be taken with the consent of all relevant political parties of that area.
Minister Faiszer Mustapha met Opposition Leader R. Sampathan, MP M.A Sumanthiran and representatives from other main political parties yesterday.
They discussed about the request to establish a Pradeshiya Sabha in Sainthamaruthu.
The meeting was held at the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government.
The Minister and the leaders of the political parties who were present decided to have another meeting on November 22 to discuss the matter further.
People from Sainthamaruthu have been demanding for a separate Pradeshiya sabha in Sainthamaruthu, from the Kalmunai Municipal Council since 1988. However, it gained momentum only after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe promised during his election campaign that he would establish a Pradeshiya Sabha in Sainthamaruthu.
Minister Mustapha said the President and the Prime Minister also insisted that a final decision regarding a separate local government authority for Sainthamarithu cannot be taken without the consent of all political parties in that area.
MP Maavai Senadhirajah and MP H.M.M Haris of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) were also present at the meeting.

When the case came up before Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne, the suspect was not present in Court.
The Court was informed that the suspect has gone abroad for medical treatment with Court permission but failed to return before the due date.
The FCID alleged that the suspect had misappropriated the concerned amount committed during the purchase of a building to house the Sri Lankan embassy at 3025, White Haven Street, Washington 20008. The former ambassador had allegedly remitted this money to Sri Lanka. The former Ambassador is a close relative of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Ash mountain in Norochcholai causing environmental crisis
The ash mountain accumulated by the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant is causing an acute environmental and social crisis threatening community life in the area, National Policy and Economic Affairs State Minister Niroshan Perera said.
He was making a special statement to the media after an inspection tour of the ash mountain and the surrounding areas to inspect the harm caused to community life. State Minister Perera said the UNP joined hands with the people in the area and conducted protest campaigns against the plant when it was being built by the former regime.
Environmental sensitivities should have been taken into account when putting up plants of this kind in a highly populated area, he said.
People in the area had to be victims due to the absence of a proper waste management scheme to the CEB.
The State Minister said the problem was aggravated due to the low quality of coal used for the plant.
The CEB had failed to provide a solution to the problem as promised. An example is the spending of billions of rupees for purchasing electricity from the private sector at short notice.
The people suffering due to the Norochcholai ash mountain have suspicions about the proposed Aruwakkadu Waste Management project too.

## Title: Budget vote gives cheers to unity in Parliament

Budget vote gives cheers to unity in Parliament
The passage with a two-thirds majority of the third Budget of the National Unity government presented by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera,  with 151 voting for and 58 against  certainly gives new strength to the Government, as it moves to face the coming Local Government polls, with the rivalry between the two coalition partners  the UNP and SLFP.
With the JVP voting against the Budget, even with only six members in the House, and the TNAs 16 members voting with Government, does not show a major shift in the parliamentary strength of government, with the total opposition to the Budget being 51. The absence of government members at voting time was matched, knowingly or not, by the absence of Joint Opposition (JO) members, including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The Budget will now move to the Committee Stage that could see amendments on proposals which include opening up the Shipping Sector to wider foreign investment, and possibly the much debated aspect of the lower duty on beer, with higher duty on Special Arrack.
The Second Reading debate was that of a limited discussion of the wider economic policies of the Budget proposals, with more publicity drawn by the issue of beer and Special or Gal Arrack. The futurist aspects of the Budget, such as the goal to end carbon fuel cars by 2024, the Carbon Tax, moves to increase electric vehicles, changes to the three-wheel presence on roads, and moves towards a greener society, did not get the analytical debate these proposals deserved; which showed a wider lack of interest in the aspect of combating environmental pollution. In this context, it is questionable whether the concept of a Blue-Green or Neela-Haritha Budget was in the substance of the proposals or it meant the colours of the two parties of the coalition.
The criticism of the lower duty on beer and the higher rate on Special Arrack is certainly of interest, especially when coming from the medical profession. But, there is also the danger that this debate extending from an attack on the sale and use of alcohol, to an extremist attack on the supply, sale and use of alcohol. This showed signs of moving similar to the debate of the old Temperance Movement, which was linked more with anti-colonialism and supported by those engaged in the sale of foreign liquor not sold in local taverns. It would be interesting to have a study on how much the kassippu or moonshine industry expanded and established itself in the areas that were declared dry and taverns were closed down in the Temperance Campaign.
Constitutional twist
While the debate on the Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constituent Assembly ended, there is a new twist to the discussion of a new constitution brought by former Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, who is making a case that the Constituent Assembly process is illegal, and even challenging the Speakers decision to allow this debate.
Rajapakshe broke an extended silence in politics, after his departure from the portfolios of Justice and Buddha Sasana, and now gives the impression he is one with special knowledge of the legal process of constitution making, and playing up to the anti-constitutional reform process expressed by sections of the Sangha.
What is most shocking in this Rajapakshe exercise is that he has taken so long to learn of any faults in the Constituent Assembly process, having been one of the Members of Parliament, and Minister of the Cabinet, who initiated this entire process, while being the Minister of Justice and Buddha Sasana.
The best response to him came from the TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran, who said: Id like to point out that he is one of the original proposers of the resolution that was placed before Parliament on January 9, 2016, which proposed the setting up of this Constitutional Assembly, and He is actually one of the drafters of that resolution having proposed it to Parliament. He has also been a member of the Steering Committee, which met 73 times and he has attended more than 50 times and participated fully in that process. He has even drafted certain portions of the Interim Report that was tabled before the Constitutional Assembly recently,
As Sumanthiran stated, it is good to know this opponent of the constitution reform process is a Presidents Counsel, has two doctoral degrees, and was also the President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka.
As Rajapakshe comes with this clearly gallery oriented attack on the move to draft a new constitution, he displays the reality that legal qualifications and academic doctorates, even in Buddhism, do not always provide the substance of quality in thinking and addressing issues of national importance, without the limitations of political expediency and crookedness.
This Rajapakshe episode is one more example of the decline of our political system and the need for changes to the manner in which persons are to be elected to parliament or to be members of the National List. It is certainly not education alone that should be sought in the selection of persons who will act with genuine interest of social progress in the legislature, which holds the sovereignty of the people. There is little chance that such persons of quality will be what are being looked for in candidates for the coming Local Government polls. But, organisations of civil society will certainly have to look at this aspect of candidates, when looking at the coming General Election, possibly in 2020. Wijeyadasa Rajepakshes must be the stuff certainly left out.
Fighting corruption
In a situation where the government has had to face considerable criticism for delay in fighting corruption, especially the fraud and corruption of the past Rajapaksa Regime, there are signs that this fight, a major pledge given to the people in the yahapalana election campaigns in 2015, is moving towards more firm and speedy action.
An important aspect of fast tracking this fight came with the decision of the UNP Working Committee to appoint a progress evaluation committee to look into the investigations conducted by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division of the Police and other law enforcement agencies on corruption.
The Working Committee did express its concerns on the slow pace of investigations into corruption, and delays in achieving the objective of bringing persons involved to justice.
The Working Committee commends the budgetary proposal to establish three new anti-corruption High Courts as a significant move. Similarly welcome are the proposals to appoint three-judge Benches to all anti-corruption High Courts, allowing appeals from these courts direct to the Supreme Court, as well as increasing the staff of the Attorney Generals Department, with a special unit there to deal with corruption issues. The more practical aspects of this fight against corruption are the two cases now before the courts. One is the Almanac Case involving Basil Rajapaksa, former Economic Development Minister and another, before the Colombo High Court, charged with the alleged misappropriation of Rs. 29.4 million of funds belonging to the Divi Neguma Department for the alleged printing of five million almanacs with the image of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, to be used as election propaganda for the Presidential Election of January 2015.
The other is the case where the former Chief of Staff of President Rajapaksa, Gamini Senarath and two others, who have been committed to Remand Prison custody by the Fort Magistrate, on allegations of having misused Rs. 4 billion of public funds to build a hotel at Hambantota, without Cabinet approval for such expenditure. Senarath was the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation and its subsidiary Litro Gas, which were allegedly involved in this use of funds through a subsidiary company, which included funds from the Employees Provident Fund, too.
Tattoo failure
From a different perspective, the Supreme Court did give an important judgment in awarding Rs. 800,000 damages to British national, Naomi Michele Coleman, who was wrongly charged in 2014 for having a tattoo of an image of the Buddha on her shoulder, as a matter that would have caused public unrest. The Supreme Court held that the Katunayake Police had violated the Fundamental Rights of the British tourist, arrested, detained and deported from Sri Lanka, for this alleged offence. The SC was of the view there was no acceptable evidence placed before the Court that there was the possibility of a public outcry (regarding the tattoo) though the police attempted to say so. It held that the issue of outraging the religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs could not be maintained.
The British national was a practicing Buddhist, who had come to Sri Lanka earlier with the tattoo and had come here for Buddhist activity, which activities she had been engaged in India, Nepal, Thailand and Cambodia. The deportation order had been given by the Negombo Magistrate without the necessary jurisdiction to do so.

## Supertitle:

Captain Steve Smith is the biggest threat to Englands Ashes glory
There are humble beginnings  and then there is the international career of Steve Smith.
Australias captain is the worlds No 1-ranked Test batsman, the first among equals in a group of twenty-something geniuses that includes Joe Root, Kane Williamson and Virat Kohli.
But it was not always thus. As Smith prepares to lead Australias efforts to regain the urn he lost in England in 2015, it is remarkable to reflect on his rise. The first impression England fans had of Smith was as a court-jester figure, brought in to lift Australian spirits during their disastrous 2010-11 Ashes campaign. He batted at six and seven, which sounded like a metaphor for the team as a whole. The joke fell flat.
Yet the first rung on his ladder had been even lower. When Smith made his Test debut against Pakistan at Lords in 2010, ostensibly as a leg-spinner, he batted at No 8 in the first innings and No 9 in the second. He made one and 12, and looked all over the place.
And when, a few months later, Australia lost at home to England for the first time in 24 years, Smith was cast adrift  a court jester without a court. He opted for a career change and set his sights on the throne.
Out went the wafts that had cost him his wicket against Englands seamers, and in came a resolute defence. He decided to go easy on the leg-spin and concentrate on his batting. Finally, he felt comfortable with his role.
While Smith retains a capacity for the outrageous  during the 2015 World Cup he memorably walked three feet outside off stump to deposit Pakistans Wahab Riaz over square leg  he employs it as an embellishment, not as his staple.The results have been frightening.
Since his Test recall in 2013, he has averaged 63 and scored 20 hundreds in 94 innings. Only Root has made more Test runs in that time, though from more innings, at a lower average (53.76) and with a relatively modest 13 centuries. Overall, only one batsman in the history of the game has hit more Test runs at a higher average than Smiths 59.66: Don Bradman.
It is a sobering stat for Englands bowlers to digest ahead of next weeks first Test in Brisbane. Even harder to take in, perhaps, is the thought that, had things taken a different twist, Smith could have been lining up at the Gabba alongside Root and Co, rather than looking implacable under the Baggy Green.
Smiths mother Gillian is from Kent and he has a British passport. When he left school at 17 to play league cricket in England, he was offered a contract by Surrey, and discussed his options with Tony Ward, a family friend in Sevenoaks. As any Australia captain would be duty-bound to do in such circumstances, Smith has always insisted his loyalties were to the country of his birth.
But Ward later told The Independent: He was really in two minds as to whether he should become English or not. The thought of Smith and Root batting together feels like one of sports great sliding-doors scenarios  crickets answer to Ronaldo teaming up with Messi.
Back in the real world, Smith has supplemented his world-class batting with an edge that is a contractual part of any Australia captains persona. He fell out with Kohli in India this year after looking to the dressing-room for advice on a DRS decision  a gesture Smith later described as a brain-fade.
Later in that series, he could be seen mouthing f***ing cheat after Murali Vijay claimed a catch on the bounce. Then, during the Champions Trophy, he called Eoin Morgans team predictable. England duly thrashed Australia at Edgbaston.
And ahead of this Ashes, he has been quick to reach for the old Aussie threat of opening a few scars  a reference to the Mitchell Johnson-inspired 5-0 win in 2013-14.
No matter that its England who hold the urn, though in fairness both teams have a tendency to disregard the most recent Ashes away from home.
In that respect, Smith still has a point to prove. While he was outstanding on the two flattest pitches of the 2015 series, scoring 215 at Lords and 143 at The Oval, he went missing on seaming tracks at Cardiff, Edgbaston and Trent Bridge. Englands task, then, is to get him early while the Kookaburra ball is still swinging.
That will be easier said than done. On Australias true surfaces, where Smiths exceptional hand-eye co-ordination allows him to hit through the line of the ball, he averages 68.
Against India in 2014-2015, he scored a century at Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney.
Englands secret fear is that he will add Perth to the list in the coming weeks and complete a full house. Stranger things have happened.

## Title: The evolution of women's sportswear
## Supertitle:

## Date: Saturday, November 18, 2017 - 01:00
The evolution of women's sportswear
In the early 20th century, women's sports clothing was not designed for them to excel, it was restrictive and affected their mobility. Donning long dresses and hats to keep the "feminine" look intact on court or field was not only uncomfortable but also impacted women's athletic performance.
Over the years, as women have become more active in sport, their sportswear has also become more practical - though there are some exceptions.
As part of the BBC 100 Women challenge tackling sexism in sport, we take a look at how women's sportswear has developed over the decades.
TENNIS
Women competed in the Olympic Games for the first time in 1900. Female athletes made up just over 2% of those taking part and competed in five sports, including tennis.
At the time women wore long skirts which covered their ankles and long sleeves.
French tennis player Suzanne Lenglen was revolutionary. As well as dominating female tennis in her era, she changed the style of women's dress. Lenglen swapped long skirts for short-sleeved pleated dresses to compete in style, and also wore a bandeau, which became her trademark.
"All women players should go on their knees in thankfulness to Suzanne for delivering them from the tyranny of corsets," said American tennis champion Elizabeth Ryan, a contemporary of Lenglen.
The clothes female tennis stars now wear is much more suited to the fast-paced nature of the modern game.
Players are also pushing the boundaries to be stylish on court. Tennis ace Venus Williams launched her own fashion label in 2007.
SYNCHRONISED SWIMMING
The sport is now synonymous with glitzy and colourful costumes, and waterproof make-up.
But it wasn't always like that.
The sport was introduced to the Olympics in 1984, and a lot of thought and time now goes into aesthetics.
Canadian competitor Erin Willson told the Globe and Mail newspaper ahead of the 2012 London Olympics: "We're a very artistic sport. So the the whole look is important.. you have have to have the perfect hair, the perfect suits, the perfect bodies."
HANDBALL
Isabela Fleury, Brazilian handball player and one of the BBC's 100 Women this year, is part of a Rio de Janeiro team who recently rebelled against standard beach handball bikini outfits for women, causing a media stir.
"The last time we tried to play we were wearing shorts and they asked us to take them off as they wanted us to wear speedos," she said. "We protested and they threatened us so we had to take the shorts off and wear bikinis to play the game. They are now changing the rules."
In 2014, a row also erupted in the Basque region of Spain after women beach handball players complained that the regulations for women's kit were sexist, with men allowed to wear loose clothing.
FOOTBALL
Women's football kits have links to the suffragette movement in Britain. Lady Florence Dixie, a prominent suffragette and president of the British Ladies Football Club, saw football as a weapon to subvert Victorian dress.
"There is no reason why football should not be played by women, and played well too, provided they dress rationally and relegate to limbo the straitjacket attire in which fashion delights to attire them," she wrote in 1895.
In 1921, the UK's Football Association banned women from playing on FA-affiliated pitches. It said football "was quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged". The ban was finally lifted in 1971.
In 2014, FIFA officially allowed players to wear head coverings, including hijabs, while playing football for religious reasons.
The world football body had previously banned headscarves by arguing they could put players at-risk of suffering a serious head or neck injury. - CNNa

Gotabhaya fixed in Avant-Garde case
A corruption case filed against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and seven others, was yesterday fixed for trial by the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court.
This is for allegedly causing a Rs.11.4 billion unlawful loss to the government when permitting Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd, to operate a floating armoury.
Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara fixed the case for trial on February 26 and March 26.
The Chief Magistrate decided to refuse preliminary objections raised by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, citing that the Director General of the Bribery Commission is vested with the power to file cases in the Magistrates Court in accordance with the Bribery Commission Act.
The defence had raised preliminary objections alleging that the Bribery Commission Director General had filed this case without the written sanction of the Bribery Commission.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Bribery Commission.

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against the eight accused under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the accused had given permission to Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd, to operate a floating armoury between August 7, 2012 and January 8, 2015, in violation of laws by providing unlawful income to this private company, amounting to Rs.11.4 billion.

History against All Blacks' Williams and Scotland
Edinburgh: Sonny Bill Williams confesses to being unaware that the All Blacks have never lost to Scotland but insists the back-to-back world champions are "on edge" as they prepare for a Test that falls on the 112th anniversary of the first match between the countries.
Since the 'Original' All Blacks beat Scotland 12-7 on a skating rink of a pitch at Inverleith in Edinburgh on November 18 1905, New Zealand have maintained an historic aura of invincibility against the Scots.
They've won 28 out of 30 Tests between the sides with two Murrayfield draws (0-0 in 1964 and 25-25 in 1983) the closest Scotland have come to victory.
"I wasn't aware of that," said Williams, retained at inside centre for Saturday's match at Murrayfield despite the mental aberration he suffered, together with a yellow card, when batting the ball out of play in the second half of the world champions' 38-18 win against France in Paris last weekend.
"Obviously it is motivation," the Blues player added, when asked about avoiding becoming a member of the first New Zealand side to fall to the Scots.
"But as All Blacks we always put pressure on ourselves to not just win but play well.
Last Saturday, Scotland leaked five tries in a 44-38 victory against a Samoa side the All Blacks thrashed 78-0 five months ago but Williams pointed to Scotlands 24-19 win against Australia in Sydney in June, in Gregor Townsends second match as coach, as a warning sign.
"It's really put us on the edge of our seats in our preparation, knowing that they can knock off the big boys," said Williams, whose mother is of Scottish descent.
"Theyve got some dangerous players and the flavour of the rugby theyre playing at the moment is great to see. Coming up against that has put us on edge."
All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has afforded Scotland the respect of selecting a full-strength side, the only change to the starting XV that beat France being the introduction of Codie Taylor for the injured Dane Coles at hooker.

Japanese railway apologises for early departure of train
JAPAN: A Japanese railway operator has issued a deep apology for the tremendous nuisance caused by a train departing 20 seconds early, surprising even a nation renowned for both punctuality and politeness.
The Tsukuba Express train linking Tokyo and the capital's northern suburbs pulled out of Minami Nagareyama Station at 9:44:20 instead of 9:44:40.
We deeply apologise for causing tremendous nuisance to customers, said the Tsukuba Express company.
There was no complaint from customers over this incident, said the firm, which added that no one missed the train due to the premature departure.
Japanese railway services, including shinkansen bullet trains, are famous for their world-beating punctuality.
Even the slightest delay prompts an effusive apology from the train guard, which often lasts longer than the hold-up itself.
With trains running the same route every few minutes to cope with huge numbers of passengers, even brief delays can back up the whole network causing overcrowding.
Stations in Toyko employs dozens of staff -- with their famous white gloves -- to ensure the prompt departure of trains and to manage the crush during rush hour.
The bullet trains in Japan are also famed for their customer service, with one offering passengers an onboard footbath to soothe their travelling woes.
The train firm said it was surprised by the attention the story was getting, saying: We have issued similar apologies for trains that departed earlier than scheduled before. A spokesman told AFP the apology was issued because strict safety procedures were not followed.
What matters is not the 20 seconds... The point is that our formal procedure should be this: A sound rings 15 seconds before the departure, followed by an announcement asking for caution due to the closing doors, and then the doors shut, he said.
Lax management could cause safety problems in the future, the spokesman said. There are sometimes passengers who try to jump on the train... they could be caught in doors if the doors shut without warning, he said. But the apology had several social media users scratching their heads.
This is surprising even to Japanese, said one user with the handle @takamin_.
A weird country in which a 20-second difference prompts a sincere apology while faking quality data on aluminium and steel products or misconduct on car check-ups are done just like that, another tweet read.

Panadura Provincial High Court Judge Padmini Ranawaka Gunatilleke told a lawyer appearing in a sexual abuse case against a man in robes on Thursday, that the law of the country is equal to all citizens and that no extraordinary treatment is granted for members of the clergy.
The accused had allegedly committed a sexual offence on an underage boy who had visited the temple.
Bhikkus must live in society upholding Buddhist principles. However, certain Bhikkus are not adhering to it but engage in nefarious activities and come before Court.
The laity is committed to safeguarding the Buddha Sasana rather than some Bhikkus, the Judge said.
Bhikkus must lead an exemplary life respecting the Buddha Sasana, the Judge added. The Attorney General indicted the man in robes residing at a temple in Kuda Uduwa in Horana with committing a sexual offence on a 16-year-old boy in December 2008. The lawyer moved that this case can be compounded. State Counsel K. V. Indika strongly objected to this application and told Court that the case could be fixed for trial. The Judge refused the application of the defence lawyer and fixed the case for trial on January 15, 2018.
The accused is on bail.

Mugabe makes defiant appearance
ZIMBABWE: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe attended a university graduation ceremony on Friday, making a defiant first public appearance since the military takeover that appeared to signal the end of his 37-year reign.
Mugabe, 93, had been confined to house arrest after the military took over the country.
But on Friday, he walked into the ceremony venue in Harare dressed in a blue academic gown and tasselled hat, before listening to speeches with his eyes closed and applauding occasionally, an AFP correspondent reported.
The generals took over late on Tuesday after vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa was abruptly sacked and Mugabe's wife Grace emerged in prime position to succeed her increasingly frail husband.
Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980.
Many citizens were stunned by the military's intervention, sparked by the bitter succession battle between Grace and Mnangagwa.
Analysts say the military leadership was strongly opposed to the rise of Mugabe's ambitious 52-year-old wife, while Mnangagwa has close ties to the defence establishment.
Mugabe and the army chiefs held talks on Thursday, but no official statement has been issued on the status of negotiations that could see him eased out of office.
Government television showed Mugabe, the world's oldest head of state, at Thursday's talks standing smiling alongside army chief General Constantino Chiwenga.
Mnangagwa, 75, was previously one of Mugabe's most loyal lieutenants, having worked alongside him for decades.
But he fled to South Africa following his dismissal and published a scathing rebuke of Mugabe's leadership and Grace's presidential ambitions.
The military said Friday they had detained some criminals in Mugabe's government in a reference to supporters of Grace's presidential ambitions.
Morgan Tsvangirai, a former Prime Minister and long-time opponent of Mugabe, told journalists in Harare on Thursday that Mugabe must resign in the interest of the people.
The international community has been watching the crisis closely.
In Paris, the head of the African Union, Guinea's President Alpha Conde, warned Thursday that the continent will never accept the military coup d'etat in Zimbabwe and called for a return to the constitutional order. - AFP

Nadal announced last year he would sue Roselyne Bachelot after she made comments in a television interview suggesting he had taken performance enhancing drugs in 2012. The Spaniard, who ended his season on Monday after losing to David Goffin at the ATP Finals, has vigorously denied any wrongdoing and said he would donate the money to a French NGO.
As you can see in the media, today is a happy day for me, my team and my fans, the 16-times grand slam champion said in a statement.

Navy-Havies will be a close game
The confrontation between Navy Sports Club and Havelock Sports Club in their Dialog A Division interclub league rugby first round match at Navy grounds in Welisara today should turn out to be a close game. The match will kick off at 3:45pm.
The Havies team who had a spectacular victory against the formidable Air Force SC in their first round game last week by 46 points to 23 came back to their normal pattern of play from the very first game that they played against Police SC this season where they registered a thumping (36 nil) victory. Havelocks have been training hard during the last few days and are determined to pull off a morale-boosting win while the Navy SC after winning the first game lost to a formidable CR and FC team last week, hence they will have to get their act together and be at their very best if they have to topple the high riding unbeaten table leaders Havies in their own den in Welisara.
The forte of Havelocks team has been their power-packed forwards.The Havies eight spearheaded by burly last years skipper Dushmantha Priyadarshana Bodhi ably supported by this year captain Jason Melder, Prasath Madushanka, Sharo Fernando, Shenal Deeelaka, and Shehan Dias have given a terrific display in the loose but today they will be up against the
Navy forwards of the caliber of Lanky Supun Peiris, Adeesha Weeratunga, last years skipper Roshan Ranasinghe, Kasun De Silva, Dulanjana Wijesinghe, Janith Laksara and omnipresent captain Danushka  Gertha Perera. In the set scrums the experienced Navy hooker Dulanjana Wijesinghe should get the better of his vis-a-vis Prasath Madusanka while in the line outs Sailors will have the edge in securing the ball position through their line out jumpers in Supun Peiris and Adeesha Weeratunga over the Havies duo of Sharo Fernando and Shehan Dias.
Navy SC won their first game against Army SC by (20-14) but lost the second game unexpectedly to the sensational CR & FC side by (23-38) last week. Even though they lost to CR their halves combination of Richie Darmapala and new comer Mohamad Abzal having clicked well in the last few matches,
the Navy outfit will hope that Richie will set his three quarters in motion at every turn as they have two hard running centres in experienced Musheen Faleel and young Lahiru Herath in addition to their young speedy wingers Buddhima Piyaratne and Supun Dilshan who has stood out with their powerful runs down the flank with full back Thilina Weerasinghe often joining the
line to form the overlap. Going by the two teams performance so far a close tussle for supremacy can be expected today at Navy grounds.
Navy SC (Probable XV) Roshan Ranasinghe, Dulanjana Wijesinghe, Kasun De Silva, Supun Peiris, Adeesha Weeratunga, Viraj Perera ,Danushka Gertha  Perera (Captain), Janith Laksara, Richie Darmapala and Mohamad Abzal, Buddhima Piyaratne, Musheen Faleel, Lahiru Herath, Supun Dilshan, Thilina Weerasinghe, Head Coach : Mothilal Jayathilake, Asst.Coach : Dev Anandh
Havelocks (Probable XV) Dushmantha Priyadarshana  Bodhi , Prasath Madushanka, Liston Flatney, Jason Melder (Captain), Shehan Dias, Sharo Fernando, Shenal Deelaka, Sithum Peiris, Sudam Sooriarachchi and Niroshan Fernando, Chamara Dabare, Nishon Perera, Hirantha Perera, Kevin Kutty Dixon, Reeza Mubarak, Head Coach: Sanath Martis

Paddy cultivation in 105,000 hectares in Mahaweli Zones
Under the Food Production Year 2018 - a concept of President Maithripala Sirisena - arrangements are being made for the cultivation of paddy in 105,000 hectares in 10 Mahaweli Zones including H, L, D, B, Huruluwewa, Moragahakanda, Walawa in 2017/2018 Maha cultivation season.
Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority Director General Gotabaya Jayaratne told the Daily News that 295,000 Mahaweli farmer families will contribute in this venture. President Maithripala Sirisena declared the Food Production Year 2018 programme at the Vap Magul ceremony held recently at Thibbatuwawa paddy field in Kekirawa in Huruluwewa Mahaweli Zone. This paddy field, extending 11 acres, will be maintained as a permanent model paddy cultivation area.
Our target is to grow paddy in 105,000 hectares in the Mahaweli development zones during the Maha season. Already, we have launched a programme to distribute agriculture appliances, seeds etc. to our farmer community on a 50 percent subsidized basis. Every officer, including the unit managers, as well as farmers have been given a target to be achieved at the zonal level, the Director General said.Meanwhile, it is planned to select the Best All-rounder Mahaweli Farmer of the 2017/2018 Maha season under the theme Lets go together - standup - let's fill our granaries. The ceremony will be held in August 2018 at Galnewa Mahaweli esplanade.
Referring to the current Maha cultivation seasonal activities, Jayaratne said the highest percentage of paddy harvest per hectare in the agricultural history was recorded in Mahaweli H area during the 2015/2016 Maha cultivation season. The Mahaweli farmers are being encouraged to achieve the target of seven metric tons per hectare in the Maha season. Mahaweli farmers are striving dedicatedly to enhance the harvest. During the recent drought, farmers in Mahaweli H area were able to produce 350,000 metric tons of soya, adequate to fulfill the country's seed soya requirement, Jayaratne pointed out.

Paine handed shock recall as Australia gamble for Ashes
Sydney: Wicketkeeper Tim Paine was handed a shock recall after a seven-year Test absence on Friday as Australia gambled on sweeping changes for the first two Ashes Tests against England.
Paine, who has not kept for Tasmania in their opening three Sheffield Shield games because of the presence of incumbent Test gloveman Matthew Wade, comes into the 13-man squad along with batsmen Cameron Bancroft and Shaun Marsh.
In a stunning selection, 32-year-old Paine, who was once on the brink of retirement over a serious finger fracture, was preferred to Wade and Peter Nevill for his first Test match since October 2010.
Bancroft, a 24-year-old right-hander, is in line for his Test debut at the expense of opening batsman Matthew Renshaw following a prolific series of scores for Western Australia in this season's domestic Sheffield Shield competition.
Bancroft, who is also a wicketkeeper, amassed an unbeaten 228 with other scores of 86, 76, 76 and 73 for his state side to force his Test claims, while Renshaw has struggled for runs for Queensland.
Shaun Marsh, 34, makes yet another return to the Australian side and is slated to bat at number six to shore up the batting instead of all-rounders Glenn Maxwell and Hilton Cartwright. Only five players survive from Australia's last Test against Bangladesh in September. The first Ashes Test is in Brisbane next week, with the second -- a day-night match -- in Adelaide from December 2.
The selections were described as "bombshells" in Australian press, while former Test bowler Stuart MacGill lashed the selectors as "morons".
"Ashes selections.... made by morons mascarading (sic) as mentors. Times (sic) up gents," he tweeted.
- 'Unconvincing performances' -
National selector Trevor Hohns said Paine has been in the sights of selectors despite being overlooked by Tasmania to play behind the stumps this season.
But he also hit out at the "unconvincing performances" of rival players, indicating that selectors felt their options were limited."He's (Paine) our Twenty20 'keeper and performs well there, his batting has been pretty good of late and the other side of it... is the unconvincing performances of other contenders," said Hohns, according to Australian media. Bancroft's weight of runs proved an irresistible claim based on form for selectors given Renshaw's run of low scores for Queensland.
"Cameron has been a player of interest to us for some time now, having been unlucky to miss out on the Test tour to Bangladesh that was cancelled in 2015," Hohns said. "He is a very talented and tough cricketer who shows a good temperament for Test cricket."
For Marsh, it is his eighth recall to the Australian Test team as selectors look for their best six batsmen in deference to the strong England bowling attack.
"Shaun is playing very well at the moment, having scored consistently in the One-Day Cup and first three rounds of the Sheffield Shield competition," Hohns said.Paceman Chadd Sayers has been added to the strong fast-bowling line-up in the squad along with Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Jackson Bird to give selectors options.
But Hohns said the selection panel did not feel Renshaw was batting well enough to merit Test selection.
"We still view Matthew as a player of immense talent, but he is out of form at the moment and we don't feel an Ashes Test match is the best place for him to find form," he said.
Australia - Steve Smith (capt), David Warner, Cameron Bancroft, Jackson Bird, Pat Cummins, Peter Handscomb, Josh Hazlewood, Usman Khawaja, Nathan Lyon, Shaun Marsh, Tim Paine, Chadd Sayers, Mitchell Starc.

Pakistan aims to increase Sri Lankan tourists
Pakistani travel companies interested in increasing the number of Sri Lankan tourists visiting Pakistan, visited Sri Lanka this week to hold discussions with the Pakistani High Commission in Sri Lanka and the national carrier, SriLankan Airlines to ease travel between the two countries.
The CEO of the Pakistani destination management company, Saiyah Yousaf Akhthar who was on a visit to Sri Lanka with a Pakistani tour group from November 8-15, said they held discussions with the two to increase Sri Lankan traffic to Pakistan.
The Pakistani High Commission assured that they would help ease the visa process for Sri Lankans who visit Pakistan. We are also working with SriLankan Airlines and tour operators here to prepare tour packages to Pakistan, said Akhthar.
They are to concentrate in the areas of leisure trips, adventure tourism and sports tourism. Akthar explained that tour packages involving these activities would also be tailored around the ideal season to visit the country.
We were told that Sri Lankans would be interested in seeing snow. So we are at present promoting visits to the K2 Mountain, explained Akthar whose wife, Uzbugy Khan, had scaled the Minglig Sar Mountain at an altitude of 6050m in October last year.
In addition, they would also have a special focus on increasing religious tourism into the country where people will be taken on the Buddhist circuit to visit ancient Buddhist sites. It would also touch on the Indus Civilizations of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa.
Aisha Khan, the Deputy Director of Crafts and Culture at the Walled City of Lahore Authority in the Government of Punjab who accompanied Akhthar on the tour, noted that at present, most visits to Pakistan from Sri Lanka were on business or official purposes and that few travelled there on leisure due to various misconceptions about the country.
We have not had any incidents with foreigners. And it is safe to travel. Local authorities will also provide police escorts to all tourists, she assured.
The Pakistanis, during their visit, also met 20 Sri Lankan tour operators and they are expected to visit Pakistan soon to check on conditions there and ways in which travel could be promoted between the two countries. The Sri Lankan Cricket team visited Lahore, so you should know that it is safe and we have a lot to offer, said Khan as Pakistan opens its doors and strives to promote itself a must visit place in South Asia.

Audit Commission inactive due to delay in passing legislation:COPE
JVP MP and COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti yesterday, said if the Government did not intend to present the National Audit Bill(NAB) in Parliament any sooner, to temporarily dissolve the Audit Commission.
The JVP MP opening the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday when the Finance Heads of Independent Commissions were taken up, pointed out that the Audit Commission had been inactive for two long years due to the delay in passing legislation.
Monthly, Rs 2 million is spent to pay salaries and maintain the 21-member office of the Audit Commission. It was set up under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, with the aim to broaden the powers of the AG to audit public institutions. In contrary, the amendments proposed to the Audit Bill on October 3 by the Cabinet appointed sub-committee, had scrapped the AGs powers and restricted his purview only to funds taken from the Consolidated Fund, while the AGs powers would be lesser than what he enjoyed before the 19th Amendment, he said.
The MP pointed out the work of the Auditor Generals Department had been hampered due to the inordinate delay of the Bill. The AGs Department has been paralyzed, but still is working on critical matters such as the hedging deal and Sri Lankan Airlines. In recent times, it had produced full reports on the rice importation scam and coal procurement controversy. The Government has to empower the AG, not weaken him. The Audit Bill saves the the Governments finances. This legislation was a priority task included in the 100-day work-programme, but it is a bill that had been held for the longest period by the Government, he added.
Handunnetti urged the Government to explicitly state a date when it would present the National Audit Bill to Parliament.
Commenting on the National Procurement Commission set up under the 19th Amendment, Handunnetti questioned as to how the country could experience a fuel shortage if the Commission had been working properly. What is the Commission doing If the procurement is being done properly, could there be a fuel shortage for the CPC he questioned.

Privileges of MPs blatantly violated:Bandula Gunawardena
Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in the country due a background where even local investors are backing off when many eminent figures in this country and also MPs are being dragged to the FCID and treated as criminals, said Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena.
He made these observations, joining the Committee Stage debate on the Budget proposal for the fiscal year 2018 under 24 financial heads including the President, Prime Minister, Supreme Court Judges and Cabinet of Ministers, which was taken up last morning in Parliament.
He said that privileges today of Members of Parliament were being blatantly violated. Parliament is being used to defame and tarnish the image of MPs. This is not a good sign of democracy.
Gunawardena said when certain MPs are chasing behind and attacking the former President who won the war and made this country safe for its people by not allowing the country to be divided and if they are taking revenge on him, we would never be able to usher in a new era for this country.

UNP not agreUNP not agreeable to another 20th Amendment to Constitution:Ajith P Perera
The UNP does not agree with another 20th Amendment to the Constitution that would merely change the election system through Constitutional Reforms process, said Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera in Parliament yesterday.
He said that a president who was answerable to Parliament could be elected, while granting executive powers to Parliament in tern, strengthening the people of the country. He further said that President Maithripala Sirisena was ready to grant all powers to Parliament if not for the Court Order. He added that executive powers should be granted to the Cabinet of Ministers. There is no such thing as an executive Prime Minister, said Deputy Minister Perera.
He also said that such a proposal should be tested at a referendum. He added that such a change should be made to solve the ethnic issue. He also added that the rights of the people in the North and South should be protected equally.
He made these observations, joining the Committee Stage debate on the Budget proposal for the fiscal year 2018 under 24 financial heads, including the President, Prime minister, Supreme Court Judges and Cabinet of Ministers, which was taken up last morning in Parliament.
The Deputy Minister also said that the 19th Amendment to the Constitution had balanced the powers of the Executive Presidency and Parliament to a certain extent.
Although Minister Samarasinghe said that the Executive Presidency should be retained, there is room for both sides to meet each other halfway, said Deputy Minister Perera.
He also said that there was no point in investigations if it delayed to take the suspects before Court or cases not being heard. He added that the issue of delay could be solved with an introduction of a new Act in January for hearing of corruption cases.
President, PM, Parliament and Commission Expenditure Heads passed
Expenditure Heads of the President, the Prime Minister, Parliament and Independent Commissions were passed unanimously in Parliament yesterday, without amendments during the Committee Stage of Budget 2018.
The Budget for the next year has allocated Rs 9.98 billion for the President and Rs 1.77 billion for the Prime Ministers Office. Parliament gets Rs 2.9 billion for the next year.
As the Committee stage debate commenced yesterday, 24 Expenditure Heads were taken up and were approved without amendments and without a division following a full days debate.

No knowledge of Arjuns involvement in Bond issue
UNP MP and COPE Committee member Hector Appuhamy said that he had no objections to an investigation being launched with regard to the telephone conversations with Arjun Aloysius and those conversations being released.
In fact I had no knowledge of his involvement in the bond scam until I joined the COPE Committee, he said.
However, it was revealed at the Bond Commission yesterday, that PTL Owner Arjun Aloysius had spoken to to several members of the COPE Committee during the period January 2015, including to Hector Appuhamy on 73 occasions.
Convening a press briefing at the Committee Room 4 in Parliament yesterday, he said Arjun Aloysius was a personal and business friend and he had spoken to him on many occasions. However, he said Aloysius had never asked him for favours and their relationship was strictly personal. Although we are politicians, we too are entitled to have a personal life and that should not be infringed upon. However, although I might have spoken to Aloysius on many occasions, I have never discussed the bond issue, he added.
However, responding to a media query on whether he had never spoken of the bond issue, he said, We may have touched on the topic, but we have not specifically spoken about it.
I am in full agreement with Minister Dayasiris request to the CID to reveal these conversations and determine who the perpetrators are. In fact we as the COPE Committee, have signed the COPE report that was handed over to the Commission Investigating the Bond Scam that enabled the investigation.
Hence, no one can point a finger at us. But investigations need to be carried out on all telephone conversations to determine who had been in contact with Arjun Aloysius, Appuhamy added.

Bond issue, network of corrupt persons:Chief Opp. Whip
A group of persons including a number of Parliamentarians are behind the Bond issue, but not a single person, as there is a network of corrupt persons in it, said Chief opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament yesterday.
He made these observations, joining the Committee Stage debate on the Budget proposal for the fiscal year 2018, under 24 financial heads, including the President, the Prime Minister, Supreme Court Judges and Cabinet of Ministers, which was taken up last morning in Parliament.
There are other members who have dealt with Perpetual Treasuries chief Arjun Aloysious, as there is a whole network of persons involved in corruption, Anura Kumara Dissanayake said. There are Central Bank officials, Business Community members and Politicians involved in this scam. All information on this corrupt network would be divulged without delay, he said.
He also said that those who were involved with Perpetual Treasuries chief attempted to create havoc at COPE meetings. He added that some of the COPE members attempted to threaten the Auditor General.
He said penalizing such culprits would be in the same manner the government would deal with for those found guilty of other financial frauds. He added that the Presidential Commission Investigating Serious Frauds have completed inquiries on 17 cases, such as the ITN, on the frauds involved in the opening ceremony of the Hambantota Port and on Avant Garde, where investigations are completed and yet what happens to them is anybodys guess.
Phone calls with Aloysius made before January 2015:Rajakaruna
UNP Parliamentarian Harshana Rajakaruna stated that the questioned telephone conversation with Perpetual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius had been made even before being elected to Parliament.
MP Rajakaruna said that all his telephone conversations with Aloysius were made before January 2015.
He also said Aloysius has been a friend to him as well as to his family. Arjun Aloysiuss grandfather had been a close friend of his father, MP Rajakaruna said. They became friends before I was born. Aloycious was known to me since my childhood.
He made these observations yesterday, raising a privilege matter in Parliament during the Committee Stage debate on Budget proposal for the financial year 2018 on a media report on the telephone calls that several members of the COPE had with Arjun Aloycious.
MP Rajakaruna said further that he as a member of the Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE), had not discussed matters on the investigations carried out by the same committee with Aloysius. One has to forget friendships and other relationships when he is a member of COPE, MP Rajakaruna said. That was the reason why we all signed the report of the COPE headed by MP Handunnetti and agreed with the recommendations made on it.
There is a malicious attempt to sling mud at COPE members, Harshana Rajakaruna, said. These types of allegations could be made even against the members of the government, because of the new political culture created by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe.
SLFP has not requested for delay of LG polls
As a party, the SLFP had not made any request to delay LG elections, while they intend appealing to the judiciary to permit the elections to he held, said Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
He made these comments in Parliament yesterday, joining the Committee Stage debate on the Budget proposal for the fiscal year 2018.
He said that there is a debate concerning the position the President. With the decentralisation of powers, the President that had been elected into office by the people, should be retained.
The powers that are found to be harmful to the executive presidency, had been revised to a great extent, but it is the stand of the SLFP that the presidency should be retained as the people voted for it, he said.
Minister de Silva said the danger in handing over powers to Parliament, especially, considering what was happening around the world, we could face a situation where in the case of a weak parliament, a majority would end up being controlled by the minority. That is why the SLFP has pondered on this issue deeply and taken this decision.
Commenting on the numerous investigations that are currently underway, he said the Attorney Generals Department, despite not having adequate officers to conduct these investigations, was carrying out a huge task of work.
