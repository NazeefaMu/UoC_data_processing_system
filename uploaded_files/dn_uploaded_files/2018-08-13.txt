Chelsea, Spurs off to winning starts, Richarlison shines for Everton
LONDON, Saturday - Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri got off to a winning Premier League start as new signing Jorginho slotted home coolly from the penalty spot in a 3-0 win at Huddersfield on Saturday.
Tottenham also made light of discontent over their lack of summer transfer activity by resisting a late Newcastle onslaught to win 2-1 at St James Park thanks to goals from Jan Vertonghen and Dele Alli.
Richarlison struck twice on debut for 10-man Everton to show he may justify his 50 million price tag and hold highly-fancied Wolves 2-2 on their return to the top flight.
And Watford, Bournemouth and Crystal Palace picked up 2-0 wins on the opening weekend of the season.
Chelsea have endured a turbulent pre-season with Sarri replacing fellow Italian Antonio Conte less than a month before the campaign got underway.
The Londoners also smashed their transfer record and set a new world-record fee for a goalkeeper in splashing 80 million euros (72 million, $92 million) on Kepa Arrizbalaga this week after Thibaut Courtois departed for Real Madrid.
The situation until now has been very difficult. On Monday four players from the World Cup arrived and then on Tuesday another two, so it's not been easy for me at the moment, said Sarri, who believes it will take two months for his side to be at their best.
But Kepa was rarely troubled in recording a clean sheet as the visitors greater quality told at the John Smith's Stadium after a slow start. The game was more difficult than the result. If you see the result you think it was a very easy match but in the first half it was very difficult against physical opponents, said Sarri. Crucially Chelsea have held onto Eden Hazard, but while the Belgian was only deemed fit enough for a place on the bench following his World Cup exertions, N'Golo Kante was thrown straight into the side after starring in Russia for world champions France.
Kante has been deployed in a more advanced role due to Jorginho's arrival and was on the end of Willian's cross to open the scoring 11 minutes before half-time.
Moments later Marcos Alonso was upended inside the area and Jorginho cheekily slotted home after a hop in his run up wrong-footed Ben Hamer.
Hazard was introduced for the final 15 minutes and looked keen to make up for lost time as he teed up Pedro Rodriguez to round off the scoring.
POCHETTINO PLEADS FOR UNITY
Tottenham have had a much quieter summer after becoming the first Premier League side since the transfer window was introduced in 2003 to not make a single signing.
But manager Mauricio Pochettino has insisted he is happy just to have retained a host of players who excelled at the World Cup and it was two of them who handed Spurs all three points at Newcastle.
Vertonghen and Alli struck either side of Joselu's equaliser for the Magpies with all three goals coming in the first 18 minutes.
It is important to be strong from the beginning and have belief and convey a positive message, Pochettino said.
It is important the fans know the players need their help.
PROMOTED SIDES STRUGGLE
At Molineux, Richarlison quietened criticism of Everton's splurge to reunite him with former Watford boss Marco Silva as the Brazilian twice put Everton in front.
The visitors were reduced to 10 men five minutes before half-time when Phil Jagielka was shown a straight red card and Ruben Neves and Raul Jimenez hit back to salvage a point for the hosts.
Like Wolves, Fulham earned rave reviews for their summer business, outspending United and City, in signing 12 new players.
But there was no instant return on that investment as Jeffrey Schlupp and Wilfried Zaha scored either side of half-time to give Palace a 2-0 win at Craven Cottage. Roberto Pereyra scored twice as Watford were too good for Brighton.
Bournemouth were also comfortable victors over promoted Cardiff thanks to goals from Ryan Fraser and Callum Wilson. - AFP

Chemanex posts Rs 108mn PBT
Chemanex PLC, the leading importer and manufacturer of industrial chemicals and intermediates, recently saw the completion of a successful restructuring process. The company, with its assets reaching Rs. 2.03 billion, has consolidated its strengths holistically and is all set to meet future challenges with sheer confidence.
Despite the decline of group turnover from last years Rs. 181 million to this years Rs.108 million, the profit before tax (PBT) reflected a significant improvement recording Rs.41 million this year in comparison to Rs.8 million the previous year.
This undoubtedly signifies the companys optimistic changes indicating focused business lines and slimmer organization. Furthermore, Chemanex was able to drop its administration expenses from Rs.31 million to Rs.12 million, whereas its distribution expenses dropped from Rs.14 million to Rs.3 million.
With an insightful approach to overcome impending obstacles, Chemanex steered its prudent restructuring process observing a number of crucial changes. The company took steps to clearly identify and terminate non-profitable or lagging operations, while fostering core competencies. It also introduced an actionable business model built on improved focus, structure and efficiency, which in turn encouraged a sustainable growth and enhanced stakeholder value.
Furthermore, by disposing unutilized lands, Chemanex was able to achieve significant funds to complement its short term investments. The company is hopeful that the steps taken will help them garner higher profits through strategic operations in due course.
Expressing his views on the matter, P.R. Saldin, Chairman of Chemanex PLC said, With the successful completion of our restructuring process, we are more optimistic to face future challenges than ever before. Our next step is to leverage effective synergies with the CIC Group and incorporate their expertise to develop and expand our market strengths and presence. This approach will help us meet the rising demands of our local and international markets while providing them with full product requirements.

Pride of place for all Sri Lankans
The Citizens Movement for Good Governance (CIMOGG) strongly endorses the untiring Bernard Fernandos plea in his recent letter titled Dispense with ad hoc ratios and bonus seats for PC Elections where he urges that we should do away with efforts to keep alive the idea of classifying some groups as minorities. All citizens should be called Sri Lankans.
Accordingly, the Constitution of Sri Lanka should be for all Sri Lankans without differential treatment for ethnicity, language, religion and so on. This would be the only reliable way of uniting the country and concentrating thereafter on improving the efficiency of the legislative, administrative and judicial arms of the State, and thereby encourage the people to work towards developing the economy, social services, productivity and all those ancillary matters that would help us to catch up on some of the valuable decades of time that we have lost.

Crossings push daily turnover to 10-week high
The Bourse ended the week on a negative note as the ASPI decreased by 2.35 points (or -0.04%) to close at 6,141.55 points, while the S&P SL20 Index also decreased by 5.78 points (or -0.17%) to close at 3,316.47 points.
Turnover and market capitalization 
JKH was the highest contributor to the weeks turnover value, contributing LKR 1.50Bn or 35.04% of total turnover value. Ceylinco Insurance followed suit, accounting for 29.98% of turnover (value of LKR 1.28Bn) while Sampath Bank contributed LKR 0.25Bn to account for 5.92% of the weeks turnover.
Total turnover value amounted to LKR 4.28Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR 1.45Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR 0.86Bn (+194.23% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 0.29Bn.
Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased by 0.04% W-o-W (or LKR 1.10Bn) to LKR 2,875.91Bn cf. LKR 2,877.01Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms) 
The Banks, Finance & Insurance sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 43.66% (or LKR 1.87Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by Ceylinco Insurance, Sampath Bank & Commercial Bank which accounted for 88.29% of the sectors total turnover.
The Diversified sector meanwhile accounted for 37.37% (or LKR 1.60Bn) of the total turnover value, with turnover driven primarily by JKH & Melstacorp which accounted for 96.80% of the sector turnover. The Beverage, Food & Tobacco sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 12.05% (or LKR 0.52bn) to the market driven by Cold Stores, Ceylon Tobacco, LMF & Lion Brewery which accounted for 91.93% of the sector turnover.
Liquidity (in Volume Terms) 
The Banks, Finance & Insurance sector dominated the market in terms of share volume, accounting for 28.91% (or 20.13mn shares) of total volume, with a value contribution of LKR 1.87bn.
The Diversified sector followed suit, adding 26.52% to total turnover volume as 18.46mn shares were exchanged. 
The sectors volume accounted for LKR 1.60bn of total market turnover value. The Trading sector meanwhile, contributed 7.22mn shares (or 10.37%), amounting to LKR 0.01bn.
Top gainers and losers 
Singer Industries was the weeks highest price gainer; increasing 20.4% W-o-W from LKR137.00 to LKR165.00 while Paragon (+17.6% W-o-W), Brac Lanka Finance (+15.1% W-o-W) and Ceylon Investment (+14.3% W-o-W) were also amongst the top gainers.
Huejay was the weeks highest price loser; declining 23.7% W-o-W to close at LKR24.10 while Tess Agro (-16.7% W-o-W), Blue diamonds (-16.7% W-o-W) and Tokyo Cement [NV] (-15.9% W-o-W) were also amongst the top losers over the week.
Foreign investors closed the week in a net selling position with total net outflow amounting to LKR 0.17bn relative to last weeks total net outflow of LKR 0.08Bn (-109.32% W-o-W). Total foreign purchases increased by 484.97% W-o-W to LKR 2.24bn from last weeks value of LKR 0.38bn, while total foreign sales amounted to LKR 2.41bn relative to LKR 0.47bn recorded last week (+418.45% W-o-W).
In terms of volume Melstacorp & Chevron led foreign purchases while JKH & Dialog Axiata led foreign sales. In terms of value Ceylinco Insurance & Cold Stores led foreign purchases while JKH & Commercial Bank led foreign sales.
Point of view 
Bargain hunting on Sri Lankas key blue-chip JKH pushed daily market turnover to a high since May (Rs.2.3bn), pushing average daily turnover levels to 10-week highs amid large crossings in the battered blue-chip. Due to generally sluggish market conditions and weaker corporate earnings, JKH had wiped off ~8% of its value YTD (Rs.138 cf. Rs.150 in Jan18) by last week, prompting large block purchases by local HNI and Institutionals as Foreign investors sold down ~0.49% (6Mn shares) of their ownership in JKH.
JKH consequently accounted for 45% of the weeks total crossings of Rs.2bn (24% of the markets total turnover) while large blocks in Ceylinco Insurance (48% of the weeks total crossings and 25% of total market turnover) also helped revive the weeks average daily market turnover to Rs.0.85bn (avg. daily turnover has ranged between Rs.0.28bn-Rs.0.74bn since June18).
The revived market activity in JKH helped its price (which hit a one year low on Tuesday to register a 9% loss YTD) recover 6% over the remainder of the week, and the stock consequently closed up at Rs. 144.9 helping wipe off some of the losses made during the year.
The YTD loss on JKH by the end of this week consequently reduced to 3.4% cf. YTD loss of 8% last week. The Index-heavy weights price recovery also helped the benchmark ASPI offset some of its losses from earlier in the week, and the broad-share Index consequently ended the week on a flat note (-0.04% W-o-W).
Meanwhile, ~27% of corporates have reported June quarter results so far, with 56% of the companies who have reported earnings recording Y-o-Y gains in quarterly earnings.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to continue looking for cues from the June quarter corporate earnings releases.
Pace of industrial production slows in Q218
Sri Lankas Industrial Production (IP) in the manufacturing sector in Q218 rose a marginal 0.6% Y-o-Y, as manufactured volumes of Coke and refined petroleum products (15.0%) and Chemicals (8.5%) rose over the period.
Productions volumes of Wood products (10.5%), fabricated Metal products (9.5%), Beverages (5.3%), and Basic Metals (4.2%) also rose over the quarter but showed declines in the pace of growth compared to Q118.
The IP index is a leading economic indicator representing production volumes in the Industrial sector for a given period of time and can be used to identify the turning points in economic development at an early stage.
Thus, while the 0.6% Y-o-Y growth in the overall index in Q218 is positive, the fact that industrial production has slowed compared to Q118 (when the Index rose 1.6%) indicates a slowing pace of growth over Q218. Indeed, on a Q-o-Q basis between Q1 and Q2 2018, the Index has declined 4.6% relative to a 3.7% decline in the comparable period last year. In line with this, the CBSL Governor last week downgraded the CBSLs full year GDP growth forecast for Sri Lanka down to 4% from its earlier forecast of 4.5%.
At its latest monetary policy review last week, the CBSL cautioned that the downside risks to global economic growth remains high due to monetary policy tightening in advanced economies, strengthening of the USD and escalating trade tensions.
The CBSL added that these developments have added pressure on many emerging market currencies, prompting some of these EMs to respond to these risks by tightening their monetary policies and allowing their exchange rates to adjust appropriately.
The Bank added that while some pressure on the LKR was evident since late April 2018, some of this depreciation pressure on the LKR has eased since late July 2018.

South Africa wins ODI series 3-2
Destructive Dananjaya subjects Proteas to third worst defeat
Akila Dananjaya produced one of his most destructive spells of spin bowling taking a career best six wickets for 29 runs to rout South Africa for 121 and give Sri Lanka an overwhelming win by 178 runs in the fifth and final ODI played under lights at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
South Africa won the five-match series 3-2 after taking a 3-0 lead by winning the first three matches. However Sri Lanka came back strongly in the last two matches to secure back to back victories by winning the fourth and fifth ODIs.
Yesterdays win came on the back of a captains knock of 97 not out scored at a run a ball from Angelo Mathews, an innings that provided the bedrock for their total of 299-8 after choosing to bat first.
South Africa were pushed onto the back foot right from the very first over when Suranga Lakmal castled Hashim Amla for a duck with the fourth ball of the innings.
Captain Angelo Mathews drives during his innings of 97 not out in the fifth and final ODI against South Africa at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday. AFP
From there onwards it was a struggle for the Proteas to chase down Sri Lankas challenging total on a pitch that had begun to get slow and offer some turn. Dananjaya struck in his third over by having Aiden Markram caught and bowled for 20 and continued to weave a web around the rest of the batsmen adding the wickets of Reeza Hendricks (0) and Henry Klaasen (3) before coming off from his first spell of five overs with figures of 3 for 20.
He returned for his second spell in the 18th over with South Africa struggling at 93-6 to complete the rout taking a further 3 wickets for 9 runs off four overs to subject the opponents to their third worst defeat in history (by runs).
They lost by 182 runs to Pakistan at Port Elizabeth in 2002 and by 180 runs to Sri Lanka at the R Premadasa Stadium in 2013.
Dananjayas figures is the second best by a bowler in ODIs against South Africa after West Indian spinner Sunil Naraines 6/27 at Providence in 2016 and the second best at this venue after Angelo Mathews 6 for 20 against India in 2009.
Quinton de Kock leading South Africa in the last two ODIs of the series in the absence of injured skipper Faf du Plessis who has returned home, was the only South African batsman to offer any kind of resistance against the rampaging Dananjaya.
De Kock stuck it out for 57 balls to make a top score of 54 (7 fours) before he finally became a victim of Dananjayas mastery failing to pick his googly and being castled. The rest of the batting had hardly anything to offer as Kumara, Lakmal and Dhananjaya de Silva also chipped in with wickets.
Sri Lankas total of 299-8 comprised four 50-plus partnerships  two of them involving Mathews who batted right to the end to remain not out on 97 with the aid of 11 fours and a six. He was unfortunate to miss out on a hundred when the overs ran out. It was the fourth occasion that he has been either stranded or dismissed in the nineties.
Openers Dickwella and Tharanga posted exactly 50 off 51 balls and following Tharangas dismissal for 19, Dickwella formed a liaison of 50 with Kusal Mendis (38) for the third wicket.
Further stands of 53 for the fifth wicket and 52 for the sixth followed between Mathews and Dhananjaya de Silva (30) and Mathews and Thisara Perera (13) that boosted Sri Lankas total near the 300-run mark.
It was a solid display of batting by the Lankans something that had been lacking in their arsenal for quite awhile. It seems as if the team decision to prepare good batting wickets for ODIs from the third match of the series has started to pay dividends with Sri Lanka posting totals of 285, 306-7 and 299-8.
The win coincided with the R Premadasa Stadium hosting its 100th day-night game, the fourth to do so overall after Sydney (149), Sharjah (112) and Melbourne (105).
South Africas Jean-Paul Duminy took the Player of the Series award, while Dananjaya won the Man of the Match.
The two teams will meet at the same venue on Tuesday for a one-off T20I which will conclude South Africas six-week tour of Sri Lanka.

## Supertitle: MEN are more successful than women at losing weight

MEN are more successful than women at losing weight
Dieting gender divide
Dieting is more successful for men than women, researchers have found.
Men on a crash diet lose more weight and their health benefits more as a result, they discovered.
Doctors tracked 2,200 overweight men and women, who they placed on an eight-week calorie-controlled diet.
The men on the study lost 16 per cent more weight than women, the scientists reported.
But when they took the different weight-loss into account they found men's health benefited more from the weight loss.
Their fat levels dropped more, their heart rate improved and their metabolic syndrome score - a marker of diabetes risk - also reduced more than it did among women. The research team - which included scientists from the universities of Nottingham, Copenhagen and Helsinki - believe this is because men tend to accumulate weight around the belly, which is easier to put on and also easier to lose.
Women tend to put it on their hips, thighs and face.
But the belly fat - known as 'intra-abdominal fat' - is also more dangerous, wrapping around the body's crucial organs, so the health benefits of losing this are greater.
The scientists, writing in the Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism medical journal, said: 'Men mobilise more intra-abdominal fat than women during weight loss, and that this is accompanied by a more pronounced improvement in the metabolic risk profile. 'We found important differences when comparing outcomes between women and men, both before and after adjusting for differences in weight loss.
'This suggests intrinsic differences in how men and women adapt to dietary energy deficits.'
Lead author Dr Pia Christensen, of the University of Copenhagen, said: 'Despite adjusting for the differences in weight loss, it appears that men benefitted more from the intervention than women.
'Whether differences between genders persist in the long-term and whether we will need to design different interventions depending on gender will be interesting to follow.'
The team found men lost an average of 1st 12lb (11.8kg), compared to 1st 8lb (10.2kg) for women.
But they said men could have lost even more - because despite finding it easier to lose weight they were less likely to stick to the diet.
They wrote: 'Women were closer to their theoretically achievable weight loss target (82.2 per cent) than men (64.5 per cent).
'This suggests that women were more compliant with the diet than men.' Men are far more reluctant to do anything about their weight, despite finding it easier to actually shed the pounds.
Men make up only 23 per cent of participants in NHS weight loss programmes.Experts say women have been under pressure for decades to diet and slim in pursuit of a perfect body - but experts believe men view obesity as acceptable normality.
A study by the Men's Health Forum published last year suggested overweight men tend to be deluded about how fat they are.
More than half of overweight men think their weight is 'about right', their report said.
It found British men are 17 per cent more likely to be overweight and 26 per cent more likely to have type two diabetes than women.
Yet 55 per cent of overweight men thought their weight was 'about right', compared to 31 per cent of overweight women.
Professor Naveed Sattar, an expert in metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, said men need to be more attentive to their weight than women because they are more at risk from heart disease and diabetes.

Dinosaurs liked perfumes that we enjoy today
The compounds behind the pleasant fragrance of the perfumes and colognes have been prompting olfactory sensors since the age of dinosaurs, a new research reveals.
According to the research performed at Oregon State University by George Poinar Jr. and his son, the floral fragrances originated as pollinator attractants in ancient flowers that date back to 100 million years ago, precisely the time when dinosaurs walked on Earth.
I bet some of the dinosaurs could have detected the scents of these early flowers. In fact, floral essences from these early flowers could even have attracted these giant reptiles, said George Poinar.
The research shows that the flower-based compounds, being used for perfumes and colognes in the present time, have been providing olfactory excitement to pollinating insects and other animals since the mid-Cretaceous Period.
In the absence of colorful petals, flowers from that period relied only on scents to attract pollinators. The floral tissues producing these scents include nectaries, glandular trichomes, eliaphores and osmophores.
You cant detect scents or analyze the chemical components of fossil flowers, but you can find the tissues responsible for the scents, said Poinar.
The study also found some tissues of certain type of flowers to be similar in structure to those of their modern progeny, which suggests that a similar essence is produced by modern and ancient flowers of the same lineages. ANI

He said that the hotel on a two acre land now offers 52 sea view deluxe rooms and three suites. It also has a Spa managed by the hotel, swimming pool with a kiddies pool, gym, large garden area and outdoor sports facilities. We also provide facilities for water sports in the sea which has a large reef.
The hotel since its re opening last year has being maintaining good occupancy averaging around 60% and hope to end 2018 winter with around 85% occupancy. We have a 70 staff and they received a highest service charge per months of Rs. 55, 000 in one month. We have a very good mixed clientele with European and Gulf and the Indian market being dominating players. We also have a year around 25%local guests which patronize the hotel.
De Soysa who is a hotel school graduate with over 20 years experience in the trade said that since its refurbishment they also have increased online bookings.The hotel also offers special day out corporate packages which too is gaining in popularity. Manager Sales and Marketing, Manoj Fernando said that since there are many star class hotels they are adopting novel marketing concepts which are very productive. The Earls Courts Management is on a mega hotel building spree and their first City hotel Earls Red was opened in Dematagoda with a Rs 350 million investment.
In addition the group also owns and operates Black Pepper Restaurant at Dutch Hotel and have a 23 key City Hotel in Kandy. The group also have taken Hill Top Kandy and would open it next year along with new purposely built hotels in Kurunegala ( 50 rooms in the first stage) and Negombo ( 90 rooms) early next year.
The management has also invested over Rs 800 million for a luxury hotel project in Oman which too would be opened in February.

Embrace your green thumb!
Did you know that getting your hands dirty can help your bill of health stay clean This National Gardening Week, were exploring the health benefits of gardening for seniors and how this hobby can enhance your life. Here are five physical and emotional ways that embracing your green thumb is good for you:
1. Encourages physical movement
Perhaps without even knowing it, you perform a host of healthy exercises in a single gardening session, including squatting, lifting, and pushing. In fact, a study conducted by the American Society for Horticultural Science found that just 30 minutes of gardening fulfills all physical activity recommendations for seniors. Thanks to the wide variety of movements, gardening is a healthy form of both aerobic and strength-building exercise. While gardening, be careful not to go beyond any exercise limits you have discussed with your doctor. If bending over or kneeling on the ground isnt for you, consider a raised garden instead.
2. Provides a natural source of vitamin D
Vitamin D, the sunshine vitamin, has several health benefits for the body, particularly for metabolic functions and skeletal health. Spending time in the sun when gardening allows your body to synthesize this healthy nutrient naturally. However, use caution when exposing yourself to the sun. Protect yourself from burns and dehydration with plenty of high-quality sunscreen on any exposed skin, a wide-brimmed hat, and fluids to stay hydrated.
3. Reduces stress and boosts your mood
The positive emotional health benefits of gardening are well-documented. An analysis of twenty-two different studies uncover a link between gardening and reduced anxiety and depression. It also decreases levels of cortisol, the stress hormone. And while sunlight and exercise are certainly a factor in this, theres another fascinating reason involved. Soil itself appears to contain bacteria that acts as an antidepressant! Exposure to that bacteria through contact with the soil and consuming your home-grown produce can elevate your mood and make you feel good.
4. Offers new social opportunities
Nurturing social relationships is shown to have significant effects on mental and physical health. Research shows that adults who socialize enjoy better health and live longer than their isolated peers. Where better to build relationships than in the garden Community gardens provide a common purpose, a space for meeting and interacting with old and new friends, and the satisfaction of beautifying your neighborhood and growing nutritious food together.
5. Keeps your mind sharp
Experts found that daily gardening can lower the risk of dementia by up to 36%. From problem-solving to sensory awareness, spending time with your hands in the earth involves many cognitive functions that can keep your brain sharp.

England rout India by an innings and 159 runs in 2nd Test
London, Sunday: England thrashed India by an innings and 159 runs to win the second Test at Lords on Sunday with visiting skipper Virat Kohli admitting: We deserved to lose.
Victory, achieved on the fourth day of a rain-marred match featuring a total first-day washout, put England 2-0 up in this five-match series.
I am not very proud of the way we played, said Kohli. England deserved to win; we deserved to lose.
India slumped to 130 all out in their second innings, with James Anderson taking his 100th Test wicket at Lords en route to four for 23, with Stuart Broads four for 44 featuring two wickets in two balls.
But, appropriately, Chris Woakes ended the match when he had Ishant Sharma caught at leg-slip by debutant Ollie Pope.
Woakes, recalled in place of Ben Stokes after his fellow all-rounder was omitted because of an ongoing trial for affray, made 137 not out -- his maiden Test century -- in Englands first-innings 396 for seven declared.
His stand of 189 with Jonny Bairstow, an England record for the sixth-wicket against India, helped the hosts recover after they had slumped to 89 for four.
Anderson took five for 20 in swing-friendly conditions as India collapsed to 107 all out in their first innings.
India batted for just 82.2 overs in the entire match, with Englands lone innings occupying 88.1 overs.
The third Test at Trent Bridge starts on Saturday, with India now looking to become only the second team in history to win a five-Test series from 2-0 down after a Don Bradman-inspired Australia achieved the feat against England back in 1936/37. AFP

Fiery novelist and Nobel Laureate V.S. Naipaul dead
UK: British author V.S. Naipaul, a famously outspoken Nobel laureate who wrote on the traumas of post-colonial change, has died at the age of 85.
Naipaul, who was born in Trinidad and the son of an Indian civil servant, was best known for works including A House for Mr Biswas and his Man Booker Prize-winning In A Free State.
He died surrounded by those he loved having lived a life which was full of wonderful creativity and endeavour, his wife Lady Nadira Naipaul said in a statement on Saturday. She described the outspoken author as a giant in all that he achieved.
Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul settled in England and studied English literature at Oxford University on a scholarship.
But he spent much of his time travelling and despite becoming a pillar of Britains cultural establishment, was also a symbol of modern rootlessness.
Naipauls early works focused on the West Indies, but came to encompass countries around the world.
He stirred controversy in the past, describing post-colonial countries as half-made societies and arguing that Islam both enslaved and attempted to wipe out other cultures.
When he was awarded the 2001 Nobel prize for literature, the Swedish Academy described him as a literary circumnavigator, only ever really at home in himself, in his inimitable voice.
It said he was the annalist of the destinies of empires in the moral sense: what they do to human beings.
His authority as a narrator is grounded in his memory of what others have forgotten, the history of the vanquished, it said.
Naipaul, who was knighted in 1990, mixed fiction, non-fiction and autobiography without distinction.
One of his seminal novels was the A House for Mr Biswas (1961), which looked at the almost impossible task for Indian immigrants in the Caribbean of trying to integrate into society while keeping hold of their roots. Overall he wrote more than 30 books, and was one of the first winners of the Booker Prize, now Britains leading literary award, in 1971 for In A Free State.
During his early career Naipaul was dogged by money worries and loneliness. He met his first wife, Pat, at Oxford, who became his constant literary support.
She died in 1996, and he later revealed that he felt he hastened her death by publicly admitting, while she fought cancer, that he had frequented prostitutes.
The admission consumed her. I think she had all the relapses and everything after that... It could be said that I had killed her, Naipaul said in a tell-all biography by British author Patrick French, The World Is What It Is: The Authorized Biography Of V.S. Naipaul.
He had a quarter-century, sometimes violent, affair with an Argentinian, and he married Pakistani journalist Nadira Alvi the same year Pat died.
He was famously outspoken and had a reputation for cutting people out of his life, and once retorted: My life is short. I cant listen to banalities. The objects of Naipauls ire ranged from corruption in Indian politics to the Wests cynical treatment of its former colonies to the cult of personality in The Return of Eva Peron.
He likened former British prime minister Tony Blair to a pirate at the head of a socialist revolution, and was also disparaging about sentimental female novelists.
Women writers are different, they are quite different. I read a piece of writing and within a paragraph or two I know whether it is by a woman or not. I think (it is) unequal to me, he told the London Evening Standard newspaper in 2011.
He said this was due to womens sentimentality, the narrow view of the world.
Naipaul also fell out with US travel writer Paul Theroux, who later wrote a bitter, no-holds-barred memoir of their long association. They later resolved their differences. - AFP

## Title: Future of Trincomalee
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial
## Date: Monday, August 13, 2018 - 01:00
Future of Trincomalee
Trincomalee, or Trinco as it is often called by locals, is one city that exemplifies Sri Lankas linguistic and cultural diversity. It is a picturesque city where Sri Lankas three main communities live together in harmony in almost equal numbers. It is also known as a tourist hotspot, with such iconic attractions as Fort Frederick (completed in 1624), Swami Rock, Koneswaram Temple, Lovers Leap, Pigeon Island and of course, the crystal clear blue ocean. The Eastern city is also known for its free-roaming herds of deer which are completely at ease among humans.
Trincomalee suffered immensely during the 30-year old conflict that severely impeded its socio-economic development. Even though it was under Government control and was less affected than neighbouring Batticaloa and the Northern cities, Trincomalee and surrounding areas were caught up in the general drift of the conflict. Both local and foreign tourists stayed away, industry and agriculture faded and infrastructure facilities were adversely affected. The one silver lining was that the residents of Trincomalee never lost their sense of amity and togetherness even at the height of the conflict.
After the war ended nearly 10 years ago, Trincomalee lost no time in getting its vibe back. It has now regained its rightful place as the best city in the Eastern Province. Tourism is again prospering  the city is consistently ranked as one of the best places to visit in Sri Lanka by foreign magazines and newspapers. The resourceful people of Trincomalee are working hard to make their city an even better place to live in. Now the Government has stepped in with a comprehensive plan, having realized the great potential of Trincomalee for the future.
By 2050, Trincomalee is envisioned to become the largest city in Eastern Sri Lanka, serving as a magnet for Northern, Eastern, and Central Provinces as an employment, education, healthcare, tourism, and energy hub. Its population is projected to be 1.24 million occupying 300 square kilometres of land.
In fact, Trincomalee will become Sri Lankas Eastern Gateway and will be remodelled as a hub for tourism, exports and logistics under a master plan for the district done by Singapores urban planning firm Surbana Jurong Consultants Pte Ltd. The master plan, done for the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, adopts an integrated B.L.U.E. (Biodiversity, Liveability, Uniqueness, Economy) urbanism planning approach. This approach could indeed be followed by other cities around the island.
The acronym communicates four clear goals shaping the master planning framework to protect the regions biodiversity, enhance its liveability while retaining its uniqueness and strengthening the economy of Trincomalee. The plan is a comprehensive one that seamlessly integrates the strategies and proposals from three key aspects related to urban development, namely Land Use, Transport and Infrastructure. The land use aspect covers environmentally sensitive areas and land set aside to meet all projected economic, residential, amenities and recreational needs.
Aligning with the Governments plan of drastically increasing exports, Trincomalee would become the Eastern Export Hub by creating a clean industrial ecosystem that can add value to the rich agriculture, aquaculture and mineral resources available in its hinterland in the Eastern, North-Central, and Northern Provinces.
Trincomalee already has one of the worlds most renowned natural harbours  developing it up to international standards will not be difficult. Several friendly countries have already indicated an interest in developing this port. Naturally, Trincomalee would also be repositioned as an Eastern Tourism Hub with increased regional connectivity, realized through the Colombo - Trincomalee Economic Corridor development and the proposed Hingurakgoda International Airport, around 90 Km away or one hour on the proposed high speed road network. A number of international airlines may wish to fly directly to Hingurakgoda given its proximity to Trincomalee. There will also be more opportunities for domestic operators to connect BIA/ Ratmalana with Trincomalee using bigger planes. The plan also recognizes Trincomalee as the Eastern Logistics Hub. This will apparently be done by attracting its share from growing maritime trade in the Bay of Bengal as well as gains from economic opportunities resulting from proposed Free Trade Agreements with South Asian and South East Asian countries.
However, all these efforts would come to naught if the residents needs are not adequately addressed. Hence, the detailed land use plan would ensure that enough land is set aside to efficiently serve live-work-play needs of future residents while the zoning plan would guide urban development in a sustainable manner. Urban design guidelines would shape unique and memorable public spaces.
The development plan for Trincomalee District will also open up growth opportunities for the eastern and northern parts of Sri Lanka in order to contribute to the holistic development of the island. Indeed, this will be a very comprehensive plan for development and social progress that could be applied to the other provinces depending on its success. Attention should also be focused on developing Batticaloa, other Eastern cities and tourism sites such as Arugam Bay under this plan. The proposed B.L.U.E. holistic approach to development must be more widely adopted to accelerate overall development with a human touch.

Garden in a bottle
Home Gardening could save the planet! Home Gardening is about loving the planet. Green Thumbs speaks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Office Ratmalana, District Agriculture Instructor K.N.K. Jayathilake on structures in home Gardening.
The plastic bottles you use are unhealthy for the environment because of the inability of plastic to biodegrade. Plastic waste ends up in landfills (also known as rubbish dumps or garbage dumps) or waterways. It has a devastating impact on sea life. Over 1 trillion plastic bags are used every year worldwide and a single plastic bag can take up to 1,000 years to degrade.
Every square mile of ocean has about 46,000 pieces of plastic floating in it. Researchers have discovered that plastic waste deceives fish by giving off an odor similar to that of their food. And that is what is killing them. And in turn we eat those same fish. A lot of people eat seafood and those fish have eaten plastic. It is also estimated that people who eat shellfish can consume up to 11,000 pieces of micro-plastic a year. The toxic chemicals are highly dangerous to our health and the health of sea life.
The dengue threat is also there in plastic. In these rubbish dumps the water that accumulates can be host to the dengue mosquitos eggs. Plastic waste helps dengue mosquito breed.
The number of households in Sri Lanka in 2021 is forecasted to reach approximately 5.1 million, compared to five million in 2016. Just imagine if those households could use those plastic bottles without discarding them It would make a huge difference in the world! It would help protect sea life and it would help with the dengue epidemics.
This is where home gardening comes into the equation. Plastic bottles can be used for planting in home gardens. They are called Cultivation bottles. Heres how Make several inverted T shaped cuts in the bottle. Fill the bottle with the soil mixture and make a small water seepage hole in the bottom of the bottle. This is one method. Another method is to keep the bottle in the horizontal axis, remove a section from its body, make seepage holes in the bottom side and fill the bottle with the soil mixture.
In the plastic bottles, suitable crops for cultivation are leafy vegetables such as Mukunuwenna, Kan- Kun and Gotukola. Also flowering plants such as Japanese Rose and Petunia can be grown in cultivation bottles. It is easy to maintain these cultivation bottles. Water is required and quick growth can be expected. The bottles must be positioned in spaces with adequate sunlight, said Jayathilake
These Cultivation bottles can be easily bought from the supermarkets and used as structures. If at least a million households in Sri Lanka can use these plastic bottles in their home gardens this could change this country. Who knows Maybe the entire world can be inspired by our little island. The entire world could learn a lesson from us.
Cultivation Tat is another structure that can help in Home Gardening. It is particularly suitable for urban dwellers residing in apartments. The materials you need are PVC gutters and end caps, Nylon String, soil mixture (top soil, compost and coir dust) and rooted healthy seedlings.
The method is  Prepare around three PVC gutters and cover the ends using end caps. Then you need to make two seepage holes in the bottom of every piece of gutter and hang those gutters vertically with the Nylon strings. Then just fill the gutters with the soil mixture.
When you take the Cultivation Tat, the suitable crops for cultivation would include leafy vegetables such as lettuce, Gotukola, Kan-Kun and Mukunuwenna. Like the plastic bottles this two is relatively easy to maintain. It must be cultivated in a space of abundant sunlight and water is needed. There is no need to administer any pesticide. The Cultivation Tat is excellent for vertical spaces making maximum use of the spaces in and around the house, explained Jayathilake
Both Cultivation Tat and Bottle are very manageable. You just need to pick up the bottle and take it where you want to take it to, and hang the cultivation tat wherever it pleases you. You will be able to enjoy your abode in numerous ways.
Cultivation pots/ containers maybe a little heavier than the Cultivation Bottle and Tat but nevertheless ideal to grow some vegetables. They might be a little more expensive to buy than the bottle but you will find it very useful. It too is portable and easy in maintaining.
Containers suitable for cultivation are plastic containers, cement containers, polythene and poly sack containers, plastic barrels and discarded containers. When using plastic or cement containers for vegetable cultivation one must be conscious of its dimensions, depth and diameter. In order to cultivate crops such as Chili, tomato, cabbage, radish and leafy vegetables, choose containers of around 25cm in depth. When planting species such as eggplant, choose larger containers of around 45cm in depth. The reason behind this is the large spread of the root system of the species, added Jayathilake.
Apartment dwellers tend to cultivate fruit crops such as star fruit, orange, lime and mandarin in containers. For this its more suitable to use plastic barrels 1  feet in diameter and 1  feet deep for such plants.
If you take polythene or poly-sack containers they are most suitable for the cultivation of vegetable and leafy vegetable species. The dimensions of the container may differ according to the species planted in it. Generally a 1 foot tall container with a 1 foot diameter are used. Poly-sack containers of 5kg, 10kg and 25kg are also ideal as cultivation containers, he said.
As with Cultivation bottles and Cultivation Tat, sunlight is the key element. Also it needs to be watered every day. Again one can use plastic bottles to water the containers.
Fill the plastic bottle with water and close the lid. Then make a hole in the lid and bury a portion of the bottle, lid downwards in the container. This ensures a water supply for the plant for a few days, he said.

Generation Z: We have more to do than drink and take drugs
They drink less, take far fewer drugs, and have made teenage pregnancy a near anomaly. Generation Z  one of several terms used to describe post-millennial youth born after 1996  prefer juice bars to pub crawls, rank quality family time ahead of sex and prioritise good grades before friendship, at least according to a report published by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service last week.
An onslaught of sneering headlines followed, characterising todays youth as boring, sensible and hopelessly screen-addicted.
So, are the kids all right
We have so much more to do than [just] drink and take drugs, says Demi Babalola, a 19-year-old philosophy and sociology student. Im not surprised those [statistics] show thats the case: it makes sense. We have a lot more to distract us now.
Older people
Whats her biggest time stealer Social media. Babalola toggles between Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram, although she rolls her eyes at the mention of Facebook, full as it is of older people.
But its not just the breadth of entertainment and culture that is so instantly available  and disposable  to Babalola and her peers. There is also a growing feeling that the preoccupations of her parents generation seem, well, a bit lame.
Going out takes a lot of effort: its boring, repetitive and expensive, she says. Obviously, I used to go out a lot in my first year [at university], but now we do more kickbacks.
To the uninitiated, a kickback is the sophisticated Gen Z sweet spot between the lairy house parties of yore  the ones typified by vomit on the parental carpet and a trashing of the family bathroom  and a pre-teen sleepover.
We hang out, we listen to music, make our own food, and play games, she says. Well probably organise it a couple of days before.
Video games
Lewis Allely, 14, from Cornwall, agrees. Were quite different [from your generation] because theres more stuff to do at each others houses and we have more technology  like, we have video games.
His teacher, Mr Worthington, laughs. I gave them a free lesson the other day where they could do what they wanted. He knew a mass bunk- off to the park or similar would be off the cards. I came back after an hour and they were all sitting in a circle, looking down at their phones and chatting.
The cliche that many young people spend far too much time online, instead of indulging in a romanticised form of rebellion, may have some truth, but as futurologist Rhiannon McGregor points out, Gen Z-ers are more cautious and risk-averse than their parents, partly because that technology exists.
Theyre aware from an early age of how theyre portrayed online and offline, so they curate themselves in a more conservative way, she says. (In other words, no one wants to be publicly shamed getting messy or being recklessly daft.)
But theyre also more socially aware and see themselves as part of a global community.
Its easier to get and feel connected to someone in Africa or Asia and share concerns about climate change, for instance. Clara Finnigan, 22, who grew up in Devon and is in her final year at the University of Arts London, points out that one size doesnt fit all. She still goes out, often to gay clubs.
Political state
She believes her generation is unfairly judged and that it reports levels of stress and depression that are higher than ever because of the economic and political state of the world it has inherited.
The whole anxiety of not having stability in your future is something that is definitely very present. I wont probably ever own my own house, unless I get really lucky.

Govt to draft new laws for  investor protection
Governments objective is to strengthen the Enterprise Sri Lanka  programme by encouraging the countrys own industrialists to enter the global market and foreign investors to commence business opportunities in Sri Lanka , Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said .
The Prime Minster was addressing the annual CNCI Achiever Awards 2018 ceremony, conducted by Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI). Over 500 local industrialists represented their respective manufacturing and service sectors at the event.
Through the `Enterprise Sri Lanka programme, the Prime Minister said the Government will draft new laws with the Ministry of Development and International Trade to give investors a guarantee to their businesses. This was needed to change the impression among most local and foreign industrialists that their industries will be nationalized any time.
Stressing the importance of establishing the Trade Adjustment Package, he said the Government with the help of all stakeholders in the industrial sector has a massive plan to develop the countrys economy to further heights.
The Trade Adjustment Package will encourage our small, medium and large industrialists and the Government will discuss with State banks, development banks and commercial banks to encourage industrialists.
The Premier said the Governments plan is to distribute Rs. 10 billion through the new Development Bank to stakeholders to develop their industries
The Premier also said the GSP Plus concession has given industrialists all the encouragements and the path to easily access leading countries in the world.
Although Sri Lankan exporters currently export only three to four verities we have to encourage them to export at least eight to nine categories to the European Market, he said.
Talking about the FTA with Singapore, the Premier said it will never show any harmful result to our country as the Government is monitoring the progress of it to ensure that it gives fruitful results.
He said FTA s will not harm locally manufactured products anyway as the Governments objective was to protect local industrialists when signing FTAs even in the future.
The Prime Minister also said to encourage industrialists the Government will grant assistance such as tax incentives which is over 100 per cent of the capital investment and industrialists in the North will get 200 per cent depreciation.
He also talked about the significant development of the tourism industry and said new hotels will be opened.
CNCI , Chairman Raja Hewabowala said the achievers awards ceremony encourages not only the industrialists and service sector personnel but also helps to swell the countrys economy.

Halep, Stephens into Montreal final
MONTREAL, Sunday - Sloane Stephens sent defending champion Elina Svitolina crashing out of the WTA Canada tournament in Montreal on Saturday to set up a rematch of the French Open final against Simona Halep.
American third seed Stephens surged into Sunday's final against world number one Halep after overpowering Svitolina 6-3, 6-3 in the day's second semi-final.
Stephens had dominated the first set, scoring two early breaks to race into a 4-0 lead against a hesitant Svitolina.
Svitolina rallied briefly to get back to 5-3 but then handed Stephens another break and the first set when she sent a forehand wide.
The second set was a similar story, with Stephens going 3-1 up after an early break.
The 25-year-old from Florida then overcame a wobble in the fifth game, double-faulting three times before eventually holding for a 4-1 lead and closing out the set.
US Open winner Stephens will go against Halep on Sunday, having only beaten the Romanian twice in their previous eight meetings.
Halep, who defeated Stephens in three sets at Roland Garros in June, earlier cruised past Australia's Ashleigh Barty 6-4, 6-1 to book her place in the final.
Halep was in control from the outset against a nervous-looking Barty, whose challenge was undone by a string of unforced errors.
Barty was in trouble on her opening service game, an error giving French Open champion Halep a break point which she duly converted with a superb backhand crosscourt winner.
The next three games went with serve to leave Halep 3-1 up and the 26-year-old then bagged her second break in the fifth game when another Barty error let Halep off the hook to take the game to deuce.
A sensational backhand winner down the line gave Halep a break point and when Barty limply returned into the net on the next exchange she found herself 4-1 down.
Barty grabbed a consolation break of serve to make it 4-2, but was unable to claw back another break as Halep took the first set 6-4.
Halep went for the jugular in the second set, opening with two quick breaks to take a 3-0 lead. Barty offered a flicker of resistance in the fourth game after earning three break points to go to 0-40.
But once again Halep's experience came to the fore and she fought back to deuce and saved another break point before holding for 4-0.
Both players then held before Halep soon took three match points at 0-40 in the seventh game.
Barty fought back to deuce to delay the inevitable, but Halep secured another break to reach her third Canadian final in four years.  AFP

Healing a world on fire
The fire referred here is raging fires across the world brought on by record temperatures and excessive heat seen and felt in many parts of the world.
We are speaking at a time when the world is on fire. This summer, 119 people in Japan died in a heat wave, 29 were killed in South Korea, officials there say. Ninety-one people in Greece died in wildfires, and ongoing fires in California have taken at least eight lives. Spain and Portugal sweltered through an exceptionally hot weekend with a heat wave that has killed three people in Spain and pushed temperatures toward record levels. As the UK goes through its longest dry spell in 40 years, demand for water has risen by almost a third, according to the water industry, and Northern Ireland has imposed a hosepipe ban. Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has warned that the country has become a land of drought as he announced further measures to help stricken farmers. Although it is still winter, parts of eastern Australia are experiencing the worst drought in living memory. Ninety-nine per cent of New South Wales, which is the country's most populous state and provides around a quarter of the country's agricultural output, is currently in drought.
This brings us to an ominous warning from Prof. Ranil Senanayake, an authority of climate change which is when plant cells die when the temperature becomes unbearable. The prolonged consequences would be catastrophic. Similarly, fauna, flora and the world of animals is suffering immensely. We are for example seeing livestock and animals in general gasping for breath due to unbearable heat in Europe. In Africa, they quite simply die.
Ecosystems services in a Blue-Green economy
The passage below comes from a letter sent last year by this writer to State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne suggesting MoF constitutes a committee of experts to go over the issues.
In the words of Prof. Ranil Senanayake, primary Ecosystem Services are those produced by the photosynthetic activity of plants. These are the production of Oxygen, sequestration of Carbon Dioxide, cleaning water and providing ambient cooling. They help us breathe, have drinking water, food, and protect from excessive heat. Per acre per year if Sri Lanka capitalized these values we could escape from out debt trap in two years.
Sri Lanka should seriously consider implementing this programme to correct the exploitation of natural resources and its owners, induce sustainable environmental practices and practice sound economics. Most importantly as Prof. Ranil Senanayake states, there is a transfer of wealth to rural areas which crucially enable life in urban areas.
Measuring water print to design an ecosystem service.
Thematically be it leisure, garments, agriculture etc an assessment of Water footprint can be deployed (The CDN had an interesting feature article last week on this topic). It went to say, Water footprint referring to the amount of water used to produce different products or provide a different type of services to the human beings. For example, the amount of water used to produce a shoe or a shirt is the water footprint of that particular article. It can be estimated for a product, a service, an individual, a country and even the whole world. An individuals consumption of fresh water based on the products and services he or she uses or consumes per year is that persons water footprint. Measuring water footprint and taking all the necessary steps to keep that level as low as possible is extremely important for mankind. This balance is urgently required because freshwater is vital to our daily life while the supply of freshwater is limited.
We in 2005 the world was warned. We did see Cop21 being signed. The Paris Agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) dealing with greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance starting in the year 2020. The European continent is now being warned graphically on the consequences of insufficient action.
Across the world as well as back home we need to be wise, proactive and not wait for Government only to take leadership on matters vital for the survival of life on Earth.

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment
The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is a major assessment of the human impact on the environment, called for by the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 2000, launched in 2001 and published in 2005 which had prophetic warnings.
* Climate change will directly alter ecosystem services, for example, by causing changes in the productivity and growing zones of cultivated and non- cultivated vegetation.
* Climate change is projected to exacerbate the loss of biodiversity and increase the risk of extinction for many species, especially those already at risk due to factors such as low population numbers, restricted or patchy habitats, and limited climatic ranges (medium to high certainty).
* Water availability and quality are projected to decrease in many arid and semiarid regions (high certainty).
* The risk of floods and droughts is projected to increase (high certainty).
* Agricultural productivity is projected to decrease in the tropics and sub-tropics for almost any amount of warming (low to medium certainty), and there are projected adverse effects on fisheries.
All the warnings have come true.
****
Sri Lanka
Four per cent of the countrys land area is covered by water. We have 103 distinct natural rivers, manmade lakes and canals accounting for over 10,000 Countrywide.
A candid Government document recommending a Water Security Council makes reference to -
* Limited availability of fresh water on a long-term basis, especially in the dry zone.
* The steady growth of population, demanding, basically for increased food production and improved living (sanitary) conditions, which are based on water, in addition to the demand, merged for industrial use, hydropower generation and other uses.
* Contamination of existing water resources by increased human activities causing adverse effects on water quality and on the environment.
* The increasing trend in delaying the implementation of new water resources development projects due to higher project costs, lack of funds and social and environmental problems.
* Poor institutional capacities, lack of clear understanding of guidelines and policies and messed up priorities in managing the already developed water resources.
We do not know how much water we have underground. We do not know how much water we have in our national underwater sump. But we draw on it merrily without a care in the world.

Hitting the roof
Every dog owner knows how much their beloved pets miss them when theyre gone, even if its just a quick walk to the post office. At the exact moment you return back, your buddy just bursts with joy, ready to celebrate your arrival.
But this six-year-old Vizsla Murray is not really an ordinary example. This dog has his own creative way to show how happy he is when his owner finally arrives home, and the internet is already loving it. Instead of wagging his tail and preparing for cuddles, Murray climbs to the highest point of his owner AJ Allees house to proudly greet him in a unique way.
We didnt realize it until neighbors came and rang our doorbell, AJ Allee told Bored Panda.
It was terrifying because we were afraid he would jump or fall. He moved so quickly on the roof and ran to the edge, then stopped.
AJ Allee first tried to get on the patio and try to get Murray from there, then find how he got there and block the entrance to prevent it from happening again.
That lasted three days, says AJ Allee.
He found another place so we accepted it. Then it became funny.
AJ Allee says that Murray always goes up to talk to anyone who is walking their dog in the neighborhood or driving by their house.
Then they would come to our door and tell us about it, we have to act shocked, laughs AJ Allee. The Sun

How to learn by doing nothing: observational learning!
Monkey see, monkey do has been a pejorative American idiom for ages, most often deployed by parents when scolding children for emulating a friends naughty behavior. Now, courtesy of the internet and streaming video, the phrase takes on a new, positive meaning.
Recently, the Wall Street Journal reported on a growing new trend in which students are studying by watching videos of other students studying online. Some of these videos have been viewed over half a million times; the number of sites offering these so-called study-with-me videos trebled between 2017 and 2016; and one of the sites has more than a quarter of a million subscribers.
Mind you, these videos are not tutorials, they are simply long (one of them runs two and a half hours) static images of students poring over their textbooks and their notes.
Artistic endeavor
Reading the article brought to mind Andy Warhols 1964 film, Empire, which consisted of a single static shot of the Empire State Building that ran for eight hours!
The rationale for Warhols film, being an artistic endeavor, is open to interpretation, but there are some very substantial reasons for why students passively watching other students studying, can be effective.
The first is scientific. In 1992, a team of Italian neuroscientists working with laboratory monkeys found that the monkeys were mimicking the researchers physical actions. They attributed this behavior to a set of nerve cells in the brain called mirror neurons, dubbed Monkey see, monkey do. Mirror neurons became, as Psychology Today called them, The Most Hyped Concept in Neuroscience, prompting countless articles and books. Prominent among them was Daniel Golemans bestselling Social Intelligence, in which he proclaimed that humans are wired to connect. Clearly, those hundreds of thousands of students who are watching feel quite connected to the students who are studying. Although the observers are not studying themselves, the videos provide them with an opportunity to take a break and yet remain in the study zone. The WSJ article quotes a professor of educational psychology and learning sciences who said,  the people making these videos are tapping into a need where you want to be social without being disrupted from your study goals. And lets not forget that, for the current generation of students, connecting virtually is their preferred mode of communication.
One-on-one session
In personal support of the value of passive observation, I offer my own work as a presentation coach. I am frequently asked to coach an executive in a one-on-one session. In response I ask that the individual bring one or two other participants, be they peers or aides, to the session. The reason is that people learn more when they watch others being coached than when they are being coached directly. This dynamic has long been well-known in educational circles as observational learning.
Now we know why, when we were students, we had study buddies: they fire up those mirror neurons and improve our learning. - Forbes

Husband, two accomplices arrested over wifes death
Wanduramba Police arrested an estate labourer, together with his brother and brothers wife, in connection with the death of his wife, at Kurumini Banagalawa in Kokawala, Pilagodawatte, recently.
The suspects and the victims were all employed on the estate.
The deceased was identified as M. Wijayalakshmi (28). Following information of the incident, Wanduramba Police, after preliminary investigations, arrested her husband, K. Singhara Welu (32), and the two other suspects.
The victims daughters, aged six and eight, are in the custody of their grandfather (the victims father), at Pitadeniya in Wanduramba.
On the day of the incident, the victim and the suspects had received their wages from the Pilagoda Estate Superintendent. That night, the husband had gone to the village marketplace to buy bread for dinner and moonshine. Wijayalakshmi had allegedly consumed a little of the moonshine, over which the couple had quarrelled.
After investigations, police found she had been killed by strangling.
After a futile attempt to portray the death as suicide by hanging, the following morning the husband had informed the grama niladhari of the division about the death.
He told the officer that his wife went to bed as usual the previous night and had not woken up that morning. However, police investigated the incident further.
Acting Baddegama Magistrate Weerasiri Dias held the magisterial inquiry into the murder and ordered the body to be sent to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital for postmortem.
On instructions from ASP Dulshan Nagahawatte, a team of investigators led by Wanduramba Police OIC Rukman Kumara is carrying out further investigations.

Injured du Plessis unavailable for Zimbabwe series
Faf du Plessis is South Africas cricket captain across all formats. However, he is likely to miss the teams upcoming limited overs series against Zimbabwe, owing to injury woes.
The player suffered his second shoulder injury in the space of a year while featuring in the Sri Lankan tour. Du Plessis, who had to undergo surgery on his right shoulder in as recent as December 2017, tore his rotator-cuff set of tendons in the same shoulder while attempting a fielding effort against the Lankans.
He has evidently been rested, keeping in mind the impending busy summer, after which the team will also be a part of the ICC World Cup scheduled for May and June 2019. Its important to get the shoulder as strong as possible, du Plessis said on his arrival back to Cape Town on Friday.
Playing against Zimbabwe would be nice but an extra few weeks (of recovery) would be good. I was under pressure before the India series but I managed to get through it. No disrespect to Zimbabwe but theres a lot of cricket still to be played. The long-term goal is the most important thing, he added. He obviously meant the likes of the World Cup, and his career itself, which cant be put at stake by playing with an injury.

Jaffna uniquely positioned for dual-hub IT strategy - STAX
Sri Lankas leading management consulting firm, STAX, recently launched a research report outlining a dual-hub IT strategy for Jaffna. In collaboration with Market Development Facility (MDF), STAX released this report with a view to fostering the regions substantial potential for IT-related services in line with the national drive to develop a globally-competitive IT industry in Sri Lanka.
Earlier this year, the Government unveiled its plans for Island of Ingenuity (IOI), a LKR 300M investment in the ICT/BPM sector. By 2022, Sri Lankas IT/BPM sector is expected to reach $5bn in revenue, create 200,000 direct jobs and encompass 1,000 start-ups. STAXs report highlights that Jaffna is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the sectors growing momentum, ultimately expanding its own contribution to the sector and the wider national economy.
Among the noteworthy attributes, we observe a positive and entrepreneurial attitude among the Jaffna communities, who also retain a strong connection to the Sri Lankan diaspora  which could lead to opportunities for investment and knowledge transfer. The region also maintains a high literacy rate while already possessing the necessary ICT infrastructure and a range of opportunities for IT education, the report noted.
Specifically, the report called for the dual-hub strategy to be centered on the development of an Outsourced IT Hub together with the establishment of a Start-up Hubboth of which could be concurrently fostered while delivering returns along different timelines.
The Outsourced Hub would involve relatively low-risk activities capable of garnering quick returns in employment, productivity, revenue and IT skilling. Initially, the report envisioned its implementation within the format of a 1,000-person managed services operation that matches local talent to outsourced demand with a gradual focus on upscaling to accommodate new market opportunities.
When considering the implementation of this hub, there are at least three potential avenues through which a Managed Services operation in Jaffna can carve a niche for itself in IT/BPO outsourcing, both globally and island-wide: Quality Assurance, Tamil Call Centers and KPO for Accounting Services, the report added.
Comparatively, STAX envisions the Jaffna Start-up Hub as providing greater long-term returns for the region and the national economy, initially focusing on the development of complex and strategic areas of expertise in specific innovations and creating a strong network of IP skills that would shift the focus from importing foreign technology to encouraging and embracing homegrown innovation.
The report advocated a combination of traditional and creative startup strategies. While the traditional start-ups could focus on specialized web and app-based development and search engine optimization, the creative start-ups could be oriented around prevailing primary industries in the North  including agriculture, farming, fisheries, tourism and health  in addition to catering to industries of necessity through products like smart street lighting, waste management, health, travel and education related apps.
The viability of this strategy is already borne out in the organic maneuvers of prominent Sri Lankan IT start-up accelerators like Yarl IT Hub and NCIT and IT companies like WS02, Microimage and InfoMate.
The current challenge, however, is that many such forward-thinking players operate in isolation or do not benefit from adequate access to resources. Through the formal inclusion of these organic activities in a dedicated strategy for Jaffna, the goal is to build momentum and focus in terms of investment and activity being channeled into this space, whether via global or local investors, the report stated.
The recommendations of the report are informed by a detailed assessment of the overall IT industry in Jaffna and the broader Northincluding over 100+ conversations across industry experts, national IT enablers, IT accelerators, private sector companies, local government, diaspora members, Jaffna-based employees and universities and schools.
For interested investors and stakeholders, there is a clear call to action. The first order of business is to conduct an evaluation of the financial and technical feasibility of developing a Managed Services operation for the Outsourced Hub. Subsequently, there is a need to secure smart capital for this effort, which will include crafting a compelling story when pitching to relevant investors.
As STAXs Managing Director Ruwindhu Peiris said, Global success stories like Malaysias Cyberjaya make it clear that digital hubs are the product of a catalytic movement where investors and digital companies grow to a critical mass. For this to happen, all key stakeholders need to come together in a cohesive move. Otherwise, theres only dispersion.
In essence, local IT education providers need to develop industry-ready graduates.Colombo-based IT companies need to move past perceptions and seriously investigate the viability of setting up in the North. Members of the diaspora need to be engaged to create targeted flows of funding and technology transfer. Northern start-up accelerators need to cultivate the funds and partnerships necessary to foster new entrants. The Government needs to collaborate with external funding agencies, private-sector players, non-profit organizations and other investors to further develop the infrastructure and incentives for a digital hub.
Above all, the movement needs to be communicated to the masses. In that sense, this report comes at a critical juncture. As Mano Sekaram, CEO and Co-Founder of 99X Technology said, For a long time, the biggest drawback weve faced as investors and stakeholders is the absence of a bankable document to promote Jaffna as an IT hub - this report is a step in the right direction and an important conversation starter.

Traditionally, the Kapa (a part of a Panasa tree) is cut and taken from the Aluthnuwara Sri Dedimunda Devalaya complex. Thereafter, it is taken in a perahera replete with elephants to the Vishnu Devalaya in Kandy passing 26 kms. The procession will parade passing Aluthnuwara, Hingula, Ganetenna, Pahala Kadugannawa, Kadugannawa, Pilimatalawa and Peradeniya.
Trustee of the Aluthnuwara Dedimunda Devalaya Dhamsiri Karunaratne said the Kapa was taken in turn on the backs of three elephants in the perahera.

Kenya crush Tunisia to set up Namibia clash for World Cup spot
NAIROBI, Saturday - Kenya ran in eleven tries to crush Tunisia 67-0 in their penultimate game of the 2019 World Cup qualifying tournament on Saturday, setting up a winner-takes-all showdown against Namibia next weekend.
Debutant Willy Ambaka made a perfect transition from sevens to the traditional form of the game when he put Kenya ahead with the first try after only four minutes of play.
The winger picked up a loose ball in the middle of the Tunisian defence to open the scoring for the Simbas, who are set play Namibia in the tournament decider in Windhoek next week.
Kenyan coach Ian Snook said he planned to make a few changes to the team for the final match.
The result against Tunisia was good. But we need a lot of things to be fixed before we play Namibia. Tactically there will be changes to the team, said Snook.
After a scrappy opening 20 minutes, punctuated by handling errors and poor passes, Kenya outclassed an injury-weakened Tunisian side, which is taking part in the tournament for the first time.
Tries from skipper Davis Chenge, Andrew Chogo, Jacob Ojee, Elkean Musonye and Darwin Mukidza and five conversions from the golden boot of Mukidza combined to give the home side a commanding 40-0 half-time lead.
Martin Owila scored the seventh try straight from the kick-off to stretch the Kenyan lead, before the home side were reduced to 14 men after Hillary Mwanjilwa was yellow-carded.
Tunisia also had two players sent to the sin bin and could not resist the Kenyan pressure.
Owila, who earned the man-of-the match accolade for his performance, Peter Kaaria, Mohammed Omolo and Ambaka both added tries to complete the rout.
Kenya picked up the maximum five points to stay second in the final African qualifying group on 17 points, three behind Namibia.
The winner gains an automatic place in the tournament in Japan next year, the second-place team plays a repechage
In Kampala, strong finishes to each half earned Uganda a 47-29 victory over Morocco, which ensured the hosts of top-tier African rugby next season.
Tries by Michael Wokorach and Ivan Magomu stretched a nine-point advantage to a 30-7 lead by half-time at Kyadondo Stadium in the Ugandan capital. When a Naoufal el Kadli penalty narrowed the gap to just four points in the second half, Uganda responded with tries from Pius Ogena and substitute Solomon Okia.
Full-back Philip Wokorach, who scored 37 points when they thrashed Tunisia last weekend, was an impeccable goal-kicker, slotting five conversions and four penalties from nine attempts.
South African referee Rasta Rasivhenge had his hands full during the match, spending as much time explaining basic laws of the game as he did officiating.
A Moroccan forward initially refused to leave the field during the second half after the match commissioner had declared him unfit to continue following a head injury.  AFP

For over a year, new and expensive dialysis machines installed at the Kuliyapitiya Base Hospital, are idling due to the lack of trained doctors.
A large sum of public funds had been invested for the machinery, but it had all been in vain, Kurunegala District Senior Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake said, while speaking to the media on Saturday.
He said that at present, there were about 27,530 kidney patients countrywide and of them, there were around 16,682 kidney patients in the North Central Province.
About 1,118 kidney patients had died in 2017, in the North Central Province. Due to those reasons, health authorities should take steps to utilise the medical equipment for the benefit of underprivileged kidney patients who seek medical treatment at government hospitals in future.

lawyers to seek Rs.100 mn compensation for Glyphosate deaths
Professor Channa Jayasumana of the Rajarata University said yesterday that discussions are underway to file a case in the Supreme Court seeking compensation of Rs.100 million for each victim of cancer and kidney disease caused by the Glyphosate agro chemical.
Professor Jayasumana said that there will be four parties including the farming community, researchers, patients suffering from these diseases and the families of persons who died from these diseases and added legal action will be taken on behalf of all these parties.
Professor Jayasumana also said that they will request President Maithripala Sirisena to conduct an impartial inquiry on lifting the ban on Glyphosate.
There are several people who gave written support over lifting the ban on Glyphosate. Lifting the ban was not a good move as the agrochemical is highly harmful, he pointed out. Professor Jayasumana also said, About 25,000 people have died due to kidney diseases in Sri Lanka and Glyphosate may be a major factor. He said experts can prove that 35 cancer patients who have died too contracted the disease due to exposure to Glyphosate.
Research has proven that this agro chemical has a direct impact on the kidneys and could cause cancers, he added.
The recent court decision against the Monsanto Company in California, San Francisco, United States will be taken as a model case for this legal action against the Glyphosate agro chemical, Professor Jayasumana pointed out.

When you venture outside your home, stop scrolling through Twitter, and walk through the doors of a library, something magical happens.
Its so quiet, so peaceful. You can smell the pages of old books. You nestle into a cosy seat, pick a book that takes your fancy, and forget about everything going on outside those walls. A library is the ultimate escape  from the noise and bustle of the outside world, into a place of peace and quiet, into wherever your book takes you.
Oh, and so many of them are absolutely stunning, as they should be, when were talking about places that honour knowledge, art, and creative thought.
To pay tribute to the magic of libraries, Italian photographer Massimo Listri has travelled around the world capturing the beautiful pieces where books spend their time.

Making your garden soil more fertile
Soil Testing
The first step to creating the perfect growing environment is to have a good understanding of what you have to work with.
Specifically, we should be looking for nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous levels. We also need to pay attention to the pH level and some soil tests even detect the amount of organic matter as well.
Understanding the exact nutrient levels in the soil allows us to amend soil properly for the best crop production possible. Most agriculture extension offices offer free or low-cost soil testing and there are a variety of commercial testing services as well.
Adjusting Soil
Most of us are not blessed with perfectly aerated soil automatically. Your soil might be too sandy or contain too much clay (which drastically affects aeration and water drainage). Although it takes some time to properly adjust soil, it is possible.
The best way is to mix chopped organic matter (leaves for example) into the soil and mix well. Some people even our liquid nitrogen into the mixture to speed up the decomposition process.
Unfortunately, this technique is best exercised in the fall as it takes time for the decomposition process to occur.
If you didnt think that far ahead, there is another solution. Adding high-quality organic potting soil promotes strong root development and robust plant growth. Potting soil should be mixed at least 8  12 deep into existing soil. It does take some work, but it is well worth the effort when your crops begin to take off in these improved soil conditions.
Consider pH Level
Most soil tests include a pH reading of the sample, but if not, most garden centers sell inexpensive pH testing kits you can use at home to get a pretty good estimate of your soils pH level.
Most vegetables prefer soil that is slightly acidic (a pH level below 7.0). As a general rule, soil on the East Coast tends to be more acidic and soil on the West Coast is more alkaline (pH level above 7.0) due to the arid summers.
Properly amending your soil for proper pH levels starts with knowing what you want to grow. A quick Google search should provide tons of results about proper pH level for any crop. Blueberries, for instance, thrive in extremely acidic soil that would kill many other fruit and vegetable species.
If your soil is alkaline, consider adding gypsum or elemental sulfur to lower the pH level. Sawdust, composted leaves and peat moss are also good alternatives.
Soil that is too acidic can be amended using limestone (calcium carbonate), bone meal and crushed oyster shells. Hardwood ash, sometimes known as potash, also works well. I save all the ash from my wood stove expressly for this purpose as my soil tends to be slightly too acidic by spring.
Adding Compost
Compost is the single best thing you can do to improve soil quality right now. Whether you maintain your own compost pile or purchase bags of organic material from the local gardening store, compost possesses all the qualities our gardens need to thrive year after year.
Not only is compost full of organic nutrients, but the composition of properly matured compost provides better water drainage and aeration in just about every type of soil imaginable.
While it may be too late to start a compost pile in time for this planting season, by this time next year you will have all the organic fertilizer/soil amendment you could possibly need to support a healthy crop.
By spending a little time with your soil before planting crops this year, you can drastically increase the production of your garden and the overall quality of the food on your table year after year.

Monsanto ordered to pay $289 million as jury rules weedkiller caused mans cancer
Monsanto suffered a major blow with a jury ruling that the company was liable for a terminally ill mans cancer, awarding him $289 m in damages.
Dewayne Johnson, a 46-year-old former groundskeeper, won a huge victory in the landmark case on Friday, with the jury determining that Monsantos Roundup weedkiller caused his cancer and that the corporation failed to warn him of the health hazards from exposure. The jury further found that Monsanto acted with malice or oppression.
Johnsons lawyers argued over the course of a month-long trial in San Francisco that Monsanto had fought science for years and targeted academics who spoke up about possible health risks of the herbicide product. Johnson was the first person to take the agrochemical corporation to trial over allegations that the chemical sold under the brand Roundup causes cancer.
In the extraordinary verdict, which Monsanto said it intends to appeal, the jury ruled that the company was responsible for negligent failure and knew or should have known that its product was dangerous.
We were finally able to show the jury the secret, internal Monsanto documents proving that Monsanto has known for decades that ... Roundup could cause cancer, Johnsons lawyer Brent Wisner said in a statement.
Cancer survivors
The verdict, he added, sent a message to Monsanto that its years of deception regarding Roundup is over and that they should put consumer safety first over profits.
Speaking in San Francisco on Friday, Johnson said that the jurys verdict is far bigger than his lawsuit. He said he hopes the case bolsters the thousands of similar lawsuits pending against the company and brings national attention to the issue.
Johnsons case was particularly significant because a judge allowed his team to present scientific arguments. The dispute centred on glyphosate, which is the worlds most widely used herbicide. The verdict came a month after a federal judge ruled that cancer survivors or relatives of the deceased could bring similar claims forward in another trial.
During the lengthy trial, the plaintiffs attorneys brought forward internal emails from Monsanto executives that they said demonstrated how the corporation repeatedly ignored experts warnings, sought favourable scientific analyses and helped to ghostwrite research that encouraged continued usage.
Monsanto has long argued that Roundup is safe and not linked to cancer and presented studies during trial that countered the research and testimony submitted by Johnsons team. The herbicide is registered in 130 countries and approved for use on more than 100 crops, but in 2015, the World Health Organizations international agency for research on cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans, triggering a wave of legal and legislative challenges.
After the trial, Scott Partridge, the vice-president of Monsanto, rejected any link between glyphosate and cancer, insisting the verdict doesnt change the four-plus decades of safe use and science behind the product.
Partridge said the IARC, whose evidence was key in persuading the jury of the link between glyphosate and cancer, has been demonstrated as having been corrupted, asserting the organisation does no testing, they do no analysis, they have no laboratories, they simply render an opinion.
Expert warnings
Speaking to the BBC Radio 4s Today show on Saturday, Partridge expressed sympathy for Johnson but continued to dispute the evidence used in the trial.
He said the internal company emails, which were used by Johnsons attorney as evidence the agrochemical firm had rejected critical research and expert warnings about the weedkiller, had been taken completely out of context.
Johnson, 46, is a father of three who worked as a groundskeeper and pest manager for the school district in Benicia, a suburb just north of San Francisco. That position began in 2012, and he testified that it involved him spraying herbicide to control weeds on school grounds, sometimes for several hours a day.
He argued that his exposure to the chemicals caused non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a blood cell cancer, and when he took the stand, he discussed his pain and suffering as skin lesions took over his body.
Ive been going through a lot of pain, Johnson, who goes by the name Lee, testified weeks earlier. It really takes everything out of you  Im not getting any better.
He also testified that Monsanto should not have let him use the herbicide near schoolchildren, saying: I never wouldve sprayed that product on school grounds or around people if I knew it would cause them harm.
Johnson may have just months to live, according to his doctors. His wife testified that she has had to work two jobs, sometimes with 14-hour days, to help pay for the medical bills.
The financial award included past and future economic losses and punitive damages.
Another Roundup cancer trial is scheduled to begin in the fall in St Louis, Missouri. According to Johnsons lawyers, Monsanto is facing more than 4,000 similar cases across the US. - The Guardian

Nadal sets up showdown with birthday boy Tsitsipas
TORONTO: Rafael Nadal beat Karen Khachanov 7-6 (7/3), 6-4 on Saturday to set up a final with birthday boy Stefano Tsitsipas at the Toronto Masters.
The Spanish icon will try on Sunday to spoil the 20th celebrations of the Greek youngster who reached the second final of his career by beating Wimbledon finalist Kevin Anderson 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 7-6 (9/7), saving a match point in victory.
World number one Nadal won a battle of the tennis generations with Tsitsipas last April in the Barcelona title match.
To win this match is important, its very important to be in the final of Toronto, Nadal said after running his season record to 39-3 in a match which ended after midnight local time.
Im motivated every day when I wake up, there is always something to improve, said the 32-year-old.
I want to stay around for as long as possible (in tennis). Top seed Nadal edged out the first set in a tiebreaker after a two-hour, rain-delayed start.
In the second, Nadal went about finishing up his business with a break in the third game and on his way to the win in just over an hour and a quarter.
Nadal leads the all-time list of Masters 1000 titles on 32.
He will be playing his 116th ATP final and stands two wins away from 80 trophies.
Tsitsipas, who will move to at least 15th in the rankings, became the first man since Jo-Wilfried Tsonga here in 2014 to defeat four Top 10 players at the same event.
He dispatched Dominic Thiem, Novak Djokovic, and Alexander Zverev before downing Anderson.
He will be the first unseeded finalist in Canada since Nicolas Kiefer in 2008.
It feels like Im playing Davis Cup and everyone is backing me up and theyre so supportive, Tsitsipas said.
Four wins against top 10 players. I would never imagine that I could pull this out in a single tournament.
Idont know if I got lucky with all those players, but somehow it happened that I played four top 10 and managed to beat them, which is a huge achievement for me and for my game this week. Tsitsipas worked for two hours, 48 minutes to secure his upset of the hard-serving South African, with Anderson going down with 10 aces.
It doesnt matter what the score. Im always going to attack. Im always going to go to the ball, Tsitsipas said.
My forehand is on fire at this moment. Hopefully it can remain like this tomorrow because it will be super important for me, the win tomorrow.
The outcome over Anderson was decided in a tight third-set tiebreaker, with Tsitsipas blowing his first two winning chances with a double-fault and a forehand error.
Anderson missed out on a match point off his own serve as Tsitsipas slammed over a backhand cross-court winner.
The Greek saved all four break points he faced while breaking Anderson once in the afternoon struggle.
Its obviously incredibly difficult losing a match like where its so close at such a big stage of the tournament, Anderson said.
I did what I could. I thought he played some really good tennis, especially when it mattered the most.
On the one match point that I had, hecame up with an unbelievable backhand cross-court winner - it was a very impressive effort from him.

Need for a pedagogy of good citizenship
Citizens of modern states need to learn to be adult, mature and responsible citizens that they may exercise the rights of citizenship in an honest and righteous manner in solidarity with other citizens. That means all citizens should acquire the relevant knowledge required to be good and acceptable citizens and imbibe such qualities as civic sense, sharing of community burdens and become truthful, just, fair, honest and considerate of the human dignity and equality of others and be submissive to the law of the State.
The vast majority of citizens of modern states have learnt to be democratic and law-abiding. It is always the comparative microscopic minority that causes confusion. They too need to be rehabilitated and reformed for society to thrive and for all to enjoy peace.
While all citizens are equal before the law, there is also a hierarchy and distinction of citizenship depending on the functions that devolve on various citizens and the areas and degrees of responsibility each citizen has as an individual, a member of a distinct community or as a member of an agency of the state.
Equality before the law does not make everyone equally intelligent, equally capable, gifted, talented, hardworking and productive, equally outgoing and service oriented and concerned about the well-being of others. Nevertheless, the structures of civilized society promote the contribution of the hands and minds and spirit of all to be responsible for one another. As all such responsibilities are services directed towards other citizens who are affected and benefit by the particular services rendered, it is necessary to value the importance of the services depending on nature and the circumstances of the services.
All good citizens live the whole of their lives protective of the common good and for the well-being of others. Flawed characters enter politics and even honoured professions on the pretext of service and exploit the community selfishly, sometimes to a very excessive degree. They denigrate human dignity.
Only good citizens qualified and capable of holding office should present themselves, be called upon or be nominated by political parties to be candidates for elections. When the electing citizens observe that the candidates presented to them are not at all suitable, it shows that those presenting themselves or the party leaders nominating them are failing to prove that those nominated are good citizens of integrity; it also shows that they do not have persons of quality.
This has led to the people distrusting the governments. From a corrupt political culture, only corrupt individuals will emerge. Dirty politicians cannot be made clean with the dirty water coming from a putrid political watercourse. However, the corrupt gang that wins praise the wisdom and maturity of the electorate.
From the evidence that transpires to the citizens, elected representatives and the high positioned administrators in State agencies very selfishly in an indiscreet and foolish manner disburse billions of rupees belonging to the State as if they had the power to do so. If it was their money, they wouldnt part with 0.0001% of the money they so disburse. These are individuals hardened in their anti-social behaviour; they cannot be reformed and should be judged and stripped of citizenship rights if found guilty of serious misdemeanours.
UNPROVED PEOPLES REPRESENTATIVES
The person leading the State, the Head of State (nowadays) elected for a period of time and considered the first citizen, has his/her function and duty to be concerned about the security, human dignity, rights, honour and general well-being of all the citizens and extend to them all just and equal treatment so that all will have a sense of belonging to the same State. It is in this very area that most of the heads of State have failed.
If he or she has a family, that family is considered the first family, a designation of honour that also confers certain definite liberties and privileges to facilitate the services that family may be called upon to render to other citizens and to the national community.
Assisting the head of State and the ministers are the citizens who exercise numerous functions on behalf of the State in the legislative, executive and judicial spheres enjoying certain liberties, privileges and honours that facilitate the responsibilities they are called upon to shoulder. Those who assist in all state agencies should be citizens of good standing usually selected not en masse or on political partisanship as is done usually in Sri Lanka, but purely on qualifications and merit carefully considering the nature of responsibilities that are to be vested in them. It is due to the selection of unsuitable individuals with rough edges that those in the summits of power face great embarrassment.
TO ATTEND TO ALL CITIZENS
The citizens each time they vote delegate to all national representatives the same assignment, to attend to the needs of all citizens. In Sri Lanka these representatives not only too often forget this obligation, they neglect to attend parliament to participate in important deliberations; while they are paid for their representing the people, now they have got used to being paid for attending each session; their concerns become partisan and limited to their race, caste, clan and political tribe.
There are also those who arrogate to themselves powers that have not been given to them; ministers have no power to pressurize bank managers to give them loans without collateral security; nor have the power to tell them to write off loans obtained by their numerous catchers; nowadays it seems quite common for power holders to engage in various types of financial jugglery and dubious business transactions; they presume to usurp power undemocratically in many and varied ways and become bad citizens, thus disqualifying themselves from being peoples representatives.
While some citizens are careless about exercising their franchise and abstain from voting due to their lacking civic conscience, some other citizens by their vote favour, not those who are concerned about the common good but those who are partial towards their factions.
Leaders and citizens need to be led away from a narrow understanding to a deeper one of good citizenship which does not eliminate the democratic and rightful attention that needs to be paid to distinct sections of the one nation. A particular attention to a weaker section or part of the nation does not detract attention from the greater whole.
Many modern states have citizens among the rulers and the ruled who have a good standard of citizenship and a conscientious awareness of the basic laws that govern them and they all abide by the duty of upholding the law while attending to their varied duties in state agencies or elsewhere. They consider upholding the law is more than gaining of silver and gold.
In Sri Lanka, respect for the established law and order is not at a high level. There is inordinate delay not only in enacting just and fair laws due to the lethargy of legislators, there is also delay in implementing them and meting out justice to the aggrieved.
If the law is in any way flawed, there is a procedure through which it should be rectified. But no one is above the law. And no lawbreaker should be given leeway to oppress law abiding citizens. And when anyone is punished for breaking the law, he cannot claim immunity from punishment due to a political party affiliation or a particular recognition by a sectarian group of people. Uncouth and foul-mouthed individuals who flout the law should not be allowed to get away with impunity; their unacceptable behaviour could become a precedent, to the detriment of society, permitting like-minded others to behave anti-socially in a similar manner.
In the context of today, Sri Lankan citizens have no other option than completely uprooting the existing rotten political culture and discarding it. Lest the same old rotten elements come back to power in a new guise, the intelligentsia needs to bear the burden of reasoning with and educating all the citizens toward a revitalized and heightened civic sense and persuading them to reform themselves first and then to transcend clannish and narrow tribal and caste tendencies and move towards greater social responsibility in view of the greater good of the future generations.

New homes for Dunsinane estate workers under Indian housing project
Over 400 estate workers from the Dunsinane Estate in Pundaluoya in Nuwara Eliya were vested with land ownership for houses that was constructed under the Indian Housing Project in the plantation area. In a special message by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he congratulated the new owners and hailed their efforts for actively participating in building those houses.
At a special ceremony held on Sunday morning, estate workers braved the rains to attend this historic occasion where over 400 beneficiaries received their title ownerships.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address on the occasion highlighted the uniqueness of the participatory owner-driven approach of the Indian Housing Project where the beneficiaries actively participate in building the houses.
The Indian Premier underscored that the Indian Housing Project in Sri Lanka with a grant of over US$ 350 million, was the largest Indian grant assistance project in any country abroad. Prime Minister Modi also recalled that out of the total commitment of 60,000 houses by India, close to 47,000 houses have been built.
Prime Minister Modi recalling the launch of expansion of the pre-hospital Emergency Ambulance Service throughout Sri Lanka last month, commencement of Air India flights from Colombo to Varanasi in August 2017 and the signing of agreement for construction of 10,000 houses in the plantation areas yesterday, expressed satisfaction that promises made during his visit to Sri Lanka last year have been kept.
Expressing that Sri Lanka has been and will remain special for India, the Indian Prime Minister reiterated Government and People of Indias commitment to be with the people of Sri Lanka in their journey towards greater peace and prosperity.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickeremesinghe appreciated Indias commitment to partner with Sri Lanka in development projects including in building houses for in Upcountry areas.
On the same occasion, the Letter of Exchange for construction of an additional 10,000 houses in the plantation areas was signed by High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu and Hill Country, New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister Palani Digambaram.
It may be recalled that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had committed to construct these additional houses during his visit to Sri Lanka in 2017. With this agreement the commitment of India for building houses in the plantation areas meant for estate workers has risen to 14,000.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu, Hill Country, New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister Palani Digambaram, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake and Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake were also present.
Several Members of Parliament, Central Provincial Council members, senior Government officials, Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT), Regional Plantation Company officials and a large number of people from Dunsinane Estate, including the beneficiaries and their families attended the function.

Out of the Shadows
When the meals were delivered to the camp residents, N.G. Kamalawathi noticed that not everyone was eating. The camp, for Internally Displaced Persons (IDP), served regular meals, but people with hearing disabilities were often unaware that food was being served, and mobility-impaired residents could not reach the food quickly enough to eat it.
These were some of the problems that Kamalawathi, President of the Association of Women with Disabilities (AKASA), recorded while visiting the camp, after the war, to assess the experiences of war-affected women with disabilities.
Its the same thing that happens in so-called regular life, said Dinesha Samararatne, professor of Public and International Law at the Faculty of Law, Colombo University, except it becomes more complex, more risky really, in a war-affected context.
Disability as diversity
Binendri Perera (right) presents the report to Human Rights Commissioner of Sri Lanka, Ambika Satkunanathan.
The word disability has a broad meaning. It can denote cognitive, developmental, intellectual, mental, physical, or sensory impairment, or even some combination of these. In rural societies, where often no single word conveys the breadth of disability, it is expressed as a functional inability. For example, a woman might say, I am unable to do what I need to do in the home like everybody else. In urban areas, where the term disability exists, people frequently fail to distinguish between the impairment and the person, calling them disabled.
Language exposes social prejudice, but also, the vernaculars surrounding disability reveal absence - where discussions have not yet happened, where rights are waiting to be acknowledged or applied. This is exactly where the legalacademic report, Out of the Shadows: War-affected Women with Disabilities in Sri Lanka, begins, by breaking that silence.
Out of the Shadows, a collaboration of authors, institutions, and countries, was written by Dinesha Samararatne, Karen Soldatic, a fellow at the Australian Research Council at Western Sydney University, and Binendri Perera, visiting lecturer, also at the Faculty of Law. It was sponsored in large part by the Law & Society Trust (LST), and was launched recently by Human Rights Commissioner of Sri Lanka, Ambika Satkunanathan. This was done by the people, for the people, and for the rights of the people, said Sandun Thudugala, Executive Director of the LST, at the reports launch.
A place for dialogue
Out of the Shadows looks at war-affected women with disabilities as a specific community that must contend with a unique set of barriers: the barriers faced by people with disabilities, how those barriers must be carefully navigated as women, and how those women must contend with the manifold obstacles of a war-affected context.
In developing societies and war-affected contexts, what happens is that resources are scarce. If it comes to a choice, what often happens is, people with disability, the elderly, they often end up being the sort of groups in societies that have the least access to these resources, said Samararatne.
As a community, war-affected women with disabilities have only ever been mentioned in two national-level documents before this one: the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission report (LLRC) in 2010, and the report of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTF) in 2016. Out of the Shadows is a first step towards national acknowledgement and discussion of these womens rights, which are the rights of all Sri Lankans, enshrined in the Constitution.
The authors wanted the report to be accessible to the widest possible audience, and stylistically chose a bulleted numbering system for their findings and recommendations. However, the reports findings, based on personal interviews that explore the lived experiences of 23 women, never incorporate quotes or narratives from the interviewees. Samararatne explained why they chose this approach. It was deliberately outcome-focused, she said, because this kind of a report can be contentious, and we thought that its best to focus on the findings and then the recommendations, rather than the narratives, at this stage.
Samararatne imagines a point sometime in the future when people debate and discuss the personal narratives of war-affected women with disabilities. But as of now, her goal is to create space in which to facilitate that discussion. In Samararatnes mind, this is the beginning of a long process for women who have largely been erased from mainstream political and social conversations.
Points of engagement
A section of the audience at the launch.
In conducting their research, Samararatne and her co-authors never distinguished between women whose disabilities were caused before the conflict and women whose disabilities were caused by the conflict. If a woman identified herself as war-affected, and if she identified herself as being a woman with a disability, and was willing to give an interview, she was included in the study, said Samararatne. In this way, the study sought to avoid the contentious political debates of a war-affected context. There is a lot of disagreement around who should be entitled reparations. We didnt want this study to get caught up in that debate at this stage, because this is one of the first studies that is flagging the issues of war-affected women with disability, and we want that to be the focus. Then people who want to use the findings can take them and connect them with the debate on reparations or debate on transitional justice.
In a post-war society like Sri Lanka, where people are divided by different languages, disabilities, and ethnicities, Samararatne and her colleagues realised that they would have to do research in a different way. One of the ways in which this study is unique, is how it places women with disabilities on equal footing with the researchers. Women with disabilities were not only the subjects of the study, but also the interviewers, integral to the process of data collection rather than passive subjects. While none of the authors have disabilities, they enlisted the help of AKASA, Navajeevana (Tangalle), Womens Development Centre (WDC) and Viluthu (in Jaffna) to identify participants for the studies, and to conduct the interviews.
Another inclusive effort of Out of the Shadows was the initiative to do pre-consultations with all of the women interviewed before the report was published. The authors engaged with the women interviewed about the progression of their research and its analytical findings. The report says that the participants were extremely pleased with the research engagement strategy as it gave them an opportunity to ensure fair and just representation of their views.
In conducting their research, the authors made efforts to be aware of the sensitivities of a war-affected context. They shied away from interviewing women who seemed to face severe psychological trauma from the war, because we didnt want to re-traumatise them, said Samararatne. From the beginning we were sensitive to the fact that we were not there to extract information and narratives for the sake of it.
Revelations
The interpreter.
One of the most wrenching findings in the report is that women with disabilities who were interviewed for this study had no awareness of their human rights or about the concept of human rights in general. They were not aware of the idea of transitional justice or about any specific initiatives that were being taken by the government for reconciliation. None of them were aware of the process underway for Constitutional reforms. This finding brings to light a dire need for these women to be acknowledged at a social and political level. Without it, they may not even recognise their own basic human rights.
On a cultural level, the report found complex relationships between the women and their communities. On the one hand, local superstitions stigmatise women with disabilities. Women with disabilities are considered unsuitable for marriage, except for perhaps a mans second marriage. On the other hand, the authors learnt that in the South, religion could be a source of empowerment. War-affected women with disabilities practising Buddhism said that their religious engagement offered them a sense of peace and wellbeing. But this finding came with an important caveat: They note that they feel marginalised from religious institutions due to stigma and lack of physical access. Their response has been to organise their own religious ceremonies and also participate in mainstream religious observances when possible.
Another important finding of the document was the disparity between emergency and regular healthcare. Almost all women interviewed for this study stated that the emergency healthcare they received from state hospitals was excellent, the study says. Yet, on a day-to-day basis, accessing regular healthcare services was difficult, due to lack of physical access, lack of adequate transport facilities and delays in the provision of healthcare. Likely, the problems that women with disabilities faced in accessing regular healthcare are due to the fact that disabilities have not been normalised in society.
Access to information
For society to acknowledge war-affected women with disabilities, information must be reconsidered and the process of data collection restructured, so that it no longer erases their existence, explained AKASA President Kamalawathi. There arent common statistics, she said, and not even the normal statistics are done correctly. She pointed to the fact that few distinctions are made between women and men with disabilities in data figures.
Data on education for people with disabilities does not distinguish between genders, though education is frequently less accessible to women than to men. National employment for people with disabilities, which does distinguish based on gender, reveals that only 41.1 percent of people with disabilities are employed, of whom 61.1 percent are men and only 24.4 percent are women. Kamalawathi says that there is a glaring need to disaggregate womens disability research from mens in Sri Lanka, where women may face added social inhibitors to their independence.
Out of the Shadows speaks to Kamalawathis point: There is almost no research that examines the day-to-day lives of women with disabilities within post-war and post-conflict contexts. Nor is there any substantive research that documents their subjective experiences of transitional governance, policy and programming, and how they are included and/or excluded from a society emerging from protracted armed conflict.
The report attests to how inaccurate or missing information about war-affected women with disabilities makes them the most vulnerable community in a post-conflict situation. Without broad social acknowledgement and acceptance of their rights and needs, their abilities become squandered. They experience the highest levels of gender-related violence, abject poverty, stigmatisation and exclusion. And critically, the lack of improvement to their quality of life is evidence that deeper, unresolved aspects of the conflict still persist.

Greater Kurunegala Water Supply and Sewerage Project
PM to vest project with people today
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will vest the Greater Kurunegala Water Supply and Sewerage Project with the people today.
The upgrade of the Kurunegala drinking water supply scheme was a long-standing requirement of the Kurunegala Municipal area and its suburbs.
This project was undertaken to provide quality solutions for the problems of drinking water and sanitation facilities for householders, government and private sector offices, schools, hospitals, tourist hotels, and the daily floating population which exceeds 100,000.
With rapid development, Kurunegala city became congested and the wastewater and sewage was channelled into the main municipal drains, as there was no systematic sewage management system.
Apart from that, most septic tanks in households are not up to standard and leak into the open. This led to contamination of Kurunegala Lake and most wells. For these reasons, a proper sewerage system was needed.
Under these circumstances, the Greater Kurunegala Water Supply and Sewerage Project, which consists of an integrated water supply and sewerage system, was carried out from 2014 to 2018 for Kurunegala and its suburbs.
The project aims to provide safe and adequate drinking water for people living in Kurunegala MC and its suburbs. The project will provide water for a floating population which exceeds 100,000, while facilitating about 45,000 in the city limits. The project will also facilitate the General Hospital in Kurunegala, with a 24-hour water supply.
It will also provide for the disposal of wastewater for 3,500 domestic and commercial institutions through a well-organised sewerage network.
The government is providing Rs. 3,200 million for the project and a loan of US$ 77.3 million from the Chinese government too has been obtained.
A new raw water plant with a capacity of 15,000m3 has been built close to Deduru Oya Reservoir in Bakmeegolla using the latest technology available, to transmit raw water up to 8.3km through transmission lines (500 mm DI) to the treatment plant in Kurunegala.
Two existing water treatment plants have been rehabilitated to produce 9,000 m3 of water per day. Thus, it is capable of generating 14,000m3 of clean drinking water per day.
The new reservoir has been constructed above the old water treatment plant to store 1,500m3 of treated water. Another new water tank has been constructed at Wehera (750m3) to serve the people in the area.

The real way to keep your brain sharp in old age
In a recent interview for the New York Times, Lisa Feldman Barrett, Professor of Psychology at Northeastern University in Boston, offered some advice to older people to help them keep their cognitive skills as finely tuned as possible.
Challenge yourself, she urged, to learn new things on a regular basis  but dont just do so casually. Study any new topic hard, until you feel tired, stymied and frustrated. This level of exertion, she added, is associated with increases in the ease of communication within the brain and, as a result, cognitive skills will be enhanced.
Her advice is based on a study of superagers, individuals 65 years or older, whose cognitive skills are as acute as the average 25-year-old.
Barrett believes that what sets superagers apart is their ability to use the unpleasant feelings they experience when challenging themselves as a signal to keep going, rather than as a warning to stop and rest.
Are superagers simply those who ignore, even welcome, the pain and frustration that comes with intense mental effort Or is there some other reason why they spend so much time and effort challenging themselves
This is important, because if the only way to maintain youthful cognitive skills is to expose ourselves regularly to pain and frustration, it doesnt make old age look particularly inviting. The same argument has been put forward with regard to physical ageing. Not long ago, many advocated HIIT  High Intensity Interval Training, exerting yourself to your maximum capacity, interspersing your effort with short periods of rest  as a way to improve cardiovascular function and lose weight.
HIIT does appear to help in this way, as David Swain and Barry Franklin at Old Dominion University in Virginia found. However, many of us find such intense workouts demotivating and, for a few, they may even be dangerous.
Now research is emerging  for example, Dr Jean-Philippe Walhins study at the University of Bath  to suggest that LISS, or Low Intensity Steady State (working out within your aerobic zone) may be just as effective as HIIT for weight loss. Certainly, its more enjoyable.
And enjoyable is the key. If what youre doing is enjoyable, youre more likely to keep working hard at it  probably without even noticing any discomfort.
This is a double win, because research such as Ed Diener and Micaela Chans study at the University of Illinois shows that subjective wellbeing  feeling satisfied with your life and experiencing few if any negative emotions  is associated with better health and a longer life.
Making yourself work until youre exhausted and frustrated holds little appeal. On the other hand, finding an activity you love so much that you dont even notice when youre pushing yourself hard seems a far more attractive way to keep your brain active as you grow older.

Drought hits Anuradhapura
Relief for 24,000 families
Water runs scarce as the drought in the Anuradhapura district prevails. Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that a population of 24,000 of 72,000 families in eight Divisional Secretariat divisions, namely Mahawilachchiya, Nochchiyagama, Nuwaragampalatha (Central), Palugaswewa, Kahatagasdigiliya, Mihintale, Rambewa and Thirappane, were being provided with drinking water with the use of bowsers. He said that the problem would worsen if the district were to not experience rainfall soon.
''We are continuing to provide dry food rations to around 75,000 drought-stricken farmer families and each ration bag being is worth Rs.5,000," he added.
Wanninayake said, "We receive many requests for relief from families alleged to have been affected by the drought and their respective divisional secretaries had been instructed to conduct inquiries and provide assistance to whom it is required."
Referring to the drinking water issue, North Central Province National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NCP-NWSDB) Regional Manager C. S. Lokubarana said that the water level of the main drinking water supply source in Anuradhapura, the Nuwara Wewa, had dropped below the average level of 8 feet to 7.5 feet, making the water treatment process complicated.
Around a population of 300,000 in the Anuradhapura city and its surrounding suburbs, receives drinking water provided by the Nuwara Wewa, Tissa Wewa and Thuruwila tank, amounting to 40 acre-feet per day.
''The Mahaweli Water-Management Committee has been requested to provide a minimum Mahaweli water quota of 5000 a.f. immediately, through the Kala Wewa and the Nachchaduwa tank to the Nuwarawewa tank, to avoid any possible drinking water crisis and we expect that the request would be fulfilled," he said.

Rite redesigned
The large handkerchief lying on the middle links them all. The figures, four in number, are seated in two rows facing each other albeit gazing off into the distance. The figures are connected to each other in a diverse, yet unique, manner. While Othello and Iago sit straight in one row with their back to the audience, their partners, Desdemona and Emilia sit facing the audience.
Sri Lankas audience is well attuned to that name, Othello, though yet to experience Ravibandu Vidyapathys ballet interpretation of the Shakespearean tragedy. Listed as one ballet of a five-day performance organized by the Ravibandu  Samanthi Dance Ensemble, Othello exhibits Ravibandu Vidyapathys eye for finer details. The hairstyles of Emilia and Desdemona are adjusted to suit their class and the creed. Lipstick is adequately used on Desdemona while such makeup is absent on Emilia to enhance the difference of their personalities.
A national manifestation of contemporary art, Ravibandu Vidyapathys latest choreographic effort, an ensemble of five ballet productions, Mudra, will be held from August 20 to 24 at the Lionel Wendt Theatre at 7 pm with the participation of over 200 performing artistes. The festival is held with the aim of promoting and raising awareness of the dance enthusiasts and reviving the modern dance which carries a history of over seven decades to enlighten and encourage the contemporary and future generations.
Mudra festival of dance and oriental ballet celebrates the art of movement and rhythm. The festival will be a glamorous and colourful journey through the world of dance and drums celebrating the work of Sri Lankas master drummer and groundbreaking choreographer, Ravibandu Vidyapathy. The five-day festival will be a rare occasion as the audience will experience an eclectic range of dance and music such as traditional, modern and contemporary choreography, oriental ballet and the dynamic rhythms of Sri Lankan drums.
The modernism of Sri Lankan dance started in the 1940s and reached its zenith in the 1960s. It is now gradually fading off in the mists of commercialisation. Today, there is a dearth of serious or classical dance in the country. This is despite the fact that there is a considerable steam of dance admirers eagerly waiting to witness the traditional, modern or contemporary dance performances, Ravibandu noted.
The fervent attempt of Ravibandu and co is quenching the thirst of this cluster of the dance enthusiasts in order to revive the modern dance. Since their inception in 1982, the Ravibandu  Samanthi Dance Ensemble has built up an enviable reputation for innovation and creative work.
Their unrivalled reputation for the distinctive style of performance and committed ensemble playing was praised the world over. Their performances over two and half decades in some of the worlds prestigious theatres and art venues namely Kennedy Centre, Korea National Theatre, Sadlers Wells Theatre and the WOMAD Music Festivals have won the much public accolade.
The sincerity and excitement of the performers physical presence are what matters seriously for us. The next important step is the unison between the dancer and the audience. We try our best to deal with that subtle sphere of emotion and imagination, Vidyapathy noted.
Ravibandu Vidyapathy is a leading choreographer and dancer in the field of traditional Kandyan dance and oriental ballet. Over the last 35 years, he has produced more than 20 full-length ballets and a number of dance productions.
He developed the traditional drumming into an independent concert art and his contribution to the upliftment of the art of short ballet has been nationally recognized. He is the artistic director and choreographer of the State Dance Ensemble as well.

Festival at a glance
The Rite of Spring
The Rite of Spring is a ballet and orchestral concert work by Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. It was written for the 1913 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilevs Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Vaslav Nijinsky with stage designs and costumes by Nicholas Roerich. When first performed, the avant-garde nature of the music and choreography caused a sensation and a near-riot in the audience. Although designed as a work for the stage, with specific passages accompanying characters and action, the music achieved equal if not greater recognition as a concert piece and is widely considered to be one of the most influential musical works of the 20th century. Vidyapathys rendering is based on the original composition.
Macbeth
The Shakespearean tragedy dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake. Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was a patron of Shakespeares acting company, Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwrights relationship with his sovereign. Professor Pradeep Ratnayake has composed music to Vidyapathys ballet interpretation of the tragedy.
Bahu Ranga
An ensemble of national as well as international drums and music traditions, this will be a novel experience to the local audience.
Charana
A dance combination of upcountry, low country and Sabaragamu dance traditions, this presentation portrays the gradual evolution of Sri Lankas dance.
Othello
A tragedy by William Shakespeare believed to have been written in 1603, the story revolves around its two central characters: Othello, a Moorish general in the Venetian army and his unfaithful ensign, Iago. Given its varied and enduring themes of racism, love, jealousy, betrayal, revenge and repentance, Othello is still often performed in professional and community theatre alike and has been the source for numerous operatic, film and literary adaptations. Jithendra Vidyapathy has composed music to Ravibandus ballet interpretation.

A salute to youth!
Hi there all you youthful guys and gals! Allow me to offer you the felicitations of the world for yesterday, August 12, which has been exclusively dedicated to you. In case you were unaware of what I am talking about let me explain that I am referring to International Youth Day, IYD.
Every year, on this day, the world raises a toast to you as well as raising awareness about issues that affect you. You see, it isnt just a celebration providing you with a chance to change the world but an opportunity to change your life as well. The celebrations spearheaded by the United Nations organises events in most corners of the earth and each year has a designated theme.
This year, the theme of International Youth Day is Safe Spaces for Youth. The United Nations believe that youths need safe spaces where they can come together, getting involved in decision making processes and expressing themselves.
Safe space also ensures their dignity and security in an environment where they are able to involve themselves in healthy activities such as exercise and sports. Providing safe space in many areas is critical for after-school programs in helping young people thrive. Trained staff can do a lot to create a space that is conducive to social and emotional development.
The current generation of youth is the largest in history and young people often comprise the majority in countries marked by armed conflict or unrest. As such considering the needs and aspirations of youth in matters of peace and security is a demographic imperative. Another Security Council Resolution recognises that the scale and challenges of sustaining peace requires partnerships between stakeholders, including youth organisations. It also reaffirms the important role youth can play in deterring and resolving conflicts, and are key constituents in ensuring the success of both peacekeeping and peace building efforts.
Why is everyone expected to care about this day for young people One reason is because there are more youth on the planet than ever before. The UN Population Fund estimates that people inhabiting this earth between the ages of 10 and 24 number 1.8 billion. Now considering your sheer numbers if each of you does something to help your community, just imagine the difference you can make in the world.
It is true that youth unemployment has already been hitting record highs with predictions that the problem will be getting worse. That is why the world is being exhorted to create opportunities for young people to build intellect, skills and confidence. And involving them in debates about local and global issues is more important than ever. That is another reason why the day is reserved for the whole world to be reminded to recognise how brilliant and important young people such as you are to the world.
IYD focuses on the rights of these young people to have full access to education, adequate healthcare, employment opportunities, financial services and full participation in public life. In a climate of economic uncertainty, it is all the more important for countries to invest in opportunities for their youth to learn, earn and grow so that the common future lies in good hands.
It is just one of the many extensive efforts of the UN to help member states reach out to their youth. Along with ensuring their rights, an equally important goal of IYD is to shape the youth not just as a passive beneficiary of development efforts, but as a force for positive social change. They are a source of innovation, creativity, energy and foresight, and all states must use all means possible to foster and harness the power of the youth. These are the ideals of International Youth Day.
No one in his right mind would deny the young their licence to enjoy life to its fullest. After all, it is said that joy is the Fountain of Eternal Youth.
We would have a very jaded younger generation if it has lost its nerve and swerve. Surely we have all been there and have savoured the delights of youthful bliss and elation with an aching nostalgia.
Time was not long ago when adolescence was compounded by excitement and high-spirited capers, all indulged in with a kind of energetic innocence. But for many baby boomers those were spacious times that held a great many values which have eroded with the passage of time. It is also true that in todays world, youth are likely to encounter more ethical and moral temptations, greater spiritual battles, and more emotional and relational struggles than any other generation in history.
You young people are not only our future, you are our present. Our planet has never been so young, with 1.8 billion young women and men. You are the most connected, the most outspoken and the most open-minded generation the world has ever seen.
You are powerful agents of positive change, essential to taking forward the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is not enough to hope for a better tomorrow you must act now. Change is underway, and millions of citizens are already transforming the way we produce, consume, behave and communicate.
There are countless initiatives like this, all giving shape to a new humanism, to new forms of solidarity and citizenship to combat poverty, marginalization and despair.
Everyone appears to be focusing on building on the assets we hold within our own small universe. These include property, machinery, markets and raw materials among other resources, which are all acquirable through artificial sources. Everyone is quick to concentrate on this capital. But if we aim to accomplish any real progress it is imperative that we focus our attention on our youthful human capital, which is the most vital component for the success of any nation.
In Sri Lanka for instance we are in desperate need of an abundance of a well qualified intellectual nucleus to make the country a leading destination for multinationals to outsource their professional services in the fields of accountancy, information technology, medicine, law and banking.
This refers to the potential executive and managerial high-end of the intellectual stratum. But identical priority should be extended to the other level of the dwindling services and labour market which is equally significant if the country is to achieve rapid economic growth in the years to come.
There are also young people whose chances of participating in the human capital formation have been lost due to lack of opportunities to further their educational and vocational skills because of the woeful system of our education. All this meant that a major slice of potential contributors to human capital has gradually diminished.
Optimism and confidence do not mean we minimise the challenges ahead. Most young people live today in least developed countries, and shoulder the heaviest burden of conflicts and poverty. There can be no sustainable development if you remain on the side-lines.

Self-marriage!
Most of us deal with a break up by moping in bed or partying with pals. But Linda Doktar planned to get over a painful split by getting married - to herself!
The Conscious Coach, from the Gold Coast, held an intimate ceremony on the beach on Valentines Day 2017, with only her close friend Ej and two others attending.
She walked herself down a petal-strewn aisle, clutching a bouquet, and then said her vows into a handheld mirror.
Linda said, I thought this was a beautiful concept to symbolise my journey into loving and honouring myself on a deeper level.
Her friend Ej, a relationship coach, first introduced the idea of a self-marriage ceremony as she had previously held some for others, and the idea appealed to Linda. The 34-year-old claims that she used to lead a life of self-loathing, and this ceremony helped her on the journey of spiritual transformation.
The wedding gown was a long white beach dress with some pastel colours running through, and instead of a ring, Linda wore a necklace that symbolised her commitment to herself.
Describing the ceremony, she said, There was a red satin walkway, lined with rose petals and flowers, it was beautiful. As the ceremony progressed, I read my vows and commitments out loud to myself, while looking into a hand-held mirror.
The attractive Aussie smiles when she looks back at her ceremony, as it reminds her of a turning point in her life where she decided to connect to deeper levels of self-love.
Linda wanted to confirm that this commitment she has to herself and says her happiness doesnt mean that shes closing herself off to relationships with other people.
She added, I believe that the most important relationship I will ever have is with myself. I know and understand that the quality of the relationship we have with ourselves determines the quality of experiences we have with others.
Whilst some have laughed at Lindas decision, she claims that most have thought it was a beautiful concept and that it was received with love and an open mind.

SLFPers wanting to become Independent MPs should contest election separately - Duminda
MPs who entered Parliament by contesting elections under the SLFP or UPFA ticket cannot become independent members now. SLFPers who wish to become Independent can do so by contesting separately at the next election, SLFP National Organiser and Irrigation and Water Resources Management and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
Although a section of UPFA members had crossed over to the Opposition when the party was working within the government, their claim to be independent was invalid, he said.
Minister Dissanayake was speaking to the media after calling on the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chief Prelates at their respective Aramayas in Kandy to brief them on the forthcoming Yala harvesting festival.
The harvesting festival is organised by the Irrigation Ministry for the third corrective year after receiving the blessings of the Cheif Prelates on August 12.
Dissanayake who said that certain sections were clamouring for the Opposition Leaders post after citing the case where Nimal Siripala de Silva held the post for sometime, added that a once committed historical wrong could not be repeated and taken as an example.
He said Parliamentarian Dilan Perera always had problems with the President rather than with him (Dissanayake). When Perera could not tell anything directly to the President he blamed him (Dissanayake). People did not take the statements that Dilan Perera seriously. He (Perera) had even allegedly threatened to drink poison on behalf of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He said the SLFP and President Maithripala Sirisena would lead the country even after 2020.

SLTDA license pre-requisite for loans to tourism businesses - CBSL
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka(CBSL) has directed all finance companies in the country to consider the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authoritys (SLTDA) license as a pre-requisite for granting loans to any tourism related business.
In a letter to Krishan Thilakaratne, the Chairman of the Finance Houses Association of Sri Lanka, the Central Bank says under the Tourism Act No. 38 of 2005, it is mandatory for all tourism related businesses in the country to register with the SLTDA before commencing business operations.
This provision has been introduced to maintain the quality and standards to protect the countrys reputation as a travel destination, the letter said.
It also added that there were many tourism businesses operating in the country without license from the SLTDA.
The SLTDA has also had discussions with the Central Bank to ensure that the commercial banks too consider the SLTDA license as a pre-requisite for granting loans to tourism related businesses. The SLTDA recently set up an Enforcement Unit to bring unregistered tourism related business establishments in Sri Lanka into the regulatory framework of the SLTDA through registration.
In addition, the SLTDA is in the process of setting up countrywide committees to expedite the data collection process and submit a full report covering all districts to the Enforcement Unit.
SLTDA also launched Online Tourism Business Licensing System (OTBLS) last year to further facilitate tourism business license issuance and renewal processes. At the same time, the SLTDA has deployed a new cyber tool to track accommodation providers operating without valid licence from the institution.
This tool scans publicly available online data about tourism businesses and cross-checks them with the Business Licensing Platform run by the state tourism authority.
The SLTDA is the governing body of Sri Lanka Tourism and the replacement of the Sri Lanka Tourist Board.

Sourav Ganguly likely to become next BCCI President
Former BCCI head Anurag Thakurs plea for impeachment with the Honourable Supreme Court (SC) over the latters previous decision to control the boards administration using a tight set of reins, the SC went on to add a cooling-off clause as amendment for current and past administrators of the Indian Cricket Board.
And that has inadvertently paved the way for a likely possibility of Sourav Ganguly becoming the next BCCI president.
The Supreme Court decided to set aside some of the recommendations of the panel led by retd. Justice R.M.Lodha, and also approved a new draft constitution that could force the BCCI to look at getting a former Indian cricketer at the helm of affairs.
Ganguly, who currently serves as the president of the Cricket Association of Bengal, would be eligible for the BCCI presidential role if he gave up on his current task at hand.
And unlike previous times, he would not need a cool-off period before he can contest for the same.
The BCCI has been in the limelight for all the wrong reasons, such as corruption, improper administration, and so on.
Gangulys arrival at the top of the institution could effectively be of help for it to regain its goodwill among the cricketing fraternity.

No one can challenge the decision of the Speaker on the post of Opposition Leader, House and Sate Enterprise Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
Kiriella was addressing the media at the Pushpadana Hall, Kandy on August 10. He said that it is explicitly stated in a ruling given by the late Anura Bandaranike as the former Speaker.
Anura Bandaranaike's ruling stated that a decision made by Parliament could not be contested in courts.
Minister Kirella said the Speaker had made the correct decision on the Post of Opposition Leader.
The accepted tradition is to offer the Post of Opposition Leader to the party with the majority of members in the opposition sitting as one group.
The so called joint opposition was only a clique and granting the post of opposition leader to a clique was not the parliamentary tradition.
He said the 'Phottuwa party' was engineering a wave of strikes in the country. Its ulterior motive was to block foreign investments and destabilise the government, he said.

The possibility of developing abdominal obesity is 26.2 percent," she said.
"According to the survey conducted in Sri Lanka in 2015, 23.9 percent of the Sri Lankans between the ages of 18 and 69 are over weight. The same survey showed that 5.9 percent of Sri Lankan adult population suffer from obesity," she explained.
Preventing abdominal fat getting collected reduces the risk of developing several diseases. Taking more food with high level of fat and carbohydrate and being idle lead to increase of abdominal fat.

According to prominent Endocrinologist and Diabotologist Dr. Noel Somasundaram, the impact of being over weight on diabetic patients is significant. One of the important steps to reduce complications of diabetes is to lose weight if one is overweight or obese. Weight loss has multiple benefits. Insulin resistance and resulting inflammation improve when weight is lost and tissue injury that results from inflammation can be reduced. Weight loss also results in improvement of glucose , blood pressure and lipid levels as well as reduce the underlying problems in diabetes such as inflammation, tendency for blood to clot easily resulting in heart attack (pro-coagulation state). Weight loss in early diabetes can even cure diabetes. Weight loss also improves quality of life and should be attempted as early as possible.

Tigers mind on PGA shootout birdies, not 15th major win
ST. LOUIS Aug12: Tiger Woods wouldn't even contemplate how it would feel to win his 15th major title, his first in more than a decade, after leaping into contention at the PGA Championship.
The 42-year-old former world number one fired a four-under-par 66 in Saturday's third round at Belleville Country Club to share sixth on eight-under 202, four back of leader Brooks Koepka after 54 holes.
A long way to go before that happens, Woods said when asked about a 15th major title. I've got to shoot a low round tomorrow and hopefully it will be enough. Eight months into his comeback from spinal fusion surgery, Woods has shown moments of the form that once dominated the sport. And while he draws huge crowds, he hasn't won a major since the 2008 US Open or any event in five years.
Woods birdied five of his first eight holes but closed with 10 pars and while he has never won a major he didn't lead after 54 holes, he has battled on enough Sundays to know what he must do on a back nine where he's shooting only two-over par this week.
Not just myself, but everyone's going to have to shoot low rounds, Woods said. It's soft, it's gettable and you can't just go out there and make a bunch of pars. You're going to have to make some birdies. Woods, whose back pain was so bad he once wondered if he might ever have a normal life much less play golf again, was thrilled at his birdie binge early. It was fun. I got off to a good start, he said. That was nice to be able to do something like that.
I just wish I could have got myself a couple more shots closer to the lead... but there aren't a lot of guys up there in front of me. Koepka stands one stroke ahead of Australia's Adam Scott with Americans Gary Woodland and Rickie Fowler and Spain's Jon Rahm two adrift. Playing partner Stewart Cink, the 2009 British Open winner who matched Woods on 66 and 202, marveled at what he saw as a vintage Woods performance.
I didn't really feel like there was a difference at all, Cink said. It just felt like all that I remembered playing with Tiger all those years, you know, when he was winning tournaments. It was really no different. The 14 majors won by Woods rank second on the all-time list to the record 18 won by Jack Nicklaus. And Woods has 79 career PGA victories, three shy of Sam Snead's all-time record.

Twenty five new Tourist Police stations to be established - IGP
IGP Pujith Jayasundara said 25 new Tourist Police stations would be established across the country to ensure the safety of tourists.
The IGP made this assurance during a meeting held with the Chairman and senior officials of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) and the officers of the Tourist Police Division, at the Police Headquarters in Colombo, on Friday.
At the meeting, the IGP also said a new uniform would be introduced to the Tourist Police Division, allowing it to build more cordial relations with the tourists visiting Sri Lanka.
The new Police stations will be constructed with the instance of the SLTDA and they will be strategically positioned covering all main tourist destinations in the country.
We have to understand the important role played by the tourism sector in the countrys economy. In a few years, it is expected to become the largest foreign exchange earner for the country. Therefore, ensuring safety of the foreigners visiting Sri Lanka will be a top priority for the Police force, the IGP said.
He also added that measures would be made to give more training opportunities to officers attached to the Tourist Police Division.
Officers of the Tourist Police Division should pay special attention to language training. In addition to English, they should also learn widely used international languages such as Chinese, Hindi and French, the IGP said, while promising to expand training opportunities to the Tourist Police.
Members of the Tourist Police Force, the IGP said, must work closely with the SLTDA and other institutions involved in the Tourism sector. At the same time, the Tourist Police Division should be a brand by itself adding value to Sri Lankas reputation as a safe destination, IGP Jayasundara said.
Speaking on behalf of the SLTDA, its Chairman Kavan Ratnayaka said the state tourism institution would extend its maximum support to the Tourist Police Division, as protecting tourists is a key priority for the government and the SLTDA would go to any length to achieve it.

UKs NHS performs life-saving surgery on Lankan
The UKs National Health Service (NHS) gets a lot of flak in the British press and on social media, but for two Sri Lankan tourists, the NHS proved to be a god-send on a recent trip.
Subash and Sriyani, a husband and wife duo en route to Sri Lanka from the US, decided to stay over at a friends house in London for a few days. They came to London to July 10 and that very night, Sriyani developed a terrible pain in her urinary tract, with difficulty in passing urine. They tried various herbal and off-the-shelf medications to alleviate the pain over the next day, but nothing seemed to work.
Then on July 12, their friend suggested they visit the nearby NHS Northwick Park Hospital located in Harrow, Middlesex. They went there around 5 pm and Consultant Urologist Dr. David Manson-Bahr recommended some tests and scans. The tests were done that same afternoon and the scan was scheduled for July 13.
When the scan results came back, the doctor told us the prognosis was not good; Sriyani had developed a kidney stone, which caused the pain. The recommendation was to insert a stent to reduce the pain and ensure the flow of urine, recalled Subash.
Luckily, they had worldwide travel insurance. The insurer had earlier assured that genuine claims would be promptly settled, so the financial aspect of the surgery would be taken care of. But the only problem was that the clock was ticking; it was already Friday afternoon in London. Repeated calls to the insurer went unanswered. When at last someone answered, they were told that the claim could be processed only the following week, when the office reopened again. As for cash, they just did not have enough to cover a surgery of such scale.
We were desperate. She could not bear the pain any longer, so we thought of flying back to Sri Lanka that night. We implored the surgeon to give her some painkillers for the journey and allow her to fly, Subash said.
Dr. Bahr took me to a side and explained that it would not be possible. He explained that no airline would let her board and even if that were managed, if something happened mid-air, the plane would divert to the nearest airport and offload the passenger to the nearest hospital. We might have to bear the cost of the diversion as well, he added.
Subash and Sriyani were at their wits end, unable to fathom what should be done.
I will see what I can do, Dr. Bahr told the couple and went in to his consultation chambers. He emerged around 30 minutes later and said, You do not have to worry anymore. I had a chat over the telephone with my boss to explain the situation and he agreed that we should do the surgery free of charge immediately, he said.
Once we regained our composure, I stammered and said doctor, you do not have to do that; we will somehow manage till Monday, Subash told the Daily News. It was Dr. Bahrs turn to reply:
Trust me on this, we are going to do this. You can worry about the money later.
With those words, the patient was immediately wheeled into the theatre where the surgery was completed in less than an hour. After a days observation, she was discharged and deemed fit enough to fly. Additional medication was provided for use during the flight home. The couple returned to Sri Lanka the next day.
They had since undergone further treatment at a local hospital where doctors had praised the UKs NHS Hospital for their quick thinking and generous offer. We are deeply indebted to Dr. Bahr, Dr. Anish Patel, their superiors, the hospital staff and the Government of the UK, for the courtesy extended to us during our time of need. We do not know what would have happened if they did not take the decision to operate for free at the time.
It was a deeply moving experience which we will never forget, Subash added. Since then, Sriyani has had additional treatment and made a complete recovery, marking a happy end to a tale that could have ended on a very different note, if not for the timely intervention of a British doctor who adhered to the Hippocratic Oath in letter and in spirit.

Without Google, Facebook or Twitter
Wei Dilong, 18, who lives in the southern Chinese city of Liuzhou, likes basketball, hip-hop music and Hollywood superhero movies. He plans to study chemistry in Canada when he goes to college in 2020.
Mr. Wei is typical of Chinese teenagers in another way, too: He has never heard of Google or Twitter. He once heard of Facebook, though. It is maybe like Baidu he asked one recent afternoon, referring to Chinas dominant search engine.
Foreign websites
A generation of Chinese is coming of age with an internet that is distinctively different from the rest of the web. Over the past decade, China has blocked Google, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, as well as thousands of other foreign websites, including The New York Times and Chinese Wikipedia. A plethora of Chinese websites emerged to serve the same functions  though they came with a heavy dose of censorship.
Now the implications of growing up with this different internet system are starting to play out. Many young people in China have little idea what Google, Twitter or Facebook are, creating a gulf with the rest of the world. And, accustomed to the homegrown apps and online services, many appear uninterested in knowing what has been censored online, allowing Beijing to build an alternative value system that competes with Western liberal democracy.
These trends are set to spread. China is now exporting its model of a censored internet to other countries, including Vietnam, Tanzania and Ethiopia.
Such outcomes are the opposite of what many in the West anticipated would be the effect of the internet. In a 2000 speech, President Bill Clinton argued that the internets growth would make China a more open society like the United States. In the new century, liberty will spread by cellphone and cable modem, he said.
For American and other Western internet giants, the hope of getting a piece of the huge China market is increasingly a pipe dream. Chinas Communist Party has demonstrated clearly that it will walk down a path of tighter ideological control under President Xi Jinping. In the first half of this year, the internet regulator Cyber Administration of China said it had shut down or revoked the licenses of more than 3,000 websites.
Approval withdrawn
Yet American internet giants are still trying. Google has been working on a censored search engine for Chinas smartphone users in case the government lets it in. And last month, Facebook gained approval to open a subsidiary in the eastern province of Zhejiang  only to see the approval quickly withdrawn.
Even if the Western apps and sites make it into China, they may face apathy from young people.
Two economists from Peking University and Stanford University concluded this year, after an 18-month survey, that Chinese college students were indifferent about having access to uncensored, politically sensitive information. They had given nearly 1,000 students at two Beijing universities free tools to bypass censorship, but found that nearly half the students did not use them.
Among those who did, almost none spent time browsing foreign news websites that were blocked. Our findings suggest that censorship in China is effective not only because the regime makes it difficult to access sensitive information, but also because it fosters an environment in which citizens do not demand such information in the first place, the scholars wrote.
Zhang Yeqiong, 23, a customer service representative at an e-commerce company in Xinji, a small city a few hours drive from Beijing, echoed that sentiment. I grew up with Baidu, so Im used to it, she said.
The attitude is a departure even from those born in China in the 1980s. When that generation was coming of age a decade or so ago, some were rebels. One of the most famous was Han Han, a blogger who questioned the Chinese political system and traditional values.
He sold millions of copies of books and has more than 40 million followers on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. - New York Times

The Incredible Wild, an exhibition of a selection of Sri Lankas awe-inspiring wild-life photographs will be held at the Lionel Wendt Gallery, on September 1 and 2. This collection of large format fine art prints showcases intimate encounters with some of the most splendid specimens of local wild-life and is bound to satiate any wildlife enthusiast.
The man behind the lens, Riznad Hussain, is an avid wild-life enthusiast and has spent the past 8 years, in absolute patience, to capture these stunning photographs. Although a Marketer by profession, Riznad is happiest in the jungle with a camera in hand, indulging in and capturing natural wild-life in all its glory.
He sees his photography as a medium to raise awareness on the importance of conservation; Most of us are so caught up with our busy, urban lives that we often forget the magnificence of the nature around us. Worse, there are so many things we do to destroy nature, without even realizing it. But Im hoping that when you look at my photos youll be reminded of how beautiful and diverse our wild-life is. How breath-taking the animals are, no matter how big or small they are. And Im hoping people will be moved to being proactive in protecting and conserving our wildlife before irreparable damage is done, states Hussain.
He added, this exhibition is essentially a tribute to the wonders of Sri Lankas wild-life and tells the story of my experience with the glorious and charismatic animals Ive encountered, including leopards, bears, elephants and birds. Its been a truly gratifying endeavour and I am excited to share my experiences through my photography.
Though this is Riznads maiden exhibition, his photography has gained recognition across many international platforms including BBC Earths Instagram handle.

Degree not needed to work for masses
The UDA has to cater to more than 22,000 houses and 25,000 families numbering over 100,000 people. So it needs men and material to undertake the required work. A person need not have a degree to work with the people. What is needed is the will and dedication to render service to the people, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The Minister was speaking in reply to a statement made by Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila questioning the qualifications and credentials of project directors, advisors and coordinating officers of the UDA.
Minister Ranawaka said the last regime ran the UDA by appointing military officers to its posts. Today, the Ministry needed more employees to render a proper service through the UDA. A degree was not essential to work with the masses. For that matter, neither did Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike nor Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake have degrees, but they rendered colossal service to the people.
The two people mentioned by Gammanpila served under him when he was provincial minister, but their educational qualifications did not bother Gammanpila at that time, he said.
Even Dinesh Gunawardene was aware that Architect Prasanna Silva who was Director General of the UDA during the previous regime, was jailed for one-and-a-half years because of false charges made against him. Another person called Gnanapala was chased out for disrespecting the Director General by talking to him with his hands in his pockets, Minister Ranawaka said.
Perhaps Gammanpila feels jealous to see UDA work progressing smoothly without strikes and protests to make such wild accusations, he said.

He said the Forest Conservation Department will soon physically demarcate the boundaries of the mountain range. He said the original plan of the conservation forest already has it and only a physical marking, such as erecting ranging poles has to be carried out.
Environmentalists and activists had raised concerns recently over an allegation that an illegal land grab backed by politicians were going on at the Knuckles mountain range.
Ratnaweera said any issue with the Knuckles range will be resolved after demarcating the land.

He said prices of 25 drugs including cancer drugs will be reduced before long. The All island Private Pharmacy Owners Association does not charge people unreasonably while private pharmacies earn profit, he said.
Minister Senaratne said the cap on the limit of funds that the State spends on cancer patients was lifted and earlier it was Rs. 1.5 million. The government now spend around Rs. 450 million on a cancer patient. The health sector has received 43 private sector investments, the Minister said.
High prices of 48 drugs were slashed in the past and that immensely benefited the public. The National drug Policy was introduced after discussing it for over four decades.

Rajapaksas using every card to destabilise yahapalana govt.
A cluster of problems has arisen because of the political ambitions of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. If he expects the honour of winning the war, he should also accept the responsibility for all destruction, said SLFP national organiser and Irrigation Minister Duminda Dissanayake, addressing the media following a SLFP meeting in Anuradhapura recently.
The Minister said Mahinda Rajapaksa was hoisted to the apex position in politics by the people and he did wrong by remaining in politics for too long.
There has been a wave of strikes now. Railway employees should remember that they are not facing any financial discrepancy, but a problem related to their positions in the service, the Minister said. I appeal to all those planning to launch unwarranted, unreasonable and politically motivated strikes to avoid any uprising of the public whom they are provoking by resorting to strike action. He said that the time has come for the public to get the justice for their problems, if those problems are created by any agency purely on a political agenda.
The Opposition is always trying hard to use every card possible to gain power into their hands through any means.
That is why they are vehemently and unreasonably working against the yahapalana government following cheap political strategies and hoodwinking and misguiding people, including state employees, over incidents such as the death of a person or a natural disaster.
Recently Samurdhi officers launched a strike. The former minister Basil Rajapaksa dragged these officers into difficulty. They were recruited in 1994. But so far no appointment letters have been issued or pension scheme created. I request the Samurdhi officers not to allow their trade union leaders to hoodwink them.
If the Rajapaksha regime genuinely wanted to settle the Samurdhi officers grievances, they could have done so before their defeat in 2015, by granting the legal privileges and rights to Samurdhi officers whose posts they created, the Minister said.

Aitken Spence 1Q PBT down 29%
Aitken Spence PLC reported a drop of 29.3 per cent pre-tax profit from Rs. 678 million to Rs. 480 million, over the previous year.
The Companys financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2018 reported the revenue for the first quarter decreasing by 9.2 per cent from Rs. 11.6 billion to Rs. 10.6 billion.Despite the impact of the exchange rates and increase in costs, revenue from the tourism sector remained strong as in the previous year rising by 4.7 percent to Rs. 4.9 billion. The revenue increased across Sri Lanka, the Maldives and India markets while Oman reported a reduction.
However, the tourism sector reported a loss of Rs. 262 million for the quarter, which is an increase from Rs. 150 million, over the previous year. Lower occupancy in the Maldivian resorts and a lack of significant improvement in occupancy levels in Sri Lankan hotels contributed towards the losses. India performance improved, with better occupancy and banquet sales at Turyaa Chennai. Performance from Aitken Spence Travels during the quarter remained steady over the corresponding period last year.
Maritime & logistics and services sectors recorded increments. The maritime and logistics sector revenue increased by 12 per cent from Rs.1.9 billion to Rs.2.2 billion, driven by an improved contribution from the freight, courier and shipping agency businesses. The quarterly profit-before-tax of the maritime and logistics sector increased by 17.4 per cent to Rs. 436 million, over the previous year.
The first quarter services sector revenue increased by 32 per cent from Rs.387 million to Rs. 513 million, while profit-before-tax rose by 1.8 per cent to Rs. 82 million over the previous year, driven mainly by property and elevators segments. Major expenses were incurred on the construction of Heritance Aarah resort, in the Maldives and the 10 MW waste-to-energy power plant in north of Colombo. The construction of Heritance Aarah is expected to open in the Maldives by the end of 2018. Heritance Aarah will be the first resort outside Sri Lanka to be branded as Heritance. The landmark waste-to-energy project is expected help solve both the waste disposal and energy supply challenges in the country at present. The project would be equipped to convert municipal solid waste to electricity, aimed at greatly relieving the Colombo City of its waste disposal burden.

ANC school of postgraduate, UWL launch EMBA program
ANC School of Postgraduate Education, in collaboration with the University of West London (UWL) of UK, launched the Executive MBA (EMBA) program at the Movenpick Hotel, Colombo recently.
This tailor-made program is expected to offer both prestige and career advancement for aspiring executives of corporates from Sri Lanka and across South Asia.
To earn the EMBA, students will complete five modules, Management Skills for Executives, Strategic Leadership, Technology and Global Economy, Financial Management and Delivering Innovation Project.
We are excited to introduce this innovative program designed in line with the worlds top Executive MBAs such as Harvard and INSEAD Executive MBAs, allowing busy executives to achieve their career goals within a shorter period of time-5 weekends of in-class learning plus E-learning and completion in one year-at an affordable cost, said Dr. Punarjeeva Karunanayake, the Chief Executive Officer of ANC Education.
The executive learner is at the heart of this programme. The UWL EMBA curriculum and teaching design is the result of decades of research and experience delivering high impact management education through better integration of formal learning into the real world. This programme effectively bridges the gap between theory and practice by engaging the executive in a continuous process that encourages application and innovative thinking, said Dr. Suresh Gamlath, Dean of Business at the University of West London.
The program combines in-class discussions with online learning materials and lectures, online discussion forums and library facilities. A study pack has also been developed to support learning along with personal tutoring sessions via the online learning platform. Our faculty members have real-world experience at a top management level and bring that knowledge and expertise to classroom, said Marcelline Alexander, the Academic Head of business programs at ANC.

Andre Russells amazing dual-feat in the Caribbean PL
Most players aspire to be of some help within their squad while featuring in a game. We admit that it feels pretty nice to have contributed to a teams win, no matter how small the contribution may have been.
On the other side of this, we have Andre Russell now who reached the apex of what anyone would have thought as doable in a T20 cricket match - and how! A 40-ball-ton, a last-over hat-trick, and a splendid catch. It is even safe to say that one may feel a tad bit sorry for the rest of the side out there - having not done as much as the man alone, even collectively.
The Trinbago Knight Riders looked strong, despite losing a dangerous Chris Lynn to a brilliant Russell catch. They went on to post 225/6 in 20 overs, which would have gone even higher, had Russell not produced a spectacular effort in the final over - dismissing Brendon McCullum, Darren Bravo and Denesh Ramdin in successive balls to finish the hat-trick.
All was not well, even then as Russells Jamaica Tallawahs fell to 41/5 while chasing the huge score. That was when he came in to bat. Very soon, he blitzed his way through, completing a hundred in 40 balls and scoring 21 more in 9 more balls, as he successfully guided his side to an amazing win.
The mammoth knock featured 6 fours and 13 sixes, as he became the only second T20 player after Joe Denly to achieve the twin-feat of a hundred and a hat-trick in the same game. No prizes for guessing the man-of-the-match.

[APPRECIATIONS - (13-08-2018)]
Prof. Uditha Liyanage
Guiding light
Three years have passed by since the demise of my mentor Prof. Uditha Liyanage. A lot had been said about this legendary marketting sage since his untimely departure in August, 2015. The Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM) had posthumously published his final contribution Consumer Strategy in 2016.
We renamed the PIM library as the Prof. Uditha Liyanage Memorial Library last year. In 2018, we would launch the Prof. Uditha Liyanage Memorial Oration as an annual event. My attempt is not to repeat his accolades, but to share my experiences of being influenced by this wonderful human being. Professor Uditha Liyanage was an invaluable instructor, inspirer and an influencer to for me. Let me share some such reminiscent memories. He was my marketting teacher at the Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM). As an engineer who had never done marketting, I developed a flavour for it during my MBA studies, thanks to him.
The way he generated interest in us not only for concepts, but also for applications, was remarkable. He often advocated us to be brilliant in basics. The way he delivered a session was quite interactive and informative, as he firmly believed in chalk and talk. This was the case with numerous topics in Strategic Marketting, Marketting Communication, Consumer Behaviour, Research, Business Strategy and Policy. Of course, he had PowerPoint slides, not with mere points, but powerful ones. He always challenged us by asking what is the point
We had to be clear about the central theme or the main argument. Once he became the Director, he recommended us to use four modes of teaching, namely tell, ask, do and show. His view was that during a three-hour lecture, the telling should not be more than one-third. The rest should be asking questions, carrying out activities such as case studies as well as showing videos followed by discussions. We felt the variety and versatility of his endavours through all this. Prof. Liyanage insisted on the understanding and application of managerial topics. He gave us a challenge: be confident in sharing key learning points in your own words with your teenage son or daughter, in a manner that they would understand. That requires clarity and commitment.
He suggested us to use a switch on, switch off approach. Switch on is when you are in complete focus with attentive concentration. Switch off means to relax and unwind. A healthy blend of both is necessary in effectively grasping knowledge. Developing teaching models was one of his key initiatives. A simple Google search would amply justify the popularity of those models in relation to marketting and strategy. Liyanage Value Pyramid, Liyanage 10 S Strategic Marketting Planning Framework and Liyanage Strategy Quadrant are some such models that became useful for management learners. These authentic models made his sessions enriching and also showcased the power of Sri Lankan thinking that is second to none.
Prof. Liyanage inspired me in many fronts. He stood tall in front of all of us. As a sought-after marketting scholar, a strategic management thinker, an exceptional academic, a thought-provoking teacher and a visionary leader, he was a guiding light for to us. I saw him rendering yeoman service in multiple ways in raising the PIM flag higher. His exemplary character and competence were evident in the manner he contributed to socio-economic upliftment as a great human being.
We at PIM, in fact, had been privileged not only to associate with him, but to be inspired by him as well. He shared criticisms against MBAs by the CEOs and insisted that PIM MBAs should be different. Thus came the slogan, Do not just do an MBA, but be an MBA.
The process of learning and ones exposure to education must be continuous. There is much more to be known and that which you know may no longer be valid. This had been Prof. Liyanages advice. He shared with us articles, web-links and books that were of high relevance to sharpening our managerial skills. I still remember how he shared an article on Nishkam Karma (detached involvement) written by a Prof. Chakraborty from the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore.
Prof. Liyanage was interested in knowing my reflections on it and it took time for me to realise the value of such gestures. Moreover, I see the value of detached involvement as a leader thanks to him. I saw the blossoming of transformational leadership at PIM with Prof. Liyanage. He influenced all of us to raise the quality and relevance of all modules we deliver. Our business is mastery, he often said. PIM brings the reward of outstanding results to those professional managers who strive towards mastery. Thats how he influenced the aspiring learners of PIM.
Converting practitioners to professionals with character and competence had been our endavour.
PIM had always been a centre of excellence in management education with its winds spreading beyond Sri Lanka. Much of the credit should go to Prof. Liyanage for elevating it even higher. PIM is proud of being a self-financed, semi-autonomous public entity. It was under his leadership that we became the first public sector higher education institute to obtain the ISO 9000: 2008 quality standards. He influenced us to change for the better.
Through his famous mod-tradi consumer model, he encouraged us to strike a balance between traditions and technology. I still remember how he insisted on using more practical examples in discussing a theory than being overly theoretical and neglecting practice. He showed us through his innovative teaching approaches, as to how we should maintain depth. Prof. Liyanage compared PIM to a temple and often suggested that the work we do have high spiritual value. He encouraged us to give more than we get with regard to rewards. Having left a lucrative multinational career in becoming an academic, this lesson was soothing for me.
He cautioned me to strike the needed balance between knowledge-creation and knowledge-sharing when I was having an over-demand for training and consultancy. A research role, though not financially-rewarding, is of extreme use for a management academic. I learnt how to be a multiple role-player with balance and brilliance, thanks to him.
Life is not only to live, but to leave a legacy. Prof. Liyanage had aptly done that during his life.
As Abraham Lincoln said, It is not the years in life that matter, but the life in years. This was very true of Prof. Liyanage. We at PIM commit ourselves to carry his legacy forward. I am humbly happy to lead a learning community in such a noble endavour.
Goodbye my beloved instructor, inspirer and influencer. May you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.
Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri,
PIM Director

Beloved father
You were born on August 16, 1894,In the staunchly Catholic village of Kalamulla,The little Vatican of Kalutara,Dotted with five churches built on the coastline,You were educated at Holy Cross College, Kalutara,The only Catholic boys school situated between Moratuwa and Galle,Keeping its flag flying high to date,With its sister-school Holy Family Convent situated close by,August 16, on your birthday,It would have been a truly momentous day,If you had lived to date,But God thought otherwise,On this day,You would surely be looking down at me from heaven,As I recollect the way we were brought up in life, step by step,And the deeds of a beloved father,Life was always a hard struggle for you,I can still remember those difficult times,Sorrows and worries, obstacles and setbacks,You had them all in plenty,During your young days, being duty-conscious,You had waited and waited,Until your elder sister walked down the aisle,Before taking the all-important step in your own life,Your never had a chance,To own a house of your own,Living in rented houses was the norm of the day,But you never tried to own them,Through legal or illegal means,As a devoted father,And as the head of a loving family,You braved them all,With clean principles and faith in God,You fed us, clothed us and educated us,You looked after us in sicknesses and injuries,You did all that with what you had,As a monthly pay from civil medical stores,How you managed to do so much with so little,Is still a mystery to me!You never had a bank account in your name,You never tried to earn a single Rupee in an unjust way,You never owed anyone a single Rupee either,And you taught me by practice,How to live within ones meansAnd that money is not everything in lifeYou were firm in your decisions,You were not a silent spectator,In the face of lies or injustice,You feared no one in this world,You feared only God,And, a moment before you clutched Gods hand,On January 24, 1993, at the age of 98,You would have felt contended to think,That you had brought up three daughters and a son,To what they were on that date,With your sweat, toil and sacrifice,Now it is my turn to to do better,And to pave a path for my son and two daughters,To reach greater heights in society,A wish so dear to your heartA struggle I have to win,To instill in you again and again,That you certainly had a son,Worthy to carry your surname,Whom you named Srilal
Your only son,Srilal Jayasuriya

Beta Pereira
Exceptional human being
At the very outset, let me say that it is not usual for a son to write an appreciation of his mother. But then, my mother was an exceptional human being, at least to my two siblings Leilani and Pravin as well as myself.
She lived to the ripe old age of 99, exceeding the Psalmists score by almost three decades. To the three of us, she was everything and more that a mother could ever be. Even long after my formative years, she was the one I always turned to and relied on. When I exceeded my weekly allowance, I could rely on her for a little something to tide me over until the next installment and nary a word to my papa.
My papa, being the martinet he was, was very strict about what he doled out to his three children . Come birthdays and family outings, it was our mum who came out with ideas and planning: trips to the Gampaha Gardens, Victoria Park as well as moonlight dinners at the Lighthouse on Marine Drive. She was the one who always ensured that there was a jolly bomb at my sister Leilanis birthdays in December. Her culinary expertise were well-known and my cousins still smack their lips when they talk about her cheese straws, cream buns, the Portuguese delicacy bolo folhado, and the South Indian payasam and kesari.
Her Sunday afternoon desserts were especially delicious and we the family could choose our favourite dessert in rotation, my being the honeycomb mould pudding. Her skills extended to sewing, foreign languages and music as well. My paternal aunt Niru used to tell us that she had sewn for four generations of my fathers family.
She was quite adept at keyboards and our home used to waft to the tunes of Chopsticks and The Maidens Prayer.
Despite her mild disposition and diminutive size, she could be quite formidable when the occasion warranted it and woe betide the butcher who short-changed her on a joint of beef or if the dhoby brought back her precious dorcas bed sheets frayed! She was also a live-wire of the Bambalapitiya Holy Family Convent Old Girls Association and played a good game of tennis in a (half-sari) at the Bambalapitiya Catholic Association.
Mum had her share of idiosyncrasies too: bent forks and knives and talking to herself whilst washing the dishes. She also had this uncanny knack of getting along with people. In fact, it was a standard joke at home that when my paternal grandmother used to visit us at home, she spent more time with her daughter-in-law than with her son. Even at this advanced age of mine, what wouldnt I give to be tucked into bed at night one more time listening to her narration of Jack and Bean Stalk as well as lullabies such as Kiss Me Goodnight, Sergeant Major and The Good Ship Lollipop, and for a touch of those soft-gnarled hands and that distinctive whiff of 4711 Eau de Cologne on her being as well as the rustle of her housecoat and her warm, endearing smile.She riseth with the dawn
She eateth not the bread of idlenessShe opens her mouth with wisdomHer words are the law of kindlinessHer children rise up and call her blessed.- Proverbs 31

William Henry Samaranayake
Dedicated educationist
With the passing of William Henry Samaranayake, retired Principal of St. Bernadettes College, Polgahawela, in 1969, the country lost a great educationist and silent social worker, whose activities were directed to the welfare of students.
Many of them rose to power and distinction. When Samaranayake took over St. Bernadettes College, it had only a few cadjan huts to house students. Samaranayakes courage and perseverance helped produce magnificent buildings which house the college even today. Samaranayake was not only a man of an unassuming disposition; he also had dignity without pride.
He was calm and collected and was a gentleman par excellence. Samaranayake belonged to an age which is fast-sliding into history, but he successfully accomplished his tasks, reaching eminence in diverse fields. His philanthropic genius enabled many an underprivileged to bask in the radiance of his warmhearted munificence and acts of generosity. Educationists of Samaranayakes stamp, mettle and genius are indeed today, rare as sandalwood trees that adorn the jungles of Sri Lanka.
William Henry Samaranayake will long be remembered as a great educationist who disciplined and moulded students to be respectful towards their parents, elders and the state.
The students who occupy positions of dignity in the nation today, owe a great deal to Samaranayake. He was also a prolific writer to the press and his articles were directed towards creating public opinion. Three great positions worthy of human ambition are to be the ruler of a great nation, the principal of a great school or the author of a great book.
Samaranayake was not only the principal of that great school, St. Bernadettes College, but he was also the author of four great books: English with a Smile 1, English with a Smile 2 and English with a Smile 3 as well as Practical English, which is almost a vade mecum and a sine qua non to English students in Sri Lanka. W. H. Samaranayake has been laid to rest, but he would live forever in his books, which as text books in Sri Lankan schools, had been and would continue to be, invaluable guides to generations of teachers as well as students for years beyond our ken.
The world had lost a great educationist who was distinguished for his simplicity as well as his high sense of duty and integrity. His 49th death anniversary falls on August 26, 2018. His 112th birth anniversary falls on November 26, 2018.
