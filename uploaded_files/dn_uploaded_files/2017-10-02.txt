100-foot bamboo Durga idol stakes claim for Guinness Book
An over 100-foot tall Durga idol is attracting pandal hoppers from far and near and organisers have staked claim for its entry into the Guinness Book of Records as the tallest bamboo structure.
The 101-foot-tall idol by the Bishnupur Sarbajanin Puja Committee has been made by Assams famed artiste and set designer Nuruddin Ahmed and his team.
It was nearly 70 per cent complete when a severe storm destroyed it on September 17. But it was reconstructed within a week by Ahmed and his team.
The workers were demoralised when the storm destroyed the idol. But we resolved to reconstruct it and ensured that it was ready two days before the pujas, Ahmed told PTI.
We have already written to the Guinness Book of Records staking our claim that the idol is the highest bamboo structure and are waiting for their response.
We are sure we will make it to the Limca Book of Records, Ahmed, who has been creating Durga idols since 1975, claimed.
The idea behind the bamboo idol is not only to create an eco-friendly structure but also to promote bamboo craft in other parts of the country and the world, he said.
Nearly 6000 bamboos were procured from lower Assams Pathshala, Chaygaon and Bijoynagar areas for the purpose and will be reused after the festival.
The artiste has also strived to give a definite Assamese character to the structure and the surroundings by using the mask-making tradition of the Vasihnavite sattras (monasteries) of Majuli island and different types of bamboo baskets used in Assamese rural households.
Another highlight of the idol is that the goddess is draped in the Assamese mekhala-chador and not the traditional saree and her jewellery is also made of bamboo.
This idol is dedicated to the people of Assam who have shown their immense love and recognised to our effort to create this work of art, Ahmed added.
The artiste is known for the numerous sets he has designed for mobile theatres, films, stage plays, tableaux and varied art forms.

ADB provides $900 mn financing for rural connectivity program in SL
The Asian Development Banks (ADB) Board of Directors has approved financing of up to $900 million for a program that will upgrade Sri Lankas road network to connect vast rural populations to jobs and services.
Improving Sri Lankas poor rural transport infrastructure is key to achieving the governments development goals, which include generating 1 million jobs, boosting income levels, and developing the rural economy, said Kanzo Nakai, an ADB Senior Transport Specialist.
ADBs Second Integrated Road Investment Program aligns with the government strategy to fully connect rural development centers with upgraded rural access roads in an area that is home to about 10 million people.
Sri Lankas economy has grown at an annual average of 6% since 2003, helping to slash poverty from 22.7% in 2002 to 6.7% in 2012-2013. Much of this progress has taken place in rural areas, where 82% of the population lives.
But Sri Lanka still faces several challenges, with poverty in some provinces and districts remaining as high as 20%. Even in comparatively better off provinces, large segments of the population live close to the poverty line and are highly vulnerable.
Progress is hindered by inadequate transport infrastructure, particularly badly maintained provincial and local roads.

Age without agony
Ageing can bring about unique health issues. The aim of this interview with Consultant Physician Dr Lasantha Ganewatta MBBS (SL), MD (Colombo), FRCP (London), MRCP (UK), DGM (Geriatrics) (UK), MRCP-SCE (Geriatrics) (UK) is to review how health issues such as frailty affect the elders.
Q: What is Frailty
A: Frailty is a common condition among elderly. It is a problematic expression of ageing. When people are ageing, they gradually lose their inbuilt reserves across multiple body systems. That is the simplest way of explaining frailty.
Q: How does frailty affect the elders
A: Frail adults are more vulnerable to diseases, hospitalisations, care-home admissions and functional dependency even under minor stress. For example, a simple chest infection could cause debilitating symptoms such as severe loss of appetite, dehydration, poor balance and mobility. Kidney impairment, heart failures and disorganised psychology will surface as a result.
Prevalence of frailty increases with age. It is 10 percent among age more than 65 years.
However, it increases up to 25 percent at the age of 85 years. It is commoner among females compared to males of the same age. Further, if a person has multiple medical, social, functional and psychological problems, he is more prone to be frail irrespective of the age.
Q: What can be done to remedy those functional disabilities
A: We engage in numerous functions from the moment of waking up until the end of the day. They include mobility, transfer, feeding, dressing, toilet use, using stairs and grooming. The ability to use telephone, shopping, housekeeping, food preparation, medication and handling finances are instrumental functions. Participating in social and family roles, recreational and occupational activities are improved functions.
Ageing restricts these functions. You can optimise the functional abilities with ageing. The elders undergo many medical concerns such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, arthritis and memory deficiency. Optimising the treatment with the best possible options is the first and foremost.
Regular exercises, especially strength and balance training, will improve the function as well as the mass of muscles and bones. However you need advice from a physician who knows your capacity and risks.
Protein-rich food, fruits and vegetables, legumes, dairy products provide calcium and vitamin D to improve the functional capacity. Identifying abilities, avoiding risk behaviour and positive thinking are also important.
If it is difficult to carry on with functions, you should inform your physician. They will examine several aspects of your health. They might refer you to a physiotherapist or an occupational therapist to assess your abilities and disabilities. You may more likely need some aids, equipment and modification of your residence to run a safe independent life.
Q: What are the main cognitive problems developed among the elders How could they be treated
A: There are mainly three cognitive problems common among the elders. The commonest is dementia. Alzheimer's disease and dementia are secondary to defective blood vessels in the brain. These are the common causes of memory impairment. Depression is another cognitive problem.
Only a few types of dementia have definitive treatment. For example, dementia secondary to deficient thyroid gland function is reversed with adequate doses of thyroxin hormone replacement.
However, optimum management of common diseases especially, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels will prevent or delay the onset of above said common types of dementia.
Quitting smoking and alcohol, less or no stress, low fat, low-salt diet, adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables improve the mental well-being. Physical exercises, at least 150 minutes per week, will refresh your physical and psychological health. It is well proven that brain-engaging activities such as reading, calculations, family and social events actively, planning own businesses, doing puzzles and Sudoku facilitate the mental well-being.
Q: How can the elders shield themselves against numerous health issues
A: The regular medical follow-up with good compliance to treatment for their long-term illnesses is number one. The connections with family, friends, neighbours, hospital, social service officer of the area and Grama Niladari are required in case of an emergency. Make your home environment safe.
There are island-wide village elderly committees headed by the elderly secretariat.
They engage in various activities. Even though you live alone, you can be an active member and can get some benefits. Besides, you will be entitled to a monthly allowance, home modifications, a senior citizen identity card and protect from abuse. The social service officer of your area could be contacted for more details.
Q: What is your advice to the healthy young people to avoid old-age frailty
A: Keep up with a healthy lifestyle. Optimise your blood sugar levels, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and any medical condition with good compliance and follow-up. Quit smoking and alcohol. Work out regularly.
The strength and balance training exercises improve your mobility and stability of walking and prevent falls.
The stress-relieving habits like listening to music, dancing, meditation, engaging in religious activities, doing yoga and sharing your leisure with the loved ones are also important for both physical and psychological health.
Most elders are reluctant to accept their limitations and risks. You should be smart to identify them and adapt your lifestyle accordingly. Your home environment should be safe. A slippery floor, dark passages, cluttered furniture, unsafe electric equipment and stairs without railings are the frequent causes of domestic accidents.

Akmeemana Dayarathna Thera, Ravindra Warnajith Perera arrested by CCD

Ven Akmeemana Dayarathna Thera and Ravindra Warnajith Perera who were summoned to the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) today morning in connection to the attack on the Rohingya safe house in Mt Lavinia last week, have been arrested.
The two suspects who surrendered to the CCD around 9am yesterday, were questioned for over five hours prior to their arrests.
The Police media unit in a statement released to the media stated that Perera was a 40-year-old resident of Gangodawila, Nugegoda and the two would be produced before the Mt Lavinia Magistrates Court, later that day.
The Police, together with the two new arrests yesterday, have arrested eight suspects in connection with the attack on the Rohingya. The six arrested earlier have been remanded until 9 October.
The 31 Rohingya refugees, mostly women and children who were evacuated from the safe house in Mt Lavinia were moved to the Boosa Detention Camp in Galle last week for greater protection.
Certain extremist groups however had declared that they would hold a protest outside the camp over the refugees being given shelter there.
The police which sprung into action after much criticism over their actions during the Mt Lavinia attack have been successful in obtaining a court order against any protest before the camp and had deployed close to 600km policemen to guard a perimeter of 2km around the camp.

[APPRECIATIONS - (02-10-2017)]
A. H. M. Azwer
A devoted friend
It was in 1967 that my husband, the late S. L. M. Shafie Marikar, became the principal of Zahira College, Colombo. He had a few friends visiting him every week in the evenings to enjoy the buns and roast bread baked at the Zahira bakery. A. H. M. Azwer was one of them.
He visited us when my husbands brother, Dr. Karahi, passed away. It was to send the obituary to a newspaper. My son was a little boy and he told me wappa has good friends. Haji Azwer was very fond of my son and brought gifts for him whenever he went abroad.
He was a very busy person, as a result of which he was very forgetful.
The most interesting episode was when Lokubandara had to attend a function at a leading hotel in Colombo. They went to all the hotels, but could not find their crowd anywhere. So they bought some hoppers and went to Haji Azwers house. There they had dinner and left the remaining hoppers on the table. In the morning, his wife inquired about the hoppers and he said, That is what Lokubandara bought for dinner. My eldest sister-in-law was very fond of listening to his election speeches during the time of President Premadasa
Haji Azwer was close to my husband at the Muslim League and The All Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference. Even after my husband passed away, Haji never failed to visit us during the month of Ramazan with a box of dates.
This year, we were not at home when he came. So he gave the dates to my neighbor who handed it over to us.
When my husband passed away in 2007, Haji Azwer wrote many articles about him. His friend is no more to write about him. This prompted me to write this article.
May he attain Jannathul Firdous.

John Blair
He was a servant of God
I was saddened with the news of the demise of John Blair, better known to us as uncle John. I was equally saddened by not being able to pay my last respects, which was prevented due to medical advice having undergone surgery at the same hospital that he spent his last days in. However, I am composing this at the scheduled time his remains were expected to be at the graveside.
Uncle John was truly a good servant of God, having helped many a Sri Lankan including my own parents, expounding the word of God clearly and wisely. He had been doing this service for 56 years in Sri Lanka, always wishing to end the journey of his life here, having left the luxuries of his parental home in New Zealand. I remember visiting this home in the mid 1970s and meeting his mother and brothers.
I have many memories of uncle John, such as to mention a few, how in the early 1970s when I visited him and his companion in their camp in Balangoda, they were after their lunch having had a few Durians which was his favourite fruit. He had installed a Windmill for the folk there, cannibalizing mainly from motor car units, for the purpose of cultivation through lift irrigation. Perhaps this was one of the first windmills to have been installed in Sri Lanka for such a purpose. Also, perhaps in order to cut on travel costs, he converted a sunbeam car to run on kerosene, which caused those around to smell his arrival and departure in addition to the noise! In the late 1980s, he laid the foundation stone at my request for the Open University Guest House in Bandarawela and after completion of the building, on my invitation, he was among the first occupants as my guest to the bungalow. He was very kind and firm on his wise counsel and was liked by both the young and old. I will always remember his constant advice to me Do your best and leave God the rest, the merciful Lord will be the final judge!
May his soul rest in peace. Dayantha Wijeyesekera
Indrani Senanayake
A woman with sterling qualities
I first came to know Indrani as a schoolmate at Visakha Vidyalaya and thereafter, have been close friends for over sixty years. Having got the top rank at the final examination of the Government Training College, Maharagama, in 1963, she was appointed to Visakha Vidyalaya as a Physics teacher during its golden era under the stewardship of S. G. Pulimood.
I too joined the staff a little later as a Chemistry teacher and we both resided in the school hostel as the youngest resident teachers. Our enthusiasm to give the best to our students knew no bounds and the results were excellent.
At all times, we were available after school for any additional work in the school office or hostel, allocated by Pulimood. It was a pleasure. Our duties at the golden jubilee celebrations of the school held at the racecourse, brought great joy. It was almost dawn by the time we were dropped back at the hostel by Pulimood herself.
Indranis brilliant students at the time, to name a few, were Professor Anula Wijesundera, the late Professor Malkanthi Balasuriya and Dr. Savithri Wijemanne, who still remember her with much gratitude and affection.
After her spell at Visakha, being the only child, she was forced to get a transfer to her hometown Horana to be with her ageing mother, where her marriage to Leslie Senanayake also took place. She continued her services at Sri Palee College Horana with great dedication. Thereafter, it is strange that we both came to reside in the same neighbourhood after her early retirement where she devoted all her time for numerous meritorious activities which were greatly supported by her husband, Leslie.
They donated their residence at Maharagama to the Dhammadeepa Foundation which is well-utilized under the guidance of Most Ven. Thalalle Chandakiththi Thera.
Indrani was involved in various religious activities organized by the Narada Centre in Colombo 7, the Dharmayathanaya as well as Mahamegharamaya at Maharagama throughout. She also travelled widely with her husband, visiting friends and relatives and also on pilgrimages overseas.
Her sudden illness one and half years prior to her passing away on July 3 was a great shock to me and many others. Even though she was handicapped during the period, the attention and tender care rendered by her husband was admirable. He left no stone unturned where treatment was concerned and her cousin Damayanthi was a pillar of support at all times.
Rev. Chandakiththi, while having his own disability, never failed to see and bless her frequently during this period of illness which I am sure would have given her great solace.
Indrani, in any emergency or illness, day or night, you were always there by me and I now miss your company very much.
May all the merit you accrued during your lifetime help you attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana in the shortest possible time!
Rukmani Raddalgoda
Timothy Wickremasinghe
An effervescent individual
Be still,
Close your eyes,
Breathe,
Listen to my footfall in your heart
I am not gone, but merely walk within you!
How many times have these words echoed in my mind during the last eleven years since that eventful day on September 16!
If life could be built on memories, then Timothys life could fill the vacuum of this vast universe and beyond and the tears that we have shed will surely fill the mighty oceans. As I reminisce the past, from the day he came to this world and the joy he filled the hearts of his parents with and everyone dear to him. With his boyish and puerile behaviour, he taught us so many lessons that we cherish today. But sadly, only memories remain!
From the timid and coy boy who walked the corridors of his alma mater, St. Josephs College, to the adolescent and the effervescent youth, Timothy, undertook every challenge thrown at him whether it be in the academic sphere or in the sports arena. However, amidst this backdrop, he was still the fun and home-loving individual that he was. Taking everything he undertook in his stride, he was able to mix the stress of his work with the pleasant joys of his extra-curricular activities like a seasoned bar tender-mixing a smooth margarita!
Nothing comes close to the pride that parents feel when they see their child growing up to be the epitome of how a loving son should be. This is when parents feel a sense of gratitude towards life and destiny for giving them a son whose upbringing has been worth all the sacrifices that they have made in their lives.
Timothy was our first-born and we still remember that little wrinkled face which has not filled out, but even then, he was the most beautiful thing we had ever seen. Certainly, both of us were so proud of him (as generally parents are and we were no exceptions!) The day he was born we vowed that we would do everything it took to give him the best in life possible. I think to a great degree we fulfilled those dreams to lavish him with our unstinting and unselfish love to meet his boyish dreams. Being the first grandson on both sides, he also had the love and care of his grandparents who showered on him equally, his desires. But amidst all these attention, he was never spoilt and always had his priorities straight, whether it be his studies, sports or his close circle of friends and relations.
But as God has it, his life was cruelly cut short amidst the very people he adored and lovedhis wife and sister, Natasha. His elaborate plans for his future with so much hope was shattered within a matter of minutes which dawned on his family an era of uncertainty with his demise.
Its indeed difficult to forget the death of a loved one, but though it is said that time is the best healer, on the contrary, time has really accentuated our loneliness at his absence.
His sweet smile, his laughing effervescence no longer bring joy to our lives, but instead has replaced it with an never-ending stream of tears, but joyful with the hope that we shall all be united one day with the creator.
As we stand by his graveside,
I can hear the echo of his voice:
Dont stand at my grave and weep;
I am not there. I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow;
I am the diamond glints on snow.
I am the sunlight on ripened grain;
I am the gentle autumns rain.
When you awaken in the mornings hush,
I am the swift uplifting rush
Of quiet birds in circled flight.
I am the soft star that shines at night.
Do not stand at my grave and cry.
I am not there, I did not die.
Your ever-loving Dadda and Mamma
Claude Wickremasinghe21/11, Rahula Mawatha,Ratmalana
Don Baldwin Kuruppu
Tribute to adear departed
No flags or fluttering drapes white
No tears flooding sympathies pouch
Let there be no fuss or bother
And noisy ostentation detestable
I know not whence I came
I know not whiter I am bound
What benefits the men derived
From the life I led I enjoyed the loving caress
The ecstasy of comforts kiss
I had my share of impediments
Despair and heartaches
I know not who I was
I know not my kith and kin
Little I knew of my wife and children
Far less my relatives and friends
I had been a stranger to most
They have been aliens to my soul
For a fleeting moment of time
We have smiled and talked for a while
Here I go I know not where
No vacuum shall remain anywhere
Dust thou art
And unto the dust thou return 
Let there be no rambling orations
Sermons moronic and dreary
Let the obsequies be brief and simple
And hasten the disposable
Upon my tombstone, if there be one,
Let epitaph be writ well and clear
Here lies a person honest and
forthright
All he had was a conscience clear.

Union Chemicals was the weeks highest price losers, declining 22.0% W-o-W to close at LKR 390.00 while Adam Investments (-20.0% Y-o-Y), Hunas Falls (-17.4% W-o-W) & Samson International(-15.1% W-o-W) were also amongst the top losers over the week.
Foreign investors closed the week in a net buying position with total net inflows amounting to LKR 0.27Bn relative to last weeks total net inflow of LKR 0.87Bn (-68.7% W-o-W).
Total foreign purchases decreased by 48.6% W-o-W to LKR 1.50Bn from last weeks value of LKR 2.91Bn, while total foreign sales amounted to LKR 1.22Bn relative to LKR 2.04Bn recorded last week (-40.06% W-o-W).
In terms of volume, Dialog & Access Engineering led foreign purchases while Singer Sri Lanka & Tokyo Cement[X] led foreign sales. In terms of value, Lion Brewery and JKH led foreign purchases while Singer Sri Lanka & Hemas Holdings led foreign sales.
Point of view
Domestic equities continued its relatively positive momentum for the 3rd consecutive week, gaining ~10 points W-o-W as the Central Bank held policy rates steady for the 4th time this year (since its policy rate hike in Mar17).
Despite a 15 point loss on the Index early in the week, the benchmark ASPI recovered ~26 points over the remainder of the week to close at 6430-levels. Greater certainty since Parliament passed the new inland revenue bill in early September has helped equity markets rebound marginally, with the Index gaining ~1.2% (~76 points) since September 7th when the bill was passed.
The monthly return on the Index has consequently been positive in September, with the Index gaining 0.74% over the month relative to the losses of 3.7% recorded in August and loss of 1.6% recorded in July.
Despite the relatively positive index performance, market activity remained largely dull over the week, with average daily turnover levels falling to Rs.0.73Bn over the week, down ~18% from last week although crossings continued to account for 24% of total market turnover yet again this week.
Average daily turnover levels for the year have been Rs. 0.91Bn, and Rs,0.86Bn when excluding the significant transaction in Singer when Hayleys acquisition of a 61.7% stake in Singer helped push up daily average turnover to Rs. 11Bn (the highest since Dec 2016).
Foreign investors meanwhile continued to remain net equity buyers over the week albeit at a lower Rs. 0.27Bn (cf. Rs. 0.87Bn last week). Markets in the week ahead are likely to remain largely flat as sentiment and activity remains broadly similar to that of this week.
External sector continues to improve in July
The Central Bank on Tuesday held rates steady for the 4th consecutive time this year, citing expectations that inflation levels will moderate over the remainder of the year while private credit growth would moderate amid the prevailing high nominal and real interest rates in domestic markets.
The CBSL was also positive on the countrys external front, adding that the increased flexibility in the determination of the exchange rate has eased pressure in the domestic FX markets and resulted in a cumulative depreciation (till Sept 22) of 2% (against the USD) cf. the 3.8% depreciation recorded in 2016. Sri Lankas external sector continued to improve in July, amid increased exports and inflows to the financial account.
Despite the trade deficit widening over the month, export earnings rose for the 5th consecutive month. Inflows to the financial account meanwhile continued to strengthen amid net inflows to the G-sec, long term loans to the government, continued portfolio investment inflows to the CSE and receipt of the 3rd tranche of the IMF EFF facility. Consequently.
The countrys Balance-of-Payments during the first seven months of 2017, recorded a surplus of $1,448.5Mn compared to a surplus of $356.0Mn recorded in the corresponding period of 2016. Sri Lankas gross official reserves as at end July 2017 meanwhile, amounted to $6.7Bn, equivalent to 3.9 months of imports, while total foreign assets amounted to $9.0Bn which is equivalent to 5.3 months of imports.

Basil drops bombshell on security forces in Jaffna
Former minister Basil Rajapaksa stunned journalists in Jaffna Sunday by admitting that security forces commanded by his president brother Mahinda committed crimes during and after the Tamil separatist war.
Basil told the Jaffna Press Club that troops continued to break the law even after the end of the war in May 2009. It is the first time that one of the kingpins of the Rajapaksa administration admitted, in the former war zone, that armed forces had committed crimes.
His remarks strengthened charges made by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka that there may have been individuals who stepped out of line and who should be investigated and punished to clear the good name of the Sri Lankan forces.
Asked for his views on Field Marshal Fonsekas remarks, including his willingness to testify before any war crimes tribunal, Rajapaksa said he was reluctant to comment, but ended up admitting to crimes by security forces.
I think our forces didnt do war crimes, but individuals might have done. It is not war crimes. We can call (it) crimes, Rajapasksa said dispensing with a Sinhala-Tamil translator and switching to English.
However, he made it clear that he was unhappy with Field Marshal Fonsekas comments. I dont think the person who led the forces at that time should talk like this.
Basil Rajapaksa and his brothers had described Fonseka as the worlds best military commander after he crushed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and declared an end to a decades-long separatist war in May 2009.
However, they quickly fell out over who should take the credit for the spectacular military success.
In Jaffna yesterday, Basil Rajapaksa also dropped another bombshell declaring that his new party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP), a breakaway faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), supports the full return of all occupied private land in Jaffna.
He said occupied land should not only be returned to Tamil owners, but those who did not originally own property should be given state land, a position that is in sharp contrast to nationalist elements supporting his brother.
The SLPP had insisted on the military maintaining its hold on private land occupied during the war.Basil said the issue of people who had disappeared during and after the war should be addressed humanely and a solution found at the earliest.
It is a question that must be addressed. We were trying to solve it (during our time), it is an emotional issue. It must be solved in a very humane way, he said without going into details.
Rajapaksa lamented that moderate Tamil parties did not cooperate with the Rajapaksa regime, but was accommodating the government of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. The SLPP was venturing into Jaffna for the first time to set up a village level organisation to kick off their party activities in the former conflict zones, he added.
Tamil politicians as well as local rights groups say tens of thousands of people disappeared during the decades-long separatist war and the next of kin have not had closure.
President Maithripala Sirisena set up the Office of Missing Persons in July clearing the way to trace about 20,000 people still missing eight years after the end of the war.

EXPECTATIONS AND TARGETS
2017. 10  Laying of the Foundation Stone 2017. 10  Commence pilingComplete Construction within a period of two years
It is estimated that there are about 3000 children born with heart diseases every year in Sri Lanka. These children deserve a chance to live. One cannot possibly comprehend the acute feeling of loss that a parent experience if one is not a parent. Only a mother or father can truly know the intense feeling of pain associated with the loss of their child. 1000  1500 children with heart diseases and critical illnesses are lost every year due to a lack of facilities for treatment in Sri Lanka. This is why our hearts need to beat for their hearts. This is where the Little Hearts Project comes in.
This is a project to construct and commission a ten storey Cardiac and Critical Care Complex at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) for Children. This Hospital LRH is the premier public childrens hospital which provides treatment to children from all districts of Sri Lanka completely free or charge. In that sense, it is a National Childrens Hospital.
Even though we commonly simplify it as a hole in the heart, what is actually means is a structural abnormality in the heart. It may be a hole in the heart, a leaking or a narrow valve, a narrow blood vessel taking blood out of the heart or a combination of these defects, said Consultant Pediatric Cardiologist at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Dr. Duminda Samarasinghe.
Compared to most of the countries in the region, we (Sri Lanka) are in a very much better position. We can treat approximately 50% of children with heart diseases in Sri Lanka totally free of charge. If you take India, it can treat only about 10-20% of its CHD burden and that is also mostly through private sector hospitals. All other SAARC countries have the same situation.
Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children (LRH) is the premier public childrens hospital which provides treatment to children from all corners of Sri Lanka, completely free of charge. It is in fact the largest Childrens Hospital in the world.
However, when it comes to heart diseases and critical illnesses, it is not in a position to provide timely and appropriate treatment to all children in need, unintentionally, and inadvertently endangering the lives of thousands of such children every year.
Out of 3000 children born every year with heart diseases it has facilities to treat only about 1500. In the Medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU), around 100 requests are made to admit critically ill children to the ICU every month, but sadly, it can accommodate only 30-40.
This clearly highlights the need for expansion in a formidable quest towards saving these children, explained Dr. Samarasinghe.
The Sri Lanka Navy is involved with the construction of the building. HE the president has ordered the Sri Lanka Navy to takeover construction upon the request made by the Little Hearts team. The Navy is fully geared to do it and is doing a great job.
Everybody at LRH appreciate their work as they have seen the difference of what the Navy is doing compared to normal contractors. The entire cost is two billion LKR.
It is also heartening to note that DSL Enterprises has announced their participation in the Little Hearts Project.
DSL Enterprises together with its own subsidiary Bluminz (Pvt) Ltd, has introduced a new pen, Speed Little Hearts as well as a new pencil named Camlin Little Hearts. The company has pledged to donate 20 percent and 13 percent of the proceeds earned from the sale of the pen and Pencil respectively to the Little Hearts project.
Since its inception, the company has focused on developing safe innovative ideas with the final aim of advancing the human life. With the recent restructuring process of the organization, the management wanted to participate in a CSR project and of the many options before us, we selected the Little Hearts project, as we felt that it was the most deserving of our attention, said Group CEO of DSL Enterprises Chamara Narangoda.

BOCs Ran Kakulu focuses on a secure  future for Sri Lankas children
Bank of Ceylon has an array of banking products and services in order to cater to the different needs of children. Ran Kekulu is a childrens savings account from Bank of Ceylon which is focused on building a secure future for the child. It offers a wide range of financial and non-financial benefits through Ran Kekulu accounts, which can be operated without any risk.
This account provides an additional 1% interest and offers the account holder hospitalization/medical insurance charges up to Rs. 100,000 that covers 10 critical illnesses.
Further an insurance cover is available for the depositor who opens the account up to a maximum of Rs 500,000. The depositor becomes eligible for an insurance cover to a maximum of Rs. 1 million if he or she maintains multiple Ran Kekulu accounts depending on the account balance.
Furthermore, 2,000 scholarships worth Rs. 15,000 each are granted annually to Ran Kekulu account holders that emerge successful at the grade 5 scholarship examination. A minimum balance of Rs. 5,000 maintained in a Ran Kekulu account qualifies the account holder for most of the privileges mentioned here.
With the stability built over the years as a state owned Bank, BOC is the safest place for your hard earned money especially for a profitable long term investment for your child. The uniqueness in this scheme is that parents can actually aim for a specifically targeted balance rather than saving randomly not knowing, what the final balance might be, stated the Deputy General Manager Sales and Channel Management Senarath Bandara.
This newest investment plan is offered to children of ages one to fifteen. There are four types of investment plans offered by the bank from Rs.500,000 and going to as much as Rs. 1 million, Rs. 2 million and up to Rs. 5 million as the return at the maturity which yields an annual interest rate of 8% per annum over the entire investment period.
The account will have to be maintained till the child reaches 18 years of age to obtain this benefit. The investment duration and the monthly installment will vary accordingly to the final amount selected and the age of the child at the starting point.
However this investment plan will accommodate children who are younger than 15 years of age in order to meet the minimum investment period required. A parent, guardian or any other individual can open the account on behalf of the child.
After opening the account all deposits can be made seamlessly by logging into the Banks online banking facility or through any of the available cash deposit machines at any time of the day or at any of the Banks 628 branches.
Customers can also simply place a standing order covering the full investment duration to ensure a timely deposit is made to the beneficiary account from the depositors account at one time.
Further information can be obtained through the Banks website, Facebook page, through twitter or from the Banks LinkedIn page and from the nearest BOC branch. In the case of no installment being made to the account either consecutively and/or intermittently the Bank will give a concession/grace period up to a maximum of six months or if it exceeds the grace period the outstanding will be transferred to a Ran Kekulu account under the name of the child.
14 Plus is another special savings account introduced for teenagers between the ages of 14-17. The account was designed to give users the first hand experience in managing the account and to draw attention away from unwanted spending sprees that are common to this age group.
A voluntary savings of pocket money is encouraged here at an early age and account holders are entitled to a BOC Debit Card to access their accounts from ATMs island wide.
As the No.1 leading bank in Sri Lanka the Bank believes that it has a greater responsibility towards the country therefore it takes a special interest in empowering children of the country to face their future challenges and invites parents to invest and build a better future.

Catalan referendum: Catalonia has 'won right to statehood'

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont says the Spanish region has won the right to statehood following a contentious referendum that was marred by violence.
He said the door had been opened to a unilateral declaration of independence.
Catalan officials later said 90% of those who voted backed independence in Sunday's vote. The turnout was 42.3%.
Spain's constitutional court had declared the poll illegal and hundreds of people were injured as police used force to try to block voting.
Officers seized ballot papers and boxes at polling stations.
"With this day of hope and suffering, the citizens of Catalonia have won the right to an independent state in the form a republic," Puigdemont said in a televised address flanked by other senior Catalan leaders.
"My government, in the next few days will send the results of today's vote to the Catalan parliament, where the sovereignty of our people lies, so that it can act in accordance with the law of the referendum."
He said theEuropean Union could no longer "continue to look the other way".
In another development, more than 40 trade unions and Catalan associations called a region-wide strike on Tuesday due to "the grave violation of rights and freedoms".
Earlier, as voting ended, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Catalans had been fooled into taking part in an illegal vote. He called it a "mockery" of democracy.
"At this hour I can tell you in the strongest terms what you already know and what we have seen throughout this day. There has not been a referendum on self-determination in Catalonia," he said.
Large crowds of independence supporters gathered in the centre of the regional capital Barcelona on Sunday evening, waving flags and singing the Catalan anthem. Anti-independence protesters have also held rallies in Barcelona and other Spanish cities.
How bad was the violence
The Catalan government said more than 800 people had been injured in clashes across the region. Those figures included people who had suffered relatively minor complaints such as anxiety attacks.
The Spanish interior ministry said 12 police officers had been hurt and three people arrested. It added that 92 polling stations had been closed.
In Girona, riot police smashed their way into a polling station where Puigdemont was due to vote, and forcibly removed those inside. Puigdemont voted at another station.
The BBC's Tom Burridge in Barcelona witnessed policebeing chased away from one polling booth after they had raided it.
TV footage showed riot police using batons to beat a group of firefighters who were protecting crowds in Girona.
The national police and Guardia Civil - a military force charged with police duties - were sent into Catalonia in large numbers to prevent the vote.
The Catalan police - the Mossos d'Esquadra - have been placed under Madrid's control, however witnesses said they showed little inclination to use force on protesters.
Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau condemned police actions against the region's "defenceless" population, but Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said police had "acted with professionalism and in a proportionate way".
How much voting took place
Catalan authorities said 319 of about 2,300 polling stations across the region had been closed by police while the Spanish government said 92 stations had been closed.
Since Friday, thousands of people have occupied schools and other buildings designated as polling stations in order to keep them open.
Many of those inside were parents and their children, who remained in the buildings after the end of lessons on Friday and bedded down in sleeping bags on gym mats.
Catalonia, a wealthy region of 7.5 million people in north-eastern Spain, has its own language and culture.
It also has a high degree of autonomy, but is not recognised as a separate nation under the Spanish constitution.
Spain's complicated relationship with the region of Catalonia is headed for the unknown.
After violence by Spanish police, a declaration of independence by Catalonia's regional government seems more likely than ever before.
Overnight Catalonia's government claimed a turnout of 2.2 million people - not far off half of the electorate. It also said that 90% voted "yes" for independence from Spain.
But given the chaotic nature of the vote, all figures should be taken with a pinch of salt. On Monday the government in Madrid will hold talks with Spanish parties to discuss a response to the biggest political crisis this country has seen in decades.

Cinderella treatment to sociology
It seems that the conceiving of the national curriculum development process for G.C.E. (A/L) has taken place and the foetus has been growing with utmost prenatal care in the ministry womb and at last the baby has been delivered with much labour pain. The writer who is very enthusiastic about the happenings of national importance happened to see the baby in the national press. Electronic media too made me aware of the status quo regarding the crucial matter that would affect far-reaching changes.
The multi-faceted result-oriented approach to the above matter by the learned veterans in the sphere of education is most welcome. Yet, the focal point of the whole endeavour seems to be lacking one aspect, in my view from the point of view of a practicing teacher at tertiary level. My primary concern here is that in the long run substantially effective solutions could be found to the problems of the ailing nation through far-sighted curriculum development catering to the nations crying needs. This aspect has been a far cry and a long-felt need in the country, yet poignantly pushed into oblivion by the educational policy planning segments.
Suicide attempt
To set the setting for my humble argument, I would like to digress your attention to the alarming rate of suicidal deaths. Many a well-dressed celebrity seems to take their lives visibly due to their undressed minds. The crux of the matter is that they knowingly or unknowingly establish a cult and their number of fans multiply by leaps and bounds.
I had a very burning sensation the other day when a very young age immature boy told me that he would commit suicide. My first attempt was to SPEND A MINUTE AND PREVENT A DEATH. It was very poignant. I felt sympathy for the whole young generation. He told me that his most favourite celebrity had died recently and he had no aim or desire to live even a minute. Then I reminded him his mother in particular and the family members in general. I was able to stop his suicide attempt.
The incident gave me food for thought. I write this article in order to make a request from the general public to heed the people in the vicinity and lend a helping hand for the nation to come out of this treacherous bog of moral paralysis. It seems to me the need of the hour.
Sociology as a subject in which the problem of suicide and related issues are extensively explored could come to our rescue in the long run. The Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary defines Sociology as follows,
The scientific study of nature and the development of society and social behaviour.
Its definition itself throws much light for us to reconsider the value of the subject in curriculum development. Its subject area explores the crucial aspect of human behaviour. Committing suicide is an expression of an abnormal social behaviour. Yet we should not forget that even Ernest Hemmingway committed suicide. I read in a paper Tagore had once tried to do the same. The list could be added with another great name. That is Silvia Plath, one of the great poetesses. In the modern context, the recent spate of deaths from committing suicide could be considered as the tip of the iceberg; an elephantine social problem of moral decay in spite of the presence of the noblest religions on land.
Young generation
An overall analysis of the situation in our country drives home the idea that the society has been weakened by numerous social factors. This subject also brings social organisations, marriages, social problems, social thoughts, social thinkers and almost all the spheres of living under investigation. The learners could study social systems and it offers the students many an avenue to do surveys and research.
To conclude, the biographies of the great social thinkers could do away with the low taste of the young generation corrupted by extensive exposure to the social media. Almost all the universities produce quite a large number of graduates on this much-needed discipline every year.
I met an energetic and very resourceful young graduate the other day who is an enthusiastic teacher just fresh from the university, on askance he told me that he taught Buddhism in Grade Nine in that school. He further told me that some schools had a lot of graduates who had specialized the subject, sociology.
The principles of sociology could be inculcated in the tender mind very effectively by efficient teachers. This could be geared very easily without much effort. The late professor Dr. Nandasena Rathnapala tried his level best to introduce this subject to the national curriculum, but it was in vain. His researches were ridiculed by some pundits of the land those days, but their validity is felt in the country now.
In our country, most of the time students are taken as guinea pigs for seemingly unimportant experiments may be for the World Bank projects or to appease the hunger of the maverick educationists. Yet, the introduction of sociology could be given a trial.
There is no time like the present!

Rohingya responsibility
This refers to your editorial titled as Find solution to Rohingaya refugees problem published on September 28.
I agree with your conclusions that the government should take swift measures. In fact, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka are the countries seriously involved in the restoration and resettlement of Rohingya refugees. It is the issue which not only had a human rights angle, but seriously of security concern to India as well. In my opinion all the stakeholder nations should jointly discuss the issue and work out the solution which can provide succour and relief to genuine refugees and help in identifying the persons who are posing security threats in connivance with terror groups.
The major responsibility lies on Myanmar government to recall and ensure rehabilitation of Rohingya refugees. The UNHCR and other Human Right conventions should be followed in resolving this grave crisis.

City stay ahead of United with win over champions Chelsea
LONDON, Saturday - Manchester City stayed ahead of age-old local rivals Manchester United at the top of the Premier League on Saturday with a deserved 1-0 win away to champions Chelsea. After Jose Mourinhos United romped to a 4-0 victory over bottom club Crystal Palace, City had much the better of the late game at Stamford Bridge.
We are so happy, City manager Pep Guardiola said. The way we played, especially in the second half, was pleasing.
A second-half goal by former Chelsea forward Kevin de Bruyne won it and left City just ahead of United on goal difference.
Chelsea, starting the day three points behind the Manchester pair in third place, dropped to fourth after two more goals from Harry Kane helped Tottenham Hotspur to a comfortable 4-0 win away to Huddersfield Town.
Manager Antonio Conte blamed Champions League exertions from midweek for his teams subdued performance. It is logical when you play three games in seven (sic) days you risk something, he said.
Uniteds win left Palace rooted to the bottom of the table after a record seventh successive defeat without a goal to start the season.
Beaten 5-0 away by City in their last game, Palace avoided a repetition but became only the second team since the Premier League began to lose their first seven games. Unlike Portsmouth in 2009-10, though, they have not scored a single goal.
Romelu Lukakus late strike meant that free-scoring United have hit four goals in a game six times this season.
Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini scored before halftime and when Fellaini headed in his second just after the interval, the points were made even more secure.
We started strong and we finished strong, said Mourinho. England striker Kane continued his astonishing run by following up a Champions League hat-trick in midweek with two more goals as Spurs went 3-0 up by halftime at promoted Huddersfield. Ben Davies scored the other first-half goal and Moussa Sissoko added a fourth just before the final whistle.
Kane, having failed to score at all in August once again, made it 13 for club and country during September.
Goals to games it is probably the best month I have had, especially after August, he said.
Watford recovered from two goals down at West Bromwich Albion to go fifth after the home team scored twice in three minutes in the first half through Salomon Rondon and Jonny Evans. Abdoulaye Doucoure kept Watford in contention and Brazilian Richarlison headed an equaliser in the final minute of added time. Substitute Peter Crouch earned Stoke City a 2-1 win at home to Southampton after Maya Yoshida had equalised Mame Biram Dioufs opener. Earlier Saido Berahino, who has not scored for 30 games, missed a penalty conceded by Southamptons Virgil van Dijk, playing his first game of the season. In two key games at the wrong end of the table, West Ham United had a late 1-0 win over Swansea City to move above them but Bournemouth were held at home by Leicester City. West Ham relieved some of the pressure on manager Slaven Bilic when two of his substitutes combined for a dramatic winning goal.
Arthur Masuaku crossed for Diafra Sakho to score, taking the London side out of the bottom three and putting Swansea there instead.
It was a difficult atmosphere in some ways, West Ham goalkeeper Joe Hart said of a home crowd who grew increasingly restless.

The Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) lashed out at the government and said that although the government says it wants to promote exporters, it is not supporting this effort.
One of the biggest issues is inconsistency of regulations and we need a clear policy statement from the government which would stay in place for a longer period of time, the CNCI said.
Each time a budget is read out, we see changes and this should not be the ideal way to promote exporters.
Ranjith Hettiarachchi
Former President CNCI Gamini Gunasekera said that today the government is looking at signing several FTAs with countries like Singapore, Bangladesh and China and is also looking at an enhanced cooperation agreement (ETCA) with India in addition to the present FTA.
He said that before implementing these, the anti-dumping law must come into place or the local industries may be at a huge risk.
Local industries cannot compete with cheap and inferior dumped goods and this law must be put into place. Successive ministers in charge of industries for the past eight years have promised to bring this in Parliament, but it is still to happen.
Successive governments have made a concerted effort to promote Sri Lankan exports. In their endeavor to promote exports, a concessionary tax rate was granted to profits attributable to export-related turnover, said President of CNCI, Tissa Seneviratne.
As you are aware, a small price differential can result in securing an export order or losing it altogether to a competitor from another country. The concessionary income tax rate offered to exporters was an incentive for companies to enter the export market. Under the new Inland Revenue Act, only a business with exports of at least 80% of their turnover will qualify for a concessionary tax rate. This really discourages SME exporters.
An existing business cannot enter an export market to export 80% of their production initially. Most exporters entered the export market with small orders and gradually increase export volumes. It is therefore important to incentivize every individual export if the intention of the government is to encourage newcomers to enter the export market. This was achieved hitherto by granting a concessionary tax rate to the profit attributable to export turnover, irrespective of its value to total turnover.
Our Chamber represents many indirect exporters who have immensely benefited from such tax concessions. They were able to price their products to exporters lower than what they would offer to the local market considering the benefit of taxation.
Only established exporters stand to gain from tax concessions offered to companies achieving a 80% export target. Some of the large exporters today too would have had a low percentage of their turnover as exports in their initial years of operations. Would they have pursued an export strategy if tax incentives were not available even with a lower percentage of export turnover
What would be the overall impact when a concession enjoyed by many businesses up to now are withdrawn overnight We appeal to you to maintain the concessionary tax rates granted to exporters and indirect exporters irrespective of the volume of their exports.
The government launched a national programme this year to nurture 2,000 new entrepreneurs to become exporters. The proposed increase of taxation will adversely impact entrepreneurs coming under this programme which certainly is not the intention of the government. These entrepreneurs would have prepared their business plans considering the concessionary tax rate applicable to exporters.
Former President CNCI Ranjith Hettiarachchi said that they were surprised to note the tax imposed on R&D, an area lacking in the Sri Lankan sector. Research and Development is the key to the success of any country and Korea and Japan are the living examples for it. However back in Sri Lanka, for reasons best known to the government, a tax is imposed on R&D and this is absurd.
We also strongly condemn the plan to tax senior citizens of their savings deposits. This segment should be left free of any taxes.
He also said that the government must re-look the corporate tax policy again.
Special Representative, for SME, CNCI, K.C. Vignarajah said that it is true that the government needs revenue. Why not look within the government and try to reduce some Ministers, turn around some of the ailing SOEs like SriLankan and try to save money.
It was a popular slogan during the elections that high personalities in the previous government robbed and their money was deposited overseas. So get them and stop taxing the key areas of growth which would have long term negative impacts on the economy.

Combating mob violence
There are a number of reasons that can turn otherwise non-violent individuals into a fierce mob. Lack of faith in local law enforcement agencies, distrust in judicial system, lack of education and potentially violent mindset further reinforce the urge to take law in hands. Mob justice is by all means a violation of basic human rights. It is an evidence of failure of law enforcement agencies in curbing crime, maintaining peace in society and ensuring the safety of its citizens, even if they are suspected of involvement in a crime
Mob justice is when a group of people take law in their hands and punish an alleged criminal themselves rather than getting the authorities involved and following proper prosecution. Incidents of mob violence are a clear reflection of a society that has lost all morals to be humane. Practices of mob justice are common in many parts of the world and yet in 21st Century, mob violence results in assault of suspected criminals and most of the times death at the hand of a group of people comprising of co-operators and spectators.
These days people would incite the onslaught, make videos on their mobile phones and howl in excitement. It has also been, sadly, observed that many of the incidents take place amid the presence of security personnel who act as onlookers, forgetting their moral and constitutional duty.

Combating the scourge of religious persecution: Changing hearts and minds in the Middle East
The overriding lesson is that violent religious extremism had hurt everyone there. This shared experience promoted the message that religious persecution was an affront not to one faith or another, but to all people as they sought their own understanding of and response to the transcendent, including sects little known in the West, such as Bahaism and Zoroastrianism.
Christians and other religious minorities obviously need to learn how to better organise and defend their right to practice their faith. But they also need allies among religious majorities to turn religious freedom into a legal principle and political practice. Such a transformation also is necessary to reduce the social discrimination and violence which characterizes many Muslim societies, in particular. While individual transformation seems slow compared to the sort of political solutions most people advocate, it is the best and only firm foundation upon which to build other changes.
In many countries around the world believing differently than the majority about God carries a high cost. We all have a stake in promoting a more humane and tolerant vision internationally. Thankfully today there are people doing so, and doing so successfully, in the centre of violent regions.

Racial intimidation
This is a post made by a Sinhala Buddhist who was caught up unintentionally when a group threatened 31 Rohingya Refugees comprising 7 men, 7 ladies and 17 little children in Mount Lavinia.
Before people start justifying or criticizing let them first question as a Buddhist country should we have intimidated those poor refugees regardless of if we agree if they should be here or not. There were 7 men 7 women and 16 children some infants  these were not armed terrorists but frightened people surrounded by a mob asking for their blood  we must ask ourselves is this the Buddhist way  next where in Buddhism does it promote or condone violence this behavior is unacceptable. If the Buddha was here his eyes would be filled with divine tears and his heart would break to see those in robes and those professing to speak in the name of Buddhism promote violence and hatred. This was a very sad and disturbing day for me personally when will we learn and where is what we Sinhalese say about 83 etc. Never again to me it seems disturbingly worse if it can be so. When you are threatened or when you are faced with violence then you might realize the urgency of the need for positive action in this beautiful island home.
BILL ON MOB VIOLENCE
All India Majlis-e-IttehadulMuslimeen (AIMIM) chief and Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi sent notice of a private members Bill to combat incidents of mob lynchings.
Provisions of the Bill
The Bill enjoin penalties of a minimum of ten years imprisonment on public servants for acts of omission.
The Bill criminalizes the act of mob violence as well as acts of omission by public servants.
Provisions such as the establishment of Special Courts for the trial of mob violence, with judges for the same being appointed by a collegium of the five senior-most judges of the High Court are in the Bill.
The Special Courts shall also have the additional responsibility of receiving complaints of mob violence, and has the responsibility of setting up Special Investigation Teams (SIT) and appointing a public prosecutor. The SIT and public prosecutor, besides reporting to the Special Court, shall also be under the supervision of the Supreme Court (via the appointment of an amicus curiae).
Punishment of up to life imprisonment for those found guilty of engaging in mob violence, and special compensation and witness protection are also included in the Bill.
The most significant portion of the Bill is, however, the awarding of penalties on public servants for failing to investigate properly due to malafide intentions or wilful neglect of their duties.
Mob violence has been defined to include any act where two or more persons injure, harm, oppress, and threaten any persons enjoyment of a right guaranteed under the Constitution of India or on the basis of their identity.

Punishing lawbreakers
First and foremost, the local policing system and judicial systems need to be improved. That not only involves punishment against those who commit a crime but also those who resort to mob violence falsely supposing it to be the only way of justice and assuming it to be their responsibility to do so. Only then we can expect a shift in the trends prevalent in our society. Secondly, it is very important to educate people with basic human rights. It is a way of empowering the individuals and making them realise that if today they violate someone elses rights, tomorrow their rights might be violated too. There has never been such an urgency of teaching our children the lessons of non-violence. Violence is no remedy. The least we can be trained is to not become a part of such violence. Creating a social sense of refraining from violence would ultimately lead to a peaceful, tolerant society we all strive for.

Constitutional Assembly proposes increase in civil society representatives
The Interim Report on Constitutional Reforms submitted to the Constitutional Assembly (CA) by the Steering Committee last month has proposed to change the composition of Constitutional Council to increase civil society representatives.
The ten-member Constitutional Council (CC), is an apex decision making body that makes recommendations with regard to the appointment of high ranking public and judicial officials such as the IGP, Attorney General, Auditor General, Secretary General of Parliament, Chief Justice and Judges of superior courts and members and chairmen of the independent commissions.
The Interim Report has suggested the CC should be constituted of three ex-officio MPs and seven non-MPs. The CC is now comprised of seven Members of Parliament and three civil society representatives.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya (Chairman), Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan are ex-officio members in it while Dr. A.T. Aryaratne, Dr. Radhika Coomaraswamy and Shibly Aziz are serving as civil society representatives.
Minister John Seneviratne, JVP MP Vijitha Herath (minor party representative), Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka (Presidents representative) and former Minister Dr. Wijayedasa Rajapakshe (PMs representative) are the other members in it.
When the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was presented to Parliament in April 2015, the Governments original proposal was to make the CC a non-political body, but it had to accommodate an eleventh hour Amendment to include more political representatives giving way to the pressure of the UPFA members in the Opposition in order to win the two thirds.
However, concerns were raised on the independence of the CC when its majority is constituted by political members.
Deviating from their previous position, the SLFP and Joint Opposition in their separate observations given in the report have accepted the need to change the composition of the CC in order to make it a non-political independent decision making body.

Construction sector biggest ETF, EPF defaulter
The construction sector is the biggest defaulter in providing ETF and EPF facilities to the workers, says Nissanka Wijeratne, Secretary General, CEO of Chamber or Construction Industry(CCI).
To address this issue, every worker in the construction sector including sub contractors should be issued a smart card with a unique identification number for accessing social schemes and benefits, Wijeratne said.
He made these observations at a seminar on Construction Industry and the Way Forward, organized by World University Service of Canada in collaboration with the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka.
To address the acute labour shortage in the industry, the government should come up with a massive publicity campaign to attract young school-leavers and others within the working age group to join the construction sector. In the meantime, the government has approved recruitment of 2,500 workers from Nepal and Myanmar and the first batch will arrive in mid- October.
According to Wijeratne, the apparel industry too will have to import workers as the industry is projecting a 15,000 requirement of foreign workers.
Earlier it was reported that the anticipated expenditure on construction projects announced by the government and private sector is Rs 6,500 billion during 2016 to 2020, and the estimated work force is one million.

Does exercise make you eat more
After an hour in the gym youre feeling pretty good about yourself. Less so two hours later, when youve demolished half the fridge. But the relationship between exercise and weight loss is complicated: not all exercise stimulates appetite to the same extent. And individuals vary in how much weight they lose from exercise.
The solution
This latest research, a small study of 16 healthy young men, measured the effects of different types of exercise on levels of acylated ghrelin, a hormone in the blood that is thought to increase appetite. The researchers provided standardised meals after the exercise and asked the men to rate their hunger levels. The study showed that the more intense and long the exercise, the more the levels of acylated ghrelin were suppressed. Those who ran for 90 minutes still had lower levels an hour after exercise. They also felt less hungry for longer. Shorter, more intense workouts reduced hormone levels more than easy jogging but the men still felt peckish a bit earlier than those who ran for longer.
Prof David Stensel of the School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences at Loughborough University, one of the authors of the study, says that their previous work does not show that people overcompensate in how much they eat after exercise. Its a difficult area to research as, unless you directly watch what people do, you have to rely on them self-reporting the length and intensity of their exercise and how much they ate  not always accurately.
But if you want to lose weight, you should exercise as well as diet. To be effective you need to exercise at a level above 75% of your maximum heart rate, according to David Broom, the lead author of the study and professor at the Academy of Sport and Physical Activity at Sheffield Hallam University. -theguardian.com

Enslavement and abuse of children, right under our nose
At a time when the rest of the world and children in Sri Lanka were merrymaking and celebrating Childrens Day, poor little Sandun (Pictured here on Left) was just glad to have been found and rescued.
The Galaha Police had been tipped-off of a boy who was abused by his brothers in Madakakila, Deltota.
The police eventually traced the house on hearing the screams and cries of Sandun. Sandun who was constantly abused by his two brothers and a sister-in-law was found with logs tied to his feet, broken bones and infected injuries.
It was revealed that his father had passed away and since his mother was overseas, he was under the care of his two brothers. One of his brothers is a 24-year-old father of two. Sandun had studied up to Grade 3 after which he had come to live with his brothers, which is when the abuse began.
Sandun had multiple fractures in both his arms and legs. His brothers who physically abused him had tied logs to his feet, so he wouldnt move. His injuries had been infected but he was never given any medication.
Such is the situation of some children in Sri Lanka who are far from sight and mind. Lets strive to make Sri Lanka a safer place for children, not just on Childrens Day but every day.

## Title: ERROR OF JUDGEMENT

ERROR OF JUDGEMENT
It is the duty of the government to maintain law and order and in a plural society like ours to prevent unlawful actions specially targeted against minority communities. This is particularly important to maintain the integrity of our plural State so that all the people can support it. But if a section of society feels that the government is not protecting them they will seek their own ways of protection in society. It is the duty of the government to maintain law and order and take action against all transgressors the law.
The government seems to be afraid of the Buddhist monks who are resorting to violent speech and action against the Muslims. But remember what happened to SWRD who allowed some monks to take the law into their own hands.
Crime against humanity
These Buddhist monks were perhaps men in yellow robes who are using the yellow robe as a cover to get immunity from the law enforcement authorities. It is very necessary to act against anybody and everybody who violates the law whether he is in yellow robes or not. If the government doesn't take timely and proper action to implement the existing law against incitement to disaffection they are paving the way for chaos. Prior to 1963 the administrative machinery and the Police enforced the law against incitement.
But SWRD and the SLFP interfered in the normal administration of the law and SWRD permitted hate speech to create disaffection among communities under the cover of allowing freedom of speech. He paid the price himself for unleashing unrighteous forces and undermining the rule of law scrupulously enforced previously by the Administration and the Police as inherited from the colonial power. This was a travesty of liberal democracy which is founded on the Rights of Man which cannot be abolished by majority rule.
These Rights are inherent to all human beings and hence the Muslims have these rights like the rest of us.
To violate their rights is a crime against humanity and the government cannot permit it by default of taking punitive action, in order to avoid incurring the displeasure of the majority Sinhala Buddhists who though passive and silent do not approve of such conduct by these monks.
They do not, however, voice their criticism against the monks whom they have been taught to respect in a feudal society.
The Prime Minister should act in terms of moral rights and respect the fundamental rights of all the people including the minorities. He is the Prime Minister of all and not only of the majority. In any case, he is a moral being and is bound by the moral law and such law overrides majority rule.
Majority support
His background and education are such that he cannot behave like an illiterate communalist. Remember the proclamation of the Rights of Man which came to be incorporated in the United Nations charter.
One hopes and prays that the Prime Minister and the government will act righteously as they are morally bound and such moral imperatives override the majority will.
The majority will is not always right and a ruler is required to follow what is right and morally justifiable and not merely the majority will where the majority will is opposed to what is morally right he cannot opt for what is morally wrong merely to retain his majority support. One hopes the Prime Minister and the government will have the moral courage to act righteously where such righteous conduct clashes with the majority will. In such circumstances, the leaders should guide the people instead of succumbing to their moral errors. One hopes we have upright and righteous leaders in the UNP unlike the populist SLFP of MR.

Executive Presidency will be abolished as promised - MP
UNP MP Dr. Ashubodhi Marasinghe yesterday said the proposed constitutional reforms come in as a part of the positive social transformation promised by the government in 2015.
He pointed out, for the first time in history, all political parties have come to an agreement for an undivided country.
We should not let this golden opportunity slip away. Three Presidents including Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Mahinda Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirisena promised to abolish the Executive Presidency in five Presidential Elections. However, both Bandaranaike and Rajapaksa failed to do it." he said.
At the last Presidential Election, Rajapaksa did not promise to abolish the executive presidency, as he wanted to become the President for the third time.It was evident that people did not vote for him. They voted for Sirisena who promised to abolish the executive presidency. Dr. Marasinghe said. Dr. Marasinghe said it is unbecoming if, for the fifth time, a President failed to keep the promise of abolishing the executive presidency. He also commended the memory of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha thera, who called for constitutional reforms. Dr. Marasinghe also alleged that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is misleading the Maha Sangha with regards to the proposed constitutional reforms.
Meanwhile, MP Dr. Jayampathi Wickremeratne, a member of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms, said he is of the opinion that the National Audit Bill must soon be presented to Parliament.
He also said the report of the Finance subcommittee of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms, was the only report which was unanimously agreed, which emphasises the importance of the National Audit Bill.
These observations were made at a press brief held yesterday at the Government Information Department on the interim report submitted to the Constitutional Assembly by the Steering Committee of the constitutional reforms.

FAO, EU aid for agricultural development in Vavuniya
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in partnership with the European Union (EU), has completed renovation of the Agriculture Adaptive Research Center and the Government Seed Production Farm located in Thandikulam in the Vavuniya district. The improvement of the two institutions will contribute immensely towards agricultural development and modernization in the Vavuniya district directly benefiting farmer families.
The improved Government Seed Production Farm was opened by Head of Cooperation of the European Union Delegation to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Libuse Soukupova, in the presence of Agriculture and Agrarian Services Provincial Minister K. Sivanesan, while the Adaptive Research Center was declared open in the presence of Agriculture Ministry Additional Secretary (Development) Dr. W. M. W. Weerakoon and officials of the Department of Agriculture. Vavuniya Additional Government Agent T. Thireskumar and FAO Programme Manager (EU-SDDP) Rohini Singarayer were also present at the ceremonies.
A fully-equipped laboratory and office premises were established at the Adaptive Research Center with financial assistance from the EU through the European Union Support to District Development Programme (EU-SDDP). The improvement of the Adaptive Research Center will enable effective research on the adaptation of crop varieties [mainly, 'other field crops' (OFC)] to the local soil and climatic conditions and pest and disease management. The research conducted at the center is ultimately shared with the agricultural extension officers and farmers through field days and demonstrations while a key component is publishing the research. The subsequent production of seeds of these crop varieties at the Government Seed Production Farms contribute towards an integrated service to the farmer communities in the district.
The Government Seed Production Farm (GSPF) in Vavuniya, an institution which comes under the purview of the Northern Provincial Department of Agriculture, was also improved with funding from the EU. The GSPF produces seeds (seed paddy, vegetables and OFC) and planting materials (seedlings, grafted and budded plants). It also serves as a seed-processing unit where farmers can bring their seeds for cleaning. The construction of the office building and a sales outlet, a farm machinery shed, an agro-well, pump house and a surface tank for water storage and the renovation of the seed-processing unit have been completed by FAO under the EU-SDDP. A seed-processing machine, combine harvester and a transplanter were also provided to increase the production capacity of the GSPF which in turn leads to the availability of more seeds and planting material for nearly 5,000 farmer families annually in Vavuniya.
Success in agricultural and rural development in Sri Lanka depends on individual actions of thousands of rural farmers whose decisions are shaped by the information, knowledge and technologies available to them, said Libuse Soukopova, That is why the EU values the partnership with FAO to facilitate the improvement of productive agriculture infrastructure facilities that will benefit rural farmer communities to restart and rebuild their lives in a time of peace.
The first Fisheries Information Center established in the Mannar district was handed over by Soukupova to Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Additional Director B. S. Miranda.
The fully-furbished Fisheries Information Center which consists of an administration division, a training hall and a library containing resource books, publications and maps will benefit 2,700 persons annually, including fisheries extension officers, fishers, university lecturers and students, planners and researchers.
Speaking at the handing over ceremony, FAO Policy Officer/ FAO Representative to Sri Lanka and the Maldives acting-in-charge Itziar Gonzalez said, The FAO, together with the EU, is ensuring that State institutions and productive infrastructure facilities are accessible and strengthened in order to enhance sustainable and profitable livelihoods. We are pleased to note that this Fisheries Information Center will make a difference in the lives of fishers, particularly small-scale fishers with limited access to the latest technological and management developments required for their livelihoods.
Within the framework of the EU-SDDP, FAO is increasing income generation among vulnerable population by supporting agriculture, livestock and fisheries related economic activities targeting 21,000 households in Mannar, Vavuniya, Puttalam, Anuradhapura, Batticaloa, Ampara and Monaragala districts.

Former EPC members seek police protection
A proposal seeking police protection to all members of the Eastern Provincial Council including provincial ministers until a fresh election is held to the council was forwarded to the President, Prime Minister and the the subject ministers, Former Council Chairman Chandradasa Galappaththi said.
The Council stood dissolved at present.
He said he made the proposal as members had pointed out that the council covered an area where an ethnic conflict had just ended and peace was slowly returning. He said, therefore, they needed personal security further.
He said he had informed all former members to return computers, tabs and other equipment given for them for official work.

Full capacity brain not guranteed until 14
We really can't expect children to recall many details until they are in their early teens when the hippocampus is actually fully formed, a new study finds.
Previously, scientists thought that the hippocampus, a part of the brain responsible for memory and emotion, was fully developed by around age six.
The researchers gave adults and children between ages six and 14 a task to assess how well they remembered details, and found that that ability improved in line with the growth of two particular sub-regions of the hippocampus.
Scientists from the Max Planck Institutes in Berlin, Germany and the University of Stirling in Scotland found that significant changes occurred in the areas of the hippocampus responsible for recalling detail well after the age of six.
Six-year-old children are in a stage of rapid development.
At that age, their vocabularies grow by about ten words a day, their abilities to recognize patterns are improving, and their minds straddle the real and imagined worlds, which they describe in great detail.
But until they are about 14, this study reveals, children's ability to recall fine distinctions between two similar objects is still developing.
Researchers in Berlin, Germany showed images to children between ages six and 14, as well as adults, then showed them similar images with details slightly altered and asked them to recall general or specific characteristics.
They compared the subjects' performances to magnetic resonance images (MRI) that had been taken of their brains taken while they were lying still.
The scans showed that two important sub-regions of the hippocampus - the dentate gyrus and the entorhinal cortex - were larger in older subjects, who also performed the memory task better.
The dentate gyrus is important to remembering distinctions, and the entorhinal corex connects the hippocampus to the part of the brain responsible for sensory perception and spatial reasoning.
This new finding shows that both of these areas are still growing after age six, but the pace of that growth varied from subject to subject.
The trajectory of this growth 'is important, as it directly influences the fine balance between pattern separation and pattern completion operations and, thus, developmental changes in learning and memory,' says study co-leader Markus Werkle-Bergner of the Max Planck Institutes.
The hippocampus is responsible for emotion and episodic memory. The hippocampus takes in new information and commits it to longer-term memory, making it essential in learning.
Dr Nora Newcombe, a professor of psychology at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, says that children as young as four have no trouble making cognitive distinctions between separate objects, but struggle to recall them.
Dr Newcombe visited the Max Planck lab, and said, for example, that children of all ages were able distinguish between two pictures of ducks with subtle differences. But they wouldn't be able to recall which was which on command.
'These are very fine distinctions. You wouldnt make [these children] into bird spotting experts,' she says, but this doesn't suggest that a six-year-old child will struggle with the sorts of things they'd be learning and recalling in school.
The research done by lead author Dr Attila Keresztes of the Max Planck Institutes and his team 'related memory behavior to growth or size in various sub-regions, dividing it much more finely than people have been able to do before, so thats fascinating,' says Dr Newcombe.
She says that while the new discovery won't change the way we teach children of varying ages, it gives us important insights into how and when these regions of the brain are changing and developing.
Children's brains are difficult to analyze closely for several reasons. Tasks meant to demonstrate things like their memory capabilities have to be 'difficult, but not too difficult,' says Dr Newcombe. -dailymail.co.uk

Gateway to Southern Expressway,  Seven  Eleven Hotel Kesbewa opens
Seven Eleven, Hotel Kesbewa
The newly opened Seven to Eleven Hotel in Kasbewa, situated in a tranquil, picturesque location just 15 minutes to the Kahathuduwa exit , is an ideal retreat for Southern Expressway passengers, tourists and for corporate, MICE events, and family functions.
The second venture of Asia Holdings Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, Seven Eleven Kesbewa will be an asset for tourist travelling especially between the Southern and Central Provinces using the Southern Expressway. The uniqueness of the hotel is its ability to facilitate guests coming from Down South heading to the airport by providing star class cuisine and accommodation. The guest gets the opportunity either to refresh and exit to the airport or stay a night after an exhausting journey in the South at Seven Eleven, Hotel Kesbewa. This nulls the need for them to travel all the way to Colombo which is the normal practice and get tangled in the huge traffic.
Similarly, tourists coming from Central Province locations such as Kandy, Pinnawala or Nuwara Eliya going down South now need not go to Colombo for refreshments and get caught in the Colombo traffic, instead they could enter the Southern Expressway by taking the Kadawatha outer circular expressway entrance and depart from the Kahathuduwa exit for a star class meal and refreshments or an overnight stay at the brand new classy Seven Eleven Hotel and Restaurant Kesbewa.
Tourists after enjoying a morning session elephant demonstration which in Pinnawala concludes at 11 am could reach Seven Eleven, Hotel Kesbewa around 1 pm for lunch and then proceed to their Southern destination which will provide much convenience to them. Moreover for Southern Expressway travelers there is no star class facility in Kottawa or Kahathudawa to refresh themselves. Seven Eleven, Hotel Kesbewa fills this vacuum and is already getting popular as a strategic stopover point for travelers from Nuwara Eliya to down South locations and vice versa, travelers from down South to the Airport, Negombo or any other destination in Sri Lanka.
The Seven Eleven Hotel chain has two more ventures a hotel and restaurant in Thalawathugoda and they also plan to setup their flagship hotel in Hikkaduwa with an investment of not less than Rs 150 million next year said its General Manager Mahesh Kariyawasam . This is to be on par with the governments goal of attracting four million tourists by 2020, he said.
Seven Eleven, Hotel Kesbewa, consist of 14 deluxe luxury rooms, star class restaurant, pool, rooftop VIP lounge and continental food. Kariyawasam said the specialty of their menu is that it is a mixture of eastern, continental, western and all Asian cuisine.
The hotel is also member of ASMET Sri Lanka. He said that they target tourists foreign and local from all travel agents, direct contacts and booking machines such as booking.com, Agoda.com and Expedia.
Already there has been a very good response from travel agents and guests response has been very good for their personalized service, he said.

Hard stuff
Many of todays most visible feminist authors, including Filipovic and her contemporaries Jessica Valenti (Sex Object: A memoir, 2016) and Lindy West (Shrill: Notes from a loud woman, 2016), shaped their style by contributing to funny, gossipy group blogs where articles about Photoshopped actors ran next to posts detailing the latest political attack on birth control.
For every competent feminist book, Camille Paglia wrote in the Observer in 1995, there are twenty others shot through with inaccuracies, distortions, and propaganda. It is an inflammatory claim  notoriously, provocation is Paglias primary if not exclusive mode  but without the feminist modifier, it is a plain fact. It is difficult for any nonfiction book to be competent, let alone good, whether the topic is women or history or science; writing well is a challenge, as is, relatedly, the exercise of logic. In the present political climate, the creation and dissemination of progressive work can feel doubly urgent, and judging by a spate of disappointing publications (Paglias collected essays among them), todays mainstream feminism is not nearly as rigorous, comprehensive or useful as the moment demands.
First, a sketch, to illustrate the stakes: the United States incarcerates over 200,000 women, as many as two-thirds of whom have minors at home. When factoring in women on parole or probation, the number currently supervised by the criminal justice system balloons to more than a million. More than a third of American single mothers live in poverty, and according to the National Womens Law Center, more than one in eight women are poor. In recent years, much has been made of womens record-high college attendance, with less comment on the fact that women hold nearly 65 per cent of the nations student debt ($1.3 trillion at the latest tally).
Procedure inaccessible
The US has more maternal deaths than anywhere else in the developed world, and black women are almost four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than are white women. Ninety per cent of US counties lack a clinic that provides abortion, which renders the procedure inaccessible to about 40 per cent of women who can get pregnant, and it would be a mistake to assume expense is not as daunting an obstacle as location.
Meanwhile, gender violence was brought back into the headlines this summer, albeit briefly, by a report, carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), analysing murders of American women. Strangers are responsible for only 16 per cent of female homicides, which means that a womans killer is usually her current or former romantic partner, or else another friend or family member. In response, the CDC recommended bystander intervention training and suggested that states limit access to guns.
These measures feel inadequate (and, especially in the case of guns, impracticable). How do we keep men from killing women Or, how do we simply keep men from killing The question is one that mainstream feminism doesnt ask much any more, aside from periodic invocations of toxic masculinity.
Labour conditions
This litany of entrenched, intentional injustices predates Donald Trumps presidency, so professional feminists who have neglected these matters cannot excuse themselves with the claim that times abruptly changed.
The fixations that have dominated middle-class feminism in recent years  assaults on campus, underwhelming (hetero) sexual encounters, the pathetic ratio of female to male CEOs, sexism in Silicon Valley  cannot speak meaningfully to many of the horrors less advantaged women face both at home and abroad: dangerous labour conditions, deportation, murder by police, imprisonment.
This is not to say middle-class concerns are categorically frivolous but rather that their elevation comes at the expense of a more cogent and inclusive ideology.
We have narrowed the scope of public feminism to a pinprick, rehashing yet another Lena Dunham controversy when we should have been developing and promoting reforms that encompassed systems of exploitation not defined by gender alone  the rapid progression of mass incarceration, venal health-care systems and repeated, successful attacks on voter rights, to name some of the most glaring. This failure could perhaps have gone on unabated for the immediate future but now, without the superficial reassurance of a woman in the White House, mainstream feminism has to face up to its own deficiencies. One might begin with those evidenced by blogging pundits turned highprofile authors.
Jill Filipovic is one such established tastemaker who in her uninspired The H-Spot: The feminist pursuit of happiness mixes several trendy elements (women, happiness and pop psychology) to deliver a nearly substance- free result.
We have a problem with female pleasure and that is holding women back, she writes in her introduction. Our political and cultural priorities arent about making life more enjoyable, but about getting ahead, attaining bigger and better things, having it all. Its a disingenuous, banal and unconvincing diagnosis of the female condition. Women are not oppressed by nebulous pressures to get ahead any more than anyone else in the West; indeed, in the first chapter, Filipovic acknowledges that one of the paradoxes of happiness, researchers have found, is that women tend to be happier than men.
Male enjoyment
Which is to say, if theres a problem with female pleasure, we must be in the midst of an outright crisis for male enjoyment. But she persists with this flimsy frame because it allows her to expound on comfortable subjects such as why women shouldnt change their surname when they marry and how sad it is when you grow apart from a friend after she finds a romantic partner. Happiness is now a concept you find in magazines selling women regressive ideas, Filipovic complains with no apparent irony.
Filipovic graduated from law school, worked as Cosmopolitan.coms senior political writer, and has concerned herself, ostensibly, with social justice for years; surely she has learnt that there are far more honest claims for the exclusions and cruelties of US institutions than that they reflect a profound and abiding antipathy toward womens day-to-day enjoyment.
But it is a typical liberal feminist stance that the status quo needs tweaking instead of complete demolition, and this complicity necessarily limits criticism. Filipovic admits the former (there are . . . a great many ways to improve the status quo) before indicating the latter by concluding that some of womens top concerns should be fostering relationships, promoting sexual pleasure and mak[ing] food feminist.
Oppressive systems
Her faith in the fundamental right-ness of the state is further evidenced by her appeal to government interventions: the day-care system in the United States is terrifyingly underregulated, she says, and advertising for diet products should also be more tightly regulated. If she were willing to even momentarily address oppressive systems directly she might manage more substantial analysis; instead, she is studiously toothless. Capitalism, at least, receives a listing in the index, for its cameo citation: The American pursuit of happiness has morphed . . . into a thoroughly capitalist endeavour. And a few pages later: happiness researchers have reached a number of important conclusions, including that governments influence happiness and human relationships impact happiness. (my emphasis). Well, thank God for science.
Many of todays most visible feminist authors, including Filipovic and her contemporaries Jessica Valenti (Sex Object: A memoir, 2016) and Lindy West (Shrill: Notes from a loud woman, 2016), shaped their style by contributing to funny, gossipy group blogs where articles about Photoshopped actors ran next to posts detailing the latest political attack on birth control.
They established reputations at a time when personal anecdotes counted as much as if not more than actual reporting or quantified information, when stories of individual mens bad behaviour or excoriations of fatphobia reliably went viral, while sober reports on health inequity or our militarized police force, did not. Garnering the maximum number of clicks and shares usually means providing content that is easily digestible and free of the ponderous theorizing that distinguished second wave powerhouses like the late Kate Millett and Shulamith Firestone; a so-called take is more likely to be widely read if the author hasnt thought much about what they are saying, or how they are saying it.
Thoughtlessness may be a feature of any writing generated to satisfy an aggressive publishing pace, and it is only fair to recognize the market pressures that shape womens writing  which is, after all, a livelihood  but allowing ones ideas to stagnate is plainly negligent, especially if you are a corporate media darling with continued access to large platforms. -Times Literary Supplement

India thrash Australia to win ODI series 4-1
Nagpur: Opener Rohit Sharma hit a dominant century as India thrashed Australia by seven wickets in the fifth and final one-day international on Sunday, clinching the series 4-1. Chasing 243 for victory, the hosts rode on Sharma's 109-ball 125 to achieve their target in 42.5 overs at Nagpur and move to the top of the ODI world rankings table.
The Virat Kohli-led side had slipped behind South Africa after their loss in the fourth game but are now number one in the International Cricket Council ratings for ODIs. They were already the top Test team.
It was a disciplined bowling effort led by spinner Axar Patel, who claimed three wickets, that set up India's comfortable victory after restricting the visitors to 242-9.
In reply, Sharma and Rahane made batting look easy on a two-paced track and extended the teams' dominance in the match and the series.
Sharma, who opened his account with two successive boundaries after 14 deliveries, was the first to get to his fifty with a double off Marcus Stoinis.
Rahane also got his fourth successive 50-plus score before being trapped lbw by paceman Nathan Coulter-Nile.
Sharma went on to register his 14th ODI ton during his 99-run partnership with Kohli, who made a sedate 39. He got to his hundred with a six off Coulter-Nile.
Leg-spinner Adam Zampa sent Sharma and Kohli back to pavilion. Kedar Jadhav, unbeaten on five, and Manish Pandey, 11 not out, then saw the team team through.
Earlier, opener David Warner's 62-ball 53 was not enough to inspire Australian batting as they ended on 242-9 after electing to bat first.
Travis Head and Stoinis tried hard to counter a persistent Indian bowling with their 87-run fifth-wicket partnership, but their departure spelt further trouble for the visitors. Head, who made 42, and Stoinis, who scored 46, failed to convert their starts into bigger scores as Australia totally lost steam in the final five overs.
Left-arm spinner Patel returned impressive figures of 3-38 while fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah claimed two wickets. The action now shifts to the three Twenty20 internationals starting Saturday in Ranchi. AFP

Injured Morkel strikes as rain halts SA victory push
Potchefstroom: South African fast bowler Morne Morkel took two wickets for no runs in the first over of Bangladeshs second innings before an injury to the fast bowler and a thunderstorm hit South Africas hopes of an early win on the fourth day of the first Test on Sunday.
Bangladesh were reeling at 49 for three after being set to make 424 to win when a storm hit Senwes Park during the tea break and no further play was possible.
More showers are possible on the final day on Monday and Morkel, who took two for 19, is not expected to bowl again.
He left the field with a side strain after bowling two balls in his sixth over. He is due to have scans on Monday to establish the extent of the injury.
Morkels sensational start could have been even better. He was denied a third wicket because of a no-ball.
Morkel, bowling around the wicket, bowled Tamim Iqbal with his fourth ball, a superb delivery which straightened off the pitch and hit the off stump.
Two balls later he won a leg before wicket decision against another left-hander, Mominul Haque, who made top score of 77 in Bangladeshs first innings.
After consulting batting partner Imrul Kayes, Mominul did not seek a television review of umpire Chris Gaffaneys decision but replays showed the ball would have missed the leg stump.
Switching to over the wicket, Morkel uprooted the middle stump of Mushfiqur Rahim, Bangladeshs right-handed captain, with the second delivery of his next over. But a television check showed the bowler had over-stepped the bowling crease. A no-ball was called and Rahim was reprieved.
It was a world record 14th occasion on which Morkel had been denied a Test wicket because of a no-ball.
South Africa missed another chance when captain Faf du Plessis dropped Kayes at second slip off Kagiso Rabada when the batsman was on six.
Kayes made 32 before he was caught behind off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj in what proved to be the last over of the day.
Du Plessis (81) and Temba Bavuma (71) set up South Africas second innings declaration on 247 for six with a fourth wicket partnership of 142 off 172 balls.
The innings was interrupted for 47 minutes by the first of two thunderstorms.
Part-time left-arm spinner Mominul claimed a career-best three for 27 as South Africa chased quick runs.
He had taken only four wickets in 23 previous Tests.
By contrast, Mehidy Hasan, Bangladeshs only front-line spinner, did not take a wicket and conceded 247 runs in 67 overs during the match - the third-highest number of runs conceded by a bowler without taking a wicket in a Test match, a list headed by South Africas Imran Tahir, who leaked 260 runs against Australia in 2012.
Clearly intent on setting up a declaration which would leave his team with plenty of time to bowl out Bangladesh a second time, Du Plessis showed aggressive intent from the start of his innings.
He reached easily the fastest half-century of the match off 55 balls and went on to make 81 off 101 balls.
Bavuma made a slow start and survived a chance on eight when Kayes dropped a fierce square cut at point off Shafiul Islam.
But he lifted his tempo as he and Du Plessis mixed boundaries with good running between the wickets.
Bavuma faced 105 balls before falling to a sensational catch by wicketkeeper Liton Das , who moved sharply to his left as he anticipated a lap sweep by Bavuma and held the ball at close range with his left hand.

Interbrand releases 2017  Best Global Brands Report
Interbrand, the worlds largest and most influential brand consultancy, has announced the Best Global Brands for 2017.
Now in its 18th year, the theme of this years Best Global Brands report is Growth In A Changing World, and examines three key components: People, Technology and Brands.
The combined total value of the worlds top brands, US$1,871,730 million, is an increase of 4.2% from the previous year while 42% of that amount can be found in the Top 10 brands on the table.
Interbrand has named Apple, Google, and Microsoft as the three most valuable brands in the world, with technology as the dominant sector. This year, the list also features three new entrants: Ferrari at No. 88, and Netflix and Salesforce.com, who make their first appearance on the list, at No. 78 and No. 84.
We are living in one of the most exciting periods of change  societal, technological, industrial  that impacts every aspect of commerce and life, said Jez Frampton, Global CEO of Interbrand. In this ever-shifting context, growth becomes more challenging, which is why businesses need brands more than ever. The Best Global Brands understand that brands are the platform for growth.
For five consecutive years, Apple and Google continue to hold the top positions. Apples brand value grew by 3 percent to US$ 184,154 million, as Googles brand value grew by 6% to US$141,703 million. Microsoft rose to No. 3, as one of 16 brands with double-digit percent growth.
Closely following Coca-Cola at No. 4 is Amazon, Samsung, Toyota, and Facebook, which breaks into the Top 10 for the first-time at No. 8 (up from No. 15 last year). Mercedes-Benz and IBM round out the Top 10. Frampton said the most significant change in the list is the continued rise of technology-centric brands, especially among the Top 10.
The five Top Growing Brands include Facebook (48 percent growth) who leads for the second year running, Amazon (29%), Adobe (19%), Adidas (17%), and Starbucks (16%).
More than half of the Best Global Brands came from four sectors: Automotive (16), Technology (15), Financial Services (12), and Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (9). Retail is the top growing sector in percentage terms (19%), followed by Sporting Goods (10%), Technology (8%), Logistics (7%), and Financial Services (6%).
Commenting on the 2017 annual report, Ashish Mishra, Interbrand India Managing India, said, Growth In A Changing World is best exemplified by South Asian markets which include one of the worlds fastest growth markets and the one that is undergoing maximum change. Our objective through Best Global Brands and the Best Sri Lankan Brands league table launching in November 2017 is to raise the bar for Sri Lankan brands through our global best practices. For example, Samsung, which entered the ranking in 2001 and is now ranked at No. 6 invested heavily in R&D to improve its product.
Second, it developed a brand platform and brand architecture that laid the foundation for all marketing activities. This meant that they could shape peoples perceptions in a coordinated and consistent manner, while creating greater impact and operational efficiencies at the same time.
Michel Nugawela, CEO, MND/Sri Lanka partner for Interbrand, said, Interbrands Best Sri Lankan Brands league table would be modeled on Best Global Brands so the worlds gold standard in brand valuation methodology will be used for the ranking.
As well as providing a rigorously analyzed valuation number, Interbrands methodology also brings together market, brand, competitor, and financial data into a single, value-based framework within which the performance of the brand can be assessed and improved, and the financial impact of investing in the brand quantified.
Interbrands Best Global Brands, the most prestigious brand ranking table globally, identifies the 100 most valuable global brands by analyzing the many ways a brand benefits an organization.
The Best Global Brands methodology was the first brand valuation method to become ISO certified.
The ranking is based on a combination of attributes that contribute to a brands cumulative value: the financial performance of the branded products and services; the role the brand plays in influencing customer choice; and the strength the brand has to command a premium price or secure earnings for the company.

Intervention petition on former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silvas FR filed

Attorney-at-law and public interest litigation activist Aruna Laksiri filed an intervention petition today seeking Supreme Courts jurisdiction to dismiss (in limine) the Fundamental Rights petition filed by former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva who challenged the enactment procedure of Provincial Council Election bill.
On September 28, former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva filed a Fundamental Rights petition today at the Supreme Court seeking an Interim Order by way of a direction that theamendments purported to be made to Provincial Council Election bill at committee stage of the Parliament on September 20 shall not be operative till the final determination of this petition.
Filing an Intervention petition in the Supreme Court, attorney-at-law Aruna Laksiri maintained that the former Chief Justice cannot challenge a bill passed in Parliament since it becomes law when the certificate of the Speaker is endorsed in terms of Article 80 (1) of the Constitution.
A bill passed in Parliament cannot be challenged in Court through a Fundamental Rights petition, the intervention petitioner added.
Aruna Laksiri further stated that former Chief Justice has filed this Fundamental Rights petition in contrary to the provisions of the Constitution and undermining the sovereignty of the people exercised by Parliament.
He further said the Fundamental Rights petition filed by former Chief Justice was erroneous since the Speaker had been named as a respondent in contrary to the Parliamentary Privileges Act.
He further alleged that former Chief Justice is attempting to misuse legal process of the country and moved Supreme Court to dismiss former Chief Justices Fundamental Rights in limine.
In his Fundament Rights petition, former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva sought a declaration that the Fundamental Rights of the petitioner guaranteed by article 12(1) of the constitution has been infringed or is likely to be infringed by the executive or administrative actions of respondents.
The former Chief Justice cited Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya and Chairman and members of Election Commission as respondents.
The former Chief Justice is also seeking a declaration that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is not empowered by law to certify in terms of article 79 of the constitution that the Provincial Council Election Bill which was passed at the second reading by parliament and operative provisions of which were entirely deleted and new provisions purporting to be amendments to the Provincial Council Election Act No.2 of 1988.
The petitioner stated that the government attempted to postpone the said elections by means of the twentieth amendment to the Constitution which was challenged and Supreme Court determined that the bill is inconsistent with the Constitution and should be approved by people at referendum.
The petitioner stated that upon the said determination the government decided not to proceed with the said amendment and decided to proceed with the bill as to the quota of female candidates.

JICA volunteer supports Dehiwala Zoo activities
Sayo Yamao has been working for the National Zoological Gardens (NZG) in Dehiwala for the past seven months. She is one of 71 JICA volunteers currently working in the country in response to requests made by the Government of Sri Lanka. Her assignment at the NZG entails working on animal breeding, enrichment, animal training and healthcare.
Animals in the zoo miss living in their natural habitat and therefore, as a part of their work, zookeepers try to conduct different types of enrichment activities such as habitat, feeding and sensory enrichment programmes to uplift their natural behaviors. It is this activity that Yamao is currently supporting by using her expertise. For example, she has introduced puzzle-feeding activities for chimpanzees, orangutans and tigers, where food is not directly fed to animals, but it is creatively concealed so that animals have to make an effort to find their food. The purpose of this exercise is to reduce the monotony that comes as a result of direct feeding and stimulate the mental and physical activity of animals, whilst trying to reduce the time and motivation for misbehavior. Yamao has also introduced new menus for the animals and is currently training sea lions to perform new tricks at the daily Sea Lion Show.
Yamao conducts activities in collaboration with local zoo keepers who have been motivated by her support, sharing of knowledge and expertise. Whilst mentioning that the local zookeepers are knowledgeable and experienced, she stated that the health of animals could be further enhanced if there is increased interaction between staff at zoo hospital and zookeepers (which would, for example, reduce instances of overfeeding of the animals). She also mentioned that improvement could be brought about by revising the feeding times, wherever appropriate and paying more attention to cleanliness. Yamao is a licensed veterinary nurse who has worked for seven years in a Japanese safari park with both captive and non-captive animals.

Joint ventures, exports, way forward for Lankan manufacturers - PM
There were two sets of Sri Lankan manufactures, one looking at the local market and the other segment targeting exports, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe.
Speaking at the 25th National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) Export Awards held at Hilton Main Ball Room Colombo he said that there should be only one tier and the manufactures concentrating only on the local market should look at exports and the government would offer them all assistance to go global. There should not be a distinction between export and local market.
He said that while the country is targeting over US 3 billion of Foreign Direct investments by 2020 and local entrepreneurs too should look at joint ventures with foreign companies. They must try to take in technology from them and enter the export market.
He said with 20 million people in Sri Lanka there are limitations for local manufactures and they must go global. If Sri Lanka did not export, tea, rubber, coconut and apparel, Sri Lanka would not be enjoying this life style today.
He said that both Japan with two atomic bomb explosions and Korea devastated by a 40 year war developed by concentration in exports. China also development by going for exports.
The premier said that though some may not agree tax rebates alone cannot drive competition. Most countries including China pays more taxes to the government than Sri Lanka. Its the innovation that matters and drives growth, he said.
Wickramasinghe however admitted that there are some gray areas and identified high cost of power as one. He predicted that with wages and other expenses increasing some of the local manufactures would move out of the country.
The Premier also said that they in a bid to increase connectivity and making Sri Lanka a smaller nation, many transport related infrastructure projects were been conducted, these too will help local entrepreneurs. We have also selected over 7,700 acres in Hambantota, Paranthan and Kandy areas especially for industrial development. A further 6,000 acres have been year marked for tourism development.
The Chinese joint venture project for Hambantota harbour development would also create series of new industries and we will also have several new investment zones all over Sri Lanka.
Referring to ancient Ceylon the Premier said that the country has been always an export oriented nation and even Cinnamon grown in the up country was exported from the harbours in the South.

Joyces unpunctuated rigmarole
Joyce was good. He was a good writer. He makes me grumpy a lot, especially Ulysses, but he was good. There are at least twenty irresistible qualities to Ulysses. At or near the top of the stack, at least for me, is the way he traffics in what I call hyperrealistic unnecessaries.
Shakespeare was like that, too. Sprinkled all through his plays are these exchanges that are not at all essential to the plot but that ring true in some surprising way, causing one to turn em over and over in ones mind, pleasurably.
FIRST PLAYER
But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen
HAMLET
The mobled queen
POLONIUS
Thats good. Mobled queen is good.
The above is especially ticklish because Hamlet, a moment before, had sputtered in indignation at Poloniuss having interrupted the players speech. Suddenly, surprisingly, and delightfully, Hamlet himself interruptsand deflates the very speech he was just defending. And then Polonius reverses himself as well!
Moreover, the fact that the whole thing turns on the word mobled raises the pitch well into the exquisite range. (The best Simpsons episodes are full of this kind of thing, as well.)
But to return to Joyce: the unnecessary bits that are just so perfect are everywhere in Ulysses. I want to unpack one of them from my favorite chapter (chapter 1), for the benefit of American readers who have absolutely no idea how traditional British money works. Here is the passage:
Haines said to her:
Have you your bill We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadnt we
Stephen filled again the three cups.
Bill, sir she said, halting. Well its seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. Thats a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir. Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.
Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried:
A miracle!
He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:
Ask nothing more of me, sweet.
All I can give you I give.
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.
Well owe twopence, he said.
Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning, sir.
Every little dot of that is excellent. Mulligans sigh. Hainess smiling banality. The womans uneager hand. But my purpose here, this morning, is to explain the bill. Her unpunctuated rigmarole of numerical spangablasm is, for me, the crown jewel in this passage, the main reason I remember it. But first, a little backstory. Like all other Americans with literature Ph.D.s, I have had the old British monetary system explained to me a hundred times. But the thing is hopeless. Bobs, tanners, groats, florins, crowns, guineastheres quite a few too many of these. Also, there is the error of thinking the pound is the basic unit. Nothing costs a pound; everything costs a shilling.
For me, the only solution was to go to coin shops and purchase actual specimens of the key items mentioned above. Graduate students of America, listen to me! Go online and buy yourself an eighteenth-century shilling. Pay whatever they want. If you simply stare at a shilling (its a handsome coin) for long enough, a lot of your anxieties will relax. As Isaac Watts says: Let Induftry and Devotion join together, and you need not doubt the happy Succefs.
But lets revisit what Mother Grogan (or whatever her name is) says. Well its seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. Thats a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.
Let us not make this any more complicated than it needs to be. Here are the essentials. A shilling is twelve pence. A florin is two shillings. Thus,
(a) A pint of milk for each of seven mornings, at twopence a pint, is fourteen pence (a shilling and twopence over).
(b) But these three most recent mornings, theyve had quarts of milk, which go for four pence each (naturally, since a quart is two pints). Three quarts x four pence = twelve pence, i.e., a shilling.
Having calculated (b), she adds (a) to it: [a shilling, for the quarts] + [one and two, i.e. a shilling and twopence, for the pints] = [two and two, i.e. two shillings and twopence].
Mulligan gives her a florin (= two shillings)thats why they still owe twopence.
Got it Youd probably better read the last few paragraphs over again. Concentrate. Now, obviously the reader is not supposed to follow the original any better than Mulligan does.
Indeed the iggskwizzitness of the passage is bound up in the fact that this humble, uneducated woman thinks rings (for a moment anyway) around these supposedly superior young men. And she does so without aggression or victory, or anything else. Shes mainly wary of them. Just the same, it bothered me for years, knowing that the novels original readers were not nearly as flummoxed as I was. I mean, youre supposed to be bewildered, but not rendered utterly helpless. Splendidly, the reader of the present note now understands the passage as well as anyone alive. Until forgetting sets in, your mind has achieved union, not with that of James Joyce but with that of Mother Grogan, or whatever her name was. -Paris Review

Justice Minister calls for ideas to reform legal system
Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorale said she would welcome ideas and views from the entire legal sector to introduce legal reforms needed for the country and its people and minimise delays in the sector.
Atukorale was speaking at the three-day Junior National Law Conference 2017 at the Amari Hotel in Galle on September 29 after inaugurating the conference.
She said the inordinate delay in hearing of cases to a conclusion had became a serious problem in the courts network and legal reforms were needed to resolve the issue.
"Legal aid and equality of justice were universally accepted human rights. It was important for all courts staff from the highest to the lowest to work with dedication to overcome delays. The Government had already done much work to minimise the delays, Ideas and views of all parties in the legal sector were needed to facilitate legal reforms, she said.
The minister said that in 2015, nearly 18,960 cases were pending in High Courts and that the number increased to 17,038 in October 2016.
Another 3,347 cases were pending in Civil Appeal Courts in 2015. In march, 2017, 5,580 cases were pending in Commercial High Courts and another 16,574 in High Courts, she said.
Administration of Justice should be done efficiently and impartially. If not people would lose confidence in the legal system. As lawyers, it was important to act in a manner that create public confidence in the legal system, she said.
She said the Government always strive to develop legal education and provide necessary facilities and training to the legal fraternity.
Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya, PC, and BASL President U.R. de Silva spoke.

Keells Super customers donate Rs. 2.5 mn towards Little Hearts project
Keells Super announced the completion of a fundraising campaign for the Little Hearts Project, with the donation of Rs. 2.5 million towards the treatment of children diagnosed with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) and critical illnesses.
Proceeds of the fundraising campaign will be utilized to improve high end facilities to treat children at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH), currently the sole medical institution in Sri Lanka that is able to offer such care.
LRH is considered the largest children's hospital in the world with a bed-strength of over 900 and nearly 3,000 patients visiting for outpatient care daily.
These funds will also be utilized to support the construction of 10-storey cardiac and critical care complex dedicated to treat children diagnosed with Congenital Heart Diseases.
It is estimated that over 3,000 children are born with CHD in Sri Lanka per year however the existing wing can only treat up to 1,700 children with CHD annually leading to over 40% of these children being waitlisted and over 60% of all critically ill children lacking immediate access to intensive care.
We are truly grateful to the outpouring of generosity from Keells Super customers towards the Little Hearts Project. This vital act of kindness will contribute towards saving the lives of many patients at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital and help provide these young Sri Lankans with a chance to live a long and healthy life.
Together with the invaluable support of the Little Hearts Project we hope to continue this important work and spark the changes necessary to ensure that all children in this country are always provided with access to the lifesaving medical care they require to have a happy, safe, and healthy childhood, Consultant Pediatric Cardiologist at LRH, Dr. Duminda Samarasinghe said.
Spearheaded by the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians together with a few concerned citizens of Sri Lanka, the Little Hearts Project was established with the goal of combating the deficiency of resources necessary to meet the growing and urgent need for cardiology and intensive care treatments for children.
Pledging its support to this worthy cause in December 2016, Keells Super established a payment method which enabled its customers to conveniently donate towards the Little Hearts Project as they engaged in their day-to-day shopping.
Keells Super also pledged a percentage of revenue of an exclusive range of bakery products earlier this year. The campaign was further supported by collaborative customer awareness building campaigns organized by Keells Super and Little Hearts.

Khuram Sheikhs murder; Appeal  re-fixed for hearing

The Court of Appeal today re-fixed for hearing on February 5 next year, the appeal filed by Attorney General against the sentences imposed on the convicts of British aid worker Khuram Sheikhs murder were not sufficient.
The bench comprised Appeal Justices Devika Livera Tennakoon and S. Thurairajah.
Four convicts former Tangalle Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Sampath Chandrapushpa Vidanapathirana, Lahiru Kalum, Saman Deshapriya and Prageeth Chaturanga who were found guilty of killing British tourist Khuram Shaikh in December 2011 and for raping and brutally assaulting his fiance while holidaying at the tourist resort of Tangalle were sentenced by the Colombo High Court.
While requesting to amend the punishments given to the convicts, the AG also suggested that these convicts should be given death sentence or life imprisonment as they committed the murder using weapons as members of an unlawful assembly.
Through this appeal, the Attorney General maintained that the sentences imposed on the convicts of British aid worker Khuram Sheikhs murder were not sufficient.
The petition also noted that the Judge had reiterated that fourth accused in the unlawful assembly had used a firearm and that in cases of unlawful assembly an offence committed by one applies to all in the group.

KPMG unravels journey towards  Better Business Reporting
There is growing recognition that the range of issues and opportunities affecting long term business value, is much broader than what can be reflected in a set of current year financial measures.
In an effort to even better understand the dynamics of Better Business Reporting (BBR), KPMG inSri Lanka hosted an interactive workshop titled Integrated Reporting: For Better Business Reporting on September 25, 2017 to unravel the journey towards better business reporting and highlight the potential benefits of Integrated Reporting.
Commenting on the event, Reyaz Mihular, Managing Partner, KPMG in Sri Lanka said, the objective of the workshop was to share a big-picture perspective to current corporate reporting and practical insights, on how application of Integrated Reporting principles can help corporates to effectively communicate their business stories.
The workshop was conducted by Michael Bray, Director of Better Business Reporting Group, KPMG Australia and KPMG Fellow in Integrated Reporting at Deakin University, Faculty of Business and Law. Michaels vast experience has been underpinned by a core objective  continually improving business reporting practices. He guides his clients and team towards improving the clarity of corporate reporting and the effectiveness of reporting strategies.
Joining Michael as co-presenter was Dr. Luckmika Perera, Director of Professional Programs and Partnerships at Deakin University, Faculty of Business and Law. He manages all professional programs and executive education, including Integrated Reporting training.
Commenting on the business case for Integrated Reporting, Michael said, Integrated Reporting offers the opportunity to center business reporting on the strategy and value creation process.Some organizations start this transition by enhancing the structure of their narrative reporting, but the true value over the journey is in the adoption of the Integrated Reporting framework as a whole.
The discussion included the following: The potential benefits of Integrated Reporting, Current status of Integrated Reporting in Sri Lanka, Building on current reporting in Sri Lanka towards better business reporting, Integrated Reporting Management Systems and practical examples, Linking sustainability practices to a business model.
The journey to Better Business Reporting, culminating in an Integrated Report prepared under the IIRCs Integrated Reporting Framework, should be of particular interest to CEOs, CFOs and directors as they face the challenge of convincingly telling their organizations story to the markets, so that they can obtain capital at a reasonable cost.
According to Michael, delivering an effective narrative report can be a challenge. It requires a clear vision of what is needed to tell the companys story.
The response so far has been fantastic. There is definitely a keen interest for activating Better Business Reporting, based on the conversations I have had with our clients in Sri Lanka, said Michael.
The benefits of improved business reporting through Integrated Reporting include more efficient capital allocation, streamlined reporting processes, reduced reporting costs and enhanced organizational clarity in terms of business strategy and the business model.
According to KPMGs second annual Survey of Business Reporting, on an evaluation of 270 annual reports from larger public companies in 16 countries, the short-term focus of corporate reporting is readily apparent. The survey highlights that of the reports surveyed: Forty-four percent do not look beyond short-term initiatives when discussing strategy. Only 9 percent provide a 5-year track record of operational performance. Only 11 percent show how a companys risk profile has been managed over time.
The struggle is real and our aim is to bring our hands-on implementation capability, peppered with deep industry expertise to work with clients on their journey towards better business reporting, by implementing and enhancing their Integrated Reporting processes, said Reyaz.

Kusal is the key and we need to bat deep  Herath
ABU DHABI, Sunday: Veteran spinner Rangana Herath believes that Kusal Mendis who is 16 not out will be the key to Sri Lanka getting anywhere close to saving or winning the first Test against Pakistan being played at Abu Dhabi here.
We need to score as much as we can. We cannot say that this is the score that we would like to get at. But we need to bat the first hour off and then go onto till lunch at least and see how much we have, said Herath at the end of the fourth day.
Kusal he is the key. He needs to bat as much as he can. We also have Dickwella and Dilruwan and we need to get to a decent total, he said.
Sri Lanka ended the fourth day on 69-4 to lead overall by 66 runs with six second innings wickets in hand going into the fifth and final day today.
Pakistan managed to gain a slender three-run lead after Herath had produced yet another top drawer performance with the ball.
Already the leading left-arm spinner in the game, Heraths five wickets for 93 took him closer to six wickets from achieving 400 Test wickets.
Actually it was not an easy wicket for the spinners. Until the fourth day, only 24 wickets had fallen in the Test match, said Herath.
It is not easy to pick up five wickets in an innings. As far as I concerned, I am very pleased with the way I bowled.
Herath had a few words of praise for Pakistans debutant Haris Sohail who defied the Lankan bowlers for 224 minutes in compiling a maiden Test fifty.
He showed a lot of character and a lot of maturity for a guy playing his first Test match.
Sohail said that it was a dream for him to play in a Test match following a knee injury which he picked up on the tour to Sri Lanka in 2015 and one that threatened to disrupt his career.
There was pressure and it was a comeback and a debut. The confidence had been shaken over the last two years, but I had good backing from the management, said Sohail.
The last two years were very difficult. I struggled a lot. It was that kind of injury. Things werent right for me. But it was a dream for me to become a Test cricketer and now that is complete.
Apart from scoring a useful 78 that put Pakistan in front of Sri Lanka in the first innings, Sohail also picked up an important wicket by trapping Kaushal Silva lbw for 25 in the Sri Lanka second innings.
You could say it was my best day. Debut, and to start like that, to get wickets, it was a very good day.

Lankan passenger carrying gold in rectum caught at Vizag airport

Customs officials of the Air Intelligence Unit at Vizag Airport detained an international passenger on the charges of carrying gold biscuits in his rectum on Sunday. Refusing to reveal the identity of the passenger, the officials said he had landed at the city airport in a Sri Lankan Airways flight around 9.30 am. 
Initially, it was suspected that he was carrying cocaine, but a senior officer, on condition of anonymity, said the passenger was trying to smuggle gold bars. The person could be carrying around 800 grams of gold, he said. 
Customs officials grew suspicious of the passengers behaviour as he was walking awkwardly and rushed through the green channel meant for passengers carrying non-dutiable goods. Officials detained him and conducted confirmatory screening tests which revealed that he was carrying something in his rectum. Sources identified the passenger as Abdul Razak, 50, who flew in from Colombo. However, officials are yet to confirm the information.
The passenger has been sent to King George Hospital for a total body scanning procedure. Police denied having any official information about the incident.

Sheriff Joe Lombardo of the Las Vegas Police department said the shooter was located on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel on the city's strip.
He said officers shot and killed the suspect, who is a local resident.
Sheriff Lombardo added that police believe the shooting was "a lone wolf" style attack.

Las Vegas shooting: Death toll rises to 50

At least 50 people have been killed and another 200 have been wounded in a mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert.
A gunman, named as 64-year-old local resident Stephen Paddock, opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel towards an open-air music festival.
He was shot dead by officers in the hotel where a number of guns were found.
The attack is the worst mass shooting in recent US history.
US President Donald Trump tweeted his "warmest condolences and sympathies" to the victims and their families, and called the shooting "terrible".
Sheriff Joe Lombardo described the shooting as a "lone wolf" attack. He added that police were now confident they had located a woman, earlier named as Marilou Danley, who was suspected of travelling with the gunman before the attack.
Sheriff Lombardo said he was unable to give accurate details of dead and wounded, but confirmed two off-duty police officers were among those killed.
A local hospital spokesperson said earlier that at least 14 of the injured were in a critical condition.
There had been reports of other incidents at different locations along the Las Vegas strip, but police said those reports were false.
Witnesses reported that hundreds of shots were fired.
Hundreds of people fled the scene and the sound of what appeared to be prolonged automatic gunfire could be heard on videos posted on social media.
Many hotels on the Las Vegas strip close to the scene remained on police lockdown and parts of Las Vegas Boulevard were shut.
People sheltered in hotels, restaurants and at Las Vegas McCarran airport.
A witness, Mike Thompson from London, told the BBC that he saw people running in total panic.
"One man had blood all over him and that's when I knew something was seriously wrong.
"People were running and there was chaos."
Some flights were diverted after news of the incident emerged.
The country music festival had been taking place since Friday at several hotels on the Las Vegas strip.
Nevada has some of the least stringent gun laws in the United States.
People are allowed to carry weapons and do not have to register themselves as a gun-owner.
Background checks are done when people buy guns, but they are also allowed to sell them privately.

Las Vegas shooting sends people fleeing from Mandalay Bay Casino

A gunman opened fire Sunday night at a concert at a Las Vegas casino hotel, sending people fleeing as SWAT units searched for the attacker and the police investigated reports of shootings elsewhere in the city.
Reports said that the shooting happened at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. It was not immediately known how many people were injured. Video posted online showed a musician performing outside the Mandalay Bay at Route 91 Harvest, a country music festival, when the sound of automatic gunfire rang out. The music stopped, and concertgoers ducked for cover. Get down, one shouted. Stay down, screamed another.
Several SWAT teams were sent to the hotel, and officers reported being pinned down by gunfire, according to emergency radio traffic. The police also descended on the Ali Baba Restaurant, about a 10-minute drive from the Mandalay Bay, and they were also investigating reports of a shooting at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino.
The police reported clearing out the Mandalay Bays 29th floor and working their way up to the 32nd floor. A Twitter post from the Las Vegas Police Department described reports of an active shooter near or around the Mandalay Bay casino.
One officer reported that civilians were trying to take patrol cars, but it was unclear why.
The police reported closing off about a mile of Las Vegas Boulevard and asked the public to steer clear of the area.
Police radio reports suggested that at least three people were transported to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center for treatment. The police were told not to bring additional casualties  unless the injuries were life-threatening  to University Medical Center, another nearby hospital, because it was at capacity.

Less tears more cheers for ageing population!
Yesterday Sunday October 1, was International Day of Older Persons. The theme of the 2017 celebrations to mark the event is about enabling and expanding the contributions of older people in their families, communities and societies at large. It focuses on the pathways that support full and effective participation in old age, in accordance with old persons basic rights, needs and preferences.
This years theme underscores the link between tapping the talents and contributions of older persons and achieving the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, which is currently undergoing its third review and appraisal process.
Between 2017 and 2030, the target date for the Sustainable Development Goals, the number of older persons worldwide is set to increase by 58 per cent  from 970 million to more than 1.8 billion. By 2030, the number of people aged 60 and above will exceed that of young people aged 15 to 24.
A golden oldster
The 2017 theme will explore effective means of promoting and strengthening the participation of older persons in various aspects of social, cultural, economic and civic and political life. Surely, it would have been an apt occasion to have assured the elderly in our midst that we recognise their worth and are doing our best to give something back to them for their valuable input to society at large.
After a lifetime of working, raising families and contributing to the success of this nation in countless other ways, senior citizens deserve to be treated with dignity. With people living and working longer, it is increasingly important that we appreciate the consequence of supporting senior citizens within our society.
The ageing process often brings about significant health, emotional, cognitive and social changes. Family members and caregivers should look to the principles of respect and consideration when dealing with the challenges which may accompany this process.
Remember always to treat an elderly person as an adult and an individual. Never be patronizing with them. He or she should be given a patient hearing particularly when it comes to decisions about their life, medication and health. There are some young people who have been brought up the right way by their parents to respect their elders. But unfortunately some of them do not appreciate the elderly or feel they are of any use in todays fast paced world.
Yet even amid this frenzied rat race there are many young people who go out of their way to listen to the wisdom of the elderly or take a genuine interest in the stories the elderly may have to relate about the past. Remember they were young once too and many accomplished a great deal in their lives. One can learn from their wisdom the key to success.
As such, some of them could be considered more productive than their younger less experienced counterparts. Old is gold, claims the ancient hackneyed adage. But how old would one consider too old when it comes to hiring a golden oldster It might come as a surprise to many at what age employers consider people old. In many cases rejected job-seeker oldies are in their 50s and 60s and possibly 70s. Unfortunately in Sri Lanka as a general rule people become retirees around the ages of 55-60.
The respect and care
Many of them are in their prime when they are relinquished to the geriatric paddock.
Ability, experience, good health, temperament and an enterprising streak should be considered above all. Age in such cases is irrelevant. A good many oldsters are far more sprightly, dedicated and possess certain innovative qualities. Add to that vast years of experience and they are unmatchable candidates.
In fact, in many other countries they are asking retired people to think about going back to work in the capacity of their previous jobs to teach the green horns how to do their job. Its a great idea and one that will mesh both the young and old ideas to make for an almost perfect solution to any business problem. Although Sri Lankas intrinsic social values are fairly unique as far as most Asian cultures go, the care and treatment being meted out to a large segment of our greying population has become a worrying trend.
Despite our inherent cultural heritage which subscribes to many religious attributes, such as filial devotion, the respect and care displayed towards the elderly have shown a shocking decline. Although all religious teachers talk about inherent social values, such concepts are fast eroding in Sri Lankan society. True, a great many of these values such as filial devotion and strong family relationships still do exist among a fair section of the population. This is undoubtedly because of the ancient local traditions, where peoples lives centered mainly around religion and the family.
But sadly, these values are eroding, largely because the younger generation chooses to identify with and involve themselves in the almighty rat race.
In the rush towards personal economic success, people are forgetting the importance of all those attributes that are good and decent.
Why should our consumer-orientated, materialistic lifestyle make us lose focus of solid family values so that we, with unmitigated cruelty at times, relegate our parents to the limbo of the forgotten Many religious leaders have expressed grave concern that in this context a fair number of their devotees are no exception when faced by pressures caused by the race for material prosperity.
Several pathetic stories about neglected parents by their offspring have been brought to their attention. Besides acts of shocking neglect are the heart-rending tales of deceit, verbal abuse and even physical violence.
Middle-aged parents
We see around us reprehensible acts of degrading torment for the family elders, who often give up the will to live. Yet often after the death of the victim whose last days on earth have been a living Hell, those same perpetrators make a show of public mourning and provide ostentatious almsgivings. Such pretentious sanctimonious is hard to comprehend. Is economic success, all that important Does it have to take precedence over our own unique set of cultural and moral values, which the Western world views as perhaps ultra-conservative And do we as human beings have to resort to cruelty to the weak and ageing, when what is clearly needed are simple acts of kindness, generosity, thoughtfulness and compassion But what we see around us are many hypocrites who after profiting from parental inheritances - wealth and property at times signed under threats of shocking duress - being treated with appalling heartlessness.
No, we say, some things, such as strong extended family ties, are far more important than economic success and a better standard of living. If in our pursuit of profit and gain we lose sight of our duties and responsibilities towards tour own elderly then it will be a sad day for all of us.
Clearly these middle-aged parents themselves guilty of neglect of their own parents should set an example to their own offspring in respecting their grandparents and the elders among the community. Rest assured that this will only remind them of their own vulnerability and mortality, where the Wheels of God could turn the same cycle. After all, money cant buy happiness nor could one put a value in monetary terms of parental care and love. [emailprotected]

MPs to increase to 233 under mixed system of 60 to 40%
The Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) system proposed in the interim report on constitutional reform will broaden the voters electoral choices, member of the panel of experts appointed by the Constitutional Assembly, legal counsel Suren Fernando said yesterday.
Fernando said with the introduction of the MMP system, each constituency will have a member of parliament. He was addressing a media at a press brief held yesterday at the Government Information Department on the interim report on constitutional reforms.
Counsel Fernando pointed out that the interim report proposes for a Mixed Member Propotional System, which seeks to ensure proportionality of the end result (allocation of seats), while also having directly elected constituency seats. In the meantime, the number of MPs will rise to 233 from the 225 at present.Fernando expressed concern over public opinion with regard to the increase and said the public may not receive the increase well.The said 233 seats will be distributed on a 60 to 40% ratio. Accordingly 140 seats (60%) will be distributed on the First Past the Post (FPP) and 93 seats (40%) as compensatory seats required to ensure that the final result reflects proportionality.
Speaking on voting, Fernando said each voter shall have two votes, both contained in a single sheet. Accordingly, one vote will be for the Single-Member Constituency candidate and the other vote for the party. Fernando alerted the neccessity of anti-manipulation rules in the backdrop of introducing the new system.

New Constitution will not dilute countrys unitary status: PM
The proposed new Constitution will not dilute the unitary status of Sri Lanka in any way. It will seek maximum devolution of power under a unitary state, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister who categorically stated that not a single clause which aims to dilute the countrys unitary status will be included in the new Constitution, added that safeguarding the foremost position afforded to Buddhism and protecting other religions was a prime objective of the government which would never permit a division of the country.
The Prime Minister made this observation addressing UNP activists at meetings at Talawa and Kahatagasdigiliya in the Anuradhapura district on September 30.
The Prime Minister who said that the country existed as unitary state from the D.S. Senanayake era added that its unitary status was legally established in 1972, which sovereignty was vested in Parliament.
Through the 1978 Constitution, the UNP vested sovereignty in the people and the Parliament. In 1987, the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was introduced granting devolution of power within a unitary state without causing any harm to the countrys unitary status. This measure also gained approval in the Supreme Court, the Prime Minister said.

For a new education system
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes declaration that the countrys education system will be modernized, in keeping with the 21st Century, will be welcomed by those who has the countrys future development at heart. This, coupled with his decision to make 13 years of schooling compulsory for every child, no doubt, augurs well for the collective well-being of the younger generation.
Speaking to students and teachers, after visiting Smart classroom at the Sri Jayawardenepura Maha Vidyalaya, the Premier said his government will manage the economy and pave the way for a technology-based education system, in line with the 21st Century.
Admittedly, the countrys education system, as it stands, is meandering along aimlessly, stuck as it is, in the old method. Too much of experimenting, too, by successive governments, has had a negative impact. Educationists and policymakers have failed to ring the necessary changes to fit in with the changing times. We have been producing worthless graduates from an inexhaustible assembly line. Students have been made to digest content from textbooks and regurgitate them at examinations.
Examination oriented education has failed to unravel the hidden capacity of the student, who may be endowed with a multiplicity of talents and capabilities. Mass learning has been the norm, leaving no room for creativity. Day in and day out, subjects are being taught which has no relevance to the demands in the employment market or capacity building of the student. The system has been structured in such a way so as to enslave the student to mere book knowledge, not preparing him for a vocation. It is time that a complete reappraisal is made of the school curriculum and subjects introduced that will make the student relish the time spent at school.
The present education system certainly needs a complete overhaul to match the modern demands and the challenges. Education by rote should be dispensed with and a fresh dynamism introduced to the experience of learning. Topics and subjects that are out of step with the radical transformations that have taken place should be replaced in the time tables. Teacher, pupil relationship too should undergo change and the classroom be made a congenial place, looked forward to by the pupil rather than a place to be shunned. Approach to teaching too should depart from the beaten track.
The whole matter of University education, also, should engage the attention of the authorities and policymakers. Here too, the subject content and the approach should undergo a radical change. Presently, the bulk of our university students are those following subjects in the arts stream and the humanities. Needless to say, they have little prospects for employment, once out in the world. It was revealed that the majority of students who joined the 1971 insurrection were arts graduates who could not seek gainful employment.
Which also begs the question if free education has brought about the expected dividends. Has the countrys free education system only succeeded in producing a young generation not equipped to gain from that education, productively Is the massive amount of money invested to provide free education worth the effort, if no gain is accrued to the country, or the individual
The Premiers decision to make 13 years of compulsory schooling for each child, while commendable, should accompany the changes already mentioned. If not, we will only be adding to the army of unemployed in the country and the attended social problems. There is also the problem of infrastructure and the dearth of teachers. A large number of schools, particularly in the rural areas, are without teachers and most schools are in a deplorable state, some functioning without even the basic amenities, such as drinking water and toilets, as is being frequently reported.
There is also the question of school dropouts. In a majority of cases, economic reasons compel parents to cut short the education of their children, while poverty has also resulted in a considerable number of children not having seen the inside of a classroom. These matters, needless to say, have to be addressed first if the Prime Ministers plan is to succeed. No doubt, the idea to allow 13 years of uninterrupted education for each child would result in the creation of a new generation of educated youth. It would also result in the arrest of the multifarious social ills such drugs, alcoholism and crime, which more often than not, is born out of ignorance. It would also add to the literacy rate, which Sri Lanka takes pride in.
However, mass education would also bring with it other issues such as providing employment. Hence, it is important that the economy is made sound and more and more investments brought into the country for the creation of job opportunities to cater to the new demand. The Premier also made the imported point that the education system should not be changed with the change of government. Since, both main parties were now in government he did not foresee this happening in the immediate future. Both parties, it must be said, have been tinkering with the education system in the past, sending it off direction.

O.J. Simpson freed from jail
Disgraced American football star O.J. Simpson, whose racially charged 1995 murder trial riveted the nation, was released from jail on parole early Sunday after nine years behind bars for armed robbery.
Simpson, 70, left the Lovelock Correctional Center in the western state of Nevada just after midnight local time, prison spokesperson Brooke Keast said. I don't know where he was headed, Keast told AFP.
Simpson was granted parole at a hearing in July and his earliest release date was set for October 1, but he had widely been expected to be freed no earlier than Monday. Why the early release To ensure public safety and avoid possible incident, Keast said, commenting on Simpson's release at eight minutes past midnight (0708 GMT Sunday). Simpson plans to relocate to Florida following his release from the medium-security prison where he has been serving his sentence, Malcolm LaVergne, his lawyer, said. - AFP

O.J. Simpson out of Nevada prison after 9 years

O.J. Simpsonis beginning post-prison life in the city where he committed the crime that saw him locked up.
After serving nine years for a Las Vegaskidnapping and armed robbery,he left prison early Sunday to start a new chapter as a parolee.
Simpson's parole plan was agreed upon at Lovelock Correctional Center prior to his release, Nevada's Division of Parole and Probation said.
"Simpson submitted a parole release plan for a residence in Las Vegas, Nevada. The plan was investigated and approved by the Division of Parole and Probation," it said.
The center did not provide more specifics of Simpson's release plan, saying it was up to Simpson, his family and his attorney as to whether they wanted such information shared.
However, now that theformer NFL staris out of prison, those who know him are not expecting him to become a recluse.
"He's not going to hide," said longtime friend Tom Scotto, who attended Simpson's parole hearing this summer.
Several associates told CNN Simpson would be living in a gated residence with unspecified friends in a wealthy Las Vegas suburb, and planned to move to Florida later on.
"He's going to focus on kids, friends, his family and golf," Scotto said. "Maybe not the first day or second, but he is going to go out."
Two of Simpson's children live in the Tampa Bay area in Florida, one lives in Los Angeles and another in Georgia.
'Don't come back'
Simpson was picked up by a friend shortly after midnight local time Sunday, according to Brooke Keast, a spokeswoman for the Nevada Department of Corrections.
"I told him, 'Don't come back,' and he responded, 'I don't intend to,'" she said. "He was upbeat, personable and seemed happy to get on with his life."
Unlike previous instances, where controversy followed wherever he went, Simpson was released in the middle of the night to avoid media attention.
"Our biggest concern was our safety and the public's safety and not wanting anybody, paparazzi, to follow him," Keast said. "He left through a big blue door through the front gatehouse and exited quietly. He looked down because he didn't want to be photographed."
Meeting with parole officer
Before his release, prison officials did an inventory of what he wanted to take with him or leave behind. He walked out of prison with paperwork and "three or four boxes about the size of a microwave," according to Keast.
Inside the boxes were items such as a hot plate, clothing and shower shoes, she said.
Simpson also met with one person who'll become a fixture in his post-prison life: his parole officer.
"They went over what he needs for parole and where he needs to check in, what he should do to get a driver's license, et cetera, (and) instructions on what to do once he's out there," Keast said.
TheNevada Board of Parole Commissioners voted unanimouslyin July to release Simpson after he served nine years of a 33-year sentence for armed robbery and kidnapping.
During that robbery in 2007, he was part of a group that raided a hotel and casino to steal sports memorabilia at gunpoint. Simpson, a former player for the Buffalo Bills, said the items belonged to him.
No drugs, no alcohol
As a parolee, Simpson will have to meet a number of conditions set by the Nevada parole board.
While out of prison, he won't have the liberty to consume alcohol in large quantities or hang out with ex-convicts. The Nevada parole board forbids parolees from associating with convicted felons and people who engage in criminal activity, or possessing guns and drugs. Alcohol abuse can get a parolee hauled back to prison.
"You are permitt ed to consume alcoholic beverages but not in excess," the conditions of parole supervision read. "You shall submit to a medically recognized test for blood/breath content. Test results of .08 alcohol or higher shall be sufficient proof of excess."
Simpson received a bad score on his parole risk assessment guideline in the drug/alcohol abuse category, with the document citing him for"frequent abuse, serious disruption of functioning."
He testified that he had been drinking alcohol the day of the raid on memorabilia dealers that led to his arrest and conviction.
State of Florida 'objects'
Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote a letter to Florida's Department of Corrections on Friday saying she did not want Simpson to move to her state and asking them to "notify all appropriate authorities of the State of Nevada that the State of Florida objects to the granting of such permission."
But Simpson lawyer Malcolm LaVergne lambasted Bondi over the letter, accusing her of exploiting the issue to score political points ahead of elections.
"One hundred percent Simpson will be able to move to Florida," he said Sunday. "She doesn't have jurisdiction over his move."
But Shawn Arruti, spokesman for Nevada Parole and Probation, said it's not a sure thing.
"Interstate compact is not a guaranteed thing," he said after Simpson's parole hearing in July, referring to an agreement between two states. "Interstate compact is a privilege, but it's a privilege based on meeting certain criteria. And Florida, when they do their investigation, they'll make the determination of whether or not they're going to be willing to accept his case. "
From NFL star to murder suspect
Simpson spent a lifetime in the limelight -- first for his athletic prowess, charm and good looks, then as a murder suspect in the 1994 killing of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman.
His murder trial in Los Angeles was dubbed "the trial of the century" and sparked years of debate over race and justice.
Simpsonpleaded "100% not guilty"and assembled a team of famous local and national lawyers. He was eventually acquitted in 1995, but many questioned whether he got away with murder.
The victims' families filed a suit for wrongful death. Two years after his acquittal, he was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.

Over 920 kgs of seized cocaine worth Rs 16.7 bn to be destroyed
A massive haul of 928 kgs of cocaine seized by the Police and other anti-narcotic bodies over the last two years, which has a value of about Rs 16.7 billion, is to be publicly destroyed this month, Head of the newly formed Organized Crimes and Narcotic Range Senior DIG M R Latheef said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said this would be the first time such a large haul of drugs is to be destroyed openly.
While observing that the cocaine haul is ready to be destroyed, Latheef also said the advice of Attorney General has been sought to destroy 871 kgs of heroin in the same manner. The current value of the heroin haul is Rs 8.7 billion.
We have consulted the AG to destroy the heroin now in the stores of Government Analysts Department after obtaining samples of them for court purposes. As soon as we get the AGs nod we will go ahead with it, he said.
The Senior DIG said there are 1,595 kgs of cocaine in the stores as at present. Out of them, the hauls that have been selected to be destroyed have been found in nobodys possession and therefore they do not belong to any court case. Where necessary we will obtain samples, before destroying the haul, he said.
The decision to destroy the seized drugs now in the Government custody has been reached at a high-level meeting chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena on August 23. The proposal in this regard has been made by Senior DIG Latheef and it has been agreed at the meeting.
Law and Order and Southerb Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, his Ministry Secretary, IGP, Heads of Excise Department, Customs Department and National Dangerous Drugs Control Board, the Navy Commander and the Attorney General attended the meeting at the Presidential Secretariat.
Latheef pointed out the price of a gram of cocaine is about Rs.18,000 and the price of one gram of heroin is about Rs 10,000 as at present.
According to the annual performance report, the Police had raided 36,817 Kg of Ganja, 1,302 Kg of Cocaine, 205 Kg of Heroin, 27 Kg of Hashis, 15 Kg of Opium and 74 grams of Morphine in 2016.
A high-powered body, Organized Crimes and Narcotic Range was set up in August by amalgamating the Police Special Task Force, the Narcotics Bureau and the Organized Crimes Unit to launch comprehensive operations against the drug menace and the underworld.

Pigeons can manage multitasking better than humans
Pigeons are capable of switching between two tasks as quickly as humans - and even more faster in certain situations, despite their small brains, a study suggests.
Researchers performed behavioural experiments to test birds and humans and found that the cause of the slight multitasking advantage in birds is their higher neuronal density.
For a long time, scientists used to believe the mammalian cerebral cortex to be the anatomical cause of cognitive ability; it is made up of six cortical layers, said Sara Letzner from Ruhr-University Bochum in Germany. In birds, however, such a structure does not exist.
That means the structure of the mammalian cortex cannot be decisive for complex cognitive functions such as multitasking, said Letzner, researcher of the study published in the journal Current Biology.
The pallium of birds does not have any layers comparable to those in the human cortex, but its neurons are more densely packed than in the cerebral cortex in humans.
Pigeons, for example, have six times as many nerve cells as humans per cubic millimetre of brain, researchers said.
The average distance between two neurons in pigeons is fifty per cent shorter than in humans, they said.
As the speed at which nerve cell signals are transmitted is the same in both birds and mammals, researchers had assumed that information is processed more quickly in avian brains than in mammalian brains.
They tested this hypothesis using a multitasking exercise that was performed by 15 humans and 12 pigeons.
In the experiment, both the human and the avian participants had to stop a task in progress and switch over to an alternative task as quickly as possible. The switchover to the alternative task was performed either at the same time the first task was stopped, or it was delayed by 300 milliseconds.
In the first case, real multitasking takes place, which means that two processes are running simultaneously in the brain, those being the stopping of the first task and switching over to the alternative task.
Pigeons and humans both slow down by the same amount under double stress.
In the second case - switching over to the alternative task after a short delay - the processes in the brain undergo a change.
The two processes, namely stopping the first task and switching over to the second task, alternate like in a ping- pong game.
For this purpose, the groups of nerve cells that control both processes have to continuously send signals back and forth. The researchers had assumed that pigeons must have an advantage over humans because of their greater nerve cell density. They were, in fact, 250 milliseconds faster than humans.

He said a new growth model based on the private sector being the locomotive for economic development with exports and investments Including FDI as key pillars.
Increasing the advantages of our strategic location in the Indian ocean, diversifying our exports and enhancing trade facilitation will be imperative in promoting sustained growth and development, he said.
The CB Governor also said the countrys investment promotion is boosted through Task Forces to improve the East of Doing Business and a more effective one stop shop.
He said the trade facilitation is being boosted through a single electronic window in Customs and focused attention towards Economic and Trade Cooperation Agreement with India and similar arrangements with China and Singapore.
The governor also stated about the advantage of the opportunities offered by GSP Plus, anti dumping legislation and trade adjustment package to boost competitiveness of local business and retraining of workers.
Dr. Coomaraswamy also appreciated the invaluable service rendered by the OPA during the past 42 years and said this organization is providing a platform for the professionals to contribute to the development in the country.

Ruthless United States on brink of Presidents Cup win
JERSEY CITY, New Jersey, Saturday: The International teams Presidents Cup hopes were hanging by the slimmest of threads after the United States claimed six of eight matches in a cut-throat display on Saturday to sit on the brink of a seventh successive title.
Only a one-up victory by Indias Anirban Lahiri and South Koreas Kim Si-woo over Kevin Chappell and Charley Hoffman denied the United States a sweep of the afternoon four-balls to put celebrations at a breezy Liberty National on hold.
It also kept the Internationals of suffering the ultimate embarrassment of watching the trophy claimed on a Saturday for the first time.
The United States have a commanding 14-1/2 to 3-1/2 lead and need just one point from Sundays 12 singles matches.
Weve just come up against a juggernaut of an American team that has not put a foot wrong, said International captain Nick Price. They have had all the momentum and weve had nothing. Theres an outside shot tomorrow and the guys all know that.
They are going to go play for their pride, they are going to play for themselves, they are going to play for the team and they are going to play for us.
Youre not going to be able to take the spirit away out from our team, thats for sure.
Despite failing to clinch, it was another ruthless performance from the U.S., who won three of four foursomes matches and halved the other then followed up by prevailing in three of the four-ball contests. The U.S. had looked poised to run the table on Saturday after Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed claimed a 2&1 decision over Australian Jason Day and South African Louis Oosthuizen, before Daniel Berger and Justin Thomas beat Venezuelas Jhonattan Vegas and Japans Hideki Matsuyama 3&2. Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka then secured a 3&2 victory over Australian Marc Leishman and South African Branden Grace before the spotlight fell on Chappell and Hoffman in the last match of the day.

Schools reopen in Rakhine, but Rohingya still flee
MYANMAR: Myanmar has reopened schools for ethnic Rakhine children in townships hit hard by recent communal violence declaring stability has returned, state-backed media said Sunday, but thousands of Rohingya Muslims remain on the move from the same areas.
Rakhine state has been torn apart after unrest erupted in late August, when raids by Rohingya militants sparked a massive army crackdown which the UN says is tantamount to ethnic cleansing.
Half of Rakhines roughly one million Rohinyga Muslim population has fled to Bangladesh since then, creating the worlds largest refugee crisis, alleging their villages were incinerated by the army and Rakhine mobs.
Violence has also displaced nearly 30,000 ethnic Rakhine, who are Buddhists, and Hindus inside the state. Education officials said schools had reopened in Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships as stability returns in the epicentre of the violence, according to a report by the Global New Light of Myanmar on Sunday.
Schools in ethnic villages were safe and secure, it said in an apparent reference to areas populated by the Buddhist Rakhine who are recognised as one of Myanmars official ethnic minorities.
But we need to think about schools in Bengali villages amid ongoing security fears, Rakhine education authorities were quoted as saying.
The Rohingya are not recognised as an ethnic group and are instead labelled by the state as Bengalis, stripping them of legal status in Myanmar.
More than 2,000 Rohingya -- many from Buthidaung -- have massed on the coast over the last week hoping to make the dangerous transit to Bangladesh as basic supplies dry up and they receive threats from their Rakhine neighbours.
The government has said officials have tried to talk them out of leaving, but they remain determined to make the perilous journey.
At least 60 people were feared dead, mainly children, after boat capisized agonsingly close to the Bangladeshi shore Thursday carrying Rohingya from the Buthidaung area.
Access to violence-hit northern Rakhine is tightly controlled by Myanmars army, preventing independent reporting by global media and assessment by aid agencies.
On Monday UN representatives are set to join relief agencies and diplomats on a government-steered trip to Rakhine -- their first to the conflict-battered area.
Myanmar scrapped the trip last week citing bad weather. - AFP

Severe water scarcity looms over Anuradhapura people
People in Anuradhapura fear that they will not receive drinking water in the near future. The city has over 300,000 population who now undergo severe drought.
The Mahaweli Water Control Committee and the Mahaweli Authority supply water to Nuwarawewa, Thuruwila and Tisawewa responding to the requests made by the Anuradhapura GA, Water Supply and Drainage Board (NCP) and the Irrigation Authorities, Chief Irrigation Engineer Jayantha Silva said.
"We requested to provide 8,000 acre feet (a.f.) of Mahaweli water to the Nachchaduwa tank. The tank will retain 5000 a.f and release the balance to the Nuwarawewa through a feeder canal," he said. "We have arranged to get 1,000 a.f of water from the Nachchaduwa to Nuwarawewa. Nuwarawewa water has gone down to 6,000 a.f where it should have been 36,050 a.f. It is hardly enough to supply drinking water to the city and its suburb," Anuradhapura Irrigation Engineer P.U.K. Tilakaratne said.
Plans are afoot to get water from the Malwathuoya anicut area if the drought continues. A spokesman of the board said water would be pumped to the Nuwarawewa Purifying Plant though a three km long pipe line.
At present, 15, 000 cubic metres of water is purified and provided daily from the Nuwarawewa.

Six suspects including Dan Priyasad remanded till October 9
Six suspects who were arrested by police in connection with a mob attack on a group of Rohingya refugees who were seeking shelter at a United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) safe house in Mount Lavinia on Tuesday (26), have been remanded until October 9 by the Mount Lavinia Magistrate.
The latest suspects arrested include Liyanage Abeyrathne and Suresh Priyasad alias Dan who goes by the moniker Dan Priyasad. Prior to his arrest Dan Priyasad had posted on this social media page saying that Police had visited his home to arrest him but he was in hiding.
Police have also arrested a 24-year-old woman, who has been identified as Kalyani Podi Menike, a resident of Ratmalana for taking part in the attack. The others who are in remand custody include Janitha Niroshana Deepagey, Nawalage Don Chinthaka Sanjeewa and Nanayakkara Godakanda Kankanamlage Gayan Madushanka Senevirathne.
Thirty-one Rohingya refugees, mostly women and children who were seeking shelter in a UNHCR safe house in Mount Lavinia came under an attack by a mob who stoned the shelter prompting the refugees to leave the premises. The refugees who were detained in April this year by the Navy are presently seeking shelter at the Boosa Detention Camp in Galle to ensure their security following this incident.
An order has also been issued by a court in Galle preventing any form of protests around the Boosa detention camp. The order was issued after threats by some groups who wanted to stage a protest against the Rohingya refugees being given protection at the camp.

SLT opens SEA-ME-WE 5 station today in Matara
Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) will open the SEA-ME-WE 5 undersea cable systems full landing station in Matara, today.
Landing this international cable at Matara will be a key milestone as well as a landmark for the telecom industry of Sri Lanka as well as the whole country.
This is a globe joint venture which is costing US 35 million and involving 14 other countries. The investment from Sri Lanka Telecom towards this joint venture would be Rs. 7 billion said Kumarasinghe Sirisena Chairman Sri Lanka Telecom.
Kumarasinghe Sirisena,Chairman Sri Lanka Telecom
He said several other regional countries wanted this landing station installed in their countries but due to professional approach by Sri Lanka Telecom and most importantly the location of Sri Lanka helped to secure this project for Sri Lanka.
The SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable system, spanning around 20,000 km, will offer a POP to POP solution from Singapore, all the way to Europe via France and Italy.
He said in addition to getting foreign exchange by providing services the project when fully loaded, the system would be able to carry 24 terabits per second; the equivalent of transmitting around 4,800 high-definition movies every second.
This global project will have a positive impact on the overall growth of the countrys economy as high speed broadband environment will encourage higher GDP, enhanced exports, increased productivity, inward migration and modernizing of other sectors.
It would also be a major boost to government plans for digitalization, increase Wifi and also to increase computer literacy.
Due to these high speed Sri Lanka will be the most preferred destination in the region for BPO and Data Center operations.
Sirisena said that in addition the SLT has also secured a deal to build operate and manage a cable depot in Galle.
This would be a joint venture with a Singapore based cable ship company and they will utilize Galle harbor for their operations.
The SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable system, spanning approximately 20,000 km, will offer a POP to POP solution from Singapore, all the way to Europe via France and Italy.
With this global initiative, SLT will further strengthen its position as the only ICT solutions provider in the country having multiple global connectivity options with a gigantic bandwidth capacity that is adequate to cater to the requirements for more than 25 years ahead.
President Maithriala Sirisena would launch this project today at 6 p.m. in Matara.
SLT flags off South Asias first Submarine Cable Depot today
Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) will flag off South Asias first state-of-the-art Submarine Cable Depot project in Galle today as the company has been given the opportunity to build, operate and manage this venture.
SLT will operate this cable depot as Galle Submarine Cable Depot Private Limited (GSCDPL) with IOCPL (Indian Ocean Cableship Pte Limited) which is a ship service provider for SEAIOCMA (South East Asia & Indian Ocean Cable Maintenance Agreement). IOCPL is a Joint Venture Company of Singtel Singapore and Orange France.
Newly formed GSCDPL will be a depot service provider under the SEAIOCMA from 2018 January 1, onwards.
SEAIOCMA is the international consortium for maintaining the undersea cables.
Through this operation in the South Asian region, SLT believes in the possibility of bringing in foreign currency to strengthen the countrys economy in the future, said Kumarasinghe Sirisena, Chairman Sri Lanka Telecom. Sri Lanka is an important destination where multiple cable systems are already in operation passing the country. Sri Lanka will be the only Submarine Cable Depot in the South Asian region.
SEAIOCMA is an agreement among the telecom submarine cable operators, cable ship operators and cable depot operators for providing submarine cable maintenance spanning in an area between Djibouti in the west, Perth in the South, Guam in the East and the northern tip of Taiwan. Prior to this initiative, Singapore was overlooking the Submarine Cable Depot to facilitate international cable systems.
The Galle Port has been selected to set up a submarine cable depot by the cable consortium with the participation of a number of countries and Sri Lanka will facilitate the cable maintenance ship berth and warehouse facility.
Due to this project the Galle harbour too would earn addition revenue offering various additional services for its ship which would be stationed there. (SS)

## Title: Snail Mail Me Your Emails

Snail Mail Me Your Emails
Last week, when I realized technology was turning me into a 'pancake' making me more stupid than I need be, I kept away from my smartphone and laptop as much as I can. Trying to get back to the days when internet was unheard of, when I dutifully wrote letters to my grandmother and uncles and aunts, yesterday I started to write a letter to one of my former lecturers who refuses to have anything to do with electronic mail (my usual mode of contacting her was through her daughter who uses email). Alas, I found myself staring at the A4 page in front of me feeling as though I fell through the hole along with Alice. When I finally managed to write the first few words, my handwriting looked worse than that of my eight-year-old.
It appears I am not the only one who has lost touch with the art of letter writing. Think about it. In the past few days you may well have scribbled out a shopping list on the back of an envelope or stuck a Post-it on your desk. Perhaps you added a comment to your childs report or made a few quick notes during a meeting. But when did you last draft a long text by hand How long ago did you write your last proper letter, using a pen and a sheet of writing paper Isn't it true that, like the rest of us, you have switched completely from writing to typing
Even though no one can say precisely how much handwriting has declined, a British survey of 2,000 people gives some idea of the extent of the damage. According to the study, one in three respondents had not written anything by hand in the previous six months. On average they had not put pen to paper in the previous 41 days. People undoubtedly write more than they suppose, but one thing is certain: with information technology we can write so fast that handwritten copy is fast disappearing from our lives.
Accordingly, in a recent Wall Street Journal article on The Lost Art of the Handwritten Note author Philip Hensher addresses how our increasing reliance on typing and texting is making the handwritten note go the way of the fax machine. He says, "The ready communication through electronic means that has replaced the handwritten letter is wonderful. But we have definitely lost something here, and those Skype, email and text exchanges won't be treasured in the way that my teenage letters, scribbled journals and postcards have been for years." I couldn't agree more. Recently, when moving houses, I unearthed a shoebox full of handwritten notes from old friends, fans of my articles and authors whose books I had reviewed, including the late, legendary Tissa Abeysekera. Had those been sent to me via email or text, I definitely would not still have them - and they wouldn't have had the same sentimental value.
I have often heard young people ask if,after a job interview or informational meeting, they should send a thank you via email or snail mail. Experts suggest they should do both. The speed of an email foll0w-up is great but it can often get buried in a busy person's in-box (or even get lost in the "junk mail" folder if you're sending it from an unfamiliar email address). In this day and age, when sadly we're getting fewer and fewer letters in the mail, a handwritten thank you note, well-crafted on good stationary, will make a candidate stand out from others who chose not to take that extra, personal step.
This might be harder for those who are younger than us, who have grown up in an entirely digital world. A world in which Hallmark stores barely exist because people now send e-vites and e-cards. Where getting on the phone with their school friends seems foreign when they could just make plans via text messages and Facebook. And where every student has a laptop, smartphone - and likely even a tablet device - before they have gotten through their teen years.
But there is still something to be said for taking the time to hand-write your thoughts - whether it be your feelings for a loved one, condolences for a friend who has experienced a loss, or a thank you to someone who has taken the time to help you with your career - and send that real letter or card through the good old Sri Lanka postal service (they could certainly use the business). Moreover, research has shown that the general act of writing by hand can promote quite a few physical and mental benefits, from improving learning abilities to fostering a more positive outlook on life.
So, let's not lose the art of letter writing completely lest our memories and sentiments disappear into Internet purgatory when our in-boxes automatically delete old files. Whether you are trying to cultivate a little romance, nurture a friendship or simply stay connected with loved ones lets send a letter or postcard once in a while. And, yes, if I could have hand-written and posted this story to all of you who are reading it right now, I would have. And I would love to invite you to give me your feedback via handwritten letters too, but I guess like rainbows, snail mail shouldn't happen all the time.

1. No one likes an empty mailbox
Have you ever gone to your mailbox filled with the expectation that it will be filled to the brim with lovely letters and then, upon opening, find only a flyer for pizza If this sounds familiar, never fear for the solution is as creative as it is easy! Simply write to your friends and relatives and favorite celebrity. I can't promise that Beyonce will write back but a girl can dream. Even though your celebrity of choice may not respond, it's likely your friend at school wants to receive mail as much as you do and will, therefore, be a committed pen pal. Say goodbye to that empty mailbox!
2. Stamps!
Contrary to popular belief, stamps are not just for that one kid in school who had a collection. Shout out to the Postal Service for providing us with creative decoration for our handwritten letters.
3. Save them as a keepsake
If you start now, you can document this transformative time in your life through letters between you and your chosen recipient. Eventually, you'll have a collection of memories that you can reflect on in your golden years.
4. You'll become more thoughtful
I believe we've all sent a text that, upon further inspection, could have been worded better. Well, one of the benefits of the written word is that we tend to think more critically when writing something on that very expensive stationery than we would when sending a quick text. Through snail mail, you'll become more thoughtful with your words. Who knows, maybe you're the next Wordsmith and you just haven't realized because you've been sending poorly constructed text messages.

Sri Lanka have a fight on their hands to save Test
ABU DHABI, Sunday: A Test match that looked like drifting towards a draw was suddenly brought to life by two part-time Pakistani bowlers who picked up a wicket each to have Sri Lanka struggling at 69 for four wickets in their second innings  an overall lead of 66 with six wickets in hand and 90 overs of play left on the fifth and final day today.
Asad Shafiq (off-breaks) struck the first blow when he enticed Lahiru Thirimanne (7) into a forward stroke and the resulting edge was held by wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed. Shafiq was brought into complete the unfinished over of Hasan Ali who had to leave the field due to cramps and the bowler obliged Pakistan with the wicket of the Lankan vice-captain.
Debutant Haris Sohail (left-arm spin) another part time bowler then had Kaushal Silva lbw for 25 playing an uncharacteristic sweep shot to a ball that would have gone on to hit middle and off.
These two quick wickets proved a setback for Sri Lanka who have a fight on their hands to save this Test after putting on a marathon batting effort in the first innings to score 419.
Everything depends on how long the Lankan batsmen can occupy the crease and the amount of runs they can put on the board that would safeguard them from defeat. At the wickets are Kusal Mendis on 16 and nightwatchman Suranga Lakmal on 2.
In fact Sri Lanka should not have lost a wicket as early as the 10th over in their second innings had not Dimuth Karunaratne suffered from a brain fade and walked off without reviewing a catch that never came off his bat.
Karunaratne was given out caught off bat-pad by short leg fielder Masood at 10 to a delivery from Yasir Shah in his first over. But replays showed that Karunaratne had not nicked the ball but only jammed his bat onto the ground. However to everyones surprise he decided to accept the umpires decision and walk off.
Manager Asanka Gurusinha said that Karunaratne heard two noises and that was why he decided to walk thinking that he had nicked the ball.
Yasir came back later in the day to strike a telling blow by having first innings top scorer Dinesh Chandimal caught at slip by Shafiq for seven to finish the day with figures of 2 for 25. He will be the danger man for Sri Lanka today especially on a wearing final day pitch.
The early dismissal of Azhar Ali for 85 as early as the 11th over of the day, enabled Sri Lanka to reduce Pakistan to 340-8, but then again the frailties of the Lankan bowling were exposed as they failed to clean up the tail.
Instead they allowed the tail to wag that saw the last two Pakistan wickets flourish to the tune of 82 runs before they were eventually dismissed for 422, a slender lead of three.
The batsman who frustrated the Lankan bowlers was debutant Haris Sohail who played a cultured innings of 76 off 161 balls (7 fours, 2 sixes) and was the last to be dismissed.
In the time he was at the wicket Sohail figured in a half-century partnership with Hasan Ali who made a useful 29 off 25 balls (3 sixes) and a further 32 runs for the last wicket with Mohammad Abbas (1 not out off 34 balls).
Rangana Herath not for the first time was the stand out bowler for Sri Lanka. The veteran left-arm spinner in the sunset years of his career took his 32nd five-for (5/93 off 40 overs) and moved to within six wickets of completing 400 Test wickets and five of reaching a century of wickets against Pakistan in Tests.
His current tally stands at 394 wickets from 84 Tests and he could either achieve it in the Pakistan second innings of this Test or in Sri Lankas first ever night Test which begins at Dubai on October 6.
Supporting Herath in the stifling heat were seamers Nuwan Pradeep and Suranga Lakmal who bowled with great heart to be rewarded with two wickets apiece for their efforts.

Sri Lankan refugee held by Australia found dead

A Sri Lankan refugee who was being detained by Australia in Papua New Guinea has been found dead.
The Tamil man, 32, died in a suspected suicide after receiving treatment for mental illness, refugee advocates said.
Australia controversially holds refugees and asylum seekers who arrive by boat in centres on PNG's Manus Island and the Pacific nation of Nauru.
Nine detainees have died since 2013 - including six at the Manus centre, which is due to close this month.
The latest death - the apparent suicide of a refugee - happened in Lorengau General Hospital early on Monday, Manus Island police commander David Yapu told the BBC.
In a brief statement, Australian authorities said they were "aware of the death" and directed questions to PNG.
In August, an Iranian asylum seeker, Hamed Shamshiripour, was alsofound dead on Manus Island.
Australia has said the centre will close by 31 October after a PNG court ruled it was unconstitutional to detain people there.
Last month,the US acceptedthe first of up to 1,250 refugees under a resettlement deal. Washington may ultimately approve fewer than that after vetting, and Australia has not said what will happen to those left behind.
In September, Canberraagreed to payA$70m (40m; $55m) to refugees and asylum seekers who said they had suffered mental and physical harm in detention.
Australia has frequently defended its offshore policy against criticism by maintaining it prevents deaths at sea and discourages people smugglers.

This program is not only limited to school children but it also covers Pirivena students and students who are engaged in other religious institutes, added the President addressing the launch of Suraksha at Temple Trees.
Successive governments, he said have made it their policy to strengthen free education, to provide all facilities to students and schools in the hope that they are contributing to the creation of an educated future.
Education is a long term investment and it has no limits, said President Sirisena.
The President in jest also quipped that the insurance scheme was no license for children to hurt themselves.
Our expectation is to save you from accident, to have you healthy and make secure our roads, schools, school grounds, and homes, said the President.

He has often been dubbed as the Dream Boy of the Youth. Though he did not win the Superstar crown Shihan Mihiranga Bennet became the most popular music icon among all the young vocalists who have taken part in the reality shows related to singing in Sri Lanka. Throughout the ups and downs of his journey towards fame and fortune Geshni Clementa Silva has been by his side. She finally came to the limelight as the couple tied the knot nine years into their relationship.

Shihan performs his duties as a husband and father very well. He helps me keep our house neat and tidy whenever he is at home. He also handles matters which concerns the boys. He does not laze around and let me do my thing if he is at home but always takes part in whatever I am engaged in. He is especially good at cooking. So at times he handles matters in the kitchen. Whatever he whips up are really yummy.
Success formula
I believe that it is bit of everything which made Shihan succeed. Everything from the way he dresses to how he performs has gained him celebrity status. His voice is exceptional especially because it has the ability to touch the hearts of music enthusiasts.
The meeting
Shihan and I met each other while we were schooling at De Mazenod College, Kandana. He is three years senior to me. He told me that he has had a crush on me from childhood. However he revealed his feelings only when I got into my G C E O/L classes.
It was one of his female colleagues who told me about Shihans feelings towards me for the first time. I acknowledged it with an ok. Once he got the green light Shihan got permission from both parental parties and we got into a relationship amid their blessings in 2003. Nine years later we tied the knot in 2012.
The attraction
I was able to form a good judgment about Shihan because our relationship lasted for such a long time. Surprisingly we had different interests. However once we began living under one roof I began to like some of the things which interested him and vice versa.
We actually did not go out with each other till around two or three years after I left school. Shihan became a household name at that time. He was recognized everywhere he went. Therefore we could not go out and speak to each other much since people would recognize him and become curious. He would visit my place most of the time and that is how we got to know each other. We did not tell about our relationship till we decided to get married.
The marriage
Shihans mother, Nilu Mallika, wanted to go and stay with his sister, Shanika, in Australia for a year. Since he believed that it was the ripe age to marry he decided to take the plunge rather than wait for another year till his mother returned. He popped the question and we got ready in about two weeks for the wedding. It was a simple church ceremony. We both wanted a small wedding because there were too many people to invite if we went for a grand ceremony. We got married on January 26, 2012, at Nayakakanda Church in Handala.
The two other Shihans in their life
Both our sons first name is Shihan. It is something we decided on before they were born. The eldest, Shihan Klein Marsh, was born in 2013. He is four years old now. The second, Shihan Kennan Yaash, was born the following year. He is three years old. We call them Marsh and Yaash. If we had gotten a daughter she would have been named after me. The boys are also into music at such an early age. We have gifted them with a guitar and they spend most of their time playing that and singing.
Coping with difficulties
Shihan faced a lot of enmity and threats during the time he was at the height of his popularity while taking part in Sirasa Superstar Season One. I gave him the full freedom to do what he wanted during that period. I did not cling onto him because that was a testing time for our relationship as well. If Shihan was the sort of person who would abandon me for his new found popularity then I wanted him to take that chance and leave me. But he did not do that. Our relationship stood the test of time and grew stronger. Shihan still relates that one of the reasons why he married me was because I put no restrictions on him.
Shihan also got some death threats while he was taking part in the program. He did not reveal many of those details to me. I found out about them only after the storm has passed. He has the strength to face such situations. Such things do not scare him. If he has something to say to a person he says it to his or her face. I believe that many people who opposed him began to like him due to these qualities.
The vocalist, lyricist and music composer
In my opinion Shihan is equally talented in all three fields. It is the whole package which made him what he is today. Though he has sung lyrics penned by others to melodies composed by another, I think his uniqueness comes from doing all three together.
No album number 3
It has been about nine years since Shihan launched his last album Dreamz 2  My Life. He stopped compiling albums because albums by artistes are usually available at Pettah even before they are launched. He was very disappointed about this and decided to refrain from making another album. However his fans have kept on asking for new songs so he released several solo tracks.
His undying fame has mostly to do with fortune. People really love him for some unexplainable reason. Though he has not done an album recently he is still active in the field as he takes part in musical shows and programs. He composes music and lends his voice for others songs. His last solo track was Obage Mathaken which was launched a couple of years ago.
Her favourite song of his
There are several songs of his which I love like Sulangak Wela and Obage Mathaken. However my favourites are among some songs which he has composed but not released yet. There are several songs which he has done on behalf of other vocalists which I love as well. I really love those songs because the combination comes out very well when he sings, writes lyrics and sets the melody for a track.
Most romantic gesture
Whether Shihan is into romance or not depends on the time and his mood. He has given me surprise gifts in the past. He once composed a song especially for me on one of my birthdays. It is called Oba Dutuwa A Dine which was included in his first album Dreamz of Shihan.
Other passions
Shihan loves cooking. He has a dream of establishing a restaurant one day. He also loves gardening. He has a studio attached to our home and that keeps him busy.
Foodwise
Shihan loves the pork curry that I make. He also likes to eat a lot of veggies. He is pretty much a rice and curry person. My taste in food used to be different. Pre marriage I used to be into junk food and Chinese. Now I too have taken a liking towards rice and curry. Dining out, we normally go for Chinese and Indian food.
Best and worst qualities
Shihan is very blunt. If he has something to tell you, he would say it to your face. That is the most positive thing about him. The worst would be his temper. He used to be quite hot tempered a few years ago. It was not easy to calm him down. If he gets irritated at me or something else I would keep my distance and let him be till he cools off. However in recent times he has tamed his temper. Now he rarely flared up.
Fan base
Fans have always been supportive towards Shihan. There have been a few minor incidents in which some of them have been over enthusiastic about him and had phoned him regularly. Now his fans even chat with me. They also phone to wish the boys on their birthdays too.

Through the trammels of life : Aspirations reached against all odds
Eighty-year-old Kiyoko Ogawa was born in a small town in Japan known as Niigata, a town so obscure that it was only known to the world after the Tsunami in 2011. Her life too though persevering, would have been lived unnoticed if not for a chance acquaintance in 1994 which introduced her to an education system in an island nation which was not delivering equally to all its citizens.
Ogawa has visited Sri Lanka 42 times, more frequently than she has visited Niigata and in 2000, she used her savings to set up the Madam Kiyoko Ogawa Scholarship Fund. Initially set up with Rs. 6 million or 10,000 Yen, it awards bright, underprivileged students in their A/L classes a sum of Rs. 2,000 per month (for 24 months) to complete their schooling.
Since 2000, 382 students have benefitted from the fund.
The fund also has a strict selection criteria such as; applications must be called through the principals of the schools and the zonal director of education and followed by recommendation by the Grama Niladhari. Students who have obtained the highest marks at their O/L exams, students who have lost both or one of their parents, the number of school-attending siblings and students who have achieved reasonable results and their parents having no employment are also criteria for selection.
Growing up
To understand why an 80-year-old Japanese woman would take such interest in Sri Lanka, one must first know the story of how her life came to be. Born in 1938 to a family of eight children, she was the 6th among her siblings. Her father, a rice farmer, worked in an agricultural cooperative and often had to struggle to make ends meet with his large family.
Life was hard growing up. My mother was similar to Oshin, she said, evoking the famed Japanese television character who battled all odds to become successful.
My older sisters got married early and they brought their husbands too to live with us as it was our tradition. And though my family was big, we did not stay together for long, with time, each of them moved out in search of work in factories. My older siblings only completed schooling up to grade 6, recalled Ogawa.
They went to work in factories in the Kansai region, 600 km away from home.
With the end of the second World War, the Japanese government determined to rebuild the country, made schooling compulsory for all and this allowed Ogawa, unlike her siblings, to complete her education until Grade 9, before she had to go look for work in a factory. At 15, she started working at a thread manufacturing factory.
Two years later, she received a telegram from home asking her to return; her parents needed her help. She dutifully returned, but soon got bored and hated staying at home; so six months later, she once again packed her bags and left, this time to the big city, Tokyo.
I had no money in hand, just what I had borrowed for my eight-hour trip. And I left with just the clothes on my back, she said, having left on the premise that a job had been arranged for her there as a maid.
In Tokyo, she looked after three young children for a salary of 1,000 Yen a month in 1955. The average salary of an office worker was 13,800 Yen per month.
But since my food and lodging was covered and they gave me clothes twice a year, I saved up all my salary, explained Ogawa.
At this time, I also figured that I was not too pretty and that I would probably not be able to get married. I could not go back home, so I decided to concentrate on work. I wanted to be a professional, so I looked for a job as a trainee in a factory.
But as fate would have it, she found work as a trainee at a tailor shop. So she made up her mind to learn to make clothes, which she did for four years. In the meantime, she also worked part-time as a dishwasher in a caf to earn extra. Her goal was to save up enough to be able to afford her own apartment.
Japan, however, was a very traditional society at the time and a woman living on her own was frowned upon. Her friends and family discouraged her from moving out on her own and a distant relative suggested that she come work for him in his dispensary and she could live with them too.
And so she switched careers once again to nursing, attending nursing school from 6-9 pm every night while working in the dispensary during the day.
By then, I was able to earn a salary of 8,000 yen per month there, she said.
It was there, at the age of 27, that she met the man she would later marry. He was a contractor and with the boom in the Japanese construction industry, he had managed to do well for himself.
Fortunes change
He told me that I did not need to work anymore and that he could afford to look after both us. He also said that he did not want anything from me. So I agreed to marry him and move in with his family, unlike my other siblings, she said.
Her husband, however, had two younger siblings at home and his mother, a single parent, worked, so she found that once again she was called onto to babysit.
It was then that I realized that if you dont study, life is going to be very hard for you. It was as if I had been put into the role of a maid rather than a wife, recalled Ogawa.
Three years later, she gave birth to a son, but when their son was 12 years old, her husband was diagnosed with cancer.
For five years he struggled with the disease and at 48, he passed away.
Cancer ran in his family and within the year, his sister and younger brother too died of it.
The deaths devastated her mother-in-law and made her mentally unstable. She too then died eight years later.
The sudden death of her husband, however, resulted in his life insurance paying her a premium three times that which was originally agreed to. And his company looked after her sons education. Thus, at 56, she found that she had very little to do in life and with no one to do it with.
It is then that she saw an advertisement in the paper, asking if anyone wanted to donate their old spectacle frames to people in Sri Lanka. It was an advert by Haruo Kumagai who was working with a Sri Lankan Student Association at the Keio University. She met him and offered to become a volunteer in his venture.
Coming to Sri Lanka
The Sri Lanka Students Association had also started a scholarship programme together with the Japan Association for Sri Lanka Friendship (JASP) to help underprivileged Sri Lankan A/L students in 1994.
Former Secretary to the Ministry of Higher Education and current senior advisor at the Ministry of Social Welfare and Empowerment, Dr. Sunil Jayantha Nawarathne was a student at the University at the time and said they initially started off with giving Rs. 1,000 per month for the two-year period for 60 scholarships a year. Dr. Nawarathne, who has built a close relationship with Ogawa over the years, has been a strong influence in her work in Sri Lanka.
There are many bright students suffering from economic hardships. At the time, there was no fund; we would send money whenever we raise some to the bank accounts of students. But now, we have a steady fund, said Dr. Nawarathne.
Ogawas fund thus has helped the scholarship programme going in a more systematic manner,
In Japan, you have no such social system to assist people in need. Everyone has to work. I have little wants and my husbands insurance money has been more than sufficient. so I donated half of it to the fund, added Ogawa, who has been the key player in the programme since the death of Kumagai to cancer.
It was she who negotiated to set up a separate fund in 1999 with the assistance of the Japan Sri Lanka Technical Cooperation Association (JASTICA) and donated 10,000 Yen for it.
I had planned to spend retirement with my husband, but I cannot do that now, so I want this money to help children who can study and be prosperous, she said.
She believed that education was the only way for one to realize their dreams and her dream was to make their dreams a reality.
I want to do the little help I can to help these kids, if they in turn contribute to their society and country, I will be happy, she said.
I feel that my hometown is here, not there, said Ogawa, as she lived mostly on her own in Japan. Her family lived too far to visit frequently, but in Sri Lanka, she has found a new kind of family and home.
The difference between Japan and Sri Lanka is that in Sri Lanka, people are grateful for even the little assistance a woman like me can give whereas in Japan, they dont care, said Ogawa.
Since my childhood, people have been telling me to do this and that. I was bullied throughout, but here, I have become an asset; people appreciate my service, she said, having lived her own life no different to that of Oshins.

Title joy turns to relegation despair for Middlesex
LONDON - Middlesex suffered the humiliation of being relegated just a year after being crowned English county champions.
Middlesex collapsed in limp fashion in their final match of the season with last year's runners-up Somerset, who were also battling to avoid relegation, as they skittled out for just 113 to lose by 231 runs. Hampshire's draw with Warwickshire sealed Middlesex's fate although the state of the Taunton pitch may still hold a glimmer of hope for them.
Althought it received a rating of below average after the match -- which does not carry a points deduction -- investigations are to continue to see whether it overly favoured the hosts spinners.
There's going to be an investigation tomorrow. Phil Whitticase, another CLO, comes in. He'll conduct an investigation and he will go through my findings and speak to both umpires, both captains and the groundstaff, said ECB cricket liaison officer (CLO) Wayne Noon.
He could downgrade it, he could upgrade it, that's entirely up to him. He looks at the evidence and he makes his own call.
Middlesex's Australian captain Adam Voges conceded his team had been outplayed but was not impressed by the state of the pitch.
We came here knowing we would face a pitch that helped Somerset's spinners because every team in the world prepares wickets to aid their strengths, but there needs to be line which teams can't cross, said Voges.
Whether Somerset have crossed that line for this match is for the match referee to decide. I have certainly let him know my thoughts. What we didn't expect was rake marks at both ends that were encroaching into danger areas on what was already a worn pitch. That was a surprise. I'll admit we have been comfortably outplayed over the four days. The ECB directive is that a pitch cannot be marked poor simply for excessive spin.
Moving in the opposite direction are Worcestershire as champions of the second tier and Nottinghamshire, who completed a terrific season, having won both the limited-over competitions.

Trinity College rugby player dies at practice

A seventeen-year-old Trinity college rugby player who collapsed during a warmup run from Trinity College to the Pallakelle Stadiumon Saturday(30) died at the Kandy General Hospital yesterday (1).
Trinity College Headmaster Andrew FowlerWatt said Bhathiya (Ekanayake) was immediately taken to the nearest Chanelling Centre in Pallekelle by the Master in Charge of Rugby and one of the TCK Coaching staff.
The doctor (who saw him immediately) advised that he should transported as quickly as possible to Kandy General Hospital.
When he reached the Hospital, Bhathiya was immediately admitted to the ICU. From that moment, he received the best possible levels of medical support with a large number of doctors and nurses working extremely hard on his behalf.
However, it was ultimately to no avail; despite fighting all the way himself, Bhathiya finally lost his battle for life this afternoon. He died with his loving family at his bedside, the Headmaster said.
He added, Until the moment he collapsed, there had apparently been no suggestion whatsoever (according to both boys and staff) that Bhathiya was experiencing any sort of difficulty. Far from it, in fact  his teammates and coaches had been amazed by his performance throughout the session.
Ekanayake, studying in grade twelve, played in last seasons under eighteen matches as a prop forward.
He was training to take part in 1st XV pre-Season rugby training when he passed away.
Bhathiya Ekanayake is the son of a Trinity College staffer.

UNIDOs Dr Berkel highlights SDGs,  industry way forward in Colombo today
UNs specialized agency for industrial development working to usher Inclusive and sustainable industrialization framework will unveil its way forward on industry framework of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on October 2 afternoon for the first time.
The visiting New Delhi based UNIDO Regional Representative Dr Rene Van Berkel will be addressing the Lankan public today afternoon elaborating on background, opportunities and challenges for business from the SDGs and provide practical examples from the work of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization in South and South-East Asia on advancing inclusive and sustainable industrial development.
Dr Berkel will be addressing the public October 2 at 5:30 pm at CWE Secretariat, 9th floor, No 27, Vauxhall Street, Colombo 2. Dr Berkel also visited Sri Lanka in July and met the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishad Bathiudeen on July 25.
The 193 Member States of the United Nations universally adopted on September 25, 2015 Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Agenda is operationalized in 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 associated targets, converging into one destination: the journey to the future we want! SDGs in the areas of poverty, nutrition, sanitation, health, education and environment are principally a diversification and extension of the efforts started during 2000-2015 under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to speed up and redouble impact, particularly for the most vulnerable in society under the adagio of reaching the furthest behind first to ensure that indeed no one will be left behind.
Other SDGs are new, relative to the earlier MDGs, and aim to transform the large-scale drivers to sustainable development outcomes, including economy, jobs, industry, cities, consumption and production, peace, justice and partnerships. The 17SDGs as a package are integrated and ambitious, and hence indivisible.
It is the first time ever that industry has been explicitly included in the development agenda, specifically the achievement of inclusive and sustainable industrialization (SDG9).
This reflects the widespread recognition that industry is indispensable for achieving inclusive and sustainable economic growth. Business as usual is though not viable in light of natural resource, environment and climate constraints.
A transformation is needed to get industries that are fit for the present and for the future, by being productive and competitive, zeroing out emissions and waste, and creating value with all stakeholders, in short inclusive and sustainable industrialization. Business leadership is particularly sought to provide scalable solutions that put the last ones first in areas as diverse as affordable housing, sustainable cities and mobility, food and nutrition, and healthcare.

Unitary status stays
Constitutional Assembly Steering Committee member MP Dr. Jayampathi Wickremeratne yesterday, assured that there are no Federalism features in the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms which was submitted recently to the Constitutional Assembly.
He was briefing the media on the interim report at the Department of Government Information, to raise public awareness of the proposals included in the report and what follows the submission.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena extensively questioned on the same matter and said that he can rest assure no such federalism characteristics are incorporated into the interim report proposals.
The Constitutional Assembly(CA) will commence and continue discussions on the interim report submitted by the steering committee on October 30, 31 and November 1, 2017, Dr. Wickremeratne also said.
From the outset, Dr. Wickremeratne emphasised that the proposals in the interim report are not carved in stone. He pointed out that the report can be argued against or for, and stressed that extensive public discussions regarding the same are a must in order to raise public awareness and opinion.
Constitutions are always made by compromise, Dr. Wickremeratne added.
Speaking on the alleged federalism character traits, Dr. Wickremeratne pointed out that this interim report proposes that In Sri Lanka, sovereignty will vest with the people and shall be inalienable and indivisible.
Dr. Wickremeratne pointed out that the main characteristic of federalism is the dividedness of the sovereignty, which the above proposal negates.
He said the interim report proposes that Sri Lanka should remain an undivided and indivisible country, which is not the case in the present Constitution. In the present Constitution we have, there is no provision on saying sovereignty is indivisible, where as in the proposed one, a provision is made available. Dr. Wickremeratne said. Indivisible means that the country cannot be divided now or ever, he explained. The added feature will put worried minds at ease on the alleged Federalist features of the report, Dr. Wickremeratne said.
The interim report points out the classical definition of a unitary state has changed and proposes that the most appropriate wording to mean aekiya rajyaya/orumiththa nadu is a state which is undivided and indivisible.
Speaking on maximum power devolution proposed by the interim report, Dr. Wickremeratne said devolution of power does not mean dividing of the country. Dr. Wickremeratne pointed out that the proposal on devolution of power, will strengthen the provincial councils or such authority.
However, Dr. Wickremeratne pointed out that the proposed provision to safeguard secession of land says that No provincial council or other authority may declare any part of the territory of Sri Lanka to be a separate state or advocate or take steps towards the secession of any Province or part thereof from Sri Lanka.
Dr.Wickremeratne also spoke on much debated abolishment of Executive Presidency. He observed that numbers of political parties including UNP are in supportive of abolishing the post, whereas SLFP seem to argue otherwise.
The interim report says that There was a general consensus that the Executive Presidency as it exists today, be abolished. However, Dr. Wickremeratne said the need for a president has been considered as a result of which the report suggest that such President should be elected by Parliament for a fixed term and that the President should be conferred with powers including those in relation to Provincial Councils in specified situations.
On the election of Prime Minister, the report proposes to use either of the three methods; Direct election, Pre-nomination or Westminister System, he also said.
Dr. Wickremeratne pointed out that the dominant view of the committee made its way into the report. However he said, other proposals and view points were also included in the report and is open for discussion. Addressing the allegation that the interim report attempts to turn Sri Lanka into a secular country, Dr. Wickremeratne said, Sri Lanka already is a secular country. Drawing examples from several verdicts, Dr. Wickremeratne pointed out that according to the constitution of Sri Lanka, it is a secular state.
According to Dr. Wickremeratne, the committee received six or more proposals regarding the matter of religion, however he said, they listed the proposals down to two. These two includes what we already have in the constitution and a new provision. We could use either of them. Dr. Wickremeratne said.
The first proposed formulation is that Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while assuing to all religions the right granted by Article 10 and 14 (1) (e) of the present constitution. The second formulation is that Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while treating all religions and beliefs with honour and dignity, and without discrimination, and guaranteeing to all persons the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Dr. Wickremeratne pointed out that it is a matter of understanding the difference between equality and no discrimination when it comes to the matter of religion. This does not suggest giving all religions give the equal state of Buddhism. This is to ensure that no religion to undergo discrimination. But, we always have the option of sticking with the clause we already have. This will also be taken up at discussions, he added.
The Steering Committee was appointed on March 9, 2016 by the Constitutional Assembly established by Parliament.

Walkers Colombo Shipyard launches second vessel
Walkers Colombo Shipyard (Pvt) Ltd, a subsidiary of MTD Walkers PLC, has successfully completed the construction of its second vessel, a 10 tonne bollard pull tug Seagulf 2.
The barge designed and constructed entirely by in-house team of highly skilled naval architects and engineers under the guidance of Dr. Sarath Obeysekera, Managing Director of Walkers Colombo Shipyard (Pvt) Ltd., was launched recently at the Walkers Colombo Shipyard in Mutwal Harbour.
Built under supervision of Indian Register of Shipping which is the certifying authority for the vessels, the tug is of 16 m long and 5 m wide with draft of 1.65 m. The tug can handle a pollard pull of 10 tons and is equipped with two 400 horse power Cummins engine and a Cummins Generator.
Earlier this year, Walkers Colombo Shipyard designed and built a 1,000 tonne barge which was used by Walkers Piling (Pvt) Limited to carry out Sri Lankas first sea piling in the harbour basin for the installation of the 1,250 tonne capacity shiplift.
MTD Walkers PLC, Sri Lankas only fully integrated engineering solutions provider, expanded its presence in the Marine Engineering sector in 2015 by unveiling its plans to open a state of the art ship repair facility in Mutwal Harbour with an investment of over USD 8.5 million.
The commissioning of the Ship Lift is planned for the end of this year which will enable high growth in dollar revenues and diversify Group revenue streams. We have already commenced ship building as demonstrated by the launch of two of our own vessels, the 750 tonne barge and the 10 tonne bollard pull tug boat launched recently. We are also building a 23 metre self -propelled barge for an export order and are in advanced negotiations for more new building opportunities said Mahesh Yogarajan, Executive Director of Walkers Colombo Shipyard (Pvt) Ltd
Following up on previous statements, Mahesh Yogarajan indicated that the shipyard would soon announce a positive financing arrangement for the Shipyard.

The CID conducting investigations into the murder of former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen today sought a warrant for the arrest of former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof.Ananda Samarasekara over the alleged role in the cover up of evidence when conducting the first post mortem on Thajudeens body.
Filing a motion before Colombo Additional Magistrate Jayram Trotsky, the CID further sought Courts intervention to name former JMO Ananda Samarasekara as the third suspect in the Thajudeen murder case.
However, Additional Magistrate observed that he would make a suitable order regarding these requests after inspecting the facts pertaining to a Fundamental Rights petition filed by Ananda Samarasekara.
Prof. Samarasekara had filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an interim order preventing CID from arresting him in connection with the alleged loss of body parts of late Wasim Thajudeen.
Filing a further report in court, ASP Wickremasekara of CID Homicide Investigations Unit said that Ananda Samarasekara can be charged for concealing evidence under section 198 of the Penal Code.
'The investigations conducted so far have revealed that Prof. Samarasekara had also threatened his junior staffs when preparing the post mortem report. Investigations have also revealed former Colombo Chief JMO had acted in an irresponsible manner when he was conducting the first post mortem on Thajudeens body,' ASP Wickremasekara said.
Meanwhile, the Additional Magistrate directed the CID that information pertaining to the FR petition and anticipatory bail application filed by Prof. Ananda Samarasekara be submitted in court tomorrow.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General informed Court there is a possibility of arresting former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof.Ananda Samarasekara over the alleged loss of body parts of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen.
Former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera had been named as first and second suspects of this case. They were arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder and conspiring to commit the murder.
They are currently out on bail.

When Im writing fiction, I cannot read it
As a child, books were your refuge. The entirety of book-world was your tribe. The March family taught you morals; Anne of Green Gables, especially if you were like me, an unruly kid with reddish braids, gave you hope. Maybe Brian Robeson in Hatchet made you believe you could survive anything. The Lord of the Flies let you know that you wouldnt.
As you grew older, you discovered new books and new ways to learn from them, but that profound connection you feel with them never left you.
What, though, if the joy did
For life-long bookworms, as many novelists are, becoming a published author is a dream come true. Or perhaps more accurately, a long-awaited arrival. You enter the heart of the tribe.
Being a novelist is hard work. You are at your desk for often long, often irregular hours. Or for short hours that you wish could be longer. Frequently you struggle through one or the other without knowing whether a paycheck awaits you at the end. When your novel is published, you have to switch to a whole new skill set to assist with marketing and publicity. You may also have to face a new set of trolls.
At the same time, making up stories for a living is crazy wonderful. Having a legitimate excuse to obsess over language is utter relief. My books, although not autobiographical, still carry a piece of my heart; in becoming a published novelist, I feel as though Ive in a way become the very thing I spent my life loving.
But what if becoming a published novelist was to rob the pleasure that inspired it What if it was to hamper the act or, worse still, joy of reading
My second novel, Shining Sea, came out in paperback last month. In the year between the hardcover release and the paperback, I was involved in promoting the novel, wrote a number of short and long-form nonfiction articles and op-eds, wrote some politically oriented speeches, and began researching and making notes for a new novel. I also read like a coyote loose among sheep. I devoured new releases, explored and fell in love with a whole new (for me) genre, and consumed huge chunks out of my to-be-read pile. I re-read every book I own by Willa Cather, which is pretty much every book by Willa Cather. I consumed any book of fiction or creative nonfiction related to Uganda that I could get my hands on. I strode into bookstores and strolled back out with books recommended by the bookseller. I always am startled when, at the end of the year, I tally my book-buying costs. This year I may need to down a glass of wine first. In October, after a final loop through California, all of my scheduled book touring for Shining Sea will be done. As much as I enjoy visiting bookstores and meeting readers, I look forward to settling down to the nitty-gritty of my new novel, closing my office door to the world, and turning the notes and random pages and research Ive amassed over the past year into a carefully crafted whole.
Does this mean my greedy fiction-reading streak will have to end
When Ronlyn Domingue, author of The Mercy of Thin Air and The Keeper of Tales trilogy, is working on a new book, she will read ARCs if asked for blurbs and do critiques. But she will rarely read for pleasure.* Kelly Simmons, author of One More Day and the forthcoming Fourth of July, says, [W]hen Im writing I cant tolerate what others might call a guilty pleasure. Im worried it might seep in!
I also shy away from reading other peoples fiction when Im in the thick of writing a new novel. I have to read daily, especially before I go to sleep at night. The idea of not doing so is impossible; I might as well go on a fastsomething you would never catch me doing. But while Im developing the voice of a book, I dont want to hear someone elses fiction cadences.
For a period of time in the course of working on a new fiction manuscript, novelsapart from ARCs that have been sent to me for blurbs and fiction by friends to critiquedisappear from my bedside table to be replaced by nonfiction titles, newspapers, and magazines. While writing Shining Sea, the table was also occupied variously with books by or about a WWII Japanese prison camp survivor, a Pacific Ocean surfer, John McPhees The Crofter and The Laird: Life on an Hebridean Island, Homers The Odyssey, and other books whose cadences I did want to catch (or at least those of a character in them). Books, in other words, I might appreciate as a reader but was reading as a writer. The irony! Doing the job I love, although intimately connected to the pastime I love, clearly also interferes with it.
Some novelists do read other peoples fiction while they write. I always read, even when I am in the thick of my own work, Marcy Dermansky, author most recently of The Red Car says, because I need to be reading. It would be too bleak not to be reading; it takes a long time to write a novel.
Yes! Elizabeth Silver, author of the novel The Execution of Noa P. Singleton (as well as a recent memoir), replies when I ask whether she continues to read fiction. Constantly! Pamela Erens, author most recently of Eleven Hours, says. Like Domingue, other novelists dont. Generally not, Ramsey Hootman, author of Surviving Cyril, says, Although Ive learned in the past five or ten years that this doesnt apply to nonfiction. Allie Larkin, author of Stay and Why Cant I Be You, concurs: I have a hard time reading novels at some stage of writing my own. I stick to non-fiction then.
Still other authors do continue to read fiction, but not in their own genres. Yes, sometimes I cant help myself, Emily Holleman, author of The Fall of Egypt series says. But I avoid reading things that are at all similar in genre/tone. No historical fiction when writing historical fiction. Jasmine Guillory, author of forthcoming The Wedding Date, says, more specifically, I read every day and have since I first learned to read. I tend not to read books that are in the same genre/style of mine while Im first drafting, though. - Lit Hub
