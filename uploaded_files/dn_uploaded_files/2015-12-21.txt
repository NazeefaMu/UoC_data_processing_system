British PM wants women training for front line in 2016
UK: British Prime Minister David Cameron told The Sunday Telegraph newspaper he wanted to see female British soldiers training to fight on the front line in 2016.
Cameron has asked the Ministry of Defence to be ready to post women in ground close-combat roles by the end of next year, after Washington announced this month its military will open all positions -- including frontline combat roles -- to women.
The Defence Secretary (Michael Fallon) and I are united in wanting to see all roles in our armed forces opened up to women in 2016, Cameron said. Weve already lifted a number of barriers in our armed forces with the introduction of female submariners and women reaching the highest ranks in all services.
We should finish the job next year and open up ground combat roles to women.
Female troops make up around 10 percent of Britains armed forces.
Women are currently banned from ground combat units where the primary role is to close with and kill the enemy.
A review found no compelling evidence to prove women impair effectiveness in close combat situations, Fallon said.

Celebrity bird rescued after Taiwan subway adventure
TAIWAN: A rare crane that has become a celebrity in Taiwan after getting lost on its journey from Siberia last year had to be rescued after a new misguided foray to a subway station.
The beautiful white bird had made wetlands in northern Taiwan its home for almost a year since last December, after taking a wrong turn on a migratory route from Siberia to China.
Separated from its flock, locals have welcomed the young Siberian crane -- the farmer who owns the wetlands where the bird now lives has stopped using pesticides to ensure it can eat untainted food.
And it even has a security guard during daylight hours to protect it from stray dogs.
But on Thursday night, wanderlust gripped the crane once more -- taking it at least 30 kilometres (19 miles) away to Songshan railway station in the north of the capital Taipei.
Passers-by and commuters were stunned when the tall, elegant bird landed outside the station and stayed there, seemingly unafraid of the crowds.
It was pictured standing on the street as two officials looked on.
After an emergency call to animal rescuers, it is now in a temporary shelter.
It is not immediately clear why the crane left the sanctuary after staying there a whole year, surviving three typhoons, said conservationist Liao Jen-hui, who has been called in to deal with the birds protection.
Liao said the crane had exhibited an unusually sociable streak after landing at the busy interchange station.
Such birds are sensitive to people and would normally be watched from at least 200 metres away, she told AFP.
Experts from Taipei Zoo are checking the birds health before the next step is decided.
The year-old male bird has become a tourist attraction, with fans travelling to the northern district of Jinshan to catch a glimpse, before it flew to Taipei.
The Siberian crane population has declined sharply to around 4,000 over the past century, Liao said, owing to hunting along their migration routes and habitat destruction.

China landslide leaves 91 missing, sparks gas explosion
A landslide that swept through an industrial park in southern China has buried more than 30 buildings in a sea of mud, leaving 91 people missing and triggering a gas explosion, Chinese media said Monday.

Witnesses described a mass of red earth and mud racing towards the park in the city of Shenzhen in "huge waves" before burying or crushing homes and factories, twisting some of them into grotesque shapes, according to the official Xinhua news agency.

The landslide was caused by the improper storage of waste soil from construction sites, according to the official newspaper of the Ministry of Land and Resources.

The soil was allegedly illegally stored in piles 100 metres (330 feet) high at an old quarry site and turned to mud during heavy rain Sunday morning, the state-run Global Times reported.

There were 91 people missing as of 9:00 am (0100 GMT) Monday, according to officials from the city's emergency office cited by the Shenzhen Evening News newspaper.

More than 1,500 emergency workers were involved in the rescue, and 104 fire engines were dispatched, Xinhua said.

Map locating Shenzhen, China where dozens are missing Sunday after a landslide buried 22 buildings. 
It said debris covered more than 10 hectares (25 acres).

Industrial accidents are common in China, with safety regulations often overlooked due to corruption. An explosion in August in the port city of Tianjin that killed nearly 200 was blamed on improperly stored chemicals.

In the Shenzhen case, about 900 people were moved out of harm's way before the landslide struck late in the morning in the city, which borders Hong Kong. Four people have been rescued, three of whom had minor injuries.

- 'Buried in mud' -

"I saw red earth and mud running towards the company building," one local worker was quoted by Xinhua as saying.

A woman surnamed Hu told the Shenzhen Evening News Sunday that she saw her father buried by earth in his own truck.

"It's been hours after he was buried, and we are quite worried," she said.

Rescue operations were slowed by numerous obstacles, including continued rain, low visibility overnight, and mud, Ao Zhuoqian, a member of the Shenzhen fire brigade involved in on-site rescue, told Xinhua.

Photos showed victims wrapped in green blankets sleeping on floor pads and eating instant noodles.

He Weiming, a migrant worker at a temporary shelter, said he had lost contact with 16 different friends and family members, including his parents, wife and two children, and had made dozens of phone calls to try to find them, all of which went unanswered.

"When my brother and I drove out in the morning to go collect garbage, our home was still fine, but when we came back... the house had been buried in mud - you couldnt even see the roof of our four-metre-high sheet-metal house," he told an online news site run by Internet giant Tencent, while crying and flipping through photos of his children on his cellphone.

"There are many other homes around mine - I don't know if others escaped."

The slide ruptured a natural gas pipeline and triggered an explosion heard about four kilometres (2.5 miles) away, Xinhua said.

Nearby gas stations have stopped supplying the pipeline and no gas leaks have been found, the Global Times cited the local fire department as saying.

A landslide last month that engulfed 27 homes in rural Zhejiang province killed 38 people.

Finnish prisoners given rights to receive Emails behind bars
FINLAND: Inmates behind bars have the right to receive emails and will later be given access to limited use of the internet in Finland, the Finnish Criminal Sanctions Agency announced on Thursday.
The changes are based on an amendment of the Finnish Prison Act that took effect in May 2015. The amendment offered the prisoners better opportunities of communicating with friends and family members, Xinhua reported.
Senior specialist Kati Sunimento said that Finland could be the first country in Europe to make digital communication available in prisons. "The progress of the Finnish launch is being watched with interest in other European countries," Sunimento said.
Initially, the prisoners can only receive emails, but from the end of next year they are likely to be able to respond as well, the agency said. They will not be given access to social media such as Facebook though.
The reform is also expected to provide more educational opportunities. For example, the Finnish Matriculation Examination can be taken online later.
The Criminal Sanctions Agency underlined in its press release that being able to act in the digital environment is a required civic ability these days.
The reform concerns the so-called closed prisons only. In Finland, about one third of the prisons are open institutions permitting their inmates to leave premises during the day and presuming them to come back. Inmates of open prisoners have been able to use the internet outside the prison.
No attachments or pictures will be allowed in the emails that go to prisoners. Special collective addresses have been established for sending emails to inmates of Finnish prisons.
The agency said lawyers must decide themselves whether they want to use emails for their communication with the prisoners. - IANS

Islamic State has revolutionised terror - FBI

US: The director of the FBI, James Comey, said that Islamic State (IS) had revolutionised terrorism and that the world faces a much more serious threat today than ever before.
Comey said the groups decentralised structure and use of social media to spread propaganda and incite attacks made it particularly difficult to combat. Your parents al-Qaeda was a very different model than the threat we face today, he said.
The FBI, he said, had hundreds of investigations in all 50 US states as part of an attempt to stop those inspired by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) also known as Islamic State (IS) from carrying out attacks. He said the ability of Isil conspirators to use encrypted communications, and the constant threat of small-scale attacks worldwide, posed new challenges to US law enforcement.
Meanwhile, secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson was in Washington unveiling a new system to alert the public to terrorist threats.
Johnson said the National Threat Advisory System would be revised, so that the public would be made aware of general developments or trends regarding threats of terrorism in the form of bulletins posted to the homeland security website.
The attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, have reignited the debate in the US about how best to combat terrorism. Polls show that terrorism is now the primary concern for the American public, overtaking the state of the economy and government gridlock.
In Tuesdays Republican Presidential debate, candidates berated the Obama administration for its alleged failure to keep the American people safe. One recurring concern was that Tashfeen Malik, the female San Bernardino attacker, had been allowed into the US despite reportedly having posted in support of Isil on Facebook.
For heavens sake, every parent in America is checking social media and every employer is as well, but our government cant do it, said Carly Fiorina, a Republican candidate.
In his remarks yesterday, Johnson said the Department of Homeland Security was consulting social media as part of the vetting process for immigrants, and had been since early this year.
Under my leadership as secretary, we in fact began to consult social
media in connection with conferring various immigration benefits and we will be doing more of this, he said. Any reports or partial reports to the contrary are simply false.
Comey said the FBI had no evidence linking Malik and Syed Farook, her husband and co-conspirator, to a terrorist cell. US officials say it appears the couple, who slaughtered 14 people at a party, were inspired by - but not directly affiliated with - Isil.
Speaking alongside Comey, New Yorks Police Commissioner Bill Bratton reiterated that the threats made on Tuesday against schools in Los Angeles and New York had been a hoax.
Los Angeles elected to close all 1,000 of its schools on Tuesday after receiving a threat overnight that an army would attack schools with explosive devices and automatic weapons.

Miss Universe gaffe stirs online storm
Shock and disbelief have erupted online after the wrong Miss Universe winner was crowned.Miss Colombia Ariadna Gutierrez was announced winner of the 2015 beauty pageant before organisers revealed she was actually the first runner-up.
Miss Philippines Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach was later declared the winner.

#MissUniverse2015 also became Twitter's biggest trend of the night as thousands of social media users began to express disbelief using jokes and memes.

'Miss Information'

"Talk about awkward," described one Twitter user who "couldn't help" but find the gaffe "hilarious".
Another user, Mark Critch from Canada, said: "And the winner is - Miss Information."
Facebook users also expressed their opinions on a post shared on the pageant's official page.

It was shared close to 40,000 times and received more than 11,000 comments from viewers across the world. "That was poorly handled. Both of these gorgeous ladies deserve an apology because that was embarrassing for both of them. I literally felt both of their pain," read a top comment by Lemmy Cliff.

"That was the most annoying Miss Universe contest ever," said another commenter Andres Felipe Arbelaez. "The host was horrible and Miss Colombia should have won." Pageant fans from the Philippines also began to express anger at the incident. "Our Miss Philippines didn't get her shining moment," said a fan on Facebook. "It feels like she and our country were robbed of the winning moment, shame!"

At the end of the night, Ms Gutierrez was named first runner-up followed by Olivia Jordan from the United States.
Host Steve Harvey responded, saying it was "his mistake" and he would take responsibility for not reading the winning card correctly.
"I'd like to apologize wholeheartedly to Miss Colombia & Miss Philippines for my huge mistake. I feel terrible," he said in a tweet that was re-tweeted more than 51,000 times. "I don't want to take away from this amazing night and pageant. As well as the wonderful contestants - they were all amazing."

While some Twitter users remained upset over the mistake, others began to tweet out messages of support.
"Don't feel terrible. Everyone makes mistakes," said Pedro Da Cunha.
"To err is human... to forgive is divine," said another user in reply to Mr Harvey's apology.
In an incident apparently unconnected to the competition, at least one person was killed and dozens injured after a car ploughed into a crowd next to the Miss Universe venue. (BBC)

Mustapha challenges UPFA MPs

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha presented a challenge to coffers of political parties in the SLFP-led United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA), to contest the forthcoming Local Government election on their own and show that they could win a single local body.
"I challenge those political coffers in the UPPA who have been vocalizing their plans of an invention of making a new political force in the country, to do so by leaving their alliance with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and show their political strength if they command any strength as such, by winning one local body," said Minister Mustapha.
He said in any case, if the the SLFP was split in two, the advantage goes to the United National Party.
He asked if these UPFA members wanted a UNP victory at the election.
"Former Presidents Chandrika Bandaranaika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa, they all emerged from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and they love this party," he said.
"They will never let the SLFP down. They stand to protect it," he added.

Norway is the best country to live in the world
NORWAY: It is not easy to stay on top for 12 long years, especially when it comes to being the best nation in the world to live in.
However, Norway has lived up to its reputation and has been adjudged the best country in the world to live in - for the 12th consecutive year.
The list of 188 countries has been released as part of the annual UN Human Development Report. It takes into account the Human Development Index, which is a measure of basic human developments.
On the opposite end of the scale, Niger, Central African Republic and Eritrea are three of the worse places to live.
The rankings were based on the Human Development Index announced by the United Nations Development Programme this week. The USA came in at number eight while the UK was further down at joint 14th position with Sweden.
Surprises came further down the list when Hong Kong ranked 12 but China ranked just 90, joint with Fiji and Mongolia. Vanuatu, a place that once came top on a happy planet index came in at just 134 with Syria.
Qataris were on average the wealthiest, with a GNI per capita of $123,124 (82,022) - but this was capped at $75,000 (49,963) for the calculation of the HDI.
Central African Republicans were the poorest, with a GNI per capita of just $581 (387).
This value was based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), or the amount of goods you could buy with your dollar.
The people of Burkina Faso were the least educated, with a mean schooling of just 1.4 years, while Germany had a mean schooling of 13.1 years.
If you want to live a long life, its best to head to Hong Kong where life expectancy is 84 years. In contrast, those living in Swaziland only had a life expectancy of 49 years.
Seven countries and territories were not ranked, including North Korea, Marshall Islands and Monaco.
The HDI also doesnt take into account of things like human rights, pollution or the hours of work.

Committee appointed to present recommendations on CC: PM
The government has appointed a committee to present recommendations on the Constitutional Council, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament on Saturday.
He added that the Constitutional Council is not something above Parliament and the same will be implemented by Parliament.
The Premier made these observations joining the Committee Stage debate of the Budget proposal.
"We have appointed a committee to present recommendations on the Constitutional Council," the Premier said. "The Constitutional Council is implemented by Parliament. It is not something above Parliament."
At this stage, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said there were provisions in the Standing Orders to appoint Working Committees.
"We should appoint a select committee for the formulation of the constitution," Dissanayake said. "There are no provisions to convert the entire Parliament into a constitutional assembly". Premier Wickremesinghe said that they could meet under his leadership.
He added that according to the provisions of the Constitution, Parliament could pass a motion to stay out of Standing Orders. "We are not going against legal provisions. We could meet and make decisions which could then be forwarded to the sub-committee on the Constitutional Council," the Premier said.
"Thereafter we could forward it to the Cabinet of Ministers and then to Parliament." Dissanayake said decisions with regard to Parliament affairs could be made at the Party Leaders' meeting. "We should work in a manner complementary with the Standing Orders," Dissanayake said.
"The Leader of the House informed us that the Prime Minister had said that the proposed workshop for new MPs was not necessary."
Premier Wickremesinghe said that a date could be decided and then the workshop conducted.
He added that the date could be someday even next year. At this stage, opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena said the amendments to the Constitution should be made in accordance with the decisions made at the party leaders' meeting.
He added that the entire Parliament could be turned into a working committee and its proposals could be forwarded to Parliament later for approval."President Maithripala Sirisena has agreed to prune down executive powers from the presidency," Premier Wickremesinghe said. "We could do so with the consent of people. We are not going to do so in one day as the 18th amendment to the Constitution had been passed."

Only Council appointed: PM
Responding to a question by UPFA MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena regarding the establishment of the National Executive Council, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that a national executive council was not established and only a council was appointed to take decisions with regard to the implementation of the 100 days programme.
"Civil Society Organisations which worked together for the victory of President Maithripala Sirisena formed a council for the implementation of the 100 day programme and that committee was named as the National Executive Council. It was a volunteer committee and Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera was also a member of that council," the Prime Minister said.
He said there was freedom to give any name to an organisation.
Apart from the UNP working committee, the UNP also has a National Executive Council. But all these councils remain outside Parliament, the Prime Minister said.
"There is an opposition that has been accepted by the Speaker and at the same time a group of MPs claims that they are representing the joint opposition. That could happen because they have freedom to name it as a joint opposition," he added.
When Abeywardena claimed that the National Executive Council as a murderers' organisation, the Prime Minister questioned whether he accept that his party leader, President Sirisena who is the chairman of the murderers' organisation as a murderer.
"We are very well aware about who are the real murderers. We should pay our gratitude to the President for the effort taken by him to put an end to the era of murderers," the Prime Minister said.

He also added that the project will create an opportunity to develop the Colombo city without affecting the people living in the city.
It will also provide a solution for the scarcity of a large land area for systematic development within the Colombo city, the minister said.

Proposed trade agreement between India and Sri Lanka: Anura wants debate in House
Since there is a serious debate in the country about the proposed trade agreement between India and Sri Lanka, it should be submitted to Parliament for debate and approval before it is implemented, DNA MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in Parliament on Saturday.
There would be a severe economic fallout for the country if this agreement was signed, the MP said.
He said it would result in the breakdown of the local industry while unemployment would also soar due to tax concessions provided for the services sector through this.
Dissanayake was joining the committee stage debate of Budget 2016 under the financial heads of the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry, Development Strategies and International Trade Ministry and the Finance Ministry. If doctors come from India what will happen to the quality of the health service. The release of 108 luxury jeeps from the Customs is a fraud. Defending this act is also a fraud, he said.
"We do not accept the government's economic policies which will only lead to the creation of more racketeers. Some concessions should be provided to those who opened letters of credit to import vehicles prior to the budget," he said.

Amendments introduced respecting public view: Wijeyadasa
Condemning the criticisms by various groups claiming that the amendments brought to the budget 2016, reflects the incompetency of the government, Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe told Parliament on Saturday that the government brought several amendments to budget 2016 by respecting public view and the democracy.
He also said that the way of holding budget debates in the Sri Lankan Parliament is an outdated tradition and emphasised the necessity of holding pre-budgetary debates to get public opinions prior to the preparation of budget proposals.
"I proposed the previous regime several times to establish an independent budgetary office and a data bank within Parliament premises, enabling Members of Parliament as well as the public to get any data in any field. The then government was not able to do that," the minister said.
"During the previous regimes what we experienced was the Finance Minister presenting the budget proposals to Parliament, then holding debates while the budgets were finally passed without any changes.
But this normal process had changed this time and various amendments were brought to the Budget 2016, by considering the proposals and criticisms of people's representatives," he said.
"Some argued whether Budget 2016 was the Prime Minister's, the President's or the Finance Minister's budget. But I must say that this is a people's budget and not anybody else's budget," he added.

Wigneswaran forms new organisation: First step towards splitting TNA

Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran has formed a new "non-political" organisation which observers see as the first step towards splitting the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) which he represents in the Northern Provincial Council (NPC).
The outfit, christened Tamil Makkal Peravai or Tamil Peoples' Assembly (TPA), was formed after a four-hour meeting at the Jaffna Public Library on Saturday. Estimates of the number of people who attended vary from 15 to 30. But the significant thing is that only one TNA member of the NPC and not a single TNA MP attended. It was a closed door meeting into which the media was not allowed. After the meeting, Wigneswaran refused to brief the media, but individual attendees spoke to the press..
Prominent among those who attended were Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, leader of the pro-LTTE Tamil National Peoples' Front (TNPF) and Suresh Premachandran of the Eelam Peoples' Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF), who is opposed to the TNA's leaders.
To give it a non-political colour, the religious leader Srila Sri Somasundara Desigar Paramacharya of the Nallai Adeenam was included along with some civil society activists. Although the TPA portrayed itself as a non-political, civil society organisation meant to work for the rights of the Tamils, Somasundara Paramacharys said that it was formed because existing political parties had failed to deliver.
Chief Minister Wigneswaran has been at odds with the TNA's leaders since the beginning of this year. Just prior to the August 17 Parliamentary elections, he declared that he would be "neutral" but he appealed to the people to vote for candidates with certain attributes which clearly showed that he was backing the radical TNPF.
The TNA leadership threatened to oust him for anti-party activities, but Wigneswaran claimed that he was a representative of the people and not the TNA. While he believes that the Sirisena government has done precious little for the Tamils, his opponents say that he himself has done little or nothing for the Tamils, except issuing statements.
While the TNA wants to engage the government, Wigneswaran prefers the path of confrontation. TNA leaders are concerned about Wigneswaran's moves, but they also point out that his men drew a blank in the parliamentary elections.
