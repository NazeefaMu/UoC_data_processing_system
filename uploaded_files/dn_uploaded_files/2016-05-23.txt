Kaerakena Keliya on May 31
The Mind Adventures theatre company in collaboration with the Janakaraliya Cultural Foundation presents Kaerakena Keliya on May 31 at 7pm at the Western Province Aesthetic Resort (NADA) on Stanley Wijesundara Mawatha, Colombo 7.
Tracy Holsinger
The show is based on The Travelling Circus adapted and devised from The Boy Who Speaks in Numbers by Mike Masilamani, which was first performed by Mind Adventures in 2009. The new production is directed by Artistic Director of Mind Adventures, Tracy Holsinger, and will be performed in Sinhala and Tamil.
The original production focused on the IDP camps and the thousands who were detained in them for so long. Seven years on, the focus of this production is on raising awareness about missing persons and promoting communal tolerance. The plays content is still controversial but at the very heart of it, is a story that is as heartwarming as it is sorrowful and poignant. I am very interested in transitional justice and memorialization, and in a post-war context, it is vital that theatre creates space for new narratives and dialogue and challenges people to think about reconciliation by telling stories that deal justly with victims and victors alike; this is how we begin to move forward, says Tracy. Ryan Holsinger translated the English script of The Boy Who Speaks In Numbers into Sinhala. All the songs and melodies were rewritten. Now that the Sinhala script is complete, Janakaraliyas Rasaiah Loganandan will translate it into Tamil. The Sinhala production will be staged at the Western Province Aesthetic Resort. The Tamil show will be staged in Janakaraliyas mobile theatre in Jaffna. Both versions of the show will tour the country. The collaboration between the two theatre companies will extend beyond this production and they have designed a series of workshops around the themes in the play that they hope to conduct in schools across the country.
Janakaraliyas main acting troupe  Sumudu Mallawaarachchi, Rasaiah Loganandan, Ronika Chamalee, Selvaraj Leelawathy, Nishantha Kularatne, Thiyagaraja Sivanesan, Ajanthan Shanthakumar, Devran Sri Livera, Arosha Tharanganie and Inoka Lankapura, star in Kaerakena Keliya.
Janakaraliya is a mobile cultural organisation that uses a collapsible theatre and travels through districts with its theatre group. The drama group consists of Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim youth recruited from various parts of the country, all of whom have been trained under a single roof by veteran dramatists.

Spieth stays second as Koepka grabs Byron Nelson lead
WASHINGTON, SATURDAY: Second-ranked Jordan Spieth, trying to rebound from two disappointing efforts, remained second after Saturday's third round of the PGA Byron Nelson Championship, two strokes back of leader Brooks Koepka.
Reigning US Open Spieth fired a three-under-par 67 in his hometown tournament, taking a bogey at 18 while US compatriot Koepka rescued a closing par with a 10-foot putt to shoot 65 and seize the 54-hole lead on 16-under 194.
It's nice to go into the final round with a two-shot lead, Koepka said. I hit the ball terrible. It wasn't anything to brag about at all. I felt like throughout the whole round, all 18 holes. It wasn't very good but I'm putting it so well.
Spain's Sergio Garcia and Americans Matt Kuchar and Bud Cauley shared third on 197.
Spieth is trying to pull off a comeback victory after missing the cut in last week's Players Championship and suffering a last-day meltdown at the Masters, where a back-nine fade cost him a second consecutive green jacket.
I was in some really tough spots and was a very stressful round of golf to play because I just don't have confidence over the ball right now, Spieth said. It's very frustrating and (I'm) actually putting incredible to still be in this tournament.
Spieth sank a 20-foot birdie putt at the par-3 17th to reach 15-under as the hometown crowd that greeted him with a standing ovation roared again with delight.
That's a moment that I'll never forget, Spieth said. To be honest, even though it's Saturday, may or may not have any impact on this tournament, that was the coolest roar I've ever heard. Fantastic walking up to that green.
But at 18, Spieth was in the trees right of the fairway off the tee and blasted out through a gap to just short of the green while Koepka went over the green on his approach.
Spieth pitched to nine feet while Koepka's pitch landed 10 feet shy of the cup. But Koepka sank his par putt to secure the lead and Spieth missed, falling two shots adrift.
It's a positive that I'm scoring well, Spieth said. It's very difficult for me to stand up here and not be positive given I'm at 14-under and contending, but if you guys knew the kind of stress I felt over the golf ball right now trying to put my swing in the right position, it is a challenge.
- Spieth, Koepka hang tough - SUB HEAD
Koepka won his only US PGA title last year at Phoenix, but he also took the Turkish Airlines Open on his way to being named 2014 European Tour Rookie of the Year.
The 26-year-old American had top-10 efforts at last year's British Open and PGA Championship and his best major showing with a share of fourth at the 2014 US Open.
Spieth, who defends his US Open crown next month at Oakmont, sank four-foot birdie putts at the fourth and par-5 seventh, closed the front nine with a birdie and hit a three-foot birdie putt at 11 to reach 15-under.
At 14, Spieth salvaged a bogey after hitting his tee shot into the water, reaching the green in four and making a 22-foot putt to surrender only one stroke.
We both kind of hung in there, battled it out and we made some good, good key 10-footers, Koepka said. That's what you've got to do out here if you're not hitting it well.
Koepka opened his roller coaster round with a bogey, birdied the third and par-3 fifth but needed two shots to escape rough and took a bogey at six.
After responding with a seven-foot birdie putt at the seventh and a 10-footer for birdie at the eighth, Koepka dropped his approach inches from the cup at 11 to set up a tap-in birdie and took the lead with a 20-foot birdie putt at the 14th.
Koepka also pitched to two feet and tapped in for birdie at the par-5 16th.

Charlo downs Jackson to make history
LOS ANGELES, SUNDAY: Jermell Charlo made boxing history on Saturday after scoring an eighth-round knockout of John Jackson in Las Vegas to claim the vacant World Boxing Council super-welterweight title.
Charlo joins twin brother Jermall Charlo as a reigning world champion in the 154-pound (69.8kg) category -- the first time twin siblings have owned world titles in the same weight division. The 26-year-old Jermell Charlo was trailing on all three judges scorecards after the first seven rounds against the skillful Jackson, but unleashed a brutal series of punches to score a knockout in the eighth round.
Charlo, who had caught Jackson flush on the chin with a left hook in the fifth round, connected with another stinging blow to his opponent's head early in the eighth round.
A stunned Jackson appeared dazed by the shot, and turned away from Charlo, who moved in for the kill, sending his opponent crashing into the ropes with a two powerful left hooks to the head.
Referee Tony Weeks halted the fight to prevent Jackson suffering further punishment.
It's history, we did it, a delighted Charlo said.
I'm waiting on my brother next, added Charlo, who improved to 28-0 with 13 knockouts. Jermall Charlo, 23-0 with 18 knockouts, is to fight on the same card later Saturday. Charlo defends his defends his International Boxing Federation crown against former champion Austin Trout.

Fairway Holdings supports Sri Lankan endeavour to conquer Everest
Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala and Johann Peries, the two intrepid mountaineers from Sri Lanka, are approaching the Death Zone  literally. The Death Zone is mountaineering shorthand for altitudes above 28,000 feet where the human body uses more oxygen than it can extract from the air putting huge stresses on the minds and bodies of climbers and causing extreme fatigue.
As the first Sri Lankans attempting the 29,000 feet Everest summit the odds against them are formidable. The rapid onset of extreme weather such as storms and blizzards mean that less than 30% of climbers taking on Everest have reached the summit despite having supplemental oxygen tanks.
Even in the best of weather conditions the Khumba Ice Falls at a pedestrian 19,000 feet is one of the most dramatic and dangerous parts of the trek.
The continuous movement of the Khumba glacier creates a maze of shifting ice which opens treacherous crevasses from below the ice floor or without warning dislodges tons of ice avalanches from high up the slope.
The crevasses which are sometimes as deep as 10 stories are crossed using aluminium ladders. Both have safely ascended the Khumba Ice Falls to reach Camp II and completed their acclimatizing rotations between the based camps.
They now have a nail biting wait for the best weather window to make the grueling final dash from base camp IV up to the summit and back  and make history as the first Sri Lankans to reach the Everest summit.
As a special event to support Jayanthi and Yohan a screening of the film Everest took place at the National Film Corporation recently.
This film, based on a true story, brings to life the extreme and treacherous conditions that prevail around this icy, windswept mountain peak that has been unattainable for all except the extraordinary few. All the people who took part in this expedition died except for a loner who lived to tell the tale.
It is a tale of intense courage, endurance and the will to live as man pits himself against the most grueling conditions on the planet.
The screening was organised by Fairway Holdings, the Summit Sponsors of the Sri Lankan Everest Expedition, to support and celebrate Jayanthis and Yohans spirit of adventure and endeavour.
Fairway Holdings is committed to helping extraordinary Sri Lankans pursue their extraordinary dreams in various arenas of sport, arts and culture.
The Everest Expedition Team wish to thank their sponsors: Summit Sponsor - Fairway Holdings; Airline Partner - Sri Lankan Airlines; Base Camp Sponsors - Seylan Bank, Sri Lanka Mobiltel Telecom, and Janashakthi Insurance; and Gear Sponsors - SEALs, Petzl and Victorinox.

Trinitys success this year derives from their all-round strength
Trinity College, Kandy led by spin-wizard Raveen Sayer doing extremely well in all formats of the game completed one of their best seasons in school cricket this year. They finished unbeaten in the league round of U19 D1 Tournament recording nine outright victories, the most by a team in U19 D1 and two first-innings wins whilst their tournament opener with Maliyadeva ended in no-result.
They not only topped their Group with 149.5 points, but also became the highest point-getter amongst the 36 schools competed at the league stage. Trinity, hard to beat in recent years came out top this season, losing only to St.Peters in quarter finals of the knock-round round. Trinity at the league stage handed St.Aloysius, DS Senanayake and St.Servatius three-innings thrashings whilst recording outright-wins over St.Anthonys-Wattala, De Mazenod, Bandaranayaka, Dharmapala, Dharmaraja and Ananda.
Even more striking was Trinitys dominance in the second leg of the tournament, The U19 all-island limited-over tournament that immediately followed the two-day League round. They advanced to the finals beating St. Sylvesters in the preliminary round, Lumbini in pre-quarters, St.Peters in quarters and Nalanda in semies before they lost the title to St.Sebastians in the finals.
Even in the shortest format of the tournament, U19 T20 Tournament (3rd leg), Trinity did well to reach semifinals which they could not make it to the finals as St.Aloysius, a team succumbed to an innings defeat at their hands during the two-day league tourney made a surprise entry into the finals beating Trinity in one of the semifinals. On their way to the semifinals of this T20 tourney, Trinity beat St.Josephs and St.Sebastians in pre-quarter finals and quarter finals respectively.
It was no wonder they were a formidable all-round force in recent years as far as the school cricket was concerned as their all-round strength meant their strategy almost always paid-off. Whenever they failed in one department, the other department came to their rescue and this collective effort immensely helped them convert probable defeats into ultimate victories. Several outstanding batsmen moved on after several years service to strengthen their batting department. Dilan Jayalath maintaining an average of 50-plus topped schools batting list with 949 runs including a century and 8 fifties whilst Nushan Werasinghe scored 601 runs with two centuries.
Shanmuganathan Shanogeeth who was making headlines as a true-to-type emerging batter also contributed with over five hundred runs to occupy the third spot in Trinitys batting list.
Trinitys bowling was heavily dependent upon skipper Raveen Sayer and leggie, Duvindu Tillakaratne who both were instrumental in Trinitys remarkable success this year. Sayer finished with 77 wickets to be schools highest wicket-taker with 8 five-wicket hauls and a 10-wicket haul whilst Duvindu came second with 62 wickets.

Fiji wins sevens title as code-hopper Hayne makes debut
LONDON, SATURDAY: Fiji retained their World Sevens Series title at Twickenham on Saturday as Jarryd Hayne made his debut for the pacific islanders in a move that could yet see the multi-sport star go to this year's Olympics.
Last week, Hayne last abandoned playing NFL with the San Francisco 49ers to pursue a spot on Fiji's sevens squad for this year's Rio Games where the short-form game will be making its Olympic bow.
The 28-year-old's run out for Fiji at Twickenham was his debut in rugby union.
He previously starred in rugby league for Parramatta Eels in the Australian NRL, during which time he won 12 caps for the Kangaroos and four for Fiji, his father's homeland. Hayne came on for the final four minutes of Fiji's surprise 31-10 defeat by tournament hosts England on Saturday. Nick Cummins, who is also pursuing his Olympic dream with the Australia sevens team after winning 15 Wallaby caps, said: Old Hayney's not a bad rooster, is he!
He's a special athlete and he'll have quite an impact for the Fijian side, I reckon he'd be good. Fiji bounced back to reach Sunday's quarter-finals, and so establish an unassailable lead at the top of the overall standings, after a 42-5 thrashing of Wales and 26-0 win over Australia. We have got a huge amount of players back home who have done some magnificent things for Fiji but have never won back-to-back series titles, said Fiji coach Ben Ryan, the former England sevens boss.
We had a difficult opening match but they were fighting tooth and nail there, just like against South Africa last year and they weren't going to take a backward step, added Ryan, whose side will now look to add Olympic gold to their trophy cabinet in Brazil. AFP

UAE thrashes Thailand 70-18
The United Arab Emirates convincingly beat Thailand 70 points (10 tries, 10 conversions) to 18 ( 2 Tries , 1 conversion, 2 Penalties) to win the Asia Rugby Championship Division 2 title and promotion to Division 1 next year in Dustlik Stadium, Tashkent, the Uzbekistan capital.
A spectacular game from centre Charlie Sargent who scored Two Tries to go along with his perfect kicking display of five conversions accounted 20 points for him personally and ensured that the UAE were never in danger of losing the game.
Thailand were still in the game until late into the second half thanks to tries from Adithep Keatpattanachai and Chinnoiwont Hirunchai and a generally stubborn performance, but then the floodgates opened and tries scored for UAE through wing Ryno Fourie (Two), fly-half Matthew Hutchings (Two), former St.Anthony's College - Kandy 1st XI cricket and 1st XV rugby captain cum later Trinity College fly half the multitalented UAE full-back Imad Reyal (Two Tries), Philip David Brady (One) and Jaen Botes (One) while Imad Reyal three conversions and Rikus Swar two conversions were the highlights.
Having dispatched hosts Uzbekistan earlier in the week, it was a very satisfying week for the UAE team. Earlier in the day, Uzbekistan were cruelly defeated by a single point as they went down to Guam 23-22 in the same venue. In front of a huge home crowd, the Uzbeks fell behind early and often, finding themselves 17-0 adrift after just half an hour.
But tries from replacement Dostou Arzikulov and their fearsome number eight Sanjar Sadullayev either side of half-time gave them some belief.
Then, a try from wing Abduvoris Karimov together with a penalty from Stanislav Krechun saw them take the lead 22-17 with just 15 minutes to go. But two late penalties from Guam Fijian born scrum-half Ratu Uluiviti were enough to see the men from the Pacific sneak home, much to the disappointment of the inconsolable Uzbeks.

Japan stuns South Korea 60-3
On a glorious sunny day at Asiad Rugby Field, the Japanese Brave Blossoms ran in 10 tries. But it was their defensive effort that pleased every one with 60 points to 3 win against South Korea in the end in Incheon, South Korea.
Japan gave up the first score of the game when Korean flyhalf Oh Ji Myeong banged over a penalty from halfway. But it was all Japan after that.
Atsushi Sakate opened the scoring for Japan in the fifth minute and the hooker was followed onto the score sheet in the first half by captain Keisuke Uchida (another superb individual effort) and Ryohei Yamanaka, who bagged a quick fire brace.
The Brave Blossoms were also awarded a penalty try and Yamanaka and Ryota Nakamura added a conversion apiece to make it 29-3 at the break.
Sakate opened the second half with his second try (like his first the result of a great driving maul) and there were further five-pointers for Kentaro Kodama, Kotaro Yatabe, Takuhei Yasuda and Ryuji Noguchi with Yamanaka adding two more conversions and Nakamura one.
However Japan coach said his sides kicking game was a lot better as was their intent to play the game in the right part of the field.
Japan have 15 points from three games and play Hong Kong in Round 5, with the final game of the tournament set for June 4 when South Korea visit Hong Kong. (WAI)
