Present govt. doesnt use kangaroo courts to convict corrupt
The present government does not apply the law in kangaroo courtstyle like the ex-regime did, Minister Harin Fernando said yesterday. The present government does it by the book, and the people who are not accustomed to such mature democracy find fault with us.
Minister Fernando said that he accepts that there are delays in executing law against corruption and misuse of public money, but observed that the process will be accelerated after establishing the anti-corruption high courts.
Most of these corrupt persons act macho because of the laws delays. They can buy time, but not for long. When the anti-corruption high courts are up and running, things will change. Some people hold us responsible for the laws delays.
We cannot take the law into our own hands, like the ex-regime took Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka into custody. We dont use Rajapaksas way to execute the law. We take the right way, slow as it is. However, I believe it is better late than never, he said.
MInister Fernando was speaking at a press conference held at Sirikotha yesterday morning.
He said that many have mistaken the mature democracy policy upheld by the government to be a weak characteristic. We are not dictators. But most of our people are used to dictatorship. When the TNL repeater transmission tower was closed down, MPs representing both the government and the Opposition rose to raise their concerns. Would it have been possible under the previous regime Now, we criticize the President and the Prime Minister. People and trade unions are freely holding demonstrations, fighting for their rights. This is mature democracy. Following the proper legal procedures is not a failure of the government, it is success, he said.
Referring to the recent emotional farewell given by the rehabilitated ex-LTTE cardres to Commander of Civil Security Department in Mullaittivu, Colonel Ranapriya Bandu, Minister Fernando observed that it is this kind of humane military the country needs. Strength is not fighting, it is how much one can win peoples hearts, he said.
This is how the military should reach the general public. Militarisation promoted by former the defence secretary is not the way. There is a new Friday tabloid newspaper that has attacked me. According to certain sources, the funds for this newspaper come from a person in Kandy, a Gota-bhaya disciple, Minister Fernando said.

SL on path to consolidating laws, curbing discrimination
Inclusive and sustainable growth could not be achieved sans a proper approach to quell the inequalities faced by the workforce, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera said.
He was addressing the Plenary Meeting of the International Labour Conferences (ILC) 107th Session, recently. The meeting was held from May 28 to June 9.
Highlighting a number of Sri Lankas achievements in the field of labour, Minister Samaraweera added that being the first country in the world to implement a National Decent Work Plan on par with the ILOs principles, Sri Lanka had also given priority to labour rights through its inclusion in the National Human Rights Action Plan 2017-2021.
Sri Lanka was in the process of introducing a Single Employment Law, consolidating the current inefficient laws and curbing discrimination, the minister said; the country had also taken measures to prevent child labour and to promote childrens rights, while offering its support the ILOs endeavours.
The minister highlighted the need to consider practical measures, including flexible working hours, creating a positive atmosphere for all workers, in order to increase productivity. He said trade unions could play a key role in making workers understand the changing global work environment. Stressing the need to break through prevailing stereotypes in order to achieve gender equality, he focused on the necessity for awareness-raising within society.
During his discussion with ILO Director-General Guy Ryder, Minister Samaraweera expressed Sri Lankas interest to be at the forefront of the ILOs global and regional efforts, along with other relevant stakeholders striving to eliminating child and forced labour. He assured Sri Lankas support for declaring 2021 as the Year of Elimination of Child Labour and expressed the countrys willingness to become a Pathfinder Country of Alliance 8.7.
Sri Lanka is currently considering the ratification of ILO Protocol 29 to the Forced Labour Convention.
The ILO Director-General said Sri Lanka was an important partner of the ILO, adding that he held Sri Lankas ongoing efforts to promote labour rights in high regard, particularly, the measurers to eliminate child labour. In this context, Ryder recalled pledges made by Sri Lanka at the IV Global Conference on Sustained Eradication of Child Labour, in Buenos Aires, November, 2017, including to raise the minimum age of employment from 14 to 16. He also requested Sri Lanka to be actively involved in the Centenary Celebration activities of the ILO which would be held in 2019.
Minister Samaraweera was accompanied by Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in Geneva Ambassador A. L. A. Azeez, Labour Commissioner-General R. P. A. Wimalaweera, Deputy Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka Samantha Jayasuriya, Minister Counsellor Shashika Somaratne, Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry Senior Assistant Secretary B. Vasanthan and other senior officials.

GPPAC-RCSS Week 2018 discusses armed conflict
Call to youth, faith leaders to become peace-builders
As 60 to 70 percent of resolved conflicts relapse, it is necessary to address the root causes generating a conflict, Regional Centre for Strategic Studies (RCSS) Executive Director Prof. Gamini Keerawella said, at the media conference held in Colombo, last week.
The prevention of conflicts and ensuring a safer environment for citizens is essential as it will pave the way for the socio-development of a country. The RCSS emphasises the fact that root causes should be addressed in preventing an armed conflict, and peace-building initiatives should be encouraged at all times, Prof. Keerawella said.
Young people as peace-builders and faith leaders as role models in the peace-building process will be important elements, and this will prevent the huge losses on the economic front, where the cost of conflict on a countrys resources is enormous. The voice of non-elected members could play a crucial role in disseminating the message of peace in a conflict-ridden environment, he said,
The RCSS has been the South Asian regional secretariat of the Global Partnership for Prevention of Armed Conflicts (GPPAC) since its inception in 2003. Sri Lanka currently holds the executive directorship of the RCSS, which held the GPPAC-RCSS Week 2018 last week in Colombo.
Prof. Keerawella said peace-building initiatives should be carried out at community level by building bridges to improve harmony and reconciliation among the communities. Conflict dynamism creates its own culture and the demilitarisation process is important to ensure peace.
The role the media can play in the direction of preventing armed conflict is important and critical. We consider the media to be one of our close partners, Prof. Keerawella said.
GPPAC RCSS Week has taken place in Colombo at a historic time, locally and globally. The international political system is presently undergoing decisive changes. The emergence of international public space has put an end to the monopoly enjoyed by international political space in global politics. It is a process that began decades ago.
In this context, international non-government organisations have come forward to play an increasingly important role in deciding the global political agenda. Today, international non-governmental organisations are a definite fixture in international relations, capable and proving their capacity for official diplomacy. Most of their initiatives can be seeing as a progress in track iii diplomacy or backchannel diplomacy. Furthermore, global armed conflict patterns have also undergone a decisive change.
Locally, in Sri Lanka, we are emerging after 30 years of armed conflict. One of the key concerns in Sri Lanka is how to prevent the recurrence of armed conflict that brought enormous pain and destruction, irrespective of ethnicity or faith, Prof. Keerawella said.
Armed conflicts are varied and complex. Conventional inter-state and intra-state conflict division is not valid in the present context. Some internal armed conflicts are proxy wars involving states.
In the Cold war context, attention was mainly on armed conflict involving states, while intra-state conflicts were considered a law and order issue. The dramatic rise of the human toll in intra-regional conflicts has made intra-state conflicts also an international concern.
Each conflict is unique and each peace is unique. There is no specific way to peace. Peace is the way. We can draw lessons from other peace initiatives, but it is hardly possible to copy them, Prof. Keerawella said.
The prevention of armed conflict is an important element of peace. The general perception is that prevention is relevant in pre-conflict and post-conflict scenarios, but not in conflict scenarios, as there is nothing to prevent. This is not correct. In all three scenarios, prevention is important, as prevention is a social and political process, he said.
It is not possible to create a conflict-free society. The issue is not conflict, but violent conflict. When arms are used to resolve conflicts, the outcome is violence. Transforming the dynamics of conflict to dynamics of social progress is the challenge before us. It is necessary to understand the difference between dissent and subversion. Dissent should be viewed as an important element and safety valve of democratic governance.
In certain political situations, non-violent resistance can be a propellant for social progress and democratic political transformation. Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and Mandela used this strategy of non-violence as a mechanism to repair social and political ills.
The prevention of armed conflict is a responsibility of the entire human race. In view of the lethality of arms produced by states, the survival of the human race depends on our ability to prevent armed conflict. In all conflicts, civil society can and must play a critical role in promoting the prevention of armed conflict, Prof. Keerawella said.

CEB Engineers call off strike
The CEB Engineers who had threatened to suspend work at the Norochcholai coal power plant yesterday, suspended the strike temporarily as the CEB had met some of their demands, CEB Engineers Union President Athula Wanniarachchi said.
The PUCSL had notified the CEB General Manager that it had approved the Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion plan 2018-2037 after an extensive public consultation process on July 19, 2017.
It said the commission had requested the government policy on the fuel mix according to section 5 of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act no. 20 of 2009 from the Secretary of the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy prior to arriving at the decision.
However, no response had been received by the Commission in this regard and they had approved the Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan 2018-2037 based on the Least Cost principals as per the section 43 (8) of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act.
He told the Daily News that the scheduled strike action was suspended as the CEB had accepted their plan. The two core demands made by the CEBEU was the granting of approval to the Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) 2018-2037 and appointing professionals with high integrity and an unblemished record to key posts in the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL).
We have decided to temporarily suspend our strike action, but there are unclear areas that still needs to be addressed by the CEB management. They claim that what we have submitted is the plan for the previous year (Past plan) and that the conditions should be in accordance with the new governments policy.
We submitted the plan in 2017. So how could we have submitted a plan at that time based on policies that were declared in 2018 With regard to our second key demand of appointing a professional with high integrity as PUCSL Director General, the process has been initiated by the authorities, but it still needs to be implemented, he said, adding that once these demands are all met, they would decide if the strike action would be called off or not.
He added that these issues would be discussed with the CEB authorities and a decision would be made. However, he said that for the moment, the CEBEU had taken the decision to suspend the proposed strike action.
Further, the Letter sent by the PUCSL Chairman to the CEB General Manager states that the Commission approved LCLTGEP 2018-2037 and CEB submitted base case plan, both do not fully comply with the energy mix of the new government policy. Hence, the Commission has directed the Transmission Licensee to resubmit the plan complying with the latest government policy.
The Commission has therefore, granted approval for the CEB base case plan subjected to the accommodation of already Cabinet approved Government to government power plants and the latest Government Policy.

Contest to fete public officials
Transparency International Sri Lanka announced Tuesday, that it was launching a new islandwide Integrity Idol contest to identify and felicitate exemplary public officials.
(This) is a very unique public award to recognise integrity in public service, TISL Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekere said, speaking at a press conference at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute yesterday.
The key concept here is to name and fame public officers, he said. Because we wish to recognize those public officers who have shown integrity and honesty sometimes in very challenging and difficult conditions.
Obeyesekere asked the public to nominate people they knew at any level of government, from schoolteachers to customs officers, whom they believed performed their role with honesty and integrity. We very frequently hear negative news around the public service, he said. But I think the one thing we can all agree on is that there are also many positive examples of people working in the public service that is often unrecognized.
Islandwide voting is now open, and nominations can be made until 31 July. Five finalists will then be chosen by a panel of judges, Obeyesekere said, and then the public will select a winner through SMS voting.
The public sector must have a high level of integrity, retired Deputy Auditor General and one of the contests judges M.D.A. Harold said. This is a good effort and good arrangement to allow the public to appreciate the integrity of public servants, he said.
Anyone wishing to make a nomination can call TISL at 0711 295295 or 0761 178844.
Nomination forms in all three languages can also be downloaded online at www.integrityidol.lk, or collected at TISLs head office at 5/1 Elibank Road Colombo 5 or its legal aid centres in Matara and Vavuniya.
After the panel selects five finalists, their stories will be filmed and shown on TV and social media. People can then vote for their favourite public official over SMS.
The final award will be given in October.
The Integrity Idol is organised with the Accountablity Lab, which has already carried out similar campaigns in Nepal, Pakistan, South Africa, and Nigeria.

Following the devastating floods and landslides which have struck Sri Lanka over the last weeks, the European Commission gave 160,000 (around Rs 29 million) in humanitarian funding to bring emergency assistance to the communities affected by the recent floods.
Some 17,500 people in the seven most affected districts of the country will benefit from the aid. Priority will be given to those who have been displaced. This EU funding supports the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society in delivering relief assistance to those families who are currently living in temporary shelters or evacuation centres.They will receive cash grants which will enable them to purchase essential household items.Priority will be given to access to clean water and sanitation, particularly through the cleaning of wells with contaminated water. First aid and medical services will also be provided, together with hygiene awareness sessions to avoid the spread of waterborne diseases.
The funding is part of the EUs overall contribution to the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).
Since May 19, the southwest monsoon weather conditions have caused heavy rainfalls in the southwest parts, triggering floods and landslides in various locations. According to information released by the national Disaster Management Center, close to 175,000 people have been affected across 19 districts, and 26 people killed. Puttalam, Gampaha, Ratnapura, Colombo, Kurunegala, Kalutara and Kegalle are among the worst affected districts.

The government will soon introduce a new insurance scheme for plantation workers, Lanka Jathika Estate Workers Union (LJEWU) General Secretary, Vadivel Suresh said.
Discussions relating to the proposal of the insurance scheme is presently ongoing, he said.
Speaking at a press conference held at the UNP headquarters Pitakotte yesterday morning,
Suresh observed that the estate community had much confidence on the United National Party and its Leader Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to elevate their living status.
He pointed out that UNP has immensely contributed to the uplift of the estate community, including the right to vote, land rights, government jobs and educational facilities. Thus, he said the fifteen hundred thousand votes in the estate community stands with the UNP. Suresh also said that estate community is a decisive vote base when appointing leaders in the country and justified it as a reason to provide more facilities to the estate sector.
When inquired on the appointment of MP Cader Masthan as the Hindu Religious Affairs Deputy Minister, Suresh said the decision should be reconsidered. He said the appointment might cause unnecessary issues.
The post for Hindu Religious Affairs Deputy Minister was vacant for a very long time.There are enough Tamil MPs in Parliament. If you look at the recent ethnic tensions that rose in the country, this might also give rise to unnecessary problems.We are already receiving telephone calls inquiring about this appointment. We dont have anything personal against MP Cader, we are good friends. This puts both us and Cader in a difficult situation. I believe that this appointment should be reconsidered, Suresh said.
Suresh also spoke of the freshly launched Sathya (Truth) campaign by the UNP Central Media Unit. He also demanded that the list of 118 MPs who took money from Perpetual Treasuries Limited owner Arjun Aloysius who is involved in the Treasury bond issue. He pointed out that they cannot face the public due to the umbrella accusation of corruption and urged the President and the Prime Minister to soon out the said list.

Possible fuel crisis looming, warns Union leader
The inclement weather has delayed the unloading of a shipment of fuel at the Muthurajawela terminal with further delays being experienced due to a breakage of a hose, which could lead to a fuel shortage in the country if the situation is not brought under control, the Ceylon Petroleum Common Workers Union Secretary, D. J. Rajakaruna warned.
He warned that in the event there is a delay in a shipment, the country could once again face a serious fuel shortage.
Currently too there is a crisis brewing with the unloading at Muthurajawela being delayed by several days due to the inclement weather conditions and now that the weather has improved, a hose has been damaged, further delaying the fuel unloading, said Rajakaruna, adding that currently 75 percent of the fuel requirement is distributed through Muthurajawela and if there is a delay, this could affect the countrys fuel distribution process.
In addition, as crude oil, petrol and kerosene oil is being pumped through the two pipelines at Muthurajawela, these pipelines too have to be rinsed using sea water. It is said that this situation too would lead to a huge fuel crisis before long. Currently, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) only holds fuel buffer stocks for just 15 days and if a fuel shipment is delayed, as experienced previously, the country would inevitably face a serious fuel crisis.
Further compounding the problem, three of the five oil pipelines that pump crude oil from ships to the Kolonnawa refinery are out of service and as a result, the CPC is losing millions of rupees from each fuel shipment, he said.
Speaking to the Daily News, Rajakaruna said these pipelines are over 60-70 years old and currently, oil is being pumped through one operational 10-inch pipeline from the Port to the Kolonnawa refinery and furnace oil is being pumped through a 14-inch pipeline. However, unloading which should take around two days, now takes around eight days to complete a single shipment, causing the CPC millions of in demurrage charges.
The last pipeline to be operational was the 12-inch pipeline, but due to the wear and tear over the years and lack of maintenance, there were several leaks that eventually led to several houses catching fire.
Previously, a project was initiated for the restoration of these pipelines and in certain areas, offices were also established and some were also paid, but eventually it never materialised and the project was abandoned, he added.
The pipeline network that pumps the fuel from the harbour to the Kolonnawa refinery is parallel to the rail track and many squatters have constructed illegal houses along this pipeline network, hindering any repair or maintenance work on the pipelines. Some of them were even given compensation previously and evicted, but they have now returned and are still living in the same spot.
Meanwhile, tenders were called for the repair of the 12 pipeline, but it was later decided to deploy the CPC workers to repair and restore this pipeline.
However, although parts of the pipeline have been restored, it is not possible to test the pipeline, due to the illegal squatters.
Meanwhile, it is reported that due to the delay in unloading the oil shipments these ships are docked at the harbour for longer periods and the CPC has to pay demurrage fees of Rs. 3 - Rs. 5 million per ship per day.
It is also reported that as only two pipelines are operational for the pumping of diesel, petrol and aviation fuel, after each pumping operation, the pipeline has to be rinsed with sea water before the next type of fuel is pumped, which leads to the corrosion of the pipelines.

The MP also said that the agreement has an indefinite clause which prevents the termination of this agreement.
If the government decide to terminate this agreement, the Singaporean businessmen can lodge complains to the Industrial Dispute Settlement Court.
Therefore, this agreement should be presented in the Parliament.

Trump, Kim hail historic summit
Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un hailed their historic summit on Tuesday as a breakthrough in relations between Cold War foes, but the agreement they produced was short on details about the key issue of Pyongyangs nuclear weapons.
The extraordinary encounter saw the leader of the worlds most powerful democracy shake hands with the third generation scion of a dynastic dictatorship, standing as equals in front of their nations flags.
Kim agreed to the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, a stock phrase favoured by Pyongyang that fell short of long-standing US demands for North Korea to give up its atomic arsenal.
And in a blockbusting press conference after the summit, Trump said the US would halt military exercises with Seoul -- a long-term irritant for Pyongyang, which claims they are a rehearsal for invasion.
The exercises were not mentioned in the document that the two men signed.
We will be stopping the war games which will save us a tremendous amount of money, Trump told reporters, adding that at some point he wanted to withdraw US troops from the South.
Under the circumstances where were negotiating a very comprehensive agreement, I think its inappropriate to be having war games. That sparked immediate reaction from analysts.
Two more Trump concessions just in this presser: stopping US-S Korea military exercises and hope to withdraw US troops from SK, tweeted Robert Kelly, Professor of Political Science at Pusan National University.
Ahead of the meeting, critics expressed concerns that it risked being more about media headlines than substantive progress.
Asked about denuclearisation -- the crux of the summit -- Trump said, were starting that process, adding that it would begin very, very quickly. Speaking to reporters, he said there would be a process of verification involving a lot of people, but gave no concrete details.
He also insisted that US sanctions would remain in place until Washington had seen progress.
The text of the two mens agreement made no mention of previous US demands for complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation -- jargon for scrapping weapons and committing to inspections. - AFP

Yan oya reservoir to be filled by September  Minister Duminda
Irrigation Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayaka revealed that arrangements will be finalized for filling the Horowpothana Yan oya reservoir which has been prolonging since the beginning of 2017.
Speaking to Daily News with regard to the lining up of the project and the development plans coming under his Ministry, the Minister said further that for accelerating the slow progress being shown concerning lower Malwathuoya reservoir project mainly due to lack of allocations, steps are being taken to entrust the construction work to an acceptable foreign investor most probably the Chinese CAMC company. The CAMC completed the head work of Yan oya reservoir project including the main dam one year in advance and presently entrusted with the speedy construction of 21 km long reservoir's left bank canal way.
The Minister stated that once completed, both reservoirs will bear a water capacity of 318.000 acre feet capable of irrigating around 60,000 acres, The total cost amounting to Rs. 48,500 million.
Referring to the restrictions over the issue of Rs. 5,000 worth dry food ration to the drought affected farmer families in Anuradhapura district, the Minister said that according to the norms and criteria indicated in the Disaster Management Ministry recent circular, the number of families by last year's August eligible for the food ration which amounted to around 159,000 has dropped in to 59,420 at the end of last March and again cut down to 48,462 families by the District Disaster Management Unit. He said that although the drought is continuing, with intermittent rains experienced, tanks got some water and farmers have taken to cultivation even at smaller extents. The drought relief shall be offered only to those solely depending on agriculture for sustenance and not blessed with any yielding during the last three cultivation seasons. However, I intervened in this matter and now the number of beneficiary families have been enhanced up to 70,000, Dissanayake emphasized.
The Minister referred also to the controversial Thambuttegama, Rajanganaya water scheme was at a standstill due to the grave opposition of the Rajangane farmers against the proposed intake of water from Rajangane tank to run the Thambuttegama water project. The proposal has been granted cabinet approval in 2014. The Chinese government has signed agreement to provide financial assistance worth around Rs. 19,000 million. A contractor has been chosen and advance payment made already, he added.
I personally am agreeable to realize this project, provided that the Rajangane farmers consented to it. I have called for a detailed report from Irrigation Department showcasing the water capacity variations, water spilling nature etc of the Rajangane reservoir and the water flowing pattern of the Kalayoya, the feeder river of Rajangane during the last 15 years before taking a final decision. Also, I have requested the views of the Water Supply Ministry regarding the proposed project for me to study the situation, Dissanayake emphasized.
He said that there were proposals from various quarters including the farmer organisations, such as tapping water from Kala oya close to the bridge over it at Thambuttegama along Anuradhapura - Puttlam main road, and the possibility of getting the intake that would be 18,000 cubic meters per day. The Minister said that the he would instruct the Irrigation Department to look into the possibility of constructing a mini reservoir between Neelabemma project and Gamgewadiya located in Wilpaththuwa sanctuary where the Kala oya river joined the sea as an alternative solution.
The Kala oya basin is the third longest river in the country of which the length is around 145 km. There has been a consultancy assignment for reviewing the present status of water availability in Kala oya river basin and thereby to decide the possibility of extracting 25,300 cubic meter of water per day from Rajangane reservoir to fulfill the water supply demand of Eppawala, Rajangane, Nochchiyagama, Giribawa and Thambuttegama water supply schemes, without compromising the water requirements of other water users, the Minister pointed out further.
