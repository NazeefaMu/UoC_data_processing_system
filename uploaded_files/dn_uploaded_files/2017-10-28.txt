Bill to ensure university standards
A Bill will be brought to Parliament to ensure the standard of State and private universities, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
According to Minister Kiriella, the standard of State universities in Sri Lanka is low compared to international standards. Universities in countries in the same region such as India and Bangladesh, have higher standards than Sri Lankan universities.
The Minister was addressing the inauguration of the Fifth International Conference on Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Traditional Medicine in Colombo, yesterday.
According to Minister Kiriella, universities gain higher standards and climb up in world ranking by establishing international links. Universities should recruit foreign students.
However, only a few Sri Lankan State universities follow instructions given to them to recruit 10 percent foreign students.
Minister Kiriella said it is the United National Party which introduced free education in Sri Lanka. Therefore, it will never do away with free education. Three more State medical faculties will be established soon. Local State universities go down in world ranking due to demonstrations staged by university students.
A large number of local and foreign delegates were present at the conference. The conference will end on October 29.

Brexit: EU bank may not fully repay UK until 2054
Billions of euros of British taxpayers money could remain locked into an EU bank for more than thirty years after Brexit, the UK has been warned.
Alexander Stubb, vice president of the European Investment Bank - in which the UK is a 16% shareholder - said it would not be fully repaid until 2054.
He described Brexit as a travesty but denied the move was a punishment.
The EIB has leveraged the economy of the UK many, many fold over the years, he told BBC Radio 4s Today.
The UK has 3.5bn euros (3.1bn) of capital at the bank and a House of Lords report said the UKs investment could be worth 10.1bn (8.9bn) euros taking into account reserves and profits.
Established in 1958, the EIB uses capital provided by EU countries to make loans at low rates, often for major infrastructure projects.

Case against Welgama fixed for January 12
The Colombo Chief Magistrates Court yesterday fixed for January 12, the corruption case filed against former Transport Minister Kumara Welgama for allegedly causing an unlawful loss to the government after appointing an individual as a Deputy Chairman of Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) in contrary to the Transport Act. 
When the case came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala, the Court was informed that Kumara Welgama has filed a revision application in the High Court challenging the Magistrates Court decision to accept amended charge sheets filed against the former Minister by Bribery Commission. The High Court is yet to deliver a verdict in this regard.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against former Minister Welgama under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on four charges. The Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had unlawfully appointed L. A. Wimalaratne as the Deputy Chairman of the SLTB on June 23, 2010, while he was serving as the Transport Minister.
The Bribery Commission further alleged that the Former Minister had paved the way to confer a payment of Rs.3.2 million to the Deputy Chairman as his salary and other benefits, causing an unlawful loss to the government.

Cattle transport licences suspended
President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed to temporarily suspend issuing licenses to transport cattle.
Incidents of illegal transporting of cattle are rapidly increasing, while these activities had a huge impact on the dairy industry as well as agricultural needs.
Accordingly, until an appropriate process is implemented, the issuing of licenses to transport cattle would be temporarily suspended. At present, the issuing of licenses to transport cattle is initiated by the District Secretary. Various serious accidents and incidents resulting in fatality have been reported from different parts of the country, when illegally transporting cattle and a tragic incident reported from Bulankulama Anuradhapura, where two young women died in an accident on Thursday.

Cricket is rotting away.  Everything worthwhile about it is being destroyed
In Asia, it is being wrecked from the top down: by corrupt administrators, politicians, businessmen and bookmakers while the kids still play in every available back alley and rice paddy.
Thirty years ago, when he was newly retired as a player and before he was canonised (if not yet knighted) for his performances as a jolly old card on Test Match Special, Geoffrey Boycott appeared on the Radio 4 programme In the Psychiatrists Chair.
The interviewer, Dr Anthony Clare, casually mentioned that cricket was a team game. Boycott denied it. No, its 11 individuals as a team. What a giveaway, thought the massed ranks of cricket-loving, Radio 4-listening, amateur psychiatrists. Boycott had finally admitted what his contemporaries always claimed: that he played for himself.
A generation later came Kevin Pietersen, Boycotts polar opposite in his style of play but his long-lost son in terms of team-mate relations. Consider the differences, though: Boycott, between 1962 and 1986, played 414 first-class matches for Yorkshire (maybe he only ever played for Boycottshire but that isnt the point), 108 Tests for England and only bits and pieces for anyone else.
Pietersen, in a less enduring career, has played for three English counties, a South African province and six specialist Twenty20 teams in four different countries, none of them yet his native South Africa or his adopted England. With power to add.
Pietersen played 104 Tests and without them he would have been a nobody. But he is the harbinger of a new world, in which Test cricket is becoming irrelevant, even on a players CV, a world in which it is becoming possible to make millions from playing without getting more than a cursory mention in Wisden. Without even having a team at all except as a very temporary hook-up in the Twenty20 leagues: something more than a one-night stand and less than a holiday romance. Perhaps KP can remember all the Twenty20 teams he has played for. It seems unlikely that he can remember whether or not his presence helped the Quetta Gladiators or the St Lucia Zouks actually win a trophy, unless there was a contractual clause that made it matter to him.
This is not the game that enraptured me when I was six years old. Nor the game I have written about happily for much of my adult life. I dont care about the St Lucia Zouks. And I wont care about whatever names the 12-year olds in marketing invent for the new made-up teams when the existing English Twenty20 is engulfed by yet another new competition in the years ahead. This wretched idea was sold to the county chairmen by bribery  an annual 1.3m sweetener per county  with a tacit undercurrent of threat.
My only interest  in common with many other cricket lovers  is the hope that the damnable thing is a total flop and that we can somehow save the game I once adored, and still love more than the people who have seized control of it. One can say that athletics is in crisis but at least we can be sure that, as long as humanity survives, kids will still try to run faster than their classmates. Crickets crisis is an existential one.
Everything worthwhile about it is being destroyed: its culture that the umpires decision is final; the delicate balance between bat and ball as the game degenerates into a six-hitting contest; and that even more delicate balance between individual and team that made it imperative for even the most militant individualists not to laugh out loud if ones own magnificent century failed to save the team from defeat.
It is rotting in different ways in different places. In Asia, it is being wrecked from the top down: by corrupt administrators, politicians, businessmen and bookmakers while the kids still play in every available back alley and rice paddy. In Britain, it is happening mainly from the bottom up, as village cricket disintegrates and the once ubiquitous informal cricket of playground, park and back garden is crushed by the power of football, even in high summer. When did you last see a group of children (public schools and Asian community partially excepted) playing cricket without an adult The cricket that does take place is increasingly argumentative and bad tempered; ask any club umpire.
This does not make the England and Wales Cricket Board guiltless. It is responsible for the catastrophic decision (crickets live now, suffer later version of PFI) to take the game away from the public and hand it to Sky  which took effect at the very moment of triumph in 2005 when the nation had just reignited its love affair with Test match cricket.
And this was merely the most devastating error. There have been decades of twisting, turning, fiddling and farting around with the fixture lists. When does a Test match now start Search me. What about county matches Heaven alone knows, if even heaven now bothers. But you can generally rule out June, July or August, the months of high summer.
The ECB still employs a few people with some knowledge of cricket, but even they seem to have zero understanding of the games rhythms. Which are the Test matches that still habitually draw crowds Lords, The Oval, Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne. What do they have in common Predictability  so that friends can get together every year and watch the games companionably. Sometimes with panamas and bottles of Chardonnay; sometimes dressed as Elvis holding pints of lager. But the authorities are trying to wreck even this, by staging Oval Tests in July and Lords Tests in May and September. And in 2018 there will be no Tests at all between 5 June and 1 August. They just dont get it.
One has long ago given up any hope of anything worthwhile emerging from the Dubaivory tower where sits the International Cricket Council. It has, so far as I can discover, three aims in life: the accumulation of money; its own self-aggrandisement; and the largely bogus expansion of the game designed to impress bodies such as the International Olympic Committee (the ICC claims 104 member countries, most of them places where cricket is played almost wholly by expats); it has not (yet) taken the Laws of Cricket away from MCC, but it often imposes new regulations, of varying degrees of stupidity. And no figure of genuine cricketing stature has held the most powerful job (variously called president or chairman) at the ICC since Sir Clyde Walcott bowed out 20 years ago.
The latest wheeze is to reinvigorate Test cricket by providing a final, now scheduled for Lords circa 2021. Where we do start with this crackpot plan First, the essence of Test cricket is that it constitutes a complex form of arm-wrestling, in which superiority reveals itself over a long period of time. A single match, played in particular circumstances, proves nothing, as any fule kno.
Second, if the final is between, say, New Zealand and South Africa, who the hell will pay to watch Third, does anyone at the ICC even know that there are three common results to a Test match, including the draw, which is part of crickets under-appreciated genius. Even if one team is completely superior, it still has to complete victory within the allotted time frame. And even a team staring at defeat still has the possibility of escape.
So what happens if the final is a draw Will the team with the better overall record be declared champion, in which case they have no incentive to take any risks Or do they share what will undoubtedly be big prize money, that being the only language the ICC understands In which case, they might well agree to share that in advance.
I am credited with originating the current Test championship, which is sort of true. As editor of Wisden, I came up with the idea in 1995 and for a while it attracted considerable attention, especially in 1999 when England managed to hit rock bottom, below even Zimbabwe.
Then I made what may well be (despite many other contenders) the biggest damn-fool mistake of my life and handed the table over to the ICC for what I imagined was the benefit of cricket. As soon as they got their mitts on it they abandoned the straightforward system I had devised and handed it over to a statistician, using a method no one except him has ever understood.
As this stands, India are apparently the best Test team in the world although they have not won an away series against England since 2007 and not at all in Australia. And they havent played Pakistan in a Test for a decade. Yet, we are told, they are the reigning champions.
There are potential ways forward, one of which, emanating from Andrew Strauss and supported by Mike Atherton, involves using the three different forms of the game to produce one champion.
This is worth discussion. I tried proposing something similar to revive county cricket years ago but it got lost in a Lords committee room.
Cricket is not beyond salvation. One thing is certain: the current omnishambles will never be resolved by the dunderheads in Dubai.

Declaration of Sainthamaruthu Pradeshiya Sabha, only if parties agree - Minister
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha said that a decision regarding the request to establish a Pradeshiya Sabha in Sainthamaruthu will be taken only after discussions with all relevant political parties in the area.
All political parties should agree unanimously to make a change, the Minister addressing the media at his Ministry yesterday. The people have been demanding for a separate Pradeshiya sabha in Sainthamaruthu, from the Kalmunai Municipal Council area since 1988. However, it gained momentum only after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe promised during his election campaign that he would declare a Sainthamaruthu Pradeshiya Sabha on the request of Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader Rauf Hakeem.
Minister Mustapha said the Prime Minister is happy to establish a Pradeshiya sabha in Sainthamaruthu.There are issues in declaration as there were also suggestions to divide the Kalmunai Municipal Council into four Pradeshiya Sabhas.
"Therefore, a final decision pertaining to declaring Sainthamaruthu Pradeshiya Sabha cannot be taken without the consent of all political parties in that area," he said.

Deepening democracy
It is a fact that this government has cleared the fascistic garbage left behind by the Mahinda regime. It is an achievement accepted by democratic people world over. However one has to concede that this set of achievements does not include most of the priority measures mentioned in the documents of international human rights officials, made over two years ago.
It makes obvious that the democratic process is nowhere close to where it should be. These expectations were not merely those of the international community but of the Yahapalanaya and of democratic Lankans generally. It was the Governments 100 Day Programme that made commitments to its people concerning accountability.
The country committed itself to establishing in a two-year period (which lapsed in March of this year) measures on four different areas including, truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of no recurrence.
It is true in a world in which nation states are still the basic units of political organisation, the human rights architecture that they collectively construct is first and foremost, the expression of commitments to their own citizens, beyond being voluntary pledges. Primarily it shows the power of working people united internationally, because they bring pressure for better human rights, whatever government in power.
Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA)
Some of the pending issues mentioned in related documents include: the release of land, the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and its replacement by legislation that is fully compliant with human rights standards, the establishment of a mechanism to review expeditiously the cases of those held under the PTA, and the cessation of overbearing and intimidating forms of surveillance especially against women and human rights activists, left behind by the fascistic regime. To this, it is necessary to add the harassment of those involved in memorialization initiatives in the North and East. Each of these issues involves questions of basic rights and thus, the continued failure to achieve progress in fully addressing them constitutes a denial of justice.
Furthermore, the delays raise questions in many quarters about the determination of the government to undertake a comprehensive transitional justice programme. Although the land occupied by the Armed Forces, in some cases for decades, has been returned, the lack of clarity and comprehensiveness in the process is still a problem. In this work where the Armed Forces are both a party and the Judge, may have serious consequences from a developmental standpoint.
There is broad understanding among international community, of the fact that Lanka faced in the past serious security challenges based on Tamil national problem. Thus, Lanka has not only the right, but the obligation, to provide security for all, compatible with human rights and other standards such as right of self-determination.
Similarly, there is an understanding in the international community, of the challenges faced by countries that attempt to face legacies of abuses while they simultaneously engage in democratizing and ambitious constitutional reforms. However, long delays between the acknowledgment of obligations to establish transitional justice measures and the fulfilment of these obligations involve risks: no one should be under the impression that waiting is a costless alternative.
While the battle for better human rights and a democratic constitution is at the centre of stage, one pundit explains to us When a pot of water heats up, small bubbles form, then bigger bubbles form, and convection currents begin to cause much agitation, increase of entropy and turbulence; the water is ready to undergo a phase transition. Water becomes steam. Social systems too, when highly stressed show increasing social turmoil, disruption and corruption. The normal course of justice is thwarted and those who control the purse begin to loot it.
Vaguely he is explaining the social change as explained by Karl Marx. Lanka has passed a revolution in the presidential election and the struggle against negative forces is not yet over. If one goes by the news reports, Lanka is in a state close to conclude the transition that started with the victory of President Maithripala Sirisena. He has enough executive powers to take action and to arrest the negative forces with the support of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. But, instead, an additional factor of conflict has been introduced by the attempt to stop change the rule book enabling devolution of the power and purse, to satisfy the democrats inside and outside the country.
Surely, given this cyber age where even a colony on the moon can be run from Cape Canaveral, devolution is a must for controlling power of ruling elites. Yet, fake histories are put forward to justify the arrest of such transfer of the power and purse, to the people who have traditionally lived in their so-called traditional homelands. They misquote from Ramayana, Arabian nights, both Bible and Koran to create unnecessary issues to counter historical truth and reality.
Re-writing the constitution
On the other hand, some who forgotten the gravity of the nationality problem, have pointed out that the priority should be to resolving civil discontent that is threatening not only the government but every citizens well- being! According to their Marxist analysis, apparently proletarian uprising is on the way. No joke they are serious.
Hence they have questioned the need for re-writing the constitution at this hour. The first concern of a man falling into a fire cannot be a re-writing of the regulations for the fire brigade!
The external pressure for the change of constitution put in by the US, UK and others working with a powerful diaspora, has been sharply questioned, apparently this time not by Malwatta-Asgiri Theras but by some Lords in the British House of Lords, affirming what these pundits had already asserted. So, if the government wishes to abandon these divisive projects, it only has to capture the golden moment to suppress proletarians with the help of foreign friends. And yet, unfortunately the rewriting of the constitution seems to be so important to the government that the Prime Minister attacked newspaper editors in public for reporting the opposition of the Mahanayake to the attempt to change the constitution! Pundit asks is there a hidden meaning behind all this
Political leadership
Both President and PM have come along different routes with different experiences. One is a village leader with a communist leaning to start with; the other is a Colombo Seven Royalist but with a father one time theoretician of Trotskyite Samasamajist movement grinning at him all the time!
However they have made a political combination in the category of social liberalism. So far they have faced criticism from all sides and moved forward. Still a massive peoples movement is active in the hope of achieving under this political leadership.
The attacks made by the fascistic opposition including the so-called unprecedented financial scandals are still treated as non entity by these liberal leaders. On the other hand while many investigations are made, and many arrests are made, no one is really caught and punished. This has become a negative aspect of social liberalism.
The inability to sharply break from chauvinism and eagerness of liberal duo to make compromises with certain leaders responsible for establishing fascism has created suspicion and anger among active leaders of mass democratic movement.
It is a defect identified by Trotsky, that liberal leaders are unable to stand firmly against chauvinism and to overthrow corrupt backward regimes to establish democracy. In Lanka, can the liberal leaders go ahead attacking chauvinist elements, finally to carry out the democratic duty of establishment of a constitution with a satisfactory power sharing

Fastest man taken on a flying lap by Lewis Hamilton / I thought I was about to die - Usain Bolt
Usain Bolt is no stranger to speed but the worlds fastest runner admitted he thought he was about to die as Lewis Hamilton drove him around the Circuit of the Americas.
The pre-race stunt, in a lime-green Mercedes AMG roadcar with No 1 emblazoned on the livery, put the wind up Bolt, with Hamilton saying: I was on the limit.
We nearly crashed several times. I wasnt looking where I was going. Dont do that at home.
He may be the fastest dude in the world, but I thought I would scare him. He had to retire before risking doing that with me, but its an honour to have him here.
In a video of the incident, posted to Bolts official Instagram, the eight-time Olympic champion screamed: I wasnt ready. You tried to kill me. I made it, but you tried to kill me.
Hamilton completed a couple of laps with Bolt on a day the sports new owners, Liberty Media, tried to put the Super Bowl into Formula One.
However it was not without controversy as Stevie Wonder was mysteriously pulled from the pre-race ceremonies, despite Liberty issuing a press release earlier in the week confirming his participation.
The late withdrawal prompted speculation that the singer may have knelt during his rendition of the national anthem in protest over racial discrimination, a trend that started in the NFL but not one Liberty wanted to overshadow the race. Liberty declined to comment on the change of plan.
Bolt was still involved in the theatrics, sending the cars on their formation lap and striking his famous lightning pose.
After retiring following the World Championships in London in August, when he pulled up with a hamstring injury, the 31-year-old is looking to a future in football, saying: For me its a personal goal. I dont care what people think about it. Im not going to lie to myself. Im not going to be stupid.
If I feel I cant do it, Im going to say, You know what, forget this. Im not trying to embarrass myself. But if I go out there and feel I can do this then I will give it a try. Its a dream and another chapter of my life.  Daily Mail

Fiscal Responsibility Management Bill soon - Central Bank Governor
Central Bank Governor Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy revealed a host of policy frameworks planned to institutionalise sustained and sound macro-economic policies yesterday.
He said a strong legal and accountability framework will be embedded with them, that in extreme cases the Central Bank Governor will have to resign.
He was delivering the keynote speech at the 32nd Sri Lanka Economic Association Annual Sessions at the Auditorium of the Center for Banking Studies in Rajagiriya.
Explaining these frameworks, the Governor said consistency and predictability in policy making are expected by institutionalizing them.The Government will bring in a Fiscal Responsibility Management Bill. The Fiscal Responsibility Management Act, that we have, has no teeth.
We need to strengthen it. The bill will provide provisions that any deviation from the targets made could only be for specified reasons, be that be natural disasters etc. If you do deviate from the targets then you must chart a clear way back to get through the target he explained.
Commenting on the framework on the monetary policy, the Governor said the CB is in the process of putting in place a flexible inflation targeting review. We are trying to be much more proactive and forward looking in our monetary policy. In the past, there has been significant fiscal forbearance and the CB tendered to do too little, too late. The CB is in the process of strengthening its forecast and modelling capabilities. The idea is to embed these with legal and accountability framework. In the extreme cases the accountability framework involves that the CB Governor has to resign he added.
Moving into the exchange rate, the Governor observed the country has to have a competitive exchange rate to get the much-needed exposure and enter the global market. It is time we put in place a framework for managing the exchanging rate. We will stop subsidizing foreign producers. Over the past, we have developed a practice of trying to defend a fixed rate by depleting cash resources. We have to do away with it, he noted.
The final framework is related to liability management. Our debt matrix is daunting. However we are confident that we can efficiently manage the debt. We will introduce a Liability Management Act which will enable the Government to borrow more than the requirement for the Budget of that particular year. For the moment, the Appropriation Act limits Government borrowing through finance into deficits in the Budget. With the new legislation, we can collect extra money to manage our future debts, he revealed.

## Title: Hello, Melbourne
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial

Hello, Melbourne
SriLankan Airlines will be flying to Melbourne, Australia from tomorrow after a lapse of many years. This will be a daily 8,360 Km flight that connects Colombo to Melbourne, which has the biggest Sri Lankan Diaspora in Australia. It will obviate the need to change planes at Singapore, which will cut travel time by at least three hours. The flight will also give two-way trade between the two countries a boost, adding totally new non-stop cargo capacity.
This literally marks a new departure for the loss-making SriLankan, which has terminated all long-haul flights including Paris and Frankfurt, apart from the daily flights to London Heathrow and Tokyo Narita. Adding Melbourne may not be enough to revive the fortunes of the flag carrier, now a member of the Oneworld Airline Alliance, but it will no doubt raise its profile globally.
SriLankan Airlines is obviously not in good health. SriLankan's operational losses widened to Rs. 28.14 billion (US$ 183.5 million) in 2016 from Rs. 12.62 billion (US$ 82 million) in 2015, but this has been attributed to the absorption of loss-making low-fare airline, Mihin Lanka, which was widely regarded as a vanity project of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The airlines operational losses for the first four months of 2017 are believed to hover around at Rs.9 billion (US$ 62 million). But financial losses are not the only aspect it has to worry about.
The previous Governments opaque deal for eight all-new Airbus A350 aircraft is likely to be included in a wider European corruption probe targeting Airbus, which could also severely dent the airlines reputation. The new Government cancelled part of the order by paying a penalty to the leasing company AerCap, but there are four more A350s on order. Efforts are now underway to cancel or renegotiate that as well. There is a school of thought that SriLankan should buy at least two of these new generation aircraft for Melbourne and other long-haul routes. The airline has however honoured a separate order for several Airbus A320 family NEO (New Engine Option) narrow-body aircraft, some of which have already been delivered and are in service.
According to latest reports, the Government will provide a credit lifeline of Rs.13 billion (US$ 86 million) through the two State banks to the struggling airline, which is still searching for the right international strategic partner after the unceremonious exit of Dubai-based Emirates several years ago. The US-based investment firm Texas Pacific Group (TPG) was in talks to acquire 49 percent of the carrier, but apparently pulled out after the true extent of the airline's debts was revealed. In August, a Japanese consortium of ANA (All Nippon Airways) and JAL (Japan Airlines, a fellow Oneworld airline) was reported to be interested in a potential deal, but no official information has been released so far. The authorities have been open to any other potential offers.
Finding a global strategic partner for SriLankan is essential, given that the Government cannot subsidise the airline forever. The Governments financial resources are much needed elsewhere and an entity such as SriLankan should be a viable, profitable, self-sustaining one. President Maithripala Sirisena, who was in Qatar on a Stat Visit, has urged the authorities there to explore the possibility of fellow Oneworld airline Qatar Airways becoming a partner of SriLankan, which they had agreed to consider. The President has also instructed the National Economic Commission to re-initiate a dialogue with two major international airlines vis--vis SriLankan. All efforts must be made to find a strategic partner for the airline.
In the meantime, SriLankan must innovate to survive in the harsh global aviation environment. In this sense, Melbourne is a step in the right direction. There is no denying that linking Melbourne to Colombo is an important milestone for the airline. The next step is to get Australian airlines, especially QANTAS, (a Oneworld alliance partner) to fly to Colombo as per bilateral air agreements, perhaps from Sydney. Decades ago, QANTAS did operate a Perth-Colombo-London service, which was discontinued in favour of Singapore as the transit point.
The Melbourne-Colombo route has great potential because Colombo is an ideal gateway to India and Maldives and a midway point to Europe for those flying from Australia. SriLankan can market itself as an ideal stopover point for the latter sector. SriLankan hopes to tap into the NRI (Non Resident Indian) traffic from Australia via Colombo. SriLankan already is the biggest foreign carrier operating into India with over 100 flights a week to 11 destinations, which gives it a great leverage to market the nascent Melbourne route.
SriLankan must be poised to exploit the burgeoning Asia-Pacific travel market, which is expected to reach 7.8 billion passengers annually by 2036, according to the International Air Transport Association. Routes to, from and within Asia-Pacific will see an extra 2.1 billion annual passengers by 2036, for an overall market size of 3.5 billion. China, India and Indonesia, all destinations covered by SriLankan, will account for the bulk of the new passengers. Australasia too will be a very important growing market and SriLankan is right on target.

How the Queen won $8million from horse racing
Queen Elizabeth II has won over 6.7 million ($8.8m) from horse racing prize money in the past three decades, new figures from the British Horse Racing Authority show.
The Queens thoroughbreds have chalked up 451 victories from 2,815 runs since 1988 when records became readily available, giving her a win percentage of 15.9 percent.
Last year was the monarchs most profitable in recent decades, with her horses earning 557,650 ($731,413).
And 2017 has proved a similarly good year, with 20 victories on the flat bringing in 413,641 ($542,531) so far.
All in all, it makes the 91-year-old the 11th most successful owner in flat racing in that thirty-year period.
Elizabeth II was given a Shetland pony aged four and has had a keen interest in horses from an early age.As the Queen grew older she became an accomplished rider, often attending official ceremonies on horseback.
She inherited several of her finest thoroughbreds following the death of her father, King George VI, in 1952.
And she was named British flat racing Champion Owner in 1954 and 1957.
With victories at the St. Leger Stakes, Epsom Oaks, 1,000 Guineas and 2,000 Guineas, the only one of the five British Classic Races that eludes her is the Epsom Derby.
The BHA Owners Championship -- awarded to the owner who has won the most prize-money on Britains turf and all-weather tracks throughout the season -- is currently topped by Godolphin, whose leading earner is Irish bay colt Ribchester.
The Queens best runner this season is Dartmouth, trained by Sir Michael Stoute.

If I am to be removed from party, so should Weerawansa  Piyasiri Wijenayake
National Freedom Front(NFF) National Organizer Piyasiri Wijenayake, who was criticized by fellow Party members for his criticism of Wimal Weerawansa over his statement on bombing the Parliament, said that if he was to be removed from his position or party, so should Wimal Weerawansa. A move, he said was seconded by the General Secretary of the Party.
I dont know if I was wrong to comment on what Wimal Weerawansa had said, he told the Daily News. I did not personally attack him or vilify him, but raised concerns over the salacious comments that Wimal had made, which I felt were detrimental.
Wijenayake added if he was to be removed from his position or the party, then Wimal Weerawansa too should also be dealt with the same card. I spoke to General Secretary Jayantha Samaraweera, who said that he had received a suggestion that I should be removed, but he had refused to sign it or address it with the media, adding that if I was to be dealt with in this manner, so should Wimal Weerawansa.
Wijenayake maintained that his statements were not a matter which ought to have been discussed with the Party head or its members before pronouncing them. He added that if it was so, Wimal Weerawansa too should have done the same.

JICA facilitates water for Anuradhapura
The Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) helps provide drinking water facilities to the Anuradhapura district in view of the fast spreading renal diseases in the district.
The JICA has agreed to support water supply schemes in the Anuradhapura North division where the drinking water problem and the number of kidney patients are high, Water Supply and Tragedian Board (NCP) Assistant General Manager said.
Accordingly, the JICA would facilitate Mega Water Supply project in the Anuradhapura Wahalkada reservoir.
Nearly 280,000 people in 147 Grama Niladhari divisions at Padaviya, Kebithigollewa, Horowpothana and Kahatagasdigiliya where around 10,000 kidney patients were detected will benefit from the project.
The Wahalkada tank would contain 43,000 a.f of water and additional water will be supplied from the Yan Oya reservoir.
The JICA has granted Rs. 30,931 million to complete the Wahlkada Water Supply Project. People in the area will receive 28,800 cm of water and 14,400 cm of purified water daily through a pipeline network.
The main pipeline runs 142 km and the total pipeline drainage system is about 1,000 km. The system includes a water storing main tank, 11 towers, four underground water tanks, and a modern water purification plant. The project will be complete within two years, sources said.

Kandy SCs first round matches
KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP
Defending league champions Kandy Sports Club who are under the watchful eyes of Mr. Rugby Malik Samarawickrema will come out for the first time on Saturday November 4. This time too thanks to the rugby committee headed by Lasantha Wijesuriya, they have a well balanced side, Sad to say their newly appointed skipper Gayan Weeraratne is a doubtful starter due to an injury. The first round fixtures are November 4th CH & FC in Colombo (venue still not known), November 11th v Police SC at Police Park, November 19th v Army SC at Nittawela, November 26th v Air Force SC at Nittawela, December 2nd v CR & FC at Longdon Place, December 10th v Navy SC at Nittawala, December 16th v Havelock SC at Havelock Park.
Kandy needs another well-equipped ground
Kandy could reign in sports only if another well-equipped ground is built. Sports is so popular in Kandy and developing fast that today there is an urgent need for another playground, especially for sports like cricket. Most of the Kandy schools that are without a playing field go out of town to play matches. Thanks, to the KMC they leased the Nittawela grounds to Kandy Sports Club which is now their rugby grounds at Nittawela. They make good money by hiring it for schools. The Bogambara Stadium was an asset for sports activities earlier when it was under the KMC. But today most of the clubs and schools are finding it difficult due to high ground fees and separate payments for marking lines using the pavilion, referee change room etc. for a playground which is not up to the required standards. Most of the schools and clubs heavily depend on this stadium for their sporting activities, except cricket. Pallekelle cricket stadium was built to promote cricket but today only international games, and big matches are played. Schools who cannot afford to pay the high cost have decided to come back to their old grounds and play.
Mahamaya, Trinity excel at Short Course Swimming
Mahamaya Girls College emerged overall winners at the Short Course Swimming meet which took place at the Hillwood College pool. Mahamaya Girls collected 259 points and Trinity College with 180 points were third in the boys.
Leslie, patron of KSC rugby academy
Leslie de Zoysa will be the patron of the Kandy SC rugby academy which will kick off from today October 28. Leslie who had his education at Vidyartha College, is a retired hotelier, he was first with the KRFC and later joined Kandy SC and earned a name. Patrons are generally non-members. This will be the 5th rugby academy in the hills, if it is conducted correctly it is going to be the education guide for talented young rugby players. Dozens of up and coming rugger players under the age of 16 are expected to attend the academy for an entry fee of Rs. 1750 and Rs. 2000 as academy fee for a month. Every entry will be given a T-shirt. It will be weekly affair (every Saturday, if Kandy SC has a match on Saturday then it will be on Sunday).
Emil to say good bye to KSC committee
Emil van der Poorten the famous ruggerite, who led Kandy Sports Club in the mid 1960s, keeps off from the KSC committee in the early days he was in the committee, vice president and secretary. This time he was invited by the present president to serve in the committee and he accepted that invitation on condition that the major shortcomings in the operation of the club be addressed, inclusive of the need for a complete revision of its Rules & Regulations. He is not happy with the irresponsible manner in which the clubs affairs are being conducted. He has said that he will not serve on the KSCs General Committee until and unless the commitments given are lived up to.
CPRFU development program
Central Province Rugby Football Union under the leadership of well-known rugby promoter Iswan Omar has come out with a rugby development program, which will take place today Saturday at Zahira College grounds at Gampola. Five top rugby coaches from CPRFU will teach rugby basics and other matters about the game. CPRFU has programmed this for six new schools from Gampola and Matale, they are Sarasavi Uyana MV, Nugawela Central , D.S. Senanayake MV, Ajmeera MV, Gampola Zahira College, Christ Church Matale, St. Thomas Matale, Vijayabahu MV, Matale, Vijaya MV Matale, these schools are expected to receive rugger balls courtesy of SLRFU. Rugby development officer Abdul Wahid Abdul Rasheed will be in charge of the organizing part.
Murali Stadium
Pallekele International Cricket also known as Muthiah Muralitharan International Cricket Stadium was declared opened on November 27, 2009 and became the 104th Test venue in the world. The first Test was played between Sri Lanka and the West Indies. The stadium is Sri Lankas eighth Test venue. In 2010 floodlights were installed. It was suggested years back to be named as Muthiah Muralitharan Stadium, in the name of the greatest bowler the country has produced. In July 2010, the Central Provincial Council unanimously made the renaming decision to hono ur the legendary Sri Lankan cricketer Muthiah Muralidaran. Now why is a Pradeshiya Sabha proposing it again, when it has been done years back. The stadium is wholly owned by Sri Lanka Cricket it is their duty to do the needful.
Sporting Principal Meetiyagoda says goodbye
After sixteen years of sports promotion at St Sylvesters College an institution which caters to children from every walk of life T.R.S.Meetiyagoda will say goodbye in the first week of next month. Under his principalship the school did well in all sports like cricket, football, hockey, athletics, rugby, boxing, basketball, table tennis, badminton, etc. He was a principal with limited facilities but gave a big hand for all sports. The school will miss him badly.
4th Kandy Rugby Academy tournament
The annual Kandy Rugby Academy tournament "Kandy Rugby 10's" will be held on the 9th and 10th of December 2017 for the 4th time at the Bogambara Stadium Kandy. More than 900 young players from rugby academies and schools will be seen in action, under the age categories of 8, 10, 12, 13, 14. 16, 18, 21 and Open.
The first "Kandy Rugby 10's" tournament was successfully held in 2015 with a great number of passionate and enthusiastic rugby players. All the well-wishers an expected to witness this great event and to show their support to make this tournament a grand success.
Kingswoodian Ronny with Airmen
Kingswoodian Ronny Ibrahim who coached Air Force earlier has taken over the post again, and for the last three months he has been handling the side. He is one of the experienced coaches and he polished his rugby through G. Gunadasa at senior level. He has experience in coaching for nearly 15 years. He first coached his school and he guided his cousin fly half Fazil Marija. He also coached Kingswood and later Air Force SC, Navy SC, Havelock SC and S. Thomas College.
Sylvesters prove themselves at cricket
Despite having limited facilities St. Sylvesters College Kandy has emerged as one of the top cricket playing schools in the central hills. They have a playground which can be used only for training sessions. Earlier the Police ground served as their venue for matches and they played all their matches, including the big match on that ground.
Today most of their games are played at Pallekelle Stadium. But they hardly get an opportunity to practice and warm-up on a centre wicket. Despite the lack of facilities the school has performed quite well. Out of three tournament matches against S. Thomas College, St. Josephs College and De Mazenod College ended in draws, and in the non-tournament games they drew with Joseph Vaz College and Kingswood College.
They were to play Dharmaraja College on 26th and 27th but the game was not played due to ground problems. Their next tournament game is with Lumbini College on 30th and 31st. Vice-captain N. Heshan Ataragalle a right arm pace bowler has done well taking 22 wickets in the matches played so far.

LG Polls Gazette out on Nov. 1
The gazette notification pertaining to the upcoming Local Government elections will be issued on November 1.
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha yesterday said the environment was now conducive to hold elections.
Addressing the media yesterday, he said: I would like to let the Elections Commission Chairman know that the pitch is now ready for the match (election),the Minister said, addressing the media yesterday at the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry.
Minister Mustapha said the President, Prime Minister and all political parties insisted that the elections be held as soon as possible and added that they are all working towards that goal.
The Minister assured that the elections would be held in January next year as previously planned.
The Zoning Plan of Ambagamuwa and Nuwara Eliya Pradeshiya Sabhas would also be issued parallel with the Gazette Notification pertaining to the holding of Local Government elections.
The Nuwara Eliya and Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabhas will be divided into six Pradeshiya Sabhas, increasing the number of Pradeshiya Sabhas in the Nuwara Eliya district by another four. The Minister will also submit a detailed report based on the geographical location and demographic composition of the above Pradheshiya sabhas to the Cabinet on November 31.
Minister Mustapha explaining about the zoning process said the existing wards in those areas would be divided among the Pradehiya Sabhas and added they would not once again conduct the delimitation of the wards.
Some think that this initiative would again become a reason for the delay in holding the elections. But neither the Ministry nor the government has any plans to delay the elections, the Minister added.
I have taken all possible measures to hold the elections as soon as possible. Now both the pitch and the ball is ready,Minister Mustapha said.

Liberal Democrats sweep Japan polls
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abes Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secured a two-thirds majority at the Parliamentary elections held last weekend. It won 283 seats out of 465 in the Lower House of Parliament. Its junior partner in the coalition, Komeito party won 29 seats. Opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) won 54 seats.
On September 28 Prime Minister Abe called a snap election to take advantage of the Oppositions disunity and the Korean missile crisis. The Opposition was fragmented. The main Opposition Party, the Democratic Party split into four. New parties formed on election eve had no time to consolidate, so that Abe surged ahead despite his popularity being low. It was the weakness of the Opposition rather than the popularity of the LDP that ensured the latters victory. It is also said that the electoral system favours the ruling party.
Election victory would consolidate Abes position as leader of the LDP. Analysts predict that he would become Japans longest-serving Prime Minister.
Despite the election victory Abe faces tough times ahead. Japans economy is riddled with a huge debt burden. Its national debt exceeds twice the Gross Domestic Product. Abe proposes to introduce a special consumption tax hike in 2019 for welfare funding which has generated considerable opposition from the public.
The election victory gives Abe a chance to push forward his pet policy of reforming the Japanese Constitution which is pacifist and bars Japan from becoming a military power. However, it would mean a challenge to the post-Second World War world order.
This could cause much division among the population whose anti-war sentiments remain strong with the memories of Hiroshima and Nagasaki still deep in their minds.
Al-Qaeda and ISIS move to Africa
With consequent defeats in Iraq and Syria al-Qaeda and the Islamic State ISIS have moved their centre of operations to the African continent.
A massive blast in Somalia's capital of Mogadishu on October 14 and it killed more than 350 and injured hundreds more. It was followed by more recent terror attacks in Somalia, Niger and Egypt highlight their presence in Africa. A large number of militants who joined the ISIS and al-Qaeda are from Tunisia and they are retreating to their homeland after the defeats in the Middle East.
This has led to increased involvement of United States, German and French militaries in the anti-terrorist operations in the continent. Governments in the poor nations are unable to handle the terrorist threat alone.
Political analysts point out that it is the social problems that have led youth to join militant groups. Among them are worsening economic conditions, especially poverty, underdevelopment and unemployment. Corruption and bad governance make the situation worse.
Hence, these countries need development assistance but the fight against terrorism undermines the development initiatives.
Venezuela: Government wins regional elections
The ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (UPSV) won the regional elections held on August 15 securing 17 of 23 Governorships. The Opposition Democratic Unity Round Table (MUD) won in 5 regions.
The USPV obtained 54 percent of the vote as against 43.3 percent it received in 2015. Out of the 18 million voters 61.14 percent took part in voting. MUD received only 45 percent of the votes cast. The United States which has called openly for the overthrow of the regime in Venezuela and imposed sanctions on it financed the Opposition campaign, in addition. It was hoping for an Opposition victory.
After the elections the Opposition and Western powers including the United States and Canada allege that it was fraudulent. In the meantime four of the five elected Opposition Governors have already taken oaths contrary to the decision of MUD to refrain from swearing in the post.
The Opposition now stands divided. Leader of the Justice Party Henrique Capriles Rodonski who unsuccessfully contested for Presidency in 2012 and 2013 has left the MUD over differences with the Democratic Action Party President.
Meanwhile, the National Electoral Council (CNE) accredited team of international observers hailing from different countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, the United States, Europe and Russia certified the the total reliability and transparency of the Venezuelan electoral system and noted that the voting process took place in total normalcy and in keeping with applicable legal, technical and organisational aspects. In addition, it saw the broad and organised participation of the Venezuelan people in a clear expression of their Popular Sovereignty.
Election results showed that the people of Venezuela have endorsed the new path of development introduced by President Chavez in the country. On the results of this regional election one could safely predict a victory for Chavismo at the forthcoming Municipal elections in December and in the Presidential election in a years time.

## Title: MAJOR THREATS ENDANGER CONSTITUTIONAL DEBATE
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Saturday, October 28, 2017 - 01:00
MAJOR THREATS ENDANGER CONSTITUTIONAL DEBATE
The debate on a new constitution is certainly gathering force, but regrettably it is largely a distorted debate due to deliberate efforts by those clearly opposed to a new constitution being adopted in the country, presenting the Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly, which is the Parliament, as the Draft Constitution.
What is taking place is a debate on unreality, deceit, duplicity and falsehood, taking the constitution making process to one of political mendacity; going against the mandate given by the people in January 2015 for a new constitution, remove the Executive Presidency and make Sri Lanka a more democratic state, with wider sharing of power.
This debate of duplicity is being transformed into a confrontation on religion and not on the substance of the State, and the formulations of State policy for the future. In a situation where instead of statecraft that should be the substance of the discussion, so-called religiosity is pushed forward with the use of the yellow robe, wholly distorting the thinking on constitutional reform. This comes with threats of mass protests led by sections of the Maha Sangha, clearly orchestrated by political forces that look towards racial and religious divides in the country, to support their goals of majoritarian politics.
The new surge of Sangha driven politics, against any new constitution, or constitutional reform, calling for the present Constitution to be kept unchanged, wholly ignores the call for constitutional change from 1978, showing a dangerous ignorance of history in the politics of post-independence Sri Lanka, especially after the rise of the Sinhala Only majoritarian politics in 1956.
Banda - Chelva Pact
It is necessary to recall it was large scale protests led by the Sangha that led to the tearing up of the Bandaranaike - Chelvanayakam Pact in 1958, intended to reduce communal disagreements, with a certain level of autonomy to the Tamil people. Prime Minister Bandaranaike, who was compelled to tear the pact, said he was doing it under pressure, and the consequences would be seen much later. He was not alive to see the full bloody consequences of this pro-Sinhala-Buddhist majoritarian pressure by politicians displaying the influence and power of the yellow robe.
It was not very long after, in March 1965, that Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake signed an agreement with S. J. V. Chelvanayakam  known as the Dudley - Chelva Pact - seeking to resolve some important matters affecting the Tamil speaking people. This too saw huge protest led by sections of the Sangha, and in the final clash with the police at Kollupitiya one young monk was killed; leading to Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake having to do away with the Pact.
The results of these mass protest movements largely led by sections of the Sangha and serving the interests of political opponents of the then governments were seen not too long after; when the country was thrown into a thirty year fight against separatist terrorism led by the LTTE. That battle ended in May 2009, but the conditions that caused the rise of separatist forces among the Tamil people, especially the Tamil youth, have still not been fully addressed and resolved. One aspect of the proposed new constitution, as seen in the Steering Committee Report, is to address the larger issue of national unity, and ensure that peace prevails among the different communities and religions in the country.
The present threats made by sections of the Sangha to take to the streets and prevent any change in the Constitution, is clearly seeking to push the country and its people back to the days of the majoritarian rejection of minority rights, and fair play in a democracy. This threatens the country once again of antagonistic living among the communities in the country, with its dangerous consequences, as history has shown us, both in Sri Lanka and abroad.
Against Buddhist thought
It is necessary to emphasize that this campaign by sections of the Sangha against constitutional reform or change, is wholly against the principles of Buddhist teaching, which gives the highest importance to understanding, tolerance and compassion.
The Steering Committee Report gives different proposals on the position and description of the State  as Unitary, as proposed by members of the Constituent Assembly, who are all members of this Parliament, as well as the public who made representations to the Committee. Similarly, there are alternate proposals about the status of Buddhism in this country. All of these remain proposals which can be well debated and accepted, or amended and rejected by the Constituent Assembly (Parliament) at the debate next week. None of these are dictums, precepts or any doctrines of faith. They are open to good discussion and debate, proper analysis, scrutiny and assay in keeping with the core principles of Buddhist teaching. In such a context, the campaign being manipulated with the participation of sections of the Sangha, to give a wholly wrong message about a Draft Constitution, or certain dangerous clauses in a supposedly new constitution, is one meant to mislead the people. It is something which no person committed to reason and rationality, such as a follower of Buddhist teaching, whether in yellow robes or not, should accept.
This calls for a strong response from the Government on its own position vis--vis the proposals in the Steering Committee Report, and on the very concept and principle of a New Constitution. One noticeable aspect of the current debate on constitutional reform is the very large absence of direct government involvement. The debate is largely the theatre of the opposition both to the government and constitutional change. The divisions within the ruling coalition  the UNP and SLFP, as well as divisions within the formal and non-formal SLFP, is certainly pushing the government largely into a role of silence, where the government should be the key player in the debate. Both the UNP and SLFP cannot forget, or seem to not know the clear mandate given by the people for a new constitution. Most notably, it was part of the main message given by the Common Candidate, Maithripala Sirisena, at the campaign for the Presidential Poll on January 2015. This was the clear position of the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, who led the civil society movement and wider campaign for the Common Candidate. The abolition of the Executive Presidency was a very clear part of this message.
As the debate on the Steering Committee Report approaches, the Prime Minister has been critical of what is seen as biased reporting by sections of the media, on the issue of constitutional reform and the Sangha. However, there is doubt in the public mind as to what the UNPs concept of the new constitution would be, other than its clear opposition to the Executive Presidency. On the other hand, there is the SLFP which for decades was to abolish the Executive Presidency, now wanting to retain it, and also opposing a new constitution. This position of the SLFP certainly requires a clear leadership position by the Party Leader, President Sirisena.
There is also the somewhat unexpected position by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is in support of abolishing the Executive Presidency, while opposing wider sharing of power among the people. This has much to do with the uncertainties of new political leadership.
What is clearly needed on this debate, to keep public support alive for a new constitution, is for President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe to take a joint stand on the issue, and make a declaration in support of a new constitution. This will help strengthen the peoples support throughout the country and also give a major push back to the racist and majoritarian forces, aligned with sections of the Sangha opposed to any constitutional change. Such unity by the leaders of the ruling coalition will help take this debate to the realization of public expectations that gave the mandate in January 2015.
The threats of violence
While sections of the Sangha are giving warnings of mass action against constitutional reform, there is a new danger of violence against those who support such changes in the structure of the State in Sri Lanka. The Members of Parliament, whether they support these changes or not, are all threatened by a bomb attack on Parliament, if a new constitution is adopted. This threat comes from none other than the leader of the National Freedom Front, Wimal Weerawansa, who thinks he should move beyond his farcical fasting to make a new mark in politics.
The other major threat comes from Major General Kamal Gunaratne, the author of Ranamaga Ossey - Nandikadal, and speaker at the pro-Gotabhaya Rajapaksa; Viyath Maga who says a new constitution would divide the country, those supporting it are traitors, who should be given death. There is also a description given how such dead should be carried insultingly low.
It remains a major question how the Buddhist campaign against constitutional change, can come together with such declarations of violence. It would seem that the campaign against new policies of the State is certainly displaying the threats that exist to democracy and peaceful loving people, amidst the political desperation of majoritarian racists.
While the Speaker will be attending to the threat announced by Wimal Weerawansa, the threat by Maj. Gen Kamal Gunaratne looks the stuff of criminality and legal action.

Multiple hats destroying Sri Lanka cricket!
There is no gain in repeating the fact that every citizen in this country is lamenting the plight
Sri Lanka Cricket has plunged at present. The success of our cricket and cricketers was the pride of this nation which each and every citizen in this country held dear in their hearts.
What is most worrying though is not the depths to which mismanagement by the current administration has decimated the game and our proud team, but the obvious inability of Minister of Sports to identify and introduce remedial measures. Appointing an Advisory committee to cover up the incompetence of the sitting administration reminds of the classic parallel to the famous adage of Caesar twiddling his thumbs while Rome was burning!!!
So, let us try and examine where exactly the fault lies and how grave the fault lines are. It is true that maladministration bears its share of blame. However, it is obviously not the only reason as SLC has been fraught with corruption and maladministration which has resulted in successive governments having to intervene and appoint Interim Committees. So, one can safely rule that out as the single most cause for the present crisis. Let us then turn our attention towards the Coaching and Support staff
We have a Head Coach who was originally hired as the fielding coach, and subsequently demoted to handle the junior under 19 squad as his skills and competency to hold that position was in doubt. Then we have a Batting coach who does not even possess coaching experience at school level. We have a Bowling coach who was parachuted into that position with little knowledge of the current circuit of bowlers, and then an abrasive Cricket Manager cum Selector whose credentials to hold these positions leaves much to be desired. One can therefore, safely apportion part of the blame to incompetent support staff structure.
However, nobody appears to be aware that the bane of our current problems lies with the critical area of selections. The selection blunders were all too obvious during the current series. What is most mind boggling is the discovery that the Chairman of Selectors was carrying out Match Refereeing duties for the ICC in Hong Kong while our team was been humiliated in a bilateral series with Pakistan. Although nothing that happens in this land of ours surprises anybody anymore, one can only wonder how the Minister of Sports can allow the Chairman of the national selection committee to hold another position which is in conflict with his current national duties Isnt the all important position of Chairman, Selection Committee being devalued That is not all, as things unfold it has also come to light that one individual is also the President of the Sri Lanka Cricket Players Associations. As the headline suggests one individual being permitted to wear such multiple hats which are in conflict with one another is causing structural damage to this game we all love. Shouldnt the Minister of Sports be removed forthwith for taking such ill informed decisions
How one individual can juggle with all these responsibilities without compromising on his obligations on each of its duties is worth scrutinizing. It is reflected in the decisions made especially with the T20 squad where the best players opted out from travelling for the third game in Lahore. Not picking the best team for the first two games to be played in the UAE is simply wrong and in breach of the Sports law and goes against national interest.
The Sports law in this country clearly stipulates that it is the duty of the national selection committee to select the best team to represent the country at any given time. This has clearly not happened in this instance, and is in violation of the Sports law. How the Minister of Sports can approve this team selection exposes his lack of knowledge of the laws and tantamount to inattention to duty. There can always be feeble attempts to justify this selection policy by placing the blame on the Ex-Co of SLC for having taken this decision citing provision in the constitution of SLC.
But, such deflections do not hold water, as the Sports law of the land supersedes all, and the Minster of Sports has failed miserably in discharging the duties vested in him as the head of sports in this country. The President of the Players Association too has failed miserably in upholding and protecting the interest and welfare of the players as duty bound in his capacity as President. More interestingly, another member of the selection committee holds the position of Joint Secretary of the Players Association. These revelations no doubt raises more eye brows if the appointment of these gentlemen to the National Selection Committee had sinister motives on deflecting objections from the players participating in a game in Lahore.
Judging by these facts, it is clear that this Minister of Sports and SLC administration has scant respect for the laws of the land and welfare of the cricketers and the game of cricket at large. It is also no secret that there are other individuals who hold multiple positions of President/Cricket Club, Player Manager, Commentator and Journalist and Office Bearer, Club President and Player Manager. It is easy for such individuals to wield their influence for personal gain at the expense of the pride of a nation. Until the Constitution of SLC and the sports law is amended bringing in clear demarcations of boundaries for each function within the cricket ecosystem the proud reputation of this nation will continue to be dragged through mud by selfish individuals for personal gain.
The ICC too better take serious note of what is unfolding in the International circuit and enforce provisions of their code of ethics to address the obvious fault lines. They simply cannot allow multi-functional individuals to destroy the integrity of this noble game. Unless they crack their whip and bring in necessary reform the entertainment value of the game will continue to decline. One sided encounters similar to what was witnessed during the recently concluded series turns away spectators and television viewership.
Alarm bells should hopefully be already ringing in the Headquarters of the ICC where Rugby Football has beaten Cricket to 4th position on Television revenue in spite of having a captive audience of 1.2 billion in India. These are dangerous cracks that holds potential to cause serious damage if left unattended.

New SLFP Co-organiser for Apura East
Electoral Organisers newly appointed by the SLFP are able to strengthen the party despite all types of criticism and allegations levelled at them, SLFP General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.He was addressing a meeting held to felicitate newly appointed SLFP Co-organiser for Anuradhapura East Electorate D. P. Bandulasena on October 24.
Several old organisers were removed because they were not performing well towards the party, he said.
Nearly 100 UNP supporters crossed over and received SLFP membership from Minister Dissanayake at the meeting.
Dissanayake said his late father Berty Premalal Dissanayake was unknown when he was appointed as the Anuradhapura Electoral Organiser in 1983.
But at the time of his death at the age of 59, he had risen to be a political stalwart in the region with a very large following. If party organisers failed to perform his duties by the party supporters and the people, They should be removed from their posts irrespective of their standing.
Todays party stalwarts have been able to climb up the ladder because they had been with the party at all times.
Dissanayake said the previous party leadership had promoted only their kith and kin without building a second and third tier leadership in the electorates.

The new Test league
How the new tournament involving nine countries will work
Test cricket will crown a world champion in 2021, after the ICC agreed to a new-look league involving nine countries.
The World Championship, scheduled to start with the 2019 Ashes, was given the green light at a board meeting in Auckland on Friday. England, Australia, India, Pakistan, West Indies, South Africa, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Bangladesh will play six series apiece  three home and three away  between the end of the 2019 World Cup and April 2021, with the final in June that year. The move is designed to provide international Test cricket with greater context as it combats the effects of a growing number of Twenty20 tournaments. Additionally, one-day internationals will be given a shot in the arm with a new 13-team league running from late 2020, providing direct qualification for the 2023 World Cup.
The big questions about the new Test cricket Championship is answered here:
WILL THE ASHES REMAIN IN ITS CURRENT FORMAT
Yes. England versus Australia will continue to be played over five Tests and will be factored into the two-year cycles.
But if an Ashes series is five matches, which ones will count
All of them  the ICC want every Test within a series to contribute to the league standing.
HOW WILL POINTS SCORING WORK
This is yet to be worked out. The model being worked on will see points awarded for both a series win and for individual matches. For example, if the total points for a series was 25, 10 might be for a series victory, with the remaining 15 points divided between the Tests.
SO WILL ALL TEST SERIES PLAYED IN THE PERIOD CONTRIBUTE TO THELEAGUE TABLE
Not necessarily. The six series for an individual team that contribute to the championship will be set out in the ICCs next future tours programme. However, countries remain free to schedule other Test series outside the league if they wish. England, for example, will begin their eighth series since January 1, 2016 when they walk out at the Gabba on November 23. If they play that many in future two-year periods, only six will be incorporated into the championship.
HOW WILL THE WINNERS BE DECIDED
The intention is for the top two teams to be pitched together in a one-off final every other June. While the ICC are not discounting the league leaders being automatic hosts, there is a strong appetite for Lords to be the neutral venue of the inaugural league. Those with good memories will recall that Lords was due to be the venue for the final in 2013, only for the previous Test Championship framework to collapse.
SO ARE FIVE-DAY TESTSHERE TO STAY, THEN
For now, although the ICC have provided scope for four-day Tests to be scheduled on an extended trial basis until the Championship begins.
These matches are likely to involve the three Test countries not included in the inaugural league  Ireland, Afghanistan and Zimbabwe.  Daily Mail

No U turns - PM
An outward looking economy, that is integrated with the global economy, is necessary to turn around the countrys debt ridden economy, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesingsaid yesterday.
He also cautioned that the future is bleak if this was not done fast.
The Premier, addressing the 32nd Sri Lanka Economic Association Annual Sessions, at the Center for Banking Studies auditorium in Rajagiriya, presented his views on what he thinks should be the focus in the coming years to uplift Sri Lankan economy.
While inviting the ideas and suggestions on what short term measures the Government can do to create employment and increase income of the people, the Premier pointed out that the Government has accepted the challenge to reach those targets mainly through the existing enterprises in Sri Lanka.
We have to reach those targets with many inefficient state owned enterprises.But some of them can be made efficient. But it will take some time.We are also tackling the question of inordinate bureaucratic delays, but some of these will bring results in the medium term and the long term. What do we do in the short term he questioned the audience while stating that the private sector should not be prevented from coming forward.
Stabilising the economy is not an option for us but a necessity and we have succeeded it. The Central Bank had a tough job in the last two years and it will not be any easier as our biggest loan repayments are coming in 2018 and 2019.We have the highest debt in the region and that is sucking up all resources of the Government.Expansion of non-trade activity and the drop in exports have contributed to worsen the situation, he noted.
The National Government is not the easiest form of Government, but nevertheless it gives certain stability despite the minor policy differences and frictions that are coming up. It gives us the opportunity of laying down a framework which will be followed thereafter.There will be no U turns, he added.
Wickremesinghe proposed that Sri Lanka needs to liberalise and open up the economy further in the short term while helping local industries to be more competitive and export oriented. Some in the domestic manufacturing sector are worried of liberalisation, but most of them have the potential to be competitive. While we think on the medium and long term, lets work now in the short term because that is where the results will come immediately, he remarked.
The Premier pointed out the capital market formulation in Sri Lanka and liberalisation of exports will make Sri Lanka the most open economy in South Asia.
Commenting on long term economic plans, Wickremesinghe highlighted the need to exploit the countrys strategic location in the middle of the Indian Ocean. If we can develop the Colombo, Trincomalee and Hambantota harbours, we will be the logistics centre of the Indian Ocean. Expansion of the Colombo harbour would mean that Sri Lanka will be the transhipment hub to India for the next 25 to 30 years. The best harbour in the Bay of Bengal is the Trincomalee harbour. There is potential for these two harbours to ensure closer economic cooperation between the five Southern States of India and Sri Lanka, said the Premier while stressing that future markets are going to be around the Indian Ocean.
Special Assignment Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Economic Affairs and Policy Planning Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva and Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy were among the many distinguished guests attended. The Asian Development Bank launched the book The Sri Lankan Economy: Charting a New Course at the occasion and the first copy was handed over to the Prime Minister.

Project to improve beauty culture sector
As a part of the Prime Ministers concept to uplift the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), a special project was initiated to improve the quality of the beauty culture sector - hairdressers and beauticians - around the country. The project is named as SED Salon.
The project is being implemented through the Small Enterprises Development Division of the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs which the Prime Minister is Minister, Policy Development Office of the Prime Ministers Office stated in a press release.
The Small Enterprises Development Division was formed in 1980s by the present Prime Minister while he was Minister of Youth Affairs and Employment with the objective of uplifting the SMEs with the assistance of the International Labor Organization. The project included programmes to promote customer attitudes, customer care, marketing and management skills etc. The main objective of this is to transform the beauty culture sector into a field of providing quality services to all, the release stated.
A total of 4,328 applications have already been received for this programme. The Sri Lanka Standard Institute has launched a series of awareness campaigns in July to maintain the standards of salons, and has already been implemented in all districts, with a large number of participants from Kalutara, Kegalle, Gampaha and Kurunegala districts.
Furthermore, action is being taken to provide an internationally recognized National Training Certificate (NVQ) for Beauticians and Hairdressers to provide an international recognition to their profession. The information and registration details of the project can be obtained from the Small Enterprises Development Division at each District Secretariat. As another phase of the project, it is expected to introduce a code of ethics for the beauty culture sector and to award the Merit Award for skilled beauticians annually. The first awards programme will be held in November 2017.

Public funds put to good use now - Justice Minister
The government has endeavoured to cut down state expenditure unlike the previous regime which wasted public money on personal aggrandisement, Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale said.
She also pointed out that both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are exemplary in creating a culture where politicians do not waste public money for their personal well-being.
She made these observations at a ceremony marking the commencement of concreting Kurudukolaniya road in Karawita.
Today you see both the President and the PM making official foreign visits the same way other regular people do. But when former President Mahinda Rajapaksa went for foreign tours, he paraded over 250 people with him and wasted public money that could have been invested in road development projects, Minister Athukorale said.
When former President Rajapaksas wife went to Paris for the Vesak Day celebrations in 2014, she used a hotel room which charged Rs. 25 million for just one night stay. Their sons also wasted so much of public money for car races. she furthered.
Minister Athukorale also pointed out that the present government has assured freedom of press and the independence of the judiciary system from which certain groups are trying to take wrongful advantages. Many people questions as to why certain legal actions are not taken against certain issues. We cannot just prioritise certain cases or influence the judiciary system to do so. she explained.
Minister Athukorale also pointed out that the present government does not do political favourations. There was a time when Samurdhi was given to people selectively. This approach has changed now. she said.
Rs. 13 million is allocated to the Kurudukolaniya road development project which is under the Pibidena Nivithigala program conducted by the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs.

Russian opposition newspaper to arm journalists
RUSSIA: Editors of Russias opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta said Thursday they were planning to give their employees weapons training and arm them with non-lethal weapons to protect themselves against possible attacks.
The decision comes amid a spike in violence against dissenters in Russia, including this weeks attack on a radio journalist who was stabbed in the neck at the offices of the liberal Echo of Moscow radio.
If the state is not ready to protect us, we will protect ourselves, Sergei Sokolov, a deputy editor at Russias top opposition newspaper, told AFP on Thursday.
When journalists find themselves helpless in the face of lawlessness on the streets and indiscipline of law enforcement agencies, there is no other way.
Novaya Gazeta editor Dmitry Muratov said on Wednesday that a number of employees would undergo arms training and the newspaper would purchase the weapons.
The use of firearms is tightly regulated in Russia. The so-called traumatic weapons such as arms that fire rubber bullets can be used for self-defence but can also inflict lethal damage.
I will arm the newsroom, Muratov said on Echo of Moscow radio.
We will also supply journalists with other security means that I dont want to talk about. We will conclude an official agreement with the Russian interior ministry, he added. I have no other choice.
Contacted by AFP, Muratov said he could not provide details of the plan over security concerns. Our security experts have asked me to refrain from commenting before we take concrete steps, he said.
Pavel Kanygin, a Novaya Gazeta correspondent, said he was ready to use non-lethal weapons to defend himself.
I dont see anything bad in our situation, he told AFP in written comments, adding that potential criminals may be deterred by the knowledge that Novaya Gazeta reporters carry weapons.
This too is defence.
President Vladimir Putins spokesman said Thursday he saw no reason to provide extra security for journalists.
Unfortunately, every one of us can become the target of a madman, Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding Novaya Gazeta was free to adopt any measures as long as they were in line with existing laws. Russian arms manufacturer Kalashnikov jumped at the opportunity to tout its guns, saying it was ready to offer a 10 percent discount to all journalists seeking to purchase non-lethal weapons.

Samaraweera batting coach of national team
Former Sri Lanka batsman Thilan Samaraweera is tipped to take over as the batting coach of the Sri Lanka team for next months tour of India.
Another former Sri Lanka cricketer Hashan Tillakaratne is currently the batting coach on the tour to UAE and Pakistan where the Sri Lanka team has had mixed fortunes winning the Test series 2-0 but losing the ODI series 5-0 and the first T20I of a three-match series on Thursday.
Much of Sri Lankas defeats in the one-day format have been due to poor batting performances which has seen them suffer 14 defeats in a row in fifty-over and T20 internationals since July this year.
Samaraweera a technically sound batsman and accumulator of over 5000 Test runs at an average of 48 was the batting consultant for the Bangladesh team until the Champions trophy in England in June this year.
Sri Lanka will play a series of three Tests, three ODIs and three T20Is during their tour to India.

Smart Identity Cards launched
The Department for Registration of Persons yesterday commenced the issuance of the international standard Smart Identity Cards including International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standard photograph of the recipient and a bar-code.
The first Smart Identity Card was offered to Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S.B.Navinna who participated as Chief Guest at the ceremony held at the Department of Registration of Persons.
Minister Navinna said all those above the age of 15 years who receive identity cards from yesterday onwards will get a Smart Identity Card. He also said that during a Presidents Mobile Service in Vavuniya, it was observed the difficulties that some people faced due to that fact that the identity card is printed at the office in Colombo.
Therefore, we decided to print the identity cards at Provincial level, Minister Navinna said.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe decided to provide these facilities by November in 2018,the Minister said.
The Minister said the details in the card are printed in the three languages.
He added that although it was planned to introduce this smart identity card on eight previous occasions but it did not come to fruition.But the Unity Government has been able to accomplish this task. He added that the Government has reduced the applicable age for an National Identity Card to 15 years.
Department of Registration of Persons Director General P.V.Gunathilake said the identity cards that have been issued until yesterday too are valid and no body needs to rush to get a new one. He added that the reprinting of 16 million Smart Identity Cards at an instant is not practical. He added those who are below 40 years of age would have to change their identity card due to the comparatively rapid changes they make in their outer appearances.
Gunathilake added that the Smart Identity Card is an interim card of the Electronic Identity Card which would be issued in due course, with the bio data of the recipient.
He also said they also plan to prepare a National Persons Registry which would include all the details of persons in the country.
He added that after the completion of the registration,the Department of Registration of Persons would take measures to send the Smart Identity Cards to all to their postal addresses in due course.
Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Ministry Secretary D.Swarnapala was also present.

Special Envoy Foreign Minister Marapana attends Royal cremation
As the Special Envoy of President Maithripala Sirisena who paid his personal respects on the passing away of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej in October last year, Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana, together with Madam Stella Marapana, attended the Royal Cremation ceremony held on October 26, 2017.
Minister Marapana and his spouse joined the elaborate and solemn occasion in Bangkok led by His Majesty King Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun and the Thai Royal family, together with forty-one other foreign dignitaries, including representation from some of the monarchies around the world and governments at the highest levels.
The ceremony began in the early hours of the morning with the Thai people lining the streets to pay their respects as the Royal procession conveying the remains of the Late King was ceremonially conducted to the Royal Crematorium. The formal cremation proceedings commenced in the late evening.
The Foreign Minister and spouse, together with other visiting foreign dignitaries, Senior Thai Government officials, members of the diplomatic corps laid Sandalwood flowers at the top of the crematorium, as a demonstration of respect to the late King. As the Special Envoy of President Sirisena, the Minister was also granted an audience with King Vajiralongkorn as well as the Royal Family, on conclusion of the cremation ceremony. On this occasion, Minister Marapana reiterated the condolences of President Sirisena and that of the Government and people of Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka and Thailand share a timeless partnership based on the bedrock of Theravada Buddhism. This relationship had been further strengthened during the reign of the late King. Of special note is the magnanimous gesture of the late King in extending the use of the Royal Rainmaking technology he had developed to alleviate a period of severe drought in Sri Lanka in 1980.
On the successful application of this technology in Sri Lanka, he had further allowed the training of Sri Lankan officials in its technicalities. Following this collaboration over three decades ago, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Thailand is presently coordinating between the Ministry of Power & Renewable Energy Sri Lanka and the Thai Royal Rainmaking Bureau & Agriculture Aviation, to initiate a renewed training programme for Sri Lankan officials in the new developments in this field achieved by the Thais.
This would assist Sri Lankas hydro power generation during drought months, as well as the agricultural crops which are heavily dependent on rain cycles. This is indeed an example of the benevolence of the Late King, who was also known as the Development King, to humanity.

Sri Lanka's attack survivors bring  top-level cricket back to Pakistan
Lahore: Tens of thousands of security will be deployed in Lahore on Sunday when Sri Lanka become the first major cricket team to visit Pakistan since they were targeted in a deadly ambush in 2009 -- with attack survivors among those returning to the scene.
Several Sri Lankan players and officials, including their head coach, have opted out of the Twenty20 fixture, after some voiced concern about security following ongoing militant attacks.
But Asanka Gurusinha and Hashan Tillakaratne, who came under gunfire in 2009 and are now Sri Lanka's team manager and batting coach, will be with the squad as it is shuttled in and out of Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium under heavy guard.
Pakistan's Ahsan Raza, a reserve umpire in 2009 who was among those shot -- and needed emergency surgery to repair a collapsed lung and damaged liver -- will also be on the field.
Eight people were killed and eight wounded in the March 3, 2009 attack on Sri Lanka's bus convoy near the Gaddafi Stadium, an incident which brought cricket tours to Pakistan screeching to a halt.
Eight years later, Sri Lanka will become the first top cricket nation to play in Pakistan since the incident, accelerating a gradual resumption of international fixtures as security improves.Sunday's game, the third and final Twenty20 -- with the other two played in UAE -- comes after Lahore also hosted this year's Pakistan Super League final and a one-off fixture between Pakistan and a World XI last month.
Raza was wounded when Pakistani Taliban militants targeted a bus carrying officials, killing the driver. Another bus's driver was hailed as a hero after shepherding the players to safety under a hail of bullets.
"It's a great honour that I will be umpiring in the match which is bringing Sri Lanka back to Lahore," he told AFP."They have set their every fear aside... their tour will have a great impact on the revival of cricket in Pakistan."
Sunday's Twenty20 international is being hailed as a brave decision by Sri Lanka and a milestone for Pakistan as it attempts to end its sporting isolation. AFP

Two Judges decline to take Bench
Two Supreme Court Judges among a three-judge-Bench yesterday declined to sit on the Bench regarding the fundamental rights petition filed by a senior manager of the Central Banks Public Debt Department who challenged the activities of several members of the Attorney Generals Department during interrogations pertaining to the Presidential Commission Inquiry into Treasury Bond issuance.
Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Priyantha Jayawardena declined to sit on the Bench regarding this Fundamental Rights petition citing personal reasons.
Justice Sisira de Abrew informed Court that respondents cited in the petition including the members of Attorney Generals Department and two Supreme Court judges sitting in Bond Commission were known to him.
However, Justice Vijith Malalgoda informed Court that he would do his professional obligation to hear the petition.
Meanwhile, Justice Sisira de Abrew assured that he would sit on the bench if there were no judges to hear the petition.
Accordingly, the petition was fixed for November 10.
Petitioner S.Pathumanapan, a senior manager of Public Debt Department has cited eight officers of the Attorney Generals Department, Central Bank Governor, CB Monetary Board members, the Chairman and the members of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquiry into the issuance of Treasury Bonds and several others, as respondents.
The petitioner stated that the treatment he suffered at the Attorney Generals Department during interrogations at the hands of Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera, ASG Yasantha Kodagoda and DSG Milinda Gunatilleke more specifically the threats, intimidation, duress, harassment, humiliating treatment and unlawful invasion of privacy to which the petitioner was subject amounted to cruel inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment.
The petitioner said that by failing to permit the petitioner to testify before the commission and seeking to intimidate, threaten, harass and otherwise penalise the petitioner for taking a position inconsistent with that which they have suggested to him, the members of Attorney Generals Department have subverted the purposes of the COI Act, deliberately prevented the truth from emerging and sought to deprive commissioners and the country as a whole of access to the facts and evidence of the petitioner.
The petitioner stated that he has not been given the opportunity to testify before the commission by the officers assisting the commission precisely because they are aware that he will be able to convince the commissioners of his bona fides and because his testimony would be unfavourable to them.
The petitioner further stated that he is being punished and victimized for refusing to provide favourable testimony to the officers assisting the commission. He said he reached the Attorney Generals Department at 3.00 pm on July 29, 2017 and he was taken to the chambers of Dappula de Livera.
The petitioner sought an Interim Order officers assisting Bond Commission (Attorney General Department) from taking any steps to require summon, compel the presence of the petitioner at any interrogation, consultation or other such meeting until the final determination of the petition.
The petitioner stated that the actions of the respondents amount to an infringement and imminent infringement of the rights of the petitioner recognised under and in terms of Article 11, 129(1), 13(1) and 14(1)(g) of the constitution. Presidents Counsel M.A. Sumanthiran under the instruction of Attorney-at-law Dinesh Vidanapathirana appeared for respondent.
Additional Solicitor General Farzana Jameel appeared for Attorney General.

The recent labour force participation survey carried out by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) shows that women in the rural and urban areas continue to lag behind men in the workforce.
Although women make up over 50 percent of the population and in education, many underlying issues pertaining to gender inequality in Sri Lanka have led to them not being able to increase their labour force participation.
The annual report of the survey released recently, showed that female unemployment rate remained the highest at seven percent with men doing much better at 2.9 percent. The overall unemployment rate stood at 4.4 percent in 2016.
In addition to the total unemployment rate, the highest number of 21.6 percent was reported from youths between the ages of 15 to 25.

USS Nimitz Group war ships dock here
The Nimitz Carrier Strike Group is scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka for a planned port visit today (October 28).
The Carrier Strike Group includes the USS Nimitz, the cruiser USS Princeton, and destroyers USS Howard, USS Shoup, USS Pinckney, and USS Kidd.
The ships are scheduled to depart Colombo on October 31.
Reflecting the growing relationship between the U.S. and Sri Lankan navies, this is the first time an aircraft carrier has visited Sri Lanka since 1985, and follows the recent completion of the inaugural bilateral Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) naval exercise.
Building our maritime partnership in step with Sri Lankas own progress on reconciliation and human rights advances our shared national goals of fostering security and stability, U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Atul Keshap said.
Im delighted that U.S. sailors will have the chance to visit Sri Lanka, meet with its wonderful people, and take part in public service activities at schools, hospitals, and rest homes that will improve the lives of Sri Lankans of all ages, he added.
It is estimated that the carrier strike group will add approximately 1.54 billion rupees ($10 million USD) to the Sri Lankan economy as the ships purchase supplies and thousands of U.S. sailors come ashore and support local businesses.
During the visit, sailors will have opportunities to explore the local community and meet with their counterparts in the Sri Lankan Navy.
While in port, sailors will also work with local non-profit organizations to support community service events at a local hospital, an orphanage, and other sites.
There is an excitement among the crew to experience everything Colombo has to offer, said Rear Admiral Gregory Harris, Commander, Carrier Strike Group 11.
There is a sense of adventure and anticipation for this visit since few in the crew have previously been to Sri Lanka.Our visit will be a great opportunity to enhance our relationship with Sri Lanka through cultural exchanges and other exchanges, relationships that I suspect will last long after we depart,Rear Admiral Harris said.
The USS Nimitz is more than 23 stories high from the keel to the top of the mast and is approximately 333 meters long. It can accommodate more than 5,000 personnel, with its kitchens providing more than 18,000 meals each day. It produces 1.5 million liters of fresh water daily and its two barber shops give 1,500 haircuts each week. The USS Nimitzs home port is in the state of Washington.

Pakistan wins second T20I and takes winning 2-0 lead
Ashraf destroys gallant Sri Lanka with hat-trick
ABU DHABI, Friday  It seems that nothing can go wrong for Pakistan at the moment for everything they touch seems to turn to gold as the saying goes.
Yesterday at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium Sri Lanka invited to bat first again by Pakistan in the second T20 International looked on course towards a competitive total when they raced to 106-1 by the 17th over, but when the Pakistani bowlers were not taking wickets they found other ways of doing so by running out three Lankan batsmen with some outstanding work on the field  two of the dismissals were off direct hits.
As it that was not enough Faheem Ashraf, a 23-year-old right-arm medium-paced all-rounder from Punjab became the first Pakistani and sixth bowler to perform the hat-trick in T20 Internationals.
In a sensational third over the 19th of the innings Faheem renowned for his big hitting dismissed Isuru Udana (caught) for 6, Mahela Udawatte (caught) for 0 and Dasun Shanaka (lbw) for 1 to end up with figures of 3 for 16.
Sri Lanka rocked by these run outs and hat-trick lost their last eight wickets for 18 runs off 22 balls to slump to 124-9 when a total in excess of 150 was on the cards at one time.
Although Sri Lanka fought back superbly to remove the top five batters for 94 in 16 overs and reduced them to 113-8 in the final over when 12 was required, Pakistan had plenty of depth in their batting to whisk off the remaining runs.
Shadab Khan (16 not out with 1 six, and 1 four) and Hasan Ali (3 not out) saw Pakistan home by two wickets with a ball to spare to take a winning 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
Sri Lanka on this occasion got their batting order right by promoting the big hitters Seekkuge Prasanna, Thisara Perera and Dasun Shanaka up the order, but they managed only five runs amongst them.
Sri Lanka needed to play fearless cricket if they were to get out of the present quandary of batting failures.
The top three in the order almost did that before the innings made a complete U turn.
Dilshan Munaweera and Danushka Gunathilaka put together an opening stand of 43 off 40 balls before Munaweera was run out for19 off a direct hit from mid-off attempting a quick single. He made it rather difficult for himself by running at an angle instead of straight. He should be told that the perpendicular is the shortest.
Gunathilaka joined by Sadeera Samaraweera showed positive intent and played the kind of cricket that had been lacking in the Lankan side for quite awhile. They ran their singles well and rotated the strike to raise a partnership of 63 off 64 balls before things started to fall apart.
Samarawickrama became the second run out victim when he was dismissed for 32 off 31 balls and in the same over Sri Lanka also lost Gunathilaka for a well compiled knock of 51 off 48 balls (4 fours, 1 six)  his maiden T20I fifty.
The quick dismissals of two set batsmen proved detrimental to the rest of the innings and the momentum of the Lankan batting was simply lost as Pakistan came roaring back into the game.
