Refrain from donating milk powder for infants
No milk powder or infants' milk powder should be given to flood victim infants or children in welfare camps. Only breast milk should be given to them, Consultant doctors attached to the Family Health Bureau of the Health Ministry said.
Health authorities in charge of relevant welfare camps will make arrangements for infants and children who lost their mothers due to the disaster, they added.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, Consultant Community Physician Dr. Hiranya Jayawickrama said no milk powder should be given to children because it can lead to serious health complications such as diarrhea etc. Sometimes such diseases can kill infants. The best milk for all infants and children is breast milk. In additional, children above the age of six months can be given complimentary food, they said.
Prof. Pujitha Wickramasinghe attached to the Department of Pediatrics of the Faculty of Medicine in the Colombo University said there is a myth that mothers do not have breast milk when they are under stress.
Mothers always have breast milk and they should feed infants and children. Mothers' nutritional needs should be fulfilled by giving them nutritious food, the professor said.
The Consultant doctors appealed to the public not to collect, donate or distribute milk powder for the use of flood victim infants and children in welfare camps. It is causing harm to their health. They can be physically and mentally healthy with breast milk given to them by their mothers. Infants bellow the age of six months should be given only breast milk. Other children can be given breast milk with complementary food, doctors said.

1.3 million children urgently need humanitarian assistance after storms batter Bay of Bengal

At least 1.3 million children are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance across the Bay of Bengal region following severe weather over the past six days, UNICEF has warned.
Devastation wrought by Cyclone Mora in Myanmar and Bangladesh, and torrential monsoon rains across Sri Lanka have left children homeless and in need of protection, nutrition and health services.
Children who have had their lives upended by brutal storms, severe flooding and landslides, are now threatened by a lack of safe drinking water, inadequate hygiene services and limited access to healthcare, said Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF Director of Emergency Programmes.
We must move quickly to ensure that services and supplies are in place to keep children safe and to stem the spread of communicable diseases like diarrhea, cholera or respiratory infections.
UNICEF is particularly concerned about children and families who were already displaced and living in precarious conditions before the bad weather struck  this includes some 74,000 Rohingya refugees who recently crossed into Bangladesh and were sheltering in an area badly affected by Cyclone Mora, and 120,000 displaced people in Myanmars Rakhine State.
The sad reality is these children have now been hit by double humanitarian crises, said Fontaine.
Displaced Rohingya children in Myanmar and Bangladesh, for example, were in many cases already struggling to access essential services even before the storm struck. Its imperative that we reach these vulnerable and marginalized groups  as well as those living in poor communities who will be far more susceptible to fallout from these storms  with the support they need.
The destruction caused by the storms in each of the three countries has been brutal. Initial reports from Myanmar indicate severe damage from Cyclone Mora to villages, schools and shelters accommodating displaced people in Rakhine and Chin states.
While in Bangladesh, Cyclone Mora has affected around 2.8 million people in vulnerable coastal districts. In Sri Lanka, flash floods and landslides from monsoon rains have so far affected more than 631,000 people, displacing at least 77,000.
UNICEF and its partners are ramping up efforts to provide children and families from all communities devastated by the storms in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar with lifesaving services and support, regardless of their ethnicity, religion and citizenship status.
This includes:
Bangladesh: pre-positioned supplies in heavily hit areas of Coxs Bazar and Chittagong, including hygiene kits, water purification tablets, plastic buckets, squatting plates and tarpaulins for approximately 11,000 people.
Myanmar: assessments to gather information on damages and needs in central and northern Rakhine and Chin states where landslides have disrupted major supply routes. UNICEF has pre-positioned plastic buckets, water purification tables, and tarpaulins and is working to provide supplies to get temporary learning spaces configured as the school year is just beginning.
Sri Lanka: distribution of 1,260 10-litre jerry cans, 1,000 tarpaulins and 100,000 water purification tablets to affected communities, and support for Government child protection efforts.

An Angry World..!
Today, what one sees is an angry world.
Its not anger directed at anything in particular, but one which attacks everything in range! Angry mothers shout at angry children, furious fathers rebuke same angry mothers, while same wrath filled children fist others their age with the same rage, as anger spreads all over.
Its become a disease, more contagious than cancer or heart attacks.
But where did all this anger originate from
Hey husband! smiles the First Lady as she looks at her blonde haired husband, Why you looking so grouchy today
I cant build that goddamn wall, to keep those Mexicans out!
You going to carry that surly look to your office
Yeah, let them see me like this!
TV channels throughout the country blur the face of their President as they find his look spoiling their morning shows and bringing down their ratings. Good morning America! says the morning TV host, today you will just hear your President and not see him, as we dont want to spoil your lovely day!
And for the first time, US television has blank screens.
But despite this, for many even the angry voice of their commander- in -chief translates into hate killings, racial abuses and slurs, and shootings, in a nation which was once the most tolerant country on earth.
And the same elsewhere.
In India, angry words from podiums and behind lecterns are turning a peace- loving people into gangs of cow vigilants, rapists and thugs. They roam the country inciting people, creating unrest and formulating huge cauldrons of anger.
Is it the heat asked a researcher on anger management.
Yes, heat emitting from the Prime Ministers office! said firefighters wiping the sweat from their brows. Weve been dousing the place with water, using the best of our equipment, but the fires coming from his office just cant be put off!
Look! shout the fireman staring with dismay at the map of the country, Fires are erupting everywhere!
Its all from the sparks of rage flying out from the leaders office! they cry and fire engines rush out of their bases to douse the anger and hate that the country is now so full of.
But the fires of anger only spring higher.
In a village somewhere in Tibet, high up in the Himalayas, a wise monk sat meditating. He was interrupted by shouts from others in his monastery as they pointed down to fires raging down in the valleys all over the rest of the world, Rage is erupting all over! shouted his fellow monks.
Till their leaders learn to speak in peace, think calmly and still the anger within them, their rage will spread and ignite others! said the wise monk, Till those very leaders learn calm, it will be an angry, hate filled world..!

Australia resist lure of fearsome foursome
London: Steve Smith said Australia were unlikely to field all their fearsome foursome of fast bowlers against New Zealand in their Champions Trophy opener against New Zealand on Friday.
Injuries have meant the quartet of Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and James Pattinson have rarely all been fit at the same time.
It appears Australia have decided its too much of a risk fielding all four in the same team, with John Hastings -- who has plenty of English county experience -- also in the squad.
I dont think well end up going with the four big quicks, Australia captain Smith told reporters at Edgbaston on Thursday.
Weve got a couple of options there as all-rounders.
(Marcus) Stoinis did very well in New Zealand in the last series, and Hastings has done very well for us over in these conditions.
Hes a little bit slower than the others and hits the seam and has some good skills throughout the middle as well.
For Cummins, whose career has been blighted by several back stress fractures, just being in contention again is something of a relief.
The 24-year-old made his international debut in 2011, yet the fact hes played just three Tests and 28 one-day internationals since then is testament to how much time Cummins has spent on the treatment table. But he now believes his body can withstand the rigours of international cricket.
I now feel that because Im a couple of years older, and because I had a full off-season at pretty low intensity, my body was a bit more hardened than it used to be when I did come back, Cummins explained. Left-arm fast bowler Starc, arguably the worlds leading yorker bowler, has recovered from a foot injury that cut short his tour of India, while Pattinson has returned from shin and back problems.
Australia boast one of the most powerful top orders in ODI cricket, with captain Smith and opener David Warner outstanding batsmen in all formats.
They could add extra firepower by including Chris Lynn, who shot to worldwide prominence earlier this year with a sensational Indian Premier League campaign, averaging nearly 50 for
the Kolkata Knight Riders. New Zealand beat Australia in a thrilling pool match in Auckland at the 2015 World Cup only to lose to their trans-Tasman rivals in the final in Melbourne. Fridays encounter at Birminghams Edgbaston ground is set to feature several survivors, with New Zealand captain Kane Williamson the star turn in a top order that also includes Martin Guptill.
Blackcaps pacemen Tim Southee and Trent Boult are proven performers in England, but Southee said: We know the conditions, but you cant rely on that.
New Zealand beat Australia 2-0 in a home ODI series earlier this year and Williamson said Thursday: We have played each other a lot, and we are fairly familiar with each other but teams are always trying to do (things) slightly different.
For us its trying to attack it as best we can. You come into these one-off clashes, they are very different, perhaps just being involved in a series.
This latest trans-Tasman clash takes place against the backdrop of a bitter pay dispute between Cricket Australia and their players.
We know that the ACA (Australian Cricketers Association) is handling everything back home, Smith said Thursday.
For us, our focus is on this tournament, and it needs to be because were coming up against some good opposition. Its a very cut-throat tournament.
You need to be switched on the whole time.
It was in Birmingham four years ago where Australias campaign at the last Champions Trophy foundered, on and off the field.
An Edgbaston defeat by England in their opening game was followed by Warner punching England batsman Joe Root in a Birmingham bar in the early hours of the next morning -- a clash that saw Australia suspend Warner from the opening two Tests of that years Ashes. AFP

Call of the Greenery
All of us are concerned about the Environment than older days as we know it is vital for us to have a safe life. For instance, all of us are facing global warming related issues at the moment. There are many real life stories about how environment damages created serious threats to human beings living in the world.
When we critically analyzed these stories the reasons for those was boiled down to the improper practices of humans. In other words, the responsibility to protect environment mainly lies with the human beings living in the world. Because of this very reason, green practices play a vital role to enhance the environmental protection.
In particular, these practices bring in a disciplined approach leading to implementing accepted norms with the intention of protecting and preserving the environment. Moreover, these practices have been introduced after a careful review of the environmental issues and to provide proactive solutions to protect the environment. Hence, Green Practices are becoming very popular and more and more people are keen to understand these practices and committed to protecting the environment in their professional as well as personal lives. The whole idea is to improve the quality of life of the people. Lets look at some of the Green practices for our understanding purposes.
Five RS
This is a very basic principle and can be used by anyone who is really keen to contribute to protecting the environment and the beauty of this concept is it can be used in a very practical manner and is a very effective one. The five Rs are Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Renew and Respect. These practices go a long way to support the protection of the environment. Lets look at these in a very brief manner.
Reduce
The idea of this concept is to contribute to the protection of the environment by reducing the consumption of every possible activity. For example you can reduce driving by limiting the use of car because sometimes we use our car to buy even a single item but if we can use an alternative approach we save our fuel contributing to protect the environment, reduce the consumption of energy as it has a rippling effect in their local community and worldwide, In other words reduce the use of electricity, reduce the use of cleaning supplies and likewise try to reduce every possible areas which has a contribution to environment.
Reuse
Look at the items that can be reused and as much as possible take steps to reuse those items. As a simple example is reuse your shopping bag without keeping a room to use multiple bags.
Recycle
This is another technique that we can use. Prepare a list of items that can be recycling, for example, laser printer cartridge, car battery, tires etc. and practice it.
Renew
Use as much as possible renewable resources. For example, if possible use solar power or wind generated power.
Respect
We need to always consider our environment and take every possible step to protect our environment by practicing the above concepts as much as possible. That helps to contribute to our society to develop a better environment paving the way to shrink your individual ecological footprint.
GREEN PRODUCTIVITY (GP)
This is also a concept that an organisation can use to protect environment whilst improving the productivity and business performance. It can be used by any type of organisation irrespective of their activities. Most of the organisations are concerned about the bottom-line of their organisation and GP support these organisations to reduce cost by helping to minimize wastages and to improve the product/service quality as both factors are strongly connected to overall profitability. The fundamental tools of GP are waste minimization, cleaner production, life cycle assessment and pollution prevention tools and use of those tools as part of the implementation of GP would result to savings providing a focused approach to protect the environment. In many situations, waste or pollution created due to inefficient manufacturing practices and those can be easily improved by practicing of GP tools. Productivity is a part and parcel of GP and therefore productivity improvements are taken into consideration when implementing GP. Moreover, the long -term perspective of GP is to have a better Environmental Management System incorporating the GP tools so that organisation has a strong foundation to improve environmental performance whilst improving the bottom-line.
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Considering the importance of environment and to provide a globally accepted suitable management system, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) established a Technical Committee  TC 207 to formulate international standards on Environmental Management Systems. As a result of this, TC 207 produced the worlds first set of international environmental management system (EMS) standards in the year 1996 and it was accepted by more than 100 nations and adopted this international standard as their national standard. Like other standards established by ISO, ISO 14000 is a voluntary standard and it covers the specifications in a generic manner to establish an EMS tailor-made to any organisation. In the ISO 14000 series of standards, many other important standards have also been introduced like environmental product labeling, Life- Cycle Assessment, Environmental auditing, and on Environmental performance tools.
In this series ISO 14001 is the standard that an organisation can use to develop its environmental management system. An environmental management system helps organisations identify, manage, monitor and control their environmental issues in a holistic manner. ISO 14001 is suitable for organisations of all types and sizes, be they private, not-for-profit or governmental. ISO 14001 standard requires that an organisation considers all environmental related issues connected to its operations, such as air pollution, water and sewage issues, waste management, soil contamination and, resource use and efficiency. Therefore, for any organisation which is committed to run its operations whilst protecting the environment the best model that they can use is ISO 14001 standard as it provides all the relevant requirements that an organisation should meet.
All ISO standards are reviewed and revised regularly to make sure they remain relevant to the marketplace. The changes also ensure that the standard is compatible with other management system standards. Based on this principle, ISO 14001 EMS standard had undergone revision in the year 2004 and now the standard was again revised and republished in the year 2015, considering the current activities taking place in the world to have a better environmental management system.
The most important change that the new standard focused was the greater Commitment from Leadership. This is very important as without the top management commitment and leadership it is not possible to have an effective environmental management system (EMS) as the support of Leadership is vital to sort out all matters related to EMS. Moreover, the commitment of Leadership is very much important as the Leadership can always measure and monitor the performance of the ISO 14001 EMS and its contribution to environment protection and accordingly can make further relevant recommendations.
Moreover, the EMS system should be aligned with the strategic direction of the organisation and it can only be done with the commitment of leadership only. Furthermore, a focus on life-cycle thinking to ensure consideration of environmental aspects from development to end-of-life is a new area of the revised version and it provides a platform to look into the complete cycle of the process in a proactive manner as a much broader concept and that makes the EMS system more effective and to provide the results to protect the environment. There are multiple benefits in compliance with the ISO 14001 standard, such as market advantages, financial benefits, and efficiency and performance benefits.
ASTM STANDARDS
Enabling green practices, ASTM International has published a series of standards (nine standards) covering the best practices to have Green meetings, events, trade shows and conferences.
Now it is easier to hold environmentally friendly meetings and other events because of this series of ASTM standards. Furthermore, this series of standards detailed the requirements for choosing the location for an event, environmental sustainability criteria for set-up and dismantling of trade shows and the exhibits that are built within the event floor, criteria for evaluating and selecting transportation and focuses primarily on the reduction of carbon emissions from transport-related activity arising from events, encompasses the range of audio visual and production services required to provide staging, decor, and scenic elements, audio, video, lighting, and technical production, focuses on communications and marketing and covers paper, printed materials, promotional items, signage, educational materials, surveys, exhibitor advertising leaflets, event guides, describes procedural requirements for the evaluation and selection of accommodations for environmentally sustainable meetings, events, trade shows, or conferences and covers specifying, selecting, and procuring, food, beverage, and non-consumable food- or beverage-related items, and waste management, energy, and water- related practices.
GREEN BUILDINGS
The LEED green building rating programme in the U.S. is a very famous one which provides guidance on environmentally responsible design/construction and therefore it can be used by all relevant parties in the construction industry such as architects, contractors, and facility managers. In Sri Lanka, Green Building Council provides this facility of Green Building rating taking into consideration of Sri Lankan context. Buildings can be rated for their environmentally sustainable construction.
The term green building apply not just to products, but to construction strategies, building design, and orientation, building design, building operations, maintenance and many more. Normally this type of programme covers the areas like sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection, indoor environment quality etc. Since these rating systems are based on international benchmarks the green building certification ensures that the building is sustainable.
Moreover, it is possible to calculate the individual impact that is the total set of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions caused directly and indirectly by an individual and that is called carbon footprint. There are many calculators available on the internet to calculate the carbon footprint. Once you can understand your carbon footprint it is possible to find ways and means to further reduce it. Out of many methods, some of those are the use of reusable bags when shopping, use of energy star appliances, plant trees, and much more we can do to make our environment -friendly.
It is our responsibility to make our environment green as it has a huge impact on our planet and that will provide a better platform for a future generation to live happily.

Citizens' Mail
For public attention
At present we are blessed with a powerful media, who highlight the problems faced by the public from time to time.
Sometimes it may be biased. Regrettably the Public Sector response is very poor. Private enterprises rush and clarify the position and also try to take corrective action due to fear of losing their marketability. Public enterprises do not pay any attention to media reports (News, Editorials, Letters to Editor etc.) mainly due to 
1) Domination maintained by them by way of powers. For example Electricity Board, Water Board issue red notices and curtail supplies despite the protest made by the consumer. Department of Inland Revenue freezes the Bank account if taxes are in arrears.
2) No loss of marketability, no competition.
3) Refuse to commit themselves as they fear that action may be taken if their reply is false. They wish to avoid problems instead of resolving them.
4) Lack of officials with public interest and also due to arrogance in some instances.
This situation should change now under the new Government. Every public department should have a public relation officer who should respond to the information furnished in the media and any complaints by the customers as well. At least, important Departments like Inland Revenue, Custom, Excise and Police should start this practice.
In Singapore, any letter sent to Government Department should be replied within four working days. In Sri Lanka no reply is received from Government Departments even after four months, but legal action is taken on time ignoring the protests made by consumers.
Hope this letter comes under the attentive eye of all concerned. World-wise Sri Lanka should become a Happy Nation ranking within the first 100 at least.
This is a step to achieve the target.

Cold shoulder to coal power
Reference is drawn to the article titled Coal power here to stay, who says otherwise: published in an English weekly on May 7.
In the subject article, the references to clean coal and Japanese Technology are very misleading. This could be due to ignorance or intention. Recently there have been reports of faked news. Therefore it becomes necessary to set the record straight, particularly in the interests of the consumer and decision makers.
The people of this country have an unquestionable right to affordable power. It is a crucial requirement for development  be it of individuals or of commercial activities. It is one of the roads to prosperity. Light is knowledge, knowledge is light is a highly regarded truism. Let there be affordable light for everybody for education, learning and industry.
Power consumers are paying for inefficiency, lethargy, incompetence, inflated power purchase prices, highly questionable tender awards and just plain robbery by parties with vested interests. This has got to be stopped. Consumers must protest against the shoddy treatment they are subjected to. The protests must be loud, strong and consistent.
It is mentioned in the subject article that according to the President of the CEBEU, the CEBs future vision for coal power plants is for clean coal plants utilising Japanese technology. It is interesting to note that later in the article he is reported to have correctly referred to these power plants as so-called clean coal power plants and not just clean coal plant. It defeats sane logic to promote large scale coal power. After spending billions of dollars on developing so- called clean coal technology, the world is abandoning coal power generation because of the massive pollution by carbon dioxide.
China, the leader in upgrading boiler technology spent billions of dollars and reached a peak of technology development, built not more than a dozen new plants and abandoned the program in favor of solar power and geothermal power. India too has abandoned coal power and diverted to solar power. Similarly the USA has diverted to solar power and natural gas power; Australia is diverting to solar power and geothermal power, while Europe too, with the exception of Poland, is abandoning coal in favor if wind and solar power. As queried before, what spurious logic is driving Sri Lanka to install more coal powered generation
There is nothing that can be truly called clean coal technology. It is a misnomer deliberately made up and used by coal interests on the attempts by governments in the recent past to clean up coal fired power generation by eliminating pollution, improving thermal efficiency and effecting carbon dioxide sequestration. Of these three branches of supposedly clean coal technology, only thermal efficiency improvement has been achieved. This only reduces carbon dioxide pollution by about 25%.
Coal is not cleaned of its impurities before burning; as such pollutants like SOx, NOx, heavy metal minerals and radionucliides are still there. It has been made mandatory to remove SOx, NOx and mercury and fine flue gas particulates, but most operators do not comply because of losses. China has required all coal - fired power plants to be retrofitted with emissions reduction technologies over the last six years. This is something Australia has studiously avoided doing. As a result, Australia has the most emissions intensive coal - fired power generation fleet in the world, behind even India. The third branch of Carbon dioxide sequestration is non-existent.
COAL MINING AND PREPARATION
Coal is dirty from the moment it is dug up. Mining destroys the environment. In some places such as in Applachia in the USA, whole mountain tops are just dynamited off to expose coal veins. The ecology of the whole mountain is destroyed. In other places with surface coal, huge pits are dug up; in these, massive coal mining machinery and dump trucks look like small ants in an ant hill. In still other places huge horizontal and vertical shafts are tunneled to mine underground coal seams. Excavations and coal-mixed backfill damage the environment. Exhausted and abandoned mines covered up by coal wastes and earthfill take generations to recover as shrubland. They are useless for agriculture. Until the cover-up, the mining areas are full of coal and dust pollution. Black Lung is still a fatal disease for coal workers.
The mined coal is washed prior to transport. This results in about 10%-20% as waste in the form of coal powder. That is directed with washwater into huge depressions in the ground. In one particular pit in Pennsylvania the amount of waste coal powder is 7 million tons. They, in hundreds of thousands all over the world, are all pits of serious pollution.
The washed coal is stored near the washing plant, in railway yards and shipping ports. At each point there is coal dust pollution on a massive scale considering that coal transport is in terms of several million tons annually. Handling at each such point and at delivery points and power plant coal yards create new coal dust  creating hazards in those areas too.
At coal fired power plants the coal yard could be several hundred acres in extent to permit thin stacking so as to reduce the danger of spontaneous fire as far as possible.
The coal is exposed to the sun and rain. Coal dust is produced and it is washed down by rain. In ten to fifteen years the run-off leaches into ground water. Coal contains traces of heavy metals which are toxic. We import and store over two million tons of coal annually. Over the long term as toxic material from coal dust and combustion residues collect in the ground and groundwater, the level of toxicity will exceed the levels safely tolerable by animals and plants. Animals here include humans. Sri Lanka will be certainly affected by this pollution. That is showing now.
Our country has a very limited land extent and too heavy a population density. We do not have land to waste  not even a hundred acres. Even now national parks, sanctuaries and animal habitats are being invaded and destroyed by humans.
USE OF COAL
Coal is burned to obtain heat and the heat is used to raise steam to drive turbines. Coal is not cleaned before burning. It is only pulverized to a particular size. There is no change in this practice so far in the so-called clean coal technology. To make it doubly clear, coal is used in a mere pulverized state in sub-critical boilers as in Norochcholai as well as in advanced ultra super-critical boilers as in China.
In burning coal, about 65% of its energy content is wasted as heat  until recently. Now, with advanced ultra supercritical boilers, this wastage has been cut to 45%. Even so, the waste is very high. In short, we are wasting roughly 50% of energy from a limited domestic resource. In the case of solar, we use only about 16%-20% but the resource is unlimited and external.
In solar power, the resource is eternal and unlimited. Waste is not a concern and is unavoidable.
COAL POWER GENERATION
Mention is made of introducing Japanese Technology in coal power generation. What is this technology The only new technologies applied in commercial scale to coal power generation is supercritical boiler technology and multi-stage turbine operation. The former was probably started in the USA a couple of decades ago but not seriously pursued there. Japan developed the technology to some extent but the greatest development has been in China.
In all boilers high heat is applied to convert water to steam at high pressure. This steam is used to drive turbine-generator sets. In the recent past boilers were operated below the supercritical temperature and pressure of water which are the conditions under which water as liquid is in equilibrium with water as steam and changes from one state to the other without gain or loss of heat. Such boilers are called sub-critical. The boilers at Norochcholai are sub-critical.
The thermal efficiency of a boiler is the percentage of heat energy that is converted to usable energy. For sub-critical boilers it is around 33% to 37% depending on age and usage.
Super-critical boilers have an efficiency of about 40% - 45%; ultra super-critical boilers have an efficiency of about 45% - 50% and advanced ultra supercritical boilers have an efficiency of 50% - 55%. Only the Chinese have built operating advanced ultra supercritical boilers.
This increase in efficiency only ensures better conversion of heat energy to usable energy; in other words a better use of coal, or in less use of coal to generate a given amount of energy. It has nothing to do with clean coal. The coal used is not cleaned; it is only pulverized as it has been used in sub-critical boilers. However, the reduced use of coal is said to reduce pollutant emissions by about 25% - which is a big plus point.
AFFORDABILITY OF NEW SUPERCRITICAL TECHNOLOGY
To ensure economic viability in supercritical technology, the boilers and the generators have to be huge. They have to be hung from an expensive steel framework as the only way to allow for their massive expansion at the high temperatures and pressures they are operated at. In addition, they have to be made of more expensive newly developed special alloys to withstand the operational conditions.
The generators too are huge. Based on efficiency considerations, the generators generally used are of 660 MW capacity. In these, the rotor alone weighs over 6,000 Tons. They have to be rotated at speeds of 3000 RPM to produce 50 Hz cycle current and at 3600 RPM for 60 Hz cycle current.
To rotate at least two such rotors at over 3000 revolutions per minute [RPM] a huge source of power is required  like a nuclear power station of over 1000 MW. That is another reason why this new boiler technology has to be applied in power plants of more than 1000 MW, apart from economics of scale.
In China advanced ultra supercritical technology has been applied at a cost of about US$ 600,000 per Mega Watt as reported by the senior engineer in charge of a project. Outside China this cost is estimated to double to about US$1,250,000 per Mega Watt. To work at least two generators each of 660 MW, the power plant capacity should be a minimum of 1,250 MW, costing a total of over US$ 1.5 Billion.
In fact, two Japanese companies are building a 2000 MW ultra-supercritical plant for a private Indonesian coal company at a reported cost of US$ 4 Billion. Because of the cost, each Japanese company is taking up only 30-35% equity and the Indonesian company is taking up the balance 35% through the supply of fuel. They have the support of non-recourse loans too. The coal company is already in trouble and may have to be bailed out by their government.
Can we afford such expenditure on coal power as promoted by the CBEEU Not at all likely.
In addition, and apart from the cost, in a country like ours with a comparatively low power demand and a matching small power supply system, it is not practical to have 1,000 MW power plants. The sudden loss of power from such a plant, for whatever reason, will mean a black out or a brown out for about 25% to 30% of our consumers. Such a power loss cannot be easily met as emergency supplies. That would require 500-1000 MW instantly, seamlessly available emergency capacity  capacity which would be normally idling.
Can we afford that too No!. It will be simply be a non-productive burden of expensive equipment and manpower.
Many coal producing countries are cutting down firmly on coal production and use. In the future coal prices will rise, definitely due to transport and manpower costs, if not for reducing supplies.
Then we will be burdened with a huge ever-rising recurrent expenditure, magnified more than now by corruption.
Therefore, considering all the negative factors connected to the use of coal for generation of power, why is it being so religiously promoted by the CEBEU when there are other much cheaper, much cleaner and more sustainable methods of power generation This gives a lot of food for thought, with high concern.
SOLAR POWER COSTS ARE SINKING!
Lazard is a Bermuda based global leader in financial advising and asset management. It is also in investment banking, asset management, and other financial services. According to their investigations and analyses, the levelized cost for solar power would be US Cents 6 per kWh by 2017. This has been beaten conclusively. Recent bid prices are given in Table 1
PANEL COSTS
Panel costs are coming down substantially. Chinese products are not the cheapest.
The second biggest installer and utility scale operator in the USA is planning to give fixed tilt solar power at less than US Cents 75 per Watt by 2020.
First Solar, the biggest panel manufacturer in the USA, will be under $1.00 per watt fully installed on a tracker in the western United States by 2017. They are producing panels for as little as 40 cents a watt, or about 15 percent less than Chinas biggest manufacturer Trina Solar Ltd. In 2019, First Solars module cost could be as low as 25 cents a watt, according to analysts models.
With the availability of cheap solar power generation components in price ranges of just a few hundreds of dollars, why hanker after coal powered plants costing billions of dollars
TECHNOLOGY
At present conventional commercial multi-crystalline polysilicon solar panels made by Solar City and Panasonic the highest efficiency rating of 22.5%. Thin film Cadmium Telluride panels made by First Solar have a highest efficiency of 22.1%. Further improvements will come, no doubt.
By end of next year, if tests for lifetime preservation of certain materials give positive trial results, the efficiency of all solar cells, installed and to be installed can be improved up to 32% to 45% by means of a simple operation. This will make a huge impact.
Within the next 5 years, the efficiency of panels alone could be improved to about 55% simply by making use of the invisible light and reflected light now wasted. In addition, the heat produced will be conducted away and stored  for power production at night. Several start-up companies are very confidently spending millions of dollars each on these developments.
In the face of all these improvements and price reductions, who would want coal power
If the answer then is that coal power generation will be required to maintain base load power, the solution is micronized coal power using low-sulphur coal.
Micronized coal, ground much finer than pulverized coal, can be easily separated from pollutants that contain sulphur, nitrogen, heavy metals and radioactive materials by a simple gravitational separation. It is then a true clean coal. As a result, flue gas desulphurization and removal of mercury will not be necessary. These plant being in the range of 50-100 MW, are easy on the finances and can be strategically located in relation to the grid. The effects of tripping of one or two units can be easily absorbed by the grid system without affecting consumers.
Alternatively solar power can be stored in batteries and released for peaking. Storage batteries are coming down in price. The Flow Battery could be an affordable solution.
COMPARISON: COAL AND SOLAR
1. Coal extraction takes up a lot of capital and other inputs. Sunlight comes free.
2. Coal power plants, even those of the latest technologies, emit a lot of pollution that imparts toxicity to the environment and affects the climate. Solar power plants do not emit any pollution; nor do they affect the environment or the climate.
3. Coal power plants are expensive to erect, expensive to operate and need long-term fuel stocks. Solar power plants are much cheaper, with virtually no operating costs or fuel inputs.
4. Coal power plant maintenance is occasionally very complex, expensive and loss-making. In solar power plants every part, be it panels, inverters etc can be monitored and problems easily detected on line. Parts or units are small, cheap and easily and quickly replaceable. No back-up power is required until repairs are done.
5. Coal power plants are necessarily large and unaffordable. They are not suitable for small countries too because a tripped plant can wipe out the power supply to 25% to 30% of consumer for several days. Solar power plants are affordable, can be built and extended as funds permit and contribute greatly to successful distribution of power.
6. With coal power we are wasting roughly 50% of energy from a limited domestic resource. In the case of solar, we use only about 16%-20% but the resource is unlimited and external.
7. Coal power generation produces massive quantities of gaseous and solid wastes which are harmful and not disposable. Solar power generation does not produce pollutants or residues.
From the foregoing, power consumers must be realize and keep in mind that solar power is about the cheapest, the safest, the most reliable and the most sustainable energy form available to us.
In a few years a very much more convenient method of power generation might become available. It will give steady base load power day and night. Tests have been going on for nearly two years to remove bugs in the generator. Till that is done successfully, power generated from solar energy remains the best option.

Dambulla Cave Temple, Galle Fort risk losing World Heritage Site status: Akila
The Dambulla cave temple and Galle Fort are at a risk of losing the World Heritage Site status, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
The minister made this revelation while addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday. He said the UNESCO has recently warned that the above two sites would have to be removed from the World Heritage Site list considering the deterioration of their conditions.
The negligence of the Archeological Department has contributed to this state of affairs. It has not taken adequate measures to conserve them during the previous reign. Now we have taken urgent measures to improve their conditions and conserve them.
We have also sought the help of international experts in this regard he said.
He said the law has not been implemented by the previous government for the illegal settlements in these heritage sites. Even in the East, the Department has failed to identify the archeological sites and mark their boundaries after the war ended. Now we are strictly implementing the law and no illegal settlements are allowed in reservation areas he said.
The Golden Temple of Dambulla (Len Viharaya) was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1991 and, the old town of Galle and its fortifications were inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1988.

Black coffee is a warm beverage as old as time, but black lattes Now thats a soul-quenching trend thats making our unicorn-exhausted souls do a double take.
Its not like we havent seen creative twists on the coffee drink before - unicorn and matcha lattes are just two of-the-moment varieties that come to mind. But while unicorn lattes are whimsical and covered in rainbows and mythical dust, and matcha offers an antioxidant-packed punch paired with supercool designs in the foam, the new obsession, goth lattes, are black as night - but just as Instagrammable.
Although goth lattes have been popping up on social media feeds primarily in the U.K. and Australia - such as Luxe Yoga - its only a matter of time before the unicorn-food trend will make a hard right in the U.S. and everything will get a bit, um, darker - literally and otherwise. As reported by BuzzFeed, the reason for the drinks black hue is activated charcoal, a superbuzzy ingredient in the beauty and wellness worlds at the moment, which reportedly has both detoxifying and purifying properties.
But while youre eagerly waiting to find the first shop nearby to Instagram taste-test the trendy new drink, you can try activated charcoal in a prepackaged sip, including the (also Insta-friendly) Dirty Lemon drinks.

Darshis film bags Fashion Film Award
The Summer Season of Colombo Fashion Week in March 2017 saw the introduction of a new annual initiative called Fashion Films. This brought together two creative streams of fashion and films; Five talented film directors worked with fashion designers to represent their inspiration and ideas on films shot on smart phones. The films were then entered into a competition.
Youre My Favorites (YMFs) film for Buddhi Batiks, which captured Darshi Keerthisenas ideation won the competition. The theme of her collection was based on A Chinese Love Story, the film was largely based on a poem of the designers choice about a love lost, YMF used this as a base for creating the visuals for the film.
YMF is a multi faceted creative agency working in photography, film, art, production, art direction and advertising run by sibling duo Ryan and Jonathan Wijeratne. Between the two of them are two artists not bound by any medium, photographers, filmmakers, an avid drawer, an actor and a chef and are now reinforced by the addition of Abhishek Gunaratnam, an associate creative, whos previous work lists famed establishments.
Speaking to Ryan on doing CFW Fashion Films he said Most of the time theres so much equipment to deal with, what was fun and challenging about this project was that all we could use was our phone. Its the first time weve shot something for work on a phone, in a way its easier to be creative and abstract and tell a visual story because you dont have to worry or think about what camera to use or what lense is right for the shot.
Youre My Favourite collaborated with Darshi Keerthisena for Buddhi Batiks, Sharmila Ruberu for Meraki, Charini Suriyage and Amilani Perera. Jason Rajasinghe collaborated with Ajai for Conscience and Jaish Jayesinghe for Jai, Adhil Ghouse collaborated with Dimuthu Sahabandu and U by Upeksha Hager and John Taylor with Catherine Rawson for The Old Railway to create the fashion films. The films were shown before each fashion designers segment. The directors collaborated with the designers to capture the designers ideas into a film. This was a new introduction to strengthen their presentation and an interesting collaboration of two creative fields.
Fashion has multiple levels of expression and film is one of the most important ones, CFW is an inclusive platform for related creative industries to collaborate and touch the creative process with different expressions. Hence these collaborations are healthy and constructive.In my quote include this at the end. I loved the work of all the film directors they created awesome work using a smartphone. Congratulations to all! There will be more in this space. Says Ajai V Singh, President and Founder of Colombo Fashion Week.
This year Colombo Fashion Week celebrated its 14th years since inception. A journey that started in 2003 has today revived the fashion design industry of Sri Lanka by impacting different aspect of the fashion design industry. 90% Sri Lankan designers that we see today are product of CFW system. CFW throughout the year works behind the scene on designer development program, fashion school programs, mentorship, retail development, fashion marketing and craft interaction.

Defender of human rights
Appathuray Vinayagamoorthy:
Appathuray Vinayagamoorthy, former Member of Parliament for Jaffna District, an attorney-at-law by profession, was born on December 19, 1933 at Sarasalai, an underdeveloped suburb of the Chavakachcheri Electorate. He passed away on May 28.
Vinayagamoorthy received his primary education at Sarasalai Vidhiyalayam. From there, he bourgeoned to Driberg College, Chavakachcheri where he completed his secondary education. He became a teacher for sometime at Hindu College, Sangathanai, Chavakachcheri.
Attainments
In around1953, he entered the Government Clerical Service under the Ministry of Justice and discharged his duties as an interpreter in several Courts in many parts of the island. During the period of his service under the Ministry of Justice, he obtained the LLB degree and enrolled as an attorney-at-law on October 18, 1985.
He commenced his legal practice under G. G. Ponnambalam (Jnr). He worked so assiduously that no force could stop his forward march with a significant leap into the field of human rights cases.
He would rush to the forefront to defend those who were incarcerated and languishing in detention or prison without recourse to legal remedy, incarcerated under the provisions of Emergency Regulations and/or the Prevention of Terrorism Act. He is a human rights activist. He has appeared in many hundreds of cases, defending human rights, and continued to do so even in the evening of his life.
He brought luster to the legal profession. He won the hearts of others by a touch of love and fully understanding the sufferings of others and not by the claws of terror or deceit.
Vinayagamoorthy was blessed with dynamic, unwavering and deep commitment to defend the underdogs. The case of Vinayagamoorthy vs The Army Commander and Others reported in (1997) 1 Sri. L. R. Page 113 would illustrate his burning desire to defend human rights.
One Vijayam Wimalenthiran was taken into custody by Army Officers on the October 2, 1993 at a lodge in Colombo. It was alleged that immediately upon his arrest, he was blindfolded. It was also alleged that he was detained blindfolded and interrogation too was carried out while he was blindfolded.
The investigators fetched an idea without any kind of credible information that Wimalenthiran was a member of a suicide squad, ordered by the LTTE to assassinate late President Ranasinghe Premadasa. The Army Officers had secured under the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, a purported confession from him to that effect. The authorities had failed to produce him in Court even after obtaining the alleged confession. He was so detained for more than four months without being produced in a Court.
Article 126 (2) of the Constitution empowers an attorney-at-law to make an application to the Supreme Court, appear and defend any person with regard to the allegation of violation of his fundamental rights by executive and/or administrative action. In this scenario, the human rights activist, Vinayagamoorthy filed on January 31, 1994 an application by way of Petition, verified by Affidavit with supporting Affidavits, alleging that the fundamental rights of the said Wimalenthiran under Articles 11, 13 (1), (2), 14 (1) (g) and (h) of the Constitution had been infringed by the Respondents, the Army Officers.
When Vinayagamoorthy supported the application, the Supreme Court referred the matter to the Human Rights Task Force (HRTF) for an inquiry and report. The Project Director of the HRTF reported inter-alia to the Supreme Court on March 24, 1994 as follows. With regard to the arrest and detention of the petitioner the Army Intelligence Unit has been unable to give a plausible explanation. The petitioner has been in detention for 142 days without being produced to a Court of Law. We were therefore obliged to direct the Secretary, Ministry of Defence to revoke the Detention Order and release the DETAINEE, Vimalendran from custody.
Vinayagamoorthy tirelessly pursued the application and the Supreme Court considered the report of the HRTF on March 29, 1994 and on that date the Respondents were represented by the State Counsel.
Thereupon, the Supreme Court made several directions to the HRTF and it was minuted to state that State Counsel undertakes to revoke the detention order and to release the petitioner if no indictment is sent to an appropriate High Court on or before 15.05.94; and in any event if such indictment is sent State Counsel undertakes that the respondents will revoke the detention order and release the petitioner if he is acquitted or discharged or if a suspended sentence is imposed on him in the High Court. In view of that undertaking Counsel for the petitioner (Vinayagamoorthy) does not wish to pursue this application even in respect of Article 11.
Noble Vinayagamoorthy
The above noble conduct of Vinagagamoorthy would certainly impel anyone to reminiscing over his lifestyle, thought, reflection and action. Though Vinayagamoorthy was so dedicated and efficient enough to make out a successful case for his client, he, as a man of ahimmsa, never manifested blood thirsty against his adversaries: never attempted to gloat over success by unfair means. His fragrance of service to the humanity would be remembered fondly forever even after his death. His death would not deter or eclipse his service rendered to humanity: glory to his humbleness.
The State failed to honour its undertaking. The State informed the Supreme Court that it was unable to carry out its undertaking as there were many suspects involved in the conspiracy to assassinate late President Ranasinghe Premadasa and they were at large and therefore, the investigation was not completed, rendering the Attorney General unable to forward the indictment against Vijayam Wimalenthiran.
Undeterred by these tedious and tiresome procedures, the relentless Vinayagamoorthy never failed to pursue his right to support the application for leave to proceed.
On July 28, 1994, the Supreme Court granted him to proceed with the application only in so far as it related to the alleged violation of Articles 13 (1) and (2) of the Constitution, to wit, Article 13 (1) states that no person shall be arrested except according to procedure established by law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for his arrest and Article 13 (2) states that every person held in custody, detained or deprived of personal liberty shall be brought before the judge of the nearest competent court according to procedure established by law, and shall not be further held in custody, detained or deprived of personal liberty except upon and in terms of the order of such judge made in accordance with procedure established by law.
RKW Goonesekera
To argue the main case, Vinayagamoorthy retained R. K. W. Goonesekere, popularly known as RKW. He is the teacher of all teachers of law, descended from Peradeniya University to Law College as Principal, and later appeared in many human rights cases and contributed essays on human rights.
The Supreme Court declared that Vijayam Wimalenthirans fundamental rights under Article 13 (1) and Article 13 (2) of the Constitution were violated by the 1ST, 2ND and 3RD Respondents (Army Officers) and ordered the State to pay Wimalenthiran a sum of Rs. 25,000 as compensation and a sum of Rs. 5,000 as costs. The Supreme Court held inter-alia that in order to prevent or minimize disappearances or abuses, it is of paramount importance that the requirements laid down by the regulations should be strictly observed. They were not intended for merely cosmetic purposes, but for the sake of fulfilling the basic obligation of the State to ensure the personal security and liberty of all persons.
He was always noble and he harmed none but was good to all. I conclude by quoting Shakespeare from Julius Caesar, with apology of little change of words:
His life is gentle, and the elements
So mixd in him, that Nature will stand up
And say to all the world, THIS IS A MAN.
C. V. Vivekananthan, Attorney-at-law

Do not return home by boat, Navy urges
The Navy urges flood-affected people currently staying at safer locations not to return to their homes by small boats or rafts arbitrary until flood waters recede.
Navy Media Spokesman Chaminda Walakuluge yesterday told the Daily News that three members of the same family including a14-year-old boy have drowned after a raft toppled near Ogaspe Temple in Aththudawa, Matara while they were going back to their inundated home.
He said the bodies of a father, 38, his wife, 30, and their son had been recovered by the Navy.
He added that the efforts taken to send flood-affected people to safer locations will be in vain if they do not stay in these locations patiently until flood waters recede. When floods recede, there will be a strong current which will drag things at a faster speed and boats travelling in receding flood water will be at risk, he added.

Do we comprehend status quo
Sri Lanka seems to be entrapped in a vortex of trouble, in a bundle of contradictions. Multiple crises confront it at present. Do we comprehend this status quo Or do we perceive them partially or in one dimension
Naturally attention is fixed at the moment to the deluge and the accompanying disasters. In the meantime the scourge of dengue and associated epidemic of AH1N1 influenza drops off the radar of public consciousness. Nor is the Highest Common Factor of both  environmental damage placed in its proper perspective.
To put it differently Sri Lanka is plagued with a major contradiction between nature and man as manifested in numerous phenomena such as floods, landslides, drought, contamination of ground water, soil and sea erosion, shifting of the water table etc. The much talked about man-elephant conflict is also a facet of the same contradiction. Disasters, both man-made and seemingly natural also stem from the same contradiction.
Waste management techniques
On the fertile ground of these contradictions grow socio-economic contradictions, which nevertheless take centre stage very often. Even they are eclipsed by the blowing up of minor contradictions in the political sphere caused by a ceaseless struggle for power between contending parties. That is why even in the aftermath of the present great deluge politicians seem to argue which of them faced such disasters more bravely or which managed crisis situations better. Forgotten is the fact that all these politicians are equally to be blamed even for the present disaster for the causes that gave rise to it did not arise overnight but were present for a long period.
Relief and rehabilitation measures are the immediate concerns of the government and the masses. It is rightly so. Yet our experience up to now seems to be that long-term and effective solutions to prevent the recurrence of such disasters were never taken up with the seriousness they deserve. Often even foreign aid that is received in instances of such disasters was not utilized productively. For example, there was large consignment of bicycles donated by China as flood relief to ease the transportation problems of the peasants affected by floods was un-utilized for years. It is also well known how tsunami relief went to private bank accounts of some political luminaries and how certain NGOs prospered with tsunami aid.
Flood protection technologies as well as waste management techniques are available in the world and if there was a will much could have been done by now. The late Dr. S A Wickremesinghe, Leader of the Communist Party has been campaigning for such multi-purpose projects to solve these problems from the 1940s onwards or even earlier. All he received was scorn in return.
Grandiose are the schemes politicians weave at times of disaster but few have moved from the realm of fantasy to the realm of reality. We could recall, for example, the proposal made in the aftermath of the tsunami to build a parallel railway track to the present coastline railway line.
It is not yet understood that only a holistic approach to the multiple crises we face and a united effort on the part of the Government and the civil society could free Sri Lanka from the critical situation that she is facing today.
Unfortunately all governments including the present seem to trust not such an approach and such unity for they have been relying more on bureaucratic and militaristic solutions. For example, the main plank of the dengue eradication programme is bringing heads of households with mosquito breeding grounds in their premises before Courts of law with the assistance of the security forces. Intrinsically this method has a confrontationist approach. How could such a method solicit public cooperation and understanding It is a method in which ownership is entirely in the hands of the State and not even a slightest degree of much touted public-private participation is visible there.
Environmental issue
What is required is mass mobilization on a voluntary basis followed by an educative mass information campaign. To do so the problem has to be understood not as a health issue but basically an environmental issue with a wide impact on health and many other spheres of human activity. Also all attempts at tackling the problem have been based on a top-down approach model with a Presidential Task Force at the Center. However, what is more productive would be a bottom-up approach starting at the village or city ward level and reaching the top at the level of a Presidential Task Force.
At present local government bodies and local government peoples representatives are not organically linked to the dengue eradication programme. At best they are bystanders in a programme conducted by the health authorities. Politicians who would at the drop of a hat gather hundreds of supporters for their party political shows never venture to mobilize the public for a clean environment programme, thus betraying their lack of political will.
Not only do they lack political will but also they are not sensitive to the sufferings of the people. That is why they go after luxury vehicles and other comforts which the ordinary masses could never dream of at huge costs to the public exchequer, even at times of calamity as the present.
The Government is reported to have temporarily, i.e. till the end of the year, suspended the import of vehicles for MPs and Ministers, perhaps with a view to deflate public pressure against it. However, the disasters could recur periodically and at best they would alternate with periods of vehicle imports for the politicians.
What is necessary is to grasp the depth of our problem. No amount of beautiful plans and aspirations could wipe off the reality that Sri Lanka is in a vortex of crises. Tough times necessitate tough decisions and it should be tough for everybody not just for the masses. Foreign aid that is basically earned by our expatriate workers and those in the plantation and productive sectors should be prudently spent. Extravagant festivals, even religious ones, should be curtailed, strict auditing and accounting should be undertaken. A moratorium of foreign debt payments for at least five years negotiated with the donors.
Politicians should stop the bickering over trivia and concentrate on nation building.

Elections Chief laments less youth participation in politics
There are no laws to hold by-elections when an incumbent politician dies, resigns or becomes ineligible to continue in office, Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said.
Addressing the "National Voters' Day 2017" event held at the Colombo University Law Faculty yesterday, he said measures are taken to strengthen the electoral system.
"But no where I see initiatives taken to hold by-elections. I have no idea whether there are proposals to include it in the proposed new Constitution," he said.
Deshapriya said the significance of celebrating National Voters Day is to encourage young voters to take part in the political process. He stressed the importance of youth participation in the electoral process.
"Universal franchise is a civic right. Sovereignty of the people certified by the Constitution could be exercised through franchise. It is mandatory to have the name in the electoral register to exercise franchise. It is a civic right and also a responsibility to insert names in the electoral register and to exercise franchise,"he said.
He said even though youth try to refrain from politics blaming the government and politicians for every action, they have to understand that some or the other way, everything is interconnected. Participation of responsible voters are required to form a good and a responsible government, he said.
Deshapriya said in India, there was a request to include 'None Of The Above" (NOTA) in the ballet papers to show their dislike for candidates. The public didn't want to cancel their votes but to express their displeasure. The Indian Supreme Court agreed to include NOTA in the ballet papers.
He said the topic is being discussed and added that he neither encourages nor discourages it.
"One of the questions from the youth is why we dont have it in Sri Lanka. But it has to come through the public and Parliament. It has to be legally accepted," he said.
He said responsible voting should be encouraged among the public especially the youth. He said there is less representation of the youth in Parliament and added that the youth are not interested in getting involved in political activities.
Deshapriya said it is important to elect most suitable and talented candidates.

Eshan becomes first Sri Lankan to win Rotax Max Asian Cship Race
Eshan Pieris winning Round 3 of the Rotax Max Asian Championship in Malaysia on Sunday created history. He is the first Sri Lankan to win a race in the most competitive Asian go karting championship and has succeeded in placing Sri Lanka on the international karting map.
Eshan showed exceptional driving skills to win against highly-experienced drivers and reigning champions from Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
An old boy of S. Thomas College, Mt. Lavinia and presently an undergraduate at the Monash University in Malaysia, Eshan represents the RL Karting Team from Malaysia.
Before the race and at the practices, it appeared that Indonesia's Senna Noor was the one to beat with Prassetyo Hardja also showing formidable pace. Then disaster over took both Eshan and Senna at the Time Trials, when technical issues meant neither turned a lap. This resulted in them starting the heats from second to last and last position respectively.
Brilliant driving in the heats then saw them both move up with Senna taking second place and Eshan coming in a close third.
In the Pre-finals, Eshan shot to the lead briefly but was soon overtaken by Senna Noor, in a Praga, who romped home to a victory with Eshan settling for 3 rd place behind a very quick Prassetyo.
The Finals started very well for Eshan and he soon passed Senna to take the lead which he held till the end.
Speaking about the race Eshan said, It was amazing to win the 3rd round of the Rotax Max Asian Championship. I came 18th after some issues in Qualifying but kept fighting in every subsequent race to finish in the top three and then eventually took the lead in the second lap of the finals.
I couldn't be happier with the support I got from my team RL Karting, my superstar mechanic Raj Raj and my manager and friend Aaron Lim all who worked super hard to get the best possible setup to ensure my success. Thank you to my parents and to all the people who contributed to my first ever international win. Now we push on to become the Asian Champion for 2017.
This win is even more commendable given that Eshan only started racing at the late age of 14 or so. Most go kart champions, who then go on to F1 careers, start at around the age of 6. His success was clearly the result of very hard work, focus, passion and dedication, especially as he is juggling a full racing calendar while pursuing his university education.
It was recently announced that an Asian X 30 Championship would be held at the Sri Lanka Karting Circuit in Bandaragama. This would be the first time an X30 race is being conducted outside of SE Asia.
Ability to host such as event that would showcase over 50 of Asias best karting talent and reigning champions would put Sri Lanka on the karting map internationally and also give young Sri Lankan motor enthusiasts the exposure to the highest level of karting. Hopefully Eshans success and the exposure to international races will be the start to Sri Lanka producing more go kart and potential F1 champions.
Next Eshan goes to France for a round of the Euro Championships after which he'll go to Singapore for the next round of the X30 SEA series.

They emphasised the importance of the rule of law and called for prompt action to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes were swiftly brought to justice. EU Ambassador Margue said: Sri Lankans know all too well the consequences of religious and ethnic hatred. These reprehensible actions are intended to sow discord at a time when national reconciliation and tolerance is moving forward. It is important that the Government and the Police ensure that there is no impunity for hate crimes. It is important that religious communities
are at the forefront of efforts to promote understanding and oppose the spreading of hate.

Exotic weddings, exotic locations
The monsoon breeze that blows through the country accompanied by pleasant weather during the month of May sets the perfect backdrop for a fairytale wedding. Blessed with an abundance of landscapes within a few hours of travel, Sri Lanka has become globally renowned as one of the top destinations for exotic weddings.
The fifth month of the year is traditionally considered the beginning of wedding season around the world and many brides (and grooms!) are determined to tie the knot in May.
The colonial architecture of the cottages and acres of lush green tea plantations kissed by the clouds make for an ideal location for an outdoor wedding. Royal Cocoon in Nuwara Eliya possesses just the right location, coupled with the ability to cater impeccable delights and unmatched hospitality ensures that the details of your perfect wedding are well taken care of.
Royal Cocoon situated in close proximity to the world famous botanical gardens in the hill country is a haven for those who wish to have an intimate gathering. The landscaped gardens can comfortably accommodate a crowd of 100. Any time of day is ideal for the ceremony as the temperature hardly reaches above 20 degrees, but locals will tell you that early morning or and afternoon tea-party is the best. In fact the tea party concept has become increasingly popular in recent times as it brings to life an authentic British garden wedding. The location presents you with sights of endless landscapes, valleys and hills existing in perfect harmony with the climate, vast water bodies and many more.

The government with Asian Development Bank assistance has initiated a feasibility study on the diversion of Mahaweli Water to Northern Province planned to be implemented with the completion of the Moragahakanda  Kalu ganga project, Mahaweli Development and Agriculture Ministry Secretary Udaya R. Seneviratne said.
The secretary said work on the Moragahakanda dam has been completed. Construction of the Kalu Ganga reservoir will be completed by the year end, he said. A massive development will take place in the Northern, North Central, Eastern and North Western provinces by taking water to those areas through the project, Seneviratne said. Twenty five megawatts of electricity will be generated, he said.
The government will also establish a new development zone of 85,000 hectares, he said.
According to the secretary, the Kaluganga and the Morakahakanda reservoirs will be linked by a tunnel. The Hurulu Wewa reservoir in the North Central Province will be linked by the Upper Elahera canal.

## Title: A fresh start

A fresh start
A couple of weeks have passed since a Cabinet reshuffle took place, but with the floods striking just a few days later, public attention was shifted from that event. The nine ministers who were given new portfolios barely had time to settle in before the devastating floods occurred and in line with the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes instructions visited their respective areas for flood relief work.
With the floodwaters receding and relief efforts well underway in all flood-affected districts, the focus is again shifting to political developments. In the latest such development, a reshuffle of a number of deputy and state ministers took place on Wednesday. Accordingly, four state ministers and four deputy ministers were sworn in before President Maithripala Sirisena.
This was a welcome move, because it was generally felt that some of the more deserving and skilled young leaders from both the SLFP and the UNP had not been given portfolios that were more in line with their knowledge and abilities. Despite this obvious anomaly, all of them served in the given portfolios with aplomb, even though they had to face a steep learning curve.
Dr. Harsha de Silva who is well known for his economic and business acumen earlier served as Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs under former Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, who is now the Finance and Media Minister. Dr. de Silva served in that post with distinction although diplomacy and foreign affairs was not his strong point. He learned the finer points as time went on, but it was obvious that his skills could have been better used elsewhere.
This seems to have been rectified with now his appointment as National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister. His Minister is, of course, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who has a vast experience in this sector and portfolio. Together, they will be able to iron out outstanding issues in this sector as Sri Lanka seeks national policies for health, education, transport, economy etc.
Former Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne who has been appointed as State Minister of Finance will be an invaluable member of Minister Samaraweeras team, which will also include Lasantha Alagiyawanna as Deputy Minister of Finance and Mass Media. Eran too could not realise his full potential in the previous role of Investment Promotion and Highways Deputy Minister.
Samaraweera, who is new to the subject and Wickremaratne, with his previous experience as Vice President of Citi Bank, CEO of National Development Bank (NDB) and Chairman of Information Communication Technology Agency will perfectly complement each other in their new roles. Minister Samaraweera is known as a fast learner and for his no-nonsense approach to any given portfolio. The trio has a very big challenge coming up in just five months  Budget 2018.
Wasantha Senanayakes appointment as State Minister of Foreign Affairs is another welcome change. As a great grandson of Sri Lankas first Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake, politics is very much in his blood. His Minister Ravi Karunanayake is also new to the subject, but this should not be a problem to the young Senanayake who is also known for his capacity to absorb new knowledge in a short period. Minister Karunanayake intends to shift the focus to commercial diplomacy and trade rather than HR and geopolitics and Senanayake will fit into this paradigm shift perfectly. Again, the pair is perfectly matched for the tasks ahead.
Palitha Range Bandaras appointment as State Minister of Irrigation does not come as a surprise and in Vijith Wijayamuni Zoysa, he has an affable and capable minister. This UNP-SLFP union demonstrates the very spirit of the National Unity Government. After all, the ultimate aim of both parties is developing the country and uplifting the public. Political divisions should not be a hindrance to that aim. Irrigation is very important subject given the primarily agricultural nature of our economy.
Former State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane will now function as State Minister of Public Enterprise Development. This is a huge challenge, given the state of some of our vital public enterprises. They have to be turned into viable and profit making institutions after suffering losses for years, if not decades. His minister Kabir Hashim is already doing a good job in this sector and coming from different parties (UNP and SLFP) they will have unique perspectives that can mutually benefit each other.
Ranjan Ramanayake who was given the additional post of Kandyan Heritage Deputy Minister will be working with Minister S.B. Dissanayake. This will be a productive relationship in more ways than one  they have almost similar personalities and are not afraid to call a spade a spade. Both have spoken against injustices in society on many occasions.
Karunaratne Paranawithana who was appointed as Vocational Training Deputy Minister will also have to work hard along with Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Chandima Weerakkody to develop this sector. They will have to find more avenues for thousands of children who are deprived of higher education every year. Indeed, the entire new-look Cabinet should broadly work with the future generation in mind.

Good relations paved inflow of international support: President Sirisena

President Maithripala Sirisena emphasized that Sri Lanka received international support during this adverse weather condition due to governments decision to maintain good relations with all nations.
He said this today at a meeting held by the Maldivian Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Mohamed Asim at the Presidents official residence.
At the meeting President Sirisena conveyed his gratitude to the Maldivian government and citizens for extending their support for flood relief in Sri Lanka.
In turn Maldivian Foreign Minister Mohamed Asim conveyed condolences of the Maldivian government and people towards the loss of lives and damages caused to the infrastructure of Sri Lanka by floods and landslides.
The Foreign Minister assured that Maldives will stand by Sri Lanka during adverse times as these.
Furthermore President Sirisena said that illicit dealings are underway between Sri Lanka and Maldives and that it could be eradicated only by joint efforts.
In response to this the Maldivian Minister said that his country will extend its fullest cooperation to immigration and law and order authorities in Sri Lanka.
Minister Dr. Mohamed Asim also briefed President Sirisena on the current development strategies of the Maldivian government.
Foreign Secretary Esala Weerakoon and High Commissioner of Maldives Zahiya Zareer also participated.

Government Backbenchers Group set up Students Disaster Relief Fund
A special fund has been set up by the Backbenchers Group in the Government to help the flood and landslide affected schoolchildren, UNP MP Prof. Ashu Marasinghe said.
Addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday, he requested all Parliamentarians to donate a months basic salary to the Students Disaster Relief Fund.
Account number 809123012 of the BOC Parliament branch has been opened for this purpose.
The fund is open to anybody who is willing to contribute. The money collected to this fund will be utilized to provide for the needs of the disaster affected children in a very transparent manner, he said.
To begin with we request all MPs to donate one months salary that amounts to Rs 54,285.
However, many have already expressed their willingness to donate more than that, he said.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said he has ordered a report on the schools affected by the recent disaster situation, adding that a decision on re-opening them would be taken following the receipt of this report on Friday.
He said as identified about 25,000 students have been affected, adding that all of them would be provided with a relief pack that includes uniform materials, text books and exercise books.
We will also provide a pair of shoes to them, but it will take more time as we have to follow the tender procedure, he said.
MP Prof. Marasinghe said in addition to providing for the needs of school children, they would also initiate student counseling to help disaster affected children to recover from the post disaster trauma. Moreover, the MP said the Backbenchers in the Government would also launch ground level campaign to raise public awareness on recycling of solid waste and Dengue control.

INSEE Ecocycle partners CEA, local  authorities in waste management
The total municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in the country is estimated at 6,500 metric tons (MT) per day.
INSEE Ecocycle, the waste management arm of INSEE Cement, has spearheaded a well-structured public-private partnership (PPP) for municipal solid waste management in co-processing 'segregated non-recyclable plastic, polythene waste from MSW' since 2014 in Gampaha and Kurunegala districts.
The partnership has demonstrated how the combined strengths of proactive private entities, the Central Environmental Authority (CEA), Office of the Commissioner of the Western Province and participating municipal councils can join forces with a private group to launch sustainable projects.
Prof. Lal Mervin Dharmasiri, CEA Chairman, said Ecocycle supported the national initiative of eradicating plastic, polythene waste and e-waste in Gampaha, Kurunegala and Puttalam districts together with the CEA in 2016. We appreciate the support extended by them to CEA."
Sanjeewa Chulakumara, General Manager of INSEE Ecocycle, said We are very happy to partner in solving the national issue via public-private partnership. It is a very successful showcase when we look back after five years of all our efforts. Chandrani Samarakoon, Provincial Commissioner of the Western Province said, "Having understood the systematic and professional processes of INSEE Ecocycle, local government department carried out a series of joint awareness sessions together with the support of INSEE Cement, in order to ensure waste segregation at local authority level, which became a reality.
Director of Waste Management Authority (WMA) Nalin Mannaperuma said, WMA gives utmost importance in inculcating the mindset and establishing the Polluter Pay Principle amongst all sectors. Persuading someone to pay for his or her own waste is a challenge as we have the option of free dumping or burning. We appreciate INSEE Ecocycle for stepping forward to establish waste management practices for the corporates.

Interesting, but challenging
The Dynamism of the Methodist girls can be directly linked to their wonderful insight into drama. Dramatic Moves features the girls of Methodist College, whose positive attitudes have taken them a long way as thespians.
Teacher in charge, Amanda Van Eyck, is the proud teacher in charge of these girls who has seen them mature into talented ladies.
Specifically we dont have a drama society, it is called the English Literary and Dramatic Association. We like to focus on Original Theatre and also look at current issues. It may be a comedy or tragedy but we prefer to engage in current issues. Sometimes we do take part in Shakespeare but it is not a focus again because as I said before we prefer Original Theater.
But we do like to take part in the Royal College Interact Drama Competition so since you can do whatever you like it suits our style, said Van Eyck
Every year the school has the Inter-House Drama Competition which is in all three languages.
We get the girls to write original scripts. By doing this is forces them to be more creative and think more deeply about issues. So that creates a base of ideas and talent. Then when we take part in a competition and do a production it helps. Our principals have been very supportive, stated Van Eyck
Working with the girls can be challenging at times, because it is a very informal setting she confesses.
But it is also very interesting and everyone gets quite close at the end of the process. It is also rewarding to see them taking on responsibilities and when they manage things on their own.
I feel that having the support of parents is very important because practices can be very time consuming and parents are sometimes not willing for children to cut their classes. Sometimes finding a director who fits our style is challenging, she added.
______________________________
The easy roles
President, Dulmani Atapattu credits their success to the school that acts as the wind beneath their wings.
From primary onwards we have gotten the opportunity to expand our horizons and be involved in theatre. And at Methodist College we have a lot of talent. We have so many upcoming actresses and people who have been doing drama for a really long time at school. I am really glad and I appreciate the fact that our school has given us this opportunity to be involved and showcase our talents. This year we took part in the Drama Comp. and we were the winners. So that has been an amazing opportunity. We have really taken it in and enjoyed the experience, said Atapattu
As the President you need to be able to hold everyone together and make sure everything runs smoothly and manage everything.
I think Unity and Cooperation is one of the main strengths we have. If we have to get something done and even though the time period is short and there is a deadline we meet it somehow. We all coordinate really well together and we listen to each others ideas. So that is one of our main strengths. That has basically helped us proceed and progress over the years, stated Atapattu
When it comes to the work ethic the girls are very punctual and practice thoroughly.
So if we practice for two hours we will give it 100 percent and do a strenuous session and cover the entire area we want to do. We have our goals pertaining to what scene we want to cover and we somehow meet that goal and that is the beauty of it, added Atapattu
Relying on each other helps them enact roles.
For this years production the role I played was personally close to me. Her qualities and characteristics was associated with my own character. How she deals with things, her attitudes and how she holds herself.
This was one of the easy roles I have done and I could relate to it. So I thoroughly researched. So we, the cast, actually get together, talk to one another, share our opinions and get a rough idea of what the play is about. Inwardly we build it in ourselves. That really helps us get into character and understand it, explains Atapattu
She feels the younger ones can take on the challenge after the seniors have left.
They also have the opportunity to take part in inter-house drama competitions, so through that they gain more exposure. We have workshops now and then to prepare the younger ones. They are really enthusiastic about it and they are ready to do it. There are a lot of stepping stones that Methodist College provides, pointed out Atapattu
Drama has helped me in my character building, personality wise. The lessons you learnt and the mistakes you made have really helped in life. All experiences gathered together really helps you as a person. You learn so many things and drama is like my passion. I would never trade anything in the world for what I have received from drama.
______________________________
An opportunity for everyone
Secretary, Sanjeeda Shibly felt they have a diverse armory of talent.
Our girls have a wide range of strengths. But what I like about our society is that it is not specific to one talent. So you can act and manage things backstage, so there is an opportunity for everyone with their own unique aptitude. So we have a wide range of all those aptitudes. Everyone puts in the same amount of effort and everyone is equal. And from that you learn a lot. Drama is a bit more special than any other extracurricular activity.
As a person you need to connect with everybody. You are opening your subconscious to a whole other level, said Shibly
______________________________
Discovering yourself
Former committee member, Miriam Alphonsus said that doing drama is a self-discovery process.
In my memory the most memorable production to me would be the one we did in 2015 called Fruitcake. The part that was most outstanding/memorable about it was that it really involved the student actors. Even in acting and in how you develop your character, the play involved a lot of the students participation. You really felt you were involved in the play itself. It becomes a part of you and you have to give a part of yourself to the play to make it work, said Alphonsus
The passion that these girls have for drama is very obvious
We have been giving drama a really big priority, and we were very passionate about it so we did whatever we could to bring it forwards and make it a huge part of our school career. If Drama is your thing it can contribute a lot to your personality. It makes you more honest. When you are doing drama you have to take on another role.
After you have taken on four or five roles you discover in each of those roles that there is a part of that role that connects with you. It is a self -discovery process. If you take on challenging roles it pushes you to understand and think deeply about emotions and personalities you wouldnt normally consider, and then you realize you also have similar feelings. It really helps in the process of discovering yourself and allows you to be honest with yourself, explained Alphonsus.
______________________________
A lot of work
Treasurer, Pomodya Weerasinghe feels the competition at inter-house is at a high standard.
The intensity of the Inter-House competition at Methodist varies every year and everyone wants to win the overall championship, so there is a lot of competition. But when it comes to the finals it is pretty intense. The issues we tackle are intense real life issues.
Stepping into the skin of another character takes a lot of work. When I see my fellow cast members in action it is like switch is turned on and I can picture myself. It is easy because the cast works together and no one really plays the fool. When we have to get something done we all do it together, said Weerasinghe.
______________________________
A milestone
Former committee member, Ruqaiyah Kamil certainly plays it by ear.
In 2014 we won Drama Comp. and the play we did, involved a lot of risks, because we addressed issues that were very sensitive and stuff.
And that developed into Fruitcake. I feel that over the years drama at Methodist College has been consistent. 2014 was a milestone even though we have been pretty consistent over the years before then. Since then we have been taking drama more seriously.
I have this trigger to switch on and switch off when I am in character. I listen to a song that makes me feel the way the character feels. And I get into character. The younger generation at Methodist has so much potential to do amazing things, said Kamil.
______________________________
An ensemble performance
Former committee member, Dinuki Panditharatne, too like the others has benefited immensely from drama.
When we won in 2014 we got a lot of attention. Our principal thought it was a really good play and the cast even acted it out in Assembly. Even though I did not take part in Fruitcake I really enjoyed watching the play develop. Drama helps you to be more understanding. I think it teaches you to be more open, while doing drama you explore so many characters, said Panditharatne
The girls agreed that in Fruitcake, they dealt with issues that were really personal, and they had each other to fall back on. They girls agreed that when it comes to drama at Methodist, it is definitely an ensemble performance, and even if it is just one minor role the actress would put in so much effort like the main characters. Character wise it is extremely balanced so no one particularly stands out. Again maybe part of it is because of their style dealing with social issues, that forces everyone to be part of the process. That is why it automatically becomes an ensemble types.

Its a girl! Venus lets Serena baby secret slip
Paris,Wednesday: Serena Williams will be the mother of a baby girl, if sister Venus is to be believed after she appeared to let the secret slip on Wednesday.
Venus, playing at the French Open in Paris, told a TV interviewer: Shes going to call me her favourite aunt.
We all like baby V, baby Lyn, baby Isha. We all want the baby to be named after us, the 36-year-old told Eurosport, referring to the names of Serenas sisters.
Serena, who revealed she was pregnant in April, has refused to discuss the sex of the baby she is expecting with fiance, Alex Ohanian, the founder of Reddit.
She was at Roland Garros on Wednesday watching her older sister defeat Kurumi Nara in the second round on the showpiece Philippe Chatrier court.
I think its not easy for her to watch, because, you know, obviously she knows she can do well here, said Venus after the match.
Serena is a three-time champion at Roland Garros.
I think that shes just excited about everything coming up in her life, on and off the court, excited about returning here hopefully next year, added Venus, who turns 37 next month.
Serena, who won her 23rd Grand Slam title in January when she defeated Venus in the Australian Open final, is due to give birth in September, the month she turns 36.
Earlier this week in Paris, Venus had talked about her anticipation of becoming an aunt.
Im definitely looking forward to it. I have no idea what the experience will be like, because previously I became an aunt when I was very young and lived far away, across the country, so it was a completely different experience than it will be this time, she said.
So I hope that I can live up to this job. Ive got to get some confidence that I can do this. Its all new for me. Its a great journey.
Venus, who was runner-up to her sister in Paris back in 2002, added: I think you just have to be ready, aware, and alert. Then have a lot of diaper duty. Yeah. So well see.
Serena learned she was pregnant just two days before the Australian Open.
She has told of being nervous about playing, uncertain whether it would be too dangerous for her or the baby.
Kelly Bush Novak, Williamss publicist, said last month that the US star looks forward to returning in 2018. AFP

JO MPs meet EU envoy to canvass for LG polls
A group of Joint Opposition MPs led by MP Dinesh Gunawardena met EU Ambassador in Sri Lanka Tung-La Margue to discuss the delay in holding the Local Government (LG) Elections yesterday.
The JO handed over a statement to the EU Ambassador on the failure of Government to hold LG Elections during this meeting.
The JO in its statement said the fundamental democratic rights of the people have been violated due to the Governments refusal to hold the LG elections over the last two years.
The public has been denied of representation at the most basic, grass-roots level which impacts most on their day-to- day life, health and welfare.
The revenues collected by these local government bodies are being used unproductively.
The public servants in charge of these institutions are helpless, since they lack direction from duly elected councils. The result has been the breakdown of services.
The collection of garbage or waste is not carried out systematically and the hygiene of the citizens is in danger.
JO MPs Namal Rajapaksa and Prasanna Ranatunga also took part in the meeting.

Marble your pout!
Ready to deck up your pout with a wee bit of marble Well, if youve been following beauty closely, the Marble lips trend shouldnt come as a surprise. For the uninitiated, heres everything you need to know about the unconventional and quirky trend.
Marble lips are in vogue, owing to its super intricate style. However, that shouldnt stop wide-eyed make-up enthusiasts from giving it a shot. Marble lips is a look, which screams DRAMA! and demands precision. Wear it at a fun girls nightout to jazz up your look.
To begin with, you will require a few different lip shades, a tiny liner brush, and a steady hand for drawing strokes of colours. Start with a solid base like a white. You may even opt for turquoise blue, and then use a thinner brush to add swirls and flecks of the second and third colour (colours like grey and black are best suggested) and create a marble pattern. Finish off with a layer of clear gloss, and voila! Your countertop lip art is complete. This lipstick trend gives you the freedom to experiment with different colours and vibrant hues. You can simply combine shades of white, grey and black, or opt for vibrant hues like blue and purple and even incorporate strokes of gold or silver!
Lip art demands maintenance. So, by that we mean, do not skip the routine scrubbing and moisturising. Its important to exfoliate enough for the best results.

Murray, Del Potro set up French Open blockbuster
Paris: World number one Andy Murray set up a French Open blockbuster against Juan Martin del Potro on Thursday, the latest chapter in what has developed into an epic rivalry.
Murray, the 2016 runner-up, reached the third round with a bruising 6-7 (3/7), 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7/3) win over Martin Klizan of Slovakia.
Del Potro, playing in Paris for the first time in five years, went through to the last 32 after Nicolas Almagro retired in tears with a knee injury.
The giant Argentine was immediately hailed for his sportsmanship when he embraced the sobbing, stricken Spaniard. Out on Suzanne Lenglen court, world number 50 Klizan smashed 57 winners but 67 unforced errors as his all-or-nothing game proved in vain against top seed Murray.
"I expected a tough match. Martin goes for his shots, he can hit winners with that forehand from anywhere on the court," said Murray. The Scot beat Del Potro in a marathon Olympic final in 2016 before Del Potro, now 30 in the world, gained his revenge with a come-from-behind win in five sets in the Davis Cup semi-final.
"It will be very tough. Juan Martin is playing a lot better than his ranking," said Murray as he looked ahead to Saturday's clash.
Del Potro, no stranger to injury after a career-long battle with wrist problems, made the third round after Spanish opponent Almagro quit in tears during the third set with a left knee injury.
In a moving conclusion on Court Two, Del Potro sat next to a sobbing Almagro, offering him water while trying to to console the heartbroken 31-year-old.
Del Potro had also gone to the Spaniard's aid when he had collapsed at the back of the court, weeping, just moments earlier.
"I tried to find good words for him at that moment. I say to him, try to be calm. Try to think about his family, his baby," said Del Potro.
"Sometimes the heart is first more than the tennis match."
Del Potro, 28, had taken the first set 6-3 before Almagro claimed the next by the same score.
They were locked at 1-1 in the third when Almagro quit.
Del Potro also suffered an injury scare himself when he pulled up, holding his left groin in the second set. Third seed Stan Wawrinka, the 2015 champion, reached the last 32 for the 10th time with a 6-4, 7-6 (7/5), 7-5 win over Alexandr Dolgopolov of Ukraine.
Wawrinka will face Italy's Fabio Fognini for a place in the fourth round.
Japanese eighth seed Kei Nishikori routed France's Jeremy Chardy 6-3, 6-0, 7-6 (7/5) and set up a rare all-Asian clash with South Korean Hyeon Chung.
Chung, the 21-year-old world number 67, followed up his first round win over US 27th seed Sam Querrey with a 6-1, 7-5, 6-1 victory against Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan.
Nick Kyrgios's Australian Open ended in a 5-7, 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 loss to big-serving Kevin Anderson of South Africa.
Anderson, ranked at 56 in the world, made the most of the 18th-seeded Australian's 42 unforced errors to progress to the third round where he will face Britain's Kyle Edmund.
Unseeded 21-year-old Karen Khachanov of Russia continued his impressive debut, beating Czech 13th seed Tomas Berdych, a semi-finalist seven years ago, 7-5, 6-4, 6-4.
In the women's event, crowd favourite Eugenie Bouchard's struggles continued with a 6-3, 6-0 loss to Latvian 17th seed Anastasija Sevastova.
Czech second seed Karolina Pliskova and third-seeded Simona Halep of Romania, both firm women's title favourites after the first round exit of world number one Angelique Kerber, look for places in the last 32. Pliskova has never got beyond the second round in six previous attempts. The 25-year-old Czech faces Russian world 86 Ekaterian Alexandrova who has never beaten a top five rival.
Halep, the 2014 runner-up, faces German world number 102 Tatjana Maria who is bidding to make the third round for the first time. Fifth seed Elina Svitolina, a quarter-finalist in 2015 and recent Rome champion, made the third round by beating Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, seeded nine, saw off Belgian qualifier Alison Van Uytvanck 6-7 (3/7), 6-2, 6-3. AFP

Navratilova says Margaret Court is a racist and a homophobe
Eighteen-time Grand Slam champion Martina Navratilova has renewed her call for the Margaret Court Arena to be renamed - describing the Australian as a "racist and a homophobe".
Court, 74, has said she would not fly on Qantas "where possible" in protest at its support of same-sex marriage. She then told a Christian radio station "tennis is full of lesbians". In an open letter, Navratilova said: "We should not be celebrating this kind of behaviour."
The 60-year-old addressed her letter to the Margaret Court Arena, one of the main show courts at the Australian Open.
She said: "It is now clear exactly who Court is: an amazing tennis player, and a racist and a homophobe. "Her vitriol is not just an opinion. She is actively trying to keep LGBT people from getting equal rights (note to Court: we are human beings, too)." In 1990, Court said Navratilova was a poor role model for young tennis players because of her homosexuality. Navratilova said she had forgiven Court for those comments, but had only just been made aware of remarks the Australian made about South Africa's apartheid regime.
Court, who won 24 Grand Slam singles titles, said in 1970: "South Africa has the racial situation rather better organised than anyone else, certainly much better than the United States."
Navratilova described Court's actions as "bullying" and said sporting venues are named after athletes for "who they are as human beings" and "not just for what this person did on the field". - BBC

NDBs Uva Sabaragamuwa region along with the NDB Ampara branch as one of the Banks CSR activities, recently stepped into support the community through a walk against Environment Pollution and Dengue.
The event saw a participation of over 400 representatives from NDB Ampara Branch and Uva Sabaragamuwa region, MOH, environment circles, schools, environment committees, government offices, religious institutions, Police Department etc.
The motive of this walk was to educate the public on environment pollution and its connection towards the spread of Dengue. Participants distributed leaflets and created public awareness during the walk. The program concluded with a seminar carried out with the support of the MOH at the Municipal Council Auditorium Ampara.
The Bank also opened five sign boards on environment conservation at significant locations in Ampara in order to obtain constant attention of the community in the area. NDB also donated mosquito nets to the Director Health of the region, to be distributed amongst hospitals in the area and eco-friendly bags were circulated amongst the participants.
Supporting NDBs initiative, Dr. Rasika Hasantha, Coordinator of the Ampara District Environment Committee said, I am grateful that NDB has taken steps to work hand in hand with the community of Ampara for this grave cause. With the evolving technology, people have started to focus less on their environment and have made polythene and plastic a way of life.
 As a result these non-degradable materials harm the air we breathe, the water we drink and the soil we live on. This pollution has become a main cause for deadly diseases such as dengue and can cereven amongst children. Our future generation will be deprived of a cleaner world to live in if we do not take action immediately. As humans, we must all work together and make every effort to stand against polluting nature.
NDB remains dedicated to guide its customers to success whilst being committed to support them accomplish their life long ambitions and uplift their standards of living through the range of services that is accessible through its growing branch network.

Already US$ 2 million has been promised as grants to Sri Lanka, he said. He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Head Office in Colombo.
However foreign countries suggested that if an emergency situation was declared they could provide us more funds but the President decided not to declare so as some groups will create a different image using the same situation.
He said that the government has decided to ask for generators, water motors and gully browsers and boats which could be useful in the future. He said that the existing boats seemed useless as they were unable to use in the powerful currents of the flood waters.

One third of Lankans suffer from or prone to diabetes
One third of Sri Lankans (30 to 35 percent of the total population) suffer from diabetes or are prone to developing diabetes.
The percentage suffering from hypertension is 30 to 35 percent, Consultant Physician attached to the National Hospital Dr. Priyankara Jayawardena said.
Addressing a media seminar at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said only around 20 or 25 percent of the people who suffer from diabetes and hypertension know that they have the issue while others live without knowing their health condition. When the two health conditions are combined, it often leads to strokes, he said.
Prof. Pujitha Wickramasinghe attached to the Department of Pediatrics of the Faculty of Medicine in the Colombo University said 10 to 15 urban children are overweight and three to four percent of the urban children are obese. The excessive intake of sugar in various forms leads to these two conditions.
Most parts of their necks (around the neck) become dark which is one of the first signs of developing Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes etc. Zero calorie beverages have the risk of developing strokes, dementia etc. People become addicted to sugar and it can be prevented by not introducing sugar to them from the point of conceiving a child. Then they do not crave for sugar, he said.

Operationalising SDGs to mitigate future disaster risks
As we face yet another disaster, the need to focus on sustainable development becomes more important than ever. It is in this area that Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) comes into play and must be made an integral part of social and economic development. In 2015 the government signed on to adopt the UNs 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), some of these are directly linked to DRR. They are: Goal 11; to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, Goal 13;take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, and Goal 15; to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.
These are important Goals to remember when we asses our activities in post disaster recovery situations. The SLWPs work in Aranayake in the aftermath of the landslide in 2016 will highlight how the principles of DRR are being applied to bring back a community after a natural disaster.
The Sri Lanka Water Partnership has organised and supported the Ma Oya Area Water Partnership from its inception and the local partner of the upper Ma Oya area in Aranayake is the Ma Oya-Kuda Oya SurakeemeVyaparaya (MKSV). It has also carried out a major activity supported by Janashakthi PLC in Aranayake which included water quality surveys, support for nurseries run by community women, reforestation of significant catchments and river banks and areas as well as construction of Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) systems in Rahala West School and Hemmatagama hospital. These RWH systems are continuously monitored and are functioning well and serving the community in the current drought. This activity was organised by SLWP with support of its Partner NetWwater (NWW) which has also supervised and constructed 26 RWH systems for hospitals (supported by Retourschip Foundation, NL) and supervised 17 school RWH systems for SLWP (supported by NDB)in the Central Province.
Aranayake 2016
Last year, Aranayake suffered a major disaster with a landslide which occurred on the Samasara Mountain. The reasons for the disaster are partly climate change driven and partly anthropogenic. Many areas in and around Aranayake have been identified as being major and medium risk landslide prone sites. The threat is exacerbated by the high degrees of ongoing illicit logging and poor land use practices. Community members also state that water supply has drastically decreased since the landslide.
The complexity of this disaster has highlighted the need for speedily operationalizing the SDGs in future activities.The Hatton National Bank/SLWP intervention coming at this juncture is therefore timely and together we undertook a programme of looking to operationalize DRR in Aranayake which is recovering from the landslide. The programme was executed in two phases.
The total activity of Phase 1 consisted of:
a )initial reconnaissance survey leading to an inception report,
b) Climate Change adaptation (CCA ) activity cum RWH maintenance training,
c) construction of the RWH tanks in selected sites,
d) organization of Disaster Risk Reduction /CCA sensitization programmes in the selected schools for World Water Day in March 2017 and
e/f) follow-up maintenance reinforcement programmes before the SW and NE monsoon (these two activities will be linked with the youth program being developed with an initial meeting which was held on May 27.
Display boards giving a DRR message have been set up as requested by local partners to build community awareness.
The three main objectives of Phase 2 building on the lessons learnt in Phase 1 are:
a) Community SDG advocacy focusing on youth
b) Provision of Rain Water Harvesting systems for schools and
c) Micro catchment conservation in Medium Risk areas.
This programme will help catalyse community participation and support including mobilization for aftercare and expansion. The total activities will consist of a reconnaissance survey for site selection, construction of the RWH tanks in selected sites,a CCA cum RWH maintenance training, micro- catchment conservation with community groups and related community advocacy. Six schools shortlisted by the MKSV and the Aranayake Zonal Education office would be selected for provision of rainwater harvesting systems.
The schools thus shortlisted are; Damapalgoda Secondary School, Kalugala Secondary School, Tammitta Secondary School, Thelleka Secondary School, Dothuluoya Secondary School and Gangthuna Udagama Secondary School.
Rain Water Harvesting
According to the experience of the field team in Phase 1, there were certain issues and activities identified to be implemented in Phase 2.
Thus it was noted that the provision of six RWH systems to marginalized schools was very useful for promoting health and sanitation and thereby, supports access to education. It was also a preliminary tool to building linkages with marginalized landslide prone communities, especially those identified by National Building Research Organization (NBRO) as medium risk in order to promote conservation.These RWH systems also allowed community members themselves be involved in them and all unskilled labour will be accessed from the community in Phase 2.
Catchment conservation in Aranayake is essential in view of the threat of imminent future landslides in 62 Grama Niladari divisions as noted by the NBRO. Unplanned expansion with poor soil conservation by tea small holders continues to pose threats as well. So does the very high level of continuous illicit logging. High risk area families have been evacuated. But, most of the medium risk communities (who have been notified by registered post of their status by the District Secretary) however, are currently in a state of denial stating that their lands are safe. They need to be encouraged to improve land conservation urgently at least before the North East monsoon. Schools which have received RWH systems will contribute plants for reforestation programmes. Therefore, it is important to start community advocacy and pilot activities in micro catchments as part of disaster risk reduction. The criteria of selection for such sites should be the level of risk and the level of community support, especially from youth groups. Strong community organizations identified from among existing organization in activity A, will be selected as catalysts to mobilize the community.
Aranayake in a state of dependency
Aranayake used to be a fairly self sufficient community with high income from spices. In the aftermath of the landslide however, it was noted that the community showed increased dependency on state agencies and external sources, especially due to the deluge of aid (mostly inappropriate and underutilized) which came in to the region.Communities are now reluctant to carry out even minor soil conservation activities which can be done independently without state support. Hence mitigation efforts at present are proceeding very slowly.
Thus it was noted that existing community groups should be mobilized with a special focused effort to enthuse youth groups while understanding challenges posed by deep seated community and caste divides.
There is also a community divide based on economic factors; there is tendency to blame the tea smallholders for their inappropriate cultivation practices. Therefore, initiating community advocacy in the form of group meetings is a critical factor in Phase 2. As the temples in the area are the focus of response in disaster situations, the possibility of inviting monks from the medium risk area for the sensitization programmes is being explored. Schools which have received RWH systems will contribute plants for reforestation programmes thereby, ensuring community buy in.
When it comes to alternative incomes for community members, catchment conservation should ensure the planting of spice trees which will given an income as well provide ground coverage. Work will be carried out with participation of volunteer labour. Support will also be accessed from the Department of Export Agriculture for this purpose.
Phase 2
Under Phase 2, the following has been proposed: by end of April, a reconnaissance visit for RWH site selection and identification of community groups and micro catchments was undertaken to finalize sites/identify groups - lead NWW and MKSV, from May to June; RWH construction and CCA /DRR sensitization cum RWH maintenance training would be carried out to provide water security and improved sanitation, build awareness of DRR, importance of water security and CCA lead NWW MKSV, in May and September; there will be community advocacy programmes for capacity building for community groups and reinforcement for key stakeholders, also from May and June; construction of six RWH tanks in the six selected schools will take place to provide water security to the area and from May to September micro catchment conservation and replanting will occur for reinforcement and enhancing school and community support for DRR and CCA.
The experience above highlights that DRR is not only important in post disaster situations but also before one occurs; to mitigate the impact of disasters. Specialised DRR programmes in all risk prone areas in the country will help in future reduce the tragedy of the natural disasters we now face.

Pathway to inner beauty or Dune sacred sites
Juliet Coombe believesMuhudu Maha Vihara in centuries gone by was a popular pilgrim route to Anuradhpura from Magam via Pottuvil, which over time vanished into the dunes.
It is only 9am and already the sand is scorching hot underfoot as we join Buddhist pilgrims at Muhudu Maha Vihara to see the approximately 2300-year-old temple complex. The magnificent ruins are hidden inside the dunes and are one of only two historic Buddhist religious historic sites on this eastern seashore, which is known as Sri Lankas surf capital.
The temple complex is 3.5 km beyond Pottuvil, on the A4 Road where goats scamper, surfers surf at dawn and finally the houses are replaced by yellow sand dunes, which appear like giant rocks scattered along the coastline. These dunes today are seen as key to protecting the land from progressive sea encroachment and hold a great deal of Buddhist history and many other secrets just waiting to be dug up.
The landmark
On arrival it is important to cover your shoulders and leave the shoes at the entrance, even the umbrellas used to shade you from the sun should be left behind. Muhudu Maha Vihara according to the small booklet at the entrance dates back to the reign of King Mahanaga, who built this temple in the 8th Century.
The King Kavantissa sacrificed his only daughter Vihara Maha Devi to the sea to avert a catastrophe in the area and it is said that a boat was buried in the temple grounds. The kings daughter was later washed ashore near the East coast, where Muhudu Maha Vihara stands today. Other stories say she went to Kirinda and where ever she went the importance of these ruins remained.
Resident temples Buddhist monk Udlamatta Ratnapriya is happy to tell you about this historical site in the shade of the trees near where the pilgrims hang lucky wishes and make prayers daily. Some say this series of temple columns is near where the Queen bathed in sandalwood and this is where she also kept her royal jewellery. The monk feels this is just one of the reasons why so many pilgrims leave a special message hoping it will be granted as the place has a magical feel about it.
Its dagoba is the landmark when searching for the royal statues half buried amidst the ruins and sand it is currently being rebuilt and in front of it recent discoveries of more temple complex have been made since a stone was laid in 2013. The 28th King according to the Mahavansa King Maha Naga built this Mudu temple for the memory of King Kavantissa and his Queen Vihara Maha Devi.
To its west are the remains of a pillared structure where the torso of a Buddha statue was found and later restored by the Department of Archaeology. The seashore covers much of the site where the dagoba lies, yet to be excavated and some bits that are now showing are due to the 2004 tsunami waters bringing them out and the wind that moves sand revealing and hiding new ruins. Several stone pillars and broken bricks are visible from nearby. When this was uncovered, there emerged two beautiful life-size stone statues of Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara.
An archaeological reserve
This sacred spot is lit at night and would make a wonderful evening trip when its cooler underfoot from the burning sand. Ideally just before sun set to enjoy the sparkling statues made of local crystal stone like granite that can be picked out in the sun light revealing the brilliance of the islands mastercraftman ship taking the form of a life size statues of the King and the Queen Vihara Maha Devi standing in front of the Buddha statue making it one of the great temple settings after sunset one can feel the mystery of this historic site.
The survey plan of the temple shows that the Muhudu Maha Vihara possessed 264 acres of land on the coastal strip a one time. A government gazette notification issued in 1965 states that the temple had been given 30 acres of land and is protected as an archaeological reserve. Unfortunately, the temple today now has only three acres as villagers have acquired the rest of the land, where many other interesting artifacts may yet be discovered.
Just 10 km away from Muhudu Maha Vihare in Pottuvil into the land in Lahugala National Park, and next door to it is another temple called Magul Maha Vihara with a number of ruins including a stone carved wedding platform (Magul Poruwa) believed to be used by King Kavantissa and Queen Vihara Maha Devi who it is said were married at this site and the most spectacular moonstone of man riding an elephant that can be found under the roots of an old Banyan tree at the main entrance.
The sand dunes absorb the merciless sunrays during the scorching midday heat, and attempting to tread on the dunes is akin to walking on red-hot embers and so it is important to see both sites either early or late in the day. Also take someone who knows the places and tell you more about the places like the resident monks, or village elder whose knowledge of this temple in the dunes is fascinating and passion even on the hottest of days inspiring.

Three ships of the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLA Navy) arrived at the Port of Colombo on Wednesday evening to assist the ongoing relief operations, following the adverse weather that wreaked havoc in the island nation.
The ships which were initially on a goodwill, subsequently focused their intentions on relief efforts to help the general public battered by inclement weather. Incidentally, 5 teams of medical personnel along with 10 small boats aboard these ships, are expected to be deployed in relief operations in close collaboration with the Sri Lanka Nav.
The large consignment of relief materials dispatched by the Chinese Government was officially handed over to the Navy Commander. This noble gesture yet again proved the long and strong camaraderie of the two countries and mutual cooperation between the PLA and Sri Lanka Navies.

Plan to keep elephants away from landfill sites
Programme in nine LG bodies:
Fifty four landfill areas within elephants' reach:
Japanese manufactured compost plants will be established in nine local government bodies to prevent landfill sites from turning into feeding grounds of wild elephants.
The nine areas are: Mahara Pradeshiya Sabha, Ibbagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha, Wadamarachchi Pradeshiya Sabha, Hambantota Municipal Council, Addalaichena Pradeshiya Sabha, Bandarawela Municipal Council, Kegalle Urban Council, Dambulla Municipal Council and Polonnaruwa Municipal Council areas. A joint proposal on the compost plants submitted by Wildlife and Sustainable Development Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera and Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha, was approved by the Cabinet.
The Wildlife Ministry has identified 54 landfill areas near wildlife sanctuaries, which have become accessible to elephants. The ministry estimates that over 300 elephants congregate around these sites daily for food.
The elephant when used to the consumption of garbage makes it a habit to have garbage regularly. The herds of elephants that come to such places are seemingly increasing by the day. Unsegregated polythene, residual food, rotten meat / fish and other poisonous substances are infected with bacteria cause the animal to fall sick and shortens its lifespan.
In March, the media reported of a 20-year-old elephant dying near the Manampitiya garbage dump due to toxic bacteria from the rotten food in the dump.
A World Bank report estimates that each Sri Lankan would generate 1kg of garbage per day by 2025.
The Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry has proposed that the Rs. 1,660 million Korean loan facility made available for 2017 be used to purchase compost plants from the company, Kawishima Pvt Ltd. One of their plants functions in the Kundasale Pradeshiya Sabha and handles 17 metric tons of biodegradable waste. The plant costing Rs. 123 million can handle up to 50 metric tons of waste per day and will take 60 days to produce organic fertilizer. The project will be launched as a commercial venture.
The Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry will extent the waste segregation programme to all local government authorities in the country. The Wildlife Ministry will build electric fences around waste disposal sites to prevent elephants from having access to garbage.

Present flood is outcome of past politicos follies: President
The destruction and sufferings caused by floods and landslides in the country every year could have been permanently stopped by now if we were able to implement a scientific flood prevention project planned decades ago by American experts with the support of our local irrigation engineers, President Maitripala Sirisena said.
The respective governments in the past had failed to implement the above mentioned massive flood prevention scheme. Hence, all previous governments that failed to implement such an expedient national plan and politicians who obstructed such a prized development plan are responsible for the present day flood calamity faced by the country,the President observed.
The President was speaking at a meeting of regional political leaders and state officials at the special Galle District Coordinating Meeting held at the Galle District Secretariat Auditorium yesterday. President Sirisena who affirmed his governments firm resolution, dedication and commitment to find a permanent solution to this complex issue of regular flood chaos assured to take swift measures to initiate the once neglected project in consultation with experts in the field for the benefit of the country and people.
Galle District Secretary S.T. Kodikara had convened the meeting to discuss and coordinate urgent matters concerning the post flood disaster management activities of the district on instructions from Co-chairs Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva, Minister Chandima Weerakkodi and Galle District Parliamentarian Wijepala Hettiarachchi. An American team of irrigation experts prepared a comprehensive flood control project in 1968 in respect of the Ratnapura, Kalutara and Galle districts which are the most flood-prone.However, this very methodical and guaranteed scheme could not be implemented owing to the objections of various petty minded politicians, President Sirisena said.
We need to arrive at resolute decisions over the issue and plan and implement viable schemes to end the protracted problem. Many of the completely or partly destroyed households are constructed on restricted or reserved lands. Many of such lands are constantly prone to natural disasters such as floods and landslides. At every instance they are destroyed in extreme weather conditions, the government spends massive amounts of money to reconstruct and repair them. For the last few decades we have been repeating the same rehabilitation work, the President said. We should end the recurrence of the wasteful reconstruction work after every flood. Instead, we should implement scientific plans to end issues concerning floods throughout the country. For this we have to educate the public with the help of the respective political leadership of such areas. We are going to stop the reconstruction of residencies at restricted and reserved locations, specially identified as risk prone areas. For this national obligation all politicians, should extend their fullest support shunning all differences, Preisdnet Sirisena said.
I very sincerely request all political and community leaders to help our state officials to find suitablelocations for resettlement of flood displaced persons. We should find new lands for those people who are living in disaster prone areas. The respective government officials can select locations on government own lands. If needed the government is ready to acquire private lands for the purpose. The main requirement in this regard is to educate the public correctly on the dangers of living on unsafe lands, the President said.
President Sirisena also requested all concerned parties to coordinate with government agencies in initiating flood relief and welfare programmes.
All requirement regarding flood relief and welfare activities should be channeled through the respective District Secretaries of the corresponding regions. The Disaster Management Ministry is ready to supply any requirements which are channeled through the correct state officials.

Princes William and Harry make Diana documentary to 'stand up' for their mother

The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry say they are doing their duty as sons by taking part in a BBC documentary about their mother.
They want to "stand up for her name", saying they felt they let her down in the past by not protecting her.
The programme will include William and Harry speaking about the week following her death, from the moment they heard the news to the day of her funeral.
It comes ahead of the 20th anniversary of Diana's death on 31 August.
In the 90-minute documentary, with the working title Diana, William is to say: "Part of the reason why Harry and I want to do this is because we feel we owe it to her.
"I think an element of it is feeling like we let her down when we were younger. We couldn't protect her.
"We feel we at least owe her 20 years on to stand up for her name and remind everybody of the character and person that she was.
"Do our duties as sons in protecting her."
Harry said the outpouring of emotion and love was "shocking" to him as a young boy.
"It was beautiful at the same time, and it was amazing, now looking back at it, it was amazing that our mother had such a huge effect on so many people.
"When you're that young and something like that happens to you, I think it's lodged in here, there, wherever - in your heart, in your head and it stays there for a very, very long time.
"I think it's never going to be easy for the two of us to talk about our mother, but 20 years on seems like a good time to remind people of the difference that she made not just to the royal family but also to the world."
The film features interviews with close friends, political figures and journalists, some of whom are speaking about Diana's death and its aftermath for the first time.
The BBC has also announced a one-off drama calledDiana and I, about the impact of Diana's death on four members of the public.
William also spoke toGQthis week about his mother's death and his sadness that she had not lived to meet his wife Catherine or children George and Charlotte.
News of the documentary comes days after Channel 5 broadcastSeven Days that Shook the Windsors, looking at the aftermath of Diana's death.
The broadcaster caused controversy last month when it aired royal drama King Charles III, based on Mike Bartlett's play of the same name, which sees the Prince of Wales succeeding his mother and sparking a constitutional crisis.
The actor who plays Prince Williamsaid he was "surprised"by the controversy it has caused.
In 2013 double Oscar nominee Naomi Watts starred in a film called Diana, which covered the last two years of her life.
There was some controversy about the movie, with some describing it as being in poor taste, but Watts said at the time she hoped it had been done in a"respectful and sensitive"way.

Request to release Anura Senanayake turned down
A request made by defence to release former Senior DIG Anura Senanayake from remand custody was yesterday turned down by Colombo Additional Magistrate J. Trotsky.
Accordingly, Anura Senanayake arrested over his alleged role in the cover up of evidence and conspiring to committing the murder of former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till June 15 by Colombo Additional Magistrate.
Presidents Counsel Anil de Silva appearing on behalf of the suspect requested to release his client from remand custody since he is held in remand custody over a period of one year contrary to the provisions of Bail Act.
Defence counsel submitted to Court that his client had been arrested by CID on May 23, 2016. He contended that in terms of Section 16 of the Bail Act, no person should be detained for more than twelve months in custody. However, Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing for the CID told Court that a Magistrate has no jurisdiction to release a person accused of conspiring to commit a murder and the defence should make this application from High Court. He further argued that it would be an illegal order if a Magistrate decided to release such a person from the custody.
Taking into consideration the facts, the Additional Magistrate observed that the Magistrates Court does not have power to release a person accused of conspiring to commit a murder and ordered to further remand the suspect till June 15.
The revision bail application filed by Anura Senanayake seeking bail is to be taken up before Colombo High Court today (02).
Former Narahenpita Crimes OIC arrested over the same allegation is currently out on bail.

Root leads England to victory in Champions Trophy opener
London: Joe Roots career-best unbeaten 133 saw England to an eight-wicket win over Bangladesh in the opening match of the 2017 Champions Trophy at the Oval on Thursday.
England, set 306 for victory, finished on 308 for two with 16 balls to spare.
Roots innings was his highest in one-day internationals, surpassing his 125 against South Africa at Centurion last year.
Englands total was also the highest score by a team batting second to win a Champions Trophy match, topping Sri Lankas 297 for three against them at the Oval four years ago.
Root put on 159 with opener Alex Hales (95) and an unbroken 143 for the third wicket with skipper Eoin Morgan (75 not out).
But worryingly for England, bidding to win their first major International Cricket Council ODI trophy, paceman Chris Woakes bowled just two overs before suffering a potentially tournament-ending left side strain.
And Jason Roy, a day after Morgan guaranteed his tournament place, fell for just one -- his fifth single figure score in his last six ODI innings.
Meanwhile Root suffered a calf injury while batting.
Earlier Tamim Iqbals 128 was the centrepiece of Bangladeshs 305 for six after they lost the toss.
Tamim received excellent support from Mushfiqur Rahim (79) in a third-wicket partnership of 166.
That was Bangladeshs highest ODI stand outside of Asia, surpassing the 141 put on by Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah when the Tigers knocked England out of the 2015 World Cup with a dramatic 15-run win in Adelaide.
Both batsmen, however, fell in successive balls from Liam Plunkett to leave Bangladesh 261 for four in the 45th over.
Fast bowler Plunkett took four wickets for 59 runs from his maximum 10 overs.
England came into this tournament featuring the worlds top eight ODI sides having made huge strides in white-ball cricket in the past two years.
But they had to work hard in the field against a Bangladesh side skittled out for just 84 by Champions Trophy holders India in a warm-up match at the Oval on Tuesday.
All-rounder Ben Stokes despite a knee problem that had previously hampered him in his delivery stride, made the breakthrough when, with the last ball of his first over, Soumya Sarkar uppercut him straight to substitute Jonny Bairstow at deep cover for 38.
But as the runs kept coming, an increasingly frustrated Stokes exchanged words with Tamim and mockingly patted him on the shoulder at the end of the 32nd over, with umpires Rod Tucker and S Ravi intervening to calm tempers.
Meanwhile a single against off-spinner Moeen Ali saw Tamim to his ninth ODI century in 124 balls, including 11 fours and a six.
The 28-year-old, who drove Ali for another soaring straight six, fell when wicket-keeper Jos Buttler held a skyed pull off Plunkett.
The batsmen had crossed and next ball Mushfiqur carelessly holed out to long-off, with Bangladesh only managing a relatively modest 43 off the last five overs.
There was no comfort for Roy on his Surrey home ground when he saw an attempted scoop off Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza brilliantly caught by a leaping Mustafizur Rahman at short fine leg.
Hales, rarely troubled by a Bangladesh attack lacking a genuine fast bowler, struck a four and a six off successive balls only to hole out off the leg-spinners next delivery.
Bangladesh thought they had Morgan out for 22 when Tamim, running in from long-on, claimed a low catch but third umpire Bruce Oxenford ruled the ball had touched the turf.
Roots two off Mortaza took him to a 10th ODI hundred in 115 balls with six fours.
Not known as a big-hitter, Root later lofted Rubel Hossain for a straight six and ended the match with a four off Mossadek Hossain.
Bangladesh return to the Oval to face Australia on June 5, with England continuing their Group A campaign against New Zealand in Cardiff the following day. AFP

Royal savour one of their finest moments in rugby
Royal College Colombo savoured one of their finest moments on the rugby field when they won the inter-schools Singer league rugby tournament decider with a near flawless 22-17 win over Trinity College, Kandy in their own den at Pallekelle.
It was a glorious end to the 2017 schools league for the glamour boys of schools rugby who improved vastly when the season progressed enjoying tremendous success winning against all the schools with one blemish losing 17-22 to 2017 league runners-up Isipathana College.
It was the special brand of the now famous rolling maul through their granite forwards that Royal are famous for which enabled them to be different from all other school sides.
Royal clinched the coveted Singer rugby league trophy for the 11th time in their history.
The Daily News spoke to some of the rugby stalwarts including their head coach, captain and asked them for their opinion of the 2017 teams performance in the just concluded Singer league tournament.
Sanath Martis (Head coach of Royal): It was a collective effort and in the bigger picture I got all my ammunition together and made this team victorious as well as a champion outfit. I would like to thank my team, their parents, rugby advisory board, Rohantha Peiris, MIC Gamini Sarathchandra, support staff of Dushanth Lewke, Ajith Silva, Sunimal Manamperi, Akila Perera, Supun Warnakulasooriya (manager), medical staff of Dr. Harindhu Wijesinghe, Thushantha, Kithsiri, Banaka Fernando, Principal and the admin and, all those Royalists young and old who has supported us.
Rohantha Peiris (Chairman Royal Rugby advisory committee): We started the season in a simple beginning. Isipathana, Dharmaraja, St. Peters, Wesley, Trinity were really outstanding. We had one or two good players but we did not have the kind of brilliant players like Isipathana. If you recall the 1978 Royal team which I captained had only five coloursmen. The present side played as one team and Ovin Askey led them admirably throughout the season. Captaincy is a very important aspect when it comes to winning championships. Behind the scene leadership is very much required when moving forward and young Askey proved that by being a brilliant captain. Until we win the Bradby we are not complete. Hats off to all, who have supported us on and off the field. I am happy with all what I have got from them and it was a true team effort and we were like one whole family together.
Ovin Askey (Royal College 2017 1st XV rugby captain): It was a great victory for all the Royalists out there. All my boys played their hearts out not only today but throughout the entire league and I am really grateful and proud of them. We had a minor setback where we lost to defending champions Isipathana (17-22) midway in the league, but we quickly rectified our mistakes and came back strongly to clinch the prestigious Singer inter-school league title. I would like to thank Martis sir (Sanath), Lewke sir (Dushanth), Gamini sir (Sarathchandra), Supun sir (Warnakulasooriya), our school rugby committee, all the parents, all the Royalists young and old and all well-wishes.
Wasantha Perera (Royal old boy): It was sheer hard work, dedication and team work. Captain Ovin Askey got the entire team to this stage by rallying them around him. All were one unit and they never gave up. This was a highly confident bunch of players. The seasons midway tournament loss to Isipathana enabled them to be more focussed with the help of the tireless coaching staff and captain Askeys motivation. Their forwards are the unsung heroes for me. They are behind this sensational win and their defence was excellent. Hats off to our entire forwards for their tireless performance right throughout. This was completely a team effort and the entire squad of players delivered in the end to be undisputed league champs of Sri Lanka schools rugby.
Senior DIG Nimal Lewke (Former SLRFU president and national rugby head coach): When Royal started the season they were not a good team but they shifted three of their three quarters to the pack due to the coaching staffs mounting knowledge. It was a big risk they had taken but within a little period of time Royal dominated through their forwards. The entire Royal coaching staff has done a wonderful job, especially the players tackling was of really high class; not only did they bring down the opponents but they secured ball position as well. Within a short period of time they have produced a champion outfit. Compared to how Royal started the season and how Trinity started, Royal were 15-all with Dharmaraja and thanks to Askeys last minute drop goal it secured them the 18-15 win and with Isipathana they lost 17-22, while Trinity were thrashing all their opponents over 50 points. From the Isipathana game onwards the preparation of Royal was marvelous and they played as a team. Ovin Askey led the team brilliantly. Their place kicking was excellent and having two reliable kickers was a confident booster for in the end the relevant kicks made the difference. Congrats to Royal and their entire support staff.

She Said Yes
When you have a crush, they say, its always best to crush the crush. But not if you happen to be Katie Holmes. A year after she had left her role as Joey Potter on Dawsons Creek, when she said in an interview with Seventeen magazine, I think every little girl dreams about her wedding, I used to think I was going to marry Tom Cruise, her message reached its target. Two years later her crush became her husband.
The Dawsons Creek star, 37, and Mission Impossible hunk, 54, tied the knot on November 18, 2006, in a lavish Italian wedding. Inside Italys 15th-century Odescalchi Castle known as Bracciano, the couple shared their vows before a star-studded guest list that included the likes of Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, John Travolta, David Beckham and Victoria Beckham, Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez as well as Cruises older kids - Isabella and Connor and ex-wife Nicole Kidman.
The event that led to the wedding had as much drama as one of Cruises movies. Especially when Cruise appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and declared his love for Holmes and went on to punch the floor, grab Winfreys hands and, most memorably, jump on her couch with joy. (The appearance instantly became infamous, known as Cruises couch jumping episode). This was followed by the announcement of their engagement, just shy of eight weeks from having first met. Cruise proposed to Holmes in Paris at the Eiffel Tower at a restaurant on the Towers second floor. He did not go down on one knee, but he presented her with a ring reportedly containing a five-carat yellow diamond. She said yes.
Their wedding reportedly cost a cool $3 million. Not to mention, Holmes wore two custom gowns by Giorgio Armani - including one strapless lace dress that was covered with thousands of Swarovski crystals that reportedly took 350 hours to place. Armani also designed the entire wedding partys ensemble, including Toms wedding tux, and the bridesmaids and groomsmens apparel.
The wedding ceremony itself was short and sweet, lasting only 15 minutes. The real fireworks were outside, where a magnificent fireworks display erupted over the castle. Inside, guests dined on four courses, including sea bass and steak, before enjoying a five-tier white chocolate wedding cake. They were serenaded by famed Italian opera superstar Andrea Bocelli, and Tom Cruise himself sang The Righteous Brothers Youve Lost That Loving Feeling. It was a strange choice for a wedding serenade, even if it was a scene from Top Gun.
Called the celebrity wedding of the year, if not the decade, with a price tag that grand, Tom and Katies wedding cemented itself in celebrity bridal history. From the cream of the crop Hollywood guest list and double wedding gowns to a dinner serenade by Bocelli, it looked as though no expense was spared on the night Katie Holmes became Mrs. Tom Cruise.
As bizarre as Cruises dating tactics may seem, a source who knows the couple said Cruise was completely in love with Katie.
Obviously, some crushes should not be crushed.

Sooriya Village: A taste to remember
Being a food enthusiast and being very selective about the food I eat, I find good food irresistible. I must say that while consuming delicious food, in addition to my body enjoying it my mind is transported to different worlds where I pleasantly dwell. I, for one feel that without food the human personality is incomplete.
To me food is one of the most wonderful creations of life. When I was invited to Sooriya Village by Sooriya Village to sample their food, I certainly wondered what that experience would be like. When I visited Sooriya Village I must say that my body and mind responded positively to the food that was on offer. The food in other words was an absolutely mouth -watering mixture of food. Today Daily News critiques the Sooriya Village.
In addition to the food being appealing the right sort of ambience is there as well.
A must have
While you are at the Sooriya Village why not taste its Mini Isso Wade Now this one was the most eye catching at my table and certainly appetizing. Its brownish tinge gives it a spicy look, which is what one tastes when biting into it. And it was one of the most savory items on the table. The smoked salmon on mini toasties was another food item that I personally feel is one of the best smoked salmon I have tasted.
The Chicken Satay with Peanut Sauce was extremely succulent with that curry like color. The Mini Sausage Puffs/ Mini Fish Buns were also present, but this was of course similar to that which we might find in any posh food outlet. The Devilled Stuffed Eggs were another interesting addition, one that will really attract egg lovers. The Creamy Mushroom and Prawn Vol Au Vaunts really were delectable and a must have for mushroom and prawn lovers.
The Mutton Kebabs with a Chili Mint Dip may not appeal to many, but mutton lovers would not find this food item unwelcome.
The Vegetable Tempura! Ah a welcome addition for those who like vegetables with their meat, and for die hard vegetarians. Just looking at this food item makes one crave this item with its puffed up look and greenish tinge.
Looks good and tastes good
The Mushroom and Asparagus Quiche Squares, has that roasted look and fullness that makes food items at Sooriya Village such enticing. To me it has that pizza look.
However the food we were served did not end here. It got better! More and more dishes came our way like some feast hosted by a king or prince. In a way it was a feast hosted by a prince  Koluu. A culinary prince, who makes everyone who come to Sooriya Village special and treated like royalty.
Vegetable Tempura with Tartar Sauce, Devilled Shrimp on Mini Pol Roti, Mini Isso Wade, Mushroom and Asparagus Quiche Squares came on one dish. What an assortment! There were curries on the plate and sauce, and one could dip these items and enjoy these flavors to the maximum.
Finally the spicy delights were replaced by dessert. The mini brownies and clairs. The sweetness was a lovely way to end the day after a heavy and superb dinner.
At Sooriya Village the dinner or lunch is something that is well balanced with the right kind of food items. The food looks good and tastes good. Of course the Sooriya Village is not the only one of its kind obviously. There are some top class five star hotels in Colombo.
However this article wishes to say that Sooriya Village is an option if you want to have a lovely dinner out. It is friendly and fun to visit.

Sri Lanka skipper doubtful for Champions Trophy opener
June1, 2017
Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews has suffered a calf injury and may not play in their first Champions Trophy group match on Saturday, the cricket board said.
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) said he was most likely to sit out the 50-over match against South Africa at the Oval, in south London.
Mathews rejoined the team after a five-month layoff due to a hamstring injury that forced him to return home halfway through the tour of South Africa in January.
The board said Mathews, who turns 30 on Friday, had complained of stiffness and pain. A medical examination revealed a strain on the muscle.
Mathews will engage in supervised recovery over the next few days but will most likely sit out the first group stage match against South Africa, SLC said in a statement on Thursday.
He had been declared fit for the 50-over showpiece event after a week-long high intensity training camp in central Sri Lanka.
Mathews, who last played an ODI in the home series loss to Australia in August 2016, was upbeat when the Sri Lankan squad left for London two weeks ago to prepare for the tournament.
But he warned: We dont have time for hiccups in a tournament like this. Sri Lanka are in Group B with India, Pakistan and South Africa. AFP

SRI LANKAN IN AIRLINE BOMB DRAMA
Just released from psychiatric care:
Entered cockpit threatening to blow up plane:
Overpowered by terrified passengers :
A Sri Lankan man who tried to enter an airline cockpit with what he said was a bomb, before terrified passengers managed to overpower him, had just been released from psychiatric care when he boarded the plane, Australian police said Thursday. Those on board the Malaysian Airlines flight from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur said they feared for their lives when the 25-year-old rushed towards the cockpit shouting that he wanted to blow the plane up.
He had been released from psychiatric care (on Wednesday), and from there we believe he has purchased a ticket on this plane... and then got out to the airport and on that plane, Victoria state police chief Graham Ashton told reporters.
Several passengers wrestled him to the floor and tied him up before the plane made an emergency landing at Melbourne airport. Armed officers from an elite police unit boarded the flight,handcuffing the man and escorting him off the plane. Photographs on national media showed black-clad officers carrying rifles in the cabin. The suspect, who lived in the Melbourne suburb of Dandenong and was studying to be a chef, said he was carrying a bomb but the device was actually a bluetooth speaker slightly larger than an iPhone, Ashton said.
He added that the incident was no longer being treated as possibly linked to terrorism, but instead a case involving a mental health issue.
The unnamed man is now being questioned by investigators. He faces charges of making threats and false claims, and of endangering an aircrafts safety -- offences that carry a 10-year sentence. Malaysian Deputy Transport Minister Abdul Aziz Kaprawi earlier told AFP the incident was not a hijack but involved one disruptive passenger (who) tried to enter the planes cockpit.
While officials played down the incident, passengers spoke of a terrifying 90-minute ordeal after the plane took off.
A business class passenger, former Australian Rules football player Andrew Leoncelli, told Melbourne radio station 3AW that the arrested man threatened to blow the plane up.
The staff were saying Sit back down sir, sit back down sir. He goes No, Im not going to sit back down, Im going to blow the plane up, he told 3AW.
The staff screamed out I need some help, I need some help. So I jumped up, undid my buckle, and approached him. Leoncelli said the would-be bomber ran to the back of the plane, where two other men grabbed him, removed the apparent device, and put hog ties on him. Passenger Arif Chaudery said he joined several others to subdue the man.
Families, kids, they were very scared, and some screaming... so three or four guys, we jumped as quickly as possible, he told Channel Nine television. - AFP

He attended Trinity from 1956 to 1968; he captained the unbeaten rugby team of 1967 and the following year was awarded the Lion. He also won the Ryde Gold Medal for best all-round student which is the highest award at Trinity. He also led the Combined Schools team and played cricket for his alma mater from 1966-68 and won the best bowlers prize in 1968. Against Royal he scored a century in 69 minutes off 62 balls that included 11 fours and two sixes.
Some of the players in the 1967 rugby team were Ajith Abeyratne (captain), Shafie Jainudeen, Iswan Omar, Gamini Udugama, Alex Lazarus, Stephen Paul, Anil Siriwardene, Dudley Dissanayake, Mahendra Thalwatte, M. Affif, Errol Warne, Mohan Balasuriya, Jadi Dissanayake, Gogi Tillakaratne, B. Shanthi Kumar. N.T.B. Dassanayake, Ranjan Nadarajah, Rafi Ismail, Mark Sundaralingam and Prince Nayagam. The coach was Lt. Denzil Kobbekaduwa and the Principal was C.J. Oorloff.
After leaving school Ajith went to Colombo and played cricket for CCC and rugby for CR & FC. He led CR and FC from 1968-1974 and also played for Low Country and the Country 1968-1971.

Unauthorised buildings create deathtraps: Patali
People who put up unauthorised buildings are creating their own graves, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka making a special statement on the recent natural disaster faced by the country.
He said nearly 200 lives were lost and nearly another 100 went missing due to the recent rain, floods and landslides. The Western and Southern Provinces faced the brunt of this calamity, he said.
Last year too, rains experienced on May 16 caused the biggest damage in the Kelani Valley region. This time, floods affected areas around the Kelani, Gin and Nilwala rivers, the minister said.
"More lives were lost this time and hundreds of thousands had been displaced. We as a country or people could not avert disasters caused by climatic changes. But part of the damage was caused by man made disasters such as unauthorised land reclamation and building construction," he said.
Minister Ranawaka said glaciers melted due to global warming. The world would face more flood, landslide and drought situations. Sri Lanka being an island would have to brace up to a host of problems in future. The biggest problem is the manner in which we should face these problems, he said.
Although our meteorological department was greatly ill-equipped, it could rely on accurate weather information relayed by sophisticated media sources such as the BBC, CNN and Al Jazeera. There was satellite information available in the world. But the Meteorological Department could not issue an early warning about the disaster, Minister Ranawaka said.

Union Cabinet to take call on  Air India privatisation
The Union Cabinet will soon take a call on whether lossmaking Air India should be privatised with NITI Aayog suggesting that taxpayers' money being pumped into the airline can instead be used on health and education.
"The financial position of Air India is very bad. Niti Aayog's view is that government should spend money on health, education, instead of spending Rs 30,000 crore on Air India," a top government official said.
While details of the proposed privatisation were not clear, the possibilities of a strategic stake sale as well as outright disinvestments are under consideration.
The Civil Aviation Ministry is already looking into the recommendations made by NITI Aayog for the national carrier's revival.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had last week said Air India's disinvestment saying the carrier's market share is just around 14 per cent whereas the debt burden is Rs 50,000 crore.
Air India is staying afloat on a bailout package of little over Rs 30,000 crore extended by the previous UPA regime. It is working on ways to improve its financial position amid stiff competition.
Since merging with Indian Airlines, Air India has been in the red.
However, it posted an operational profit of Rs 105 crore on account of low fuel prices and increased passenger numbers in 2015-16.
The discussions on disinvestment have gathered momentum at a time when the CBI has registered three FIRs and a preliminary enquiry (PE) to go into the controversial decisions made by the erstwhile UPA government with regard to Air India, including surrender of profitable routes to favour private airlines.

Unparalleled academic progress
A marvellously renowned spot known as Sujatha Vidyalaya with a heritage of glorious history stands out as the most significant and popular among many schools in Colombo. Situated around five minutes drive from Nugegoda junction in a picturesque scenic location, originally surrounded by lush greenery, now consisting of an intellectual crowd is a well-established perfect educational institution in the true sense of the word.
This enchanting place is among the oldest set ups in Colombo well before the international schools came into existence which throws light on the immediate post-Independence era. History of Sujatha Vidyalaya dates back to 1965 when it was first founded in No. 17, Alfred Place, Colpetty, Colombo. Whatever this may mean, it cannot be denied that Sujatha Vidyalaya owes its origin to Colpetty though later moved to reputed places in Queens Road, Jayah Road and finally to Nugegoda where the highest quality of education is offered for a better world.
Early beginnings
The school was founded on June 1, 1965, by the Founder, Architect and Pioneer late Linton Kuruppu, joined by Clara Motwani as the Principal well experienced. They both devoted their lives to the magnificent task.
There lies the beginning of this great institution. It heralded the beginning of Sri Lankas education in English medium after the departure of the colonial masters from then Ceylon, the fascinating history that was to change the face of Sri Lanka. It was during this time that the then Sujathians dipped their pens in the ink pot to write English for the first time.
This needs no further explanation to the intelligentsia of the present day. The name of Sujatha has spread around the globe. Here is the central and main destination that part of the city of Nugegoda is being adorned by Sujatha in several places and also Maharagama.
The tactful manner in facing immediate problems and their determinations to guide it in the correct path made them work hard. A good foundation was laid by giving special attention to religious work and numerous other extra activities like sports aesthetic and other living skills like home science and needlework (subjects of the day) popularising them with exhibitions and competitions. Reading is encouraged by setting up a good library. The prefect system is well organised.
The challenges faced so bravely by the duo was what made Sujatha unique to be carried forward by his son Lakshman Kuruppu who took over an icon in the field of education. The demise of his father meant a lifetime commitment by him culminating in a wide awakening in education par excellence renowned for its high standards.
Wonderful effort
Lakshman Kuruppu, being young and vibrant, soon after his foreign education, took over Sujatha and opened the door to a new era. He was offered the TOYP award for exceptional academic success and selflessly devoted service to the nation. His dream was to reach the highest level possible. In his mission for the quality education he did succeed and Sujatha today has made her mark in all-around performance island-wide and across the globe.
Sujatha has been a focus of worldwide admiration more so for the unlimited ability and talent of the present management. His work in this sphere is too numerous to be mentioned here in detail. It is to be witnessed by the present generation.
Massive contribution
However, it must be stated that admission to Sujatha has certainly become a major concern. There are many schools to choose from in the vicinity. But the rush is for name Sujatha is nothing strange. He is widely known for his dedication and his massive contribution to his loyal staff cannot be estimated in black and white. The name and fame of Sujatha have spread everywhere so much so that it ranks best among the best performing schools winning acclaim for the best English medium school. Sujatha today has become a household name the entire complex and the Sujathian family found in the above mentioned places is a clear indication of vision and foresight of the determined young manager. This is quite a successful noble mission.
Having just concluded the Golden Jubilee celebrations with much grandeur, the school birthday too is an important celebration in the school calendar. This conveys a deep message to the student generation. It is full of rich culture and history and is truly a learning experience to the present students. This really and truly conveys a deep message to the student generation the historic significance and what Sujatha truly means  a request by the writer who served Sujatha for nearly two decades (1985  2004).
Sujathians, across the globe wherever you are, do respect, revere and salute your Alma Mater unsparingly on this day and ever afterwards.

US travel ban goes to Supreme Court

The White House has asked the US Supreme Court to reinstate a travel ban on people from majority Muslim countries.
The ban has been blocked by lower courts which have said that it is discriminatory.
Two emergency applications have now been filed by the government with the court's nine justices that seek to overturn those lower court rulings.
The controversial ban has prompted protests and debate across the US.
"We have asked the Supreme Court to hear this important case and are confident that President Trump's executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the Nation safe and protect our communities from terrorism," said Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores.
"The President is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism, until he determines that they can be properly vetted and do not pose a security risk to the United States."
Ban 'rooted in religious animus'
Trump's original executive order in January was defeated after a legal challenge initially mounted by Washington state and Minnesota.
He then signed a revised order in March that bars new visas for people from Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen. It also temporarily blocks all refugees.
However, a district court in Maryland found the ban violated constitutional rights and temporarily blocked it.
A federal judge in Hawaii also sided with opponents that the ban was discriminatory and cited "questionable evidence" in the government's argument that the ban was a matter of national security.
Last month,a federal appeals court in Virginiadealt Trump a fresh blow when it refused to lift the temporary block.
It said that the government's national security argument was a "secondary justification for an executive order rooted in religious animus and intended to bar Muslims from this country".
The justice department then said it would seek a Supreme Court review of the appeals verdict.

Ven. Rathana Thera wants national plan for disaster mitigation
The country should have a national plan and policy to mitigate disasters and moreover to protect valuable lives, National Council of Sri Lanka (NCSL) Chairman Ven.Athuraliye Rathana Thera said.
A national plan is vital for disaster mitigation. But as an outcome of not having such a national plan or mechanism in the field of disaster mitigation, the country lost more than 200 lives by the last adverse weather situation, the Thera said.
The Thera said so addressing media yesterday in Colombo.
Ven. Rathana Thera said that if there is a national plan in disaster mitigation, many of the lives could be saved. Therefore, the National Council of Sri Lanka will implement national level disaster mitigation plan within the next six months period, the Thera said. Addressing the media, Ashoka Abeysinghe of the NCSL said that we could taken more effective preacutionary measures against the recent disaster as this was not a random incident.
But, as there isnt such a disaster mitigation plan, we could not protect the country from the disaster, he said.
We dont have a way to store the large volume of rain water. Unlike in the past, there arent many areas to store or collect rain water. The countrys temperature has gone up by 1 C when compared with the 1980s he said. Therefore there should be a national policy in disaster mitigation and adaption, Abeysinghe said. Chris Dharmakirti of the NCSL said that as there was such a disaster mitigation mechanism, people were not informed properly about the vulnerability.
When the sluice gates of the Kukulegamga Reservoir were opened by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) engineers that message was not communicated to the people of the area. If there is a disaster mitigation mechanism, people of the area should be given enough time to save their properties and lives. The people should have been informed by the Disaster Management Centre when the sluice gates were opened, he said.
He said that the country has conducted enough studies and evaluations on disaster management and mitigation but the findings of those studies had not been put into practice. The suggestions and directives of various studies have not been utilised to mitigate disasters. Those findings have not been put into practice in order to mitigate disasters, Dharmakirti said.
