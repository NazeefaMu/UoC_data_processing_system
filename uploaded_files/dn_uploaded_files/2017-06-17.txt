Australia rest Starc, drop O'Keefe for Bangladesh tour
SYDNEY, Friday - Australia have rested paceman Mitchell Starc and dropped left-arm spinner Steve O'Keefe for the upcoming two-test series in Bangladesh, Cricket Australia said on Friday.
Starc featured in Australia's failed Champions Trophy campaign but scans revealed the left-arm paceman has not fully recovered from the foot fracture that cut short his India tour earlier this year.
"Mitchell was due to go for follow-up scans after the Champions Trophy, as part of his recovery plan," physiotherapist David Beakely said after CA named a 13-member squad.
"He will now undertake a period of rest from bowling with the aim to have him return for the one-day series in India in late September as he begins his build up to the Ashes."
Fit-again James Pattinson joined fellow pacemen Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins, while the selectors will name a fourth fast bowler later.
O'Keefe was a notable omission, having taken 12 wickets in the first test in India and finishing as Australia's joint leading wicket-taker in the series, which the hosts won 2-1.
"Whilst Steve O'Keefe bowled well in Pune, he did not maintain this level in the remaining matches of the series..." national selector Trevor Hohns said.
Left-arm spinner Ashton Agar has been asked instead to partner off-spinner Nathan Lyon for the tests in Dhaka (from Aug. 27) and Chittagong (from Sept. 4).
"Ashton has continued to impress us with his form and we believe his bowling is at a level where he deserves to be playing on the highest stage," Hohns said.
"He will work nicely in tandem with Nathan Lyon and also brings a great all-round package to the team."
All-rounder Hilton Cartwright has also been named in the Steve Smith-led squad.
Australia postponed their tour of Bangladesh in 2015 over security concerns but CA executive general manager Pat Howard was satisfied with the assurance from their hosts.
"The Bangladesh Cricket Board and the Bangladesh Government have provided satisfactory levels of assurance and security for this tour to proceed at this stage, and were very grateful to them for this," Howard said.
"We will continue to work with them to finalise plans but also monitor advice from Government agencies and our own security advisors about the security risk."

The Colombo High Court yesterday, permitted the substitution of surety with another in respect of Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera regarding a case filed against him.
The case is for possessing a baby elephant without a valid licence.Filing a motion Ven Dhammaloka Thera made a request to substitute a surety with another. Dhammaloka Thera was released on two sureties of Rs.10 million each on a previous occasion. High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne re-fixed the case for trial on July 12.
This is the first time in Sri Lanka that an accused had been indicted in the High Court by Attorney General over an offence of possessing an elephant without a valid licence following the amendments to the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance in 2009.
The Attorney General filed an indictment against Ven.Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera on two counts for possessing a baby elephant without a valid licence.

Beaten Bangladesh need to get mentally tougher, says Mortaza
BIRMINGHAM, Thursday - Bangladesh found India a step too far in the Champions Trophy semi-final on Thursday, losing by nine wickets with nearly ten overs to spare, and skipper Mashrafe Mortaza said they needed to toughen up mentally.
Bangladesh made 264 for seven in their 50 overs but then never came close to worrying India's impressive upper order batsmen.
It was the first time that the Tigers had reached the last four of a major tournament but Mortaza was in no mood for self-congratulation.
Yeah, obviously the boys should feel pride, but I think in a tournament like this, you have to be, I think, physically or skill-wise at your peak, he said.
Yes, we are coming up still. We need to learn so many things. But I think we need to be a little bit more ready mentally for playing this sort of match.
There was no sign of lack of focus from Tamim Iqbal (70) or Mushfiqur Rahim (61) as they put on a third wicket partnership of 123.
But both were removed playing wild shots to occasional off-spinner Kedar Jadhav and their departure led to a major loss of momentum.
The weakest part of Bangladesh's performance was with the ball where, not only did they only pick up one wicket, but they failed to put any real pressure on India.
We have to learn a bit more, how to stop runs on that sort of wicket. We can't just be hoping to take wickets all the time, especially against a batting order like India. So I know we have to learn a little bit more how can we stop runs and put pressure on the opponent, Mortaza said.
While there is plenty of room for improvement, the final group stage win over New Zealand will remain as a highlight of the tournament for Bangladesh.  Agencies

Confidence on Wiggie: TNA split
Talks between Sampanthan, Wigneswaran fail:
Hartal in favour of wiggie :
suresh for wiggie, suma says no:
A possible split within the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) has become apparent as negotiations between TNA Leader R. Sampanthan and Northern Provincial Council Chief Minister of C.V. Wigneswaran over a compromise has fallen through.
As a result, hartals organised by the Tamil Peoples Council (TPC) in support of Wigneswaran which were put on hold in lieu of the negotiations, went ahead yesterday.
Sources state that Sampanthan had asked Wigneswaran to allow the two ministers; Balasubramaniam Deniswaran and Dr. Pathmanathan Sathiyalingam, who were exonerated by the committee appointed to investigate them, to continue work, pending a fresh investigation. Earlier Thambyrajah Gurukularajah and Ponnuthurai Ayngaranesan were removed from their posts after being found guilty.
Wigneswaran had called for a fresh investigation despite the committees ruling. The Chief Minister however, it is learnt has rejected the ITAK offer and has stated that he will go ahead with the investigations.
EPRLF Leader and TNA member Suresh Premachandran in the meantime insisted that the ITAK had taken an unnecessary stance to remove the Chief Minister from office.
This is opposed by half of the Provincial Council members; TNA constituent parties like the EPRLF, TELO and PLOT are against it, he said.
I dont understand why the ITAK wants to remove the Chief Minister. The Chief Minister has taken steps to remove the corrupt ministers. But the ITAK wants to keep them as ministers. This is completely opposed by the Tamil people. There was a big rally from Nallur Temple up to the Chief Ministers house today (16) and the public said they would be with him,added Premachandran.
He further explained that they also held hartals in Vavuniya and Kilinochchi in protest. Reports coming in from Vavuniya however indicate that no protest was held there as many had not got the message in time. Meetings had been held on Thursday over a possible hartal but none had communicated the message clearly to the businessmen in town.
Premachandran further explained that, If the ITAK did not withdraw the No-Confidence Motion, it would be a difficult thing and while discussions were to be held with the TNA leader, There was no feedback from Sampanthan.
At present he said they were trying to persuade the ITAK to withdraw the petition but failing which, They would be forced to fight it out in the Council,he said.
The former TNA Parliamentarian said on Thursday night, 15 council members had submitted their affidavits in support of Wigneswaran and he expected two more to support them.
The Council made up of 38 members has the TNA occupying 30 seats; ITAK 15, EPRLF 5, TELO 6, PLOT 3 and the Good Governance Front holding 1 seat. The Opposition has the UPFA (EPDP, ACMC and SLFP) with 7 seats and the SLMC 1 seat.
The ITAK motion of no-confidence thus far has secured 21 signatures which includes 15 from the ITAK, 2 from EPDP, 3 from the ACMC and 1 from the SLMC. The SLFP has chosen to remain neutral in this struggle, it is learnt.
The Chief Minister has the majority within the ruling party but they are having support with the Opposition, said Premachandran.
ITAK member Ayoop Asmin speaking to Daily News however said that the group in support of Wigenswaran were counting their 15 having included the Chief Minister himself, They cannot technically count the Chief Minister here. They only have 14,he said.
TNA Spokesperson M.A.Sumanthiran in the meantime speaking to IBC Tamil Network in a video posted on the official TNA twitter account said action against the Chief Minister needed to be taken and that the latters recent statements and actions were unforgiveable.
It was our leader Sampanthan and I who suggested that Wignesawaran be chosen as Chief Minister and it was through the TNA that he became the Chief Minister. But he has not said a word in support of the part and instead has worked against it.
I did tell the party hierarchy that action needs to be taken against him but then the leadership was of the belief that given the hardships faced by the people, we must tolerate his actions. So I remained silent,Sumanthiran said.
But, his recent actions too have become problematic and I am of the stance that it has become unforgiveable,Sumanthiran added.

Dishonest displays and truthful socialists
Democratic people in this country are deeply concerned and worried about the recent continuing agitation and violence perpetrated against innocent women and men in Muslim and Christian communities in Lanka. We are told that 25 such attacks were made in the period April 16 to June 9. These were spread throughout the country. One can imagine the fear and hurt generated in the Muslim community in particular by these callous attacks. In the last few weeks pogroms have spread to cover Christian community too.
The entire population of Lanka should also be agitated and acutely aware of how easily these matters can explode out of control, as the history has shown again and again. Following hate speeches by fringe groups and a few religious leaders, a new wave of violence against Muslims and Christians in Lanka has been unleashed. Firstly number of mosques, homes and business enterprises owned by Muslims has been attacked. Attacks on Christian religious centres followed in the last few weeks. These events during April to June are extremely distressing and detrimental to national unity and harmony.
People thought the tragic memory of being torn apart by national conflict for over three decades in Sri Lanka is just beginning to fade. It is not easy. We have to defeat this vulgar attempt by a small minority to try to take us back to civil strife and even war. Public campaigns in the name of religion or nationality that pit religious or national communities against each other through hate speech and violence, threaten the prospects for meaningful reconciliation and national unity.
Religious freedom, harmony and co-existence
They must be resisted and replaced by a culture of religious freedom, harmony and co-existence. A particularly provocative and dangerous majoritist strand of thought running through this politics of hate and harm, is the assumption that the numerical majority - be it in terms of nationality and/or religion - is entitled to privileges and rights above those enjoyed by other citizens. This has serious and damaging implications for the future of Lanka as a united and functioning democracy, based on the rule of law and the equality of all of its citizens before the law.
Moreover, it flies in the face of the dream of pluralism given by the Yahapalanaya. We were told that peoples of multiple identities who enrich and enhance our countrys potential in every sphere, will be successful. They will come together too, to protect our pluralism and diversity and to celebrate them as sources of great strength to our collective well-being. Is it just a liberal dream
As patriotic citizens and organisations, we are alarmed by the increase in the number of acts of violence perpetrated against Muslims and Christians in this country. Since 2015, although the incidence of religious violence has decreased, it has not been completely eliminated as the statistics show. In recent months we are alarmed to note a resurgence of such religious hostilities both in acts of violence and speech.
We are equally alarmed that the government has not acted swiftly, decisively and proactively to curb this disturbing trend and call on the government and the law
enforcement authorities to protect the right to freedom of religion of all groups in this country. This has been a historic tradition in Lankan society. It is also a universal principle and an intrinsic part of all democratic societies. Violence and hate speech should be prosecuted and the Police and Attorney General's Department should ensure that the rule of law is strictly observed and the law applied without discrimination.
Law enforcement officers will act when there is a clear message given by the political leadership. We ask the political leadership of this country including the President, the Prime Minister, and the Ministers of Justice and Law and Order, to issue clear instructions to those enforcing the law to prosecute violence and hate speech without fear or favour. We call on the Leader of the Opposition and of all political parties to strictly avoid any diversion of their political activities and discourse into communal hostilities and the targeting of particular religions, stated one campaign document.
Fascistic racist politics
While we are fighting barbaric social tendencies left behind by the fascistic Mahinda regime, there is a trend, spread all over the world that wants to challenge the rise of fascistic racist politics. Latter came to lime light with the election of Donald Trump. Nobody expected the rise of Bernard Sanders as a radical socialist; he was an American politician who has been the junior United States Senator from Vermont since 2007. Sanders's campaign against Hillary Clinton for the party's 2016 U.S. presidential nomination projected him to be a new kind of socialist. He was helped by small women and men. A self-described democratic socialist, Sanders is pro-labor and emphasizes reversing economic inequality. Some say he is not a socialist and consider his views to be more in line with social democracy and New Deal-era American progressivism than democratic socialism. However while a student he was an active protest organiser for the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee during the Civil Rights Movement.
Sanders rose to national prominence after his 2010 filibuster against the Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2010, which extended the Bush tax cuts that favoured the wealthiest Americans. He has built a reputation as a leading progressive voice on issues such as campaign finance reform, corporate welfare, global warming, income inequality, LGBT rights, parental leave, and universal healthcare. Sanders has long been critical of U.S. foreign policy and was an early and outspoken opponent of the Iraq War, the First Gulf War, and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua.
He is also outspoken on civil liberties and civil rights, criticizing racial discrimination in the criminal justice system as well as advocating for privacy rights against mass surveillance policies such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the NSA surveillance programmes. All these put together he was often classified as a Marxist!
There are several political leaders who have challenged fascistic trends in their own political arenas. Several in Europe, but the emergence of Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the UKs Labour Party, is most significant. He has made a remarkable comeback. His political obituary had been written by reactionary critiques and widely accepted even a few weeks ago. Tories, led by Theresa May, will still have the largest number of seats. But they have lost their majority, after calling the election in the belief that they would increase it. Surprisingly, Labour has picked up at least 29 seats. The result is a hung parliament. Observers have pointed to various historical causes that have brought Corbyn to his leadership position and kept him there, such as the failure of the centrist, neoliberal project of New Labour to provide economic security or even much of a future for the partys working class base; or Tony Blairs deeply unpopular foreign policy, including the Iraq War and the lies on which it was sold. Point they want make is Corbyn is not the cause of his victory!
On the other hand, many have made the comparison to Bernie Sanders, who despite losing his primary bid last year is currently the most popular active politician in the US, and is especially well-liked among younger people. The appeal of these two senior citizens to youth is striking, and it bodes well for the future. But one of the most important lessons of the Corbyn comeback is that the truth, so often dismissed as the first casualty of politics, can be an effective weapon. After the Manchester terrorist attack, Corbyn said something that no party leader in the US would say during an election campaign:
Many experts, including professionals in our intelligence and security services, have pointed to the connections between wars our government has supported or fought in other countries and terrorism here at home. Corbyn too opposed UK involvement in the wars in Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq, and Syria. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a man similar to Trump responded saying that Corbyns statement was absolutely monstrous and that it was extraordinary and inexplicable in this week of all weeks that there should be any attempt to justify or to legitimate the actions of terrorists in this way.
But these dishonest attacks, echoed by some of the UKs largest media outlets, didnt stick because people knew that Corbyn was telling the truth. A poll this week for The Independent in the UK found 75 percent in agreement that interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya have made atrocities on UK soil more likely.
There is an important lesson here: the only way to prevent perpetuating, the cycle of terrorism and foreign military intervention is to explain to people what is actually happening. President Obama actually said it for a few seconds in an interview with Vice News back in March 2015: ISIL is direct outgrowth of al-Qaeda in Iraq, which grew out of our invasion. Thus the truthful socialist world trend has started against the dishonest display of Trump and Putin. Lanka is one of the earliest to challenge fascistic politics with a victory to democracy. Still Lanka is fighting and struggle is not yet over. We expect the new trend will deliver better leaders in Lanka too!

DMM urged to launch drought relief programme in Apura
Anuradhapura District Secretary R.M Wanninayaka has urged the Disaster Management Ministry (DMM) to launch a drought relief programme in the Anuradhapura district.
He requested the ministry to allocate funds and implement a food supply drive to help the drought affected.
Wanninayaka said 124,500 people in the district have been affected by the drought. He said the 2017 Yala season has been a failure. In some areas in the district such as Mahavilachchiya, Mahakandarawa, Rambeewa and Mihintale, farmers have been unable to cultivate in three seasons due to the lack of water, he said.

Endless hours of toil paved way for Sangakkaras style
In a beautiful piece in these pages three weeks ago, Michael Henderson wrote about watching Kumar Sangakkara score a hundred at Lords on the day the great Sri Lankans portrait was unveiled there.
The piece was as lyrical as Sangakkaras batting, and Henderson nailed his colours firmly to the mast: Style, no less than statistical achievement, counts for something in any estimation of greatness.
He compared Sangakkara with Jacques Kallis, the South African all-rounder, one of only a handful of men to have scored more Test runs, and his considered view was that anyone still in retention of their marbles would not watch the robotic Kallis before the elegant Sangakkara. Some folk may exist, he wrote, but they are usually to be found muttering to themselves on buses. Henderson is not among their number.
Has appreciation of sport become more utilitarian in recent times Possibly, and possibly because of the professionalisation of sport, which glorifies the ends over the means. Maybe, too, because of the growth of data as a method of validation. Tom Harrison, chief executive of the ECB, was picked up for his comments earlier in the season about his desire to see the England team prioritising style over substance precisely because it is so unusual to hear that message in modern sport, where the bottom line counts for everything. The glory game has become just a game.
For myself, a key element in assessing greatness is the element of risk. I recall talking to John Woodcock, the former cricket correspondent of this newspaper, about great batsmen and agreeing with his assessment that the greats took calculated risks to subjugate bowlers. It is not enough to wear them down, Boycott-style. His was a plea to Joe Root not to change his jaunty, optimistic way of playing, and he hoped that the captaincy would not burden him unduly. We shall see.
By any and every estimation  pure numbers, ease on the eye, or the ability to take calculated risks to win matches  Sangakkara is a great player, having made bundles of runs in all conditions, all around the world. On Tuesday, playing for Surrey again after a stint in the commentary box, he added another notch to a bedpost scarred with statistical milestones when he scored the 100th hundred of his professional career  61 of them in first-class cricket and 39 in list A (one-day) cricket. It is not the ultimate hundreds milestone to celebrate, like the one achieved most recently, and possibly for the last time, by Mark Ramprakash, whereby all 100 were made in first-class cricket.
The changing nature of the calendar means that the modern player will have less chance of emulating the 24 other players who achieved what Ramprakash did, but nevertheless Sangakkaras achievement is noteworthy, especially as it was in a winning cause.
But enough of the numbers, it is the style and elegance, the rhythm and flow of his batting that is under analysis here. Dont for one minute think because he makes batting look easy, that it is easy. For an indication of the amount of toil and sweat that goes into making batting look that easy, lets turn to Paul Farbrace, now Englands assistant coach, formerly coach of Sri Lanka.
Farbrace tells a story about his time working with Sri Lanka. How, during a net session, Sangakkara had asked the coach a question about the movements of his back foot before a ball was bowled. In practice, Sangakkara was very particular about his back foot, wanting it to move across from middle and leg stump to middle and off stump. Not back and across, mind, nor forward  just across.
Farbrace hadnt been watching closely enough and fobbed Sangakkara off with a vague reply, based on the way Sangakkara had been hitting balls nicely in the middle of the bat, the kind of reply that he hoped would pass unnoticed.
Sangakkara later gave him a ticking off: Farbrace, he knew, had not been honest with him about where his foot was moving and had not been watching carefully enough. It was time to sharpen up. It is a small anecdote that tells you a lot about what has made Sangakkara successful: a constant drive, determination and desire to improve, minute attention to detail and a willingness to work endlessly on technique in practice so that, come the match, a more natural, flowing and rhythmical player could emerge and flourish.
Years before, Sangakkara had made that small change to his back-foot movement, from back and across to simply across. It had taken him six to eight months of solid practice before it had become ingrained and natural, so that his foot would move into position, in other words, without conscious thought.
For Sangakkara, rhythm and flow is everything but flow only comes as a result of unconscious rather than conscious thought.
This insight was gleaned from him by another writer in this parish, Simon Hughes, who, remarkably for a useless batsman, wrote an insightful book on batting. In it, he quotes Sangakkaras principles of batsmanship: I dont want to go in to bat worrying about technique because technique is something that is a base, but when you are playing that has to disappear  youve got to be instinctive, reactive, unthinking.
The moment you see technique obviously in someone whos batting, I think thats when someones not really flowing. When everything is flowing, you dont see technique, you see style, you see grace, and you see timing. Thats what I work towards.
I dont want to be fiddling or worrying about where my backlift is going, or whether my foot is going to the ball, or how balanced I am. I just want that flow . . . everything has to be instinctive in the match. The moment you think, it slows you down.
The flow and elegance is what so beguiled Henderson that day at Lords, and so beguiled the folk at Headingley this week, as he added another hundred to his tally. Rhythm, flow, elegance, style. All earned, though, through hours of sweat and toil. When batting looks as easy as that, you can be sure it is an illusion.
Tongue in cheek it might have been, but Darren Lehmanns parting quip about only learning from England when they have won a World Cup carried an important truth: when it comes to cricket, Australia think they have a monopoly on knowledge.
So when, two years ago during the previous home Ashes series, I heard a number of Australian players praising a foreign coach who had worked in Sydney for some time, my ears pricked up.
Since Australians tend to shower praise upon only their own kind, this was unusual enough to make a mental note and store it away.
The name of the coach Chandika Hathurusingha, who had begun to broaden his coaching horizons with New South Wales as assistant coach to Trevor Bayliss after a stint in his homeland, Sri Lanka. He now coaches Bangladesh.Like many of the best coaches, Hathurusingha was a modest international player, a stodgy batsman and sometime medium-paced nagging bowler, someone who had to work hard to rise to the highest level and knew what it took to get the best out of his limited resources.
That is exactly what he has been doing with Bangladesh for the past three years, increasing their winning percentage from 29 to 56 in all one-day internationals, taking Test scalps from Sri Lanka and England, and increasing the respect with which they are held.
Ive known him a long time, since we played against each other for our respective under-19 national teams in 1987. His softly spoken and gentle presence camouflages a keen cricket brain and determination to succeed. Underestimate Hathurusinghas Bangladesh at your peril.

Englands bad day comes at worst possible time
For all of the good limited-overs cricket that England have played over the past two years, we know they are capable of some pretty bad days.
It was just over two weeks ago that they found themselves 20-6 against South Africa. The odd collapse must be expected in this era of ultra-aggressive batting.
The Champions Trophy semi-final defeat by Pakistan, an eight-wicket hammering, was one of those bad days.
England simply did not know what was a good total on a used Cardiff surface. As a result, they chased an impossible dream and fell well short.
The problems for Eoin Morgans men began the day before this match. They were clearly concerned about the pitch and talked about it a lot on Tuesday.
Each venue is only permitted to use three different pitches for the tournament, so that is why an old one was used for the semi-final. You wonder why that rule is in place, but that is not to make an excuse for England. They allowed it to get into their minds.
We were all surprised when Pakistan choose to bowl first - normal cricketing logic says you bat first in these circumstances, knowing that surface will get slower and harder to bat on.
However, the counter to that is fielding first means you dont have to worry about calculating what a good score might be. You simply have to chase what the opposition make. That is exactly what Pakistan did.
England were well placed at 128-2, but batted themselves into a hole.
Morgan maybe felt they were behind and played a rash shot; Ben Stokes wasnt able to play with freedom because wickets were falling around him. The hosts were completely squeezed by brilliant Pakistan bowling and fielding.
When England came out to field, they knew they had no other option than to bowl Pakistan out. They pushed and pushed, and that can lead to some loose bowling. In those situations, well-laid plans can quickly go out of the window, which is part of the reason why the game sped away.
DO ENGLAND HAVE A PROBLEM IN CRUNCH GAMES
And so England go out of a tournament they looked well placed to win. They had all bases covered: powerful batting and a bowling attack full of variety and wicket-takers - a team of match-winners. They will be bitterly disappointed. Plenty of times before, England teams have had chances to end the hunt for a global 50-over trophy, a search that goes back to 1975. On this occasion, like the near-misses that have gone before, England failed to click when it mattered most.
Recently, England lost the 2013 Champions Trophy final and the 2016 World T20 final, two games they had the chance to win. Now this.
Are they developing a problem in crunch contests I dont think so. Indeed, it is an achievement for them to be getting to these knockout matches, especially after the shambolic World Cup campaign two years ago. They will now set their sights on the 2019 World Cup, where once again they will be the hosts.
Two years out, they look in good shape to do well in that tournament. Most of this squad will still be around and the England hierarchy will want Morgan to remain in the job, even if Joe Root is about to take over as Test captain. Some skippers want to be in charge of the whole lot, but Morgan has done a good job and is batting well.
ELECTRIC PAKISTAN DESERVE THEIR PRAISE
England will dissect this defeat, but huge credit must go to Pakistan, a team transformed from the one humbled by India in their first game.
Just as the nature of one-day cricket can see a very good side like England fall flat, so too can a team rise from nowhere to potential champions.
Their bowling was terrific, led by the pace of Hasan Ali, who is fully deserving of his place as the tournaments leading wicket-taker.
He is in your face and aggressive, backed up by the left-armers of Junaid Khan and the precocious leg-spin of 18-year-old Shadab Khan.
Another left-armer, Rumman Raes, came in and performed excellently on his ODI debut, perhaps helped by the fact that England had never seen him before.
Pakistan are so mercurial, you often look to their fielding as a sign of where the team is at. In Cardiff, after some tough drops, they were electric, most notably Fakhar Zamans catch to dismiss Moeen Ali - watch the video above - and substitute Ahmed Shehzads run-out of Adil Rashid.
And, with the bat, the attacked the new ball, because that was the best time to look to score runs. In the end, they romped to victory.
They have picked themselves up after that loss to India, upset world number ones South Africa, eked past Sri Lanka in order to make the semi-finals and have now dumped out the hosts and favourites.
They will go to Sundays final full of confidence. Most would probably like that final to be against India, but a clash against Bangladesh comes with a similar amount of historical meaning.
Pakistan matches against either India or Bangladesh do not come too often outside of these events.
Its disappointing that England will not be in that final, but the occasion will not be harmed by their absence.

Fan dies after June 3 football stampede in Turin
Rome,Friday: A woman left in a coma after a crowd stampeded in Turin at a screening of the Champions League final on June 3 died overnight, the hospital where she was being treated said Friday.
The patient, identified as Erika, a 38-year-old local woman who had come to watch the match with her boyfriend, was among more than 1,500 people injured in the panic.
There were around 30,000 people in San Carlo square at the time, who had gathered to watch home favourites Juventus play Real Madrid in the Welsh city of Cardiff.
The stampede was apparently triggered by fireworks which were detonated as the match drew to a close.
Two other people were seriously injured, including a seven-year-old boy, who was also left in a coma but is now recovering.
Some of the injuries occurred after a railing around the entrance to an underground car park beneath the square gave way, causing some of those injured to fall up to two metres (nearly seven feet).
Erika was crushed against a wall, and the compression of her rib cage caused a heart attack that led to brain damage, the media reported.
The mayor of Turin, Chiara Appendino, said in a tweet that "words were insufficient" to describe the death, and that the city would officially observe mourning on the day of her funeral.
The Italian authorities opened an investigation for involuntary bodily harm immediately after the incident, which will now be upgraded to involuntary homicide.AFP

Former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, considered the architect of Germanys reunification, died at the age of 87 yesterday.
German media reported Kohl died at his home in Ludwigshafen.
Kohl led Germany from 1982 to 1998. In addition to bringing East and West Germany back together after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the former chancellor also played a significant role in the introduction of the euro.
Working closely with my very good friend to help achieve a peaceful end to the Cold War and unification of Germany within NATO will remain one of the great jobs of my jobs, former President George H.W. Bush said in a statement on Kohls death. Throughout our endeavors, Helmut was a rock  both steady and strong. We mourn his loss today, even as we know his remarkable life will inspire future generations of leaders to dare and achieve greatly.
Kohl had been holidaying in the south when the devastating tsunami struck, killing more than 30,000 Lankans.
The Helmut Kohl Foundation provided funding for the Karapitiya Maternity hospital in Galle after theMahamodara hospital was devastated following the tsunami in 2004.
As a true friend of Sri Lanka, Kohl had visited Sri Lanka frequently for holiday since his retirement from office. He had directly intervened to secure more than Rs.500 milion for the construction of the hospital.

Forty two Indian fishing boats to be released on several conditions
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said, the government has decided to release 42 Indian fishing boats on several conditions.
The Minister made this announcement at the fisheries advisory council meeting held at the ministry auditorium on Thursday. Over 140 Indian fishing vessels were taken into custody by the Sri Lanka Navy for fishing in the Sri Lankan territorial water using bottom-trawling.
All attempts made by both governments for over 35 years to solve this issue have been futile.
Minister Amaraweera added, these fishing vessels are released on the condition that they will never enter countrys territorial water again.
The number of Indian fishing vessels trespassing Sri Lankan maritime boundary has dropped by 50 percent, following a number of measures adopted by the Indian government, he said.
Minister Amaraweera said, India has suspended issuing of licences for fishing boats. Over 200 fishing boats which were engaged in bottom-trawling have been converted to multiday fishing boats to fish in the deep sea, he added.

Fowler surges clear as big-hitters flop at US Open
Erin, Friday: Rickie Fowler produced a record-equalling low-scoring round to take a one-shot lead at the US Open on Thursday as the big-hitters failed to fire.
Fowler, the world number nine from California, revelled in benign conditions at Erin Hills Golf Course to reel off seven birdies and 11 pars in a superb 65.
The 28-year-old's seven-under-par total matched the lowest to par score ever carded in the opening round of a US Open, a record shared by Jack Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf since the 1980 tournament.
With the picturesque par-72 course set up at a monstrous 7,845 yards, Erin Hills had been expected to live up to the US Open's billing of being the toughest test in golf.
But heavy rain, which has softened greens and made fairways more forgiving, levelled the playing field dramatically.
Fowler wasted no time in exploiting the conditions after teeing off on the 10th, rattling off four quick birdies to be four under.
Three more birdies on his inward nine took him to seven under and a piece of US Open history.
"It's cool, but it's just the first round," Fowler said afterwards.
"It is always cool to be part of some sort of history in golf. But I'd rather be remembered for something that's done on Sunday."
Fowler leads by one shot from England's Paul Casey and lowly-ranked American Xander Schauffele.
Casey carded an eagle and six birdies for a six-under-par 66 while Schauffele, the 23-year-old world number 352 also carded a 66.
Yet while Fowler and Casey thrived, defending champion Dustin Johnson, world number two Rory McIlroy and world number three Jason Day -- three big-hitters who had been tipped to thrive -- all had a day to forget.
Johnson blamed an errant putter for his three-over-par 75, which included a double-bogey and two bogeys.
"I just didn't putt very well," Johnson said. "I missed a lot of really good opportunities. That was the big key for me."
McIlroy, who is returning to action after a rib injury, opened with an early eagle but was unable to maintain his momentum and finished with a six-over-par 78.
"Just timing was a little bit off, and that was it," McIlroy said.
"Just really bad tee shots which led to obviously not being able to give myself many looks for birdies."
Day meanwhile was left sliding towards an early exit after a calamitous seven-over-par 79.
With Johnson, McIlroy and Day misfiring, it was left to a clutch of unheralded players to dominate the upper reaches of the leaderboard.
Three players -- Brian Harman, Tommy Fleetwood and Brooks Koepka -- were in the clubhouse on five under, two back from Fowler.
Masters champion Sergio Garcia meanwhile was lurking five off the lead after a two-under-par 70.
Garcia carded an eagle, three birdies and three bogeys in a roller coaster round.
Former US Open champion Ernie Els chose the 20th anniversary of his last victory in the tournament to remind fans that he is not quite ready to be put out to grass.
The 47-year-old South African posted a two-under-par 71. His round would have been better had it not been for two bogeys in his closing holes. AFP

Garbage issue not my ministrys responsibility: Patali
The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry or the Urban Development Authority has nothing to do with the garbage issue although it is the worst affected institution with the issue, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday.
He said garbage has been dumped in the lands of the Urban Development Authority such as in Bloemendhal and Meethotamulla where several deaths occurred due to the recent collapse.
He added that those who are responsible for that incident should be sentenced to death since it was such a grave crime.
He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the Ministry Auditorium in Suhurupaya, Battaramulla inauguration ceremony of the Nikasala Purawara (Garbage Free City) project.
Minister Ranawaka also said Local Government institutions including the Provincials and the Pradeshiya Sabahs should take responsibility.
"However, the Meethotamulla garbage issue initiated with the Supreme Court intervening to solve the garbage issue by ordering the dumping of garbage there for six months by the then Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva," Minister Ranawaka said. "Thereafter, it was extended to two years and then continued until the collapse took place. Finally, three million tons of garbage was dumped there in an area of 21 acres which is worth more than Rs 1,100 million. At last, no body dared to take the responsibility of the catastrophe."
Minister Ranawaka further said that media personnel had reported a person claiming that they had means to export garbage even to the United Kingdom. "I challenge those people to export even a single kilogramme of garbage to UK," Minister Ranawaka challenged. "If they could do so, I would resign from my ministerial portfolio tomorrow."
Megapolis and Western Development Ministry Secretary Nihal Rupasinghe and Garbage Management Project Director Jayavilal Fernando were present.

A global effort
The recent floods and landslides that caused the deaths of over 200 people in several districts also led to a massive economic loss. A large number of houses and infrastructure facilities such as roads, bridges, school buildings etc have been destroyed. The repair bill is estimated at over Rs.8,000 million. The Government plans to finance this massive venture through the Insurance Trust Fund.
While it is indeed essential to undertake rehabilitation and repairs, we need to take a holistic approach to the whole issue. There is an urgent need for a comprehensive flood prevention programme in all vulnerable districts. It is also important to equip the Meteorology Department, the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) and the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau with the latest, highly sophisticated equipment, along with advanced training here and abroad for their personnel. An effective awareness and early warning system (of the type that already exists for tsunamis) is also essential, boosted by further research into the effects of climate change on Sri Lankas fragile ecosystems.
These projects will cost an enormous amount of money that we will not be able to afford using our own finances. Sri Lanka did receive a massive quantum of foreign aid in cash and kind following the recent disaster, but those are generally reserved for immediate relief activities. These funds and goods cannot be used for long-term projects.
The obvious solution is to pitch our case to the wider donor community. Special Assignment Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama says the Government has planned to hold a donor conference with immediate effect aiming to fulfill financial needs and finding a permanent solution to the flood problem. The venue of the donor conference has not been finalized yet and it could be held here or abroad.
According to the Minister, the idea of holding a donor conference was mooted by President Maithripala Sirisena at the last Cabinet meeting, with the aim of finding a lasting solution to the damage and destruction caused by floods and landslides in a few districts from time to time, including Ratnapura, Kalutara and Galle districts. The Cabinet has wholeheartedly endorsed his timely proposal.
There is a precedent for this, though the circumstances were difficult. Sri Lankas last donor conference was held in Tokyo, Japan aimed at reconstruction and rehabilitation of war-torn areas. A sum of nearly US$ 4 billion was pledged at this conference, but this was not properly realised as the conflict started again.
Now Sri Lanka has a second chance to build back better as many more Western and Asian countries are willing to help. The Helping Hambantota saga that came to light in the aftermath of the tsunami as well as a hostile attitude towards friendly Western nations that was in evidence during the previous regime put off many countries which were otherwise willing to help Sri Lanka.
Today, thanks to the good work of President Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera on the international stage, Sri Lanka has earned the good name of the international community. With the new Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake ably following in their footsteps, there is no question of Sri Lankas standing in the international community. Several countries have already indicated their willingness to assist Sri Lankas efforts to ward off climatic disasters. The proposed donor conference will bring all such parties under one roof. We hope that the conference will address preparedness for other types of disaster as well, including forest fires and earthquakes.
There is every indication that the donor conference could be held within the next two months. A three member committee has already been appointed by the President to work out the details. Accordingly, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake and Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama have been appointed to the committee. The committee will submit proposals to the donor conference, where the proposals will be considered by the donor countries.
According to Minister Amunugama, the project proposals prepared on a district or electoral basis provide permanent suggestions to control floods. The aid may be either financial or technological. Just to give an idea of the scale of projects needed to prevent and control floods, US$ 300 million will be needed for the proposed flood control project of Kalu Ganga alone. Under the proposed Kalu Ganga project, three dams are to be constructed at Malwala, Dela in the Ratnapura district. There are also separate proposals to control floods in other districts based on the Nilwala Ganga and Kalu Ganga. Clearly, Sri Lanka cannot afford to implement multiple projects of this nature simultaneously.
In any case, international cooperation is the way forward to combat climate change and its disastrous effects. The Paris Accord on Climate Change is one such international instrument that brings nations together. Rich countries have to do more to combat the harmful effects of climate change and also assist developing nations in this regard. Perhaps the Sri Lanka donor conference will be the first such initiative that is certain to spur wider North-South Cooperation on natural disasters and climate change.

Hamilton aims to emulate Federer and Djokovic
In battle for F1 title:
Lewis Hamilton wants to emulate the tennis players he admires  Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic  by delivering consistent results in his attempt to win the Formula One world championship after his intense battle with Sebastian Vettel to win the Canadian Grand Prix. The British driver, who now trails Vettel by 12 points, said that their relationship remained one that was respectful but with a hard, competitive edge.
Always a happy hunting ground for Hamilton, the Canadian Grand Prix was once again conquered by the British driver but his skill was rewarded to a much greater extent than merely claiming his sixth win at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. While Hamilton led from pole to flag in a race in which he never relinquished control and followed the Mercedes teams plan to perfection, his Formula One world championship rival Sebastian Vettel endured a trying afternoon from which he did well to manage a strong comeback. But it remained a major blow, the Germans fourth-place finish cutting his 25-point advantage over Hamilton to 12.
What I loved about the race with Sebastian is I love tennis and I love watching Federer and Djokovic in the final and what I really admire is consistency, he said. I admire their concentration and how they are so awesome and stay at the limit. I felt I had that battle on Sunday.
Hamilton believes it is an approach he needs to take to the season as a whole. For me it is about consistency, he said. You can get ahead for one race and be behind in the next. It is about trying to perform as I have this weekend at every single race we have left. That is what I am thinking about. It doesnt matter if I am leading the championship after the next race what matters is if I am leading the championship after the last race.
His comments reflect how seriously he takes the fight with Vettel and that he expects it to be maintained throughout the season.
I love a tough fight and I love a challenge. He was respectful and still that respect stayed the same at the end. We are never going to be happy finishing second. If he finished second and was happy, I would be concerned.

I meant no harm to journalist, says John
Complaint to HRC baseless:
Tourism and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga yesterday reiterated his claim that he meant no harm to Ja-ela journalist Bennet Ferdinandez and that his complaint to the Human Rights Council (HRC) was baseless.
On June 8, the Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Affairs had allegedly threatened the journalist when he was questioned over the issue of dumping garbage in Muthurajawela.
The journalist had lodged a complaint against the Minister for having threatened his life at the Peliyagoda Police, the very same day. On Tuesday (13), he had proceeded to file a petition with the Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission over the very same issue.
I did not invite the media to cover the discussion at my home.I wanted to resolve this with the people in electorate in an amicable manner. The media is insinuating that I asked people to dump garbage there and that is false. There is a gazette from the President directing that garbage be dumped there as Meethotamulla cannot be used anymore, Amaratunga said.
The Minister was addressing a media briefing at Sirikotha yesterday.
He added that he did not want to respond to the journalists questions as he thought the former was trying to stir up more trouble on the matter.
My patience is limited. I did not want to scold him but he provoked me. I did not threaten him but I did use some foul language and I am sorry for that, the minister said.
Amaratunga further explained that the journalist had no need to go to the HRC as no harm had been done to him.
We are all aware that certain people blow up such incidents out of proportion to be able to seek asylum out of the country at a later date, the minister alleged as he went on to explain that the media needed to behave with more decorum.
The journalist had been a regular correspondent from the area and well known to the Minister. He had also been covering the event for over an hour prior to the Ministers outburst. I know what he is like and I dont like his actions, Minister Amaratunga.

India openers inspire Kohli ahead of Pakistan final
BIRMINGHAM, Thursday  India captain Virat Kohli heads into a Champions Trophy final against arch-rivals Pakistan back on top of the one-day international batting rankings.
But the star batsman insists it is the form of the title-holders opening duo that is giving him confidence in the lead up to Sundays clash between the sub-continent cricket giants at the Oval.
The 28-year-old Kohli is also top of the tournament batting averages with a scarcely credible mark of 253 -- a figure that owes much to the fact that three of his four innings so far have been not outs.
Kohli was undefeated again as India crushed Bangladesh by nine wickets in a commanding semi-final victory at Edgbaston -- the venue where they won the 2013 Champions Trophy title -- on Wednesday.
His 96 not out saw Kohli end the match with nearly 10 overs to spare by hitting a four off Sabbir Rahman.
But Rohit Sharma was 123 not out at the other end, having shared an unbroken stand of 178 with his skipper.
By the time Kohli came in, however, India were well on their way to chasing down a modest victory target of 265 thanks to a brisk opening partnership of 87 between Sharma and left-hander Shikhar Dhawan, who made 46.
Im really enjoying the way Im batting, Kohli told reporters.
For me the number of runs do not matter at this stage. Im really enjoying the process.
The way Rohit and Shikhar batted, it just gave me so much confidence heading out of the changing room. Those two guys really dent the opposition mentally, he explained.
That India had a below par total to chase owed much to Kohlis decision to bring on unheralded spinner Kedar Jadhav.
He only had six ODI wickets prior to this match yet dismissed both Bangladesh top-scorers Tamim Iqbal (70) and Mushfiqur Rahim (61) on his way to figures of two for 22 in six overs.
The Tigers third-wicket duo had given India something to think about while adding 123 but once they were both out the innings fell away.
He bowled really well, credit to him, said Kohli of Jadhav.
He doesnt bowl much in the nets, but hes a smart cricketer.
He knows where the batsmen get into trouble, and if you can think like a batter when youre bowling, its obviously a bit of an advantage to any bowler.
India will now finish the tournament against Pakistan having started their title defence with a 124-run thrashing of their traditional foes in Birmingham under a fortnight ago.
While it may be one of crickets oldest cliches to label Pakistan unpredictable, theyve done their best to live up to it during this tournament.
After a performance against India even Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur labelled shambolic, they bounced back to beat top-ranked South Africa.
Pakistan then held their nerve to beat Sri Lanka in what was a virtual quarter-final in Cardiff on Monday.
Two days on, they raised their game still further to inflict a crushing eight-wicket defeat of previously unbeaten tournament hosts England in a semi-final in the Welsh capital.
For all that Indias margin of victory was greater, Pakistans last-four success was arguably even more impressive given they bowled England out for just 211.
The turnaround has been magnificent, said Kohli of Pakistans progress.
Theyve beaten sides that looked really strong against them.
For Bangladesh their first major semi-final was a reality check.
Having been spared all but certain elimination when rain washed out their match with Australia, the Tigers got to the knockout phase with just one win, albeit their defeat of New Zealand was a well-deserved success.
Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan was left lamenting the fact his side had been nowhere near their best against India.
I thought we were in a very good situation to score 300-320, that would have been a different game, said Shakib. Losing those two wickets to an occasional bowler obviously didnt help.
With our runs and that wicket, we knew it was very hard for our bowlers, but still I think we were nowhere near our best today, especially in our bowling and fielding.  AFP

Iraqis in US sue to prevent their deportations
US: Iraqi immigrants sued the US government Thursday to avoid deportation following raids last weekend in the Detroit area, saying they feared religious persecution if sent home.
The raids targeted more than 100 people -- mostly Chaldean Christians, but also Shiite Muslims and Christian converts, advocates said.
Most have lived in the US for decades and fear being targeted by extremists should they be sent back to Iraq.
US Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the immigrants targeted in the weekend raids all had criminal records.
Seven of the detainees participated in the class action lawsuit asking a federal court in Michigan to halt the deportation process for all of those arrested.
Not only is it immoral to send people to a country where they are likely to be violently persecuted, it expressly violates United States and international law and treaties, said Kary Moss, head of the Michigan chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the suit on the detainees' behalf. The weekend raids sent chills through the sizeable community of Chaldean Christians in the Detroit area, who comprised the majority of those arrested.
We have seen a number of families who are completely shaken up, in particular kids who are missing a parent, Nathan Kalasho, a Chaldean Christian who operates a charter school in the Detroit area, told AFP prior to the lawsuit being filed. - AFP

ISIS chief recruiter targets youths from Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka
A fugitive chief recruiter of the Islamic State in the Indian subcontinent has targeted youths from three countriesIndia, Bangladesh and Sri Lankato involve them with the global terror outfit.
Mohammed Shafi Armar, a tech-savvy, has been operating on Facebook and other personal messenger services to contact, brainwash and recruit youths from the three nations, reports NDTV today.
He has been named a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the US yesterday, becoming the first Indian leader of the terror outfit against whom America has sponsored sanctions.
The US State Treasury Department, while updating its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT), has included in it Armar, a native of Bhatkal in Karnataka, clearing the way for sanctions against him, adds the report.
An Interpol Red Corner notice is also pending against the 30-year-old Armar, who has many aliases like Chhote Maula, Anjan Bhai and Yousuf al-Hindi.
Mohammed Shafi Armar is a leader and head recruiter in India for the Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group, ISIS, the State Department said.
He has cultivated a group of dozens of ISIS sympathisers who are involved in terrorist activities across India, such as plotting attacks, procuring weapons, and identifying locations for terrorist training camps, said the statement.
Armar first came on the radar of investigation agencies when the NIA was probing suspected ISIS cadres in Ratlam of Madhya Pradesh.

Joes go out favourites but Rajans can pull off a surprise
St. Josephs College Maradana will once again go out as favourites as they have a slight edge over their opponents when they take on one of the most unpredictable teams this season in Dharmaraja College Kandy, who can pull off a surprise win in their Milo 'A' division inter-school knockout rugby tournament first semi-final match at the Sugathadasa Stadium today at 4.15pm.
Dharmaraja kicked off this season losing to formidable league runners up Isipathana College, league champs Royal College, St. Josephs College and St. Anthony's College Kandy but went on to beat St. Peters College and D.S. Senanayake College in the just concluded Singer league rugby tournament.
They were really fortunate to receive a walkover in the quarterfinals of the knockout when league champs Royal College pulled out of the Milo knockout due to injuries to several of their top players. Rajans thus went straight into the semi-finals.
The Josephians started the season with two losses after close battles against Royal and Isipathana before beating Dharmaraja College Kandy, St. Anthonys College Kandy, arch rivals St. Peters College, D.S. Senanayake College and S. Thomas College ML before losing to Wesley College and Trinity College in the league.
In the ongoing Milo knockout championship quarterfinal match Joes ran out winners by beating Wesley 43-29 in a tense game.
Meanwhile Dharmaraja will have to watch out for the opposition speedy three quarters and have to match their opponents really well to prevent St. Josephs from scoring through their famous three quarter moves. The two forward packs are evenly matched; hence a close tussle for supremacy can be expected in today's game.
St. Josephs will be led by experienced Sri Lanka junior national winger Vinul Fernando with fly half Chathura Seneviratne as their play maker. They are coached by ex- Kingswoodian Nilfer Ibrahim.
Playmaker Chamika Perera will captain Dharmaraja with former Isipathanian Kapila Silva as their head coach.
Whoever wins this encounter will have a berth in next weeks all important final on Saturday June 24 under floodlights at Race Course International Stadium.

Johnny be good as Lions sweat on Farrell
Wellington, Friday: The spotlight will be firmly on Johnny Sexton when the British and Irish Lions play the Maori All Blacks on Saturday, with the Lions unsure if top fly-half Owen Farrell will be fit for the first Test.
Farrell, the Lions' leading playmaker, was almost certain to start in the first Test against the All Blacks next weekend, until he suffered a thigh strain at training on Thursday.
"He will be back on the field as soon as possible," was all assistant coach Steve Borthwick could offer as a heavily bandaged Farrell watched the Lions train on Friday.
It is an injury that usually sidelines a player for seven to 10 days. But Borthwick would not put a time frame on Farrell's return, saying: "He will be back as soon as he is able to be back."
Gatland had almost settled on his match-day 23 to face the All Blacks next weekend until Farrell's plight threw open the pivotal 10 slot.
Ireland's Sexton, 31, the Lions' star when they toured Australia four years ago, had already been named to start against the Maori.
Farrell was on the bench, possibly to partner Sexton in the second-half playmaker combination which the Lions used against the Canterbury Crusaders.
But if Farrell does not recover in a week then an out-of-form Sexton is likely to wear the 10 jersey in the first Test.
"Johnny needs more rugby," Gatland admitted when he named his side to face the Maori.
"He knows he hasn't been playing the best but he's got some mojo back and we wanted to give him the start."
Although Gatland has said he did not want to show his Test hand too early, he has telegraphed the core of his top line up by naming 11 players from the team that beat the Canterbury Crusaders last weekend in the side to play the Maori. That includes keeping the loose-forward trio of Taulupe Faletau, Sean O'Brien and Peter O'Mahony at the expense of tour captain Sam Warburton, who is on the bench.
"He's well aware of the competition that's there at the moment," Gatland said.
"He fully understands that loose-forward trio went outstandingly well against the Crusaders.
"The challenge for them is do it again, and if they do it again then we will sit down and make what we think is the right selection for the Test matches."
Like the Crusaders game, the clash with the Maori is being seen as an unofficial Test and the Lions can expect to have their defensive systems tested by a side with a reputation for free-flowing rugby. The backs contain three of the most elusive runners in New Zealand -- Nehe Milner-Skudder, Rieko Ioane and Damian McKenzie -- with All Blacks scrum-half Tawera Kerr-Barlow to set them alight.
The Maori All Blacks beat the Lions 19-13 when they last toured 12 years ago, and coach Colin Cooper has drummed into his squad that they can do it again. "It will be about attacking holes and manipulating their defence," said McKenzie. AFP

Labour on the rise in Britain
British voters on June 8 dashed hopes of Prime Minister Theresa May to form a strong and stable Conservative Government to strengthen her hand at Brexit negotiations. Instead it elected a hung Parliament where the Conservative Party obtained 318 seats, 13 less than it had earlier. It received 42.45 percent of the vote against 39.99 for the Labour Party which increased its representation to 262, with an addition of 32new seats. The Scottish National Party obtained 35 seats, a reduction of 19 seats in the new Parliament.
Since 326 seats are required for a majority in the House no party could form a stable government. Despite the inability to obtain an absolute majority Prime Minister May has now formed a coalition government with the small Democratic Union Party of Northern Ireland which won 10 seats in Parliament.
What does the election results signify First of all it signifies the weakening of the Conservative Party vote base and the rise of the Labour Party under its new Leader, trade unionist and human rights activist Jeremy Corbyn. Corbyn has been in Parliament since 1983. It is much more than a general sift to Labour for Corbyn has steered the party away from its former neo-liberal agenda.
Labour Party, though unable to obtain a working majority in Parliament seems to be the principal victor at the election. It received its highest vote share since 2006. The strengthening of the Labour Party is attributed to the large youth vote. In that sense it has a good prospect at the next General election, which may not be distant in view of the unstable nature of the new government of Theresa May.
Labour under Corbyn campaigned against the austerity programme of the government, privatization, and neo-liberal policies. It called for universal healthcare coverage, increased access to higher education, nationalization of critical entities, free college tuition, free lunch to all primary and pre-schoolchildren, economic security for workers, massive expansion of public housing, higher taxation of corporations and the richest 5 percent et al.
Among its proposals were also an increase of the minimum wage of workers to US $ 15 per hour, empowerment of trade unions, free pre-school education and the reduction of the voting age to 16.
It is apparent that the Labour Manifesto has much in common with the general principles of socialist development and its endorsement by an increasing segment of the British voters, especially the young ones testifies to the viability of the socialist dream which has not lost its glamour despite the demise of the Soviet Union and the subsequent developments. On the other hand, the world economic and financial crisis of 2008 in which Britain was severely affected and the failure of neo-liberalism to overcome the crisis so far has strengthened the search for an alternative to capitalist development.
Corbins agenda was highly critical of the participation of the United Kingdom in the aggressive unilateral wars unleashed by Washington since the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. Corbyn had openly criticized British collaboration in those wars in Afghanistan, Libya and Syria from the inception. He has promised to ensure a more secure Britain through a radical change in the foreign policy instead of unleashing a war on terror in the Bush or Trump style.
France elects new Parliament
French President Macrons Forward Movement party seems to obtain a sweeping majority at the French elections. In the first round that was concluded his party won 32 percent of the vote as against 21.2 percent for the Republican Party. Socialists received only 10 percent while the Far Right National Front of Le Pen received 13.9 percent, a reduction by 4 million the number of votes it received at the Presidential election a month ago. One thing, however, is clear. That is the traditional parties are on their way to death. Even the Far Left received more votes (14 percent) than the Socialists (13 percent).
It is estimated that after the second round of the elections scheduled for June 18 President Macrons Forward Movement Party would get 400-440 seats in the 577 seat Parliament and the Republicans would get about 100 with the rest going to minor parties.
In any case, voters have not shown much enthusiasm in the Parliamentary election. Less than 50 percent have gone to the polls to vote. This is in contrast to the last three Parliamentary elections where the voter turnout was 61 percent.

Mahendrans lawyer pinpoints errors in AGs analysis
AG says those are not serious ones:
You cannot say it is not a serious error, Justice Chitrasiri:
There are certain data and mathematical errors in an analysis prepared by the Auditor General which he presented to the Presidential Commission that inquires into the Treasury bond issue, it was revealed yesterday.
The AGs analysis is on the Treasury bond issuance from February 2015 to the end of March 2016.
It comes in as a power point presentation, and is partly based on data derived from the audit report he provided to the COPE committee that inquired into the Treasury bond issue and some new materials as well.
Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva pointed out there are some errors in the data presented in this analysis regarding a questioned bond auction taken place on March 26, 2016.
De Silva was leading evidence through Auditor General H.M.Gamini Wijesinghe yesterday.
According to the analysis of AG Wijesinghe, the difference between the bids offered at the 26 March 2016 auction and the bids accepted at it, runs up to a 329%. De Silva suggested that the calculation is wrong, because the data included in the relevant graph is incorrect.
Former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendrans Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva pointed out to the Commission that, on March 26, 2016 Rs.40 billion worth bids have been offered. He was referring to a press release issued by the Central Bank after the said auction.
De Silva producing the relevant press release to the Presidential Commission pointed out that the amount of bids offered that day under four separate ICINs was Rs.40 billion, 10 billion each. Thus, the offered amount of bids taken as a percentage of the accepted amount, is only a 190%, de Silva further pointed out.
De Silva asked whether an error of this nature is not serious, to which AG Wijesinghe said, that he does not consider such an error to be such a serious one.
We refer to many data and documents when preparing analysis as this and there could be occurrences as these, AG Wijesinghe said.
Presidential Commission Chairman Supreme Court Judge, Justice K.T.Chitrasiri told AG Wijesinghe that he cannot say that it is not a serious error.
If this revelation was not done today, we would have considered your analysis to be an accurate one. So it is important that you think carefully before you answer these questions, Justice Chitrasiri said.
It was also revealed at the Commission that from 2008 to January 2015, direct placements have been offered to the captive sources, below the prevailing market rate, causing losses to bodies such as the Employees Provident Fund.
De Silva pointed out to the Commission that within the year 2008 alone, the EPF has under gone a loss of Rs.3.872 billion by purchasing Treasury bonds below the market rate. The Commission requested De Silva to produce calculations regarding the same issue in other years as well.
De Silva said as investing in Treasury bonds and bills carry 0% risk, the EPF could have easily purchased bonds at a higher market rate.
It was also revealed that only 0.58% of all the Rs.4.7 trillion issued via direct placements from 2008-2015, have been issued correctly.
AG Wijesinghe is to testify before the Commission next Monday (19) as well.

Minister berates corrupt officials for creating garbage disposal issue
Provincial Council and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha said Commissioners and Secretaries of local government bodies should resign from their posts if they cannot manage the garbage disposal issue.
These officers know exactly how corruption flourishes on garbage collection and disposal for a long time.This has become one of the main sources of income for corrupt officials.They do not want to solve the problem as they lose income.Corrupt officials should be responsible for the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse. If they acted responsibly and genuinely by taking correct decisions timely, such a disaster would have not have happened, he said.
Garbage collection and disposal has become one of the most corrupt businesses in Sri Lanka. We must be ashamed as we were unable to find a permanent solution to the garbage problem since Independence.Though we commenced the garbage segregation last June, this exercise did not meet with much success. Eventhough, people have been asked to segregate their organic and inorganic waste, they do not seem to practice this concept, Therefore, it is necessary to make an attitudinal change among the people. If the householders care to separate out the kitchen waste from other waste, and manage the kitchen waste within their own premises using compost bins and hand over only the non-perishable waste to collectors which could be recycled, this problem would not have built upto the mountainous level.
The Minster said he will solve this problem without leaving it to anyone else. Even though a large amount of money is spent for the garbage collection and disposal, the problem is not solved still. He said the officials appointed to the Task Force should be duty bound to solve this problem. Every citizen living in the city is also responsible for this misadventure. It is the garbage generated by each and every household from the affluent to the poor that gets dumped here. If no garbage is generated, there will be no garbage dumps and no such tragedies. Therefore, we will take action to impose massive fines on those who throw garbage on streets through the Task Force in the future.
The Minister also requested the supermarket owners to stop the usage of polythene bags which has badly affected the waste problem.Nearly 6 billon polythene bags are used daily in super markets in the country currently. Therefore, stopping the use of polythene is a great benefit for the country.

Nadals approach to life: I do things as they come
Rafael Nadal made an observation in Paris about his philosophy on life that sounded innocuous enough to dip below the radar of those who were correctly more concerned with the history he had just created but it describes perfectly why he is playing some of the best tennis of his career.
His words reveal, too, that the 31-year-old Spaniard, who has suffered more injuries than is good for his long-term health, is not done just yet.
Very organised people, very proactive people, know exactly what theyre going to do next, Nadal said after looking about as organised as is possible on a tennis court in demolishing Stan Wawrinka in three sets to win his 10th French Open. I do things as they come. Right now, I dont really know. Im just going to keep on playing as long as it makes me happy. If one day I get up in the morning and Im no longer motivated to go train, well, I guess that day I will put an end to my career. You know what Im not worried. Im a happy person.
Like his oldest rival, Roger Federer, he is playing with the sort of freedom known only to the very young and those who have seen it all. It is a joy that might carry Nadal to his first Wimbledon final in seven years. He might even win for the third time there. Or, as he admits, he could just as easily fall early if his unreliable knees do not adapt quickly to the peculiar demands of grass, as they did when he lost to the world No100, Lukas Rosol, in the second round in 2012.
Nadal, more than most players, has endured extended periods of struggle, when his love for the game has been tested. He almost expects them to return. In 2005 his emotions were dragged in all directions. He met his long-time girlfriend, Maria Francisca Perello, and won the first of the 10 French championships that set him on his journey to La Decima on Sunday, as well as an unprecedented decade of winning at least one slam every year. However, 2005 was also the year that structural weaknesses surfaced in his feet and knees and they have plagued him, to a great or lesser degree, ever since. He has been struck down in 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2014.
In 2013 he came back from nearly eight months out to heal ruptured patellar tendons and won two majors among 10 titles and posted 75 match victories. It was an astonishing achievement. Bjorn Borg, no slouch on the dirt, was moved to call him the greatest clay-court player to ever play. Carlos Moy, who has since joined him as eventual coaching successor to uncle Toni, described him as a warrior. Jimmy Connors remarked at the time: His passion and the way he grinds is really something special.
Because he can play no other way it is easy to take this commitment for granted, without wondering about the price he pays. Last year he had to quit the French Open after two quick wins because of a wrist injury. Only this season has he begun to resemble the old Nadal. If he looks commanding and fierce on court  so deep in the zone Nadal rarely reacts to extraneous activity  he sometimes appears uncertain of himself. Eight times in one answer on Sunday evening, he used the word doubts. For a long time he had pronounced it doobts. He knows how to say it now and he has a proper grasp of its essence. I have been very honest with you all the time, he said. I have doubts every day. If you have no doubts, probably [it] is because you are too arrogant. I dont consider myself arrogant.
What might surprise Nadal, however, is that there is a groundswell of worthwhile opinion saying he can win Wimbledon again. It would be on a par with Federers win in Melbourne this year, when he beat Nadal in the final. Even so, nobody  not even uncle Toni or his understudy Moy  would previously have suggested Nadal could conquer the All England Clubs grass again.
He told the English-speaking press on Sunday: I love grass, everybody knows, and its a surface that I really enjoyed a lot playing there. However, he said to Spanish reporters later: Grass is not my speciality, but Im very motivated.
He nonetheless reminded everyone when beating Wawrinka 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 that clay fits the script for a natural clay-courter who has rediscovered his killing top-spun forehand and now owns a backhand that is nearly as lethal. If he stays fit and healthy, he could win another two or three titles in Paris, putting him beyond reach in the record books. That might also haul him alongside Federer on 18 majors  although there is no sign the Swiss has finished collecting big silverware. If Nadal rules clay again, Federer likewise is ready to retake his Wimbledon crown. What a story it would be if the draw kept them apart until the last Sunday. It is nine years since Nadal won possibly the best final in the history of grand slam tennis, when, over five sets of almost unbearable intensity, he deconstructed Federers elegance with the sheer power of his will, it seemed. Before they arrived at that 2008 Wimbledon they played in the final at Roland Garros. Nadal won 61, 63, 60. It was one of the most humiliating experiences of Federers career. Now Wawrinka has felt the French heat of Nadal before Wimbledon. It would be foolish to predict the Spanish master could not do that double again.  the Guardian

New Megapolis Project underway
Call for proposals to be announced this weekend:
The Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) under the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development (GOSL), will initiate the tender process this weekend for the first leg of a proposed ferry transport system in Colombo. The project will be implemented as a public/private partnership.
As detailed in the 2016 Megapolis transport master plan, several of Colombos inland waterways would be utilized for passenger ferries whereby commuters and recreational users may travel across various parts of Colombo, avoiding traffic and enjoying scenic views. The first phase
would be a service from Wellawatte to Battaramulla. A ferry service from Fort to Union Place in the Beira Lake, as well as from Mattakkuliya to Hanwella along the Kelani River are also in the pipeline, as are potential other routes such as the Hamilton Canal towards Negombo.
The tender process which is open to both international and local investors, is being supported by PPP advisors from the Government of the Netherlands, under a Government-to-Government technical assistance initiative. The Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation
(SLLRDC) under the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development (GOSL) will be the lead agency for the project. Tender notices and detailed documentation for bidders will be posted on www.megapolis.gov.lk and www.landreclamation.lk on Sunday and an investor dialog is expected to be held in July.
The service along the Wellawatte-Battaramulla canal is expected to be operational in early 2018, and the Beira Lake ferry to be operational within the year as well.

No future constructions without proper garbage recycling plans: Patali
Any future constructions without proper plans to recycle garbage would not be allowed in Colombo and the suburbs, as part of the governments bid to solve the citys garbage menace,Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
He said the people would not be allowed to just drain water into the drainage lines and dispose of the garbage on roads and hand over the matter to the Municipal Councils and Urban Councils.
He also said that residents of housing complexes and others who generate garbage should pay for the disposal and recycling process in future since seeking funds for the same is one of the main cause of the issue.
Minister Ranawaka was speaking at a press conference at Ministry Auditorium in Suhurupaya, Battaramulla as part of the Nikasala Purawara (Garbage Free City) project inauguration ceremony.
He further said that two other main reasons for the issue are legal background and social protests. He added that garbage disposal comes under Local Government institutions. But, the Municipal Councils and Pradeshiya Sabahs come under Provincial Councils purview.
This is one issue, the Minister said. He added that this could be solved by setting up a separate institution to manage the garbage issue.
The people protest when a garbage disposal unit is to be set up somewhere in the country saying they do not need garbage from Colombo, the Minister said.
Thereafter, they would make statements to the media for the failure to collect garbage and then again protest against the government when an accident takes place, the Minister said.
He added that this cannot continue and nobody has the right to say that they do not want the garbage from Colombo, since it is not generated by only the residents of Colombo.
Minister Ranawaka added that the large number of people who come to Colombo which is the countrys commercial hub daily are responsible for the garbage accumulation in the city.

Pakistan ready to change history against India
LONDON June16: Pakistan are ready to change the course of history in a clash that's bigger than the Ashes when they face arch-rivals India in the Champions Trophy final.Some estimates suggest Sunday's match between the sub-continental cricket giants at the Oval in south London could attract a worldwide television audience of more than a billion viewers. Title-holders India will be firm favourites against a Pakistan side who were the lowest ranked of all the teams taking part in a tournament featuring the world's top-eight one-day international sides.
It was only on June 4 that India launched their title defence with a 124-run rout of Pakistan at Edgbaston.
Yet even by their own unpredictable standards, Pakistan's transformation since that reverse has been remarkable and on Wednesday they knocked previously unbeaten tournament hosts England out of the competition with a comprehensive eight-wicket win in Cardiff.
Pakistan have yet to play a match at the Oval this tournament but in bowling coach Azhar Mahmood, who spent several seasons at his second home playing for Surrey, they have someone familiar with all the vagaries of the London ground. And the former Pakistan all-rounder insisted all the burden of expectation was now on India's shoulders.
We've got nothing to lose -- the pressure is more on them, Azhar told reporters at the Oval on Friday.
They are ranked higher than us - so everyone is talking about India. But I can tell you one thing -- we have come to win. India have won all three of their previous matches with Pakistan in the knockout stages of International Cricket Council tournaments to date but Azhar, 42, said there was no reason why the sequence had to be extended this weekend as well. -AFP

Photographic competition on Reconciliation by ONUR
The Office of the National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) with the assistance of the European Union delegation to Sri Lanka and Maldives will jointly hold a photographic competition under the theme national reconciliation. Both Amateur and professional photographers are invited to submit any number of their interpretations of the theme of reconciliation to the exhibition. The initiative of the competition is a means for Sri Lankans to capture and share their ideas on what reconciliation means to them, in the context of reaching 70 years since independence and the way forward towards a just and equitable society, ONUR Director General M.S. Jayasinghe said.
Out of the submitted, 70 best entries will be evaluated and selected by an expert panel of judges. The evaluated photos will be featured in a public exhibition which is going to be held in September this year under the title Hope.
Besides, selected photos will also be published in the EU Delegation calendar for 2018 and a booklet produced by ONUR. The organizers encourage submissions from amateur photographers including photos taken with smartphones, ONUR Assistant Director Mohomad Hisham said.
It has been planned to give valuable prizes to the winners of both the amateur and professional categories, he added. Supporting reconciliation in Sri Lanka is a key priority for the European Union, Councillor at the EU delegation Paul Godfrey said.
The EU has partnered with the ONUR aiming to encourage Sri Lankans to reflect on their hopes for the future of the country. "We want this exhibition to generate discussion about empathizing with fellow Sri Lankans on the need for national reconciliation. The exhibition will pave the way for such a discussion on reconciliation after reaching seven decades since independence. Through reconciliation we believe there is hope for more inclusive identities that value the diversity of people and culture in the island," Godfrey added.
The ONUR is working on various fronts aiming to take the message of the national unity and reconciliation forward, Jayasinghe said.
Contestants of the photo contest are requested to email their entries to [emailprotected] along with the name of the photograph, location of it and preffered title. An entry should not exceed 25MB.

President berates attempts to create civil unrest
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said various attempts are being made through the internet and some media institutions, to spread civil unrest among communities in the country.
He further said that if any individual or organisation acts obstructing the day-to-day life of the people,it is a matter of their education and civilisation.
He made these remarks participating in the annual prize giving ceremony of the Sri Chandananda Buddhist College, Asgiriya, yesterday.
The President said that when he asked the Colombo Archbishop, Most Rev.Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, regarding a statement made by a person during an interview with a private news channel that 166 Catholic churches were attacked during the past few months, the Archbishop of Colombo said no such incidents have been not reported. The President further said that he vehemently rejects such kind of statements made by some persons misleading society with ulterior objectives in mind.
President Maithripala Sirisena also said the Government has not taken any decision to make any changes to the school uniform.The education system centered on the Pirivena and temples nourished the then Sri Lankan society with human values and passionate, the President said that adding all the religious leaders should commit themselves to build a society which closely associate with religious places.

Provincial minister laments lack of recognition for disaster relief effort
Contributions by media personnel and state officials by going out of their way to help the flood and landslide affected by forsaking their lives and undergoing privations, have not gained proper recognition and appreciation, Southern Province Education Minister Chandima Rasaputra said.
He made this observation during a press conference at his Ministry at Dakshina Paya, Labuduwa, Galle to mark the award of financial aid to 16 media personnel affected by the recent natural disaster, yesterday.
Minister Rasaputra said media personnel went out of their way staking their safety to provide correct information about the damage to the public during the disaster. Some of them climbed dangerous terrain to capture the devastation caused on lenses.
If their lives were lost, their families would have fallen destitute.
Media personnel who rendered a selfless service during the recent catastrophe should come in for special praise, the provincial minister said.

Root rues golden chance that got away
CARDIFF, Thursday  Joe Root accepted England had missed a golden chance to end their long wait for a maiden one-day international title after a crushing eight-wicket Champions Trophy semi-final defeat by Pakistan.
But the star batsman, Englands Test skipper, is determined to put the hurt the white-ball side feel now to good use when the country stages the 2019 World Cup.
England, despite competing in 19 major ICC ODI events since the inaugural World Cup back in 1975 have yet to lift a trophy.
Their only comparable limited overs success came when they won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 in the Caribbean.
England have undergone something of an ODI revival since a dismal first-round exit at the 2015 World Cup.
But none of that dash or even much in the way of cricket know-how was on show as they failed to adjust to the demands of playing on a used pitch against Pakistan in Cardiff on Wednesday.
Having been 128 for two, they lost their last eight wickets for 83 runs as they slumped to a lowly 211 all out.
Well though Pakistan bowled, the knowledge they had struggled to get to 237 in seeing off Sri Lanka in the Welsh capital just two days earlier was a stark reminder to England of what might have been had they managed to set a total of around 250-270.
Instead, Pakistan were able to cruise to their victory target, having adapted to the slow and low surface with some skilled seam bowling and dynamic batting.
Im just very disappointed, said Root, who top-scored for England with 46.
Weve played some really good cricket throughout the whole of this summer, and it was frustrating not being able to do it (in the semi-final).
This doesnt feel great at the minute but theres a lot of cricket still to play this summer, and weve got to make sure were right for that.  AFP

Sanka Guruge, the humanitarian who saved 47 lives
Among those who shine due to their efforts during flood relief work, Sanka Guruge is a highlight.
Guruge, a resident of Akuretiya, Baddegama, rescued 14 affected families comprising 47 people during the disaster caused by inclement weather.
Sanka Guruge
Guruges family provided all facilities for the 47 flood victims for over three days, providing shelter at his residence and another house until the water receded.
A majority of the villagers depended on small - scale tea cultivation for their livelihoods. During the heavy floods, the area was inaccessible. Flood water was found over rooftops at Akuretiya and the water level reached over 20 feet. Some victims were found hanging on rafters.
Many of Guruges tea plantations located in low-lying areas and on river beds were completely destroyed. Sanka was running a large scale ornamental fish farm in a low-lying area in the river valley of Gin Ganga.
He had imported a ship load of fingerling from Thailand and bred them to be exported once the fish reached commercial value.
He said during the floods, his tanks were destroyed and lost a shipload of imported ornamental fish. The total cost of the damage was over Rs. 2.3 million.
When asked how he managed to provide food for such a large crowd, he said rice is usually stocked to meet emergencies at his house as it is located in the flood-prone area.
He added that in his lifetime, he had never seen floods of this nature.

Security under spotlight at Russia's Confed Cup
Sochi, Thursday: The Confederations Cup kicks off on Saturday when Russia play New Zealand in St Petersburg, with the hosts promising there will be no repeat of the violence which marred Euro 2016.
A year before Russia holds the World Cup, the behaviour of fans and concerns over racism are topics the host nation hopes will not be a factor at the eight-team Confederations Cup.
The June 17-July 2 tournament is effectively a scaled-down warm-up for the 2018 World Cup finals.
"Russia is a completely safe country and I am sure that our football fans will behave," Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko told TASS news agency.
"All of us, as well as those visiting, must respect the culture and traditions of Russia. Our country is safe and open," added Mutko, who is also the president of the Russian Football Union.
By far the biggest name at the tournament will be global superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who will captain Euro 2016 winners Portugal.
World champions Germany, Ronaldo's Portugal and south American champions Chile are amongst the favourites to win the final in St Petersburg on July 2.
Hosts Russia are in Group A with Portugal, Mexico, the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup winners, and New Zealand, the 2016 Oceania champions.
Germany face Copa America title-holders Chile, 2015 Asian Cup champions Australia, and this year's Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon in Group B.
Germany head coach Joachim Loew has questioned the value of hosting a Confederations Cup between Euro 2016 and next year's World Cup.
"I probably wouldn't be sad if it didn't take place in 2021," Loew said when naming an inexperienced squad, making no apology for resting his stars.
The 57-year-old has made it clear next year's World Cup is the priority.
Only three of the squad, which has a combined total of 104 international appearances, formed part of the 2014 World Cup-winning group and Loew has named seven uncapped players.AFP

Seven US Navy crew missing after collision off Japan

Seven US Navy crew members are missing after their ship collided with a merchant vessel off the coast of Japan.
Among the injured is the ship's commanding officer who has been taken to hospital by helicopter.
The Navy destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship ACX Crystal about 56 nautical miles (103km) south-west of Yokosuka at about 2:30am local time (18:30 BST) on Saturday.
Aerial images showed heavy damage on the destroyer's starboard side.
The ship's commanding officer, Cmdr Bryce Benson, was in a stable condition after being transferred to US Naval Hospital Yokosuka, according to Navy officials.
Two other sailors were flown to hospital by helicopter for treatments for "lacerations and bruises", said the US 7th Fleetvia Twitter.
It said earlier that the USS Fitzgerald had experienced flooding in some areas, and the full extent of injuries was being determined.
It also said the 154m ship was now on its way to Yokosuka - under its own power, but with limited propulsion.
The area where the collision took place is extremely busy, with shipping heading in and out of Tokyo bay.
However, the USS Fitzgerald is one of the most advanced warships in the world - with highly sophisticated radars systems.
There will now be lots of questions about why its crew failed to avoid collision with a 200m (700ft) long container ship.
The coast guard said the ACX Crystal container ship carried a Filipino flag and weighed just under 30,000 tonnes, about three times that of the USS Fitzgerald.
It sustained lighter damage to the port bow, according to Japanese national broadcaster NHK.
In a statementreleased on social media, US Navy operations chief Adm John Richardson said: "As more information is learnt we will be sure to share it with the Fitzgerald families and when appropriate the public. [...]
All our thoughts and concerns are with the Fitzgerald crew and their families."

Sri Lanka ranks 90th on Global Innovation Index: Report
Sri Lanka has moved up one place to 90th among 130 nations on the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2017, slowly emerging as one of the top-ranked economies in Central and South Asia in the lower-middle income group.
The island nation has a score of 29.9 out of 100, according to the latest report while the country was ranked 91st in the 2016 report.
Sri Lanka has a very low score of 18.6 for Human Capital and Research while as well as a score of 47.3 for Infrastructure and 42.2 for Market sophistication.Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands, the US and UK retained their top spots as the most-innovative countries.
The index, co-authoured by Cornell University, INSEAD and World Intellectual Property Organisation shows Sri Lankas rise as an emerging innovation centre in Asia, although the country ranks far behind India which occupied the 60th spot. Among Sri Lankas other neighbours, Nepal took the 109th spot while Pakistan came in at 113 followed by Bangladesh at 114.
In 2017, Switzerland leads the rankings for the seventh consecutive year, with high-income economies taking 24 of the top 25 spots, except China which in 2016, became the first- ever middle-income economy in the top 25.
Public policy plays a pivotal role in creating an enabling environment conducive to innovation. Since the last two years, we have seen important activities around the GII in India like the formation of Indias high-level task force on innovation and consultative exercises on both innovation policy and better innovation metrics, CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.
Each year, the GII surveys some 130 economies using dozens of metrics, from patent filings to education spending, providing decision makers a high-level look at the innovative activity that increasingly drives economic and social growth. - Agencies

Strict action against those overstaying illegally in Israel : Thalatha
Strict legal action will be taken against those who are living illegally in Israel after completing their employment contracts, said Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala.
She made this observation at a function held recently at the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Agency to hand over air tickets to 22 Sri Lankans who have been granted with jobs in the agriculture sector in Israel.
Addressing the occasion, Minister Athukorale stressed the necessity of returning to Sri Lanka once the contract period is complete, adding that around 59 Sri Lankans currently reside there illegally.
There is a considerable growth in the number of job opportunities received from Israel to Sri Lanka compared to 2015, due to the successful discussions held by Athukorala with relevant authorities in Israel during her visit to Israel in 2016.
Around 201 Sri Lankans have been granted job opportunities in Israel from January up to now, and around 369 Sri Lankans have been granted jobs in the agriculture sector in Israel in 2016. Only 85 Sri Lankans have been selected to work in Israel in 2015.
Job opportunities in Israel are granted through the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Agency and a Memorandum of Understanding has also been signed between the two countries to recruit caregivers from Sri Lanka and the first batch comprising eight caregivers have already left to Israel.

Thousands mourn as body of Tiote brought home
Abidjan,Thursday: Around a thousand fans and some twenty international teammates were present at Abidjan airport on Thursday to pay their respects as the body of football star Cheick Tiote, who died in China earlier this month aged 30, was brought home.
A key member of the Ivory Coast team which ended a 23-year drought in winning the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, his manager from that time Herve Renard had made the trip as had teammates Salomon Kalou, Kader Keita and Wilfried Bony.
"I have come here for my brother, my colleague, my friend. Words cannot explain the depths of my sadness," said Manchester City striker Bony.
"He was like a little brother, like family and we're here today to show that - we shared everything," said the 35-year-old Keita.
Keita was wearing a white t-shirt with the words 'Rest in peace Cheicky' upon it.
Tiote, a 52-time capped player, who was at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, will be honoured with a military funeral on Sunday.
The forward moved to China in February from England's Newcastle United. He collapsed at training with second-tier Chinese club Beijing Enterprises on June 5.
Tiote was very well liked in English football circles after his stint with Newcastle, including six Premier League campaigns before their relegation last year.
He began his European club career with Belgian outfit Anderlecht and had a loan spell at Roda JC Kerkrade before moving to FC Twente in 2008.
Tiote signed for Newcastle in 2010 and made 156 appearances for the club, becoming a firm favourite with fans. AFP

A timely and necessary fight against hate mongers
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes statement on law enforcement authorities being directed to initiate immediate action against those engaging in hate speech, and perpetrators and initiators of violence against religious and ethnic groups is both timely and welcome, considering the delays by the relevant authorities, particularly the Police, to take the necessary action in such situations which have shown a marked increase in recent months.
He made it clear that if someone engages in communal, ethnic and religious hatred and violence, and related hate speech, prompt action would be taken to inquire into such situations, arrest and produce such offenders before the courts.
It was important that the PM said this action as a reaffirmation of the policy of the National Unity Government, headed by President Maithripala Sirisena, in accordance with the mandate received from the people at the Presidential election on January 8, 2015 to ensure the country never returns to a conflict-ridden past, and instead resolves to guide the nation towards reconciliation. He noted that this mandate was given in the context of the post-conflict situation after the end of the prolonged war with the LTTE, and the restoration of peace with necessary reconciliation.
He also reminded that the country was affected by the religious conflicts in 2014, particularly in Alutgama and Beruwala, with unity among communities damaged. The repeat of such incidents and situations would adversely affect the progress towards lasting peace, with the understanding among communities being damaged, and also affect the image of the country. He was very clear that such a situation could not be repeated in the larger national interest.
Particular relevance
The PMs statement is of particular relevance because of the image that has been created in recent weeks of political rivalry within the government on the issue of ethnic and religious discord and violence, and the use of the emergence of such violence for both propaganda and action against the government by forces of the opposition, particularly the Joint Opposition led by Mahinda Rajapaksa.
It is necessary to recall here the statements made by different ministers of government about knowing who is hiding or shielding the leader of the Budu Bala Sena, Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera, who has made many statements very insulting to the Muslim community, as well as provocative against the community, and who is making a show of keeping away from the law by his absence in court where his behaviour in Court of Law is being considered for alleged Contempt of Court. Such ministerial comments do little to show the commitment of government to the cause of national unity with inter-communal harmony. In fact they seemed to support some charges being made by the JO and key movers in the arousal of ethnic hatred attempting, to show emerging dangers of the Sinhala Buddhist majority, which remain largely unreal.
The reference by the PM to the Police being instructed to investigate into the attacking of several Muslim business and mosques was also of relevance because of the strong impression being created of the Police not ready to act with speed and commitment on these matters. This has been particularly striking on the non-arrest of the BBS leader, despite the use of four police teams for this purpose, as stated by the Police.
It will be interesting to see the new developments in this regard, following the PMs statement, with the Colombo Fort Magistrate issuing a warrant against BBS General Secretary Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera for the second time, earlier this week, following his failure to appear before the court on two consecutive occasions, with regard to his alleged behaviour in the Homagama Magistrates Court in January this year.
Northern corruption
There are interesting developments in the Northern Province on issues dealing with corruption among members of the Northern Provincial Council (NPC).
While the Northern Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran has called for the resignation of two Provincial Council members over allegations of corruption and fraud, there is also a demand from three parties of the Tamil National Alliance EPRLF, TELO and PLOTE - that all four ministers of the NPC should be removed. Of the two ministers whose resignation the Chief Minister called for  Education Minister T. Kurukularaja and Agriculture Minister P. Aingaranesan  Education Minister Kurukularaja has submitted his resignation to pave the way for a complete investigation.
It is believed the Motion of No Confidence against the Chef Minister, signed by 21 PC members, is following a call for the removal of all four ministers of the NPC, on alleged issues of corruption and fraud. The two ministers whose resignation were sought by the Chief Minister followed evidence against them being found by a committee appointed by the Chief Minister last year, comprising two retired judges and one retired GA, to investigate issues of fraud and corruption.
The situation with regard to the move of No Confidence in the Chief Minister will have to be seen in the context of wider political developments in the Northern Province.
This is a situation of special importance with regard to Provincial Administration in the country, with action being initiated on corruption against provincial ministers by the Chief Minister, which is a major move ahead in the fight against fraud and corruption in administration. There has been considerable criticism about the NPC and the Chief Minister with regard to the non-use of funds allocated from the Centre for development activities in the North. However, this move against corruption is certainly a good initiative, which should hopefully pave the way for the other provincial councils, too, in taking proper action to fight corruption in the provincial areas of administration. Such action at the provincial level, could certainly give a push to what is seen as the currently stalled action against corruption by the Central Government.
Mangala on MR and GSP Plus
Former Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera who is well aware of the negotiations on Sri Lanka regaining the GSP Plus facility of the European Union, has given an effective reply to Mahinda Rajapaksa seeking to belittle the advantages of GSP plus to the country; by stating the government should not create unrealistic expectation about it, as it is trivial, with Sri Lanka being very close to passing the threshold of an upper middle income country, which will take away this facility.
Mangala Samaraweera states that MR conveniently hides a fundamental issue, which is that a country has to be classified as upper middle income by the World Bank for three consecutive years in order to be no longer eligible for GSP Plus. Thus, even if Sri Lanka were to reach that threshold tomorrow, we would still have access to the advantages of GSP Plus for three years, and for one additional year after the decision is taken to withdraw the benefit.
He further states that this period of, at the very least four years, comes just when the European economy starts to show signals of growth recovery. With less unemployment and more consumer demand, this is the moment to join in enhanced partnership with the European Union!
There is also an effective response to MRs reasoning that Sri Lanka shouldn't aspire to a better deal, because some time in the future the economy will grow. As Mangala Samaraweera sees it, this is callous and insensitive to the workers of our country and their families. It reflects a complete lack of concern for our workers who expect progress in the immediate present, and they deserve progress in the immediate present. So what if Sri Lanka, thanks to the ingenuity and hard work of its entrepreneurs and workers looks poised to cross a certain threshold of average income Does it mean that we, as a government, should sit on our hands without giving them the opportunity for a better deal that they deserve now in the present Shouldn't we help them to reach our national goals sooner rather than later Over to Rajapaksa  one would say.
Minister Samaraweera is also critical of the Rajapaksa and JO criticism that GSP Plus puts Sri Lanka under the supervision of the EU, as simply absurd. He states that: By committing to a number of universal human rights principles, we do nothing that was not already recommended by Sri Lankan people who came before the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC).
Protecting every citizen from torture is not an alien imposition. It is a sovereign decision from a humanistic nation. How ironic that Mr. Rajapaksa who claims to be not just a follower but a guardian of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, does not advocate granting the very basic human rights principles and rights and freedoms to the citizens of this country! Dont our citizens deserve the highest standards of protection Dont our citizens deserve the highest standards of human rights and freedoms

Venezuelan mobs kick, burn thieves in lynching epidemic
VENEZUELA: Swearing in fury, the crowd strips the man naked and stomps on his head as he sprawls on the ground.
You want things that come easy Then take this, you bastard. In Venezuela, this is what robbers get when they are caught by passers-by.
It is not just the country's economy and political system that are sick, but society itself, experts say. An epidemic of lynchings is one of the most gruesome symptoms.
AFP journalists filmed a lynching close-up in a busy street in the capital Caracas.
A witness says he stopped the man who had tried to rob a woman at gunpoint in a bakery. Then the mob took over.
You're lucky we didn't burn you, a voice yells, as police lug the man, limp but still breathing, into the back of their car.
The crowd yells in satisfaction -- but not at the man's arrest. They think they are the ones who have done justice here.
Their aim is to kill the person before the police arrive, says Marco Ponce, coordinator of the Venezuelan Social Conflict Observatory (OVCS).
The body says some 60 people were recorded as killed in lynchings in the first five months of this year alone.
Last year there were 126 such killings -- a surge from the 20 reported in the previous year, coinciding with the worsening of political tensions and economic chaos.
In lynchings, citizens let out their anger in the face of a state that is not defending their right to justice, says Ponce. They think they are dispensing justice, and they do so with anger, so they go as far as killing the person.
Caracas resident Damaso Velasquez recalls taking part himself in a separate lynching.
I didn't feel pity for that person because I knew he was a criminal, he tells AFP.
I felt rage and hatred towards that person... I saw him committing a robbery. That makes you feel furious, so whatever happens to him, it's alright, he goes on.
The government grabs him, puts him in jail and then they let him go again. There is disorder here in Caracas -- starting with the government. Venezuela has one of the highest annual murder rates in the world -- 70 for every 100,000 inhabitants in 2016, according to the state prosecution service. Ponce sees the rise of lynchings as a sign of a social breakdown in Venezuela.
President Nicolas Maduro suggested that a man who was set on fire during a demonstration in May was targeted for being a government supporter. Witnesses said the crowd accused him of thieving.
Maduro broadcast a chilling video of the 22-year-old man running in flames after being doused in fuel and set alight. The man died in hospital two weeks later.
In another case, a man was set on fire by a crowd who thought he had committed a robbery, but it turned out he had been trying to help the victim.
A man was sentenced to six years in jail in March for taking part in that killing.
For some Venezuelans, the lynchings inspire as much terror as the criminals they are meant to punish.c - AFP
