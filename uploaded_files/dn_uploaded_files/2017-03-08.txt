Amaraweera calls for immediate investigation
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera who has drawn immediate attention to allegations made by Indian fishermen regarding the death of an Indian fisherman, has written to the Defence Ministry Secretary to launch an immediate investigation into the matter to elicit true information.
It is alleged that one person died and two others were injured when some persons opened fire at a group of Indian fishermen in the Sri Lankan waters on March 6 night.
A Fisheries Ministry release said although Indian fishermen were blaming the Sri Lanka Navy regarding this alleged incident, the Sri Lanka Navy had denied any responsibility for it.
However, Minister Amaraweera has pressed for an immediate investigation into the whole issue to obtain correct information. Minister Amaraweera had also spoken to the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka over the phone yesterday and discussed the matter in length. The Minister has told the High Commissioner that Sri Lanka would not leave any room to disrupt the longstanding friendship and good neighbourly relations between Sri Lanka and India due to incidents of this nature.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Affairs Ministry stated in a release that the Government of Sri Lanka is deeply concerned about the alleged shooting of Indian fishermen, and the connected loss of life of one fisherman and injury caused to another.
The safety of fishermen is of utmost importance and the Government of Sri Lanka is firm in its commitment to ensuring that all Government agencies treat all Indian fishermen in a humane manner at all times, the release stated.
Initial investigations indicate that the Sri Lanka Navy is not involved in this alleged incident.
Irrespective of the parties involved, if in fact a shooting has taken place, it is a matter of grave concern, and all possible action will be taken in cooperation with the relevant Indian authorities to investigate into this incident, utilizing GPS technology as well, the release added.

Ashwin grabs six as India stun Australia
BANGALORE March 7 Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin grabbed six wickets as India stopped Australia in their tracks to win a fiery second Test and level the series 1-1 on Tuesday.
Australia, needing 188 for victory, were bowled out for just 112 half-an-hour into the final session on day four at Bangalores M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.
Tempers frayed between the worlds top two ranked sides as the hosts bounced back from a humiliating opening Test defeat in Pune.
Ashwin (6-41), who bagged his 25th five-wicket haul in his 47th Test, took the final wicket of Nathan Lyon, caught and bowled for two, sparking celebrations among the Indian players.
After losing the first Test the way we did, we wanted to bounce back and not show anyone but ourselves what we are made of, said India skipper Virat Kohli.
They showed the intent and the belief that we can win from any position. It was about taking responsibility. The way they showed heart and character, along with the crowd, is unbelievable. Cheteshwar Pujara (92) and Ajinkya Rahane (52) put on a crucial 118-run partnership for Indias fifth wicket before the Australian bowlers struck back in the morning session. AFP

bmi regional launches from Birmingham
bmi regional has opened its new base at Birmingham with the launch of flights to Graz, Austria.
Flight BM1401 operated for the first time on February 27. The service is designed to tap into the strong automotive ties between the two cities, with the schedule built around corporate clients requirements. It will initially operate on Mondays and Fridays, rising to four times weekly in March.
A single Embraer ERJ will be based at Birmingham with additional routes to Gothenburg and Nuremberg launching on May 8.
Jochen Schnadt, Chief Commercial Officer for bmi regional, told Airliner World that the carriers research pointed to an untapped market from Birmingham. They might not necessarily be huge markets but given the size of our aircraft we dont necessarily need huge markets, he said. Thats where the research very quickly pointed towards Graz. Nuremberg was hot on its heels in terms of the automotive suppliers based there and Gothenburg has historical ties [to the airline].
Staff from bmi regional and Birmingham Airport celebrate the launch of the carriers new base. 
Schnadt said that despite a short lead-in time to the launch, forward bookings had been encouraging.
With Graz in particular we have very strong engagement with some really key companies.
They have also dictated the schedules to a large extent, he explained. Everybody talks about satisfying the customers, and the same of course applies to us, but I think what is unique to us is we go to great lengths designing networks and schedules around customers specific needs. The schedule you see for Graz is a classic example where it is driven by a particular corporate [client].
One passenger who Airliner World spoke to said the new direct flight will save him a minimum of two hours travelling each week; previously he had to route via either Vienna, Munich or Frankfurt.

CEDAW asks Sri Lanka to amend personal laws
The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) has asked all personal laws be amended to remove discriminatory provisions regulating ownership, inheritance, transfer and disposal of land and property, as well as provisions regulating legal capacity, marriage, divorce, and child custody.
The Committee in its report released on Monday night stated that it was concerned about the lack of progress regarding the reform of discriminatory provisions in the Kandyan Law and the Tesawalamai Law.
The report was based on the 8th submission made by Sri Lanka to CEDAW on its achievements in the womens rights in the country. Thus far the committee has published its findings on Sri Lanka, Ukraine, Ireland, Jordan, El Salvador, Germany, Rwanda, and Micronesia.
The committee also observed that domestic legal framework of the country was yet to be brought in line with the CEDAW convention first signed in 1981 and thus it was important to have greater involvement of women in the ongoing Constitutional reform process.
It recommended the new Constitutional process take into account the need to: include sexual orientation and gender identity as a ground of non-discrimination, in order to clarify any uncertainty as to whether discrimination based on sexual orientation is prohibited under the Right to Equality and to repeal Article 16 (1) of the Constitution, which does not allow judicial review for discriminatory laws which existed prior to the enactment of the Constitution.
The report, which specifically mentioned the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) of 1951, observed that though a Cabinet Sub-Committee was appointed in 2016 to amend the MMDA, the Committee appointed by the Minister of Justice in 2009 to consider and propose reforms to Muslim Personal law and the Quazi courts has not issued any recommendations as of yet.
Given that the MMDA imposed exclusive and compulsory jurisdiction over Muslim marriages, the Committee expressed its particular concern in areas where it did not: (a) specify a minimum age of marriage and girls under 12 years of age are permitted to marry; (b) restricted the legal and judicial officer positions of Quazis, Board of Quazi members, Marriage Registrars and adjudicators to male Muslims only; and,(c) the law on statutory rape is not applicable to girls under 16 years of age who are legally married under Muslim law and who engage in sexual intercourse with their husband while not legally separated.
Sri Lanka was thus recommended to: (a) Prepare a unified family code in conformity with the Convention in which equal rights of women and men in the family relations, including marriage, divorce, inheritance, property and land are addressed; (b) Amend the General Marriage Registration Ordinance to ensure that Muslim women have the free choice to opt out from the Muslim Personal Law, so as to be registered under the general law; (c) Ensure that property rights are governed by general civil contractual and property law rather than religious law; (d) Increase the minimum age of marriage for all women in the State party to 18 years of age; (e) Eliminate any restriction on womens eligibility to be appointed as Quazis, as Members of the Board of Quazis, Marriage Registrars and adjudicators; and, (f) Amend article 363 of the Penal Code to ensure that the crime of statutory rape applies to all girls under the age of 16, without exception in order to abide by the Convention the country is party to.
The committee has asked the state to report back with steps it has taken to rectify the above issues within two years. The next CEDAW review has been set for March 2021.

China calls on N Korea to suspend missile and nuclear tests

China has proposed that North Korea suspend its tests of missile and nuclear technology to "defuse a looming crisis".
Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that in exchange, the US and South Korea could halt annual joint military drills, which consistently infuriate the North.
The appeal comes after North Koreatest-launched four missiles on Monday, breaking international sanctions.
In response, the US began rolling out a missile defence system in South Korea.
Speaking on the sidelines of China's annual parliamentary meeting, Wang said the Korean peninsula was like "two accelerating trains, coming toward each other with neither side willing to give way".
"Are the two sides really ready for a head-on collision" he asked.
A mutual halt of military operations would be the first step towards easing tensions and reopening negotiations, he said.
Thaad 'no threat to China'
Three of the North Korean missiles came down inside Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) on Monday, prompting Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and US President Donald Trump to say the region had entered "a new stage of threat".
The UN Security Council earlier strongly condemned the launch in a unanimous statement, calling it a grave violation of North Korea's international obligations, which risked destabilising the region.
The Council, which will meet later on Wednesday, also threatened to "take further significant measures" against North Korea, which could imply efforts to introduce a fresh round of sanctions.
Meanwhile, the US has again sought to reassure Beijing over deployment of an extensive missile defence system in South Korea.
The Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad) is designed to protect South Korea, and US troops based there, from North Korean missile attacks. The first elements of itwere moved into place on Tuesday, hours after the North's latest launch.
What is the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System (Thaad)
Shoots down short and medium-range ballistic missiles in the terminal phase of their flight
Uses hit-to-kill technology - where kinetic energy destroys the incoming warhead
Has a range of 200km and can reach an altitude of 150km
US has previously deployed it in Guam and Hawaii as a measure against potential attacks from North Korea
What impact will S Korea's expanded missile defence system have
1.The enemy launches a missile
2.The Thaad radar system detects the launch, which is relayed to command and control
3.Thaad command and control instructs the launch of an interceptor missile
4.The interceptor missile is fired at the enemy projectile
5.The enemy projectile is destroyed in the terminal phase of flight
The launcher trucks can hold up to eight interceptor missiles.
The Thaad deployment, originally agreed under the Obama administration, is controversial.
South Koreans living in areas which will host defence batteries are concerned they could become targets.
China has said its radar capabilities go far beyond what is required for defence and represents an encroachment of US military power and that it will "resolutely take necessary measures to defend our own security interest".
At a news briefing on Tuesday, State Department spokesman Mark Toner repeated US reassurances to China.
He said the US had been "very clear in our conversations with China that this is not meant to be a threat, and is not a threat, to them or any other power in the region".
The US was "actively engaged" with its regional partners, he said, to address North Korea's "continuing provocative behaviour and actions".
Toner said that North Korea would be discussed next week when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson makes his first official visits to South Korea, Japan and China.

Emerging from ethnocentric cocoons!
The 30-year-civil war came to an end in Sri Lanka, and the Womens Education and Research Centre (WERC) in Colombo thought to promote three-wheel taxi service providers among women in Jaffna. Their aim was to introduce non-traditional occupations and provide a safe mode of transportation for women in the area if they were to choose a taxi. Ten beneficiaries were chosen for the project. They were trained, helped get driving licences and were given brand new three-wheelers on lease in 2012. A year later, only a couple of women three wheeler drivers remained. The rest had either sold their vehicles or given them to male members of their family. What went wrong
It was not acceptable to have Tamil women driving three-wheelers.
This is an example from the research paper carried out by Dr. Muttukrishna Sarvananthan, Jeyapraba Suresh, and Anushani Alagarajah titled Feminism, Nationalism, and Labour in Post-Civil War Northern Province of Sri Lanka, which speaks of the ethno-feminism, sub-nationalism and other cultural barriers which keep women out of the workforce despite their high education.
When it comes to social indicators such as the Genderrelated Development Index (GDI), Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), and Gender Inequality Index (GII, successor to GEM since 2010) prepared annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Global Gender Gap Index prepared annually by the World Economic Forum (since 2006), Sri Lanka ranks top of South Asian countries, but when it comes to female labour force participation rate, it continues to score a dismal 34-36 percent.
The Northern and the Eastern Provinces show no difference. While these provinces contribute minimum to the countrys GDP, they also have the lowest rate of women labour. The former beating the latter in terms of numbers.
The Department of Census and Statistics in 2012 showed that the Northern Province had the highest female unemployment rates; Kilinochchi 29.4, Mannar 21.6, and Mullaithivu 20.5 percent.
In other districts of the North and East, women unemployment rates were over 10 percent in 2012. In contrast, unemployment rates among men of the North and East were less than 4 percent, Dr. Sarvananthans team research paper points out.
Ironically, women make up the majority (51.5 percent) in the Northern Province. The Jaffna district alone accounted for the highest share of women among the 25 districts in the country.
According to the UN, close of the gender gap in employment could add $12 trillion to global GDP by 2025.
President Maithripala Sirisena on a recent visit to Jaffna to launch his Tell the President hotline observed that the North needed a new strategy to fast track development in the area. As we celebrate Womens Day today, it is important for the President to have the majority of the citizens in these provinces contribute to their labour force and in turn to their development. Hence it is important to study the factors that keep women out of the labour force.
What hold women back
The research as highlighted in the taxi service example showed that some of the main barriers to engaging in work come from within the community or family/household itself or are self-imposed (by women themselves). In a way, women are bound by what the community perceives to be their appropriate role in society and what kind of work they should be doing.
The self, family, or community imposed barriers could be due to societal norms, cultural practices, and/or discriminatory community-based customary laws, the research paper points out and customary laws like the Thesawalamai inheritance laws, which restrict ownership of land to women, make it harder for women to access institutional credit due to lack of collateral.
In addition, women are seen and they themselves are keen on being cultural bearers of their respective community and want to uphold decency and respectability as a reflection of ethno- nationalism.
When it comes to external barriers, workplaces do not seem to promote female labour. The research highlights that sexual harassment and fear of rape stop women from travelling far in search of work; especially in sparsely populated jungle areas of the Vanni: the Kilinochchi, Mannar, Mullaitivu, and Vavuniya districts.
Private businesses are reluctant to hire women as many are seen to be coming with the added responsibilities of child and elderly care duties, frequent absenteeism due to religious fasting negatively impacts the productivity of their business, the research paper points out, is another obstacle for employment.
More importantly, the research brings out ethno-feminism and sub-nationalism of a section of the northern Tamil people in the post-civil war period appear to have been inimical to the economic empowerment of women in the Northern Province. Tamil sub-nationalism argues that intra-community discrimination/marginalisation in terms of caste, class, and gender could not be addressed before the national liberation. Hence, the rights of the sub-groups are subsumed into the rights of the group, the research states.
Subtle sub-nationalism in terms of what jobs are appropriate for women expressed covertly and/or overtly by the local communities (by both men and women) has limited the demand for goods and services thereby dissuading women from continuing their non-traditional vocations, it further explains.
Tamil army women
The best example of this sub-nationalism and ethno-feminism was exposed when the army decided to recruit Tamil women into its fold.
The army, which was mainly a mono-ethnic force, wished to rectify this situation in the aftermath of the civil war and embarked on a programme to recruit Tamil men and women to the Auxiliary Force as a first minor step towards making it a multi-ethnic army.
But the research paper which studied this programme observed, Initially, the Sri Lanka Army (SLA) recruited little over 100 unmarried women in the Kilinochchi and the Mullaitivu districts of the Northern Province (the heartland of the Tamil Tigers) in late-2012, but the programme faced much opposition from A few individual womens rights activists as well as an informal network of Muslim and Tamil womens rights activists in particular and human rights activists in general in the Tamil-dominated Eastern and the Northern Provinces. These groups claimed that such recruitment was not voluntary, that the women were treated as comfort women or sex slaves, and that the families of the women were coerced to allow their daughters or sisters to join the army.
Dr Sarvananthans team used Kanchana Ruwanpuras (2008) observations to remark, While womens groups/networks ameliorate the impact of the high intensity civil war on women, it also controls and monitors womens behaviour.
Despite the vocal opposition, however, four years after the first recruitment, over 90 percent of recruits chose to remain with the army. In 2014, another round of recruitments took place with much less opposition this time around. The foregoing uncorroborated accusations against the Sri Lankan army could have stigmatised the Tamil women (who overwhelmingly appear to have voluntarily joined) and their families more than the army. On the one hand, the Tamils have persistently complained that the Sri Lankan armed forces were deliberately keeping out the Tamils from joining the armed forces and accused them of racism. On the other hand, when Tamils are recruited, the armed forces are accused of using them as sex slaves without any evidence whatsoever. Even a retired Supreme Court Judge noted the research as the reason why a few women had dropped out of the army.
The case of Tamil women being recruited into the army, the research notes was certainly coated with a gender dimension as the recruitment of Tamil men into the Civil Defence Force and the army after the war did not face as much opposition from the Tamil community, Tamil womens rights groups, and Tamil politicians. This paradox, the state wants to have equal recruitment policies while it does not want to apply the policy to the women in the community has left development in the North at stagnation.
The research paper also notes, The foregoing episode reveals the hypocrisy of Tamil ethno-feminism and Tamil sub-nationalism amidst high unemployment rates among women in former conflict-affected districts. Paradoxically, the feminist arguments for overcoming the historical stereotypical gender division of labour are undermined by the open and hidden sub-nationalist sentiments against Tamil women joining the SLA by womens rights activists in the North and elsewhere (including in the Tamil Diaspora). In the end, Women are doubly disadvantaged in conflict/post-conflict or disaster/post-disaster settings because women are used as pawns in the expression of nationalism/sub-nationalism.
Overcoming cultural bias
The barriers found in this research paper, however, are not just limited to the Tamil community, but similar issues of cultural bias are found in all ethnic communities in the country.
UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres in his statement on Womens Day this year too observed, Around the world, tradition, cultural values and religion are being misused to curtail womens rights, to entrench sexism and defend misogynistic practices.
Despite some improvements, leadership positions across the board are still held by men, and the economic gender gap is widening thanks to outdated attitudes and entrenched male chauvinism. We must change this by empowering women at all levels, enabling their voices to be heard and giving them control over their own lives and over the future of our world, Guterres added .
It is internationally accepted that when women participate fully in the labour force, it creates more opportunities and generates growth, but in Sri Lanka we will also have to have women first free themselves of the cultures that cocoon and bind their potential, so they can finally drive that three wheeler or fight to defend our motherland.

Empower woman with more security
Womens rights are human rights. But in these troubled times, as our world becomes more unpredictable and chaotic, the rights of women and girls are being reduced, restricted and reversed.
Empowering women and girls is the only way to protect their rights and make sure they can realize their full potential.
Historic imbalances in power relations between men and women, exacerbated by growing inequalities within and between societies and countries, are leading to greater discrimination against women and girls. Around the world, tradition, cultural values and religion are being misused to curtail womens rights, to entrench sexism and defend misogynistic practices.
Womens legal rights, which have never been equal to mens on any continent, are being eroded further. Womens rights over their own bodies are questioned and undermined. Women are routinely targeted for intimidation and harassment in cyberspace and in real life. In the worst cases, extremists and terrorists build their ideologies around the subjugation of women and girls and single them out for sexual and gender-based violence, forced marriage and virtual enslavement.
Economic gender gap
Despite some improvements, leadership positions across the board are still held by men, and the economic gender gap is widening, thanks to outdated attitudes and entrenched male chauvinism. We must change this, by empowering women at all levels, enabling their voices to be heard and giving them control over their own lives and over the future of our world.
Denying the rights of women and girls is not only wrong in itself; it has a serious social and economic impact that holds us all back. Gender equality has a transformative effect that is essential to fully functioning communities, societies and economies. Womens access to education and health services has benefits for their families and communities that extend to future generations. An extra year in school can add up to 25 per cent to a girls future income.
When women participate fully in the labour force, it creates opportunities and generates growth. Closing the gender gap in employment could add $12 trillion to global GDP by 2025. Increasing the proportion of women in public institutions makes them more representative, increases innovation, improves decision-making and benefits whole societies.
Sexual exploitation and abuse
Gender equality is central to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the global plan agreed by leaders of all countries to meet the challenges we face. Sustainable Development Goal 5 calls specifically for gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, and this is central to the achievement of all the 17 SDGs.
I am committed to increasing womens participation in our peace and security work. Women negotiators increase the chances of sustainable peace, and women peacekeepers decrease the chances of sexual exploitation and abuse.
Within the UN, I am establishing a clear road map with benchmarks to achieve gender parity across the system, so that our organisation truly represents the people we serve. Previous targets have not been met. Now we must move from ambition to action.
On International Womens Day, let us all pledge to do everything we can to overcome entrenched prejudice, support engagement and activism, and promote gender equality and womens empowerment.

Etihad Airways continues sustainability drive across its global airline fleet
Etihad Airways, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, has continued to make improvements in the fuel efficiency of its fleet, resulting in substantial reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and reinforcing the sustainability credentials of the airline.
The airlines dedicated fuel efficiency team drove numerous initiatives across all operational functions of the business, saving over 60,000 tonnes of fuel.
Fuel consumption is influenced by many factors such as the aircraft and engine type, the weight being carried and the duration of the flight. The airline is working on several key initiatives to optimise efficiency, both with the aircraft itself and through external collaboration with aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus.
Fuel burn performance is negatively impacted by seasonal fog, requiring additional holding fuel to be carried, inbound to Abu Dhabi and the airline is now collaborating with the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi to enable more accurate fog predictions.
Airport staff are also supporting efforts to ensure that ground power is used instead of the auxiliary power unit when aircraft are on the ground. The environmental benefits are not only substantial but the efficiency improvement in 2016 compared to 2015 exceeds the emissions reduction goal that the industry has set itself, currently a 1.5% efficiency improvement across international aviation.

FAI phases out last  Learjet 35A
Nuremberg-based special mission operator FAI rent-a-jet has bid farewell to its last Learjet 35A, D-COKE (c/n 447). The aircraft has been sold to Jet Rescue Air Ambulance of Mexico and has been reregistered XA-DOC. It was handed over to the CEO of the Mexican firm, Carlos Salinas, during a ceremony at Albrecht Duerer International Airport in Nuremberg on February 26.
FAIs decision to retire the Learjet 35A is based on rising demand for larger cabins in the air ambulance market as well as economic factors.
The German firm had operated four Learjet 35As, clocking up 38,000 hours across the fleet.
Today is an emotional day. This Learjet type was our first Learjet aircraft and served as the engine for the companys growth in the field of air ambulance, said FAIs Founder and Chairman, Siegfried Axtmann. I hope that it will perform many happy landings for its new owner.
FAIs group fleet now consists of two Learjet 55s, 11 Learjet 60s, five Challenger 604s, three Global Express, a Premier 1A and a King Air 350. Another Challenger 604 and Global are due to be added shortly.
Sooner or later FAI will also outsource its remaining two Learjet 55 models by replacing them with Learjet 60s and we will be in the good position of operating only two different aircraft models (Learjet 60 and Challenger 604) across our worldwide air ambulance service, added Axtmann.

FR challenging COPE report re-fixed for support
The Fundamental Rights petition filed by Ven. Thiniyawala Palitha Thera challenging the various findings and statements made in a report prepared by the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) regarding the Bond issues by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in the year of 2015 and 2016 was yesterday re-fixed for support on May 18 by the Supreme Court.
When the petition came up before the three-judge-bench comprising Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice Upaly Abeyratne, the Court was informed that several COPE committee members were yet to appear in Courts as respondents.
The petitioner Sri Lanka Mahabodhi Society Vice Secretary Ven. Thiniyawala Palitha Thera had cited 26 members of COPE including its chairman Sunil Hadunnetti who have been tasked by Parliament of Sri Lanka to investigate and report on matters pertaining to certain Treasury Bond auctions, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, the Governor of the CBSL, Chairman of the Tender Committee of the CBSL and Superintendent of the Public Debt Department of the CBSL, the Auditor General of Sri Lanka and the Attorney General as respondents in the petition.
The petitioner stated that consequent to being elected in September 2015, Parliament of Sri Lanka appointed the members of COPE to conduct an investigation into certain Central Bank auctions of Treasury Bonds which occurred in February 2015 and March 2016.
The members of COPE have submitted their final report to Parliament on or about 28 October 2016.
The said COPE report maintains that the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th 18th, 21st, 22nd, 24th and 26th Respondents agreed to the said COPE report in general without the footnotes.
The 6th,7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 20th, 23rd and 25th Respondents agreed to the said COPE report with the footnotes.
All members of the Committee (i.e. the1st to 26th Respondents) unanimously agreed to the recommendations given at the end of the report.
The Petitioner expressly pleads that notwithstanding that the said COPE report was presented to Parliament on or about 28 October 2016, the same remained inaccessible to the general public and the Petitioner for some time.
The Petitioner pleads that the said COPE report only became accessible to the Petitioner on or about 24 November 2016.
In the circumstances afore-said, the Petitioner pleads that the Petitioner could not file this application sooner as the COPE report was inaccessible to him, and he was not aware of the contents of the same, until 24 November 2016. The Petitioner further stated that in any event the continuous reliance or circulation or actions of the said COPE report as it presently stands amounts to a continuing infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, and also amounts to a cause which enables the Petitioner to prefer this application in the public interest.
The Petitioner pleads that through the said COPE report, the Petitioner and the general public have been misinformed and misled.
The Petitioner said that in the event that the CBSL was not properly or officially or lawfully issuing Treasury Bonds viz the direct/private placement from the month of January 2009, the proper procedure that ought to have been followed from January 2009 was the Central Bank Treasury bond auction process.
The Petitioner further stated that instead of reporting the above to Parliament and the general public, the said COPE report is littered with inconsistencies or contradictions or misrepresentations, which the Petitioner pleads makes certain findings and statements in the COPE report unsafe, or prejudiced or biased, and a violation/ infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka.
The Petitioner and the general public of Sri Lanka are entitled to receive a fair, impartial and truthful investigation into such matters, which is free from bias and ulterior/political objectives. 65.
The Petitioner states that by the glaring contradictions and/or inconsistencies and/or misrepresentations contained in the said COPE report, the members of the COPE committee [i.e. the 1st to 26th Respondents] have not fulfilled their duties and obligations to the Petitioner [and other members of the general public of Sri Lanka].
The petitioner is seeking an Order or Declare that any express or implied finding and statement and suggestion in the said COPE report that the direct/private placement method in the issue of Treasury Bonds by the Central Bank has been properly, lawfully and correctly used by the Central Bank from the month of January 2009 up until the date of the COPE report, is wrongful.
The petitioner is further seeking an Order or Declare that as at the time of the Treasury Bond auctions of the Central Bank that was held on 27 February 2015 and 29 March 2016, the proper, lawful process or method as regards the issue of Treasury Bonds was the auction process/method, and not the direct/private placement process/method.

Govt. can seek compensation for losses
Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya has informed Parliament that the government can seek compensation for relevant parties in the event it incurred any loss in the Treasury Bond issue of the Central Bank.
The Attorney General has informed Parliament that he has instructed the Director of the CID to expedite criminal investigations on the written complaint made by the Central Bank Governor on the Treasury Bonds issue on February 27, 2015.
He had also directed the CID to report about the progress of the investigations to the Attorney Generals Department.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday in Parliament tabled a letter received from the Attorney General in reply to the COPE report referred to him.
The AG in his letter had also pointed out,the content of the COPE report points to the possibility of several transgressions known to the law, including market manipulation,insider dealing and non-compliance with mandatory procedure.
The AG has also observed the possibility for the Government to seek compensation from the relevant parties if it had incurred any liability at this instance.
In terms of Section 21D of the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance, in the event of Government incurring any liability or making payment of any sum due as principal, interest or redemption proceeds with regard to Treasury Bonds, and where such liability arises or such payment is made in consequence, or by reason of any default of a direct participant or a dealer direct participant, such participant shall be liable on demand by the Government, to indemnify the Government with respect to such liability or payment the letter said.
However, the AG has also noted that a reasonable estimation of damages assessed by a method that could be substantiated before a court of law would be required, and for this purpose the Government would have to provide a precise quantification of the loss it suffered. The said quantification should be carried out by the Auditor Generals Department, with the assistance of an independent expert or experts whose evidence can be relied upon in a court of law the AG said in the letter.
In order to consider the possibility of criminal prosecution against a particular person or entity being initiated under the aforesaid provision or any other law, an investigation based on a complaint to the police on a complaint would be a prerequisite the letter further stated.
In addition to aforesaid civil and criminal remedies, the Central Bank is entitled to exercise regulatory powers over primary dealers in terms of inter alia regulation 11(2) and 12 of the Registered Stocks and Securities (Primary Dealers) Regulations No.1 of 2009 and Section 21D of the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and also under Section 56A of the Ordinance and the Code of Conduct of Primary Dealers, he added in the letter.

Govt cannot change courts verdict: Kiriella
During the previous regime, protest marches were held to accept the verdict of the Court, but today, protest marches are being held to reject the the Court's verdict. The Court has given a verdict to accept SAITM, and the government cannot change a Courts verdict, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
SAITM was not commenced by our government, but by the previous government. It is during our governments term that the first batch of students graduated, he said. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa granted Rs.600 million to commence SAITM, but no one spoke against SAITM back in the day because they were afraid of being taken away in white vans.
The minister stated these views during an observation tour at a branch of the Institute of Technology, University of Moratuwa, (ITUM) in Diyagama, Homagama, to inspect the final phase of the construction of a new building complex on March 6. Under the direction of the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways, the building complex is being constructed at a cost of Rs. 10.2 billion and is inclusive of a student and teacher hostel, fully facilitated auditoriums, laboratories, and a 1,400-seat lecture hall. Constructed in accordance to international standards, the building complex is expected to be completed within this year.
He said, "It was the United National Party (UNP) that first introduced free education to the country. Therefore, we will preserve the free education system. It was also the UNP who first began distributing free textbooks and uniform materials to students."
"Our government has planned to commence two new medical universities in the Wayamba and Ratnapura areas. These will be state universities, not private ones," he said.
The minister said, "I request the university students to end their class strike and re-engage in their studies. Many external forces are manipulating university students to accomplish their political needs. A house used for ragging by students of the University of Peradeniya was found a few weeks ago. It is people like this who maintain such torture chambers that participate in protest marches against the government."
"Our government is ready to listen to the people of this country, but not people who engage in such vile acts. No beneficial developments towards the medical profession will outcome by these protests being held. All these protests and rallies are being held with a political motive. So, dont fall prey to these sly schemes. People maintaining torture chambers cannot make decisions regarding the countrys educational and health policies," the minister said.

High level delegation from Shanghai visits BOI
The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka recently hosted a delegation consisting of senior officials from Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference of Shanghai (CPPCC).
The delegation consisted of six senior officials of the communist party of China (Shanghai chapter) and was led by Xu Yibo, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC Shanghai Committee. The delegation had come on a fact finding mission to develop a greater co-operation between China and Sri Lanka.
In the course of their visit, the delegation inspected the infrastructure in Sri Lanka notably the Port and International Airport at Hambantota.
The delegation was welcomed by BOI Chairman Upul Jayasuriya,who briefed them on the role of the BOI as the sole Sri Lanka Government institution established by law to attract Foreign Direct Investment. He added that by law the BOI is empowered to sign agreements with companies, to set up investment projects in Sri Lanka.
The Chairman stated that Sri Lanka is the most business friendly country in South Asia and has entered into free trade agreements with both India and China. This signifies that if any of 4000 identified items are produced in Sri Lanka with 35% value added. These products can be exported to India to Pakistan duty free. Hence Sri Lanka was the gateway to South Asia and Chinese enterprises may seriously consider investing Sri Lanka to access those very large South Asian markets.
Jayasuriya told the delegation that Sri Lanka's relations with China had been particularly friendly. Currently the Portcity project is progressing at a speed. Furthermore China has built in Hambantota both the Port and International Airport. And the Government also signed an agreement on the Hambantota Port where Chinese companies can be established.
At a political level there had been the visit of China's President Xi Jinping to Sri Lanka and also the visit by Sri Lanka's President to China. However relations between the two countries go back a long time.
In 1949 Sri Lanka recognized the People's Republic of China, the first non-communist country to do so. In fact in 1952 the two countries signed the Rice-Rubber Pact where China bought Sri Lankan rubber from more than the market price and Sri Lanka got access to 250,000 metric tons of rice from China at a time when the island suffered an acute shortage.
China and Sri Lanka have extended into many agreements including Trade Co-operation (1982) Investment Protection (1986) and double taxation avoidance (2003). Since 2013 Sri Lanka and China are engaged in negotiation to enter into a Free Trade Agreement.
Hence relations have been excellent and there was a need to look at the future andstrengthen relations even further. Jayasuriya also told the Chinese side that Sri Lanka is currently engaged in the transformation of the City of Colombo. He added that the first stage is the transformation around Beira Lake,where there is considerable opportunities for investment. Hence Chinese enterprises who are interested in investing overseas should seriously consider this excellent opportunity.
Jayasuriya said the BOI has the statute and power to grant visas for fast movement into Sri Lanka. There is a double taxation agreement between both countries. He concluded by requesting the Chinese delegation to invite investors to visit Sri Lanka in the future and also to nominate a contact person to coordinate contacts between Sri Lanka and Shanghai.

How an atom divided humans
As a participant observer of the Chinese postwar and pre-war agrarian sector, I had the chance of rediscovering some of the latent human conditions, which enabled me to set most of my narratives in that social milieu, said the 1938 Nobel Laureate Pearl S Buck (1892  1973) in her Nobel address.
Pearl with her lesser known name S for Sysdestricker happened to be Americas most distinguished woman of letters ad the winner of both Pulitzer prize (1932) and Nobel Prize for literature in 1938.
Her most popular novel The Good Earth happened to be a narrative translated so far into 48 languages around the world. This work not only helped the world to gauge the susceptibilities of the traditional agrarian culture in China, but a mirror of the most agrarian societies in the East. Pearl S Buck was thoughtful to her parents who happened to visit China in the early part of the 20th century as missionaries and social workers. As Pearl reads this as a god-given mission for her creative activities.
While the parents were busy with their social activities, Pearl was engaged in the function of reading her fathers books, a part of which was kept n backyard barn. Pearl would go there there during the morning hours, as a way of life in order to browse the books written by English writers like Dickens and Hardy. According to notes kept by Pearl from her childhood days, paved the way for her to know herself, the latent skills of writing as an observer. She kept abreast ith the games played by Chinese girls and boys of her age not as a foreigner but as a participant ho did not feel the alienation of human conditions. As she records the affection resulted in the lifelong devotion to children especially the lost children, the orphaned the handicapped, those of mixed parentage etc.
In 1949, after receiving the Nobel award Pearl founded welcome house which locates home for orphans of mixed Asian  American heritage. As soon as she found the home she raised nine adopted children in addition to her own. She told the world at large in one of her essays that her own daughter, a child who did not grow. But in the Welcome House, she grewup with other children of her age. She too founded her Pearl S Buck Foundation not as a ersnal belonging, but as a philanthropic activity. Her earnings from books were geared tot the well being of those who mattered. She recorded at one point: My books were written by me in order to release myself from a burden. Now they belong to the world not as a personal belonging but as a public property.
Pearl S Buck emphasizes the fact that the philanthropic activities in the war torn world should centre round rescuing children left in foreign lands by American servicemen. That as a forgotten factor, which too became the central then to some of the novels like Anniversary, Sons and Command the Morning. In the novel titled Command the Morning, Pearl S Buck has written about the most awesome achievements of our time: the splitting of the atom and the manufacture of ht atomic bomb. She takes the reader into lives of scientists responsible for the creation of the fearful weapon and shows the greatest disaster that ever happened to the humans.
Pearl S Buck sensitively captures in the work the sequence of events in the creation of the bomb and the way led to the disaster. Burton Hall, the head of the project and his ife Mollie, his young assistant Stephen Coast and his wife Helen and the skilful, intelligent young scientist Jane Earl, attracted to both males, yet afraid to allow herself to love either makes the narrative line more sensitive. The human lovelorn characters are gradually shifted into an inhuman action.
The narrative bears a religious epitaph which stands as an epitome.
Gird up now thy loins like a man
For I will demand of them
And answer thou me
Where was thou when I laid foundations of the Earth
Declare, if thou has understanding
Then the lord answered Job out of whirlwind and said:
Who hast laid the measures thereof
If thou knowest
Or who hath stretched the line upon it
Whereupon are the foundations there of fastened
Or who laid the cornerstone thereof
When the morning stars sang together
And all the sons of god shouted the joy
The penetrative narrative vision of Pearl Buck surpassed the mere plotting of a story or giving vent to a suspense. Instead, she makes the reader grip into a human situation packed with history and event
The year was 1940. In September of 1939, England had declared war against Germany. But it was spring again, and Americans were still safe, Yes Burton was thinking, we are still safe This is how the novel Command triggers off into a tragedy of human existence. Pearl shows how the common man drawn to a grave tragedy while the scientist highly paid are engaged in scientific activities which drive humans to that disaster.
As the epilogue to the work Pearl S Buck laid down what a physicist named Sam Allison says:
Nuclear power liberated;
The creation of Plutonium
1943  1944
Hail miracle, which these dreadful years
We built urged on by hopes and goaded by fears
Hail man made star
God help us how aspire
To fan spent embers left from cosmic fire.

## Title: OF HUBS, PORT CITIES AND THE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

OF HUBS, PORT CITIES AND THE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS
Sri Lanka is essentially an island and is advantaged by having an excellent location at the crossroads of many of the international sealanes. In the Indian Ocean few countries can boast of a better location, close to some of the fastest growing countries in Asia, the world economic powerhouse and to other regions such as the Persian Gulf, Africa and Oceania.
This idea of being a hub has always been deeply ingrained in the psyche of the Sri Lankan people and has indeed shaped the islands history and its world view.
In todays global context, many outside observers see the Sri Lankan population as being very cosmopolitan, adaptable, tolerant, and capable of absorbing concepts and ideas from many parts of the world - a truly globalized people.
Records of foreign travellers
Historically, this openness to the outside world had resulted in considerable wealth from trade with the region and beyond. There is considerable evidence from the discovery of ancient Chinese porcelain, from coins and other objects and the records of foreign travellers such as Pliny, Ptolemy, FaHien, Ibn Battuta and Marco Polo, that the island interacted commercially with Ancient Greece, Imperial Rome, the Arab caliphates, imperial China and Sassanian Persia.
The large quantity of these objects found in the island has led many observers to theorize that Sri Lanka was indeed an entrepot for trade with much of the ancient world. As a trading nation Sri Lanka enjoyed considerable wealth which is visible in the form of stupas barely less tall than the great pyramids of Egypt, gigantic irrigation tanks and palaces, which were no doubt built with the exports of trade in spices, ivory, elephants, peacocks and even steel.
However to understand this wealth it is necessary to really see Sri Lanka not in isolation but as part of a highly complex trading system connecting countries and cities in Asia and beyond.
Regional trading community
In many ways there are modern parallels as we currently seek to develop the country as a logistics hub and to connect it successfully to the global supply chain.
This idea of a regional trading community connecting countries and resulting in the sharing of knowhow, technology and indeed of ideas is the subject of a very fine exhibition that this writer was privileged to view at the Museum of Asian Civilizations in Singapore.
The exhibition which is titled Port Cities deals with the emergence of trading hubs in the Asian Region.
The cities in question featured in the exhibition included not just Temasek, (the old name for Singapore) but also a number of cities dotted throughout Asia such as the booming Chinese port city of Xiamen, which this writer also visited recently, and linked together through an extensive and highly complex network of international trade.
What make these cities distinctive was not just their location which are highly strategic but also their wealth, their very cosmopolitan culture and non-typical environment.
Ethnically speaking they are booming markets that acted as gathering points where Chinese, Malays, Indian, Arabs and later Europeans were actively engaged in exchanging goods through trade. However the exhibition focused not just on the trade of goods but also examined the exchange of knowhow and ideas. It would be correct to say that the Port Cities are among the first megapolises.
One characteristic of the port cities was the emergence of populations of mixed ethnicity with very distinctive hybrid cultures, cosmopolitan ideas and also what could be considered a global world view.
Western maritime powers
The port cities of Asia had an ancient history but they would undergo major upheavals with the emergence in Asia of the western maritime powers: the Portuguese and Spanish followed by the Dutch and the British.
From being on the periphery of the trading system and essentially traders seeking to bring back to Europe rare spices and other treasures, the European powers would through superior military technology and a ruthless exploitation of local divisions, emerge as the key players in the trading systems through colonialism.
In spite of this they would still have to contend with the elephant in the room, Asias oldest culture and leading power, Imperial China.
Interestingly in those times, like today, the Middle Kingdom was the centre of production of consumer goods and was undoubtedly the cornerstone of the trading system. These goods such as silk, porcelain and tea were traded to the known world through Asias port cities. And only China seemed capable of meeting the growing demand.
In fact Imperial China even produced goods aimed at different, distinctive markets. There were porcelain goods with western designs that went to Europe, while others with Arabic calligraphic inscriptions were shipped to Asias other global power, the Ottoman Empire and porcelain decorated with Persian miniatures found their way to the Savafid Empire.
This was proof of the existence of a highly sophisticated the market but also of one where the products reflected the fusion of different cultures.
This rich mixing of style and cultures was not restricted to products from China.
One exhibit of interest to the readership of this article is an exquisite carved ivory chest, made by Sinhalese craftsmen but in a European, Christian style. The object, which was part of the exhibition, had been the personal property of the King of Portugal.
Hence it would be correct to say that many of the ideas which we have about developing Sri Lanka into an economic hub, of strengthening her links to the leading markets of the world through a comprehensive network of Free Trade Agreements or even for that matter Chinas ambitious One Belt One Road Strategic initiative to integrate Asia, Africa, the middle East and Europe in a modern day silk route, have historic origins that go back to the very early times when port cities traded acted as meeting points for many cultures which traded in spices, tea and porcelain and exchanged know how and ideas.

Humankind depends on strength of empowered women: President
"We are in unanimous agreement that the sustainable existence of the humankind depends on the strength of the empowered women. That is why the sustainable development goals of the United Nations Organization prioritize the plan to empower all women and female children within the next 15 years," President Maithripala Sirisena in his message to mark the International Women's Day states.
The message states, Sri Lanka recognizes the motherhood as precious. However, the recognition does not provide sufficient protection to the entire feminine community. Therefore, the government in its endeavour to achieve the sustainable development, has to implement pragmatic programme to ensure the identity and the protection of Sri Lankan women and to give them an opportunity to engage in the development process," the President states.
"It is a matter for satisfaction that the women in Sri Lanka, comprising more than half the population of Sri Lanka, have achieved development indicators to the level of the developed countries in the world.
The Sri Lankan women is ahead of her male counterpart in literacy and life expectancy. Today, the Sri Lankan women are taking the highest burden of our economy.
"It is our objective to further expand the steps taken by our government during the last two years to enhance the women's contribution in the management and the political decision making machinery, in order to empower the multiple roles of Sri Lankan women.
I expect the intervention and the cotribution of women's organizations, women activists and all relevant parties in this regard.
"I wish the programmes on the International Women's Day which are organized under the theme "She Envisions Past, Present and Future - Victorious Thorough Efforts," with the objective of establishing the respectful position of the Sri Lankan women every success. I commend all those who make relentless efforts to achieve the goals of the International Women's Day.

I am eager to score a double hundred  Mendis
GALLE: Sri Lankas number three batsman Kusal Mendis said that he was keen to make it big and score a double hundred after finishing the first day of the first Test against Bangladesh unbeaten on 166.
I missed getting one at Pallekele (against Australia) so I am determined to make one here, said Mendis yesterday.
I am a set batsman and the team expects me to score big. I will try my best to score 200 if not more. It is a good batting wicket and I dont see it taking any changes in the next few days, by evening it might take spin. It is a hard wicket and I believe there are runs on it, he said. Recalling the first ball reprieve Mendis said, I may have played a false stroke the first ball I faced but thats the way I play naturally. When I got a second opportunity I took that advantage to provide my team with what they required from me. Dimuth (Karunaratne) spoke to me a lot after I played that first shot he told me to leave the balls you cannot play alone. Asela (Gunaratne) also told me the same. Everyone who came to the wicket spoke to me. Initially it was difficult to go for the runs. Off the first 45 balls I faced, I scored only 10 to 15, but later on because we had wickets in hand we went for the runs. When I was in partnership with Asela we ran a lot of singles and when I was tired he scored runs from the other end. That was very helpful to me. He also played well but unfortunately for him he got out. It was easy batting with him. (ST)

IMF: Speed up delayed reforms, watch inflation
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has commended authorities for efforts in implementing the IMF-supported economic reform program with all fiscal quantitative targets being met through end-December.
The IMF Mission in Sri Lanka submitting its report said substantial progress has been made in stepping up revenue collections and automating revenue administration, which has been the basis for meeting fiscal targets. However, net international reserves fell short of the target and progress on implementing structural benchmarks was somewhat uneven with some of the reforms lagging behind intended timelines. Accordingly, the mission and the authorities have discussed decisive actions to maintain the reform momentum in light of uncertain external environment. A staff team from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led by Jaewoo Lee visited Colombo from February 21 to March 7, to hold discussions on the second review of the Sri Lankan authorities economic program that is being supported by a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
The mission made significant progress toward reaching a staff level agreement with the government on completion of the second review. Discussions will continue in April in Washington D.C. during the Spring Meetings of the IMF and World Bank.
Overall, macroeconomic performance in the second half of 2016 was mixed with gradually recovering growth and an uptick in inflation due to the impact of drought and the VAT increase. The current account remained stable, but the financial account weakened with the resumption of capital outflows. A more prolonged drought could raise food and oil imports with adverse impact on growth, inflation, and the balance of payment.
To this end, it is important for the government to continue on the revenue based fiscal consolidation and generate adequate resources to support its social and development objectives while maintaining debt sustainability. Notably, advancing the legislative process for the new Inland Revenue Act, with effective public consultations, is a critical step towards rebalancing the tax system toward a more predictable, efficient and equitable structure.
The mission also encourages the government to accelerate implementation of structural reforms in public financial management and state owned enterprises (SOEs), building on the substantial technical assistance received so far. In this regard, finalizing and publishing Statements of Corporate Intents for large SOEs is the first necessary step for enhancing transparency and accountability in the reform process. The mission also supports the ongoing work to design reforms in the business environment and competitiveness which are supported by a number of development partners.
The mission encourages the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to remain vigilant in monitoring inflation pressures and stand ready to tighten monetary policy if inflation or credit growth does not abate. In light of mounting external pressures, the mission encourages the CBSL to take stronger actions towards rebuilding international reserves and maintaining exchange rate flexibility. In this regard, the mission and the authorities discussed IMF technical assistance to facilitate transition to flexible inflation targeting framework.

A lake in Australia has turned flamingo pink

Lakes aren't supposed to be pink. And yet, here's this one in Australia boasting a bright flamingo colour.
The new colour of this salt lake in Victoria, Melbourne, is due to a perfect storm of circumstances: warm weather, sunlight, little rain, and very high salt levels.
The Westgate Park, which houses the salt lake, is located in the southern tip of Australia.
The park system said algae growing in the salt crust at the bottom of the lake produces the red pigment.
That's beta carotene, and the algae produce it as part of its photosynthesis process -- and due to the extremely high salt levels.
By the way, beta carotene is also the reason why flamingo feathers are pink. They eat algae that are loaded with the stuff.
The lake is predicted to lose its vibrant colour - and return to boring blue - by wintertime.

Laws will be introduced to make life insurance compulsory for all workers engaged in risky employments.
The compensation paid to the family on behalf of a deceased worker will be doubled, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said.
He said so at a discussion at his ministry with regard to recent deaths of workers attached to factories such as Bogala Mine, dhal factory etc. Last year, 246 factory workers died due to accidents.
According to Minister Seneviratne, the current Rs. 550,000 death compensation will be increased to Rs. 1.1 million. Several amendments will be brought to the Sri Lanka Factories Ordinance Number 45 of 1942 to ensure the safety of workers engaged in risky employments.
Minister Seneviratne said the Labour Department takes legal action against factory owners who violate the Sri Lanka Factories Ordinance Number 45 of 1942.
It is decided to recruit 100 more engineers to inspect risky factories. The current engineering team is not adequate to carry out inspections, the minister said.
It is also expected to create a new position entailing engineering knowledge to further strengthen and expand the inspection of risky factories, he added.

M S Fernando and the sound of baila
Wally Bastian, acknowledged father of baila, nurtured and refined it and then brought it to the Sinhala middle-class. He hailed from the coastal fringes of the metropolis. He grew up on church hymns and the rigidity this entailed pushed him to liberate, to experiment, and to perform. That is why those who played around with baila almost always came from the same background. Almost all of them emerged from the hub of what someone once referred to as the music of the middle, Moratuwa. It is from Moratuwa that the pioneers of this middle music emerged. Including M. S. Fernando, this weeks star.
If Wally authored an entire genre, Fernando helped sustain the wave it unleashed. His creativity knew no bounds. He sang, he wrote, he performed. He made you dance even if you didnt understand what he was trying to put out in his melodies. Then again, though, you didnt need to comprehend any message in his work: you came, you saw, you listened, and you let him enthral you. His best songs, in this regard, were those who had a large hand in shaping. He couldnt open up otherwise. Were he alive today, he would have turned 81 last Saturday. He was 58 when he left us.
Creative sensibilities
I have heard stories about the man, of how he could come up onstage impromptu and go on gibbering lines which, if you listened hard enough, actually made sense. To say that he lived for baila would be putting it too mildly, because he didnt just live it, he breathed it. In one sense, Clarence Wijewardena, Stanley Peiris, Sunil Perera, and their descendants today owe him considerably. He helped them refine the genre he let out. For that to happen, he had to let his creative sensibilities open up, unfiltered.
He was born on March 4, 1936 in (where else) Moratuwa. He was educated at St Anthonys College in Mt Lavinia and later at Christ Church College in Dehiwela. Channa Bandara Wijekoon, in an article written to this paper years ago, records that he came under the influence of J. A. Sathiadasan, who wound up as his guru. Perhaps that helped him, perhaps not. We do not know. What we do know is that young M. S. was gifted with an ability to turn whatever situation to his advantage, coming up with melodies that enthralled everyone. Like Jothipala, his talent was born with him, raw and unpeeled.
He broke into the music industry through a duet with Pushparani Ariyaratne, Malak Kada Konde Gasala, the lyrics to which were written by Karunaratne Abeysekera. This was followed by another hit, Sili Siliye Nawa Suwandak for the 1964 film Sasaraka Hati. Again, it was authored by Abeysekera, who at the time fathered an entire generation of performers. In the end, having fathered M. S., he empowered the man to sing for over 150 films, ranging from the good to the forgettable. With them, he got to work with several composers, though the composer (and writer) he worked best with was himself, completely and purely.
Pure avatar
Before I get to this complete and pure M. S. though, I will sketch out his collaborations with other composers. Of these, I would personally rate Clarence and Khemadasa highly, not because he couldnt take to other artistes but because he came very close to reflecting that complete and pure avatar of himself with them. Listen to the melodies these two got out of him  Khemadasa gave us Rom Rasa Berena and Eran Kanda Pem Handa, while Clarence gave us Dili Dili Dilisena Eliyak  and listen to them again in the context of the melodies he worked with.
To be sure, no two composers could have been more different. Both were experimenters. Khemadasa, however, almost always was spare with brass instruments, and inadvertently toned down the vocal intensity of nearly every singer he worked with (including Jothipala). M. S. was no exception: even in as open textured a song as Rom Rasa Berena (from Rana Giraw), you feel that the composer has suppressed the full range of the mans voice, while in Eran Kanda Pem Handa (from Nedeyo) you feel that he is trying to prove that the man can just as easily croon as he can bellow. Not surprisingly, with Clarence he was qualitatively different, almost a different artiste: Dili Dili Dilisena Eliyak (from Sikuruliya), for instance, is vintage M. S.
Firmly rooted
Fernandos legacy, which I pointed out at the beginning, lies in how he sustained the wave that Wally Bastian unleashed. He sustained it best when he was his own writer and composer. To understand why, we need to understand the art-form he promoted. Baila, as those who love it know, is an individualist genre, firmly rooted in the artistes vision of the world. That vision comes out best unfiltered, without being refined by collaborators. The signature of a baila tune, in other words, is the signature of the performer, who constitutes all the three elements of that song.
Fernandos signature was his sympathy for defeated people, who revelled in their defeats and happy-go-lucky lifestyles. He neither apologises for nor preaches against them. In fact, he doesnt make us feel they deserve our sympathy at all: all he tries to do is transform a persons state of poverty to pathos: in other words, the pathetic and the dull to the sublime and hilarious. Its as though M. S. (the narrator, not performer) is testing his patience (and ours), flaunting the fact that he is now loaded so as to indulge and invest in a light-hearted life. In other words, he deliberately brings up a contrast between the now and the before, not so much to brag as to tentatively lavish and spend on everything he earlier couldnt.
Whether or not you agree with his stance here, you can take his song as either a parable against consumerism or an indictment on the listeners who virtually resided in his songs: living for the moment, wasting their lives away, having no any plan or buffer. The qualifier to this, which was his signature, is that he evoked sympathy and love, not dislike and indifference, for them.
Small wonder
In fact pretty much every baila singer pandered to this mindset. M. S. was no exception: he spoke for the poor, those who wanted to enjoy the lives they barely survived, and contended (rather impishly) that we should all try to live (not exist), enjoy, and share that enjoyed life. The dichotomy that this revealed  between the life he wanted us to enjoy and the manifest lack of security and money needed to sustain such a lifestyle  defines the best baila melodies. Even today. Small wonder, then, that his work was shirked by a conventional society, a society that emphasised on thrift over spending.
I can write more, but owing to spatial constraints I shall not. I must hence end, but on what note
As an art-form and a cultural signifier, baila has almost always infuriated academic circles. With the sole (and I daresay laudable) exception of Sunil Ariyaratne, who wrote extensively on the genre, writers and professors considered it as culturally castrated. What they forgot, which Ariyaratne did and has not, was that baila owes as much to our love for nonsense and the subtle meaning that even nonsense can unearth as it does to our penchant for leading carefree, happy-go-lucky lives. How could it not be ours, then
Going by that, I fervently believe that the veterans of this denigrated and barely understood art-form will one day join their better hailed contemporaries. Until then, we can listen, we can enjoy, and we can live. That is what M. S. taught us, and that is what he continues to teach us. Always.

Mendis denied double ton as Sri Lanka post 494 against Bangladesh

Kusal Mendis was agonisingly denied a maiden double century as Sri Lanka posted a score of 494 before Bangladesh made a steady start to their reply in the first Test Wednesday.
Bangladesh were 31 without loss at tea on the second day at the Galle International Stadium after Mendis was dismissed for 194 as he tried to reach his double ton in style.
Tamim Iqbal caught Mendis on the boundary ropes at long-on, off teenage off-spinner Mehedi Hasan, as the right-handed batsman attempted an audacious six.
Tamim ran backwards to take the catch, lobbing the ball back into the field as his feet crossed the boundary ropes and then pouching it again.
Mendis faced 294 balls and struck 19 fours and four sixes in his seven-and-a-half-hour stay on the crease.
The 22-year-old, who was unbeaten on 166 overnight, was earlier granted a reprieve by a no-ball on the first delivery he faced.
He was almost dismissed when he struck his first six of the morning as Mustafizur Rahman took a catch off the bowling of Subashis Roy but stepped on the rope on the fine leg boundary.
Spinner Mehedi took four wickets for 113 runs. After Mendis walked, Mehedi dismissed Niroshan Dickwella as the wicketkeeper batsman gave a catch to Mahmudullah at midwicket after making 75 off 76 balls.
Dickwella, who hit six fours and a six in his quick-fire innings, put on 110 with Mendis for the fifth wicket off just 124 balls.
Mustafizur then removed Rangana Herath for 14 and Suranga Lakmal was run out for eight to give Bangladesh some respite.
Mehedi trapped Dilruwan Perera leg-before on 51 before taking a stunning catch to send last man Lakshan Sandakan packing off Shakib Al Hasan.

Mendis makes maximum out of no-ball reprieve
GALLE: When Kusal Mendis inside edged a catch behind the wicket off the first ball he received and was given a reprieve by the head umpire who ruled that delivery a no-ball as the bowler Subash Roy had overstepped the crease he would have known that Lady Luck was certainly on his side.

Following that awful first shot he played that nearly cost him his wicket Mendis from there onwards hardly put a foot wrong as he made his way towards his second Test century in 15 matches to put Sri Lanka in a much firmer footing than they were at one stage at the end of the first day of the first Test against Bangladesh played at the Galle International Stadium yesterday.
It was Mendis brilliant knock of 176 that paved the way for Sri Lankas 3-0 sweep of Australia in their last home series in July 2015, and it has taken him another seven months to notch up his second hundred at the highest level.
The way he is going he is certain to end up with another big score which could be the decisive factor in determining which way the series would go. Mendis was unbeaten on 166 at stumps having batted for 362 minutes and hit 18 fours and two sixes in his 242-ball innings with Niroshan Dickwella on 14.
At 149 Mendis passed 1000 Test runs  the 31st Sri Lankan player to do so and with Gunaratne, he shared a new fourth wicket partnership of 196 off 261 balls against Bangladesh erasing the previous highest of 150 by Kumar Sangakkara and Aravinda de Silva at the P Sara Oval in 2002.
Mendis of whom everyone expects big things was all class as he settled down to play some glorious pulls, drives and sweeps, mainly on the leg side where he collected 99 of his 166 runs.
Gunaratne continued his golden run with the bat and was unfortunate to be dismissed for 85 when he dragged a wide ball that could have been left alone onto his stumps. He had seven fours in his 134-ball knock of 85.
Mendis and Gunaratne raised the batting tempo during their partnership after Sri Lanka had scored only 61 runs in the first session of play so that by the days end the total had exceeded 300.
The final session of play produced 166 runs as the Lankan batsmen made capital out of the tired Bangladesh bowlers on a very hot day that saw the support staff bring out a giant umbrella to provide shade to the players during the drinks breaks.
The two batsmen Sri Lanka were banking on to score heavily Dimuth Karunaratne and Dinesh Chandimal both failed. Karunaratne coming to this Test on the back of a double century scored against England Lions in the unofficial test at Dambulla made 30 before chopping the ball onto his stumps.
Chandimal having scored an unbeaten 190 against this bowling attack for Sri Lanka Presidents XI in the two-day warm-up match was strangely subdued scratching around 54 balls for five before dot balls brought about his downfall got the better of him and his expansive drive ended up in gullys hands.
Upul Tharanga never looked a Test opener with his poor technique and it was no surprise when he was beaten all ends up by a delivery from Subash Roy that ripped through his defence and shattered his stumps in the sixth over of the day.
Sri Lanka strengthened their bowling attack for this Test going in with five specialist bowlers that included three spinners for the expense of a batsman Dhananjaya de Silva. Bangladesh also opted for five specialist bowlers but included three seamers instead.

From a mere slave to a storyteller
With almost all his plays, Chamika Hathlahawatta has been trying to explore different theatrical genres and demonstrate these experiments to create a unique experience to the spectators and to introduce something new or forgotten back to the stage. King I Am The Slave is one such an attempt to resurrect the age-old tradition of storytelling in a modernistic approach to the national and world theatre. This play can be staged not only in a proscenium theatre but also in an open theatre.
Taking a minimalist approach, the players present three incidents in Sri Lankan history that have been taking place during different time spans using a set of inexpensive jars which are turned into a thorn, mountains, chairs, horse, riverbank and many more as the story reveals. Five storytellers narrate the stories and enact the characters that they encounter through the play with a mix of wordplay and action. They manage to refrain from absorbing themselves wholly into the roles so as to ensure that they do not get totally away from primarily role of the storyteller. Play concludes throwing the responsibility of selecting the best hero to the spectators.
King I Am The Slave is an experimental attempt of Chamika Hathlahawatte to resurrect the age-old tradition of storytelling to the national and world theatre. It consists of three stories.
The first story is a fairytale of a slave gaining power against the king. The second is the legendary story of King Dutugemunu reuniting the state against King Elara. The third story is about a wise child, Premathilaka, who subdues to commit murder due to the rejection in love. The fourth story changes in end. Each story takes a twist and the storytellers change the expected ending to reach different and unexpected endings.
Hathlahawatte is the director as well as the playwright of King I Am The Slave. He has earned a Bachelor of Arts (Drama and Theatre special), Masters and Diploma in PHD. He translated Hayina in 2004 as a participant in Bharath Ranga Mahotsav. His Hari Apooru Dawasak staged in 2008 won eight awards at the State Drama Festival. Dragon directed in 2013 won eight awards at the National Drama Festival. King I Am The Slave produced in 2016 has won 10 awards.

The stage play will be staged at the Lionel Wendt on April 1 at 7 pm.

Motion against Wayamba Governor withdrawn at 11th hour
An urgent proposal similar to a no-confidence motion on the Wayamba Governor Amara Piyaseeli Ratnayake billed to be moved in the Wayamba Provincial Council at its meeting yesterday (March 7) was withdrawn at the last minute by Wayamba Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake, saying that it would be moved on a later date.
Giving reasons for the last minute withdrawal of the proposal before the council, the Chief Minister said he was acting on the orders of President Maithripala Sirisena who spoke to him over the phone from Indonesia in the morning and directed him to withdraw the proposal.
The Chief Minister told the Council Chairman that he would take steps to place the Presidents request before the governing UPFA group.
The Wayamba Provincial Council met at the Council hall yesterday morning presided by chairman Tikiri Adhikari.
From the inception of the meeting, there were whispers among the governing UPFA group about debating the proposal.
After the message was received from the President, there was suspicion among the group about the withdrawal of the proposal from the days agenda. After the 11 am tea break following the adjournment of the meeting, the governing UPFA group met and deliberated for nearly one and a half hours about the withdrawal of the proposal.
The Chief Minister informed the Council that the Proposal was not intended to remove the governor from her position or through an enmity towards her but solely to discuss the actions taken by the Governor which undermined the confidence of the council.
After the council meeting, opposition leader of the Council Shamal Senarath speaking to the media said this amounted to a defeat of the governing UPFA group. He said the Governing UPFA group has forwarded this proposal with the sole intention of inconveniencing the Chief Minister and putting him in trouble.

Nature boy radical edition : Montage on Life -2

Are all photographs we see today purely results of objects, camera lenses and the men behind those cameras Can all present-day photographers pride themselves on human figures or sceneries they capture and say those are not digitally mastered or manipulated before making them visible to the public eye
Mahinda Vithanachchi
Answer to this question is somewhat tricky. Some present-day photographers as we know rely on technology to carve a niche among their peers and also to speed up their production processes to derive optimum benefits from this lucrative profession. A world bent on marketing is playing havoc on many spheres let alone photography.
Mahinda Vithanachchi is a veteran photographer of a rare caliber who has weathered storms to stand tall as an artiste who rely on his instincts, philosophy and his camera. The camera to him is like a gun to a skilled gunman.
Mahinda Vithanachchis seventh photography exhibition branded as Montage on Life 11 was held recently at the JDE Perera art gallery with the participation of Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Champika Ranawaka, University Grant Commission Chairman Prof Mohan de Silva, Lake House Chairman Kavan Ratnayake and a gamut of art lovers.
Vithanachchi has done it the hard way starting from the grass root level. He has been a lover of humanity from his childhood.
Learning martial arts had helped him to build personality.
Vithanachchi came to Colombo from his hometown in Baddegama after his mothers demise at young age seeking love and recognition. His father who worked in the Colombo Dockyard Ltd at the time gave him protection whilst offering him a temporary job in the Dockyard.
On a trip to NEliya with his buddies Vithanachchi bought a Kodak 110 camera with some reels and went on a photographic spree. His friends astonished by Vithanachchis prowess showed their willingness to buy vivid images captured by him.
I never knew I had a knack towards taking pictures. Buying the camera came as an instinct. The feedback I got from my immediate friends and colleagues at the Dockyard motivated me to pursue a career in that direction, says Vithanachchi.
Meeting the veteran media person Vijitha Yapa at Upali Newspapers had been a milestone in Vithanachchis career as a photographer.
Vithanachci says, My friend Ranjit Gunewardene who was at the Ports Authority took me to Mr Vijitha Yapa, a media person bigger than life. Mr Yapa did a brief interview and told I need to further my knowledge on the subject. I came out not dejected but with more vigour to learn photography scientifically.
Veteran photographer and poet Lal Hegoda had made Vithanachchi a photographer who knows his onions. Vithanachchi has a great gratitude towards the former as a true mentor and a gentleman.
With the new-found knowledge and fresh confidence Vithanachchi held his very first exhibition in 1989 that was titled as First Collection. However this was the time he was in agony once again, due denial of love by his girlfriend this time around. Hence his mentality naturally cast a shadow on his maiden exhibition.
Vithanachchi turned out to be a sturdy organizer and a task master let alone being a photographer by working in a challenging environment and holding exhibitions.
Change of temperament
Following a string of exhibitions Vithanachchi realized he is matured to take his skills to a different level.
Subsequent to seeing humans in the local context acting inhumanly he got tired of capturing human faces with his camera.
People are helpless. They are on a rat race and the surroundings do not permit them to be empathetic. We have within us an animal and a Saint. We suppress the Saint most of the time and give in to animal instincts for mere survival in this pitiless society, he says.
Mother Nature breathes life to the human world. It offers CHI power to people who whole heartedly embrace it. These divine aspects of nature made Vithanachchi to evolve as a nature lover and a wildlife photographer.
Coffee table Book
To coincide with his latest exhibition Vithanachchi unveiled his coffee table book, Montage on Life ii which he considers pinnacle of his career. It is a compilation of super photographs he has taken on wildlife and Mother Nature.
This book has a fine up market finish and is rich with a combination of pictures of wildlife and nature captured by Vithanachchi. These pictures are printed in seven-colour using hp Indigo printing system for the first time in Sri Lanka.
Vithanachchi takes countless risks roaming in thick jungles and climbing mountains to do justice to his works. He would spend sleepless nights like a sniper to capture the very moments he has in his mind. A person who has travelled with him would endorse this statement.
Vithanachchis intends to expose Montage on Life 11 to the international sphere. The compilation is a collectors item and is best for wildlife enthusiasts and people who adore Mother Nature. It could be used as a tool for tourist attraction thus can be kept at star class hotels.
Interested parties, individuals and organizations could contact Mahinda Vithanachhchi on 0712 299375 or email [emailprotected] to obtain more information on Montage on Life 11.

Three Nepalese men have been remanded in custody over a northern suburbs murder in the UK that allegedly left a Sri Lankan victim face down in a pool of his own blood.
In the Elizabeth Magistrates Court on Monday, prosecutors successfully applied to have the identities of all three alleged murderers suppressed to safeguard the ongoing police investigation. The identity of the victim has also been suppressedbecause Major Crime detectives have yet to locate his family in Sri Lanka and inform them of his death.
Police have alleged that a man, 39, was killed at Penfield Gardens, north of Adelaide, on Friday night. They have further alleged the mans housemate had to flee for his life through barbed-wire fences from a group of up to six assailants. Eye witnesses claim the distraught and wailing housemate was found bleeding, and on the verge of collapse, at the front of the property.

Online Dynamic Economic Diplomacy Course launched
The Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Department of Commerce yesterday launched an online dynamic economic diplomacy course with Harvard Universitys Centre for International Development (HUCID).
The course is aimed at building the capacity of government officials to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).
The official signing of the agreement took place at the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
The 18 week-long course will serve between 35 and 40 government officials working in 15 to 20 missions abroad and in Colombo.
Participants in the course will be able to play a more proactive role to improve the volume of FDI and the diversity of Sri Lankas exports.
Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said Sri Lanka is behind neighbouring countries towards economic development, and that it is necessary to bring in Harvards help to catch up.
We have good runners in the race, but we need some strategic thinking.
How do we get ahead So we have come to the best in the world to coach our runners.
We believe that with their help and our dedication, we will be able to win this race, he said. Prof. Matt Andrews of HUCID said many countries are ahead of Sri Lanka in attracting foreign investment, but building the capacity of the countrys foreign officers is a good way to catch up.
Sri Lanka needs to improve the capabilities of its foreign officers, because they are the ones who are connected to companies outside the country.
These companies are also going to be the source of inward investment, he said.
We really are excited to see people learning and growing. But a key part of the course is actually getting people to try out new strategies to connect with businesses and bring business back to Sri Lanka, he said.

Over 1,700 micro-enterprises for North and East
Plans are afoot to establish 1,785 micro-enterprises in the Northern and Eastern Provinces under the Enterprise Based Village Development Project, said National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy. This was initiated by President Maithripala Sirisena in his capacity as the National Integration and Reconciliation Minister, with the concurrence of the Cabinet of Ministers on February 28.
The objective of establishing micro-enterprises in the Northern and Eastern Provinces is to improve the socio-economic standards of the conflict-affected communities, and to address poverty and regional disparities in the lagging areas.
It is proposed to establish micro-enterprises in 113 villages in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, and the project will be supported by a concessionary micro-finance funding through the Regional Development Bank and SANASA. The total estimated cost is Rs. 446 million. Each Micro enterprise will receive a maximum assistance of Rs. 250,000.
National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary Mr.V.Sivagnanasothy said that 25% of the estimated cost of each micro-enterprise initiative will be supported through a matching grant whereas 75% will be under loan, and that the interest will also be backed by the Government funds.
The Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) chaired by former President Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga will give leadership to implement these projects.
The projects will contribute towards the alleviation of poverty, and serve as a healing and reparation program to empower families affected by war.

Pan Asia Bank raises Rs. 2 bn in rights issue
Pan Asia Banking Corporation announced successful completion of its rights issue to raise up to Rs.2.06 billion.
The Bank in December 2016 announced to issue 147.5 million shares at one new share for every two shares held at an issue price of Rs.14 to fund its future growth while maintaining a strong capital base.The Banks share issue carried further significance given the fact that this was the first rights issue in the Colombo Stock Exchange for 2017 which would certainly have led to enhanced investor sentiments about the capital market in Sri Lanka.
Banks Acting Chief Executive Officer, Lalith Jayakody attributed the success to the strong investor confidence placed on the banks current and future strategies by its shareholders.
When we announced this rights issue we had the full confidence in our shareholders that they would be behind us. They knew that we have chosen a growth path which is both steadfast and sustainable. So, I believe this was the reason behind our successfully raising over two billion rupees and close the issue on a high note, Jayakody said.
Pan Asia Bank is the fastest growing commercial bank in Sri Lanka with its assets growing by over 20 percent to be slightly below Rs.130 billion as of end of 2016.The bank also increased its profit after tax by 20 percent to Rs.1.25 billion.

Shooting at SAITM CEO
Police pursue ex-Kaduwela PS member and driver
Police are investigating to arrest UPFA former Kaduwela Pradeshiya Sabha member Lakmal Vilathgamuwa and driver Susil Udayakumara attached to Kotikawatte Pradeshiya Sabha over the shooting incident of SAITM CEO Dr. Sameera Senaratne, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said.
The minister was responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake under Standing Order 23 (2) in Parliament yesterday.
However, the minister said there are no eye witnesses to the incident. He could not confirm the media reports that the shooting was staged until the Police investigations conclude, he said.
He said a person known as Thilan who previously confessed to have carried out the shooting later confessed that he did so as he was promised Rs. 500,000 if he took over the responsibility of the incident.
The minister said the Police investigations over the incident were being carried out expeditiously.

CB officials refraining from providing documents to COPE
Speaker to look into issue
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said in Parliament yesterday that he would look into the incident of Central Bank officials deliberately refraining from procuring certain documents to the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE).
The Speaker made this observation in response to a point of order raised by Joint Opposition member MP Mahindananda Alutgamage.
MP Alutgamage said some Central Bank Officials in the Presidential Commission on the Bond Issue had accepted that they refrained from procuring several documents on the issue before the COPE. But the control on the public finance is vested in Parliament.
The Speaker should look into the matter without delay since this is a bad precedent. Public officials would refrain from providing documents to the COPE, Alutgamage said.
We should find out on whose instruction officials refrained from procuring documents to the COPE, he said.
The Speaker said he would look into the matter.
Ravis or MRs signature not on Gazette on Treasury Bonds
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake or former Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has not placed their signatures for the controversial Gazette dated January 1, 2015 on the issuance of Treasury bonds, Parliament was told yesterday.
Minister Karunanayake, moving two Orders under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act for debate, said the Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 1895/19 was not referred to the Finance Ministry in contrary to the standard practice. It had been signed by the Public Debt Superintendent and sent to the Government Printer, he said.
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake questioned the credibility of Government Gazettes published under the names of Ministers when they claim they did not sign them.
The Finance Minister also challenged former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to go before court challenging the gazette dated January 1, 2015, stating that the truth would come out when the case is taken up.
We followed the tradition set by Rajapaksa, Ajith Nivard Cabraal and P. B. Jayasundara since 2005 when issuing this Gazette. They are the pioneers of this tradition. Former President Rajapaksa had placed his signature to a similar gazette in December 31, 2012, but from 2013 to 2015, the Central Bank had Gazetted them without the signature of the Finance Minister, he said.
Minister Karunanayake said out of the Rs. 7.8 trillion bonds issued from 2005- January 8, 2015, 80.8 percent were issued on private placement.
These were shared among three or four individuals. About 68 percent of these private placements went to three institutions, as 33 percent to Commercial Bank, 17 percent to Hatton National Bank and 18 percent to Seylan Bank, he said. The minister said it was due to these frauds, the Prime Minister insisted on public auction instead of private placement.
He said strict laws are needed to manage non-banking financial institutions in the country as they have faced a risky situation due to the previous governments mismanagement of the sector.
The former government has permitted to start 54 such institutions whereas the country needed 15-20 such institutions, he said.
Bill on Enforced

A person guilty of the offence could be imprisoned for a term not exceeding 20 years, and also be liable to pay a fine not exceeding Rs. 1million and compensation not less than Rs. 500,000 to a victim.
As of the Act: A superior who knows, or consciously disregards information which clearly indicated, that subordinates under him were committing or about to commit an above mentioned act or fails to take reasonable measures to prevent or repress it or submit the matter to a law enforcement authority for investigation and prosecution is also guilty of the offence of enforced disappearance.
The Bill will be taken up for the second reading at a future date.

JO quizzes on alleged false press release
by Finance Ministry
The Joint Opposition yesterday questioned on the alleged false press release issued by the Finance Ministry on the gazette notification with regard to bond issue on January 15, 2015 which the Secretary was not aware of.
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardene making a statement under standing order 23(2) said the Secretary to the Finance Ministry has told the Presidential Commission investigating into the bond issue that he was not aware of the press release though it has been issued with his seal.
According to a newspaper report, the Finance Ministry Secretary has told the presidential commission that he was not aware of the press release and that many releases were issued to the media without his knowledge, MP Gunawardena said.
This is a serious issue. The Ministry Secretary accepted that the press release had been issued by Finance Ministers Media Secretary Sisira Wijesinghe, he said.
This is a release by the Finance Ministers Media Secretary to make malicious allegations against the former President and the then Central Bank Governor, MP Gunawardena said.
The Finance Minister has misled the nation. He should be removed from the post, he said.
Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would make a statentment today on the issue.
He said it is not acceptable that a senior MP like Gunawardene talk of the investigations carried out by the Presidential commission in Parliament as the investigation is in progress. This is not fair by MP Gunawardena as he is in Parliament since 1983, Minister Kiriella said.
However, a tense situation erupted when several members wanted to express their views and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that he could not allow to make the point a matter of debate. He said nobody can order him to give the mike.

PickMe cab services  an asset to users
PickMe, one of Sri Lankas first mobile taxi hailing Company says that an efficient cab service can prove to be a great asset in terms of cost as well as time management for users.
In a scenario where vehicle prices keep skyrocketing and congestion on roads is getting to be out of control; it would appear far more advantageous to some to replace ownership with a reliable taxi service.
CEO of PickMe, Zulfer Jiffry says that is what their service offers customers a way of rethinking their investment in transportation, without the added cost of large interest payments to leasing/borrowing institutions or the hassle of driving around on congested roads, trying to find almost non existent parking spaces during rush hours. He says that according to their calculations, the minimum investment in any kind of vehicle as opposed to using their taxi service is extremely high.
Zulfer believes that most of these costs could be avoided and traveling made much simpler both in terms of expenditure and time, by hailing a cab for daily commutes to work or for other daily chores such as school drops and pick-ups.
In both cases the monthly leasing of an equivalent vehicle itself would cost 2-3 times more than what they would spend on taxis; and add to that the fuel and maintenance costs they would have to incur. Therefore, the assumption that taking a taxi for your daily travels is a luxury ordinary middle class people cannot afford is in fact not entirely true.
During a press conference held at HNB recently, PickMes Chairman Ajit Gunewardene said, I believe that one PickMe vehicle on the road allows to remove four other vehicles from it. The efficiency levels will go up to such a point that it will have a significant impact on traffic, pollution and on fuel consumption.
Zulfer added that the world is now moving away from vehicle ownership especially as a mode of daily traveling. Look at Singapore, they have remedied their traffic problem, lack of parking and severe pollution through online taxi hailing apps and ride sharing.
These apps allow them to connect with people around the country and share a ride with whomever they choose. Use of these services has not only become cost effective for the consumer but has helped to considerably reduce the number of cars travelling on their roads and as a result, also improved their environment he said.
The global trend in investment that supports a similar vision is called a sharing economy where people consider sharing homes and vehicles as a better option than owning one. Even businessmen and women around the world have taken to re-directing their investment in assets that pay back instead of in assets that only serve one purpose while depreciating in value otherwise.
The CEO says that there are local companies who now provide employees holding higher positions with taxi services like PickMe to drive them around as they have begun to see the advantages of time management and keeping their Executives hassle free.

Pope says consult Bible as often as your mobile phone
VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis on Sunday called on people to carry and read the Bible with as much dedication as they do their mobile phones.
Speaking to pilgrims in a rain-soaked St. Peter's Square, the 80-year-old pope asked: "What would happen if we treated the Bible like we do our mobile phones"
He continued: "If we turned around to retrieve it when we forgot it If we carried it with us always, even a small pocket version If we read God's messages in the Bible like we read messages on the mobile phone"
Francis called the comparison "paradoxical" and said it was meant to be a source of reflection, adding that Bible reading would help people resist daily temptations.
The Pope poses regularly for "selfies" with pilgrims who flock to his weekly audiences wielding smartphones, while his English and Spanish-language Twitter handles have more than 23 million followers.
Francis last year called the internet, social media and text messages "a gift of God" if used wisely.
"It is not technology which determines whether or not communication is authentic, but rather the human heart and our capacity to use wisely the means at our disposal," he said.
But in 2015 Francis told a young girl he was embarrassed to admit that he did not know how to use computers and was an overall "disaster" with technology. He has also said smartphones should be banned from the family dinner table and children should not have computers in their rooms.
The Pope spoke during his last public appearance this week. He and top members of the Roman Curia, or its central bureaucracy, begin their annual week-long Lenten spiritual retreat in the village of Ariccia on Sunday. - SYDNEY MORNING HERALD

President proposes stable legal order
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday urged members of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) to adopt a comprehensive framework to prevent the trafficking of illicit drugs by sea.
The President, in his address to the IORA Leaders Summit yesterday said it was necessary to examine the dangers at sea such as piracy and terrorism.
The President said the trafficking of illicit drugs by sea has become an industry of sorts.
Although various steps have been implemented to counter trafficking, there is no satisfactory end result, the President said.
It is universally recognized that all littoral States possess a maritime area bordering their coasts within which they exercise complete authority. However, beyond this limit are high seas which are not subject to the jurisdiction of any State. Illicit drugs are often smuggled into the country from the sea beyond the territorial waters, President Sirisena added.
I suggest IORA to work out a stable legal order to confront these concerns in conformity with the principles of the freedom of navigation.
The President said it was in this context that the IORA
Concord and the Action Plan were signed by member nations, strengthening the organizations role as an active forum for dialogue.
He said the national unity government had undertaken measures with regard to Sri Lankas position in the Indian Ocean region. The President informed Sri Lankas ambitious plans to enter the global value chain by becoming a regional hub for trade, tourism, transport and logistics.
The President stressed that it was necessary for IORA to initiate a dialogue between SAARC and ASEAN leaders.
As our current Chair, Indonesia is also a member of the ASEAN and it may be useful to consider initiating a dialogue linking IORA member States, its dialogue partners and all interested major and middle powers. The President welcomed Indonesias commitment to bring together all member nations of the IORA and its dialogue partners.

Prime Ministers Message For International Womens Day
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in a message released for International Womens Day that falls on March 8, said he hoped Sri Lankan women would find the strength to successfully overcome challenges and emerge as a confident stakeholder of Sri Lanka's common future.

Although in Sri Lanka, women are significantly empowered in many ways than their counterparts in the rest of South Asia, their role in domestic and household work has resulted in limitations being imposed on their contribution to the economy.
While being conscious of her role as a wife and a mother, it goes without saying that the woman of today has the capacity and the potential to play a greater role economically, socially and spiritually.
As a nation, we must be able to set the stage for her to be accepted, acknowledged and recognised within a wider context; one in which we can truly assure her of an equal position and the rightful place in our society.
It is the obligation of the society and the government to ensure that women in Sri Lanka are able to aspire to the kind of empowerment women all over the world have experienced in modern times.
My hope is that the theme of this year's International Women's Day will encourage and facilitate the Sri Lankan woman, towards truly fulfilling the role required of her within a greater economic and a social framework at a national level.
This International Women's Day, may every Sri Lankan woman find the strength within her to successfully overcome challenges and emerge as a confident stake holder of Sri Lanka's common future.

Rathana Thera wants harassing of intelligence officers stopped
Parliamentarian Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera urged the relevant authorities not to harass intelligence officers of the three forces by taking them into custody on various unjustifiable allegations.
Ven. Rathana Thera addressing media yesterday in Colombo representing the The National Council of Sri Lanka said several intelligence officers who had rendered a yeoman service to the country during the LTTE terror period, are taken into custody especially by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and by other investigating bodies without any acceptable or justifiable reason.
These intelligence officers have been arrested and remanded on various charges, which are not acceptable. Certain officers have been taken into custody by the CID based on a statement given by someone. The officer is in remand after being produced before courts under section 296 of the Penal Code, the Thera said.
Rathana Thera added that the President or Prime Minister is not fully aware of this situation. He said all these incidents may have occurred as an outcome of international mediation. I think the tri forces commanders are notified when intelligence officers are to be taken into custody. There should be a separate investigation by the security forces into the charges. If there is any basis for the allegations, further measures can be taken, the Thera said.
However, he said the National Council of Sri Lanka never objected to conducting investigations against intelligence officers on acceptable and justifiable grounds. But, the issue is that intelligence officers are being harassed on fabricated charges, he pointed out.
When asked by media who is behind this issue and what international mediation is involved, the Thera said that the National Council of Sri Lanka is ready to reveal all details soon once it is confirmed.

Retd. Maj. Gen. Kamal Gunaratna trying to be manipulative of the facts of war: Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka
Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday said retired Major General Kamal Gunaratna is trying to plot a path to politics by being manipulative of the facts of war.He said, he is yearning to become the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army with the support of the Rajapaksa family. I must warn him that the Rajapksas are going to knock him down and he is never going to get it.
Field Martial Fonseka was speaking at a press conference at Government Information Department in Narahenpita yesterday.
Fonseka said, Major General Kamal Gunaratna who commanded a regiment under my command during a certain period of the war, had said that he played a malor role during the war and it was because of that leadership that the war was ended with success.
But, he had not specified what kind of leadership role he played, he stressed.
Legally and customarily, the true leadership descends from ones senior officers in the Army. No army officer can take orders from outsiders or any political authorities other than from his senior officer in command, he explained.
This officer had said he had got a leadership and it was due to his leadership that the war was concluded successfully. This is the sort of thing that an Army officer can never say because every officer in the Army takes orders from their senior officers, Fonseka said. He said, An army officer cannot take orders that come through the backdoor of some Secretary or persons engaged in politics.
Gunaratna owes an explanation, he said, He had spoken about sacrifices made by military personnel. He had said that 5,900 Army personnel had sacrificed their lives in the war, but that number is 5,300. A total of 500 Navy,Police and Air Force personnel had sacrificed their lives,Field Marshal Fonseka said.
He had said that 2,900 soldiers had sustained injures, but over 23,000 soldiers were injured during last phase of the battlethe Field Marshal said.
He( Gunaratna ) does not know the number of soldiers who got injured and taken from the field of battle. Gunaratna had said around 6,000 terrorists were taken into custody and another 6,000 were hiding among the people.
This is also untrue because the number of terrorists taken into custody was 12,000.
It appears that this officer has clean forgotten what had happened in the field. 
I still can remember every bit of it as if it happened yesterday. I think ones dedication helps one to remember things of importance, he said.
He had said he is an experienced officer. I do admit that. He was at the Sillathurai camp. He was surrounded by terrorists. He was there for a week with 100 soldiers.
I had the chance of sending backup troops to rescue him. I was servicing with the Singha Regiment at the time, Field Marshal Fonseka said.
Also, terrorists surrounded his camp in Mankulam. He was with 300 soldiers. He made an escape through a fence and returned with 150 soldiers. He is experienced. But, the experiences he had were mostly unpleasant.
He says that Army intelligence is the most valued asset in the force. He was an infantryman. According to what we have learnt the greatest asset in an armed force is infantry. It is personnel of the infantry regiments that had sacrificed the most number of lives in the battlefield- around 5,000 lives in total.
As pointed out by Field Martial Fonseka seven or eight persons of the Army Intelligent Unit, had died in the line of duty during last phase of the war. Field Marshal Fonseka alleged that Major General Gunaratna is full of air about Intelligence Units apparently for some political pursuit. But, he is not speaking on behalf of Sri Lanka Army. I must make mention here that those who talk a lot about Intelligence Units did not know whether such a thing existed in this country, when I took over the Army then.
The first thing I did after assumeing duties as the Army Commander was removing four of the intelligence officers who were there. I appointed four officers of the Infantry regiments and other regiments to the posts. We restructured the system of Army intelligence and its functions, Field Marshal Fonseka added.

The rise of women
Today, women all over the world celebrate the International Womens Day (IWD), a time to reflect on progress made, to call for change and to celebrate acts of courage and determination by ordinary women who have played an extraordinary role in the history of their countries and communities. IWD has been formally celebrated by the UN and countries around the world since March 8, 1975, which was the International Year of Women, although its roots can be traced to 1908, when 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding voting rights, better pay and shorter working hours. March 8 is an official holiday in more than 25 countries.
The Charter of the United Nations, signed in 1945, was the first international agreement to affirm the principle of equality between women and men. Since then, the UN has helped create a historic legacy of internationally-agreed strategies, standards, programmes and goals to advance the status of women worldwide. The UN defines IWD as a day when women are recognized for their achievements without regard to divisions, whether national, ethnic, linguistic, cultural, economic or political.
This years theme of IWD is Women in the Changing World of Work: Planet 50-50 by 2030. The idea of this theme is to consider how to accelerate the 2030 building momentum for the effective implementation of the new Sustainable Development Goals, especially goal number 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls and number 4: Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning. The theme will also focus on new commitments under UN Step it Up Initiative and other commitments on gender equality, womens empowerment and womens human rights.
Key targets of the 2030 Agenda include: By 2030, ensure that all girls (and boys) complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and Goal-4 effective learning outcomes; By 2030, ensure that all girls have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education; End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere; Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation; Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation.
The world of work is changing, and with significant implications for women. A large number of women are working in all sectors, but in both developed and developing countries women get lower salaries or wages compared to their male counterparts. There are only a few Government or commercial entities that have truly achieved a 50:50 male to female ratio in terms of employee numbers. The reference to Planet 50:50 is a nod to that ambition which has to be achieved by 2030, now less than 15 years away. But it wont be easy  the World Economic Forum predicts that the gender pay gap will not close until 2186.
Apart from the pay gap, there is increased focus on gender equality and the empowerment of women. Sri Lanka is one of the few developing countries with impressive statistics on girls and women, with virtually zero discrimination on the education of girls. Indices such as maternal mortality are almost on par with those of the developed world. Sri Lanka also has the distinction of producing the worlds first woman Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, whose daughter Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was also elected Executive President.
Yet, the number of women in local politics in Sri Lanka is extremely low even by South Asian standards. The prevailing electoral system has been partly been blamed for this situation and we hope the new Constitution will grant a better place for women in politics. Sexual and physical violence against girls and women is a major issue in Sri Lanka  in fact, a recent nationwide study commissioned by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) revealed that 90 percent of women and girls in Sri Lanka have been subjected to sexual harassment on public buses and trains with only four percent seeking help from the Police. UNFPA in partnership with the Ministry of Womens and Child Affairs, Ministry of Transport Civil Aviation, the Prime Ministers Office, and the Sri Lanka Police, launched a public advocacy campaign titled Does she travel safe.
Equal attention should be paid to domestic violence, both physical and sexual. It is a known fact that perpetrators of such violence are almost always known to the victim  either a relative or guardian, not a total stranger. This is a black mark on our society and culture and steps should be taken to purge such violence from our midst.
There is a long way to go before we can say that women have been truly empowered all over the world, yet progress is being made on many fronts. Women have shattered the glass ceiling in many sectors and have equalled or even exceeded the achievements of their male counterparts. This IWD is likely to be a catalyst for further progress on these lines.

The SAITM conundrum
The subject of private medical education seems to have gained centre stage and both print and electronic media are laden with very hot news. The whole country has become the hotbed of politics over the subject and many a writer expressed his or her ideas very frankly on the subject.
I took my own time and spent my hard earned money to keep abreast of time and thus I was able to educate some of my friends over the matter during the last few days. Yet, lo and behold, an article written on the subject took my mind away from the main point and I was lost in it, there was nothing in it on the subject, but a long harangue on the language policy of a bygone era. I was not able to find any relevance to the subject, but I sensed some hatred towards some leaders who reined the administration.
That is history.
Now the die is cast.
What we have to focus is the validity of the SAITM degree and its quality and standard, as responsible citizens. Most of the vociferous speakers and writers had touched on the subject with sensibility, but not with sense. Both the writers and the readers should put the relevant subject on the hammer from different angles. It is our bounden duty to educate the public based on the acceptable truth, not on the fabricated stories.
Degree factories
For my own purposes, I cross-examined some members of the general public and found out that majority is against private medical education without the required theoretical and clinical training. Lets keep apart the theories, but clinical aspect is of paramount importance. Some of the members in favour of SAITM were those who have sent their children there. Some were the relations of the would-be victims. Some others were the parents who wish to send their children there one day, but rational minded right thinking members of the society are dead against it. Money can do many worldly things, but making a doctor with money is illogical. Then a very very moneyed parent could make all his offspring the disciples of Hippocrates, proverbially overnight. I personally know the parents of some of the learned professors there brought them up with great difficulty. If there had been SAITMS by that time they couldnt have become professors. We have to speak to the very hearts core in these matters of national importance.
The new breed of medical men generated from these degree factories would widen the social disparity paving for another bloodbath on our soil. So, our deliberations on these matters should essentially be far reaching. The tone of the writers speaks volumes for their inner disposition. On the other hand, if the parents could spend over hundred and twenty lakhs of rupees on one child, why cant they do something else for the future of their children After all doctors are born, not made. Let the natural course decide their future. I dont wish to mention here, but I did it and I conquered. Medicine is a sacred profession and the government has to safeguard its precision.
The writer had displayed a table for us to study the spread of private medical universities in the region.
I was very happy to learn that there was not a single one in our country. He has cited a huge number in India. It is something important. In this paper itself, very recently it reported in the foreign news page that a private medical university manager had issued 100 MBBS degrees for just 100 dollars each.
Private medical universities in India
Another authentic experience with me is that when I was teaching in an island in the Maldives, there was an Indian doctor on the same island. His standard and quality was quite palpable to me. There is a wide spread notion that most of the private medical universities in India offer substandard medical degrees.
The number of doctors in India has posed a national crisis there and should we also here face the same tragedy here by letting our rules loose. Narrow-mindedness should not ruin the country.
Everyone from the grassroots level to the upper echelons seem to have embroiled in the labyrinth of this conundrum, yet utmost care should be taken in giving a solution because all the decision making body has to go before the poor masses for their survival. State medical education and private medical education are two different things.
Never the twain shall meet.

A school cricket encounter with rich traditions
The rich traditions of the worlds second oldest inter-school cricket encounter will continue for the 138th occasion when Royal takes on S.Thomas in their Battle of the Blues three-day cricket encounter which begins at SSC grounds on Thursday.
Even two world wars could not stop the Royal-Thomian encounter which had begun way back in 1879. Since then, the two leading cricket-playing schools have met each other every year - uninterrupted.
From its centenary encounter in 1979, the Battle of the Blues big match was upgraded to a three-day affair  another first in local school cricket.
Since then, the last 37 matches in the series have been three-day games, except in 1985.
The inaugural match between Colombo Academy (as Royal College was then called) and S. Thomas College, Mutwal (which later moved to Mt. Lavinia) had both students as well as teachers in their respective teams. Ashley Walker captained Colombo Academy while a staff member Rev. S.J. Meyrick led the Thomian team. However, this match is not considered in the Battle of the Blues series as both schools had several staff members in their teams.
But from the following year, only students represented the respective teams. Royal (then Colombo Academy) had the honour of winning the 1880 encounter by 62 runs at Galle Face grounds, which hosts Galle Face Hotel at present.
In its proud and rich cricket history, the Reid Avenue School has produced some top cricketers who had played for Sri Lanka with distinction. Heading that galaxy of world class players is former Royal, NCC and Sri Lanka captain Ranjan Madugalle, now the Chief ICC Match Referee.
Madugalle led Royal in the 100th Battle of the Blues encounter and in the same year, he was adjudged the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year.
The longest unbeaten run by the Reid Avenue boys in the Battle of the Blues series was from 1965 to 1987. During the 23-year period without a single big match defeat, Royal emerged victorious on two occasions (1969 and 1983) while the rest of the 21 games were drawn. Royal registered back-to-back victories in 1990 and 1991 under Udaya Lakmal Wijesena and RohanIrriyagolla respectively.
Sumithra Warnakulasuriyas marathon knock of 197 in the 1980 big match continues to be the highest individual innings in the series. Besides Warnakulasuriya, the only other Royalist to score a big match century on debut was Jagath Pattiarachchi, who cracked an unbeaten 100 in 1974. Nigel Fernando is the youngest ever Royal captain in the series. He was only six days short of his 17th birthday when he led the Reid Avenue school in 1989.
Royal's Rochana Jayawardene produced the best all-round effort in the series with a blistering knock of 145 not out and a match bag of 9 for 97 (5 for 29 and 4 for 44) in 1983. Prior to that, Barney Gunasekera of Royal too, had an impressive match analysis a top score of 148 and 7 for 57 in 1930.
The Thomians are better known for their fighting qualities which have been evident in the series. Having lost the 2006 encounter, the Thomians came back fighting the following year (2007) under Ashan Peiris to beat the Royalists by an innings. Since then, there have been five consecutive drawn encounters.
The Thomian grit was once again evident when they escaped from the jaws of defeat as Royal came close of winning the 2009 match. But the Thomian second-wicket pair of Fahim Saleem (165) and the captain Ravichandra Niroshan (100) defied the Royal bowling for 10 hours and 44 minutes, adding 232 for the second wicket which virtually sealed the chances of a Royal win.
S.Thomas has an equally rich cricket history, producing several top Sri Lanka cricketers in the past. Heading that list of Thomian cricketing legends is former Sri Lanka captain and ex-chairman of selectors, Duleep Mendis. He represented S. Thomas from 1970 and 1972 scoring back to back centuries in 1971 and 1972, captaining his alma mater in the final year. He still accounts for the highest individual innings for S.Thomas (184).
His nephew B.C. M.S. Mendis represented College from 1991 to 1994 scoring two centuries and one half century. He too captained the side in 1994.
Duleep Mendis's son R.S Mendis (2003-2005) was the vice captain of the victorious 2005 team and also scored a half century.
M.O. Gunaratnes superb all-round effort, scoring 107 and capturing 7 for 34 in 1935 is considered the best double by a Thomian. L.H.Arndt had an outstanding bowling figures of 6 for 26 and 8 for 28 in 1905 match for the Mount Lavinia school.
The Royal-Thomian is much more than a mere inter-school cricket match or just another big match. It has been the annual meeting place for thousands of old boys of the two schools and their supporters, maintaining high traditions of the two of the oldest cricket playing schools in the country.
Even the Heads of State, including the late President J.R. Jayewardene, and many Ministers and parliamentarians, made it a habit of taking time off their busy schedules to catch the excitement which is unique for the Royal-Thomian.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too has been a notable spectator at the series and was the proud chief guest when Royal beat S. Thomas by four wickets at last years encounter.

## Title: Sexual harassment at epidemic levels in UK universities

Sexual harassment at epidemic levels in UK universities
Sexual harassment, misconduct and gender violence by university staff are at epidemic levels in the UK, a Guardian investigation suggests.
Freedom of information (FoI) requests sent to 120 universities found that students made at least 169 such allegations against academic and non-academic staff from 2011-12 to 2016-17. At least another 127 allegations about staff were made by colleagues.
But scores of alleged victims have told the Guardian they were dissuaded from making official complaints, and either withdrew their allegations or settled for an informal resolution. Many others said they never reported their harassment, fearful of the impact on their education or careers. This suggests that the true scale of the problem is far greater than the FoI figures reveal.
These numbers are shocking, but sadly, from our experience, are just the tip of the iceberg, said Dr Ann Olivarius, senior partner at the law firm McAllister Olivarius. Sexual harassment of students by staff members has reached epidemic levels in British universities. Most universities have no effective mechanism to stop staff from pressuring students into sexual relationships, and when it happens, any sort of disciplinary action is pretty much nonexistent. Those in charge are often colleagues who have many incentives not to intervene.
Young women are often terrified about the consequences if they make a complaint about a staff member. So often, when they do, the universitys chief concern is to downplay any wrongdoing and protect its own reputation by keeping the whole thing quiet.
Anna Bull, co-founder of the 1752 Group, set up to address staff-student sexual harassment in higher education, said: There is evidence to suggest that the actual figures in the UK will be staggering. The Association of American Universities undertook a detailed survey of sexual assault and sexual misconduct in 2015 (student-student and staff-student). Surveys were completed on 27 campuses, with 150,072 students responding. The survey found reporting rates for sexual harassment  staff and student  [were] 7.7%, and only 28% of even the most serious incidents are reported to an organisation or agency.
Legal experts and campaigners
Oxford University reported the highest number of allegations against staff by students, with 11 received by its central administration and 10 by colleges  though it said there may have been duplication between college and central administration figures. It was followed by Nottingham with 10, Edinburgh with nine, University of the Arts London (UAL) and Essex with seven and Cambridge with at least six.
Oxford also had the most staff-on-staff allegations, with 17 recorded centrally and three by colleges  though again, there may be duplication. Next was Cambridge with at least seven, Portsmouth with six, and Exeter, York and LSE with five each. Nottingham and Goldsmiths said they had fewer than 10.
Only five universities said they had compensated students. Goldsmiths, University of London, which has been criticised for using non-disclosure agreements in settlements, paid out the most  192,146  followed by UAL, which gave about 64,000 to two students, plus an undisclosed sum to a staff member over an allegation of sexual harassment by a colleague.
Legal experts and campaigners have cautioned that universities reporting a high number of allegations and investigations are not necessarily those with the worst problems. Indeed, higher figures might reflect that procedures there are more effective.
A junior female member of staff at a university in southern England told the Guardian she had tried to raise concerns about sexual harassment in her department for five years, but no manager she contacted had taken action. The worst thing is that there are many people who are suffering under this professor. Simply putting in a formal complaint will not do anything but make life hell for me and other women. He will never be fired. Everyone I have spoken to confirms this.
A graduate student who was sexually assaulted by a senior academic told the Guardian that her university in southern England had pressured her to drop her complaint. She said: They offered me a settlement on the condition that I drop out of the programme and accept that no internal investigation on the member of staff would take place.
Sexually harassed students
When I refused, they were forced to conduct an independent investigation; however, the investigation didnt feel independent at all. In the end, none of my complaints were upheld, despite all the evidence of the member of staffs behaviour towards me. The investigator concluded that the senior member of staff and I were friends, and that he had simply tried to help me.
The member of staff still has his post in the institution, he is still teaching and supervising students, whereas I am not even attending the campus, and I am completing my studies remotely. Her complaint is now being investigated by the Office of the Independent Adjudicator, which assesses whether universities have correctly followed their procedures.
A senior lecturer at a university in the north of England told the Guardian she had raised an allegation of sexual harassment against a co-worker as an informal complaint but was told it would have to be treated as a formal grievance. The university went ahead with its own investigation and said it had found evidence of a relationship between the complainant and the accused, so it could not be sexual harassment.
She denies there was any relationship. She was asked to withdraw her complaint in order to keep her position.

Shashi Welgama fulfils bail conditions
Former Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) Chairman Shashi Welgama, a nephew of former Transport Minister Kumara Welgama was yesterday ordered to be released on bail by Colombo Additional Magistrate J. Trotsky as he fulfilled bail conditions imposed by the Colombo High Court.
On Monday the Colombo High Court ordered the release Shashi Welgama on a cash bail of Rs.200,000 with two sureties of Rs.5 million pursuant to a revision application filed by Welgama challenging the Magistrates Court order to refuse bail.
The suspect was further barred from leaving the country. Shashi Welgama was arrested for allegedly cheating and misappropriating Rs.125 million of public funds when purchasing a stock of leaf springs to the SLTB between 2010 and 2012.
On December 20, 2016, Shashi Welgama was arrested by CID along with Nandana Priyantha Perera the owner of Nandana Auto Products Co. Ltd regarding an investigation into a financial fraud said to have taken place when purchasing leaf springs to the SLTB.
The CID had informed Court that the SLTB on two occasions had paid advance payments amounting to Rs.40 million and Rs.166 million respectively to the suspect Nandana Priyantha Perera in order to provide leaf springs to the SLTB. The CID further alleged that the suspect had supplied the leaf springs to SLTB with a deficiency, which amounted Rs.24 million and Rs.101 million respectively.
The CID had further alleged that the former SLTB Chairman had given his authorisation for the concerned financial transactions acting in his capacity as the then Chairman of SLTB. The CID further informed Court that original documents pertaining to this fraudulent transaction had been destroyed by the previous administration and a complaint regarding this incident had been made by present SLTB Chairman Ramal Siriwardena. The suspects are charged under the offences under Public Property Act.
At a previous occasion, the Colombo Additional Magistrate had issued an order directing the Controller of the Emigration and Immigration to prevent four individuals including the former SLTB Chairman, Nandana Priyantha, Sanjeewa Waidyatilleke and Sumith Hettiarachchi from leaving the country.

Social enterprises, social finance concepts,   gathering momentum in Sri Lanka
Lanka Social Ventures, a social enterprise committed to promote and support entrepreneurship and innovation for social development and environmental sustainability says social enterprises and social finance, though a fairly new concepts, are slowly gathering momentum in Sri Lanka.
This was revealed at a recent conference held in Colombo, organized by Lanka Social Ventures in partnership with Oxfam, National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA), British Council, Good Market and VEGA BIZ+, Lanka Impact Investors Network (LIIN) and Social Enterprise Lanka.
Social enterprises are defined as revenue-generating businesses with a twist. Whether operated by a non-profit organization or by a for-profit company, a social enterprise has two goals: to achieve social, cultural, community economic and or environmental outcomes; and, to earn revenue.
Meanwhile, Central Bank Assistant Governor Asoka Handagama said that Sri Lanka needs to identify social enterprises within a legal framework as there is no clear definition for social enterprises in the country's business registration.
"Social enterprises are there, but they are registered as normal business entities. There should be a separate segment to get these enterprises registered; subsequently the regulator will be able to device a mechanism to fund them not on a donation basis but on an investment basis to promote the sector," he said.
The country should also benefit from social finance as it is an approach to managing money which delivers a social dividend and an economic return, he noted.
He further added that Sri Lanka needs to create awareness on social enterprises and social financing, and reflect on their potential to contribute to sustainable development and poverty reduction.

SriLankan to be paid for by lessor            to redo cabin configurations
SriLankan Airlines has sent the following clarification to the article published on March 6, bearing the heading SriLankan wastes on lease aircraft seats.
The clarification said: Some portions of this piece refer to the cabin refurbishment program entered into, in the 2010/11 financial year.
At that time, the airline embarked on an initiative to reconfigure a number of aircraft with lie-flat business class seats and a new inflight entertainment (IFE) system for selected wide-body A330 long haul aircraft. This was an ambitious and extensive project which resulted in a new look and feelto the aircraft, with an enhanced product that the airline uses to this day.
Due to the large number of seats and related equipment required and space constraints in the engineering area at the airport, an off airport warehouse in the Seeduwa area was rented for the duration of the project.
Once the refurbishment was successfully completed, the premises were cleared of all the equipment and returned to the owner in November 2016.
The above is totally unrelated to the issue of the A320 aircraft bearing registration 4R-ABK, which is currently in the process of being returned to the owner/lessor.
The next operator of this aircraft needed the cabin reconfigured to their standards.
SriLankan Engineering was contracted to do so, with the necessary seats and equipment being provided and paid for, by the lessor. The work is ongoing and SriLankan Engineering will be paid for this work.
There never was any connection between these two refurbishment projects, which are separated by many years. One was for aircraft that are being operated by SriLankan and the other for an aircraft that is to be flown by another airline in a different country.That your article attempts to link the two events is, at best, poor reporting and is a blatant distortion of the facts.
SriLankan Engineering has a long standing and profitable contract with Indigo Airlines of India to provide heavy maintenance services for their aircraft. These activities are conducted by a dedicated team in a separate hangar at Katunayake.
There is no merit to the allegation that preferential treatment is afforded to Indigo. The line that performs this work functions as a separate business entity within Engineering. SriLankan Engineering is proud of its long association with its valued customer Indigo and is proud to say that the contract has been renewed for a further three years, SriLankan Airlines said in a statement yesterday.

Taiwan through Lankan lenses
Crossing Bridges program was founded by two photographers of Singapore and Indonesia in 2004 and then Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Korea Taiwan and China became members of the group subsequently. Our own eminent art photographer Bandu Gunaratne was adjudged the Country Leader for Sri Lanka at the program in 2012 in Malaysia. Each year the host country organises a tailor-made tour for photographers. Since 2004 this event has taken place in Macau, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Korea and in 2015 Sri Lanka was the host country.
End of last year Crossing Bridges was held in Taiwan R.O.C. The objective of the C.B. program is to bridge friendships and understanding between member countries of South and South East Asia. By bringing the region's photographers together once every year facilitates exchange of knowledge, share experience and to explore new technologies relating to the field of Photography nevertheless it eventually gives a boost to the host country's tourism promotion. This is because the tour will be usually planned to explore more places where the normal tourist doesn't visit.
Thereafter the photographs having special points of view will be spread among millions of people in the region. A total number of 95 photographers participated in this year's program which was targeted to capture the spirit of Taiwan R.O.C. A seven member delegation led by Bandu Gunaratne represented Sri Lanka as "Viewfinders-SriLanka" in this year's event.
The CB 13 was organised and led by Fu Shan Jaw a professor of the National Taiwan University. Taiwan is a country where Japanese and Chinese traditions and cultures are combined with. Colourful architecture of Taiwan was some of the highlights of the photography programme. Besides this, human activities of the country also were exposed to the participating photographers. Yehilu Geopark was a special location in the C.B. 13 tour map.
This site comprised of huge corals standing out of the ground created a weird landscape by the sea. The photo tour workshop comprised of mountain side of the country, beautiful lakes, pagodas, Chinese traditional temples and also Dutch and British constructions with historic interest.
Taichung was a great city the delegates could visit and were allowed to visit and photograph the ultra modern architecture of National Taichung Theater. The 'Roundhouse' a museum of railways was another place of interest having a display of out-of-track locomotives in it's usual parking environment. Mayor of Taichung city Chia-Lung Lin was the chief guest at the closing ceremony and he emphasised the importance of having a gathering of photographers in the region in his speech.
The participants had the opportunity to enjoy Taiwanese hospitality together with tasting Taiwan cuisine such as Fish ball soup & iron egg, Gua bao, Green onion pancake, Ba wan, Biandang and Sun cakes. The hotel facilities provided for the delegates were commendable. There were daily photo competitions for the delegates in which the best photograph of the day was adjudged and prizes were awarded.
It was unanimously decided at the Country Leader's meeting that the next Crossing Bridges event will be held in China, late this year. Since there was no diplomatic representation of Taiwan R.O.C. in Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan delegates faced unexpected difficulties of obtaining Taiwanese visa.

Thilanga bowls a doosra at Arjuna
There is little room for doubt that Thilanga Sumathipala, the president of Sri Lanka Cricket and Arjuna Ranatunga, Sri Lankas World Cup winning captain are sworn enemies. The way both individuals have attacked each other in public is well documented.
So it came as a bit of a surprise when Sumathipala extended a hand of friendship and invited Ranatunga to join him and offer his services to uplift Sri Lanka cricket. It is an invitation in the eyes of the public which Ranatunga cannot refuse lest he will be looked up as a past cricketer who is turning his back on the country.
On the contrary the big question is whether Ranatunga will want to tarnish his good name by tagging onto Sumathipala whom he has accused of being a gambler, swindler, manipulator etc and one who should not be holding office as the head of Sri Lanka Cricket. He had even gone to the extent of urging the government in power to dissolve the present SLC body and appoint an interim committee under him.
We have brought cricket in Sri Lanka to a position which we can be proud of. If we are to save the most popular and widespread sport in the country, we must relieve it from bookies, said Ranatunga. The best strategy available to us to put an end to the current mess in cricket is to dissolve the Cricket Board and appoint an Interim Committee. I am ready to take the leadership of this endevour, for the sake of national cricket of our country.
I have no objection towards Arjuna coming to help, said Sumathipala during a media conference held last Sunday to introduce Sri Lanka Crickets latest signing of 1996 World Cup winning team member Asanka Gurusinha into the Sri Lanka teams ever growing coaching staff.
We have about eight out of the 14 member 1996 World Cup winning team working with us. Aravinda (de Silva), Sanath (Jayasuriya), Romesh
(Kaluwitharana), Hashan (Tillakaratne), (Chaminda) Vaas, Upul Chandana and now Gurusinha, said Sumathipala.
All of them are highly talented. Kumar Dharmasena is an international umpire; Roshan Mahanama was a renowned ICC Match Referee. Even before them players like Ranjith Fernando and Hemantha Devapriya too did great service, he said.
During my previous tenure as SLC president Aravinda and Arjuna both played for the national team. I was the vice president when we won the World Cup.
Arjuna has an enormous amount of knowledge and experience. He can do a great service again. I have no objection in inviting him to render his services towards building up the team. There is no restriction for that.
Lots of cricketers honour him and there is no question about his experience, Sumathipala stated.
That is saying quite a mouthful and an offer which no one can resist turning down. Will Ranatunga fall for the bait
To roll back the years it is Ranatunga and Aravinda de Silva who in their prime years as cricketers were instrumental in bringing Sumathipala into the Sri Lanka Cricket administration stream in the nineties. They wanted someone to represent the players and fight their battle at the SLC and Sumathipala became a popular figure with them. But over time a lot has changed while De Silva has stuck with Sumathipala, Ranatunga has fallen out with him and even lost a contest for the SLC presidency as well as failing to win a position as an SLC vice-president at the last election.
The appointment of Gurusinha who was domiciled in Australia since the World Cup triumph came as a surprise to many. His role as Sri Lanka cricket manager explained by Sumathipala is that he will mainly work as a coordinator between the national team, selection committee and Sri Lanka Cricket. He will also act as the national team manager on all foreign tours..
Sumathipala said that the existing team manager Ranjith Fernando would continue his role alongside Gurusinha and that the duties of the team manager and head of selection committee Sanath Jayasuriya will come under Gurusinha. Sumathipala stressed that the team manager and SLC manager are two different duties with Ranjith Fernando looking after the administrative affairs during tours.
By making Gurusinha national team manager for all foreign tours and his role as coordinator between national team, selection team and SLC shuts the door on national selectors going on tours with the national teams in future. It is a complete slap on the face for Jayasuriya and Co.
It was only recently that Jayasuriya was involved in a situation where there were reports that he had threatened to resign after indifference with the SLC hierarchy over a selector not being sent on the tour to South Africa amongst other issues. Jayasuriya finally had his way and travelled to South Africa for the T20Is and ODIs. As things are turning out to be it is Sumathipala calling the shots, for how long only time tell.

Thomians looking to avenge last years defeat
After an initial spell of uncertainity the Thomians are firmly believing in themselves and are in a positive frame of mind that they can avenge last years defeat at the hands of Royal College this time around at the 138th Battle of the Blues encounter which begins on March 9 and goes on for three days at the SSC grounds Maitland Place.
According to Thomian coach Dinesh Kumarasinghe, the present outfit is the youngest Thomian team playing in a Royal-Thomian match since 1983 with just three coloursmen sans much fanfare.
The team has reached good heights by winning five of their 18 matches and remained unbeaten.
They have recorded outright wins against Dharmapala, Dharmasoka Ambalangoda, Anuradhapura Central, St. Sylvesters and Trinity College, Kandy.
The last win against Trinity College after 29 years has really boosted the confidence of the side and has made them feel second to none.
Although there are only two centurions in the side namely Dinura Gunawardene and Ishen Perera, skipper Romesh Nallaperuma (over 650 runs), opener Ravindu Kodituwakku (over 800runs) and Mithila Perera (over 650 runs), Sithara Hapuhinna and Delon Peiris have proved that they are consistent scorers.
However, the Thomians forte has been their bowling. Their spin attack comprising the left- arm leg-spin of Pavith Ratnayake who has already taken 95 wickets for the season with a best analysis (7 for 47) against Dharmapala Pannipitiya and looking forward to complete the century mark of wickets during the three day contest.
Supported by Delon Peiris with the capable Kalana Perera, Dinura Gunawardene and Ravindu Kodituwakku in addition to his batting could also chip in as an useful bowler. The Thomians are fortunate enough to get the expertise of Sri Lankas World Cup winning coach Dav Whatmore as a consultant coach. Whatmore along with Dinesh Kumarasinghe, the head coach has given the team more confidence.
Kumarasinghe is aware of the capabilities of the experienced Royalists and prefers to be und erdogs. At the same time he is supremely confident and knows the strength of his side and along with Whatmore would have drawn a strategic plan how to combat the opponents.
Duleep Mendis struck 184 in 1972 and it stands as the highest individual score for the Thomians in the contest.
Royals Sumithra Warnakulasuriyas194 in 1980 is the highest individual score by any player in the series. The Thomians last won in 2007 under Ashen Peiris when the Royal captain was Haroon Mowjood.

In tragedy, he finds theatre
Namel Weeramuni is second fiddle to none.He is in the company of the legends of theatre. Outstanding Personalities features this grand dictator of Sri Lankan theater. And he never compromises or toes the line when it comes to his productions.
Q: Why did you choose to do theatre Why did you enter the field of theatre
A: I am professionally a lawyer. From my youth the intention was to do law. But theatre was my hobby. And this hobby has now turned into my profession. I have a passion for it and that is why I am involved in theatre.
I did my Masters in Law in England. I practised in London for over 30 years in the field of law. And then I was in the Legal Draftsmans Department as an assistant legal draftsman. I developed an interest in writing as well. I went to the States to do my doctorate in theatre but I did not complete it. I did a Masters in theatre (University of California Northridge) and recorded a GPA of 94.6 and then went to Hawaii to do my PhD. in theatre. There, after about two years I got really bored. I thought it was not worth me doing a PhD. Then, I had only to do the thesis. I did the course work, and only had to do the thesis. I then came back to London and again entered law. And then I came to Sri Lanka and built my abode called the Punchi Theatre. Throughout my life in England and in the States and in Hawaii, I did plays while studying and practising. Even now I can do a thesis but have become disinterested in it. There are 18 campuses in the University of California and one is Northridge where I got my Masters in which there are 48,000 students.
Even as a schoolboy, I took an interest in theatre. I used to perform at school concerts. I too excelled in writing. I wrote short stories and criticisms of plays. I wrote poetry. In short, Arts gave me the greatest satisfaction. I was a voracious reader during my youth. Still I do continue this habit. Until I die I will be a student. That is what I believe about life.
Q: What element or quality in theatre appeals to you
A: It is the tragedy of life which it portrays that draws me. I like serious theatre. Comedies are always good. But in tragedies you can discover a certain humanity. To me, that is what is most important. I am not trying to demean Greek comedies. They are legendary. But when we watch a tragedy, there is so much for us to contemplate when we come out of the theatre. Today, unfortunately there is nothing serious happening in theatre in Sri Lanka. This is what I feel. When you come out of a theatre you have to think about what you saw and ponder on the message, but there is nothing of that where these modern day plays in Sri Lanka are concerned. When you think of serious theatre, you think about Professor Sarachchandra, Gunasena Galappatty, Henry Jayasena and Sugathapala de Silva. We still survive on these plays. Tragedy gives you so much sensitivity to think about. The messages of the great films that I saw still roam in my mind. That is what inspires me. This element of tragedy kindles my passion. However I do not want to come across as someone who is critical of comedies. There is something appealing there as well. However in history, comedies too are great, such as the Lysistrata of Aristophanes. That was translated and done by Dharmapriya Dias which was a very good production. The play is a humorous account of how one woman sought to end the Peloponnesian War by persuading the women of Greece to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers, thereby forcing them to negotiate a peace. It causes a battle between the sexes and provides a study of sexual relations in a male dominated society.
Tragedy allows me to think about humanity. We can empathize and sympathize with characters. We get involved in the story. Let us take Anton Chekhov, the plays are all like comedies but at the same time they are also tragedies. Through comedy you portray tragedies. The play that I did Nattukkari is a tragi-comedy. We start with a lot of comedy and end up as a tragedy. Nattukkari was a play by Jean Anouilh, a French Playwright.
Q: You are a director, dramatist, actor and playwright. Do you like tackling controversial subjects Do you like challenging convention Do you like tackling controversial subjects
A: Of course I do. One play I did, which was an original, is the Sword of a Journalist. Most people say Nattukkari was my best play, but as a production I really consider Sword of a Journalist as the best play I have done so far. It has not been seen by many because it deals with cruelty. I based that particular play on the JVP incidents in 1989. The background of the play is that there is a politician who wants to control the press. And the particular female journalist is someone who goes in search of truth. But she writes a story against a minister. The minister gets angry and uses the underworld gang to stop the stories. This journalist is unafraid and wants the truth to be divulged. As a result her father is killed by the underworld gang. The mother of the journalist is also attacked. The play is full of suspense and intrigue. It is a controversial play. I was also told by some well- meaning friends that even I might face problems. They said I might also become a victim.
I did another play called Fourth Floor. That too is a very controversial and political play. It is based on a real life character as well. I am a man who likes doing controversial plays. Again people suggested that I might be in danger. But I personally felt I was in no danger.
I also adapted one of Henrik Ibsens plays. Next to Shakespeare he is considered the best playwright in the whole world. I adapted his play  An Enemy of the people to suit the Sri Lankan society. It was in Sinhala. It was a great success but unfortunately people did not come because it was serious. That is the whole problem.
The problem is that Sri Lankan people want to see only comedies because they want to laugh! But most of these are not plays or dramas, they are like stand up comedies. There is not much of a plot as such. The language is used in order to get laughs. It is done according to the mood of the audience. That is the whole problem.
My play Nattukkari (1969 - 1970) is a translation of Jean Anouilhs Colombe. It was called theatre at its best. The public loved it. Within two years we had done more than 250 shows. It was also done in England with a different cast. In England I have done around six plays in Sinhala and English, and Nattukkari was one of those plays.
I have published 10 or 11 plays and a collection of short stories and two collections of poetry. I was a critique for Dinamina for seven years. One of my professors wrote of me: Namel Weeramuni is one person who has harvested all his talents in the University.
The feedback I received from my plays have been good and critics have called them remarkable plays. However there was one good play I did as an adaptation that was banned in 1972 which was called Isnt there anybody to save us from the chains
One common theme in my plays which I try to explore is the truth. And I have never compromised on that. I translated Jean Paul Sartres play Nekrassov into Sinhala. I adapted that into my Sinhalese play. The censor board had a problem with it. They said it was against the government at that time. It is again about a journalist who tries to get the truth out. That was banned ultimately. I was not able to show it up to date. They wanted me to change the whole thing and I said that I was not prepared to do that. I did not want to take away the essence of the play.
Q: What do you expect from your actors and actresses
A: What I want from actors and actresses is to portray the characters in accordance with the script. They must create in their own minds the character they are performing. You have to be truthful and genuine in what you perform. You got to interpret that. Sometimes I give a lot of freedom to the actors and actresses. But after some time I became a total dictator. I insisted on particular things being done my way. I wanted the delivery of the lines to be done my way. I get what I want out of them. To be a dictator is the best thing. Peter Brook is the worlds famous Dictator. He gets out of the actors exactly what he wants. He is considered a fine director, who directed the play Midsummer Nights Dream. It was a totally different interpretation. It was a superb play. It was a totally different production. It was unimaginable. Peter Brook is considered one of the best producers in the whole world. It was so thought provoking. So that is also what I look for. The audience has to be enlivened. I have been able to do that in my plays. That is why all my plays have been successful. I have produced good actors and actresses. That is the important thing. And that makes me a very happy man today.

Tyre - Inspired
Tyres are a highly versatile open ended resource that can be used by schools and settings for children of all ages and stages. They take hundreds of years to break down if sent to a landfill site, so opportunities to re-use them make a positive difference.
Children love the feeling of enclosure and will frequently stack tyres up for this purpose.
Painting tyres is popular. It is simple, effective and easy to do  the idea came from the children who wanted a place to sit in their rainbow garden. Using the markings on tyres can also lead to some lovely designs.

Vaiko, Thirumavalavan ask Centre not to back SL
Indias MDMK general secretary Vaiko and VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan on Monday appealed to the Centre not to support Sri Lanka during the ongoing United Nations Human Rights Council meeting, since the island government had not implemented the councils resolution in 2015 to set up a hybrid mechanism to probe the war crimes during the military offensive against the LTTE in 2009.
Vaiko, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution in 2015, paving the way for an independent impartial investigation by international jurists into the alleged war crimes committed by the Sri Lankan army in 2009. But, Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had declared that the island nation would not permit any jurist from any country into Lanka for the investigation into the happenings of 2009.
High Commissioner for United Nations Human Rights Council Zeid Raad Al Hussein made a statement criticising the slow progress in addressing alleged wartime crimes. He requested the Union government to take necessary steps to change the Indian Governments position in the HRC in favor of an independent international investigation.

Why successful authors are giving their books away for free Simone Collins
Hugh Howey, John Dumas and Danny Iny all have one thing in common. The bestselling author, top-ranking podcaster and profitable entrepreneur have a habit of giving their books away for free.
They are not alone. More authors than ever are offering free ebooks to their readers, either on a periodic basis through Amazons KDP Select program or as perpetually-free downloads through Amazon and/or personal websites. Those who do not give their books away for free are more often than not opting for very low prices, seeking to sell at high volumes rather than high margins.
Why do some authors offer free books First, because they can. This option, which would have not been practical two decades ago, has become feasible thanks to self publishing and the rise of digital books. Self-published authors typically earn higher royalties, plus incur no costs when an ebook is sold.
Second, authors generosity is often reciprocated by a myriad of benefits. In addition to enjoying more readers (and thus more word-of-mouth marketing), authors who give their books away for free or at low costs frequently enjoy deeper customer relationships, more reviews, more sales of print books and increased sales of related books, products and services.
When I asked Hugh Howey about his pricing heuristics, he revealed he has no idea what hes doing when it comes to price and freebies, but focuses on giving readers the best experience possible. I err toward the side of cheap, he wrote. I want readers more than I want profits. The latter follows the former.
His prolific publishing and widely-available books helped to spawn a very large following online  one that grew to be so attractive to publishers that Hugh was able to sign a neigh-unprecedented publishing deal with Simon & Schuster in which he retained full rights to ebook sales. Most authors understand that free books can boost readership, but widespread readership does more than build a flattering fan base. Publishers look for traction when considering authors; a robust online audience is one of the most important things an author must have if he or she seeks to sign a favorable deal with a mainstream publishing house.
Hugh Howey is not the only author whose generosity boosted interest; John Dumas shared with me that, thanks in part to free giveaways (and generally keeping its price very low), his book became one of Amazons top-selling podcasting guides. John attributes much of this success to the number of good reviews his book has received (specifically, over 140 five star reviews on Amazon), many of which were probably given by those who received the book for free.
As good rankings (which are highly influenced by reviews) can make or break a book on Amazon, authors stand to gain a great deal by finding legitimate means by which they can foster favorable feedback from readers.
Many authors who hesitate to offer free books maintain the assumption that free books lead to a net loss in sales. Those who have experimented with the option often find the opposite to be the case: many times, free ebooks actually boost sales of print copies. Danny Iny, who has written several books on marketing, shared with me that many who download his ebooks ultimately choose to buy his print books  presumably because they enjoy what they have read of a free ebook so far and would prefer to have a print copy.
Danny has also seen a correlation between book readership and the sale of various products and services he offers. Those who read his work apparently find his products and services all the more attractive, which has lead Danny to view book publication as a very effective marketing strategy.
Danny also likes using book giveaways to foster deeper, long-lasting relationships with followers, readers and customers. By asking for email addresses in exchange for free ebook downloads, Danny is able to maintain an ongoing dialogue with his readers. Through emails and newsletters, Danny is able to frame himself as a real, engaging and memorable human in the eyes of his readers.
A friendly ongoing relationship with readers (bolstered with free and easy-to-access content) yields far more for authors then the antagonistic mistrust of online audiences to which some writers still cling. It is entirely understandable why authors get nervous about ebooks and freebies. Seeing people exchange pirated copies of a lovingly-crafted book hurts. But piracy is inevitable. Whether authors make their books available for free or not, unauthorized copies will be made and exchanged.
Instead of attempting to fight piracy, authors must claim ownership of the process. Readers opt for the path of least resistance. If they can access an authors books for free (or at a low cost) legitimately, they will choose that legitimate path over less-convenient illegal alternatives.
Authors who offer their books at a price point amenable to online audiences gain the ability to develop loyal followings and reap peripheral rewards- be they word-of-mouth marketing, favorable reviews, or yes, even more print book sales.
Online audiences are entirely willing to pay for content. Content creators simply must prove themselves first. Those who are willing to be generous themselves will be met by generosity in return. - Huffington Post

## Title: Why such a hurry

Why such a hurry
Ive come to realize, more and more, that Im always rushing.
I rush from one task to the next, rush through eating my food, impatient for meditation to be over, rushing through reading something, rushing to get somewhere, anxious to get a task or project finished.
Whats the deal This coming from a guy who has written a lot about slowing down and savoring, about being present, about single-tasking
As always, when I write these articles, theyre as much a reminder to myself about what Ive found to work as they are a reminder to all of you. Ive found them to work, but that doesnt mean I always remember to practice them. It doesnt mean Im perfect, by any means.
So what is going on Why do I hurry so much
Ive been reflecting on this, and the answer seems to be that my mind has a tendency towards greed. This isnt greed in the sense that I want a lot of wealth  but my mind finds something it likes and it wants more. Always more.
Some examples of greed: I like chocolate (or wine, or coffee, or cookies) and I crave it, and want more even if I just had a bite of it.I am doing a task but also want to do 20 more tasks, because I want to do as much as possible. Wanting to do more and more, to do everything, is a good example of the minds tendency to greed.When I learn, I want to learn everything about a topic. Ill look up every book I can find, every blog post or article, every podcast or video, every forum post, and want to read all of it. Of course, I cant possibly read all of it now, but I want to. Ill buy 10 books but jump around from one to the next, not finishing any of them.When I travel to a new city, I want to see it all  all the best sights, all the best vegan restaurants, all the best bookstores and museums and experiences. I cant possibly, but Ill do my best to fit all the best stuff into the small container of my trip, and research it for weeks.When Im going about my day, I try to fit as much as possible into it: not only all my tasks, but spending time with the wife, reading with the kids, working out and meditating and doing yoga and going for a walk and reading and learning online and answering all my emails, watching all the best TV shows and films, and checking all the forums and news and blogs and more and more.
I rush around, trying to fit all of that in. Im trying to maximize every day, every trip, every event, every moment. Im trying to get everything possible out of life.
This comes from a good heart  I appreciate the briefness of life, and I appreciate its brilliance, and I want all of it in the short time I have left here. Thats not a bad thing, wanting more of life.
But what is the result of always wanting more, always wanting to maximize Its rushing, grabbing onto everything, never having enough, never being satisfied, never actually stopping to enjoy, not really appreciating each moment because Im greedy for more great moments.
Indulging in this greediness for more, this maximizing everything, doesnt satisfy it. It just creates more wanting for more.
Indulging isnt helpful. Staying with the feeling of wanting more, wanting to maximize, wanting to rush, wanting to do it all  thats more helpful. Stay with the feeling, Leo, dont indulge it.
Dont try to do it all, but instead be here now.
Dont rush, but appreciate the moments in between things as just as important as the next thing.
Dont try to maximize, but instead practice letting go. Let go of greedy tendencies, let go of whatever youre clinging to (having it all, doing it all), let go of the urge to rush.
Whenever theres a tendency towards greed, counter it with generosity. - Zen Habits

Womens contribution to the nation invaluable: Opposition Leader
Opposition Leader of Parliament R. Sampanthan sending a message to mark the International Women's Day stated the contribution of women to the nation has been invaluable.
However, unfortunately, women continue to face routine discrimination, harassment, and maltreatment in every corner of our society, he said.
The Opposition Leader stated that women were also the most affected as a result of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka. "For instance, the war snatched away the lives of their loved ones, leaving many widowed and without livelihoods. Still more, thousands of women continue, to date, to search for their family members who disappeared during and after the war. This matter requires urgent attention and action as it continues to make these women vulnerable to abuse and exploitation and impairs them from moving on with their lives, the Opposition Leader said.
"As we celebrate the role of women and remember their contribution to our nation, my hope is that we would also, as a people, resolve to ensure gender equality and equity, and safeguard the dignity of all women in Sri Lanka. As such, my hope is that the new constitution would reflect these aspirations, ensuring greater protection and empowerment of all women in all spheres of society," Sampanthan said.
"As we enter a landmark period in the history of our country, I also wish to affirm the importance and call upon the government to ensure the full participation of women in reconciliation and transitional justice processes. Finally, while recognizing the extraordinary efforts of women towards the prosperity and progress of our nation, I call upon all women to continue to strive hard towards the development of our country," stated the Opposition Leader in his message.

Women empowered in many ways than their counterparts : Prime Minister
Women are significantly empowered in many ways than their counterparts in the rest of South Asia, but their role in domestic and household work has resulted in limitations being imposed on their contribution to the economy, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stated in a message to mark the International Women's Day.
"While being conscious of her role as a wife and a mother, it goes without saying that the woman of today has the capacity and the potential to play a greater role economically, socially and spiritually.
As a nation, we must be able to set the stage for her to be accepted, acknowledged and recognised within a wider context; one in which we can truly assure her of an equal position and the rightful place in our society," the Prime Minister stated.
"It is the obligation of the society and the government to ensure that women in Sri Lanka are able to aspire to the kind of empowerment women all over the world have experienced in modern times.
"My hope is that the theme of this year's International Women's Day will encourage and facilitate the Sri Lankan woman, towards truly fulfilling the role required of her within a greater economic and a social framework at a national level.
"This International Women's Day, may every Sri Lankan woman find the strength within her to successfully overcome challenges and emerge as a confident stakeholder of Sri Lanka's common future," the Prime Minister stated.

Youths damage police station in protest
Two officers of the Bingiriya police station were injured and the police station was damaged to the value of nearly Rs. 200,000 when a group of youths behaved violently opposite the police station protesting against the action taken by police over a vehicle accident that killed a youth on March 6.
A youth died in a collision of a motorcycle and a van at Prasannagama on the Weerapokune-Bowatta road in Bingiriya on March 5. The van and its driver were taken into custody by the Bingiriya Police and the driver was produced before the Hettipola Magistrate and released on bail the following day.
The youths in the area protested and behaved violently opposite the police station alleging that police inaction led to the release of the van driver on bail who was under the influence of liquor at the time of the accident.
The protestors blocked the Chilaw-Kurunegala road for nearly four hours burning tyres and hurling stones at the police station.
Windows, the name board of the police station and a jeep were damaged during the violence.
The crowd was dispersed later after arresting a suspect and seizing 35 motorcycles, a lorry and two three wheelers used by the protestors to arrive at the station. Police said 35 suspects are to be arrested. Investigations are continuing.
