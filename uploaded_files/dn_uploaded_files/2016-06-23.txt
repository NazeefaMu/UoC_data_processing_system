Cabinet approval a must for release of elephants for processions - Wildlife Minister
Elephants to be used for the purpose of processions for temples and devalas will only be released on the approval of the Cabinet hereafter, said Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera.
He further said that elephants would be released by a Committee and not even the Wildlife Minister would be permitted to grant such requests.
He made these observations yesterday, in response to a question raised Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
The government also would take measures to maintain a pool of trained elephants for precessions, Minister Jayawickrama Perera said. Elephants that are in custody at present, would not be used for processions as such elephants had been taken after killing the mother elephants and such elephants were living under tension.
He also said that a procedure would be formulated to release elephants to processions and the elephants would be released only to temples and devalas approved by the President, Prime Minister and the Committee set up for the purpose. He added that discussions have been made with owners of elephants in this connection.
Wildlife Minister Jayawickrama Perera assured that there were enough elephants in the pool to provide for processions. He added that trained elephants would be provided to the Kataragama, Kandy, Aluthnuwara and Vishnu Devala processions that are to be held in the near future.

IMF and AGs reports on Govt borrowings contradictory - PM
The IMF report submitted recently on the Governments borrowings and the Auditor Generals report on the same included in the Finance Ministry Annual Report 2015, are contradictory, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation following a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake after Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake made a ministerial statement on the matter.
The Premier pointed out that a special team of the IMF who investigated on the Governments debts, handed over a report recently, adding that its findings match with those mentioned in the Treasury report. He observed as the Auditor Generals report on loans was contradicting with the IMF and Treasury reports, the Finance Committee of Parliament should submit a special report on this matter to the House after a probe.
We included Rs 1,300 billion unaccounted debts to our total debts recently. The Government was not told about this amount by the Auditor Generals Department until very recently. Now it claims that we had obtained Rs 1,500 billion more loans. Then it should point out from where we obtained this money. Going by the statistics of the Auditor General, this Government cannot be run in this manner. If the Auditor Generals Department changed the methodology of accounting debts, it should have informed Parliament. These contradictory reports are not good to the image of the country. I will also look into it, he said.
MP Anura Dissanayake pointed out that the Finance Minister should take responsibility of the AGs remarks in the Annual Report, as it was the Finance Ministry report and was tabled by the minister himself.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena commenting on Minister Karunanayakes comments on the AG, said the Minister had no right to criticize the AG without bringing in a substantive motion. However, replying to this argument, the Premier said the contents of the documents submitted by the AG could be commented on as public finance is under the control of Parliament. It is the conduct of the AG that we cannot be criticized without bringing in a substantive motion, he added.
Statement of AG would paint wrong picture of govt. - FM
The Auditor Generals report which stated that the government had obtained loans in 2015 exceeding the amounts approved by the Appropriation Bill for the year was a document with no scientific basis and an attempt to produce a wrong picture of the governments financial management, said Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation at a ministerial statement in response to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who said the Auditor General has noted in the Finance Ministry Annual Report tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, that the government had its exceeded loan limit for the Financial Year 2015.
He stated that the Appropriation Bill had been amended on two occasions and according to them, the limit of obtaining loans had not been confined to Rs 1,780 billion. He added that the government has taken loans accordingly.
He stated that a change in the system of accounting adopted by the Auditor General had led to confusion. He said the Auditor General had changed the system of computing the total borrowings.
The Auditor General has calculated it using a different method adopted by all the other previous Auditor Generals, Minister Karunanayake said. Most of those Auditor Generals have said the manner the incumbent Auditor General adopted is not the accepted manner that they used.
The Finance Minister said that the Auditor Generals statement would paint a wrong picture of the government and would result in declining of the countrys position in international credit ratings.
The statement of the Auditor General would also produce a wrong picture of the governments financial management, Minister Karunanayake said. The statement does not have a scientific base. Such actions would be detrimental to maintain a financial discipline. That would also discourage the officials of the Finance Ministry who work hard to maintain a financial discipline to control government finance.
Minister Karunanayake further stated that this government has asked from the Auditor General of the incident of taking Rs 3,100 million and giving it to the Irrigation Ministry on January 07 on the day before the Presidential election. How could it be done just 24 hours before the Presidential election questioned Finance Minister Karunanayake. We have directed this matter before the FCID. It was the budget of Mahinda Rajapaksa. It was such an economy we were handed over.
Finance Minister expressed his regret for the wrong statement made by the Auditor General and his hope to meet him in future to discuss the matter.
Law and order in Beruwala now better
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe while assuring to provide additional security to Joint Opposition Kalutara District MP Piyal Nishantha if necessary, reminded the House that the situation concerning law and order in Beruwala, had significantly improved unlike in the period of the former regime where Muslims in Aluthgama - Beruwala were attacked.
He made this observation following a privilege issue raised by MP Piyal Nishantha that he received death threats over the phone by an anonymous caller demanding Rs 2 million. The MP said his life and the lives of his family members were under threat as the Police had not so far not taken any action with regard to the Police complaint made in this regard.
The Deputy Chairman of Committees S Addaikalanathan who was in the Chairing at that time, said the matter would be referred to the Speaker and necessary action be taken. The Prime Minister observed that Parliament may request the IGP to take necessary steps in this regard.
The MP referred to the law and order situation in Beruwala. So let me remind him that the era where innocent Muslims were killed is now over, he said.
This comment was criticized by JO members, stating that the Premier had taken the incident lightly and joking on it. This issue led to a tense situation in Parliament as about 20 JO members stood up in protest and created an uproar.
Stern action against those soliciting money for school admissions - Education Minister
The Government would take stern action against those who solicit money to admit students to schools, warned Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
The minister said there was no mafia in the education sector as it had during the previous regime. He requested that the government be kept informed if there was still remnants of such errant officials, so that the government could take steps against them.
He made these observations yesterday in Parliament in response to a question raised by Opposition member Vidura Wickramanayake. The Education Minister stated that the mafia in the education sector could be ended by the good governance government.
Bill presented in House for establishment of office for missing persons
A Bill was presented in Parliament for the establishment of an office for missing persons.
The Bill was presented by Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella on behalf of the Prime Minister and National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister.
It is a Bill to provide for the establishment of an Office on Missing Persons to provide for the searching and tracing of missing persons. It is also to provide assistance to the relatives of missing persons, for the setting up of database of missing persons. It is also a Bill to provide for the setting out procedures and guidelines applicable to the powers and functions assigned to the said office. It also provides for all matters which are connected with or incidental to, the implementation of the provisions of this Act.
Rs 530 m loan provided to company without Cabinet approval - Eran
The Lankaputhra Development Bank (LDB) had provided a sum of Rs 530 million as loan to Tristar Apparel Exports (Pvt) Ltd., (TAE Pvt Ltd) on an approval by the Cabinet in 2007, said Public Enterprise Development Minister Eran Wickramaratne.
He also said the same company had paid only Rs 500,000 back so far which is questionable if a bank could provide such a large loan to a company even on Cabinet approval when the company is not capable of resettling the said loan.
He made these remarks in Parliament yesterday, in response to a question raised by UNP Parliamentarian S. M. Marikkar.
Minister Wickramaratne also said that the government had commenced to take legal action in this connection. It is taking steps to recover it under the Parate Execution Law.
Marikkar said that the Company had only settled Rs 100,000 an year and it would take more than 400 years to settle the loan.
With regard to the loan of Rs 700 million granted to a furniture manufacturing company, Minister Eran Wickramaratne said that it was not granted on approval of the Cabinet, but on a decision of the Board of Directors.
MP Marikkar said the loan had been granted to a company that had defaulted a some of Rs 20 million earlier.
He questioned as to what steps would be taken to take legal actions against the members of the Board of Directors. Minister Wickramaratne said that possibilities are sought to do so.
Govt to construct 350 houses for Sastraveli people
The government is constructing 350 houses for the people in Sastraveli in Panama whose houses were acquired during the previous regime in 2010, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs and Lands Minister John Amarathunga said.
He said the government is taking measures to give not only land but also houses for those who were deprived of them during the previous regime.
He made these observations yesterday in response to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake under sanding order 23(2).
He questioned as to why the government does not take measures to grant those lands that were acquired by the previous government according to the Cabinet decision taken on February 11, 2015. He added those 350 houses are constructed at some other location other than in their traditional lands.
Dissanayake said that 1,220 acres were acquired forcefully in 2010 and now they are under Navy and Air Force and added that Air Force constructions are taking place only on 25 acres.
He said in accordance with an order of a Court in Pottuvil the Divisional Secretary has ordered the people who went there again after this government came into power to leave the area before June 30.
The minister said that this decision had been taken by the previous government and added that those lands have a locational value and it could be an injustice to the other people in the country if those lands were given to them.
He added that this matter could be solved by way of discussions and MP Anura Dissanayake agreed.
Some without basic qualifications elected to Parliament
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday told Parliament that he was shocked at the quality of some the people who have been elected to the House.
Raising a privilege issue, Minister Karunanayake stated that some who do not even have the basic qualifications to be employed even at low level employment in any organization, have been elected to Parliament.
Raising the issue, he said during the debate on the No Confidence Motion against him on June 09, Joint Opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage had made false and incorrect unsubstantial statements against him.
Aluthgamage told in this august assembly willfully and deliberately with the intention of insulting and defaming me and damaging my reputation and dignity as an MP, the Finance Minister said. The MP in his speech referred to five reasons as to why this vote of no confidence was moved. They are according to him: (a) that I do not have the confidence of the government to hold this position, (b) The President and the Prime Minister do not have confidence in me, (c) that I have destroyed the economy of the country, (d) that I am accused in an exchange control fraud and (d) that I have used my position to influence my private business.
The Finance Minister further said that Aluthgamage made a host of other baseless allegations during the course of his speech.
He informed the House that he had documentary proof of all what he said. However, I must state that the first and second accusations were proved wrong on that day itself, as 145 MPs of the government and opposition together, voted to defeat the motion. Both the President and the Prime Minister have proved that they continue to have faith in me by being present in the House during the entire debate. The third accusation that I am accused in an exchange control fraud is false and malicious. It is a well known fact that the Rajapaksa regime made several attempts to entangle me unscrupulously in legal battles, including the alleged exchange control matter from which I was honourably discharged by Court. You will surely recall in the course of the debate you too requested the MP to produce documentary evidence of his accusations. The MP vehemently stated that he had sufficient evidence to prove his accusations and said that he would table them. However, the documents he has tabled are not relevant nor do they substantiate the specific charges he leveled at me during the debate. Almost all so-called documents are mere scraps of paper downloaded from gossip websites and unverified notes prepared by himself, the Finance Minister said.
He also invited the chair to peruse those documents and come to a conclusion on their veracity. He added that the MP has deliberately misled the MPs of Parliament.
We have been elected by the people to represent them in Parliament and it is our paramount duty and responsibility to serve them honestly and with commitment. I can assure you that as a MP who has served this House for 21 years continuously, I have acted honestly and true to my conscience, Minister Karunanayake said. There is a saying that those living in glass houses should not throw stones at others. I do not have to emphasize this House as to who has been indicted by Court for undeclared assets as he was unable to explain his ill-gotten gains. Very soon it would be known as to who has robbed the country.
However MP Aluthgamage said that he had tabled all documents to prove the Finance Ministers misdeeds. He added that the Finance Minister was occupying a suite at Monarch Condominium and the son-in-law of the Central Bank Governor was paying the bill. Aluthgamage challenged the Finance Minister to prove it wrong.
At this stage, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that when the matter was referred to the privilege committee there would be an investigation and MP Aluthgamage could provide the proof to that committee. I asked Governor of the Central Bank whether he was paying for a residence of the Finance Minister, Premier said. The Central Bank Governor told me that he did not pay and he had no money to pay for others residences.
Delimitation of boundaries by previous regime: To wipe out minority ethnic representation
The delimitation of ward boundaries have been done during the previous Government with the intention of wiping out the minority ethnic representation, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha said in Parliament yesterday.
He was joining in the debate on media guidelines to be followed by the Electronic and Print Media during referendum and elections. The Minister said all political parties have been in agreement that the delimitation report submitted by the former Delimitation Committee was wrong.
Therefore we wish to appeal against process as of the consent of all parties including the UPFA. Over 1,000 appeals were received and we have had to revise almost all the ward boundaries. Do you expect me to do the task entrusted upon me correctly or do you want me to hold the elections hurriedly based on the previous report of the delimitation committee which all parties had agreed as wrong he asked.
The minister made this comment in reply to the accusation of Joint Opposition MPs Dinesh Gunawardena and Dullas Alahapperuma that the Government was deliberately delaying the Local Government Elections.
The minister said that he had given full freedom to the Delimitation Review Committee to perform its role independently. As the Minister I do not interfere in to the Committees work. Such political interference had been made during the previous Government, he said.
Aluthgamage denies ownership of Defender
Joint Opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage yesterday in Parliament, said the Defender parked at the Madiwela MPs housing complex did not belong to him.
He made this observation rising to a privilege matter yesterday. Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake along with MP Ananda Aluthgamage held a press conference yesterday, accusing that I have a Defender bearing a fake number plate and that this vehicle had been used to commit many crimes. However, the Sports Ministry yesterday evening, issued a release stating that this vehicle is being used by the Deputy Minister of Sports. This vehicle belongs to the Sports Ministry. It does not belong to me, he said.
Deputy Chairman of Committees S Addeikalanathan who was chairing proceedings at that time, asked the MP to submit the privilege issue in writing so that it could be referred to the Privilege Committee after bringing it to the notice of the Speaker.
Increase in VAT: to impose taxes on defaulting businessmen
The Government side members in Parliament said the objective of increasing the Value Added Tax (VAT) was to impose taxes on big businesses that have been defaulting tax payments.
Speaking at a press conference held at the Parliamentary Complex, UNP MP Ajith Mannapperuma said that it also reduces the financial burden on consumers and also narrows the gap between the rich and the poor in the country.
He also said that large businesses have been used to evade paying due taxes and the VAT would reverse this injustice.
He said that according to the increased VAT, any business earning more than Rs 1 million having to pay 15% of their profit in tax. He added that this would not apply to small enterprises. The monies collected from VAT would be mainly used to repay debts of state enterprises such as the Ceylon Petroleum Cooperation, Ceylon Electricity Board and the Sri Lankan Airlines MP Mannapperuma said.
He said single Sri Lankan citizen has roughly Rs 400,000 in debt to pay by now.

During elections: PM calls for banning Advertising by candidates
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday in Parliament suggested including a Clause in the new Constitution to give power to Parliament to either ban media advertising by candidates vying for elections or to impose a ceiling for political parties on such expenditure. He said such a system had been adopted in some European countries.
He was moving a Resolution under the Constitution on the media guidelines to be followed by the Electronic and Print Media during Referenda and Elections.
The media guidelines were published by the Election Commission in the Gazette Extraordinary issued last February.
The Prime Minister commencing the debate on the Resolution said, if the First Past the Post system is adopted under the electoral reforms, the candidates need not spend colossal amounts for media publicity, as the candidates only have small constituency to cover.
Even when candidates are selected by the proportionate representation system, we have to think of imposing a ceiling on the expenditure borne by the Political Parties for media advertising. It is high time that we consider these proposals as we are discussing on electoral reforms based on a hybrid system, he said.
The Prime Minister said the necessity for media guidelines during election time was strongly felt during the previous Presidential Elections.
There were many complaints on the conduct of the State Media during the previous Presidential Elections and some even lodged complaints before the Human Rights Commission. The set of guidelines presented today was a concerted effort by the relevant authorities to correct the situation, he noted.
The Prime Minister observed the Resolution on Media Guidelines and the Right to Information Bill were two important points in the direction of the good governance presented by the Government this week in Parliament under the leadership of the President. When the Prime Minister was speaking at the Joint Opposition (JO) MPs were standing in the House in protest of not allowing MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage to raise a privilege matter.
The JO should not disturb this type of an important debate. You spoke about life threats today. How many journalists were killed during the period of your government If you have any problem, settle it at the office of the Deputy Chairman of Committees.
"Then duly raise the matter next day he told the standing JO members.
It was agreed at the Party Leaders Meeting to debate the media guidelines yesterday, but to postpone approving it in Parliament till the Resolution is overlooked at the Parliamentary Oversight Committee allowing to make any amendments if necessary.

TNA against local mechanism to probe alleged war crimes: Vigneswaran
The TNA disliked any kind of local mechanism which probed alleged war crimes or investigated any other local incident. The TNA will give consideration for any such mechanism only if it included International Judges, Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran said.
Vigneswaran said this when journalists in Jaffna quested him about discussions he had with six foreign ambassadors and representatives of the European Union who met him in Jaffna recently. Vigneswaran said he made the above position known because according to the present environment in the country justice does not seem to be done not only as regards the Courts or any other place.
He said the government had not fulfilled a single request made by the TNA so far. He said solutions could not be found to the problems of Tamils in this country by depending on the views and protests of the so called communal parties in the South. Vigneswaran said he told all foreign deletes who visited the North that the only solution to the Tamil problem was the joining of the Northern and Eastern Provinces and granting them a Federal system of government.
The TNA or the Tamil people had no need to disassociate themselves from this view, Vigneswaran added.

Govt. made AG a partner in political witch-hunt: Vasu
The government has made the Attorney General (AG) a partner in its political witch-hunt against opponents, Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara alleged.
He said the Constitutional Council has been reduced to the position of a rubber stamp of the government.
He was speaking at a press conference organised by the Joint Opposition at the Borella Dr N.M. Perera Memorial Centre yesterday.
Nanayakkara said the governments political witch-hunt against opponents had gained alarming proportions today and said arrest and remanding of people should be done according to some established standard.
Court action taken by the Attorney Generals Department without a proper standard has created a great problem as in the case of Udaya Gammanpila who has been taken in on charges of threatening witnesses residence in Australia. How could he threaten witnessed resident in Australia he asked. Inclusion of Ministers in the Constitutional Council had transformed it into a virtual rubber stamp of the government, he alleged.
He said people appointed as members of various commissions were also people with allegiance to the government. He said the Constitutional Council concept seems to have been prostituted.
He said seniority had not been considered in appointing the Attorney General.

PM launches UNP App to take the country foward
As the UNP turns 70 this September, its leadership is looking at innovative ways to reach out to young voters who could impact the long term sustainability of the party.
The country cannot go forward without the UNP, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as he launched the mobile application UNP App which allows users to obtain an electronic membership from the party for a sum of Rs 20.
I say to the youth, come join us and take the party forward. Our time is soon coming to an end, learn from our experience and take it forward from there, the UNP leader added.
The mobile app, members of the UNP say was a brainchild of its leader and comes at a time when youth and social media have a greater impact at elections than traditional methods of canvassing. It will also give the UNP valuable data on the youth who are interested in the UNP, thus being able to target their policies accordingly. Though our core principles and vision remain the same, the UNP has always been a party which has adapted according to the times. Thus today we launch our electronic membership drive though the UNP App, said UNP General Secretary, Kabir Hashim.
Hashim explained that the app would make it easier for the youth to engage with the party and get the information they need. It is also connected to their other social media sites such as facebook, twitter and Youtube.
The UNP has always been a progressive party, our founders sought independence when nobody thought that was possible and today as we get closer to 70 years, we need to take the country forward. The world is different today from that of 1977 or 1947.
We need to join the world and to do that we need IT technology, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
As the UNP launched its e-membership drive, the Prime Minister recalled that former President J R Jayewardene had them selling membership cards for Rs 1 from house to house but today their app would have reached the people before the party cadres reach their homes.
The app launch yesterday coincided with former President Premadasas birth day and the Prime Minister explained that they would roll out similar new programmes until former President J.R. Jayewardenes birthday on September 17.
