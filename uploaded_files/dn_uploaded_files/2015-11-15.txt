Malta to host next Commonwealth summit: Sharma
Malta is to host the next Commonwealth summit after Mauritius pulled out in protest over the decision to hold this years gathering in Sri Lanka, the organisation said Sunday.

The prime minister of Malta has invited the Commonwealth to hold CHOGM (Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting) 2015, with Malta as the venue, secretary general Kamalesh Sharma said at the end of the summit in Colombo.

It (the offer) was received by all members with acclamation, Sharma told reporters.

Mauritius had been due to stage the biennial gathering in 2015 but its prime minister Navin Chandra Ramgoolam announced just ahead of the Colombo gathering that it no longer wanted to play the role of hosts, citing Sri Lankas human rights record.

I have made it perfectly clear that human rights are more important than hosting a Commonwealth summit, regardless of its importance, Ramgoolam, who boycotted the Colombo summit, told lawmakers.

The leaders of India and Canada also stayed away from this years summit after allegations of war crimes committed by Sri Lankan government forces at the end of the countrys 37-year ethnic conflict. AFP

SL to considers proposal to release 217 tamils
The Sri Lankan government is considering a proposal to release the 217 Tamils currently in detention under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), after putting them through a program of rehabilitation, the Minister of National Dialogue, Mano Ganeshan, told The Sunday Standard.

Ganeshan recalled that the Mahinda Rajapaksa government had released over 12,000 LTTE cadres, after subjecting them to a rehabilitation program. He said that the Lankan Security Forces have developed expertise in the rehabilitation of militants, and the facilities at the rehabilitation centers are now of international standard. They dont look like torture centers, as they did in early days, Ganeshan said.

But for the time being, the policy is to release the detainees on bail on a case-by-case basis. On November 11, 31 detainees were to be released on bail but since no one came to stand surety for them, the prisoners were sent back to prison. Each released detainee had to have two LKR (Sri Lankan Rupee) one million bonds. They would also be required to report to the Terrorism Investigation Department every other Sunday. They would be barred from leaving the island.

There is, however, no unanimity on the number of civilians killed in the Eelam War IV. The United Nations Secretary Generals 2011 committee, headed by Indonesian diplomat Marzuki Darusman, said that up to 40,000 might have been killed. But a government census survey conducted after the return of the displaced persons, found that 8,000 were killed. 

Navy to take over floating armoury

Colombo: Lankan President M Sirisena, on November 11, ordered the navy to take over the operations of Avant Garde Maritime Services Ltd. (AGMS), a company which has a floating armoury, lending weapons to vessels operating in the pirate-infested areas of the Indian Ocean. The decision came after a stormy cabinet meeting.
