Remembering  Kandys sporting  greats

Now that the Rio Olympic Games is in progress it will be interesting to unearth some interesting facts about past heroes from Kandy. It was a Kandy school product who won the first Olympic medal. The unique feature is to recognize and appreciate Kandy's top sportsmen in boxing and athletics.
Duncan White won his Olympic medal the same year Ceylon gained independence from Britain in 1948. At the Wembley Olympic 400 metres hurdles, the most colourful of all track events, there was an obscure youth from a little known island. The loud-speakers blared their names: Two Americans confident of winning, a dour Swede, a swarthy Italian.
Then the announcer said Duncan White of Ceylon. What notice did anyone take of the lanky youth in the sixth lane The pistol cracked and the athletes went flat out like greyhounds. The blonde American sped strongly, the Swede also did same, and so did the man from somewhere. At the penultimate hurdle his youth, build and self-confidence saw the American gaining. But now Duncan White made his super effort, the moment he had been waiting for. Big of heart and with determination writ all over his face he flashed fast ahead of the Swede to take second place. Thus were Kandy and Ceylon engraved on the sports map of the world.
In 1937, Trinity College perhaps the best schoolboy cricketing side of that year were at practice. One afternoon Duncan was training on the school grounds at Asgiriya for the AAA meet. He was encroaching on to the lst XI cricket practising area at Asgiriya. White had a practice 100 yards sprint and it was something so magnificent that the whole cricket training squad stopped and watched and cheered the grand sprinter. Supple limbs and the fighting heart of a champion and perfect athlete.
Like Johnny Weismuller or any succeeding Tarzan, Duncan, it appeared, was an irresponsible youngster. There is the story that while waiting for an interview to join the Ceylon Police Force, Duncan found time hanging on his hands. A little later one of the selectors heard a complaint that some people from the police barracks had plucked young coconuts from an adjoining garden. The culprit was found to be White! He had seldom taken up to studies seriously. But when training for a meet all others were unimportant. White trained with determination to win.
At Trinity Duncan White won his Lion in Athletics. He captained the athletic team. He was also a ruggerite of repute as rugby in the lives of all students at Trinity. He broke the Public Schools 220 yards record and won the 120 yards hurdles event and long jump. He also established a 440 yards record and was selected to participate at first Empire Games held in Australia in 1938. He was national champion for many years in the following events - 120 yards hurdles, 440 yards hurdles and 400 metres hurdles.
He led the first Ceylon Olympic team to London in 1948 and won the Silver Medal in 400 meters hurdles, the first and only Ceylonese to win an Olympic Medal at that time. He won the 440 yards hurdles at the first Indo-Ceylon contest, smashing the Indian record. He became the British and Irish Universities 440 yards hurdles champion and record holder while at Loughborough College, UK. He also captained the Ceylon team to Commonwealth Games in New Zealand and took the Gold Medal in 440 yards hurdles with a new record.
Duncan White was awarded the MBE for his contribution to sports, the first sportsman in Ceylon to be thus honoured. He was selected Sportsman of the Year by public polls. He obtained the Diploma in Physical Education of Loughborough College, UK in 1951 and was appointed Ceylon's National Athletics coach in 1958. He left Ceylon subsequently to take up an appointment as Director of Athletics at University of Ibadan, Nigeria.
Leslie Donovan Perera Handunge Lesley Handunge was the second son of Kandy to blaze the Olympic trail. He represented Ceylon at the 1948 Olympic Games and was the first Ceylonese to enter an Olympic ring and win an Olympic bout he led the Ceylon team to the 1952 Olympic Games. One time Director of Physical Education of the Peradeniya University, Handunge had his graduation at Trinity College in four major games - Cricket, Boxing, Rugger and Athletics. After leaving school, he played inter-club hockey, football and rugger for Kandy Sports Club and Kandy YMCA. Late Handunge was a Diploma holder in Physical Education of Loughborough College, UK.
He was the first Ceylonese to obtain this Diploma and obtained his Master's Degree in Physical Education from Springfield, USA. He had to work his way through at both these institutions. He won his first National title in 1944, the Flyweight category. He won the Best Boxer's Award at the Intermediate, Meet. Albert Perera Farewell Meet and National Championships.
He represented the University of Ceylon at boxing and rugger and was the British and Irish University Bantamweight champion boxer while at Loughbrough College. Handunge was invited by the ABA of Ceylon to participate in the final boxing trial for the 1950 Empire Games, but was unable to leave for England. He retired as undefeated Flyweight Boxing Champion of Ceylon in 1952. Sellapuliyage Lucien Benedict Rosa S.L.B ROSA - When he was picked for the Munich Olympics, he became the third son of Kandy to represent Ceylon. He was an athlete and was best in the 10,000 metres and the marathon. The big-hearted village boy from Ampitya had his education at St. Berreaweart's College. When he participated in the Olympics the talk in Kandy was will he run barefooted or will he wear spikes Rosa's rise to fame has been meteoric.
A product of one of the humbler Roman Catholic Schools in Kandy, it was only after joining the Army as a Sapper that he began to show up as an athlete. All the reputed long distance runners at the time were from Ampitiya, and for a time they were his seniors. But serious training and dedication established him in good stead as our foremost long distance runner.
He was born stricken by a dangerous virus ailments, but when parents and doctors pulled him through, he lost his father, a railway worker when he (Rosa) was barely four years old. But the widowed mother took great pain to groom her son Rosa to become an athlete of great talent. Rosa was commonly seen running round the Kandy Lake. Then Tommy Arthur, Ampitiya's athletic coach took charge of Rosa for scheduled training. Then enlisted him in the 1st Field Regiment, Ceylon Engineers of the Army. Col. P. D. Ramanayake, a great sports promoter and his Commanding Officer took him in hand.
Rosa started winning almost all major awards at AAA and Service Meets. Later he left the Army for the Ceylon Transport Board which offered better employment prospects. He achieved his highest goal when he won the 5,000 and 10,000 metres at an Asian Games. He established a new Asian Games record for the 10,000 metres with timing of 29 minutes - 55.6 seconds. He won the 5,000, meters with timing of 14 minutes. 32.2 seconds. His 10,000 meters timing was bettered by only five Olympic champions at that time.

TSLC tap expertise of Vaas and Pothas

Chaminda Vaas has been appointed Sri Lanka Crickets fast-bowling consultant, fifteen months after his contract as the national teams bowling coach lapsed. The focus of his new role will be on identifying and developing fast-bowling talent from around the country, rather than on working specifically with the national team.
Sri Lankas cricket consultant Aravinda de Silva had been the primary force behind the appointment, and said it was important for the board to tap into skills of its former players.
Ive been trying to get a few former cricketers to agree to work with us, he said.
When I spoke with Vaas, he was very keen. We feel he will be really good working with some of our young cricketers, from the grassroots levels. Hell work with fast bowlers from around the country, identify talent, get them in to work with the under-19, development and A team squads, which feed into the national team.
De Silva outlined a vision to use SLCs coaches more liberally in the districts further afield from Colombos cricket hub. Both Vaas and new fielding coach Nic Pothas will be expected to travel widely in their roles, spotting talent and buttressing coaching work.
We want our coaches to go deep into the district and provincial levels, and also to help the clubs, de Silva said. If any coach in a club needs some assistance, were happy to allocate some of the bowling coaches to go and spend some time with those relevant clubs. We want to put some schedules together so they can go right around the country - Vaas job will be one of those. He will be a floating coach who will go around and do the identification.
The present board had already installed Graham Ford as head coach, Simon Willis as high performance manager and Pothas as fielding coach.
Pothas began his tenure on August 8, and said existing relationships with Ford, Willis and trainer Michael Main would ease his transition.
Ive known Graham Ford for a very long time, and Ive had the pleasure over the years of actually playing under Graham Ford, he said.
Ive known Simon Willis from the UK, and Michael Main was the strength and conditioning coach when I worked at Hampshire, so there are a lot of friends and a lot of familiar faces.
[Im hoping to] change the fielding culture here, and bring about a change in the language we use around fielding. Its the part of the game where we spend most of our time. You can get a good delivery or a bad decision as a batsman, but you can still influence the game with your fielding. Ive always seen fielding as the way that you show your teammates how much you care about them, Pothas said.

We totally managed secured gate collections of Rs. 2.9 million which is a huge amount of money for two and a half days of a Test, which we had never expected, Sumathipala said.
