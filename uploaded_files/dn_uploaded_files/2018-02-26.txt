Expats paid heavily while Lankans sent for pittance overseas
Sri Lankan corporates brings down foreign CEOs and Administrators to work in Sri Lanka and pay them around Rs. Six to 20 million monthly while sending Sri Lankan house wives and unskilled workers overseas for jobs for around Rs. 40,000.
This was said by youngest CEO of a multinational in Sri Lanka Kishu Gomes of Caltex Lubricants Lanka fame at the inauguration of the EDULINK ICON Business Schools ACCA course. He said that to bring back a salary of one foreign CEO Sri Lanka has to export 20 unskilled workers. This huge imbalance can only be corrected by producing skilled education for Sri Lanka youth and then export them for higher salaries.
Though Sri Lanka boasts of a 95.5% literacy rate the education is not focused towards fulfilling the requirements of the current demands of work. The education syllabuses are outdated.
For this the politicians of successive governments are responsible as they have not fine-tuned the education sector to meet neither the present nor future employee demands.
Gomes emotionally pointed out that about 25, 000 schoolchildren in Sri Lanka in rural areas have to travel round 10 kilo meters per day to school. Out of this number 25% of children walk barefoot to school and dont have a luxury to eat in the morning. They only have their first meal at 3 30 p.m. He said that the country cannot expect politicians to create a better tomorrow for them as successive governments since independence have failed in this regard. We along with institutions like EDULINK ICON Business School have to come with solutions.
Commenting on the way forward for Sri Lanka he said that the best option for the nation is not agriculture, technology but people.
While Sri Lanka spends Rs. 40 to produce a kilo of paddy, India, Thailand, Malaysia Vietnam and Indonesia does it for Rs. 20. Its the same scenario with technology as we still try to build a coconut plucking machine while the world is far ahead. Hence this is not the way forward.
India has successfully invested in focused education for children and today its one of the biggest countries that exporter professionals and Sri Lanka too should take a leaf from that.

Girambe Ananda Thera rendered great service towards Sasana, society
The cremation of the Most Ven. Girambe Ananda Anunayake Thera, Viharadhipati of the Sri Sarananda Maha Piriven Viharaya, Anuradhapura was held under state patronage at the Anuradhapura Harischandra Park amidst a large gathering including VIPs last Saturday.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a funeral oration said the late Thera rendered a great service towards the Sambuddha Sasana and society by moving forward overcoming various obstacles on his path. Following in the footsteps of Walisingha Harischandra, who began the Buddhist revival in the Raja Rata, the Ven. Girambe Ananda Thera came and settled down in Anuradhapura and set up the Sarananda Maha Pirivena and many Buddhist Viharyas there and abroad.
The Prime Minister delivering
a speech at the funeral.
He had set up a new Sangha generation which was a pride to the Sarananda Sangha clan and the great Sasana service rendered by him is eternally etched in the hearts and minds of all, the Prime Minister said.
The Ven. Girambe Ananda Thera, who held several important positions in the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya, was gifted with great management skills. He was outspoken on matters which concerned the Buddha Sasana, the Premier said.
He toured the country delivering religious discourses. Although he gave Buddhism its pre-eminent place, he never criticised or harmed other religions.Although he had opportunities to settle down in Colombo or Kandy, he stayed back in Anuradhapura and paid special attention and care to backward villages in the region. Villagers which benefited from his service were many and that was one reason why people everywhere were saddened about his demise, the Prime Minister said
The late Ven. Girambe Ananda Thera offered leadership in matters concerning politics. He offered vital counsel to the late Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake, the late Presidents J.R. Jayewardene and R. Premadasa by closely associating with them, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister said that there were even times when the late Thera criticised him. The late Thera said he criticised him (Prime Minister) with good intentions to correct him. The movement they launched towards establishment of good governance succeeded partly due to the silent leadership offered by the late Thera.
The best way to pay homage to the late Thera was to carry forward the service rendered by him. While thanking the late Thera for his service, the Prime Minister wished the late Thera the eternal bliss of Nibbana.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the late Thera rendered an epochal service towards creating a good society. He had occasion to associate with the late Thera for several decades. The Sarananda Pirivena started by him rendered a great service towards Bhikkhu education.
He assisted in ordaining 1,000 Samanera bhikkhus during the Buddha Jayanthi Celebrations held in 2006. During the 1983 Communal riots, the late Thera offered succour and solace to hundreds of innocent Tamil civilians. The late Theras demise was a great loss to the country in general and the Ramanna Nikayaya in particular.
The Most Ven. Napane Pemasiri Mahanayaka Thera of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya and the late Ananda Thera took steps to propagate the Buddha Dhamma here and abroad and rendered an immense social service. He was an exemplary bhikkhu who was loved and adored by people especially in Raja Rata, Kurunegala and Kandy regions.
The Most Ven. Kotugoda Dhammawasa Supreme Maha Nayake Thera of the Amarapura Maha Sangha Sabha, the Most Ven. Anamaduwe Dhammadassai Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter and several others spoke.
Minister Kabir Hashim, Gamini Jayawickreme Perera, Daya Gamage, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Vajira Abeywardena, P. Harrison, Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Chandram Bandara, and Thalatha Athukorale, Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna, State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene and Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanyake were present.

Malicious forces trying to subvert Buddhism
Malicious forces are conspiring to ruin the moral conduct and noble practices and traditions of Buddhists and to mislead and draw our young Buddhist monks towards fruitless and hopeless struggles, said Southern Province Governor Dr. Hemakumara Nanayakkara said.
The foremost objective of such vicious forces is to generate discord among the Maha Sangha and thereby to promote schism and destroy pure Buddhism and a spotless Buddhist society, the governor said.
He made the above remarks at the ceremony to offer credentials to Chief Incumbent of the Keeridola Daham-Lena Aranya Senasana in Elpitiya and Panna Pradeepa Bhavana Madyasthanaya of Thalgaspe in Galle, Ven. Ronnaduwe Gnanathilake in respect of his appointment as Galle District Deputy Sanghanayake of Shyamopali Vanavasa Maha Nikaya of Maha Vihara.
Since time immemorial, our venerable Maha Sangha has rendered an enormous contribution dedicating their lives to raise the Buddha Sasana and our motherland. Hence it is the obligation and duty of all Buddhists to protect and foster the Maha Sangha by providing them with Siv Pasa Upasthana. However, it is regrettable to note that there is a remarkable dearth in the number of discipline-compliant Buddhist monks today. In some areas, certain Buddhist temples have been devastated and closed down owing to the absence of Buddhist monks, he added.
The Governor who observed that some non-governmental organisations and institutions at present had launched discourteous missions by way of forming new religious sects to convert Buddhists into other faiths or cults, urged that the state rules and regulations instituted in respect of such unwarranted operations should be further strengthened and implemented properly and firmly.
Since the time of the ancient kings, the Maha Sangha always provided necessary guidance and advice in the rule of the country. A wide scope colloquium between the Maha Sangha and state rulers should be convened without further delay to review, discuss and formulate and introduce new preventive initiatives to arrest the adverse growth that is presently taking place in Buddhism and the Buddha Sasana, he reiterated.
A large number of the members of the Maha Sangha, regional politicians that included Parliamentary Affairs and Lands Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, Law and Order State Minister Piyasena Gamage and former Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe participated.

Siva Obeyesekere
An honourable matriarch
Sivagamie Verina Obeyesekere entered Ladies College when G.F. Opie was its principal. She joined first as a boarder at Gaster House, then went through four years of evacuation to Kandy, during the war years and relocated in Colombo in 1945. Siva was nurtured by Ladies College. The Matrons, Wilkie and Georgina Ponniah, made the hostel a second home for their young charges, and Siva enjoyed boarding life, making it interesting and happy for all others. In 1940, Siva came first in the standard 5 government examinations and Opie gifted her with a small Gem Dictionary and requested her to care for and assist Ladies College.
If ever a pupil lived up to the creed of From those to whom much is given of them, also is much expected, it was Siva. Siva was a born leader. Whether it was in the school hall helping with kala ulela plays, forging ahead with Loos House activities or winning the Westrop Shield for Netball, Siva knew how to get the best out of a team.
The disciplined way of life in the hostel helped Siva later in life. The Saturday morning mending hour taught the boarders to sew, darn, fix buttons, which inspired her later to set up sewing classes in Attanagalla and Mirigama for unemployed girls. Likewise, the home beautiful week programmes taught boarders that nothing was menial, and they put their hearts and souls into the cleaning of kitchens, toilets, and drains. Siva later used these skills when visiting hospitals as the Health Minister, and she was able to show the staff how cleanliness in every sector could be achieved.
Siva loved sports and she was Games Captain at uplands and Colombo for three years each and won both netball and tennis with flying colours. With the staff, she took on the responsibility of organising all sports activities, including the annual sports meet until the arrival of Wyness from Australia, who took over as Games Mistress. One of the most vivid memories of our school days was the winning of the Westrop Shield, which was won by Ladies College two years in a row. We still remember Siva shooting those winning goals. Our teacher Simon even declared a holiday in celebration of our victory over Bishops College.
Siva's scholarship endeavours were cut short on the eve of her university entrance exam when she married hi-flyer J. P. Obeyesekere, Jr. This wedding, which took place in 1948, at the Chapel of the Hope of the World, was an unforgettable event. The Chapel and its garden overflowed with staff and schoolgirls. Tradition always meant a lot to Siva, and through the PTA, OGA, the Board of Governors and the Standing Committee of the Church, she has held the school together through all its changes. From the first little hostellers Oriental Night in 1946 (in aid of a Christmas treat for the deaf and blind schoolchildren who were housed in a shed near Gaster House), when they made a collection of Rs. 16,375, later through festivals, dinner dances, fairs, and talentasias, Siva organized innumerable fundraisers. She collected funds for the school through the OGA, PTA and on her own, for school buildings, scholarships, the sports complex, and most visionary of all, the setting-up of the Vocational Training Institute with Sirancee Gunawardana.
The collections amounted to a great deal of money over 50 years, and it is not possible to enumerate the variety of fun-filled festivities Siva organized, which will forever remain in the memories of all those who participated. With the training we Ladies College girls received through the Annual CMS sales and the cooperation Siva was able to muster, she was able to collect funds for so many projects, as and when they were needed. Siva became a high-achiever, not for herself but for the school and the wider world around. Her concern for the underprivileged and financially-deprived was genuine.
From 1981, through her contact with a womens organization in Stockholm, Fredrika Vremer Forbundet, Siva obtained assistance for needy students following courses at the DVS. An annual grant is sent and Rs. 2.5 million has been received to date, which has helped nearly 4,000 students to secure education and gain employment.
Siva became the MP for Mirigama and sat in the Opposition for five years. In the next Parliament, she was appointed at first, Deputy Health Minister, and then Health Minister. This was by no means a ceremonial role. She put her heart and soul into its activities. In spite of her important and onerous duties, she still found time for her college, organising Ladies College fairs. Siva helped to develop the preventive medicine sector which had then been a low-profile branch at the best of times.
It is impossible to enumerate the number of programmes Siva pushed through. The Thriposha programme (assisted by Ladies College past pupil Dr. Brighty de Mel) is one for which the mothers and children will forever rise up and call them blessed. The multi-disciplinary approach Siva adopted, through a multi-ministerial committee to carry through her family health programmes, won for Sri Lanka the first UNFPA grant of US$ 6 million awarded to a developing country. In 1976, the UN acclaimed Sri Lankas family health programme as a model for the world. The year 1977 saw Siva elected as Vice President for Asia at the WHO Conference in Geneva. Family health workers, graduate educators, and midwives on bicycles were all a part of the health scene and offered a blueprint for family health and population control worldwide.
In 1974, the International Year for Women, Siva was appointed Chair of the National Committee for Women, which proposed the establishment of a Womens Bureau and led to the establishment of the Womens Affairs Ministry. The other role in which Siva played a part in is the revival of crafts in Sri Lanka. At the bottom of the scale were the neglected craftspeople whose skills were dying due to the lack of governmental support and national recognition, and primarily, because they did not earn a fair price for their products. In 1964, Laksala was born; Siva Obeyesekeres brain-child. Her Guru in India was Kamaladevi Chattoadhaya, whose guidance was followed in reviving the handicrafts and hand-loom industries of Sri Lanka.
Sivas work in the political arena does not overshadow her work in voluntary organisations. At the CNAPT, she ran the TB Seals Campaign and came only second to Bandaranaike in Flag Day Collections. In the Cancer Society, she was one of the prime movers in changing the direction of its activities by establishing branches in Kandy, Galle, Jaffna, and Batticaloa. She made devolution a reality. Sivas interests covered a range of activities such as the scout movement, bible society, schools for the deaf and blind, the mentally disabled, cancer institutes, and even the Kennel Association of Sri Lanka.
Being the first woman Deshamanya is a singular honour to Siva and to Ladies College. The confidence with which she addressed an assembly of 5,000 delegates at a UN Conference in Romania or 3,000 delegates at a WHO Meeting in Geneva was gained in the school of life, beginning with Ladies College. Her association with the school remained unbroken through a long line of principals: G. F. Opie, Mabel Simon, Olive Hitchcock; Acting Principals Rita Opie, Harriet de Kretser, and Dulcie Leembruggen; and her colleague and friend Sirancee Gunawardana, the first Sri Lankan Principal.
I once asked Siva if she had any special memories and her reply was, "Yes, winning a courtesy badge, along with Anoja Amarasinghe and some others in 1941." Ladies' College was a school where values such as courtesy were graded on the report as A, B, C, and D.
Under Sivas guidance, the OGA became a vibrant and active body fired with enthusiasm and geared towards the development of the school.
Every activity had its own reward and success, but similar to a phoenix, Siva would rise above all difficulties and be ready to embark on new and better projects every time. Speaking as one who has given most of her life to the development of Christian educational institutions such as Ladies College, S. Thomas College, the Church and College of St. Marys at Veyangoda, and to a small extent, the Schools for the Deaf and Blind, Siva said she had no regrets; only joy.
Her husband, children, and grandchildren had always supported her activities. Siva has proved that educational qualifications are not the important criterion, but rather, sincerity of purpose, commitment, dedication, and sacrifice.

Dr. A. M. M. Sahabdeen
Man of wisdom
My grandfather Dr. A. M. M. Sahabdeen, represented to me a pinnacle of philosophy; its truest and traditional sense, as the love of wisdom which cannot be separated in any way from the spirituality of a person. He always spoke from a perspective that was universal in scope, so that difficulties of ordinary life would be measured against the most fundamental values of the human being; namely, his or her intrinsic morality and the relationship between human beings and the cosmos. Often this would have the effect of dissolving whatever problem one brought to him at its root.
In fact, this manner of counsel did not arise merely from the accumulation of practical experiences, as can be expected generally from an elderly person. Rather, it had its roots in a certain worldview, specifically in his metaphysical outlook. He was a man of mystical disposition, infused with the natural Islamic mysticism that was a part of his childhood and which is synonymous with Islam in Sri Lanka. Whilst religion is still practiced in Sri Lanka, it can often be done in an unconscious manner, with the rites and rituals being performed without any sense of their deeper meaning. In contrast, my grandfather meditated on its deeper meaning. That deeper meaning is, in one word, Ar-Rahman; the all-transcendent God of mercy.
In the years leading up to his death, there were several occasions where my grandfather temporarily lost consciousness. The family would rush to his side, and when he recovered, he would tell us "There is a mind behind it all!" In fact, his last words to my aunt, uncle, and cousins were "There is no beginning or end, only eternal light." I have no doubt that he did in fact have access to that mystical insight, if even for just a timeless moment.
Sometimes in life, we are blessed in encountering a person whose very essence we recognise as our own, and so it was with my grandfather. His interests were the same as mine, and I recognised in his smallest reflexes, the same patterns of thought that were my own. I could say that even if we spoke no words, it would have been understood. As such, it was not only an occasion of learning when I spent afternoons and evenings discussing philosophy with him, it was spiritual relief to find my kindred spirit. We had many conversations which touched my soul, and I remember more than one occasion, where I would walk away and the whole world would be bathed in a different light. Our discussions were invariably metaphysical or philosophical in nature, and he would usually bring me to a logical impasse in Western philosophy before providing a way out; sometimes, through guidance stepped in the Eastern tradition, but perhaps more often and more importantly, through his presence and serenity, which told me that the way out was never in doubt; it was simply a matter of intellection, of having true insight into the fundamental harmony of existents.
He was my first teacher and spiritual companion. Perhaps the most important evening I ever spent with him was when he recited a couplet of poetry to me which his grandfather had once uttered. I must have been around ten years old at the time. He prefaced it by mentioning that these words had created an impression in his heart, and that it was the reason he still remembered them seven decades later:
From the primordial cave arose a self-sustaining light; the light became breath and speech.
Our family had the blessing of being with my grandfather at the time of his death. We performed mystical litanies, recited the Qur'an and sang songs of praise. In the days leading up to it, I noticed how peaceful he was when we recited prayers. His life had been an anticipation for this moment; the meeting between him and his creator, the return to the source of all beauty. What better way to leave than with the accompaniment of prayers and songs and the love of family, as we willed for him an easy and graceful journey home. In the following days, the debt of gratitude I felt towards him was complemented by my happiness that this man who had spent so much of his life contemplating the supreme reality, was finally experiencing it for himself.
There were many moments to be grateful for around that time. One of his employees, a gentleman around 90 years old named Thiru, coming out of loyalty to recite a Hindu prayer in his ear was one of them, as was the love and tears of the children whom he had helped with his charitable endeavours. I met people of all religions who felt gratitude towards him, and to me, this was the greatest tribute that could have been made for him, as his good deeds went beyond particular denominations and communities.
My grandfather's final teaching to me was about the beauty of my own home, an island where universalism traced its history back to antiquity, and where the fragrance of paradise was infinitely near.
The mind of a philosopher requires an object of contemplation for its happiness. For such a person, there can be only one object which would provide satisfaction. It is the one transcendent object, or the one supreme subject; the sbsolutely-transcendent and the infinitely-immanent good. This was what my grandfather chose in his life, and it is this legacy which his children and grandchildren will carry in their hearts, with gratitude that reaches the stars.
Verily we are from God, and to him we shall return.

In Memoriam: Pathma Ponnambalam
Is it a dream or has she really goneI will know when I awake ontomorrows morn.To whom can I look when I seek adviceSomeone like you, kind, patient and wise.You never sided with us, just because wewere yoursChoosing instead the one who was right.What is honest is honourable was your creedFor material possessions you had no greed.You were truly a loving and supportive wife,And made adjustments to your privileged life."How are you, mummy" Id often inquire"Very well, thank you; no help I require!"Your principles were high, your values sound,When you were right, you stood your ground.You never courted the famous or rich,But humble folks lives, you did enrich.We admired your intellect and brains,You used it not for career or fame.Never once complaining, always upbeatFor the welfare of family, your life you did lead.

Dr. D. A. Ilapperuma
Noble physician
February 19 was the death anniversary of late Dr. D. A. Ilapperuma of Talpitiya, Wadduwa. He, as a physician, cured many patients sought his treatment. Dr. Ilapperuma was a specialist in high blood pressure, paralysis, heart ailments, and diabetes. He was also a visiting physician at the Central Hospital and a member of the Ayurveda College and Hospital Board and Ayurveda Pharmacopoeia Committee.
A special quality he possessed was that in treating a patient, he compared the laboratory tests of the Western system with his advanced knowledge of diagnosing a sickness by feeling the pulses of the patient and thus, treating him. A special virtue in him was his human attitude towards those who came to him.
He treated the rich and the poor alike. Another significant feature of his was that he treated the clergy of all religions without a fee.
He had a great desire to compile an ayurvedic medicinal journal as in the western medicinal system and get those medicine manufactured by the state or by recognised and registered private institutions.
Once this was accomplished, the drugs were made available to local Ayurvedic dispensaries, thereby providing facilities to Ayurvedic medical practitioners.
Dr. Ilapperuma had preserved all forms of traditional clinical methods and secret formulae of treatment and had rendered a great service in getting those particulars documented.
He did not amass wealth, but served humanity. It is with satisfaction I mention that he had left behind a son and a daughter who follow his noble footsteps.
His son and the daughter, who have learnt the traditional forms and practices, are qualified graduates with a wealth of experience.
They are currently carrying on the good work of their dear father. I wish them good luck and success.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Esther Hay
She lived an exemplary life
I am humbled to pen in a few words on my friend and former colleague Esther Hay, fondly referred to as Esther, who lived a quiet and simple life in Roxy Gardens, Dehiwela.
After a brief stint at the High Court, Esther joined Ford, Rhodes, St. Thornton Co. (currently KPMG Sri Lanka) where she served for over 50 years. She was loved by her colleagues, past and present and always reminded us of the bounties of God, and by her love for him, encouraged us to be the best, most humane version of ourselves. She always dressed her best and made sure she greeted and gifted us on special days.
Esther was the only child to Ron and Girlie Van Eyck. She married Donald Hay and was widowed just nine years after marriage. The marriage blessed her with two sons; Warren and Damien Hay, whom she raised on her own. Damien and his wife Shyomi gave Esther two granddaughters named Grace and Kylie, with whom she spent most of her later years.
Esther will be remembered for the exemplary life she lived by touching the hearts of those around her, especially the sick and lonely, towards whom she showed her limitless compassion and love. She was involved in various humanitarian projects at the slums along her neighborhood, the Cancer Hospital, and elders homes to name a few.
As Marcus Tullius Cicero once said;
The life of the dead is placed in the memory of the living.
By this, you will always live in our hearts.
Rest in peace, Esther. You are deeply missed.

Are Sri Lanka and SAARC region capable of tackling any cyber threat 
Cyber threat refers to the possibility of a malicious attempt to damage or disrupt a particular computer network or system. Across the world the threat of such acts loom over every IT system, however with companies such as Sophos battling to keep the systems of their customers safe and threat-free cyber criminals have indeed met their match.
Sophos Technologies was established in 1985 in the UK. For the last 32 years, the company has been built on pure technical solidity and started to acquire companies since the early 2000s in order to complete the product portfolio. Being one of the oldest in the global security space, Sophos also sees continued YoY growth, mirroring its solidified business.
Commenting on the current portfolio of Sophos, Sunil Sharma, Managing Director of Sales (India and SAARC) of Sophos Technologies (Pvt.) Ltd. stated that at present, Sophos has primary research and development centers in 5 locations globally, with India being one of them. With 22% - 25% of the companys workforce based out of India, there is great focus on India and the SAARC region as part of Sophos long-term vision and plan. The business model of Sophos constitutes of 16 branches in India, Regional Heads for the rest of the countries, and a mo1del based purely on distributors in smaller markets such as Nepal and Bhutan.
Sophos is handled by Avian Technologies in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, a relationship counting almost a decade. According to Sharma the partner eco system is of high importance to Sophos. Sophos worldwide does 100% business through channels only. One of our mission statements is a Channel-first commitment. Therefore, the only eco system that matters to us is the channel eco system. For us loyalty with partners is paramount. At Sophos we believe that a partnership is a give and take relationship. This is what has prompted us to work with Avian, as they have been in the industry for a considerable time, and have repeatedly proven their capability in building our business, added Sharma.
Regarding the greatest challenge in Cyber Security as perceived by Sophos, he explained that he would prefer not to name one definite threat as he believed that the only thing companies like Sophos needed to do was to think and work faster than cyber criminals.
In considering cyber threats, there are three different kinds; Global Cyber Warfare, State Sponsored Hacking and Attacks to the corporate business. For example, Ransomware, Malware, Advance Persistence Threats (APTs). In view of these, Sophos is very much prepared. We advocate a system, which is called synchronized security; its a very coordinated defense mechanism, which looks into both the end point as well as the network security. Cyber threat can enter at any point. A network security firewall alone will not make one safe. At one-point cyber security concentrated only on IPS or Network security firewall email gateway or web security gateway, but we have evolved beyond that. A complete security system should cover all potential threat points, and each point should be linked with one another. In this way, even the minutest breach will indicate that something has been compromised and the complete defense mechanism kicks off. We have proactive systems put in place by which the affected system is being quarantined, treated and put back as a clean system. It is with this simple philosophy that Sophos works worldwide.
Sunil Sharma went on to explain that Sophos also has Cloud based solutions. This is a cost-effective system where clients have access to Sophos Central, a management console on the cloud, which gives access to a dashboard to CIO s and IT Managers. Sophos MSP  Managed Security Provider  caters to SME customers who are cost conscious and work with limited resources. This flexible option has been launched in India and will be expanding to the rest of the region. The MSP is integrated with Sophos Central and is compatible with local network software.
Network security is a 24x7 process. Sophos processes about 400,000 malwares daily at the Sophos threat lab.
The products are updated at an on-going basis. This involves a huge back-end operation, research and development in addition to maintenance to ensure that our customers are protected. I regularly come across the question, Does this mean the customer does not get attacked said Sharma. Customers are bound to be attacked.
Will it increase Yes. The solution to it is a vendor who takes care of you by deploying the right solution and a coordinated defense mechanism.
The other main aspect, which Sophos is involved in, is Education. Phishing attacks are very common, but in spite of knowing an email could be a phishing email, people still click it. Phish Threat, introduced by Sophos, is a product for the internal system to educate users about Phishing. It can also simulate attacks to better educate the user.
As part of social responsibility, Sophos has also initiated Sophos Home, which is provided free of cost. It is a commercial grade phenomenal product, an anti-virus that has the latest capabilities, which can be downloaded free to your device.
Presenting his opinion on the cyber security landscape in Sri Lanka and the region, Sharma said, My personal opinion is that Sri Lanka has great potential. It is on par with India, with only the size and volume making the difference. People are equally Internet savvy and the threats we face are the same. Along with Avian Technologies, Sophos continues to achieve milestones every year and yet it is a matter of miles to go before we sleep. South Asia is a developing economy resulting in differences in terms of use of technology and purchasing habits in comparison to the West. Worldwide, I see huge potential in cyber security.
The cyber security market is 39 billion USD worldwide, and is expected to grow to 48 billion USD by 2020. Therefore, as a company Sophos has a lot of work to be done, whether in terms of creating awareness with customers and resellers, or in giving a complete end-to-end solution to customers so that they can be protected and at the same time reducing the complexity in solutions and providing simplicity. This is a job for the entire security industry.
Sophos considers Sri Lanka as a very important market as it foresaw that Sri Lanka was going to develop and has huge potential and scope. The company has invested to the length of having their own resource in addition to the distributor, so that the customer has direct access when they face issues. Along with Avian Technologies, Sophos is able to provide pre-sales support for resellers as well as post sales support proactively. Sophos has separate training programmes for partners on both pre and post sales as well as quarterly online and on-site training. Sophos is a product which has a lot of involvement and that is what makes it very strong, declared Sunil Sharma.

Bank Of China files Patent for  new Blockchain Scaling Solution
The commercial, state-run Bank of China, not to be confused with the Peoples Bank of China, the countrys central bank, has filed a patent with the Chinese State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) for a solution to scale Blockchain technology systems, according to local news outlet tech.ifeng.
The bank originally applied for the patent on Sept. 28, 2017, with a Zhao Shuxiang indicated as the patents inventor, but SIPO only released news of the patent on Feb. 23, 2018.
The patent contains a method for compressing Blockchain data that seeks to solve the problem of storage space in new blocks without compromising on traceability and immutability.
As described in the patent, the amount of data stored in in new blocks would be reduced in the following way: when a full-size node receives a compression request from a client, it compresses transaction data from multiple blocks into a single data block, which would then be temporarily hosted on a different data storage system.
This data would then be run through a hash function with the data block hash value, and the compression transaction would map the relationship between the compressed block, the data block, and the compression event, which would all be recorded on the Blockchain.
While China has been one of the stricter countries globally in terms of cryptocurrency regulation, having banned Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and foreign exchanges from operating within the country, the South Korean Finance Minister spoke earlier this month of a need to cooperate with China in the sphere of Blockchain during a meeting with the governor of the Peoples Bank of China.

Bastareaud stars as France end winless streak against Italy
MARSEILLE, Friday: Mathieu Bastareaud celebrated his return to the France side following a three-week ban for a homophobic slur with a try in Fridays 34-17 Six Nations victory over Italy.
Missing the suspended tournament top try-scorer Teddy Thomas, France, who laboured for long periods before Italy typically crumbled late on, won for the first time in nine matches and 11 months.
Italy set their worst run in the competition of 15 straight defeats going back three years.
In what was billed the battle to avoid the wooden spoon after both sides had suffered two tournament defeats each so far, Bastareaud was key in creating one try and scoring another in an otherwise uninspiring affair that failed to light up a stadium more used to hosting football matches.
Tries from Paul Gabrillagues, Hugo Bonneval and Bastareaud proved enough for France as Maxime Machenaud kicked 17 points, although the hosts missed out on an attacking bonus.
Italy scored a penalty try and a late breakaway effort through Matteo Minozzi but too often found themselves dominated at the breakdown and forced into giving away cheap penalties.
Having conceded more than 100 points in their opening two matches, Italy captain Sergio Parisse had spoken on Thursday of the need to keep things tight early on and not give up easy scores.
But their resistance lasted just five minutes after giving away a penalty that France kicked to the corner before a driving maul was stopped short, only for Gabrillagues to scoop up the ball and stretch out his long arms to touch down.
Four minutes later, the Azzurri went straight up the other end, kicked a penalty to touch themselves and then drove over Maxime MBanda for an equalising score.
English referee Wayne Barnes called in the television match official as there was a doubt over whether the flanker had grounded the ball.
Barnes decided not but awarded Italy a penalty try anyway for France collapsing the maul and the visitors led 7-5.
On 29 minutes, Machenaud made up for his earlier conversion miss by giving France an 8-7 lead with a penalty.
Another Machenaud penalty on the stroke of half-time gave France an 11-7 lead in a poor half in which the fans seemed more interested in performing Mexican waves.
France scored within two minutes of the restart but after quick hands from Bastareaud sent Lionel Beauxis scampering into space, the fly-half wasted a three-man overlap with a poor pass that went to ground.
Under pressure in defence, though, Italy gave away a penalty right in front of the posts that Machenaud easily slotted over. - AFP

BOLLYWOOD MOURNS SRIDEVI
INDIA: Bollywood superstar Sridevi Kapoor, one of the biggest names in Hindi cinema, has died at age 54 after suffering a heart attack in Dubai, her former manager said on Sunday.
The death of Sridevi, reportedly while attending her nephew's wedding in the emirate late Saturday, prompted an outpouring of grief from fans and fellow actors and condolences from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
I have no words. Condolences to everyone who loved Sridevi. A dark day. RIP, tweeted actress Priyanka Chopra.
Hundreds started gathering outside Sridevi's home in Mumbai's Lokhandwala neighbourhood Sunday morning.
It is shocking and sad, her former manager Punkej Kharbanda told AFP. Her husband was with her at her death, he said.
Sridevi, born Shree Amma Yanger Ayappan in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, made her acting debut at the age of four and her career spanned more than four decades.
She worked in India's regional Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam-language films before making her Bollywood debut in 1979.
Sridevi made a name for herself with a string of blockbuster films including Chandni, Mr India, Mawali (Scoundrel) and Tohfa ( Gift).
Her first smash hit was the 1982 Tamil film Moondram Pirai and she played the same role in its Hindi remake, Sadma ( Trauma).
Her portrayal of a woman suffering from amnesia has been described by many critics as a milestone.
Kamal Haasan, her co-star in Sadma, paid tribute on Twitter.
Have witnessed Sridevi's life from an adolescent teenager to the magnificent lady she became. Her stardom was well deserved, Haasan tweeted.
Many happy moments with her flash through my mind including the last time I met her. Sadma's lullaby haunts me now. We'll miss her, he added.
The local police made arrangements to handle the swelling crowds outside Sridevi's home. Many were expected to wait till the family returns to Mumbai on Sunday afternoon with the body.
I came rushing here after reading news pertaining to Sridevi's death. She was our female Amitabh Bachchan (one of the biggest Bollywood stars) and I have watched all her movies, Vimal Khandakade told AFP.
I have always been a big fan and loved her performances... I will wait till her body is brought back and want to bid her farewell. Shoumik Mahapatra, 16, said he had grown up watching Sridevi's movies. She was so colourful and bold and I was always impressed by her character. I am very shocked by the news.
In an interview with The New Indian Express in 2013, Sridevi spoke of missing out on a carefree childhood when she began working as an actor.
I lost out on going to school and college life but I got into the film industry and worked without a gap -- from child actor I went straight to heroine. There was no time to think and I was grateful for it, she said.
In order to get something you have to lose something. You can't have everything in life. So I am happy with what I got. Sridevi was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian award, for her services to the film industry. She was especially admired for her ability to overcome language barriers and work in different regional film industries. Sridevi appeared in around 300 films and was set to see her older daughter Jhanvi make her Bollywood debut soon.
Social media and television channels carried hundreds of tributes.
Leading Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar expressedshock at her untimely demise.
A dream for many, had the good fortune of sharing screen space with her long ago and witnessed her continued grace over the years, Kumar tweeted.
Madhuri Dixit, whose fame rivalled Sridevi's, said the world has lost a very talented person who left behind a huge legacy in film.
Prime Minister Modi said he was saddened by the news. She was a veteran of the film industry, whose long career included diverse roles and memorable performances, Modi tweeted.
My thoughts are with her family and admirers in this hour of grief. Sridevi is survived by her husband, film producer Boney Kapoor, and their two daughters Jhanvi and Khushi.

Changes based on elections results, a common feature - President
Effecting changes and restructuring government policies and activities in keeping with election results is not peculiar to Sri Lanka but, a common feature in all countries in the world, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
We all accept the need to act according to the message received from the recent Local Government elections and implement a new programme of work with new ideas and proposals by effecting reforms and changes relating to government activities, the President said.
President Sirisena was addressing the new Ministers and State and Deputy Ministers at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday.
The President said the verdict of the people shows the need to correct our wrongs, remedy the shortcomings and introduce required political reforms by changing state policies and activities.
The Governments of our country as well as other countries make various decisions in keeping with the outcome of elections, President Sirisena said.
This instance shows the need to study the elections result and make the governments programme of work more attractive to the people. Accordingly, we need to effect changes in the Presidential Secretariat, Prime Ministers office, Ministries, government departments and institutions and streamline work performed through new projects, the President said.
We should make the necessary dedication for the sake of the country. The country and its people take priority in our policies. We all accept the need to perform functions for the benefit of the country and its people more expeditiously and effectively,he said.
We need to find out the causes for the election setback and correct them, the President added.
Todays Cabinet reshuffle deals with the Prime Ministers party only. Reshuffle of the UPFA section would definitely be effected within the next two weeks, the President added.
Similarly, changes should be made to drive efficiency into State Corporations and Statutory Boards. Correct guidance was vital for it. I also hope to take decisions and steps needed in this direction too,he added.
The President said he summoned Secretaries of Ministries last week and advised them to perform the duties of their institutions collectively in an efficient manner. The President said he would also request the newly appointed Ministers to summon progress review meetings of their Ministries and Institutions and drive efficiency into the services rendered to the people through annual allocation of funds.
The President said he would request them to expedite this work by convening meetings of District Development Committees and Regional Co-ordination Committees in their respective districts within this month.
It was in this manner that these institutions would become active. This would also help to complete various programmes on target, the President said.

China to drop presidential term limits, clearing way for Xi Jinping to stay on

China's Communist Party (CCP) has proposed amending the country's constitution to allow President Xi Jinping to serve a third term in office.
State-run news agency Xinhua said the Party will remove the provision that the President and Vice President "shall serve no more than two consecutive terms" from the constitution of the People's Republic of China.
The proposed amendment will have to be ratified by China's rubber-stamp parliament -- the National People's Congress (NPC) -- in March.
When it goes into effect, Xi will be free to serve indefinitely as China's head of state, the strongest indication yet he is intending to maintain power at the top beyond the two 5-year terms served by his predecessors for the past 20 years.
Break with tradition
Plans to change the country's constitutionfor the first time since 2004were announced in December, with most analysts predicting the Party would seek to modify the country's top legal document to createa National Supervision Commission (NSC), a country-wide anti-corruption task force with sweeping new powers.
In January, the Party's top body proposed alsoadding "Xi Jinping Thought" to the document, enshrining it alongside Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as a key guiding principle of the country.
Experts predicted last October that Xi may seek to stay on as leader afterhe failed to unveil an obvious successorat a major party congress, appearing to break with an unwritten rule of two five-year terms as head of the party.
However, some doubted whether this would require a constitutional change, saying Xi could simply retain power through his role as General Secretary of the CCP, which does not have term limits, rather than the ceremonial presidency.
Deng Xiaoping, the most powerful Chinese leader after Mao Zedong, gave up most of his official titles but retained a tight grip on the country until hisdeath in 1997.
By contrast, Xi's predecessor Hu Jintao was pushed out of his political roles and stripped of influence once Xi came to power. Since then he hasrarely taken partin public engagements and many of his allies have fallen to Xi's anti-corruption campaign.
Thomas Kellogg, executive director of Georgetown Law Asia, wrote last year that were Xi to follow the traditional 10-year term limit, "no doubt (he) could find a way to include himself in future high-flying global confabs, just as he could insert himself into key national meetings usually chaired by the Chinese president."
"But doing so would be made more difficult and create a potential rival in the form of the new president," he said. "Authoritarian rulers must constantly worry about whether their top lieutenants will seek to gain political advantage by betraying their own political patron, and Xi would be no exception."

China, India favour new security architecture
A presentation was made in Yangon Myanmar by Bernard Goonethilleke, Chairman Pathfinder Foundation, on The 21st Century Maritime Silk Road: Considering Security Implications sponsored by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES.
By now, a fairly large segment of the world population is aware of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), an important component of Chinas economic policy, with geo-political implications, which has been recently incorporated in to the constitution of the Chinese Communist Party.
Bernard Goonethilleke
A vast amount of funding has been earmarked for the project. New institutions such as the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the New Silk Road Fund have been created to provide resources for the project. The magnitude of the project could be determined by the estimate provided by the Asia Development Bank (ADB) that its 45-member countries, most of whom support BRI, would require US$ 22.6 trillion of infrastructure by 2030.
Understandably, a mega project of this nature would also attract detractors. The name, ancient Silk Road, harks back to history, when caravans connected the land route from Europe to China across Asia, and ancient mariners braved the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean ferrying merchants, mendicants and explorers. However, this time around, we are speaking of long distance diesel locomotives, mega-container-ships and ultra -large crude carriers (ULCC), massive industrial zones occupying thousands of acres and employing tens of thousands of workers. Massive projects of this nature would bring non-traditional security issues such as land rights, large scale migration, environmental degradation, scarcity of water resources, over exploitation of natural resources etc. to the fore. Drivers of BRI should not ignore these negative non-traditional security issues.
Against this backdrop we need to address security implications of the Maritime Silk Road (MSR), covering vast stretches of sea from the South China Sea to the Indian Ocean. Meanwhile the EU is keen to know how the Road would affect their interests, while across the Atlantic, the United States is cautious of the impact of BRI on its global interests. Meanwhile, India with large stretches of unsettled border with China and one of the spurs of the Belt known as C-PEC cutting through the disputed territory to reach Pakistans Gwadar port, has reacted negatively.
To assess the effects of the Road on the traditional security in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), the prevailing ground situation should be evaluated.
The broad deliverables under BRI have been published by Xinhua to coincide with the BRI Summit of May 2017. However, despite lack of clarity on the final architecture of BRI, the project has attracted a large number of countries in Asia, Africa and also some in Europe, representing 63% of the world population and 29% of global GDP.
China is poised to become the worlds leading economic power by about 2030, with India occupying 3rd position after the US. With growing economic interests, Chinas military strategy has undergone considerable transformation, as observed in the Chinas Military Strategy of 2015, which spoke of the need for safeguarding Chinas security and interests in new domains and security of Chinas overseas interests.
Jettisoning its earlier policy of non-establishing bases outside its national borders, Beijing has established a logistic base in Djibouti. Meanwhile, there is suspicion in certain quarters that China would establish similar facilities in the Indian Ocean, where Chinese companies have acquired controlling powers.
With military, naval and air force bases spread in many countries from the Gulf to the Philippines, the USA has been the hegemonic power in the Asia-pacific region. Consequently, the US is wary of China  a relatively new comer- moving in to the Indian Ocean - first to engage in anti-piracy work in the Horn of Africa and later establish naval facilities - notwithstanding the fact France, Japan and the US too enjoy similar facilities in Djibouti.
However, there are signs of waning military might and commitment of the US in the IOR, creating doubts as to how it would respond to security threats developing in the region. It appears, that the US expects India to shoulder some responsibility in addressing the situation, bearing in mind Chinas increasing naval power in the region, supported by Chinese owned or managed port facilities under BRI, would be a threat to Indias national security. It may be that, over a period of time, Washington expects New Delhi to take over the role of security guarantor in the region, which would not go unchallenged.
China is party to many security alliances, in which other countries such as India, Pakistan etc. play a role. The most recent is the formation of Quadrilateral Cooperation and Coordination Mechanism (QCCM) to counter terrorism and share intelligence in August 2016, by military leaders of Afghanistan, China, Pakistan and Tajikistan. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the eight- nation security alliance, in which both India and Pakistan are new members, is an important gathering. Meanwhile, the Asian Regional Forum (ARF) consisting of 27 countries and established to foster constructive dialogue and consultation on political and security issues in the Asia-pacific region, primarily serves the ASEAN, but includes other countries such as China, India, Pakistan Russia, the US and the EU. It is noteworthy that four of the seven South Asian countries take part in the ARF.
However, given the current political and security relations, formation of a security alliance among the SAARC countries is not a feasible exercise.
Would BRI help greater security cooperation or trigger further competition & mistrust
Taking in to consideration the current dynamics involving major players, it is conceivable that BRI would cause further competition rather than cooperation. Consequently, greater militarization of IOR will be on cards. India has made its position clear in a statement made to coincide with the BRI summit last May, highlighting its concerns, which sentiments were re-emphasized by Prime minister Modi in Astana, a month later.
In fact, BRI has already triggered some competition in the form of Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC) launched by India and Japan at the African Development Bank meeting, held in Gujarat 10 days after the BRI summit. Last week, India signed a US$85 million agreement with Iran to lease Shahid Beheshti Port at Chabahar, providing connectivity to Afghanistan and beyond.
This competition may not necessarily transform in to confrontation ending up with hostilities in the Indian Ocean involving countries in the region. However, both India and the US would be obliged to prevent China from establishing a foothold in the IOR on the back of MSR, and later turning the ports managed by them in to logistic supply facilities or bases for PLN. On the other hand, it is unlikely that countries in the region would knowingly and willingly subject their countries to such predicament.
Both China and India are in favour of a new security architecture as stated by respective political leaders. However, it is not clear how this architecture would be developed.
Chinas Policies on Asia-Pacific Security Cooperation released in January 2017 provides a glimpse of Chinese thinking on the subject, where reference is made to Chinas willingness to pursue security through dialogue and cooperation in the spirit of working together. Expert observation of the paper is, China seeks to bring countries in Southeast Asia to its orbit, away from reliance on the US for their security.
EU is keen to understand implications of the MSR and the security situation the Road would generate on the Union. With no fundamental issues against BRI, some EU countries have embraced the Chinese initiative with half of the 28 member EU associating themselves with the AIIB, a principal institution that would drive BRI financially.
It is hard to predict to what extent the EU would be affected due to the expanding Chinese influence in the IOR and the competition and possible confrontation that would follow. EU has no direct military involvement with the states in the IOR, at least in the traditional military sense. To a great extent positive or negative impact would depend on how the EU would develop its strategy in responding to the mega infrastructure project of China that would touch the lives of the people from the Strait of Malacca in the east to the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Aden in the west.

Reply to Cross Currents column by Jayatilleke de Silva
Subsidized pricing at taxpayers cost
I refer to the Cross Currents column by Jayatilleke de Silva where he refers to the pricing of agricultural products like vegetables and potatoes and points out that the cost of transport and storage facilities is a major debilitating factor.
But bringing the goods to where the consumer lives is an essential part of the cost of goods since they are produced to be sold. He also says the government's entry into the market for goods and services is essential.
Of course, no free market economist says the government should not participate in the economic activity but they say the government should do so on a level playing field and that the government should at least recover its costs in its pricing although a normal profit is also an essential requirement. What they oppose is subsidized pricing where the government makes a loss and passes it to the general taxpayer. The latter is unfair since the majority of taxpayers would not have benefited from the subsidized pricing of the government but only a minority who consume it. If it is consumed by the majority then the burden of subsidizing them falls on the general taxpayer and the poor are in the category of taxpayers when the cost of the tax is included in the pricing of the product.
Free market economists oppose government enterprise in free markets only when they subsidize and run deficits which are passed on to the general taxpayer who is not all consumers of the goods carrying the subsidy. The government then is practising an unfair practice although it may justify it in the case of essential goods consumed by the poor. But unless prices are free to vary in accordance with changes in costs, future production increases will be adversely affected.
A rising in the price gives a signal to the producer to produce more and if this signal is suppressed production may not increase with the increase in demand and the gap will continue and may even widen. There is a rationale for the free market if we want development through increased supply of goods and services. What is required is to ensure competition and where it is lacking the government should come in to resolve the problem even substituting itself as a supplier.

ComBanks gross income surges to Rs 115.6 bn
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC has posted profit before VAT and NBT of Rs 28.064 billion for the year ending December 31, 2017 reflecting growth of 18.14%, a performance the Bank attributes to substantial core business growth through adherence to the fundamentals of pure banking.
Gross income increased by a healthy 24.10% to Rs 115.594 billion, bolstered by interest income of Rs 103.034 billion, up Rs 22.296 billion or 27.62% primarily due to a significant growth in the Banks loan book over the 12 months.
Sri Lankas benchmark private bank paid approximately 41% of its profit to the government as taxes in a year of volatility and headwinds, but posted typically robust growth in all key performance indicators to end 2017 on steadfast note.
Profit before income tax grew by 15.62% to Rs 23.183 billion, the lower rate due to the impact on the full year of the November 2016 increase in the VAT rate from 11% to 15%.Profit after tax for the year improved by 14.25% to Rs 16.581 billion, the Bank reported in a filing with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
Commenting on these results, Commercial Bank Chairman Dharma Dheerasinghe said they demonstrate the Banks capacity to further financial inclusion within Sri Lanka and grow beyond the countrys shores both regionally and internationally, if additional tax burdens are not imposed.
He noted that the Bank paid out approximately 41% of its profits as taxes in addition to over Rs 2 billion it had collected from customers on behalf of the Government in 2017.
The Banks Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam pointed out that the growth of deposits and credit in the concluded year reflects the Banks strong capacity for financial intermediation, and illustrates a deployment of funding resources that is most conducive to the pursuit of productive assets.
Additionally, a further improvement in asset quality with both gross and net non-performing loans ratios decreasing, boosted profitability, Durairatnam said.Total assets of the Bank grew by Rs 131 billion or 12.96 % at a monthly average of Rs 11 billion to Rs 1.143 trillion as at December 31, 2017.
Net loans and receivables increased by Rs 121.428 billion or 19.71% over the 12 months of 2017 to stand at Rs 737.447 billion at the end of the year reviewed, recording an average increase of more than Rs 10 billion per month. This was the third successive time that Commercial Bank increased its loan book by more than Rs 100 billion in a year.
The Banks deposits portfolio witnessed a growth of 14.95% or Rs 110.564 billion to Rs 850.128 billion as at December 31,2017, reflecting average monthly growth of over Rs 9 billion. This was the second successive year in which the Banks deposits grew by more than Rs 100 billion.
In other performance indicators, the Bank improved net interest income by 18.89% to Rs 39.023 billion, more than double the rate of growth achieved in 2016, despite interest expenses growing by 33.59% to Rs 64.011 billion due to rising interest rates and a continuing shift of low cost funds to fixed deposits in 2017.
Net fees and commissions totalled Rs 8.602 billion for the year, reflecting growth of 22.62%. Other income comprising of exchange profit, recoveries and gains from trading of treasury bills and bonds declined to Rs 2.390 billion, mainly because the 2016 figure included translation gains due to a depreciation of the Rupee against the US dollar by 3.88% as against a 2.57% depreciation in 2017.
Consequently, total operating income grew by 13.41% to Rs 50.016 billion in the 12 months reviewed. Net operating income grew by 12.99% to Rs 48.102 billion, with total expenses increasing by just 6.49% to Rs 20.038 billion.
Total impairment charges for loans and other losses were increased by 25.13% to Rs 1.914 billion mainly due to the collective impairment provisions required on the growth of the loan book in 2017.
Shareholder funds grew by Rs 28.746 billion or 36.69%, consequent to the rights issue of shares, a reversal of mark to market gains on the Banks Available for Sale (AFS) portfolio due to a drop in rates in the market, and a once-in-three-years revaluation of the Banks land and buildings in line with accounting standards.
The Banks net assets value per share stood at Rs 107.54 at the end of the year, an increase of Rs 19.57 or 22.25% since December 2016. Return on assets after tax improved marginally to 1.54% while return on equity declined to 17.88% because the year-end shareholder funds base increased.
In terms of Capital Adequacy Ratios, the Banks Total Tier 1 capital ratio (with capital buffers) at 12.11% as at 31st December 2017 was well above the 7.75% required under Basel III. The Total Capital Ratio of 15.75% at the end of the year was also comfortably above the Basel III requirement of 11.75%.
At Group level, Commercial Bank, its subsidiaries and associates reported profit before income tax of Rs 23.280 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an improvement of 15.74%. Profit after tax for the year grew by 14.93% to Rs 16.627 billion.
Among the highlights of 2017 for Commercial Bank were its investments in digital banking and the performance of its overseas operations.
While the Banks Bangladesh operations performed characteristically well, its joint venture Bank in the Maldives broke even, opened a second branch on the island of Hulhumal and is now making a positive contribution to the Banks profitability.
In Myanmar, the Bank received a microfinance license in 2017 and formed a fully owned subsidiary, CBC Myanmar Microfinance Company Ltd., while in Italy, Commex Sri Lanka S.R.L., the Banks money transfer operation, increased its presence to eight cities besides Rome.
The only Sri Lankan bank to be ranked among the Top 1000 banks of the world for seven years consecutively, Commercial Bank operates a network of 261 branches and 756 ATMs in Sri Lanka.
The Bank has won more than 30 international and local awards in 2016 and 2017 and has over the years received multiple awards as Sri Lankas Best Bank, Best Trade Bank, Strongest Bank and Most Respected Bank from a number of local and international institutions and publications.

COMBANK conducts Math Camps for students
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon recently conducted Math Camps at three schools and donated Math Labs to fourmore schoolsunder the Banks Sustainable Math Lab Development project.
This has brought the total number of Maths Camps conducted by the bank during a two year period to 20, benefitting approximately 1,000 students.
Conducted with the aim of creating an affinity for the subject among students and to dispel the belief that math is a difficult subject, the Math Camps are conducted in the manner of a residential sports festival spanning three days, requiring the students to work in teams as well as to think individually, resulting in the development of their mathematical as well as their team skills.
This innovative concept allows the students to come to terms with their fear regarding mathematics in a setting that is outside the traditional classroom.This settling enables the students to sharpen their understanding skills, making it easier for them to further develop their analytical and logical thinking capabilities. The camps are conducted with the full involvement of the mathematics teachers of the schools and a panel of experienced mathematics teachers and former principals who possess extensive experience in coaching students.
The students who participated in the camps since 2016 have shown noteworthy progress in their math exam results, with some schools recording close to an 80% improvement, the Bank said. The Banks Math Lab initiative, which so far has benefitted over 5,000 students, was inspired by the results achieved by the Math Lab concept pioneered at the Miyenakandura government school, Passara, by former teacher and innovative learning materials designer H. A. Dharmasiri.
The CSR Trust of the Commercial Bank has also donated IT labs to 175 needy schools across Sri Lanka under one of its flagship community initiatives. The Trusts education-related community projects also include its involvement in the Smart Schools Project that has enabled digital learning in 65 schools in the Western province.
Commercial Banks overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 19 outlets, Myanmar, where it has a Representative Office in Yangon, the Maldives, where the Bank has a fully-fledged Tier I Bank with a majority stake and Italy, where the Bank operates its own money transfer service.

Cycles of history
Professor K M de Silva is one of the most renowned scholars of Sri Lankan history. His book, A History of Sri Lanka, published in 1981 and re-issued in 2005, is seen by many as the most comprehensive account of the islands history written to date. He is the author of political biographies of former Prime Minister D S Senanayake as well as J R Jayewardene, Sri Lankas first executive president. He holds a PhD from the University of London, and he founded the International Centre for Ethnic Studies.
Professor de Silva sat down with the Daily News at his office in Kandy last week to dissect the results of the recent local government elections from a historical perspective, as well as look to the future of Sri Lankan politics.
Q: As the local election results came in earlier this month, I was reminded of a line from your book. It reads: When the Sri Lankan electorate is in one of its not very infrequent moods of disenchantment with the regime in power, it gives vent to its displeasure with an exuberance and vehemence which all but obliterates the governing party. So Im wondering, how do you see the local elections in the context of Sri Lankan political history
Prof. K M de Silva
A: My attitude is somewhat different. We have pretended to be a rural society these last 75 or 80 years. But in fact the census reports show that we are a semi-urban society. And we havent done very much for these suburban people. So there has been a shift of focus, which these guys in local government dont understand. Youre going to have more attention being paid to the urban areas and suburban areas.
Youve noticed that theres rather unusual figure who has emerged as Mayor of Colombo: Rosy Senanayake. How she will manage in politics, I dont know, but I think she has the potential to be a very good mayor. She and some of the other younger people are likely to accept the fact that yes, we are suburban, and urban, so lets build on that. That is my interpretation of the recent elections, at least in Colombo.
But you have a lot of people that are disenchanted. You are seeing the Rajapaksas again  I used to call them a government of thieves. He is lucky that our courts take so long. We used to have a culture of law. If we ever return to it, it will be difficult for the politicians.
Q: Many people see Rosy Senanayake as standing for a progressive platform, and she did quite well in Colombo. But another powerful force in the urban area, as weve seen in places like Maharagama, are groups like the Bodu Bala Sena.
A: I wouldnt bother too much about it. They are not as powerful as the Buddhist movement of the recent past. If Venerable Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera is ever searched by the police, they will find lots and lots of money that he has got from unscrupulous businessmen who want his help in dealing with their rivals. So its not so bad.
Shall we put it this way We have to accommodate ourselves to the emergence of a new generation of politicians. Rosy Senanayake is one of them. But look at whats happened to the Bandaranaikes. Electorally, they have lost very badly this time. There is no hope of recovery unless you are willing to put up with the young people in your party who do not belong to your family. This they have not been able to do.
Q: Do you think a political dynasty like theirs is capable of change
A: No, the change has come. But they dont know it has come. The crucial electorate for Chandrika Kumaratunga is Attanagalla. They have lost it badly. They no longer have the sort of clout they had in those days. I would say this is all part of a period of change in which we are moving from rural Sri Lanka to suburban Sri Lanka.
Q: With the emergence of former President Mahinda Rajapaksas new party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, I was thinking about an example from history, that of E W Perera breaking from the Ceylon National Congress. He formed his own party, the All Ceylon Liberal League, which you say is a classic move for dissident and disgruntled politicians in Sri Lanka. But it did not last long. Do you see a similar fate for the SLPP
A: The All Ceylon Liberal League fizzled out quickly. They were opposed to things like the income tax, and poor old E W Perera fizzled out with it. I see a similar future for the SLPP.
The SLPP is headed by a man I know very well, Professor G L Peiris. He was an accomplished teacher of law. But you also must remember that his mother was an heiress to a huge fortune. He has never been guilty of throwing some of that money to charity or the poor. He is a very solid scholar. But theres not much that he can do unless hes willing to spend his money on some well-placed charities. People dont think of him like that. GL has never recovered from the privileged existence which he got from the time he was born.
So now, as far as the Prime Minister is concerned, if he knows what he wants, and works with the younger group of MPs, he should be okay. Because at least he doesnt have the disadvantages that Chandrika Bandaranaike has.
Q: What do you see as the important trends going into the Presidential and Parliamentary elections
A: I cannot predict anything. But I was one of the few who foresaw the fall of the Left in this country, which is something we are all grappling with now. Its a long time before another group comes up to take their place.
Theres a political space thats been left empty. The UNP has taken advantage of this, to a point. Lets look at the mathematics of it: if you get the Sinhalese Christians, the Muslims, and the Tamils together, they work out to something like 26 percent of the vote. If you have that, and youre sure you have it, you need very little more. The political arena has to accommodate these people.
Because that space will be filled, we dont know by whom. The Prime Minister can sit easy for a while, until somebody comes up to take advantage of that. We are going to have very interesting times ahead, until that vacuum is filled by some very dynamic young man or woman. For example, who could have predicted that Rosy Senanayake would be Mayor of Colombo
Q: One problem the current government has had, and which appears to have cost them in the local elections, is that they have not delivered many of the promises they made about reconciliation: releasing military-held land, giving information about missing people, and punishing criminals. It seems Tamil voters are extremely disenchanted with the promises they were given and how they feel theyve been broken. Can that coalition you speak of really be re-created
A: The history of Tamil grievances, specifically in the North, goes back much further than the war. Yes, they backed the LTTE, which was absolutely defeated. But the Kingdom of Jaffna, in the 17th century, was destroyed, obliterated, by the Portuguese. So theyve had in a few hundred years two whitewashes. So if you want reconciliation, you have to be more imaginative. And what about the tensions between the Muslim and Tamil communities No one looks at that problem, but it is a huge problem.
In the past, Tamil politicians backed the claims of the plantation workers and their children, and the Tamils who lived in the mountain areas. But there was a split. Now, when I speak with up-country Tamils, many say: Professor, we are Tamils, we are not hill country Tamils. So when they are talking about the Tamils they have to talk to us, too. The problems of the Tamils do not just exist on that little peninsula. These are problems that need to be addressed. Its going to be a fairly interesting situation for all the minorities, who form about 25 to 30 percent of the population.
The unity government seemed to recognize this in 2015. But I predict someone young will come up from the Tamils to face these issues.
Q: A force youve pointed to as influential in Sri Lankan history is the merging of Sinhalese traditionalism with radical ideologies from Europe. This fusion was apparent in the rhetoric leading to the 1848 rebellion, and even more apparent in the mass nationalism around 1956 and the passage of the Sinhala Only Act. How do you think these forces currently affect popular politics
A: This fusion is so significant, but people dont know it. Europe has had the same problems: after the Marxist movements have disappeared the nationalist fusions are still there. People need to stop and think about this.
I used to reflect on this, and I came to a conclusion. Once every 20-25 years, there is a radical change in Sri Lanka. When that happens, the government in power pays hugely: it happened in 1956, it happened in 1977. But it hasnt really happened since.
So its like this now. Theres a place called Dankotuwa, in Kurunegala. Its now producing porcelain of international quality. The head of this company is a Tamil Christian. He told me the area used to be known for what he calls Dankotuwa special, or pot arrack. But theyve moved on from that.
They know they cant compete with the Japanese, but they can do something similar. They employ many young women, and theyre well-paid and happy. These changes are possible.
So lets see how it goes. But I must say, I was not jolted by this recent election result.

Fresh hopes for a stable govt.
One would have thought that the sense of uncertainty that enveloped the country following the rift that developed within the Unity Government in the aftermath of the local government election results would by now have died down. The statements by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, in parliament, that the Unity Government arrangement between the UNP and SLFP will continue without interruption should have put paid to any lingering doubts in this regard. Yesterday's Cabinet reshuffle, too, should have reinforced the feeling that the parties had buried the hatchet, allowing the status quo to remain.
However there are still murmurings within the SLFP, that has created some form of ambiguity as to the fate of the Unity Government. Certain comments made by President Maithripala Sirisena have not helped in dispelling these doubts, adding to the state of confusion.
Meeting with a group of SLFP ministers, on Tuesday, President Sirisena has requested them one month's time to decide on a possible change in government, and, until such time to continue as a group. He has also told them that he had sought the opinion of the Supreme Court on the possible avenues available for a change of government and a change in the Premiership, and, until such time to proceed as a unit instead of taking arbitrary decisions.
This certainly is going to aggravate the sense of doubt and uncertainty that has been hanging over the country like a pall for the past two weeks. The President's remark, to the SLFP ministers, to give him one month to decide on the course he would be taking will mean that the country will remain in suspense for another one month. Already the rupee is taking a heavy beating vis-a-vis the dollar and the financial markets too have gone into a tailspin. Discussions in government offices today are centred on the fate of the Unity Government, and, talk in the market place too is focused on the current imbroglio. The state apparatus too has virtually ground to a standstill due to the prevailing uncertainty. State officials are reluctant to take decisions that they feel would compromise themselves. Even the law enforcement is in state of indecision going by reports of police inaction in the face of post election violence in certain areas. There is a general feeling of drift. Worse, foreign investors are bound to give a wide berth to the country, what with the stalemate to continue for another whole month.
Hence, it is extremely vital that the President makes a firm statement to the nation that would dispel the prevailing uncertainty and set the wheels of the state machinery, that is today stuttering on the brink of paralysis, set in motion once again, putting the country back on the rails. As the Head of State it is incumbent on him to send a clear message to all, particularly prospective investors, that all is well with his government.
The position with regard to the Prime Minister has been very clearly explained by constitutional lawyer and national list MP Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne, putting to rest any ambiguity. Premier Wickremesinghe, too, has informed the country about the constitutional position vis-a-vis his appointment. Hence, it is unfathomable as to why certain SLFP ministers still keep on insisting that the PM steps down. This, without the SLFP even having the required numbers in parliament to effect a change. Some SLFP ministers are also blaming the UNP's economic policies for the government's defeat. True, there had been lapses such as the poor implementation of the fertilizer subsidy programme, the high cost of living and the slashing of Samurdhi, which brought about a backlash in the rural areas.
However, those blaming the UNP's economic policies lose sight of the fact that the Premier's main focus was clearing the astronomical debt, the country is saddled with, which is a legacy of the Rajapaksas, and not pass on the burden to the next generation. This entailed certain cutbacks in the subsidies and increases in taxes that imposed hardships on the people, to some degree. Those blaming the Premier, therefore, had clearly failed to appreciate the larger picture envisioned in the UNP policies.
Be that as it may, yesterday's Cabinet reshuffle, hopefully, would herald a new beginning for the Unity Government, where it will continue unhindered, with all actors to the dispute ironing out their differences. It has two and half years more to complete its tenure, in terms of the mandate received from the people. Any attempt to scuttle the arrangement would only mean a betrayal of this mandate. The adverse results of the LG election, for the government, should not in anyway be an impediment to maintain the status quo. What is of paramount importance is to put up a united front, for the sake of stability. Bad mouthing each other in public should stop forthwith, lest this sends a wrong message, particularly to the foreign investors.
Above all President Sirisena should give a firm undertaking to the nation that the Unity Government will continue, as before, under his leadership. He should dispel all ambiguities in this regard.

The G-24 Bureau is the executive arm of the G-24 and consists of the Chair, First Vice-Chair, Second Vice-Chair, and two previous Chairs. Currently the Bureau is headed by Finance and Media Minister, Sri Lanka Mangala Samaraweera.
The G-24 Technical Group Meeting (TGM) serves as the main forum for discussing the key work programme priorities of the Group and preparing for the plenary meetings of Ministers and Deputies. The TGM is also a forum for peer learning, and sessions include discussions of country and regional experiences.
The 2018 TGM covers as its first theme debt management and sustainability. In this regard, the discussions will focus on key debt management and sustainability challenges faced, and strategies used by policymakers, both in terms of addressing macroeconomic linkages and improving liability management. The second and related theme will be mobilising external sources of capital in light of current, tightening global and market conditions.
This will involve sessions on the role of trade and investment agreements in boosting investment opportunities and the challenge of managing capital flow volatility, with a special session on the potential role of SDRs in improving the international monetary system. The discussions in the TGM will focus on the challenges faced by policymakers in these areas and the multilateral actions necessary to support domestic policy efforts.

Gone so soon!
Beauty lies in the eyes and we are all beholders. If it had not been for those wonderfully big and extremely expressive eyes, Sridevi would not have been half the star she is today. The actress who is also regarded as Bollywoods first female superstar is not only known being an actor par excellence but also as a dancer extraordinaire. She is possibly the only actress among her contemporaries to master a comic timing, a void she leaves behind which is impossible to fill.
The landmark actress died of a cardiac arrest in Dubai in the late hours of Saturday night while she was attending a family wedding. She was 54 at the time of her demise.
Hailing from the South Shree Amma Yanger Ayyapan, better known as Sridevis acting debut started at the age of four in M A Thirumughams Thunaivan. She contained as a child artiste Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada films before making her debut in Bollywood through Julie. Her first big break as a heroine came in 1976 when she starred in K Balachander`s milestone movie Moondru Mudichu opposite Kamal Haasan and Rajnikanth. Soon she made inroads into Telugu language movies by acting with all the top heroes in Tamil filmdom. Some of her most significant Tamil films are 16 Vayathinile (1977), Sigappu Rojakkal (1978), Varumayin Niram Sivappu (1980), Meendum Kokila (1981) , Premabhishekam (1981), Moondram Pirai (1982), Aakhari Poratam (1988), Jagadeka Veerudu Atiloka Sundari (1990) and Kshana Kshanam (1991).
Though it was 1983s Himmatwala which made her a inseparable part of Bollywood, her first adult role in a Hindi movie in 1978s Solva Sawan was unnoticed. Himmatwala even earned her the famous nickname Thunder Thighs due to doing a dance number wearing a short skirt. It also made Jeetendra and Sridevi a popular onscreen pair. The duo went on to star in several hits like `Tohfa`, `Mawaali` and `Justice Chaudhry`.
The critically acclaimed Sadma opposite Kamal Hasan brought her acting prowess to the limelight. Her performance in the film has often been cited by critics as the most definitive child-woman performance of Sridevis career.
Hits like Naya Kadam (1984), Maqsad (1984), Masterji (1985), Nagina (1986), Nazrana (1987), Mr. India (1987), Waqt Ki Awaz (1988), Chandni (1989), ChaalBaaz (1989), Lamhe (1991), Khuda Gawah (1992), Gumrah (1993), Laadla (1994) and Judaai (1997) made her a household name. Acting opposite many ace Bollywood actors, from Jeetendar to Rishi Kapoor, Mithun Chakraborty, Amitabh Bachchan, Anil Kapoor, and Sunny Deol she has also starred with Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar from the younger generation of actors. She has bagged five Filmfare Awards and has been nominated 10 times. In 2013, the Indian Government awarded Sridevi with the prestigious Padma Shri Award. She was also voted Indias Greatest Actress in 100 Years in a CNN-IBN national poll conducted in 2013 on the occasion of the Centenary of Indian Cinema.
It is known that Sridevi was offered a role in Jurassic Park by Steven Spielberg. She refused because it wasn`t a starring role and it would have meant taking a break from Bollywood, at a time, when she was at the peak of her career.
Though she had countless marriage proposals from wealthy Indians Sridevi married film producer Boney Kapoor in 1996. Boney happened to be the elder brother of actor Anil and Sanjay Kapoor. Their daughters, Jahnvi and Khushi, were named after the heroines of Boneys films Judaai (1997) and Hamara Dil Aapke Paas Hai (2000).
Surviving all odds the actress made a comeback to filmdom after a 15-year-long hiatus with Gauri Shindes 2012 hit English Vinglish. She has produced many of Boneys films like Shakthi (2002) too. Her last performance was seen in Mom which released in July 2017.
Many of Indias prominent figures have expressed their shock over Sridevis untimely demise. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stated that he is saddened by the untimely demise of the noted actor Sridevi. She was a veteran of the film industry, whose long career included diverse roles and memorable performances. My thoughts are with her family and admirers in this hour of grief. May her soul rest in peace.
Ive lost a dear friend and the industry has lost a true legend pens Superstar Rajinikanth while Kamal Hassan states Have witnessed Sridevis life from an adolescent teenager to the magnificent lady she became. Her stardom was well deserved. Many happy moments with her flash through my mind including the last time I met her. Sadmas lullaby haunts me now. Well miss her.
Hema Malini notes, Cant imagine how such a bubbly person, a wonderful actor, is no more while her contemporary Madhuri Dixit tweeted that the world has lost a very talented person who left behind a huge legacy in film.
Aamir Khan was deeply disturbed and saddened. He further added, I have always been a huge fan of her work. Equally I have always been an admirer of the grace and dignity with which she conducted herself Maam, we will always remember you with love and respect.
Juhi Chawla tweeted Ive always been such a fan of Sriji! How fragile is this life we take for granted!
Shocked, stunned. Still see her laughing talking. Unbelievable. Actor par excellence. A school in herself.. learnt so much from her. Still cant believe it. A huge loss, tweeted Kajol. Akshay Kumar states, A dream for many, had the good fortune of sharing screen space with her long ago and witnessed her continued grace over the years.
Jacqueline Fernandez tweets An absolute icon. Gone too soon, #Sridevi. Too soon...
Preity Zinta wrote Life is so fragile and unpredictable! You will always live in our hearts forever.
Kareena Kapoor called Sridevis passing heartbreaking while Anushka Sharma tweeted just cant believe its true... All my love and strength to the family. As gorgeous as an Angel and now amidst them.
Most significant performances
Sridevis sensuousness and beauty left many a film buff feeling misty. Here is a look back at the golden girls top dream performances.
Jaag Utha Insaan (1983)
Though it was Himmatwala that launched her into stardom in Bollywood it was this unsuccessful nugget of a film produced by Rakesh Roshan and directed by the inimitable K Vishwanath where Sridevi shone as a temple dancer wooed by a Brahmin boy Rakesh Roshan and a socio-economically challenged underdog Mithun Chakraborty
Sadma (1983)
The true coming of age of one of Indias finest actresses happed with Sadma. As a girl who after an accident regresses into childhood, Sridevi conveyed all the nuances of her characters predicament without getting over-cute. The performance is so accomplished and complete that it never ceases to astonish. Sridevis formidable co-star Kamal Haasan thinks she did the character even better in the Tamil original Moondram Pirai.
Nagina (1985)
What an impact! Sridevi as a snake-woman slithering on the floor dancing to Amrish Puris been music as Lata Mangeshkar sang the chartbuster Main Teri Dushman Dushman Tu Mera was unforgettable.
Jaanbaaz (1986)
It is strange how Sridevis legendary reputation is built on songs and dances as much as her breathtaking performances. In Feroz Khans Jaanbaaz, she had a brief role as Ferozs beloved. But her presence in the glowing orange chiffon sari dancing to the sound of Har Kisiki Nahin Milta, lingers.
Mr. India (1987)
Mr India marks a turning-point in Sridevis everlasting romance with the camera. Playing the perky Ms Journalist who hates kids Sridevi was just amazing. If Sridevis comic timing in the Charlie Chaplin impersonation sequence was impeccable, she oozed sensuality in that iconic blue chiffon saree in the song Kaate Nahin Kat Te.
Chandni (1989)
With this film Sridevi became what she was born to be.- a Yash Chopra heroine. Thinned down to a chiseled charmer, and sharpening her subtle emotive skills, Sridevi delivered a knock-out performance which straightway propelled her to the No.1 position. The film was an extended show-reel of her talent as she danced, sang, giggled and wept for the love of a tragically wheelchair-bound Rishi Kapoor. Seldom has any Yash Chopra heroine made such sumptuous use of the camera space.
Chaalbaaz (1989)
The same year as Chandni, Sridevi wowed movie buffs with her double role as the docile Anju and the tomboyish Manju. Though Dilip Kumar and Hema Malini had done the same double-role before Sridevi brought an added zest to the role. Pankaj Parasher let the actress have all the fun that she wanted.
Lamhe (1991)
Sridevi, as we all know, is addictive. After Chandni, Yash Chopra needed to work with her again. He brought her back to the screen in this bold love story of a girl who dares to love a man old enough to be her father. Sridevi played both the mother and the daughter with such distinctive flair that it is a wonder that the same actress do so many different spectrums of emotion in the same film.
Army (1996)
In this, the only film that brought Sridevi face to face with Shah Rukh Khan, there is a sequence where Shah Rukh playing an army officer is brought home dead. All through the film, Shah Rukh plays I-am-dead pranks on Sridevi, so she presumes this is also one of those sick jokes. The way she goes from giggling dismissal to shock and finally a breakdown in that sequence is a textbook of pitch-perfect acting.
Judaai (1996)
Her last hurrah before she bowed out to play wife and mother Judaai is a melodrama directed by the late Raj Kanwar. It features Sridevi at her absolute best. The way she lifts some mundane scenes has to be seen to be believed.
English Vinglish (2012)
English Vinglish is considered as her comeback film. It proved once again there will never be another Sridevi.

Good taboo in fiction
Its easy to sneer at the Literary Reviews Bad Sex in Fiction Award  sneering at the sneerers, as it were  but its no lie that writing well about sex is difficult, and perhaps more difficult in prose than in poetry. I think there are three main reasons for this. Firstly, the vocabulary: the words for human genitalia, when they arent puerile or bluntly medical, are semantically loaded with enough sexual-political freight to capsize any sentence. Secondly, the activity itself: however pleasant it may feel to those involved, most variations of the sexual act are pretty obviously open to ridicule. The third reason relates to those feelings. The brain may be the largest sexual organ, but orgasm switches important parts of it off. We barely know ourselves when having sex; how should we be expected to write it
Nevertheless, good sex writing does exist  and here, sticking to the parameters of the award, I essentially mean the sex scene in the literary novel or short story, ignoring outright pornography or its kissing cousin, erotica. Which is not to say the scene should not be arousing, but its primary object should be to serve the story. The writing should teach us about the characters. Ideally, it should teach us about sex, too.
Physical descriptions
One recent novel that would surely be nominated for a Good Sex in Fiction Award, if such a thing existed, is Eimear McBrides The Lesser Bohemians (2016). McBrides book, about an Irish drama student who has a relationship with an older British actor, refuses to recognize a barrier between what might be termed sex acts and any other part of the characters interaction  and further buries the physical descriptions in McBrides distinctive prose style:
Bit harder he wonders. I. I. But the mouth on my breasts then  tickle and strange delight of being seen  surprises me, if not to everything, to something. Like first foot inveigle toward what this could be. With the look in his eye. With his body in me. Going and going and harder until Oh fuck, he says Hold still, Im way too close, any chance you are
This reminds me of, firstly, Niall Griffithss intense novel about a sado-masochistic relationship, Kelly + Victor (2002) and, further back, James Salters A Sport and a Pastime (1967). Salters novel of a young expat Americans affair with a French shopgirl in provincial Autun is a frequent reference point for good sex writing. Much of its lyricism comes from the fact that the details of the affair are imagined by the narrator, who seems as much in love with the relentlessly debonair Philip as he is with Anne-Marie. Here they are, in a typical bedroom scene:
With a touch like flowers, she is gently tracing the base of his cock, driven by now all the way into her, touching his balls, and beginning to writhe slowly beneath him in a sort of obedient rebellion while in his own dream he rises a little and defines the moist rim of her cunt with his fingers, and as he does, he comes like a bull.
Like a bull is a false step, to be sure, but this contrast between unabashed, precise physical description and more unexpected, imaginative leaps is characteristic of Salters approach to the subject. The image of the bull pales next to another animal simile in Salters last novel, All That Is (2013). In it he describes a man as coming like a drinking horse, so falling foul of Gibbss Law of Reversible Similes: if you can describe something as being like something else, then that comparison should work equally well in reverse. I am yet to see a horse drink like a man coming, and hope I never will.
Self-deprecation
You can see a lot of Salter in the sexual adventures of Geoff Dyers novelistic heroes, who for all their frustrations and self-deprecation have immensely enviable sex lives. In Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi (2009), the titular freelance journalist and the woman of his dreams have barely met at the Venice Biennale before they are having sex.
He licked down her stomach and then moved lower so that he could smell and see her. She reached down to hold her underwear aside.
He stayed there motionless, inhaling deeply through his nose, exhaling through his open mouth. Only his breath touched her. Neither of them moved.
He tilted his head and she moved from the edge of the desk, bending her legs slightly until she was almost touching his tongue and then was.
She kissed his face with her cunt, moving over his mouth, moving in synch with him.

How to grow a powerhouse
In 2012, I got a text that Jennifer Eganfresh off her Pulitzer winwas reading at Valencia Community College in Orlando. I was thrilled until I found out the reading was already in progress. The text came from a professor friend who was on campus by chance and had just found out about the reading himself.
These gigs almost always go a certain way: a stretched-thin professor wrenches money from the budget for an author to read under harsh classroom lights (the acquisition of said classroom its own logistical nightmare) to a handful of students on a random weekday afternoon. The students are enriched, but the larger literary community is excluded. This divide between academia and the general public inspired me to start Functionally Literate: a literary function that same year with writer Jared Silvia.
Local events
We had a few things going for us already: Orlando is a small pond where its easier to make a splash; the series is part of Burrow Press, which had been building a following through local events and publishing projects; and Orlando has a hungry lit community outside academia.
As we planned the series, we created some parameters. We hold events quarterly and invite national authors, because there are plenty of existing monthly series focused on locals. Then we pair a local with each visiting author to spotlight Orlandos talent and introduce established writers to rising stars. We schedule events for Saturday nights to accommodate students and working stiffs, then add a stage, lighting, and music to remove all traces of academia. And we bookend the program with drinking and mingling to give attendees a chance to bond.
After five years and twenty-one functions, with an average attendance of 100 peopleand as many as 250 for bestsellers like Lauren Groff and Jeff VanderMeerIve come to believe that any success should be attributed, banal as it sounds, to community. While defining communities can be problematic, we decided to be nave and think of our audience as everyone in Central Florida who enjoys literature.
Valuable resource
We invited our professor friends to the table from the get-go, convincing them theyd enjoy the series and that it would be a valuable resource for their students. Professors are some of the best writers weve got and an integral part of the larger community, so its not uncommon to see them attending and reading at our events. Professors have even counted attendance as extra credit and set visiting authors up with small classroom gigs to help cover hotels and other expenses.
It was through community connections with a Rollins Colleges radio station, WPRK, that Jared and I finagled Functionally Literate Radio, a weekly FM vehicle for interviewing writers and promoting literary events, including our own. Being aware, supportive, and respectful of other events in town is good literary karma. It also helps avoid double-booking and thinning your audience. Rollins College, for example, brings a world-class writer to town each week in February, so we dont plan any functions then in deference to the awesomeness of that month. As it happened, Rollins approached us last year to collaborate on a function featuring Lisa Lucas, the Executive Director of the National Book Foundation.
In our efforts to avoid an academic vibe and draw a wider audience, weve held functions at a variety of arts spaces, including the Orlando Museum of Art, the Gallery at Avalon Island, the Fringe Festival, the Timucua Arts White House, Blue Bamboo Center for the Arts, and the Lowndes Shakespeare Center, as well as warehouses. This nomadic strategy has garnered new audiences who hadnt heard of us but frequent these venues, and spaces weve worked with have been generous because they see literature as part of the bigger arts picture.
Drunken Odyssey
We also collaborate with the non-academic lit community: Bookmark It is our longtime indie bookseller partner; The Drunken Odyssey with John King podcast re-airs our functions; as a member of the Kerouac Project board, I plug their residency program at events and occasionally invite residents to read; and weve partnered with the LGBT newspaper Watermark for a function featuring LGBT writers and with the Writers Atelier writing center for our first YA-focused function.
Our outreach extends to that elusive community of readers-who-do-not-write. Theres nothing more thrilling than having a stranger tell you theyre at your event with their book club. To find these folks who we might never meet at an art event, we utilize the media. Weve developed good relationships with arts editors at our local alt weekly, the Orlando Sentinel, and the local NPR affiliate, WMFE, to make sure they get galleys and have a good angle to work with. We blast local blogs and niche media with press releases, but send personalized pitches to outlets most likely to cover the event.
We list events on every conceivable digital calendar, including Yelp (the Orlando chapter is a community partner of ours, which means they feature our events in their massive e-blasts), but press releases are key. After cranking out some hideous ones, Ive learned to tell the story behind the event (a listing of details isnt enough). Marketing is uncomfortable territory for me, but bringing more people out to buy books by a writer you admire is a noble cause, and when you believe in an author the press release ends up being honest.

IgniterSpace celebrates two years of social impact with three accolades
When software engineer Hasith Yaggahavita founded IgniterSpace, together with two colleagues, he was simply making up for the lack of a good creative education- or more specifically, makerspace- programmes to enrol his own kids in.
In March 2016 IgniterSpace began its journey in Hasiths home. Two years later Hasith and his team celebrated a rapid expansion and a couple of unexpected, yet well-deserved wins at the e-Swabhimani awards 2017 and Venture Engine 2017.
IgniterSpace is a makerspace for kids that guides them to unleash their creativity through technology. Although not a phrase used in common parlance, a makerspace is simply a place where students can gather to create, invent and tinker using tools, material and some guidance.
The company quickly grew from being a small operation at Hasiths home to a very popular educational institute coveted by parents who wanted their kids to have the IgniterSpace experience. Mano Sekaram, Hasiths long-time mentor and eminent IT industry heavyweight, joined in to help IgniterSpace grow.
Today the IgniterSpace team consists of 15 full time professionals and 45 part-time instructors led by CEO Jehan Wijesinghe and COO Buddika Wijesekera. Their educational model is a tried, tested and loved by kids. Students begin with prototyping known machines to develop basic knowledge as well as fine motor skills and then move onto production grade explorative creations.
This is where the steps for innovation and entrepreneurship are laid, says CEO Jehan Wijesinghe. We are committed to guiding the younger generation to become innovators and creators of technology, but we also understand that this is not a vision that is accomplished over a short span of time. Were ready to walk the talk with our partners over decades to come.
The team is also celebrating placing winners in the education category at the 2017 national e-Swabhimani awards presented by the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA). IgniterSpace also received the Aaavishkaar Social Impact Award for the highest social impact and was the 1st runner up at Venture Engine 2017.
The classes are conducted at five levels: first 3 levels are for age based entry (ages 5-7 years, 8-10 years, 11-15 years) and prerequisite for level 4, which is focused on problem solving. Once level 4 is completed, students can enter the IgniterSpace Start-up School where they learn to become real-world innovators and entrepreneurs. The courses are usually conducted in English, although native languages are accommodated on request.

India finish tour in triumph as South Africa fall short
CAPE TOWN, Saturday: India finished their tour of South Africa in triumph when they won the third Twenty20 international by seven runs at Newlands on Saturday.
India clinched the series 2-1 to complete a white ball double following a 5-1 victory in a one-day international series.
Indias win was achieved despite the absence of inspirational captain Virat Kohli, who did not play because of a stiff back.
Stand-in captain Rohit Sharma said India had not allowed themselves to lose focus after losing the first two Tests before hitting back by winning the third Test and going on to dominate the limited-overs matches.India finish tour in triumph
We showed a lot of intensity and played with a lot of aggression. We never backed down in any situation, said Sharma.
Although South Africa got close to chasing down Indias 172 for seven, they were unable to recover fully after a slow start. South African captain JP Duminy identified the opening six powerplay overs as the the crucial difference between the teams. India were 57 for one after six overs, South Africa struggled to 25 for one.
They bowled pretty well in the Powerplay, said Duminy. We just couldnt get the boundaries and we couldnt get the singles either. Credit to India, they had an outstanding white-ball tour.
Duminy made 55 off 41 balls and new cap Christiaan Jonker slammed 49 off 24 balls before being caught off the last ball of the match. It got the hosts close but they never really threatened to reach the target.
Indian opening bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who was named man of the series, again bowled outstandingly in the first six overs, delivering an opening spell of one for 13 in three overs.
Kumar came back to bowl the final over, with South Africa needing 19 runs to win and gave away only 11 runs before having Jonker caught at cover by Sharma. South Africa finished with 165 for six.
South African fast bowler Junior Dala took three wickets and made a direct-hit run-out to keep Indias batting in check. Dala took three for 35 and ran out top-scorer Shikhar Dhawan for 47 with a direct hit from the midwicket boundary.
India lost Sharma to Dala in the second over but looked set for a big score when Suresh Raina went on the attack in a second wicket stand of 65 with Dhawan.
Raina hit 43 off 27 balls before he was caught at long-on off left-arm spinner Tabraiz Shamsi.
Dhawan was more subdued. He was dropped twice and did not hit a boundary until the 12th over. Just when he seemed to be finding his timing, with two more boundaries, he was run out. None of the remaining batsmen could make more than Hardik Pandyas 21.

Ireland maintain perfect start in wild 37-27 win over Wales
DUBLIN, Saturday - Ireland maintained their perfect Six Nations start on Saturday but were made to sweat for it in a frantic 37-27 victory over Wales that put them clear at the top of the championship and on track for a potential grand slam.
Trailing by eight points at one stage in a first half they otherwise utterly dominated, Ireland led by two scores midway through the second before weathering a Welsh comeback stopped in its tracks by an intercepted Jacob Stockdale try at the death.
After starting the tournament hampered by injuries, Wales welcomed back three British and Irish Lions while Ireland lost three of their own. However, it was the hosts who were left to rue a wasteful opening 20 minutes.
Johnny Sexton uncharacteristically missed three early kicks at goal, the first a simple chance to trade early penalties with Leigh Halfpenny, although he made up for it with a pinpoint, long skip pass that sent Stockdale in for the opening try. The Ireland flyhalf failed to land the conversion and missed another straightforward penalty, the third Wales conceded inside the first 13 minutes having given away just two in the entirety of their defeat to England.
Ireland were also lacking discipline and giving away turnovers, the second in a matter of minutes allowing Gareth Davies to sprint in and Halfpenny, having far fewer issues with his boot, soon extended the advantage to eight points.
However Ireland quickly regrouped, first handing Sexton a chance to finally get on the board before pummelling the Welsh defence for Bundee Aki to score and end a wild half in which they turned 76 percent of possession into just a two-point lead.
Joe Schmidts side were intent not to make the same mistake twice and looked like they might have put the game out of sight inside the first 13 minutes of the second half.
Their ability to effortlessly change the point of attack was dizzying for the visitors defence as smart breaks from Keith Earls and Rob Kearney, followed by more intense forward pressure put flanker Dan Leavy in for his first Six Nations try.
Firmly camped inside the Welsh half, it was only a matter of time before the bonus point try came and prop Cian Healy duly obliged.
But Wales were not done and a converted Aaron Shingler try - their first sniff at the Irish line in the second period - cut the deficit to a one-score game.
Ireland scrumhalf Conor Murray, taking over kicking duties from a limping Sexton, appeared to have settled it again with a penalty five minutes from time but another try from Steff Evans frayed some Irish nerves, settled by Stockdales interception.
After Scotland beat England in Saturdays late game, Ireland are five points ahead of the English and six clear of the Scots, both of whom they face in their final two games.

Kandy retains Clifford Cup
Rugby legend Fazil Marija hung up his boots yesterday ending a 15-year legendary playing career as Kandy SC scored a superb 21points (3 tries, 2 penalties) to 7 (1 try, 1 conversion) win over Navy Sports Club in their Dialog A Division Clifford Cup knock out Rugby tournament finals played at CR & FC grounds in Longden Place, thus winning the Clifford Cup. Kandy were leading 8-nil at the breather.
Kandy SC skipper, Gayan Weerarathne, receiving the Dialog Rugby Clifford Cup champions trophy from Amali Nanayakkara - Group Chief Marketing Officer, Dialog Axiata PLC.
It was Kandys three quarters who paved the way for this victory. Especially Fazil Marija gave a terrific display to outplay their famed counterparts.
Navy were let down by their three quarters who delayed their passes which saw them being nailed over and over by their opposite numbers and also knocked on at crucial moments which resulted in their speedy wingers Chathura Gomez and Buddima Piyaratne being kept in cold storage. But on the few occasions they got possession both made some threatening runs before they were brought down in the nick of time by the vigilant Kandy defence.
The Kandy outfit went in to a 5 nil lead in the 3rd minute of play when centre Danushka Ranjan touched down for a try which full back Nigel Ratwatte fluffed the conversion.
In the 33rd minute Kandy increased their lead to 8-nil when Ratwatte slotted in a simple penalty.
They went into the half time leading 8-nil.
After the breather Navy SC cut down the lead in the 42nd minute when fly half Mohamed Abzal ripped off the ball from Marija and scored under the post after a 40 metre dash. Full back Thilina Weerasinghe put over the conversion to reduce the gap 8-7 in favour of Kandy.
In the 59th minute Kandy SC surged into a 13-7 lead when Ranjan scored his second try of the match. Full back Thilina Wijesinghe missed the conversion.
Soon after Kandy scored again in the 62nd minute of play when Wijesinghe fired across a 30 metre penalty to increase the score to 16-7. Kandy SC sealed the game in the 65th minute when flanker Shehan Lema Pathirana scored a try off a spectacular cross kick by Marija. Wijesinghe missed the conversion but Kandy Sports Club ran out worthy winners, beating Navy by 21 points to 7.

India captain Virat Kohli was yesterday presented with the prestigious ICC Test Championship Mace as his team retained the top spot in the MRF Tyres ICC Test Team Rankings.
On behalf of the ICC, the mace was presented by ICC Cricket Hall of Famers Sunil Gavaskar and Graeme Pollock at a ceremony in Cape Town at the conclusion of Indias tour of South Africa.
India ensured the number one spot on the MRF Tyres ICC Test Team Rankings and a prize of $ 1 million after their victory in the Johannesburg Test against South Africa last month ensured that no team can move ahead of them in the Test rankings at the 3 April cut-off date.
India won the prize for a second year running and have now been at the top of the rankings since October 2016. They have also been at the top two times before under Kohli  in January-February 2016 and in August 2016. Indias longest stint at the number-one position was from November 2009 to August 2011, when Mahendra Singh Dhoni was the captain.
The other captains to have received the mace are Steve Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke, Steve Smith (all Australia), Andrew Strauss (England), Graeme Smith, Hashim Amla (both South Africa) and Misbah-ul-Haq (Pakistan).
India captain Virat Kohli: Its truly a great feeling to hold the ICC Test Championship mace again, which is an acknowledgement of our success in the truest format of the game.
Were proud of the way we have performed in Test matches over the past couple of years and our performances have reflected in the rankings.
The quality of a side is judged in the way players step up when needed, and that is what our boys have done time and again.

The Power & Energy Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 6.95% (or LKR 0.30Bn) to the market driven by Resus Energy which accounted for 92.61% of the sector turnover.
Liquidity (in volume terms)
The Banks, Finance & Insurance sector dominated the market in terms of share volume, accounting for 55.27% (or 104.60Mn shares) of total volume, with a value contribution of LKR 2.32Bn.
The Diversified Sector followed suit, adding 9.85% to total turnover volume as 18.64Mn shares were exchanged.
The sectors volume accounted for LKR0.77Bn of total market turnover value. The Telecom Sector meanwhile, contributed 14.22Mn shares (or 7.51%), amounting to LKR0.19Bn.
Top gainers and losers
York Arcade was the weeks highest price gainer; increasing 821.4% W-o-W from LKR 14.00 to LKR 129.00. Swarnamahal Finance gained 37.5% W-o-W to close at LKR2.20.Tal Lanka (+19.9% W-o-W) and Trade Finance (+18.3% W-o-W) were also amongst the gainers.
PC Pharma was the weeks highest price loser, declining 50.0% W-o-W to close at LKR0.10 while Adam Investments (-33.3% W-o-W), SMB Leasing [NV] (-33.3% W-o-W), Blue Diamonds [NV](-20.0% W-o-W) were also amongst the top losers over the week.
Foreign investors closed the week in a net buying position with total net inflows amounting to LKR 0.91Bn relative to last weeks total net inflow of LKR 0.49Bn (+84.0% W-o-W).
Total foreign purchases increased by 80.5% W-o-W to LKR 1.90Bn from last weeks value of LKR 1.05Bn, while total foreign sales amounted to LKR 0.99Bn relative to LKR 0.56Bn recorded last week (-77.38% W-o-W).
In terms of volume Commercial Bank & Softlogic Holdings led foreign purchases while Distilleries & Raigam Salterns led foreign sales.
In terms of value Commercial Bank & Softlogic Holdings led foreign purchases while Distilleries & HNB led foreign sales.
Point of view
Political uncertainty over the future of the coalition government continued to cloud investor sentiment this week, with equity markets moving sideways as the benchmark ASPI moved up just 4 points to consolidate at the 6570 level.
Turnover levels however, improved 21% W-o-W to Rs. 0.87Bn, back in line with the YTD average of Rs. 0.86Bn and in contrast to the Rs.0.72Bn recorded last week.
Turnover levels were aided largely by the return of the Institutional and HNI investors who accounted for 32% of market activity this week, cf. the previous 3-weeks when they accounted for just 25% of market activity.
Positive macro-data in the form of lower national inflation levels in January and a stronger external position in December along with relatively robust corporate earnings stoked investor appetite for risky assets.
Of the 85% of corporates who have reported earnings thus far (total earnings of Rs. 65Bn cf. Rs. 75Bn for all companies in Dec16), 51% have recorded Y-o-Y gains in earnings.
Meanwhile, after a slight dip in their appetite for risky domestic assets in the immediate aftermath of the LG polls last week, foreign investors returned quite strongly back to equity markets this week, pumping in a net of Rs.908Mn (+84% WoW) to the Colombo bourse cf. last week when net foreign inflows declined 32% Wow to Rs. 493Mn.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from the conclusion of the corporate earnings season.
Sri Lanka records second highest BoP surplus in 2017
Sri Lankas Balance-of-Payments (B-o-P) position in 2017 recorded a surplus for the 1st time in 2 years amid consistent improvements in the countrys external sector throughout the year.
Relative to the deficit of $0.5Bn in 2016 and deficit of $1.5Bn in 2015, the B-o-P surplus in 2017 was $2.1Bn, the countrys 2nd highest surplus since 2009 when it recorded an overall balance of $2.7Bn.
The surplus position was driven primarily by consistent financial flows over the year as robust financial flows to debt ($1.7Bn cf. $1.2Bn in 2016) and equity markets ($279Mn cf. $19Mn in 2016) along with higher FDIs ($766Mn cf. $397Mn), receipt of the IMF EFF tranches ($419Mn) and proceeds from ISB issuances ($1.5Bn) aided overall capital inflows.
Earnings from exports over December meanwhile surpassed $1Bn mark for the 5th consecutive time this year, helping the cumulative export earnings for 2017 hit a historically high value of $11.4Bn.
Despite the stronger export performance however, the cumulative trade deficit for 2017 rose to $9.6Bn (cf. $8.9Bn in 2016), reflecting higher import expenditure due to weather-related factors.
Import expenditure in 2017 rose to a historical high of $21Bn largely due to the drought-induced need for fuel and rice imports. Nevertheless, the marginal improvement in tourist earnings ($3.6Bn cf. $3.5Bn in 2016) and largely steady workers remittances ($7.2Bn) helped curb the trade deficit to an extent.

Mexican Presidents visit to U.S. shelved over wall
US: Mexico and the United States have shelved tentative plans for a visit to Washington by President Enrique Pena Nieto as tensions persist over a proposed border wall, US media reported on Saturday.
Pena Nieto had already cancelled a visit in January last year because of US President Donald Trumps insistence that Mexico pay for the wall, which he wants as part of his efforts to curb immigration.
The White House had said in mid-February that the two presidents were working on arranging a meeting.
But The Washington Post, which first reported cancellation of the provisional meeting, said both countries agreed to call it off after a testy telephone call ended in an impasse over the border barrier.
The phone call took place last Tuesday.
Citing US and Mexican officials, the Post said Trump would not agree to publicly affirm Mexicos position that it would not fund construction of a border wall that the Mexican people widely consider offensive.
Pena Nietos visit had been considered for February or March, the Post said, but the Mexican leader wanted to avoid public embarrassment.
Building the border wall was a primary pledge of the 2016 presidential campaign by Trump, who says the barrier is necessary for his countrys security.
Asked about the reports, a Mexican presidential source told AFP there would be no comment.
Theres nothing additional to the last Tuesday statement, the source said, referring to comments after the phone call.
Both countries said at the time that they agreed in their call to boost cooperation on security, trade and migration.
In addition to disagreement over the wall, Trumps attacks on Mexican immigrants and threats to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement have strained relations between the neighbors.
The leaders did meet once, on the sidelines of the G20 summit of major economies in Hamburg, Germany, last July.
Mexico goes to the polls this July as Pena Nieto approaches the end of his term, with his Institutional Revolutionary Party deeply unpopular. - AFP

New App for heritage sites in Sri Lanka
YuSit is a French company specializing in cultural heritage enhancement. By developing innovative mediation tools for cultural sites all over the world, they help the local entities to make the best use of the richness of their heritage, in order to fulfill the wishes and needs of both foreign and local visitors. Daily News spoke to Managing Directress of YuSit, Claire Delalande who elaborated more on YuSit and its involvement with Sri Lanka.
In the course of our projects in Asia, we chose Sri Lanka to develop an innovative cultural heritage project, in collaboration with local stakeholders engaged in culture and tourism. In collaboration with Galle Heritage Foundation and the Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development, we have developed a visitor assistant mobile application for Galle Fort in Sinhala, English and French. The application is equipped with geo-fencing technology which enables visitors to get notifications of attractions with descriptions nearby while strolling in Galle Fort. Even if visitors do not wish to use geo-location, they can still read the descriptions of the attractions.
In the application, they will find particularly Practical information, Etiquette for visiting religious places, history of the city and 19 points of attractions. The application does not collect any personal data and is free of charge for anyone. Once downloaded, it can be used offline with all its features, said Claire Delalande.
YuSit is based in France, in the suburbs of Rouen, in Normandy region, to the northwest of Paris. The company was founded in 2015.
Being a company comprising of archaeologists, historians, and computer engineers, the team members are also involved in research programs, scientific commissions, UNESCO and participate in the training of new generations of cultural professionals by teaching at the university and taking part in symposiums and special seminars reserved for specialists. With 20 years of experiences in cultural heritage valorization in France and abroad, they develop and coordinate all types of cultural projects.
We are developing many projects in Europe and Asia, like digital platforms for museums and natural sites in France and Philippines, mobile applications for several historical sites in Sri Lanka like Sigiriya, in Thailand and in France. In order to fully understand each context and to work intelligently with the cultural structures of each country in which we operate, our team integrates at least one local stakeholder for each project. Whether he is an expert, a student or a site manager, he is an indispensable person in the development of projects that are truly adapted to local populations and carried out with a view to opening up to foreign tourists. It is because heritage and cultural projects are bridges between people and open up to the world that we develop a collaborative approach based on the exchange of experiences, explained Claire Delalande.
E-culture is a growing discipline in Digital Humanities. Digital tools are becoming an integral element of the cultural communication. Smart phone applications for heritage sites, virtual reconstructions of monuments created with augmented reality and virtual reality have rejuvenated the cultural mediation.
The new technology contributes to make heritage understandable to the public. Today, many e-heritage projects across the world have successfully gained attention of both young and old visitors.
First, we would like to finish the projects we are developing. Then, we would like to shape new projects in Sri Lanka and all over the world. We will continue to advise stakeholders in the use of new technologies for the enhancement of heritage sites, while highlighting our values, particularly cultural democratization. Our app for Galle Fort has been released on January 30 2018 under the name Visit Galle. We invite all Sri Lankans to experience this new e-heritage app for free.
It is now available on Google Play. The Ios version of the application will be released very soon on AppStore! said Claire Delalande.Some local travel agencies have also joined this cultural project as communication partners. They are - Yathra Travels, Sanchaara, Authenticities, Nature Heights and Okithma Travels.

`Old at just 25
The human brain becomes old at just 25, new research suggests. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is found in the brain and spinal cord, changes its speed of movement in people older than mid-20s, a study found.
These movements are linked to breathing and heart rates, with CSF changes previously being associated with conditions such as multiple sclerosis and high blood pressure. Study author Professor Aneta Stefanovska from Lancaster University said: Preliminary results showed evidence of a decline in participants over the age of 25, indicating that brain ageing may begin earlier than expected.
Future studies could provide further insights into various neurodegenerative and ageing-related diseases.
It is unclear if these CSF changes are associated with brain disorders that typically affect the elderly, such as dementia. Previous research suggests the volume and weight of the brain begins to decline by around five per cent per decade when a person reaches 40 years old.
Findings may improve diagnoses
On the back of these findings, Professor Stefanovska added further research may open up new frontiers in the understanding and diagnosis of various neurodegenerative and ageing-related diseases to improve diagnostic procedures and patient prognosis.
The discovery came to light during the development of a new method of investigating brain function, which has revealed the stage in life when the brain starts to deteriorate. The findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports.
Previous research carried out by Imperial College London suggests brains grey matter, which enables the organ to function, shrinks during middle age and is related to cell death. White matter, which enables communication between nerve clusters, also appears to decline at around 40. This is also when the deterioration of myelin sheath occurs. Myelin sheath is a fatty substance that surrounds nerve cells and ensures proper function of the nervous system. These changes are thought to occur due to a reduction in the hormones dopamine and serotonin.
Brain surgery could spread Alzheimers disease
This comes after research released earlier this month suggested brain surgery may spread Alzheimers disease. Amyloid proteins, which have previously been associated with the condition, may be transmitted on poorly cleaned surgical instruments used during such procedures, a study implies.
After analysing four people aged 30-to-57 with brain bleeds caused by the build-up of amyloid plaques, researchers discovered they all underwent brain surgery when they were younger.
This may explain why the amyloid protein, which normally only affects people over 65, accumulated in the younger patients, the scientists add. Previous studies suggest tiny amounts of amyloid proteins can stick to steel wires and be transmitted into animals brains.
Past findings also show abnormal proteins responsible for the degenerative brain disorder Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can be transmitted between patients during certain medical procedures.
The researchers add, however, the build-up of amyloid proteins does not necessarily indicate Alzheimers disease, with none of the studys participants showing signs of early-onset dementia.

Cricket Australia has clarified that despite the win in the T-20 series against New Zealand and England, Australian cricket team is not the top.
Instead of Australia, Pakistan is in the top of the T-20 rankings.
Australia won the series by defeating New Zealand by 19 runs in Auckland.
In a statement, Cricket Australia said that due to the clerical error of ICC, there was a mistake in the calculation and Pakistan is still at the top in the rankings.
Australias 125.84 on the ranking round off 125.65 points and Pakistan 125.84 points i.e. Australia is 0.19 points behind from Pakistan.

Police refute murder allegation
Panadura Chief Magistrate Chandima Liyanage directed Western Province Deputy Inspector General of Police to hold a comprehensive investigation into the cause of death of a patient who escaped from the Panadura Base Hospital on February 19.
His body was found at the foot of a high building situated close to the Panadura South Police the next day.
Relatives of the deceased, W. Wasantha Kumara, were not satisfied with the investigations conducted by the Panadura South Police Crime Branch.
When further magisterial inquiry was conducted on February 21, Attorney-at-law Namal Perera appearing for the wife of the deceased, informed court that she suspected that her husband was murdered. The police had not conducted a proper inquiry into the death of her husband, she alleged.
The wife suspected that when he escaped from the hospital, he had come to the Panadura South Poilce and the policemen on duty that night had assaulted him and chased him out of the station. The lawyer produced a CD before court.
Panadura South Police ASP Clement Fernando who conducted an inquiry into the allegation of the deceaseds assault by policemen, denied that the police had assaulted him when he visited the station that night.
However, the ASP mentioned in his report submitted to the Police that the policemen on that night had been negligent in duty and action will be taken against him.
Ragama Hospital AJMO Dr. Kumarage who had performed the autopsy on W. Wasantha Kumara on the orders of the Panadura Chief Magistrate had submitted his report to court and informed that there were no assault injuries on the body of the deceased, but the injuries had been caused when he fell from a high spot.
Police Sergeant Samanlal Edirisinghe, representing the Panadura South Police, informed court that the deceased had been a patient of the Panadura Base Hospital and had escaped from the hospital and visited the Panadura Police Station and when he made a scene, policemen had asked him to go.
He then left and the following day his body was found at the foot of a four-storeyed building situated at a distance of the Panadura South Police
The Police summoned the Chief Magistrate to the scene and conducted the magisterial inquiry. He ordered the Ragama Hospital AJMO to perform the autopsy on the body of the deceased and submit the judicial report.
Panadura ASP Clement Fernando had conducted an inquiry on the orders of the court and submitted his report that some of the policemen on duty had performed duties negligently and an inquiry is pending.

An open letter to Prof. G.L. Peiris
Politics, policies and rhetoric
Prof. G.L Peiris Chairman / SLPPDear Professor Peiris,
I thought I should write to you at this time and at the outset may I congratulate you on the performance of the SLPP, the new political party of which you are the Chairman. The performance of the SLPP was somewhat better than many expected, though as you are well aware, fell far short of what a successful comeback by the Rajapaksas would require. The basic political formulae of 2015, that of Rajapaksa verses the rest, still held true and while you garnered an impressive 4.9 million votes nationally this is considerably less than the 5.7 million, an unsuccessful effort of Mahinda Rajapaksa in January 2015. The percentage vote also of the SLPP at 44%, is also less than the losing 47% polled by Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015. This, however, is still a creditable performance but probably owes more to the fact that the rainbow coalitions progeny, the national unity government of the UNP and the SLFP had not delivered on the high expectations, hopes and aspirations the people reposed in them in January and indeed August 2015. Tempting though it must be, I hope you would not be obstructionist with regard to the attempted reforms by the government going forward.
However, I write with regard to several concerns and issues, which would profit from your attention.
Post-election violence
The first area of concern has been reports of some of your successful candidates at the election engaging in post-election violence, intimidation and harassment against their opponents and shockingly against women candidates. While the primary reason was lax policing after the election, the responsibility should be with the perpetrators, who are unfortunately mostly from your party. Reports are emerging that the integrity and moral quotient of some or many of your candidates are quite suspect. You may not want to further promote such individuals nor condone their violence. Frankly, if this is the response to winning a local election, we can well anticipate the night of the long knives which would likely be unleashed in the eventuality of success at a general election.
Opposing constitutional reforms and anti-minority rhetoric
It has been particularly distressing to witness the politics, policies and rhetoric utilized by the Rajapaksa comeback project in opposing reforms and reconciliation. While parochial narrow ethnoreligious nationalism is always morally repugnant and intellectually hollow, as you have discovered, the appeal to baser instincts are always electorally attractive though at a huge collective social cost.
I would appeal that you and the JO front bench, which is notably mono-ethnic be mindful of the diversity of Sri Lankan society and the need for political reforms in a post-war environment. The tone, tenor and content of the political rhetoric emanating from your partys senior political leadership has been anti-minority. You are no doubt aware of the allegations made in Parliament by the Leader of the Opposition and the TNA, regarding the misinformation, carried on by your party before, during and after the election. Your counter that the TNA ceded Tamil political space and authority to LTTE during the war years, is rather disingenuous considering that your chief allies in the Tamil areas of the Eastern Province are all former leaders and fighters in the LTTE. Moreover, the support by the ITAK to the LTTE was obtained through the barrel of a gun and through the murder of many of their leaders. Really post-war reconciliation and healing a polarized society requires more statesmanship or responsibility than your political masters and co-travellers have demonstrated.
I also read with interest your post-election statement that there is a conspiracy to drive a wedge between the Muslim Community and the SLPP and its Rajapaksa comeback project. You would no doubt be aware that the SLPP fared disastrously among both the Muslim as well as the Tamil community voters. Your party secured just 1% of the vote in the Jaffna District and 1.5% of the vote in the Batticaloa District. The attacks on mosques, the anti-halal movement and the burning of Korans started in the post-war period under the Rajapaksa Administration. The extremist organisations, which in-fact welcomed your electoral successes were provided with both covert and even overt assistance during the Rajapaksa years. They have been defanged since 2015 but have received a fresh lease of life from the politics and rhetoric of the SLPP.
The Leader of the Opposition and a general election
I must say I was very surprised that for a party headed by a professor of laws, that there seems a demonstrated ignorance of the basic tenants of constitutional governance. Firstly, by what stretch of the imagination can a plurality of the vote in local municipal elections give rise to negating the mandate of the people at an earlier general election. Really the former president should be better advised by you. Demanding that the President sack the Prime Minister is neither justified constitutionally under the 19th Amendment, the signature achievement of the unity government nor indeed even politically. The concurrent exercise of independent public mandates cannot be a concept unknown to you.
Then there was a ludicrous demand by your allies for the position of the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament to be handed over to former President Rajapaksa. The serious obstacle to this arises from the fact that he is elected to Parliament as a member of the UPFA. The President as head of the Cabinet and Government is also head of the UPFA and the UPFA is formally part of the Government as most recently confirmed in Parliament by the General Secretary of the UPFA. You would no doubt agree that it would be ridiculous for both the head of government and the leader of the opposition, to be from the same party.
I trust the above would be of assistance in the days ahead as the SLPP / JO charts its future course.
Yours sincerely
Harim Peiris

All SLPA employees would be granted a monthly salary increase of Rs. 10,000 from January 2018.
Of this increment, Rs. 5,000 would be added to the basic salary and the balance Rs. 5,000 would be added as an allowance.
The Minister thanked all 23 port unions for lending their support towards this measure.
He said steps would be taken to resolve problems and suggestions raised by the unions in the near future. SLPA Chairman De. Parakrama Dissanayake, Vice-Chairman P.G. Dsssanayake and other officials participated.
The Sri Lanka Ports Authority has recorded a Rs. 13.2 billion (Rs. 13,200 million) profit last year.
This is the highest annual profit recorded in the history of the Authority, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
Addressing a meeting of trade union delegates at the Ministry Auditorium on February 25, Minister Samarasinghe said instant action taken towards the progress and development of the SLPA had enabled it to achieve this profit.
He said the new collective agreement of the SLPA had gained Treasury approval due to several months of negotiations.

President reshuffles UNP pack
The much awaited Cabinet shuffle of the National Unity Government took place yesterday, with President Maithripala Sirisena changing six ministerial portfolios and appointing three state ministers and one deputy minister.
President Sirisena swore in new ministers from the United National Party while promising changes in the United Peoples Freedom Alliance portfolios, within the next two weeks.
The President, while congratulating the newly appointed Cabinet, State and Deputy Ministers, said in keeping with the message received from the electorate, changes and corrective measures would be taken in order to implement the future programme of work successfully on behalf of the people.
These changes as well as those soon to be made on the UPFA side of the government, will strengthen us to better serve our people, the President added.
In the Cabinet re-shuffle, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed as the Minister of Law and Order.
The Prime Minister will also function as the Minister of National Policy and Economic Affairs.
However, sources at the Prime Ministers office said that Premier Wickremesinghe has accepted the Law and Order portfolio only for a short period of time.
Minister Sagala Ratnayaka who was the Law and Order Minister before, was appointed the Minister of Youth Affairs and Southern Development.
Minister Harin Fernando was given the ministerial portfolio of Foreign Employment, in addition to his Digital Infrastructure Ministry.
The Foreign Employment portfolio was earlier held by Minister Thalatha Atukorale who is the Justice Minister.

Protect yourself from sandfly bites
Leishmaniasis is a worldwide vector borne zoonotic disease caused by several heteroxenous intracellular parasitic organisms of genus Leishmania. The disease has several different forms including three main forms, namely, visceral leishmaniasis (VL), cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL), where VL is considered to be the most virulent form of the disease. Although several case reports provide evidences for sexual or vertical transmission, the main method of transmission of this disease is through the bite of the female sand flies of subfamily Phlebotominae. The sand fly bite is believed to occur from dawn to dusk. But the Sri Lankan experience shows otherwise and indicates that people are bitten by this disease carrying insect even during day times. The life cycle of the Leishmania parasite has a biological phase within the body of the sand fly and that has to be completed for the disease to be transmitted to a human. The Sinhala name for the sand fly is either velimessa or hohaputuwa. Leishmaniasis has been listed as one of the eight major neglected tropical parasitic diseases with prevalence in more than 90 countries where 88 of them are endemic to the disease.
Senior Registrar in Community Medicine and Head of the Health Care Quality Unit, Department of Health, Southern Province, Dr. Amila Chandrasiri MBBS (Colombo), MSc, MD (Community Medicine), Diploma in International Relations) talks about Leishmaniasis.
Q - What is Leishmaniasis
A- Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani. It is seen in tropical countries. Recently it emerged in Sri Lanka as well especially in the Southern province. So we need to pay attention and be aware of this disease.
It appears in several forms. The most common forms are skin or cutaneous Leishmaniasis, which causes skin sores, and internal or Visceral Leishmaniasis, which affects several internal organs (usually spleen, liver, and bone marrow). It can cause ulcers in nose, mouth, or throat (which is known as Mucosal Leishmaniasis).
Q - Is it a deadly disease
A- Yes. But skin form is usually not fatal. But if left untreated severe (advanced) cases of Visceral Leishmaniasis can bring death.
Q - How is Leshmaniasis transmitted
A- It is spread by the bite of sand fly (phlebotomine). These insects are so tiny and can move very fast. People usually are bitten when they work outside.
Q - What are the symptoms of Leishmaniasis
A- Some have asymptomatic infections. Commonest presenting complain is a non healing ulcer - The ulcer may start out as a little bump and may end up as ulcers (like a volcano, with a raised edge and central crater); skin ulcers may be covered by scab or crust. The sores usually are painless but can be painful. Some people have swollen glands near the sores (for example, under the arm, if the sores are on the arm or hand).
In internal type fever, weight loss, enlargement (swelling) of the spleen and liver can be seen.
Q - What are the investigations done for Leishmaniasis
A- For definitive diagnosis, tissue samples from skin sores (for cutaneous leishmaniasis) or from bone marrow (for visceral leishmaniasis) can be examined for the parasite under a microscope. In addition to that antibody tests can also be done. Full Blood Count also shows certain changes like low red blood cell count (anemia), a low white blood cell count, and a low platelet count.
Q - How do you treat Leishmaniasis patients
A- There are few treatment methods depending on type of Leishmaniasis. For skin type, a special therapy call cryotherapy is being done. In addition to that injecting drugs around the ulcer is also done. Oral drugs are given. For visceral type, IV drugs (as injections) are also given.
Q - How can we prevent Laishmaniasis
A- It is difficult to control vector. Best way is avoiding bites. Avoid outdoor activities, especially from dusk to dawn (evening, night till next morning), when sand flies generally are the most active. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin and wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and socks.

Restoring equal rights and dignity in face of adversity
Tuesday, February 20, 2018, marked the 12th annual United Nations World Day of Social Justice, a day dedicated to advancing a world that promotes a peaceful and prosperous co-existence. It also encourages people to look at how social justice affects poverty eradication. It also focuses on the goal of achieving full employment and support for social integration.
The UN theme for 2018 is titled: Workers on the Move: The Quest for Social Justice. Most migration today is linked directly or indirectly to the search for decent work opportunities. Even if employment is not the primary driver, it usually features in the migration process at some point.
There are an estimated 258 million international migrants. The International Labour Organisation, ILO, estimates that there are roughly 150 million migrant workers. Among migrant workers, 56 percent are men and 44 percent are women.
The quest for social justice has been an historical journey for migrant workers who are often exposed to the risk of exploitation in countries of origin, transit and destination. The lack of social justice, in particular for low-wage migrant workers, includes the risk of being trapped into jobs with poor wages and working conditions, often in the informal economy. They are exposed to violations of labour and other human rights.
In one of his most famous writings, Letter from Birmingham Jail, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said of injustice: Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.
In other words, the very existence of injustice has implications for us all. As such, we each have a responsibility to actively challenge unjust power structures wherever they should surface.
There are many aspects to justice and the creation of a just world. These include social and economic factors as well as the principles of equity and equal rights. Yet social justice has been defined in a variety of ways. Among them, they incorporate concepts of basic rights, the realisation of human potential, social benefit, a healthy planet, an equitable distribution of resources, equal opportunities and obligations, security, and freedom from discrimination.
Economic justice really forms a part of social justice. It seeks the equitable distribution of the worlds natural and intellectual wealth so that everyone is able to gain a fair share. Social justice means equal rights for all, regardless of gender, race, class, ethnicity, citizenship, religion, age or sexual orientation. It implies equal rights for women and girls in workplaces, homes and public life. It implies economic justice, which means governments must take active steps to alleviate poverty and redress past injustices. In a world where millions starve and minorities are discriminated against, such goals are still a long way off.
Governments have made a commitment to the creation of a framework for action that promotes social justice not only at national level, but internationally. In addition, Governments around the world have also pledged to promote equal distributions of income and resources and have recognised that a society for all needs to be based on respect for all human rights.
Across the world, there are thousands of examples of such injustice. It can take the form of repression, discrimination, harassment, or simply the failure to redress inequalities. Social justice means that the rights of all people in our community are considered in a fair and equitable manner. While equal opportunity targets everyone in the community, social justice targets the marginalised and disadvantaged groups of people in our society.
Urgent action should be taken to increase the number of work opportunities in order to alleviate tensions. Policies need to focus more on strengthening employment and tackling the inequalities. Furthermore, vulnerable employment is concerning high in developing economics with peaks in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
Public policies should ensure that all people have equal access to health care services. People living in isolated communities should have the same access to clean water and sanitation as a person living in an urban area. People of a low socio-economic background should receive the same quality health services that a person in a higher socio-economic income receives.
Information designed to educate the community must be provided in languages that the community can understand. Many of the themes and agendas over the years have focused on child labour, which refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives them of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school, and that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful.
Not all work done by children should be classified as child labour that is to be targeted for elimination. The participation of children or adolescents in work that does not affect their health and personal development or interfere with their schooling, is generally regarded as being something positive.
This includes activities such as helping their parents around the home, assisting in a family business or earning pocket money outside school hours and during school holidays. These kinds of activities contribute to childrens development and to the welfare of their families.
They provide them with skills and experience, and help to prepare them to be productive members of society during their adult life. The term child labour is often defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development.
Forced labour in general takes different forms, including debt bondage, human trafficking and other forms of modern slavery. The most vulnerable victims are women and girls forced into prostitution, migrants trapped in debt bondage and sweatshop or farm workers kept there by clearly illegal tactics and paid little or nothing.
No one can be blind to the reality that a generation of children have grown up hearing gunshots, dodging bullets and living in fear for their lives. Many were forced to become adults before the age of 10, constrained to carry arms and fight in senseless wars they could not comprehend.
Several children dragooned into becoming child soldiers have been maimed, raped and impregnated by men they did not know, or threatened by men who had once sworn to protect them. These children have suffered numerous atrocities and abuses they could not articulate. Many were forced to live in refugee camps, became victims of sex trafficking, or grew up without parents while suffering through the heartaches and pains of a country in turmoil. These types of illegal exploitation and forced enslavement are horrendous crimes against humanity. It is time for all right-thinking citizens of the world to rise in one accord and call for a screeching end to such despotic criminality in all its reprehensible forms.

Salah scores again as Liverpool thrash West Ham
LONDON, Saturday - Mohamed Salah was inevitably on the scoresheet as Liverpool took full advantage of the inactivity of their top-four rivals to thrash West Ham United 4-1 at Anfield and provisionally move into second in the Premier League.
With leaders Manchester City facing Arsenal in the League Cup final on Sunday, when Manchester United host Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur travel to Crystal Palace in the league, Juergen Klopps free scorers topped 100 goals for the season in their 40th match.
Emre Can, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane also netted in another Liverpool goalrush that moved them 15 points behind Pep Guardiolas City. At the bottom of the table, the future of West Bromwich Albion manager Alan Pardew looks increasingly bleak after their 2-1 defeat at home to relegation rivals Huddersfield Town.
Swansea City crashed 4-1 at Brighton & Hove Albion and Bournemouth came from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Newcastle United.
Liverpools win was not quite as routine as the scoreline suggested with West Ham occasionally threatening on another nerve-tingling Anfield afternoon although David Moyes long wait for a first win at the ground continues.
Salah scored for the sixth successive game in all competitions and his goal took him level with Harry Kane at the top of the Premier League scoring charts with 23 this season.
But Can was equally influential in Liverpools win, heading the opener and laying on a superb through pass for Firmino to score Liverpools third before Mane chipped in with a fourth goal in two games.
It is difficult to be top, Manchester City are too far away, but of course we want to finish second, said the German, whose six league goals represent the best haul of his Liverpool career which could be in its final season as his contract expires at the end of the campaign.
Elsewhere, West Broms defeat will add to the pressure on manager Pardew whose side are now seven points off safety.
Rajiv van La Parra and Steve Mounie scored for Huddersfield, whose win moved them three points up the table, one point ahead of Newcastle.
Rafa Benitezs side looked to be guaranteed back-to-back victories for the first time since September after Dwight Gayle ended his recent goal drought by scoring twice before the interval.
Yet Adam Smith and former Newcastle midfielder Dan Gosling completed an astonishing comeback by one of the leagues never-say-die specialists.
Its another point that nudges us towards where we want to be -- every one could be vital at the end of the season, said Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe.
Swansea also scored late at Brighton but Lewis Dunks own goal proved academic with the home side already 3-0 up. Dutchman Juergen Locadias goal on his Premier League debut completed the rout as Swansea dropped back into the relegation zone, just ahead of Stoke City, who drew 1-1 with Leicester City.
It would have been better for Paul Lamberts side had keeper Jack Butland not parried the ball into his own net when under no obvious pressure, a howler made all the more embarrassing by the presence of former Stoke, Leicester and England legend Peter Shilton in the stands.
Manager Lambert refused to criticise his keeper, whom he described as the best in Britain although such an obvious howler will do little to help Butland secure the England jersey for the World Cup.
At Turf Moor, Southamptons Manolo Gabbiadini scored a 90th-minute equaliser as the visitors secured a nerve-jangling 1-1 draw at Burnley, who still await their first win of the year.
Everton remained in ninth place but still only seven points above the relegation zone after a 1-0 defeat at Watford who moved up to 10th in a tangled bottom half. Troy Deeney scored Watfords late winner at Vicarage Road. - Agencies

SASA Pavahan to capture Canada, Europe markets
The story of SASA began in 1989 where the founders, Nelson Perera and H.D. Vijayalatha commenced manufacturing slippers in their garage, an idea proposed by H.D. Vijayalatha which was made a reality with one employee at Kohuwala, Woodland Avenue.
Listening to his wifes words, Nelson Perera obtained advice from his best friend, Sarnapala, the founder of Sala Shoes at Homagama.
It is a very engaging industry, but competition levels are so high that when 5 manufacturers step in, 10 drop-outs take place.
Co - founder Nelson Perera opening their first own footwear retail outlet 2012, in Piliyandala
His reliable advice encouraged and determined them to enter the footwear industry.
While operations continued their eldest son, N.P. Nevil Perera joined his parents right after his A-levels at Isipathana College. As he saw a thriving market and a bright future, they decided to register under their brand name, SASA Pavahan in the year 1991 as a sole proprietor organisation with four employees.
The sole proprietor organisation soon outgrew into a family business, Sasa Enterprise by 1994 when their younger sons joined after completing their studies. The stability of their operations was rewarded with the agreement of sub-contracts from Sri Lankas leading footwear manufacturers.
When N.P. Nevil Perera expressed his gratefulness with us to the Industrial Development Board (IDB) who equipped him with sufficient knowledge on the technical aspects of the industry, to the Export Development Board (EDB) who provided him and his fellow equals with an in-depth knowledge, understanding and experience on the international ground by bearing all expenses involved in visiting countries like Italy, China, Indonesia and Bangkok for exhibitions and factory visits, and also to Nandadasa Rajapaksha, the Chairman of Samson Group, who provided his kind assistance to obtain bank loans during certain periods of financial crisis.
He shared his valuable experience, tactics and struggles in the industry with me so closely that it felt like a father educating his very own son. For that, Im forever thankful.
Along with growth and the accumulated guidance, experience and support gained, the brothers felt the need for change in business structures. By 2007, Sasa Enterprise outgrew into N.P.N. Perera Company (Pvt) Ltd as per the common initials among the brothers, N. Prasad Nalin Perera and N. Prabash Narada Perera with SASA as their official shoe brand name.
At the same year, their factory relocated to Kesbewa, Makandana fully equipped with machinery of the latest technology providing better health and safety standards for their 50 employees. The Union Bank, Sampath Bank and Bank of Ceylon (BOC), their trusted source of finance have helped them greatly with funding these expenses by offering them low credit margins.
Co - founder H. D. Vijayalatha inaugurating the first venture
By 2012, SASA expanded their wings to open their first own footwear retail outlet at Piliyandala, 59, Main Street. Since then, the brothers have decided to manufacture shoes to dress up a whole family. In addition, SASA launched a leather footwear collection which was supported significantly by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce as leather skins were allowed to be imported with a duty free offer  a special mention by N. P. Nevil Perera.
Continuous success had grown a strong belief among the brothers to establish island-wide distributions by the year 2015. As a result, SASA shoes can now be found anywhere ranging from Kandy to Anuradhapura to Jaffna to Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Chilaw, Rathnapura, Balangoda, Embilipitiya, Galle to Dewundara and many more cities and towns.
N.P. Nevil Perera also said that the Sri Lankan Leather Product and Footwear Association has brought in enthusiasm among the industry by conducting an annual Leather Product and Footwear Exhibition, a place where all leading and certain petite figures gather to showcase their produce. In fact, at the 2018 Leather Product and Footwear Exhibition, SASA was crowned as the second runner up for The Most Attractive Shoes award.
We are delighted with our progress and have gained confidence to achieve our next milestone  to export our products to the Canadian and European markets.
N.P. Nevil Perera said, In every move we make, the precious advice from Sarnapala, our humble start and our craftsmanship has remained at the depths of our hearts.
The secret behind SASA is that although the brothers are ranked in the managerial levels, they actively take part in the production and distribution departments as a method of opting unnecessary expenses which aids them to provide a sensible price for a pair of strong and superior quality shoes as a reward for the continuous support given by their valuable customers suiting their very own stylish needs. The brothers stressed the value they have upon their customers as their strength, the reason for success and have high hopes on future support as well.
Regarding the current issues of the industry, a large-scale Indian footwear plant has been given access to various major benefits which arent even provided to the local manufacturers. Moreover theres a large proportion of Chinese imported footwear been dumped into the market where consumers are misled with a falsely promised quality at a lower rate.
Most Sri Lankan manufacturers have high expectations from the Government to implement on wise policies safeguarding the local manufacturers. This is a major threat to our industry as a level playing field is not provided, but as we have a very loyal and strong customer base who respects locally produced products, we arent yet hit by these major threats. I humbly request from all our dear Sri Lankans to support us and all Sri Lankan manufacturers.
There is a vast untold story behind every pair of locally produced shoes or perhaps of any locally produced product N.P. Nevil Perera said.
Although weve recruited only 50 direct employees, that is providing income for 50 families and others who are dependent upon them, there are hundreds and thousands of indirect employees such as our retailers and suppliers and their employees who, if you purchase a local produce, could provide our own people with sufficient income to minimise starvation and bring in the ability for them to afford education and healthcare for themselves and their children. That mentioned, I humbly request you to purchase not only locally produced shoes, but all locally produced products.

The silenced language
Although it was only one hundred years ago, it seems to my generation like some mythical age. The Mapuche could roam freely across their territory and communicated with the elements of the mapu. Mapuzungun means language of the land. The land speaks. All its beings have language, and the Mapuche know it.
Mapuzungun was the first language, and it was taught and learned in optimal conditions. In the shade of elders, new saplings grew, a perfect green preceding the rituals, near the water.
The women would sing their tayles, which transmitted power, and the pride of being who one is was not a philosophical question.
But the death that has crept toward the First Peoples of the Americas since 1492 left no stone unturned in the south. The war for the desert, the winka raids, signaled military defeat and the occupation of territory by the Argentine state. The end of the world took place one hundred years ago.
Concentration camps
Mapuzungun became the language for expressing pain, the language of despondence during the divvying up of men, women, and children as slaves. The clandestine whisper in the concentration camps. The language of solace among prisoners of war. The language for thought.
It was the language of the long road of exile, the distance of banishment. Of the harsh march of our great-grandparents to reservations, ka mapu.
Our grandparents were sent to rural schools and made bilingual by force. But however banned by the schools, where teachers shamed children for their home language, Mapuzungun endured. The language of the land was in the air of orality; Spanish in the writing crossed out in workbooks.
Linguistic anthropologists, ka mollfunche, tried to write it. They created dictionaries and grammar. Just as they tried to trap the territory within barbed-wire fences, so, too, did they try to trap the sound of Mapuzungun within Western graphemes.
Im talking about an ancient language and the ignorance of men who mapped a country over a territory full of names, elements, and meanings, silencing it.
Im talking about what we lost. All of us.
Constant threats
Within our community, the politics of shame wreaked havoc. Mapuzungun became a stigma, the mark of inferiority of those admitted by force to the capitalist system as cheap labor. Perhaps the elders made a decision to stop teaching it. Could they get together Did they speak in Mapuzungun of the future Maybe they simply went silent, determining their knowledge to no longer suffice, that the saplings could manage better without them in this new world of constant threats, stigmas, accusations, smirks.
Mapuzungun was the language of conversation of the elders, the language for summoning the elements in the intimacy of dawn. The language of defense. Of silence. The city offered work and study to the saplings. Our parents arrived monolingual, without ngillatun, without Mapuzungun, exchanging the natural cycle of time for work hours and school calendars.
And we entered local schools, bearing our faces and surnames, without any language for which to feel ashamed, with Spanish as our one and only tongue, without history or memory.
Im talking about Puel Mapu and the history of my family, which is the history of so many families, and which explains the loss of our language as mother tongue by the majority of my generation. Im talking about an ancient language and the ignorance of men who mapped a country over a territory full of names, elements, and meanings, silencing it. Im talking about what we lost. All of us.
Mapuche ta iche
All of us who were born without knowing the names of every plant, every stone, and every bird of this land.
I woke in the middle of a lake. In gasps I tried to give thanks but didnt know the words. They hadnt been taught to me. I found in poetry in Spanish the possibility to express something of the profundity that flooded me. And gods nostalgia, which is to say a cosmovision, carried me down the path to recovering his language.
On the 500th birthday of the discord, we began to emerge from the brush, and with each step we returned closer to our roots, making ourselves visible. Wed say Mapuche ta iche to recognize ourselves and repair the damage theyd done to us bit by bit.
Mapuzungun is the language of the recovery of pride, the language of the reconstruction of memory.
The conditions for teaching and learning our language are ever more difficult because as time passes, the elders bearing our knowledge die. The federal government should push a linguistic politics to accelerate and support with resources the process of recovery of our language. A process of recovery to include not only orality but also our adoption of writing and of the creation of methods for teaching and learning our language as a second language.
To learn it is to travel a path of amazements. My heart swells each time I explain that in Mapuzungun, besides the singular and plural, there exist the dual pronouns ichiu, meaning we two; eymu, meaning you two; and fey eng, meaning them two. Pairs give balance to our cosmovision.
I learn and practice the words for summoning and serving the elements. I live in the city, where I have a profession and struggle not to succumb to Western individualism: Kishungenelan is the teaching given us by the elders.
I think and write in Spanish and later translate it clumsily into the language that seduces me with its immense, deep blue.

SLPA posts record Rs 13.2 bn  profit in 2017
The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) has posted a record profit of Rs. 13.2 billion in 2017.
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe revealed these figures at a convocation held in Colombo to coincide with the 24th Annual Awards Ceremony, organized by the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers (UK) Sri Lanka branch.
Minister Samarasinghe said this recorded profit of Rs. 13.2 billion could he used to expand infrastructure facilities in the Colombo Harbour and when comparing to the profit of Rs one billion recorded in 2016, last years profit could be regarded as the highest ever earned by the SLPA.
There are indications that the SLPA even this year will earn the same profit or more than that, he said. Samarasinghe commenting on the Hambantota Port joint venture said the country will receive US Dollars 518 million in May this year and this could also be utilized to carry out more development activities. He said in future the SLPA will work with its strong partner the China Merchant Port , the second largest port in the world.
This year China merchant port has also earmarked to spend approximately 160 million US dollars for infrastructure development activities,
Minister Samarasinghe highlighted these earnings help the country to be free from huge debt burden one day and said all infrastructure development in the Colombo Harbour can be completed within a short period. He also highlighted about the development of foreign cruise liners which are currently by passing Sri Lanka .
We have plans to improve infrastructure facilities in the Colombo Harbour in order to facilitate cruise liners, he emphasized. The minister said the Government has already discussed with the Sri Lanka Tourism, the Tourist Board and with travel agents regarding the development of cruise liners which will help to bring a large sum of foreign exchange.
Minister Samarasinghe also focused attention towards the development of Trincomalee Harbour as the District should be developed to improve the tourism industry.
He said in addition, steps have been taken to develop the infrastructure facilities of several other harbours including the Kankasanturai Harbour, Oluvil fishers Harbour and the Galle Harbour. Over 20 students received certificates and awards at the ceremony.
ICS (UK) Sri Lanka Branch, Chairperson Anoma Ranasinghe and SLPA, Chairman Dr. Parakrama Dissanayaka also spoke. The Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers (ICS) is a professional society for members of the commercial shipping industry worldwide. It was founded in 1911 in London.
The ICS was granted a Royal Charter in 1920. The Institute provides the shipping industry with highly qualified professionals.

SP traders fined over Rs. 11 mn last year
Southern Province (SP) Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) investigation officials have collected Rs. 11,488,000 from errant traders as court fines through sudden raids and mobile inspections conducted in the South during last year.
The total number of raids done in the Southern region during 2017 was 2,772.
Accordingly, the number of raids carried out in the Galle district was 768 and the revenue collected from them was Rs. 3,435,500, raids conducted in the Matara district were 972 and the income collected was Rs. 3,903,500, and the number of raids made in the Hambantota district was 982 and a revenue of Rs. 4,149,000 was obtained through them.
Errant traders were prosecuted at the Galle, Matara, and Hambantota Magistrates Courts. Charges filed against them were selling rice at exorbitant rates, hoarding of rice varieties, sale and display of food items unsuitable for human consumption, altering set prices on labels, selling electrical appliances without issuing warranty cards, masking of price tags, among other offences.
Given the rising number of complaints by the public regarding such malpractices, the CAA has increased its number of sudden raids and mobile inspections, investigation officials said.

Superb Scotland stuns England to end grand slam aspirations
EDINBURGH, Saturday - Scotland produced a blistering display of attacking rugby to hand Eddie Jones just his second defeat as England head coach and end the visitors grand slam aspirations with a 25-13 Six Nations victory at Murrayfield on Saturday.
Led by the brilliance of Huw Jones, who scored a brace of tries, and Finn Russell -- criticised before the game but at the heart of Scotlands best play -- the hosts opened up a 16-point halftime lead, with Sean Maitland also touching down. England improved after the break with a converted Owen Farrell try, but Sam Underhill was shown a yellow card to inhibit hopes of a comeback as the hosts held out for a famous victory in Gregor Townsends first Calcutta Cup fixture as head coach.
Its a great feeling. We knew how important this week was going to be, what it meant to our supporters and the players played with real pride, Townsend said.
There was also real intensity, and great accuracy - especially in the first half. We forced mistakes. We discussed opportunities we felt we could create and it was pleasing the way we took them. Following a pre-game scuffle in the tunnel, the opening exchanges were full-blooded but dominated by Scotland who showed plenty of attacking intent which yielded a penalty, kicked by Greig Laidlaw for a 3-0 lead.
Buoyed by a vociferous crowd the hosts consistently stretched the visitors defence and Jones collected a deft Russell grubber kick to dive over next to the posts to score Scotlands first home try against England since 2004. Farrell kept the visitors in touch with two penalties, but their attack was lethargic and in defence they simply could not contain Scotland with Russell and Jones combining to create the field position for Maitland to dive over in the corner. At 15-6 down, a series of attacking penalties hampered England and their indiscipline was compounded shortly before halftime when Jones burst through and held off Mike Brown and Anthony Watson to score.
Englands response after the break was emphatic with Farrell cutting a superb line through the Scottish defence to reduce the deficit to nine points in the 44th minute.
Farrell had a second try ruled out following a knock on in the build-up but any hopes of closing the gap further were dealt a major blow when Underhill was shown yellow for a dangerous tackle in the 66th minute.
Russells resulting penalty gave Scotland a 12-point lead which they defended superbly to thwart Englands attacking raids and seal a stunning victory that keeps alive their hopes of winning their first Six Nations title since the tournament expanded. Jones, who had previously compared Scotlands playing style to that of the All Blacks, was humble in defeat and congratulated the hosts on their win.
They were too good for us. Unfortunately we were not in the game in the first 40. Scotland played well. Full marks to Scotland, he told ITV. We knew what we were going to get but we didnt meet the challenge today for some reason. Second half I was very proud of the effort of the boys. We really stuck in there and won the second half. - Agencies

UNHRC urged to play critical role in encouraging SLs accountability
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein has urged the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to continue to play a critical role in encouraging progress in accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
In his report on Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka to the 37th session of the Human Rights Council, which will be held from today to March 23 in Geneva, the High Commissioner also called on member states to explore other avenues, including the application of universal jurisdiction, that could foster accountability in Sri Lanka.
Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 34/1, the report is an update on progress made in the implementation of resolution 30/1 on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka during the period from March 2017 to January 2018, in particular with regard to the governments commitment to put in place transitional justice measures.
In the present update, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also looks at the general human rights situation in the country, including with respect to accountability.
In his report, the High Commissioner, while reiterating his appreciation for the constructive engagement of the government of Sri Lanka with OHCHR and United Nations human rights mechanisms since January 2015, noted that this constructive collaboration must be accompanied by the implementation of key commitments.
He said the fulfilment of the transitional justice commitments made under Human Rights Council resolution 30/1 has been virtually stalled for more than a year.
He noted further in the report that the progress with some confidence-building measures has often been insufficient and inconclusive and the structures set up to coordinate implementation have not consolidated enough or did not receive sufficient political support to move things forward.
In statements and reports issued since 2015, the High Commissioner, while expressing concern over the lack of progress on accountability and reforms, was encouraged by the positive improvement of the general human rights situation.
However, 2017 was marked by intermittent inter-ethnic tensions and attacks on minorities which are unlikely to dissipate completely, the report said.
While the government has managed to steer many of these worrying events in a positive direction, this type of violence in a country that has experienced cycles of extreme violence roughly every 10 years is deeply troubling, particularly when accompanied by hate speech, misinformation and agitation through social media and political manipulation.
The Commissioners report said that the continuing allegations of torture and surveillance and the lack of sufficient progress in implementing critical confidence-building measures, such as the release of land, the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the solution to the pending cases under the Act, have antagonized key constituencies that could be instrumental to the governments reform efforts.
Commissioner Al Hussein urged that the Human Rights Council should continue to play a critical role in encouraging progress in accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. It also calls on member states to explore other avenues, including the application of universal jurisdiction, that could foster accountability, said the report.

## Title: Unseen negatives of human-elephant conflict

Unseen negatives of human-elephant conflict
Farmers and elephants have struggled with each other to protect their territory from the other, for the last several decades in Sri Lanka. The struggle has captured the attention of local news channels frequently due to damage to property, destruction of crops and the loss of human life, all of which is collateral damage. This has led the people to constantly ask for a sustainable solution to the problem and the search for such a solution emphasises the necessity of a dialogue on the mitigation of the human elephant conflict (HEC).
Respective government agencies have given the issue their consideration. However, measures such as electric fencing have not addressed the problem completely. This failure has created many negative impacts on both elephants and humans today. Statistics from the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) show a huge loss and damage annually due to this struggle.
On the face of it, the public is generally aware that the Department of Wildlife spends large amounts of public money to compensate persons for the damage caused by wild elephants every year.
Unseen costs
However, what is not often seen and yet critical is that though the existing monetary compensation schemes may help victims re-build their livelihoods to a certain extent, there are several unseen and uncompensated cost components in their lives which can lead to a problematic situation in many ways.
Cost components such as lost labour, lost time spent on crops and plantations and destroyed houses and buildings have not be considered in the existing compensation scheme. For instance, compensation for significant damage to a mature coconut cultivation caused by elephants may not consider the labour, effort and the incurred lifespan of the farmer.
Moreover, the actions that are made on protection of crop lands, adaptation measures and risk-mitigating practices may not be accounted and will remain as unseen costs. These unseen costs would rest upon the shoulders of the individual farmers.
In this backdrop, monetary compensation purely based on market values and estimations are smaller than the actual damage incurred. The existing monetary compensation schemes help farmers build resilience inadequately and somewhat slowly. A severe shock may take many years to recover with such small compensation and support.
Thus compensation must be given to cover at least some portion of unseen costs by taking into consideration the views of the victims. Stakeholder discussions and farmer-centric strategies are needed to be implemented to identify appropriate compensation. For instance, similar issues have been researched in African countries and they have identified the importance of unseen cost components.
Nevertheless, the restoration process after a shock may require some other support like building materials, farm equipment, proper coordination, awareness and management. These non-monetary forms of supports are also critical even though liquid capital is more often than not preferred by farmers and frequently offered as compensation.
Farmers riskier in elephant land
Investment in and development of lands are also risky choices as a result of the persistent conflict with elephants in areas where the struggle exists. Further, it has reduced land values and created poor markets for real estate. The farmer has also, to a great extent, been limited from migration or the selling of their property in search of new safe habitats as a result of the conflict. Thus, they have been trapped in a frame which is uncommon and unseen generally elsewhere in the island. All these matters need to be taken into account through proper dialogue on behalf of the victims.
The frequent encounters and expectations of such situations could badly affect the mindsets and reduce the mental freedom of those who experience this as a daily occurrence in their daily lives. This fear and unpleasant situation may cause disappointment and limit the expectations of farmers. This too has been researched in African countries where similar issues exist. In certain studies, it has been observed that the affected people have poor mental health.
Moreover, farmers investment decisions have been affected by this phenomenon badly and this has resulted in poor income opportunities from their farms compared to other farmers. For instance, their decision making criteria has an additional risk component of elephant encounters in contrast to other farmers.
This may result in limited selection of crops and combinations. This opportunity cost of selection would add poor financial returns in comparison to other farmers. In addition, their daily routine has to be planned considering the unexpected elephant encounters. Therefore, actions like accompanying children to and from school and taking a patient to hospital during the night have to be performed in a more careful manner with mandatory supervision. These actions may require additional efforts, labour and time compared to other rural people elsewhere in the island. Therefore, from an economic perspective, their everyday actions are accompanied with a greater cost and time factor.
When considering the elephants as a resource to a particular area, two parties can be clearly identified that benefit differently at the same time. They are tourist hotel owners and shop owners, especially near national parks. Due to the high number of tourists, these parties enjoy financial benefits and are better off due to the elephants.
On the other hand, farmers are worse off due to the same group of elephants raiding crops and damaging property. They experience threats and struggle to live while sacrificing their leisure and happiness against elephant threats. This emphasises the necessity for proper monetary compensation to the people who take in the negative externality of the resource. However, this hidden cost component is not addressed and neither have measures been taken into consideration to effectively distribute the benefits equally to all. Thus it is good to use a proper benefit transfer method such as an additional hotel fee or fund to take care of the victims in the corresponding areas. In this regard, the awareness of all stakeholders and their mutual understanding of the problem are important. Farmers do not engage or benefit usually from tourism.
Thus, opportunities for selling their harvests to hotels or arranging special markets will distribute some benefits to the farmers. Promoting non-agricultural income activities via small industries like handicraft making and focusing on tourism may diversify their income sources. Such activities may contribute to changing their attitudes towards the elephants in a positive manner and reduce cruelty towards them.
Overcoming the conflict
When considering the elephants, they are the opposite side of the coin. They seek food and water in human settlements when they face scarcity in the jungle. This is especially observed during frequent crop raids and encounters during the drier seasons. This emphasises the importance of considering the ongoing climate change turbulence when planning elephant conservation mechanisms and farmer adaptation mechanisms.
These adaptation mechanisms may require precise weather forecasts or climate information products (CIP). Thus, these actions may have aggregated costs to society; such an example is the research and development of farmer-specific weather information dissemination systems. Nevertheless, individual costs also may result due to certain adaptation practices like irrigation and cultivation of crops which are less attractive to elephants to avoid pursuing such risks.
Importantly, some farmer practices also have been observed which cause losses to farmers themselves. For example, many farmers have cultivated up to the margin of the protected lands without considering the importance of established buffer zones. Crops that elephants favour have been cultivated very close to the electric fence, which provides a certain attraction for the elephants to trespass the fence boundary. These kinds of cultivations are highly vulnerable to destruction. Therefore, it can be mentioned clearly that some farmer actions too have contributed to creating conflict situations.
Some available protection mechanisms require more public participation (effort) and attention for their successive use. As an example, bio-fencing processes may require more public attention. Palmyrah bio-fences are efficient in controlling the elephant trespassing at the park border. However, certain actions like uprooting the young palmyrah trees for use in cattle feed by villagers inhibit the continued usefulness of the fence. Cattle owners usually uproot them at seedling stage ignoring its importance. This wastes public money which was used in the establishing of such bio-fences and those affected once again ask that the government to provide them with compensation instead.
Some plant species attract elephants less with the animals showing an inherent dislike towards them. In this regard, fruit plants like lemon and medicinal plants like Malabar nut (Adhathodavasica) (Pawatta/Adathoda) can be cultivated to discourage elephant trespassing. These plants help to earn a small income while repelling elephants. These actions need more effort and farmer dedication because their success is more farmer-dependent. These additional actions usually remain as unseen components in the big picture.
This information was found by research conducted in the Udawalawe National Park in 2016. Even though the research was carried out in the Udawalawe area, this information and context have a validation to many areas in Sri Lanka where this struggle exists. Moreover, the particular findings fitted with the similar research findings conducted in the African region.
Finally, possible remedial measures and socioeconomic approaches need to be linked with scientific actions like electric fencing. This integration can lead society towards achieving a sustainable solution. For instance, proper compensation mechanisms that include hidden costs are required, as highlighted, to build the resilience of those who are affected.
Further, the climate and weather-related information gap must be filled with suitable research action to forecast possible threats early. Social welfare and economic benefits from the elephants must be distributed equally among all the beneficiaries via proper price mechanisms. Farmer adaptations to avoid elephant threats by cultivating crops that deter elephants should be promoted. Participatory management approaches like the existing Gajamithuro programme must be promoted.

U.S.-South Korea quarrel over trade
U.S. Commerce Ministry announced plans last week to impose high import tariffs, as high as 53 percent, on steel and aluminum products from countries, including South Korea.
Earlier, the U.S. administration decided on January 23 to slap safeguards against washing machines and solar cell imports from countries, including South Korea, by levying high import tariffs on them.
Meanwhile, the bilateral US-South Korea FTA, which took effect in 2012, has been under negotiations to amend as U.S. President Donald Trump called it a horrible deal.
Last Monday South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Monday ordered resolute measures against U.S. protectionist moves in bilateral trade, taking a two-track approach to the trade issue by separating it from security issues.
Regarding unfair trade protectionist actions, (the government) should take confident and resolute measures, such as the filing (of a complaint) with the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the review over whether (the U.S. action) violates the (South) Korea-U.S. free trade agreement (FTA), Moon said.
He also instructed officials to actively point out the unfairness of the U.S. safeguards against South Korean products in negotiations with the United States to revise the South Korea-U.S. free trade pact.
President Trump also hinted at a two-track approach to trade and security issues, saying last week that he will push for a reciprocal tax on countries, including its allies such as South Korea. Trump said the so-called allies were not allies on trade.
During the meeting with his senior aides, Moon stressed the importance of the diversification of his country's trade partners to reduce dependence on the United States in trade.
Moon told his aides that the U.S. import restrictions on South Korean exports, including steel, electronics, solar cell and washing machines were feared to disrupt the country's export that has an international competitiveness.
South Korea's export expanded 15.8 percent in 2017, marking the fastest export growth among the world's top 10 exporting countries. The country's export ranking was raised by two notches to the sixth in the world last year.
Moon ordered a close review and a comprehensive policy package to tackle the recent moves that affect the export of South Korea, while rapidly pushing for innovative growth to improve the country's export competitiveness.
DAVOS calls for reform of market capitalism
Last years Global Risks Report published by the DAVOS World Economic Forum has called for fundamental reforms to market capitalism and a rebuilding of solidarity within and between countries.
The Report says environmental risks have grown in prominence in recent years, with all five risks in the environmental category being ranked higher than average for both likelihood and impact over a 10-year horizon. Characteristics of the preceding year were high-impact hurricanes, extreme temperatures and the first rise in CO2 emissions. It also said that biodiversity is being lost at mass-extinction rates, agricultural systems are under strain and pollution of the air and sea has become an increasingly pressing threat to human health. The situation was worsened by unilateral action of some states which shunned away from multi-national initiatives.
The Report also notes the alarming increase of cyber security threats in which the targets were businesses as well as critical infrastructure and strategic industries.
Geopolitically the world has become more unstable with multi-lateral rule-based approaches deteriorating resulting in military tensions, economic and commercial disruptions, the Report notes with concern.
Elaborating further the Report clarifies, thus: Four related developments stand out as potential sources of disruption over the short and medium term. The intensification of strong-state politics is affecting both large and small states, while global norms are eroding and tensions growing between major powers. These two trends fuel two others: increasingly aggressive geo-economic agendas and the mounting pressures faced by small states.
Refugees defy death seeking greener pastures
A total of 2,583 migrants and refugees have reached Europe by the sea so far in 2018, according to the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM).
In mid-January, the crew of the Dutch NGO boat, Sea Watch 3, saved 165 people on board a rubber vessel north Libya.
Most refugees, who had fled Libya, were trying to reach European shores. They included eight children and 28 women, three of whom were pregnant.
An Italian rescue mission Sea Watch 3 had saved more than 400 people from possible death by drowning or cold.
Tens of thousands of people from Africa and the Middle East leave the Libyan coast for Europe dangerously traversing the Mediterranean Sea defying death.
Reportedly 199 people died attempting to cross the Mediterranean between January 1 and January 17.
Less than half the arrivals, or 1,093 people, were registered in Italy, 847 in Greece and 653 in Spain.

Weight loss linked to healthy eating
Participants who ate the most vegetables and consumed the fewest processed foods, sugary drinks and unhealthy fats shed the most kilograms. The amount and quality of food and not a persons genetics will lead to weight loss, a US study has found.
It has been suggested that variations in genetic makeup make it easier for some people to lose weight than others on certain diets.
To test this theory researchers at Stanford University conducted a randomised control trial involving 609 overweight adults, who all underwent genetic and insulin testing before being randomly assigned to either a low-fat or low-carb diet for 12 months.
Gene analyses identified variations linked with how the body processes fats or carbohydrates. But weight loss averaged around 5kg to 6kg at follow-up regardless of genes, insulin levels or diet type.
What seemed to make a difference was healthy eating, researchers said. Participants who ate the most vegetables and consumed the fewest processed foods, sugary drinks and unhealthy fats lost the most weight.
Prof. Lennert Veerman from the School of Medicine at Griffith University in Queensland said the study showed there was probably no such thing as a diet right for a particular genetic make-up. We eat to fill our stomach and, if thats with vegetables, we tend to lose weight, whereas if its with chocolate or French fries, flushed down with a soda, we gain weight, Veerman said.
The study was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Participants had 22 health education classes during the study and were encouraged to be physically active but the focus was on what they ate.
They were advised to choose high-quality foods but were not given suggested calorie limits nor were they provided with specific foods. Results are based on what they reported eating. Fat intake in the low-fat group averaged 57 grams during the study versus 87 grams beforehand, while carb intake in the low-carb group averaged 132 grams versus 247 grams previously.
Both groups reduced their daily calorie intake by an average of about 500 calories. The leading Australian nutritionist Dr Rosemary Stanton, from the school of medical sciences at the University of New South Wales, said the excellent study highlighted the importance of eating plenty of vegetables.
Stanton advises people to seek professional help to choose quality foods because the macronutrient content of of a diet does not really matter.
Some previous studies that have damned carbohydrates have not taken note of the foods that supplied it, Stanton said. For example, lentils and lollies are both carbs but one is a nutrient-dense high quality food while the other is junk. Simply calling them carbs does not provide this vital distinction,
While most diets worked, the real challenge was sticking with them, Veerman said. Instead of going on a diet it would be better to find new, healthier habits, he said.
