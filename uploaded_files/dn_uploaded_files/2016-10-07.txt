First unofficial test at R Premadasa Stadium : West Indies A fall to spin - face defeat

The touring West Indies A batsmen faltered against spin and faced defeat at the hands of Sri Lanka A in the first 4-day unofficial test played at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Trailing on the first innings by 110 runs, West Indies A ended the third day at 165 for nine wickets in their second innings  an overall lead of 55 runs with one wicket in hand going into the fourth and final day today.
Indications that the pitch was helping the spinners was given by West Indies A off-spinner Rahkeem Cornwall who picked up the remaining two Sri Lanka A first innings wickets to end with career best figures of 8 for 108 off 38 overs.
Sri Lanka A resuming at 348-8 added a further 38 runs to stretch their first innings lead to over 100 with Asela Gunaratne making the main contribution by carrying his overnight score from 15 to 38.
West Indies A suffered a setback to their second innings when they lost opener Keiran Powell in the opening over for a duck and were soon 31-3. They never quite recovered from that poor start and kept on losing wickets at regular intervals as the spinners took a stranglehold on their batting.
Test spinner Lakshan Sandakan with three wickets and Sri Lanka under 19 captain Charith Asalanka with two wickets caused the most damage to the West Indies batting.
Guyanas southpaw Vishaul Singh was once again the most impressive of the West Indies batsmen. He followed his first innings score of 96 with another determined knock of 46 off 111 balls.Another Guyanian left-hander Gudakesh Moti-Kanhai stuck it out for 68 balls to make a defiant 34 to prevent a three-day finish to the match.
