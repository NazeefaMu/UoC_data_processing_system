Phelps aims to go out on a high note
RIO DE JANEIRO, FRIDAY: Once again Michael Phelps leads the mighty United States into battle in the Olympic competition pool, where traditional rivals Australia are just one country with the Americans in their sights.
Phelps, whose record 22 Olympic medals include 18 gold, caps his career with a fifth Games appearance in Rio.
But just as he's far from invulnerable at 31, so the United States could find itself hard-pressed to match their 2012 haul of 16 gold medals, nine silver and six bronze.
Australia, in particular, are aiming to rebound from a shocking London Games -- their first since 1976 without an individual gold.
Australian coach Jacco Verhaeren, however, said the 2016 squad's mission has nothing to do with atonement. I don't think we're here to make up for any disappointment, he said. Nobody is busy with what happened or what might happen. Australia's Cate Campbell arrives in Rio on a high after breaking the long-standing women's 100m freestyle world record in July, while Cameron McEvoy is a gold medal contender in the men's 50m and 100m free.
It's always special to stand up against the Americans, said McEvoy. That mutual respect gets the adrenaline pumping. But swimmers from around the globe are set to challenge the twin powerhouses when eight days of competition kicks off on Saturday.
China will be keen to at least maintain the second place in the swimming medals table they achieved for the first time in London with five golds.
Sun Yang, looking to defend his 2012 gold in the 400m and 1,500m freestyles, heads a Chinese squad that also includes Ning Zetao, 2015 world champion in the men's 100m free and Ye Shiwen, reigning champion and world record-holder in the women's 400m individual medley.
Hagino Kosuke leads the Japanese charge. He's aiming to wrest the 400m individual medley gold from US hands, but he'll have competition in the same event from compatriot Daiya Seto.
South Africa's Chad le Clos -- who bested Phelps in the 200m butterfly in London -- is back to try to hold off a Phelps bent on revenge.
The sport has changed, Phelps said of the need to be wary of challengers from all directions.
Britain boasts medal contenders in freestyler James Guy and breaststroker Adam Peaty and Hungarian Laszlo Cseh tops the world rankings in the 100m butterfly -- one of two events Phelps is trying to win for a fourth straight time. Hungary's Iron Lady Katinka Hosszu is eyeing a medley double -- with perhaps a backstroke or butterfly strike thrown in.
Australia's women are an imposing bunch, but the US have a one-woman wrecking crew in Katie Ledecky.
Still just 19, Ledecky has gone from strength to strength since her surprise 800m freestyle triumph in London. She won 200m 400m, 800m and 1,500m free at last year's world championships and could become the first Olympian to match Debbie Meyers 1968 feat of winning the 200m, 400m and 800m freestyles. AFP

Ranjan Wijerathna MV is a school situated within the Pelawatta sugarcane plantation and the livelihood of most families is farming and providing manual labor. The girls who were well aware of the financial dificulties faced by their families had worked in the sugarcane fields to collect money for their sportswear to attend the championship in Matara. It was with great difficulty that I convinced the parents to permit their children to take part in sports and attend practices. Today the girls enthusiasm and dedication paid dividends. I am lucky to have the fullest support of our principal she added. Lasses from Buttala overcame Buwanekaba MV Maharagama 10/0, Mahinda MV Gettuwana 11/9, Anurudhdha MV Lunuwila 14/8 and Devi Balika MV - Dompe 22/17 to bag the division B crown in Matara.

Daniel and Vithanage frustrate England U19
NORTHAMPTON: Seamers George Panayi and Ed Barnes led an England fightback on the second day of the second Under-19s international against Sri Lanka in Northampton.
While their counties Warwickshire and Yorkshire were squaring up in a Championship match at Headingley, Panayi and Barnes each took three wickets. Gloucestershires George Hankins provided good support with four slip catches - although the tourists still claimed a first-innings lead of 99 thanks to half-centuries from lower-order batsmen Navindu Vithanage and Jehan Daniel.
England then suffered another blow in a gloomy evening session as captain Max Holden, who had carried his bat for 111 in the first innings, was bowled off an inside edge driving at Lahiru Kumara. They will resume on Friday on 24 for 1, still 75 behind.
England needed early wickets when Sri Lanka resumed on 48 for 1 in reply to a below-par total of 208, and after a frustrating start Panayi and Aaron Beard delivered with three in consecutive overs.
Panayi, who signed a professional contract with Warwickshire earlier this year and is one of two Shrewsbury School products in the team with the Worcestershire opener Olly Westbury, had taken the first wicket on Wednesday, and added the important scalp of Sri Lankas captain Charith Asalanka with a good return catch.
Then Beard, who made his first-class debut for Essex earlier this season, had Wanidu Hasaranga edging to Surreys Ollie Pope, who produced a tidy performance in front of the England wicketkeeping coach Bruce French.
When Panayi bowled Shammu Ashan for a duck as he tried to withdraw his bat, Sri Lanka had lost three wickets for six runs and stumbled to 79 for 4.
They recovered with a fifth-wicket stand of 51 before Barnes claimed two wickets in three overs in a fine spell from the Wantage Road end, as first Avishka Fernando, then Ashen Bandara edged into Hankinss safe hands at second slip.
That was 153 for 6, but England were then frustrated by a seventh-wicket stand of 94 between Daniel and Vithanage.
It was finally broken by Amar Virdi, a Surrey offspinner who had a net session with Monty Panesar on Wednesday, as Daniel edged a cut and Hankins claimed his third catch.
Holden confirmed the value of his occasional offspin by taking the eighth wicket in a tidy nine-over spell, and then Beard and Barnes polished off the tail in four overs with the new ball.
Scores:
England U19 : 208 and 24-1 at close
Sri Lanka U19 : 48-1 contd 307 (Avishka Fernando 49, Charith Asalanka 33, Ashen Bandara 25, Navindu Nirmal 80 n.o., Jehan Daniel 52, Thilan Prasan 20, A Beard 2/78, G Panayi 3/51, E Barnes 3/38)

Cook and Hales defy Pakistan
England captain Alastair Cook and Alex Hales's first century stand as an opening pair left the third Test against Pakistan at Edgbaston intriguingly poised come the close of Friday's third day.
At stumps, England were 120 without loss in their second innings, a lead of 17 runs.
Cook was 64 not out and Hales 50 not out, with two days left in the match.
It was the first time in 18 innings as a Test opening pair the duo had posted a century partnership.
England were 103 runs behind on first innings after more than 10 hours in the field.
Yet Hales was soon into his stride with a cover-driven four off left-arm quick Mohammad Amir.
Meanwhile Cook took advantage of width from Sohail Khan with two square-cut boundaries in three balls.
Cook completed a brisk fifty in 67 balls when Rahat Ali's misfield at mid-on saw a drive by the left-hander go for his fifth four of the innings.
Hales took England into the lead with an elegant back-foot forcing shot through the covers off Sohail, who had marked his return to Test cricket by taking five for 96 in the hosts first innings. And the last delivery of the day saw Hales complete a 116-ball fifty with a single off the tiring Sohail.
Pakistan were bowled out for 400 in reply to England's first innings 297 on the stroke of tea.
After Azhar Ali, whose 139 was his first Test century outside of Asia, and recalled 20-year-old opener Sami Aslam (82) put on 181 for the second wicket Thursday, Pakistan saw skipper Misbah-ul-Haq (56) and wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed (46 not out) frustrate England on Friday.
Chris Woakes, in the all-rounder's first Test match on his Warwickshire home ground, led England's attack with three for 79, while fellow paceman Stuart Broad took three for 83.
Pakistan resumed on 257 for three after Azhar had been dismissed off the last ball of Thursday's play.
Younis Khan (21 not out) was joined in the middle by fellow veteran Misbah.
Woakes, who had dismissed Azhar, struck again when he had Younis caught behind for 31 glancing down the legside. It took the patient Misbah 40 balls to score his first boundary Friday.
