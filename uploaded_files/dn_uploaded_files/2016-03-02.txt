Champion swimmer gets IOC/WASA scholarship
The International Olympic Committee and World Aquatic Sports Association has awarded a scholarship worth 10,000 US Dollars to Matthew Abeysinghe for clinching the award for fastest swimmer in South Asia and winning seven gold medals at the recently concluded South Asian Games in Guwahati, India.
The scholarship covers training sessions, sports equipment, coach's allowances, vitamins and nourishment.
The IOC has agreed to grant this scholarship on a special request made by the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka.
Abeysinghe expects to get the maximum out of the scholarship and surpass the qualifying standards for the Rio Olympics in August this year.
He will participate in the Dubai Swimming Championship and Malaysian Swimming Championship in April, and Japan Open Swimming Championship in May to get the much needed foreign exposure. His father cum coach Manoj Abeysinghe said that Matthew had to take part in 11 disciplines with the intention of winning maximum number of medals for the country and the effort he put in deprived him of concentrating on his pet events and gaining the qualifying standards for the Rio Olympics.
Manoj Abeysinghe said that he was grateful to Chairman of the National Olympic Committee Hemasiri Fernando, Secretary Maxwell de Silva and former secretary of the Aquatic Sports Association Akri Ameer for their efforts in obtaining this scholarship for his son.

Consistency is the key for Peterites
St.Peter's College Colombo which started playing cricket in the early 1930s has not only produced several outstanding cricketers but also been a major force in the school cricket scene during the last four decades.
They will be vying for major honours against their arch rivals St.Joseph's College in their 82nd 'Battle of the Saints' encounter which will take place at the P.Sara Oval on Friday and Saturday. The encounter is played for the Rev.Fr. Maurice Le Goc Challenge Trophy.
The Bambalapitiya school has not only produced several champion teams, but also several outstanding cricketers who have represented Sri Lanka with distinction. Clive Inman who holds the individual batting record in the Joe-Pete series with 204 not out in 1954 went onto play county cricket for Leicestershire and for Sri Lanka, wicket-keeper H.I.K. Fernando who represented the national team for several years was once rated as the best wicket- keeper in Asia.
David Heyn who was one of the best cover point fielders also played for Sri Lanka. He is best remembered for the two fine innings against India in an unofficial test in 1975 when he made 105 and 84. He also made a fighting knock of 69 for Sri Lanka in the unofficial test against Garry Sobers West Indies team in 1967. Paceman Tony Opatha, also represented the national team for several years and was instrumental in skittling out the formidable West Indies team for a mere 101 runs at the P Sara Oval in 1975 when he captured four wickets along with D.S.de Silva who also took four wickets.
There was that stylish batsman Roy Dias, who scored a brilliant 77 in the second innings of the inaugural Test against England at the P Sara Oval in 1982. Dias also made a match saving century in the third test against India at Asgiriya in 1985 which helped Sri Lanka to force a draw. Opening batsman and wicket keeper Amal Silva made 102 not out in the second innings of the Lord's Test against England in 1984.
The two pacemen Rumesh Ratnayake and Vinodhan John represented the country in Test cricket in the 1980s. Ratnayake had a remarkable season in 1980-81 for St. Peter's when he captured 111 wickets. Incidentally Ratnayake was the national coach of the Sri Lanka team a few years ago.
In recent years Russell Arnold and Malintha Warnapura played Test cricket for his country. Arnold who scored a superb century in the Asian Test Championship against Pakistan in 1999 is a leading international commentator today.
In 2012, the Peterites emerged victorious in the "Battle of the Saints" against St. Joseph's under the leadership of Shehan Fernando with left-arm leg-spinner Julian de Zilva being the hero with a match bag of 10 wickets for 86 runs. He had an excellent season last year in which he bagged 90 wickets.
This year the Peterites are led by experienced player Vinu Mohotty who is a source of inspiration to his teammates. In the current season, SPC has recorded six outright victories against De Mazenod, President's Kotte, Prince of Wales, DSS, St.Benedict's and Gurukula MV Kelaniya.
Looking at their performances, the Peterites can be satisfied with their consistency. Their batting line-up is powered by four centurions. Lakshina Rodrigo who has scored over 1000 runs has played a key role in Peterites success while Hashan Wanasekara who has scored more than 800 runs including two centuries will be an essential batsman in their batting lineup.
The other key batsmen for St.Peter's are Ranmith Jayasena who scored 650 runs and Santhush Gunatilleke. Manelker de Silva, captain Vinu Mohotty, Inesh Fernando and Anishka Fernando will be the others of whom much is expected.
The Peterites have a strong bowling attack headed by Taneesha Weerakoon who has captured 80 wickets and skipper Mohotty who has claimed over 70 victims.
Sadish Pathiranage, Dinal Jayakody, Ravindu de Silva and Manelker de Silva will lend the support to curtail the Josephian batting line up.

[Reel Reviews]
Enthralling thriller
Although it runs in several layers, the genre of Bhava Tharana is clear. It is a political thriller. A conceptual political thriller, to be more precise. Devinda Kongahage's debute cinematic attempt points us toward the powerful imaginative capacity of the Lankan filmmaker. It is a proper remedy to the recent surge of Buddhist-themed films. The directors of these so called Buddhist-themed films (not to mention in general, though) seem to belittle the audience.
Their job was simply confined to take up a Buddhist tale along with its related events and make it into a film. And such films were forced upon the schooling citizens in the name of Buddhism and culture of this land.
On the contrary, here comes someone who bucks that trend. Devinda Kongahage is yet to establish his name as a seasoned filmmaker. With Bhava Tharana, however, Kongahage treads far ahead the traditional filmmaker of this country.
He employs Buddhism and politics, which are becoming popular subjects in the local art scene. All the same, he is not hesitant to question the Bhikkhu and the politician. He finds an interesting territory in politics and Buddhist culture. And thereby hangs his position: Devinda Kongahage offers a lesson on how ancient sources could be reconstructed and deconstructed.
More than the visual beauty of the film, Kongahage portrays his excellence as a scriptwriter with powerful imagination. He bases his script on 'Kandyan Kingdom: The Secret of its Survival' by Dr Lorna Dewaraja. With that as a source, Kongahage fuses the Buddhist concepts of rebirth and karmic effect with the political turbulences of the pre-colonial era. Unlike most films based on hackneyed Buddhist tales, Bhava Tharana presents us an almost-never-heard-of story that came to pass during the Kandyan era: a conspiracy by Kandyan aristocrats, led by a Buddhist Bhikkhu, against King Kirti Sri Rajasinha who has roots in South India.
At the outset, Bhava Tharanaya delves into the two main traditions of Buddhist monk order: monastic and the urban tradition. In Ven Thibbotuwawe Buddharakkhita Thera's character, we find both traditions infused: a worldlier monk in the previous birth and a meditative monk in the present birth.
In his previous birth, the Thera stands as the protector of Buddhism in its cultural segment. But in his present birth, he observes the futility and impermanence of the worldly affairs.
Devinda's interesting script introduces us to the Kandyan political landscape where politicians acted in much favour of the Buddhist monks - though the kings themselves had South Indian roots. Kongahage pursues his concept through the dialogues between Ven Buddharakkhitha Thera and his closest aristocrat patron. It is universally clear why politicians respect the Buddhist monks. The monk order has strong links with the community. The community would never be hesitant to comply with whatever the members of the Buddhist monk order needs done. Defying a Buddhist monk, a politician would definitely have to fear the public wrath.
That is why King Kirti Sri Rajasinha would not punish the Buddhist monks for being a part of the conspiracy. They were removed from the Sangharaja positions, only to be reinstalled later. This seems a riddle for Dr Dewaraja. Interestingly Devinda has already solved this riddle infusing his concept into the dialogues.
Even during the colonial times, the Buddhist monks could show their power, vigour and mettle. Probably why the politicians' fear and respect for the Buddhist monks continue to exist even at this age.
Kongahage reaches his cinematic pinnacle when he gets rid of lighting, a lavishly used cinematic technique in historic films. Thanks to this strategy, the audience can differentiate the present (which is shot in a moderately colourful ambience) from the past. You would find it a bit hard to see the darkly lit palace of King Kirti Sri Rajasinha. But that alone would creates a mutual bond between you and the Kandyan times.
The narrator we meet in the present layer was a part of his rebirth - he was one of the conspirators. In his sleeps, he naturally evokes memories of one of his previous births. Through a seemingly natural course of events, he is led to the Bhikkhu, who now resides in a forest in meditation. The culmination is that the Bhikkhu understands the futility of his social struggle. And king Kirti Sri Rajasinha comes to meet him in his present birth as a giant tusker.
The deal is over and done with. There are no more grudges or revengeful feelings left among them. What happened has already happened.
And the audience leaves the cinema hall, fully content.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump rack up more wins


Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump have both won the most states in the biggest day of the race for the US presidential nomination.

Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia were among the states where both triumphed. Mr Trump was defeated by Ted Cruz in Texas and Oklahoma.

Democrat Bernie Sanders won four, including his home state of Vermont.

Super Tuesday sees 11 states voting on the biggest single day ahead of the 8 November presidential election.

Super Tuesday states won so far:
Donald Trump (Republican): Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Virginia, Arkansas, Vermont
Ted Cruz (Republican): Texas, Oklahoma
Marco Rubio (Republican): Minnesota
Hillary Clinton (Democrat): Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, Arkansas, Texas, Massachusetts
Bernie Sanders (Democrat): Vermont, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Colorado

The former secretary of state and real estate mogul entered Super Tuesday as the favourites to win the vast majority of states for their respective parties.

In her victory speech on Tuesday, Mrs Clinton appeared to already be looking towards a potential presidential race against Donald Trump, saying: "The stakes in this election have never been higher and the rhetoric we're hearing on the other side has never been lower."

Donald Trump, for his part, insisted that he was a "unifier" who could put internal fighting in the Republican party behind him to focus on a general election race against Mrs Clinton.

"Once we get all this finished, I'm going after one person - Hillary Clinton," he told reporters in Florida, where he has been campaigning ahead of the state's vote later this month.

The billionaire also insisted he had "expanded the Republican party", referring to higher turnout from a broad demographic in states that have already voted.

Texas Senator Ted Cruz called on his rivals to drop out of the race, which he says would enable him to contend Mr Trump's lead more effectively.

Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who was hoping to emerge as the main alternative to Mr Trump, won his first state on Tuesday in the Minnesota caucuses. (BBC)

India enter final by beating Sri Lanka by five wickets
India played themselves into the final defeating the reigning Asia Cuo champions Sri Lanka by five wickets at the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka.
India in pursuit of a realatively easy target of 139 lost five wickets in the process for 142 in 19.2 overs. Virat Kohli top scored with 56 n.o.
Sri Lankas slim chances of entering the final will now squarely wrest on the outcome of the Pakistan versus Bangladesh game today and the result of the Sri Lanka  Pakistan encounter.
Sri Lanka had won only one match in the tournament beating the lowly rated UAE and defeating India to keep their hopes alive to get into the next stage of the contest is a herculean task for a team still struggling to find their bearings to match the Indian mechanism.
After restricting the Lankans for 138 for 6 in their 20 overs, Nuwan Kulasekera struck twice to get rid of Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma cheaply at 16 for 2 in 3.2 overs.
But the indomitable Indian batting line up was unshaken as Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina carried on relentlessly without further mishaps.
The third wicket pair added 54 runs and when Raina drove Shanaka Danushka to Kulasekra when he had reached 21 .
Yuvraj Singh kept company with Kohli scoring 35 . Virat Kohli remained unbeaten on 56 facing 47deliveries with seven fours as India romped home by 5 wickets.
Mathews lost the toss in this all important game for Sri Lanka, both captains preferred to bowl first on a pitch which showed signs good for the fast bowlers. Dinesh Chandimal took the role as the opener joining Dilshan.
The Lankans have been experimenting the opening slot, it was Shehan Jayasuriya in the match against Bangladesh. Left armer Ashish Nehra and Jasprit Bumrah justified their captains decision of bowling first. Both Nehra and Bumrah made the ball to hurry through. Jasprit Bumrah was able to purchase some lift and create some doubts in the batsmens mind.. But it was Ashish Nehra who drew first blood having Chandimal caught behind on the leg side.
Then Jasprit Bumrah got one to rise sharply and Shehan Jayasuriya promoted to number three in the order hung his bat to give Dhoni his second catch.Sri Lankas batting was not convincing at all.
Tillekeratn Dilshan had lost his extravagance and looked a shadow of his past heroics and trying desperately to find his fluency. Dilshan after facing sixteen deliveries and striking two boundaries, trying to swing first change bowler Hardik Pandya was caught by Ashwin in the deep. Sri Lanka were 31 for 3 in 6.1 overs in Pandyans first ball in his first over. Mathews joined Kapugedera who was promoted in the batting order may be to give him more overs to face.
Mathews after adding 24 runs with Kapugedera was beaten and bowled off Hardik Pandya who is turning out to be a fine all-rounder. Boundaries were hard to get , Milinda Siriwardene struck Ravindra Jadeja for a sixand glided one past wicket keeper Dhoni to the fence. Kapugedera and Milinda Siriwardene added 43 runs and posted the 100 run mark. The lower middle order of Thisara Perera with few lusty blows 17 off six deliveries and Nuwan Kulasekera 13 gave some respite to the total while ending the 20 overs at 138 for 9.

India, US closer to pact on sharing military logistics
INDIA/US: India and the United States are closing in on an agreement to share military logistics after 12 years of talks, officials say, a sign of strengthening defence ties between the countries as China becomes increasingly assertive.
The US has emerged as India's top arms source after years of dominance by Russia, and holds more joint exercises with it than any other country.
It is in talks with New Delhi to help build its largest aircraft carrier in the biggest military collaboration to date, a move that will bolster the Indian Navy's strength as China expands its reach in the Indian Ocean.
After years of foot-dragging by previous governments over fears that the logistics agreement would draw India into a binding commitment to support the US in war, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration had signalled a desire to move ahead with the Logistics Support Agreement (LSA)
That would allow the two militaries to use each other's land, air and naval bases for resupply, repair and rest, officials said.
Admiral Harry Harris, head of the US Navy's Pacific Command, said the two sides were working on the LSA, another agreement called the CISMOA for secure communications when the militaries operated together, and a third on the exchange of topographical, nautical and aeronautical data. "We have not gotten to the point of signing them with India, but I think we're close," Admiral Harris, who is due in India this week, told the US House armed services committee on Wednesday.
The progress comes as the countries consider joint maritime patrols.
A US official said these could include the South China Sea, where China was locked in a territorial dispute with Vietnam, the Philippines and Taiwan, among others. However, both sides said there were no immediate plans for such patrols, which drew strong condemnation from Beijing.
An Indian government official said the main impediment to signing the LSA had been cleared, after Washington gave an assurance that New Delhi was not bound by it if the US went to war with a friendly country or undertook any other unilateral action that India did not support.
"It has been clarified that it will be done on a case-to-case basis; it's not automatic that either side will get access to facilities in the case of war," the official familiar with the negotiations said.
India's previous centre-left government was worried the agreements would undermine India's strategic autonomy and that it would draw it into an undeclared military alliance with the US.
Concerns linger over the proposed communications agreement. Some branches of the military, including the air force, feared it would allow the US to access their communications network.
US officials said they hoped that once the logistics agreement was signed, the others would follow.
A US defence industry source engaged in business in India said there were expectations the LSA could be sealed by the time US Defence Secretary Ash Carter visited New Delhi in April.
The source said Mr Modi's office was directly involved in the matter and considering the agreements as a key for enhanced co-operation.
India has been alarmed by Chinese naval forays into the Indian Ocean and its involvement in maritime infrastructure on island nations that it traditionally has considered its backyard.
It has moved to shore up naval forces and build defence ties with Japan and Vietnam, besides the US.
"There is growing convergence between [President Barack] Obama's Asia pivot and Modi's Act East policy," said Saroj Bishoyi, an expert on the proposed India-US collaboration at the government-funded Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses in New Delhi.
"The LSA currently appears to be a doable agreement."

Leonardo finally given an Oscar
The 88th Academy awards was one of most anticipated and talked about events for the 2016 calendar. First of all, it was all about how some of Hollywood's leading A-list actors stayed away from the Oscars for the fact that not a single Black Actor was nominated in any role this year.
The host for this year's award was none other than a black actor - Chris Rock - who took his role to explain the #OscarsSoWhite protests. He added: It's the 88th Academy Awards, which means this no black nominees thing happened 71 other times.
"You got to figure that it happened in the 50s, 60s. One of those years, Sidney Poitier didn't put out a movie. Black people didn't protest, because we had real things to protest at the time. We were too busy being raped and lynched to care about who won best cinematographer. When you're hanging from a tree, it's really hard to care about best documentary short."
He also added that everyone should be given equal opportunities - they want black actors to get the same opportunities as white actors.
So, moving on from that, we move to the night's biggest winners. The actors who received their Oscars did a pretty darn good job in their roles and deserved to take the Golden Man home. I think more than any of the other winners, the wait and anticipation for Leonardo DiCaprio's win was sky rocketing, when Facebook just went mad with GIFs, hashtags, posts and so many wishes and comments after Julianne Moore announced his name.
Some say Leonardo won for all the hype his fans and people created via social media and the Oscar should have gone to some else like Redmayne for his impeccable role as the first ever Transgender Lili Elbe. Even Matt Damon for his role in the Martian, where he is left behind on Mars as his friends think he is dead after a storm separates them. Watching this film, you actually do start to think "how in the world would you survive if you ever do become the only person to live somewhere and rest of humanity is far beyond reach or not there at all". As I am sure, all of you would have watched the Oscars, I won't bore you with anything else, but for the ones who missed it, here's the full list of winners.

Lewis, Manomi win Elephant House F5 Duathlon
Lewis Chalk (01:13.54hours) and Manomi Kumari Bandara (01:33.44hours) won the Elite men's and women's inaugural Spinner Duathlon conducted at the Spinner Sports Centre in Madiwela recently.
Elephant House F5 recently signed on as the main sponsor of the first-ever Sri Lankan Duathalon, a run/cycle/run sporting event held on Valentine's Day. It promoted the need for physical activity for loved ones, with many kids and even families taking part, in addition to top national athletes.
The Duathlon featured over 125 participants of all ages and skill levels, with more than 200 spectators cheering them. This event was organised by WrooM Cycling, and Spinner Cyclist Cafe and Bike Fit Lab.
Elephant House F5 supported Sri Lanka's first-ever Duathlon to encourage an active and healthy lifestyle, with many different communities, and a large number of people, positively influenced to take part in cycling and running.
A Duathlon is a sporting competition that comprises three activities. First running, then cycling and, last, running once again. This event is growing in popularity worldwide since many already know how to cycle and run and can train without specialised equipment or venues. The Elephant House F5-sponsored Duathlon 2016, specifically, featured three major categories: Elite, with 5km of running, 25km of cycling and 5km of running; Amateur, with 2km of running, 10km of cycling and 2km of running; and Kids, with 500m of running, 3km of cycling and 500m of running.
Commenting on this exciting partnership, Ceylon Cold Stores PLC Head of Beverages/John Keells Holdings Vice President Daminda Gamlath said, "As the main sponsor of Duathlon 2016, Elephant House F5 was able to create a solid impact on the event, not only raising awareness about the need to re-hydrate after any sporting activity but also aiding in WrooM's and Spinner's efforts to facilitate an active and healthy lifestyle culture amongst all Sri Lankans."

Rouhani secures more moderate Parliament
IRAN: Iran's President Hassan Rouhani secured a more moderate parliament Monday after elections saw hardliners soundly trumped by reformists while conservatives lost seats and voters implicitly backed the government.
Final results showed seats being shared three ways between Rouhani's reformist and moderate allies, conservatives and independents.
No single group had a decisive share of parliament's 290 seats from Friday's voting, but tallies suggested the president would be able to muster support from key backers and create a working majority.
The returns were shaping up as a strong signal of public support for last year's nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, an agreement steered by Rouhani which saw the lifting of crippling sanctions in January.
Friday's second election -- for the clerical Assembly of Experts -- also produced symbolic gains for Rouhani.
Two renowned hardline ayatollahs lost their seats on the 88-member assembly, a powerful committee that monitors supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's work and will pick the 76-year-old's successor if he dies during its eight-year term.
In contrast, 15 of 16 members of the assembly's list in Tehran headed by Rouhani and his top ally Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a two-term former president, were elected.
Rafsanjani came first and Rouhani third. A push by their supporters, largely on social media, helped eject current assembly chair Mohammad Yazdi and the ultraconservative Mohammad Taghi Mesbah-Yazdi, formerly a close adviser to ex-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
The most dramatic change was the resurgence of the reformists, a political camp largely silenced after a disputed election in 2009 saw Ahmadinejad re-elected.That vote was followed by bloody street protests in which dozens of people were killed in what is widely considered the Islamic republic's darkest hour. Reformists swept the capital, and in an electoral first did so without requiring a second round of voting in any of the 30 seats they secured.
After campaigning as the "List of Hope", a slate of reformist politicians who support the government will regain significant power in parliament and are likely to push for social, cultural and political reforms.
Reformists stayed away from parliamentary elections four years ago in protest at Ahmadinejad's earlier victory, with defeated candidates Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who remain under house arrest, alleging the vote was rigged. Results from other cities also had conservatives losing seats, but they continued to enjoy strong support in rural areas.
The main conservative list secured 103 MPs, reformists and moderates from the List of Hope 95, and Independents 14.
Some 69 constituencies had no clear winner, meaning a second round run-off will be needed in a field that has more conservatives than reformists and moderates.
Many of those conservatives already elected are moderates who backed Rouhani on the nuclear deal and, acutely aware of the public's shifting mood and desire for more openness to the West, are likely to support the government. Such a spirit of cooperation came from Ali Larijani, a conservative and parliament's current speaker, who described the election as "eye-catching" and said it signalled that "a new page had been opened for the country".

US warns citizens about possible collapse of Iraqi dam
IRAQ: The United States warned its citizens to be ready to leave Iraq in the event of what it has said could be a catastrophic collapse of the countrys largest hydro-electric dam near Mosul.
Iraqi officials have sought to play down the risk but Washington urged its citizens to make contingency plans now.
A US security message cited estimates that Mosul, which is northern Iraqs largest city and under control of the Islamic State (IS) terrorists, could be inundated by as much as 70 feet (21 meters) of water within hours of the breach.
Cities downstream on the Tigris River such as Tikrit, Samarra and the Iraqi capital Baghdad could be inundated with smaller, but still significant levels within 24-72 hours.
We have no specific information that indicates when a breach might occur, but out of an abundance of caution, we would like to underscore that prompt evacuation offers the most effective tool to save lives of the hundreds of thousands of people, the security message said.
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Sunday precautions were being taken, but described the likelihood of such a scenario as extremely small.
IS seized the dam in August 2014, raising fears they might blow it up and unleash a wall of water on Mosul and Baghdad that could kill hundreds of thousands. The dam was recaptured two weeks later by Iraqi government forces backed by air strikes from a US-led coalition, but the disruption of maintenance operations has increased the likelihood of a breach.
An Italian company has been awarded a contract to make urgent repairs to the dam, which has suffered from structural flaws since its construction in the 1980s and requires constant grouting to maintain structural integrity.
Iraqs minister of water resources said earlier this month there was only a one in a thousand chance the dam would collapse, and that the solution was to build a new dam or install a deep concrete support wall.

Wettimuny slams past cricket administrators
Former Sri Lanka Test cricketer and interim committee chairman Sidath Wettimuny blamed past elected administrators of Sri Lanka Cricket for the national team's poor performances in international cricket today.
Commenting on Sri Lanka's 23-run loss in the Asia Cup match to Bangladesh at Mirpur on Sunday, Wettimuny said, "I have always said that before long we would lose to Bangladesh. I don't blame the players or anybody at the moment but I blame all the past board elected administrations who for the purpose of a vote never did what has to be done by developing the next level of our cricket.
"We have been basking in the glory of our 1996 World Cup win for way too long and it's hitting us now. This is what successive elected boards never realized that we have to revamp our cricket. We have stayed so long it will take a long time to get out of it as well.
"You can't blame the cricketers because this is what they are exposed to - a certain level. How do you know what the next level is," he questioned.
Sri Lanka who had never lost a T20 international to Bangladesh were restricted 124-8 chasing 148 for victory. The defeat was their eighth in 12 T20 Internationals since winning the World T20 title in 2014.
"It was hard to swallow the defeat against Bangladesh. I am surprised that Sri Lanka are a little below par at the moment. I don't know whether the nature of the wicket is bothering our guys or what.
"Our technical skills in my opinion have deteriorated a lot I don't know whether something is wrong in our system," said Wettimuny, a technically accomplished opening batsman who has the honour of scoring his country's maiden Test century - 157 against Pakistan at Faisalabad in 1982.
"You see how crooked the bats are coming down they are all over. You don't have that sense of confidence. When you watch a player and once he gets in you know he is there for the long haul, but there is no assurance from the present players that they can win a match for you," he said.
"You have to watch one of the club matches and ask yourself is this the competition that is required to compete at that level".
"When other countries are playing at the highest level with their IPL's and BPL's etc. we are found wanting.
"Our only hope is Graham Ford (the head coach) who is good, given a little time would be able to put things right".
"He has a tough task to get Sri Lanka out of this mess that's the only way I see it".
Wettimuny said that for years Cricket Boards have been tampering and pandering to club pressures and never allowed a tournament stronger than the existing ones to take place.
"The clubs are pulling it down. They think because we won the World Cup in 1996 playing club cricket it can still remain the same. They don't realize that everything is changing. Indian cricket today is not what it was 10 years ago. They have come a long way," said Wettimuny.
"The bottom line is, don't look at what is happening today this is a problem which has come from a long time.
"It is the culmination of years of poor vision by the elected committees not realising that the game has to go onto another level. You cannot every day depend on club cricket and think because you won the 1996 World Cup that things are the same. What they don't realize is others have gone on ahead whereas we are trying to hold onto the same old thing and wait. You feel sorry for our cricket," he said.
Wettimuny said the defeat at the hands of Bangladesh had to happen for there to be a public outcry where our cricket is heading.
