2017  Dismal year for Sri Lanka ODI cricket
Five wins and 23 defeats from 29 One-Day International (ODI) matches just about sums up what a dreadful year it has been for Sri Lanka cricket. To find a parallel to such a disastrous international cricket season one has to roll back the years to 1987 when Sri Lanka played a total of 10 ODIs and lost all of them. That was the year they failed to win a single match in a Cricket World Cup. Sri Lanka went through six matches against Pakistan, West Indies and England meeting each country twice in the group stages and were beaten in all of them. There have been other worse years prior to and after that but none as bad as 1987. Those years one might say Sri Lanka were still finding their feet on the world stage and can be excused for their shoddy performance. At the time there were only eight nations playing ODI cricket  Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, West Indies and Zimbabwe compared to today where there are 16.
The only two bright sparks for 2017 was Sri Lanka ending their dismal run of 12 consecutive ODI defeats with an eight-wicket win over India in the first ODI at Dharamsala and former captain Upul Tharanga becoming the third batsmen for the calendar year to reach the 1000-run mark. Despite a shaky year for him where he was twice suspended as captain for slow over rate and eventually the ODI leadership taken away from him and handed to all-rounder Thisara Perera when he (Tharanga) had reservations of travelling to Lahore for the third T20 international against Pakistan, the left-hander who is the most capped ODI player in the present squad with 218 matches did not let such off field matters deter him but continued to pile on the runs for his country and become his countrys most successful batsmen for the year.
At the other end of the stick was the troubled year that Angelo Mathews went through. He was earmarked as a long term captain and everyone was looking forward to seeing him lead the country to the 2019 World Cup. But things didnt pan out as expected.
The crunch started with the resignation of head coach Graham Ford who was contracted till the 2019 World Cup but circumstances led him to quit his post well ahead of time. It is no open secret to say that Ford and Mathews had a good relationship going as captain and coach and when the former decided to move out Mathews confidence as captain took an unexpected body blow. The home ODI series defeat to Zimbabwe (the first suffered by Sri Lanka against them) was the last straw for Mathews who threw in the towel and resigned from the captaincy across all formats.
This sudden move by Mathews caught Sri Lanka Cricket unawares and had them struggling to find suitable successors to lead the team in the three formats. How big an impact it had on the leadership can be gauged by the fact that the ODI side for the year was captained by no less than five players  Mathews, Tharanga, Chamara Kapugedera, Lasith Malinga and finally Thisara Perera the present captain.
While this musical chairs was going on with the captaincy Sri Lanka in the mean time was being pounded mercilessly by South Africa, India and Pakistan suffering 5-0 humiliations against each nation. Interference in selections and selection bungles coupled with the unfitness of players contributed largely to the substandard performances on the field especially the fielding and catching which to say the least was appalling. Sri Lanka was once a proud nation who could boast as being one of the best fielding sides in the world but were now putting up a performance as a team of novices.
With things going from bad to worse it took a while for the hierarchy of Sri Lanka Cricket to realize that the path they were treading on was the wrong one and if they were to successfully serve another term in office drastic changes and moves needed to be made to address the situation at hand.
With a new selection committee under former Sri Lanka fast bowler Graeme Labrooy coming into place in September things have gradually started to fall into place. The players unlike before have been given the confidence that they wont be dropped after a match or two but given a decent run of two to three series before their performances are assessed. With that confidence behind them the team has now started to show some positive results that led to the chief selector making the remark: From the Indian tour in Sri Lanka and then the Pakistan tour we see light at the end of the tunnel, there is an improvement but still to decide. If you take a comparison with the Pakistan and Indian ODIs our guys played more competitive and positive cricket. Although we didnt come on top in both series we performed better. The side looks that they believe in themselves, they think that they can win and beat the best side in the world. They got that belief and play more positive cricket. In the Pakistan series they were too much on the back foot all the time.
With another former Sri Lanka cricketer Chandika Hathurusingha taking over Fords position as head coach there is an air of expectancy that things will finally fall into place and Sri Lanka will be back to winning ways. Lets keep our fingers crossed.

From crisis to resilience - Part 8
Are you sure your star performers  are not searching for greener pastures
How do you keep good talent on your team This is a difficult question for any manager. If a team member is really good at his or her job, it is not just known within the company  the competition likely knows it, too. When things get uncomfortable for that employee or the grass starts to look greener outside, you might run the risk of losing that great employee. With workforce management in place, however, you will be better equipped to create an environment in which these individuals can thrive.
Ten strategies
Here are the top ten retention strategies that will minimize the likelihood of someone being wooed away by a competitive industry.
1. Believe in them: The thoughts in your brain are much more powerful than you imagine. If you believe in an employee's potential, it will impact your body language, speech, eye contact, and decisions. But if you harbour doubts about whether they will make it, you virtually ensure their failure. If you manage a team, you better believe in each member.
2. Demonstrate belief by listening: There is no better way to empower another person than to listen carefully and fully to their words. By taking the time to set aside your own thoughts and agenda, you tell that person, You are very important to me. One other reason why listening works so well: very few people do it anymore.
3. Share both your weaknesses and strengths: When a leader is honest about his or her capabilities - both good and bad - it encourages team members to adopt the same attitude. The biggest strength is knowing your own weaknesses, because it allows you to partner effectively with people whose expertise is a good complement to your own.
4. Understand your own biases: We all like to think we are objective and open-minded, but that is sheer nonsense. Each of us has certain attitudes and biases that prevent us from seeing the truth. The better we understand them, the better we can make adjustments. For example, if you tend to be a planner, you might think that an employee behaves rashly because she invests little time in planning; but the reality may be that she is better than you at thinking or her feet.
5. Be simple and clear: The biggest reason why employees don't follow their leader is because they don't understand what the leader wants. I have seen hundreds of teams that were literally baffled by their leaders, whose direction was too contradictory, complex or confusing. Slow down, simplify your direction as much as possible, and repeat it again and again.
6. Inspire, do not intimidate: Very few people work well under extreme pressure. If your team is in a do it or else situation, the odds are that you have already failed as a manager. It is far wiser to inspire with positive messages than to whip teams into action with threats. Keep this rule of thumb in mind... the more you rely on intimidation, the more likely you are to fail.
7. Invest a lot in training: At many companies, training is a joke. It either doesn't happen, or it is lame beyond belief. You can avoid this trap by rewarding people for finding the training that matters most to them. Pay for them to take college, executive education and/or online courses. Consider increasing their compensation in recognition of the training programs they complete. As they pick up important new skills, promote them and offer them expanded responsibilities. Beware this trap: don't limit training to skills that are directly related to their current position. Pay for any sort of training they wish to take.
8. Praise effort, not ability: If you haven't already, read Carol Dweck's fantastic book, Mindset. Foster a growth mindset in your team members, and help them discover that with enough effort, they can accomplish amazing things.
9. Spread credit fairly: When you take all the credit, you eliminate a prime motivational technique. Giving credit to others is a wonderful way to inspire and thank them. The more you give credit, the more impressive a manager you will be.
10. Send your team members on to bigger and better assignments: Some leaders hold onto their employees too tightly. A better strategy is to actively seek out opportunities for your team members, so that you establish a tradition that people who work for you ultimately have enormously successful careers. McKinsey, the top-tier consulting firm, has done a fantastic job of building a stellar alumni network; do the same.
Does your current leadership strategy include a major strategic focus on attraction, training and retention If you are focused on it are you factoring in the demographic realities affecting the market If the answers for either question or both questions are no, talk with higher management and find solutions.
High performance culture
Utopia for business owners is when employees are driven, engaged, skilled, fairly compensated and successful. It is when workers unite as a team in shared values and behaviours and the productivity and value of individual employees is maximized, resulting in a collective boost to company performance.
This might sound straightforward but in order to build a high-performance culture, businesses need to identify the types of workers they are dealing with and implement talent development plans that engage those employee types accordingly.
Star performers
To be truly successful, an organization needs to be able to identify its star performers. Generally, they are the top 15% to 20% of employees, those who produce quantifiable results that regularly exceed expectations. This group is likely to yield an organizations future leaders. It is critical these employees are first retained and then motivated and developed into leadership roles.
Business leaders need to acknowledge the value of their star performers to the business, share company objectives and strategy and compensate them fairly for their contributions. They should also make certain that top management understand their paths for career advancement. This means ensuring they have the development tools and learning resources they need to achieve success.
Through mentoring or rotational assignments, HR or senior executives can give star employees visibility in other parts of the organization. No single manager should hoard their valuable resources. After all, despite their current successes, star performers might have undiscovered potential.
Median lot
Generally considered to be the middle 70% to 75% of the employee population, standard contributors are vital to the business. Without their steady efforts, most companies would not survive long.
The primary objective with this group should be to identify skills gaps and develop competencies in order to increase performance and productivity. Business leaders should direct these workers to hone their skills and look for new areas where their contributions can help meet organizational demands.
They need to start by identifying practical ways to get the most out of these employees. What are their performance goals Can these be better aligned to company objectives
In short-term plans, business leaders need to consider how they will expand the roles of these employees to fully engage them and grow their potential. They should then confirm career paths for these workers as the year progresses.
The long-term plan should be to conduct ongoing evaluations to ensure these employees are in the right roles for their skillsets. While an employee may be underdeveloped for their current position, they could have the necessary skills for greater productivity elsewhere in the organization.
Bottom few
Businesses need to figure out why this group - typically the bottom 10% of an organizations workforce - is underperforming and fix the problems quickly.
The immediate priority will often be to implement Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs) that help employees better define goals and focus their activities. Companies should clearly communicate expectations, so workers know precisely what they need to do to succeed. Performance issues need to be identified and addressed proactively.
In the intermediate term, poor-performing employees should be given the opportunity to develop the skills necessary to meet expectations in their current positions. This means providing appropriate training and ensuring relevant resources are available. Regular progress checks should be conducted. If the desired results are not being seen, the next step is to explore other options.
Are there other roles in the company that provide a better fit for the individual and the organization Ultimately, poor performers should not be allowed to stagnate. If they become a detriment to team morale or productivity, the business should cut its losses and part ways.
Culture
Talent development can be an intricate process when you consider the variety of workers most businesses employ. Some individuals shine naturally, while others require significant hands-on management. And some employees seem to perform only what is asked of them, without a drive to extend their skills for the good of the company.
If managers want to encourage a high-performance culture, however, they must work to pull their workforce together by segmenting employee groups and then managing them accordingly. Overall, the objective will be to leverage a unified approach to talent development - one that includes learning, performance, and compensation management - to maximize the productivity and value of each individual. Not only will the employees feel more loyal and engaged, but the business will benefit too.

Aviation fuel standards good, passes test - CPC
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) yesterday, asked the public not to be swayed by false rumours over low quality aviation fuel and assured that it maintained the highest standards in supplying aviation fuel.
In the last couple of days, there had been an unexpected demand in aviation fuel, causing uncertainty whether we could maintain secure fuel stocks.
The issue was discussed at the Stock Assessment meeting on November 28 and accordingly, it was decided that we would purchase 14,000 metric tonnes of aviation fuel from the Lanka OIC company to maintain adequate stocks, the CPC said in a media release.
They further explained that a ship carrying additional stocks arrived at the Colombo Port on December 10.
The first sample testing of the fuel revealed that it was not up to standard. It was believed that rust from the ship might have contaminated the fuel sample.
Thereafter, in keeping with CPC procedure, a second sample was tested on December 17 with the involvement of an independent observer. The second sample passed the test. By that time, the rust had settled in the ship. Thus the fuel which met all standards is currently being unloaded into the country.
The CPC would like to stress that the fuel received thus is of the highest of standards and that as a company it was responsible to supply aviation fuel which meets all necessary standards.
Rumours are being spread to cause unrest in the country, we request the public not believe such false information, said the CPC.

Dudley Senanayake government refused to surrender the national pride to a pot of rice
BMICH AND CHINA PHOBIA 50 YEARS AGO
During Sirimavo Bandaranaikes 1960-64 rule, the Chinese Communist leaders decided to donate an International Conference Hall to commemorate its close ties with SWRD Bandaranaike who initiated diplomatic relations with Communist nation in 1957. However, the PM could not finalise the matter with Chinese when her government collapsed unexpectedly in 1964. The UNP led coalition entered the fray in March 1965 general elections. One of the main themes on propaganda was an impending threat caused by a Chinese invasion. The Chinese men that visited the island for their preliminary work in the construction of BMICH, toured many parts of the island on sight-seeing. As there were no Chinese tourists then, this became an unusual sight causing anxiety further instigated by the opposition.
A general consensus was built up among the villages that the Chinese were on a covertly move in preparation for take-over of the nation with the help of SLFPers. The UNP was back in power. They stopped the work-in-progress on BMICH by China causing a dilution of relations between the two nations.
Red-Guard Mao badges
Red Guards was a movement of radical Chinese youth who wore Mao badges and stimulated trouble both in China and in countries such as Burma. On August 10, 1965, a consignment of red-guard badges with Maos image and addressed to the Chinese embassy was held by customs when an alert officer suspected the parcel to contain something special. They informed the Foreign Affairs Ministry, who initiated an investigation.
The Communist party of Sri Lanka was in the throes of its own ideological differences based on the rift between Russia and China while Sri Lanka remained strictly neutral. They developed and enjoyed a special relationship with Peoples Republic of China, under Sirimavo Bandaranaike in the early 1960s, but this did not persuade her into support of China during the Indo-China war in 1962.
A group of young Peking Reds (Communist Partys break-away China-wing supporters) led by N. Shanmugadasan visited Jaffna on August 12, 1965. S. D. Bandaranayake MP, the former SLFPer-turned China sympathiser travelled to the North too: they were on a mission to quell caste riots that erupted at a Hindu temple. Jaffna Police was asked to be on alert as the intelligence had reservations on the timing of the move.
The government in the meantime ordered that only Ministry of Defence could make decisions on visas for Chinese arriving or already domiciled here having come before 1948.
PM Chou warned us: Do not rifle with 700 million Chinese"
The Chinese Mission in Colombo on August 14, issued a strongly worded vituperative note to the government. It accused them of working in connivance with anti-Chinese elements and committing acts of robbery and sabotage of export goods and diplomatic articles of the embassy on board the time-chartered ship, the Aionnis. It added that The Ministry had gone to the extent of flagrantly holding up the badges with the profile of Chairman Mao and had not released them for more than a month. As number of vicious elements conducted a robbery; the Captain of the ship demanded protection from police of the port. The note threatened the Sri Lankans, Do not rifle with 700 million Chinese.
The Chinese note spoke of Ceylons grave violation of international practice. As our main supplier of rice here the Chinese held the whip-hand the Dudley Senanayake government was not prepared to surrender the national pride to a pot of rice.
Earlier the Immigration Department handled these matters. The decision was based on intelligence reports that a massive built up of Communist Chinese in the country and that a large spy-ring was in operation. It was a deliberate faux pas by intelligence men close to government politicians. The Defence Ministry ordered an investigation of all stateless Chinese residing here working as dental technicians. Meanwhile, it was reported that Red Guards in Peking had assembled opposite Sri Lankan embassy demonstrated shouting anti-Lankan slogans and even pelted stones at the office, for Chinese soldiers to cordon off the area.
The Government realised that in the recent past Chinese have sent parallel threatening notes to countries like Burma, Indonesia, India, and Japan; therefore it decided to play it cool in keeping with the pattern of her new foreign policy. The Cabinet discussed the threats; one factor that weighed heavily in the minds of ministers was the various trade agreements that were in operation with China. Robert Gunawardene, the Ambassador to Peking was present at these meetings. The ministry announced that it was planning to issue a full statement on August 17, clarifying the position. Some literary books containing selected works of Mao were held back too.
Lakshman Kadirgamar on China
Unveiling the bust of the late PM Chou en Lai at the BMICH on April 9, 2005, Sri Lankas most talented Foreign Minister, Lakshman Kadirgamar said, When a relationship is based on mutual respect and affection, the size, importance and power of one of the two countries in that relationship does not have a disproportionate influence on the other. China has never sought to influence the domestic politics of Sri Lanka. Over the years China has proved to be benign and sincere with no ulterior motives for befriending Sri Lanka. She has never tried to dominate, undermine or destabilize Sri Lanka.
The minister continued, She has come to our rescue with timely assistance on several occasions when there were threats to Sri Lankas national security and territorial integrity. There have been no strings attached to Chinese aid. When a relationship between two countries is not based on dependence, it is strengthened by the fact that it is based on the mutual recognition of equality. Sri Lanka in its own way has been helpful to China. The rubber-rice pact of 1951 has been referred to.
The late Lakshman Kadirgamar said, In more recent times, Sri Lanka has in a modest way been of assistance to China in international fora; especially in the field of human rights where Sri Lanka, taking the view that China was being unfairly treated in certain quarters, has been her steadfast ally. It is good for a relationship when both countries are able to contribute something towards sustaining and enhancing it. Sri Lanka has remained steadfast and unequivocal in respect of its One China Policy.
BMICH, a work of art is a spectacular testimony to the closeness between the people of Sri Lanka and China. Speaking on May 18, 1973, at the opening of BMICH, Sirimavo said, When I rather hesitantly expressed my desire to have an international conference hall, the Chinese Prime Minister Chou en Lai said, "Yes, I would be very glad to gift a hall in memory of my late friend. Only, I ask of you that you should name it after him".

Bridges and Bridge Management in Sri Lanka
There are 4,800 bridges on National Highway Network (A & B class roads) in Sri Lanka. It is important to implement strategic maintenance plan to ensure the sustainability of the large number of existing bridges in order to provide uninterrupted traffic flow for a long time. It is understood that all road infrastructure components deteriorate with time due to the natural and artificial influences. However, it appears that the importance of maintenance and management of bridges has been overlooked for a long time in Sri Lanka.
The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has been working with the Road Development Authority (RDA) from 2015 on The Project for Capacity Development on Bridge Management (herein after referred as the Project) below is brief explanation about the concept of this project and some areas related to bridge maintenance under the project.
As the economy grows and income of people rises, more people desire to have their own private vehicles to commute for their needs. Inadequate road infrastructure to accommodate the increasing volume of vehicles and insufficient traffic control measures lead to traffic congestion on roads resulting in loss of resources. At present there are over 6.5 million vehicles registered in Sri Lanka and more than 70% comprised of motorcycles and three wheelers. There are nearly 3.4 million of motorcycles and around 1.2 million three wheelers in the country. There had been a steep rise in the private vehicle usage in the recent past. The slow movement of vehicles on the roads and emission of smoke mixed with obnoxious gasses harm the environment and health of the people. It is estimated that nearly 500,000 vehicles enter Colombo city daily. (Source: Deputy Minister of Public Enterprise Development, Mr. Eran Wickramarathne, during the Colombo Mayors Conference on December 13, 2015)
Usage of public transport should be highly encouraged and some restrictions for private vehicles to enter the city during rush hours need to be considered.
The road network has been developed throughout the island since 19th Century by the Public Works Department (PWD). Some bridges constructed on National Highways are over 100-years-old. Although they are very old, a large number of those bridges are in good condition, still functioning and supporting the national transportation system. On the other hand, some bridges which are less than 20-years-old, are in very unfortunate condition. What could be the reason This is a question to be solved immediately.
The maintenance of bridges is very important, but the problem is how to do it systematically to achieve expected outcome.
RDA and BM &AU
The development and maintenance of roads and bridges are the main tasks of RDA. They are responsible for providing efficient road network to the public. To perform the tasks entrusted to RDA, the organisation have established separate divisions to implement the relevant tasks.
As an example, Engineering Services Division is responsible for design of bridges, Maintenance and Management Division is responsible for maintenance of roads and bridges, and Planning Division is responsible for project formulation including prioritization of requirements and of budgetary arrangements.
RDA operates with a very comprehensive management structure comprised with Provincial Directors under the Maintenance & Management Division of the RDA. The Chief Engineers offices and Executive Engineers offices are managed under the purview of each Provincial Director. Number of Executive Engineers offices located throughout the island is 52 and these Executive Engineers are functioning under the supervision of the respective Chief Engineers.
And Chief Engineers report directly to the Provincial Directors. All engineers involve in road and bridge construction and maintenance activities depending on the magnitude and level of responsibility in addition to their other duties. The lack of engineers assigned for maintenance of bridges is a constraint to monitor the condition of bridges.
For the successful maintenance of bridges, knowledge on bridge structures and experience in construction supervision are essential attributes.
Bridge Assessment Unit (BAU) was established in the RDA about 25 years ago for the inspection of bridges and maintenance purposes. After few years from the establishment, BAU was closed down due to the shortage of staff and no division had been made responsible for maintenance of bridges since then, till February 2015, when it was re-established and re-designated as BM & AU at the commencement of this Project funded by JICA.
BM&AU function with a head office and 9 regional offices. It is responsible for inspection, maintenance and repairs of bridges. Capacity building is an essential function of the BM&AU by providing required training for other Engineers in RDA to acquire necessary skills and knowledge in maintenance of bridges.
The task of inspection approximately 1,500 bridges in three Provinces (Western, Central, Southern) has already been completed by end of 2016.
Based on the results of bridge inspection and diagnosis conducted in the three Provinces, it has been identified that more than 10% of bridges are seriously damaged or in a weak condition.
Inspection of bridges in other districts is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2017.
Issues pertaining to bridges and maintenance of bridges in Sri Lanka are detailed below.
- In Sri Lanka, there are few long span bridges. Bridges of length less than 10m account for 60% of all bridges. Only 10 % of bridges are 30 m or more in length.
- Reinforced concrete (RC) bridges account for 60 % while steel bridges and Pre-stressed (PC) bridges constitute 20% and 17 % respectively, 3% is considered as other types of bridges.
- The Inspection was difficult due to the lower head clearance of some bridges located in Colombo and some coastal areas. Damage due to the effect of salt is observed in bridges in coastal areas and this seems to be a critical problem which needs to be addressed with correct remedial measures.
- Many steel bridges are heavily corroded due to poor maintenance for long periods even application of paint has not been carried out regularly
- RDA should have condition report for all bridges, because these data can be a strong base for public asset management.
- Engineers attached to RDA will develop the concept of bridge asset management based on the accurate information on bridges gathered during bridge inspections by the Project and could share the relevant bridge maintenance information with other engineers and technical staff in RDA. This will be a good approach for sustaining the proper bridge maintenance system in RDA.
JICA project and bridge inspection vehicle
In Japan, bridge maintenance and reconstruction of bridges is a serious issue. During the period of high economic growth in 1960-1970, many bridges were constructed. Currently most of them have reached 50 years of existence. Amount of maintenance cost is rapidly increasing.
Under technical cooperation of JICA, bridge maintenance projects were conducted in many countries based on bridge maintenance experiences in Japan. Government of Japan and JICA have recognized the requirement of providing necessary equipment and technical cooperation support to develop the bridge maintenance strategies in Sri Lanka. Consequently, the project was initiated in 2015.
A Bridge Inspection Vehicle is procured through the Project. The bridge Inspection vehicle is a vital requirement for the Project due to the status of most of bridges in Sri Lanka. Bridge Inspection Vehicle is a special kind of truck with a bucket, which allows the inspector to reach the underneath of the bridge. This is unique and useful machinery for bridge inspection work.
Bridge maintenance work entails bridge inspection, bridge repair and maintenance. A series of maintenance work is called Bridge Maintenance Cycle.
After the collection of all data from the bridge, total management condition of the bridge should be assessed.
There are two methods of bridge management. They are Preventive Measure and Proactive Measure.
Proactive Measure means action triggers when the problem has been observed in a particular bridge.
Preventive measure means taking precautions at the beginning to avoid the occurrence of such unfavourable conditions.
Based on accurate inspection results, RDA should choose and decide the appropriate method of maintenance and management of bridges.

## Title: Cabinet proposal on Sampur, Norochcholai coal power plants postponed
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Local

Cabinet proposal on Sampur, Norochcholai coal power plants postponed
The Cabinet proposal to build two new coal power plants in Sampur and Norochcholai which could supply a total of 1200MW has been postponed for the second week in a row.
Power and Energy Ministry Secretary Suren Batagoda speaking to Daily News noted that it would be taken up once again when Cabinet reconvenes next, after the New Year in January.
Coal power plants have been a controversial topic in the country for both its environmental as well as social impacts. The Indian proposed coal power plant, Sampur too was cancelled by President Sirisena last year citing environmental and social concerns.
Batagoda however stressed that the government was not completely opposed to coal and that its policy was more aligned with clean coal.
We have two impacts to consider when it comes to coal; local and global. Coal plants if not managed properly can release ash, sulphur and other particles to the surrounding. But Coal power plants when managed well, can significantly reduce such emissions. We have now dealt with this problem in Norochcholai. The installation of an electrostatic precipitator has removed ash, sulphur and other particulate emissions, he said.
When it comes to the global, Batagoda explained that the Paris Agreement only called for a four percent reduction in fossil fuel use but Sri Lanka had voluntarily agreed to a 50 percent reduction. Given that Sri Lanka had a carbon emission of 0.78 metric tons per capita and close to 70 percent of its energy mix was hydropower, Batagoda believed that an additional coal power plant or two would make no difference to our international commitments.
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) however has already approved the 2017-2038 Long Term Generation Plan and has opined that they were strongly against coal. Any new power plants would need their approval.
They PUCSLs premise is that LNG is cheaper than coal and thus we should go for that. But we already have four LNGs in the pipeline, if we go for more, instabilities in world LNG prices will greatly affect us,Batagoda added.
The four LNG plants; one built by China (400MW), one by Japan (500MW), one by India (500MW) and another to be opened for tender (300MW) are expected to be completed by 2020.
We hope to get a coal power plant built by 2025,Batagoda said.
Environmental groups however have strongly objected to the proposals for coal power plants. They point out that continuing to invest in coal would take Sri Lanka a long step back in a world fast progressing past coal.
The term clean coal they further added was a misnomer without a scientific definition.
The term clean coal implies higher technologies in coal processing that removes carbon emissions, although in reality the term is merely subterfuge created and popularized by the coal industry itself, in response to anti-coal litigation. To the best of available knowledge and scientific research, CCS and other technologies that clean coal implies are still underdeveloped, and this seriously undermines the possibility that coal power plants in Sri Lanka will be clean. SO2, NO, Lead, Mercury and Cadmium are some of the non-carbon pollutants of coal power, and the technology for containing these is also at a nascent stage. Furthermore, highly efficient coal plants will still have higher carbon emissions than more environmentally friendly generation methods that the energy mix could include. Including new coal in our future energy mix for the sake of diversification is unjustified and only further reinforces our climate change risks and threatens our national climate action programme, they said in a release to the media.

CCS organises blood donation campaign themed Give the gift of life
A blood donation camp under theme Give the gift of life, organized by the Rotaract Club of the College of Chemical Sciences (CCS) and the Rotaract Club of Katugastota Region, was held recently, with the collaboration of the blood bank of the Peradeniya hospital.
Volunteers, including youth, were present at St. Anthonys Cathedral in Kandy to be a part of the camp. The project was chaired by Rtr. Haneen Packeerally and Rtr. Buwaneka Wijetunge.
The helpful and friendly team of nurses, doctor and public health inspector ensured volunteers were screened and were physically fit to donate. According to the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) of Sri Lanka, an individual is deemed eligible to donate blood if he/she is between 18 and 60 years of age, free from serious ailments and should have a minimum haemoglobin level of 12g/dL . Regular donors should allow a four month lapse between consecutive donations.
Members of both clubs distributed leaflets across Kandy to spread the word prior to the project. In addition, the Rotaract Club of CCS distributed registration forms for their eye donation project Be the light, a collaborative effort with the Sri Lankan eye donation society.
The project was a success, with the combined effort of the presidents, Rtr. Dilendra Nilupuli Wijesekara and Rtr Usama Liyaudeen and their hardworking boards. Our heartfelt gratitude is extended to all volunteers for selflessly giving the gift of life to those in need. We also thank the members of the Rotaract Club of Kandy for their presence.

Certain types of drug prices increased - Rajitha
Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne stated that the prices of 48 types of drugs have been raised only by five percent to prevent local importers from incurring losses due to the continuously rising prices of medicine in the global market.
According to Minister Senaratne, the prices were raised in accordance with a request made by local pharmaceutical companies that import drugs.
The importers are incurring loss due to the price increase of drugs in the global market.
The price increase will be valid for a year and hereafter there will be no price increase again even the prices of drugs in the global market. The prices of 48 drugs reduced significantly on October 21 in 2016 (one year and two months ago), he said.
Earlier, the price of a paracetamol tablet was Rs. 1.30 and now it is only Rs. 1.37 (only seven cents increased). All pharmacies should sell the drugs according to the prices stipulated in the Special Gazette Notification 2049/31 of December 14. The National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) will conduct raids to nab pharmacy owners which sell drugs at higher prices than gazetted, he added.

A Christmas Carol
The first edition of A Christmas Carol by Dickens appeared in December 1843. Six thousand copies were made and sold in five days. The first edition was prized at five shillings which meant Dickens profit was marginal. The illustrations were by his friend the Punch cartoonist John Leech. Dickens came from a middle class family. His father had debts and was imprisoned in a debtors prison forcing Dickens to work at the age of 12.
The story of A Christmas Carol" begins on Christmas Eve in London seven years after the death of Jacob Marley the business partner of the miser Ebenezer Scrooge. Alone at home on Christmas Eve, Scrooge is visited by the ghost of Marley who had wondered the earth entwined by heavy chains and money boxes stolen during a life time of depredation, fraud and theft. He tells Scrooge that he has one chance to avoid the same fate. He will be visited by three spirits from the underworld and he must listen to them or Scrooge will suffer the same fate.
In life Jacob Marley and Ebenezer Scrooge owned the firm Scrooge and Marley for the sole purpose of ripping off the clients. Modern day scholars, pointing at the Jewish sounding names Dickens often picked for the congenital liars and rogues, accuse Dickens of anti-semitism.
Punch was one of the popular magazines on the long tables of the Josephian library. Devotees like myself scrambled to get hold of the single copy. I was caught not at morning prayers in the chapel presided over by the Rector Fr Peter Pillai by Fr Arthur Nicholas Fernando in charge of discipline, but reading the Punch and disciplined. The event took place a week before the Christmas holidays. So many Christmases later I still believe seeing the agony in the re-print of the sketch of the miser Ebenezer Scrooge cringing in front of the ghost of the scoundrel Jacob Marley outweighed the canning I received for cutting prayers.
We were so enamoured then with fleeting things we strained at gnats and swallowed camels, Mathew verse 23, Chapter 24. Sadly, the Punch we enjoyed so much is now out of print.

Daughter will eat her dead mum for Christmas
In another bizarre case of love gone horribly wrong, a grieving daughter has ensured she will be with her late mum on Christmas day, because she plans to scatter her ashes on the turkey.
Debra Parsons, 41, has been eating her mum Doreens ashes since she died in May because she wants to feel as close as possible to her deceased mother.
Now, it turns out that her cravings has got even stronger with Christmas and she plans to dust the turkey and Christmas pudding with her mums remains.
Speaking to Sunday Mirror she said that the ritual will be the only thing that would get her through her first Christmas with her beloved mum.
She went on to say, People might think Im mad or that its not a very respectful thing to do but I just cant stop myself. I feel like she can live on by being inside of me because if she is part of me she can breathe through my body. My breath is her breath.
It turns out that Doreen passed away suddenly from an airway obstruction after suffering a chest infection in May leaving Debra distraught.
She was given her share of the ashes two months later by her sisters, who are unaware of what Debra has been doing to them. While originally she kept them in a sandwich bag and carried her mum to bed and around the house, she suddenly developed the urge one day.
Debra said, I opened the box and licked my fingers and just dipped them into the powder. Before I knew what I was doing they were in my mouth and the chalky, salty taste was comforting. I felt confused by what I had done to begin with but the feeling of comfort and closeness it brought was the first bit of solace Id had since her death.
But with Christmas just around the corner, Debra wants to move on from tasting her mum with her finger or on a little spoon.
Debra wants Doreen to be a part of the celebration and is even planning to prop up the Christmas lunch table with a photo of her mum as well.

Defence rentals cost Rs. 5 bn yearly
The abrupt and unplanned decision taken by the previous regime to remove the Defence Headquarters from Colombo has cost an annual rent of Rs. 5 bn for 15 buildings, the defence forces are occupying at present.
Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe who was speaking at a press brief held at the SLFP headquarters yesterday evening, said President Maithripala Sirisena had revealed this to the Cabinet, at the recently held weekly Cabinet meeting.
President Sirisena, Samarasinghe said has observed that a proper procedure should have been followed when removing the headquarters, from which the military forces could have avoided having to pay large sums of money as rental for 15 buildings they occupy temporarily. The hasty decision to remove the Defence Headquarters from Colombo is a probe worthy matter, Minister Samarasinghe also said.
He said that several Cabinet ministers have requested President Sirisena to appoint a Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate into similar anomalous decisions taken by the previous regime causing large financial losses to the public.
Minister Samarasinghe also pointed out that the project to relocate the Defence Headquarters to Akuregoda in Battaramulla is temporarily suspended since there is an ongoing investigation over financial irregularities relating to this project as well. The US$ 125 mn earned from the land sold to Shangri-La Hotels by the previous regime was deposited in a special account in the Central Bank to build the Pentagon style Defence Headquarters building at Battaramulla.
Minister Samarasinghe pointed out that the said plot of land was not leased out, but was sold to Shangri-La Hotels by the previous regime.
It is important to probe as to why the decision to remove the Defence Headquarters from Colombo was so sudden. This was a serious decision to make.
The Defence Headquarters provided much needed security to the Colombo city as well. In a situation like that, it is important to find out why such a hasty decision was taken to remove the Defence Headquarters in this manner, Minister Samarasinghe said.
Minister Samarasinghe went on to say that the President will nominate a representative for each district to collect evidence against SLFP members supporting other political parties.
Now the military forces occupy 15 buildings which are situated at different locations. Earlier all these divisions were together.
The Military also has to pay a large amount of money as rental for these buildings as well. We believe it is important that we probe into this matter, he also said.
Meanwhile, speaking on the same matter, Military Spokesman Major General Roshan Seneviratne said that they were of the opinion that the Defence Headquarters would be relocated to Battaramulla by mid next year.

Farewell to smashed phone screen
Japanese researchers say they have developed a new type of glass that can heal itself from cracks and breaks.
Glass made from a low weight polymer called polyether-thioureas can heal breaks when pressed together by hand without the need for high heat to melt the material.
The research, published in Science, by researchers led by Professor Takuzo Aida from the University of Tokyo, promises healable glass that could potentially be used in phone screens and other fragile devices, which they say is an important challenge for sustainable societies.
While self-healing rubber and plastics have already been developed, the researchers said the new material was the first hard substance of its kind that can be healed at room temperature.
High mechanical robustness and healing ability tend to be mutually exclusive, wrote the researchers, saying while some hard but healable materials have been developed, in most cases, heating to high temperatures, on the order of 120C or more, to reorganise their cross-linked networks, is necessary for the fractured portions to repair.
The new polymer glass is highly robust mechanically yet can readily be repaired by compression at fractured surfaces.
The properties of the polyether-thioureas glass were discovered by accident by graduate school student Yu Yanagisawa, who was preparing the material as a glue. Yanagisawa found that when the surface of the polymer was cut the edges would adhere to each other, healing to form a strong sheet after being manually compressed for 30 seconds at 21C.
Further experimentation found that the healed material regained its original strength after a couple of hours.
Yanagisawa told NHK that he didnt believe the results at first and repeated his experiments multiple times to confirm the finding. He said: I hope the repairable glass becomes a new environment-friendly material that avoids the need to be thrown away if broken.
This is not the first time a polymer has been suggested as a healable screen for devices such as smartphones. Researchers at the University of California proposed the use of polymer that could stretch to 50 times its original size and heal breaks within 24 hours.
Smartphone manufacturers have already used self-healing materials in devices.
LGs G Flex 2 shipped in 2015 with a coating on its back that was capable of healing minor scratches over time, although failed to completely repair heavier damage.
According to research commissioned by repair firm iMend in 2015, over 21% of UK smartphone users were living with a broken screen, with smashed displays being one of the biggest issues alongside poor battery life.

First ship to Hambantota harbour since its handover
The first ship which laid anchor at the Hambantota Magampura International Port since it was handed over to the China Merchant Port Holdings Company under a 99 year lease agreement recently, was the Positivi Pioneer which arrived from Panama carrying a consignment of 400 vehicles.
The off loading operation of the consignment is handled by the Colombo Logistics Company. Since there were no workers to handle the port operations, a batch of new recruits who had been given a training were deployed for port operations since December 18.
Meanwhile, the Sathyagraha launched by parents of the former port employees demanding the re-deployment of their children, continued for the 28th day on December 18.
As the ship approached the Hambantota Port, the former workers joined their striking parents and conducted an invocation to the gods, smashing coconuts at the entrance gate praying for some sort of relief for the injustice caused to them.
President of the Magampura Port Workers Union I.K. Omez said their request to the SLPA was to recruit the 438 workers who lost their jobs to the Port Authority and re-deploy them for Hambantota Port operations. He said that in spite of representations made to the President regarding their issue, they had not received any redress to their problem so far.

A special team had been sent to investigate the incident.
Dr. Ginige pointed out that the samples of the patients have already brought to Colombo and have been tested negative for Influenza B.

How to simplify your digital life right now
In a studio apartment, with its tiny closets and even tinier kitchen cabinets, it's essential to be disciplined about clearing clutter. But online Where your Gmail inbox has seemingly endless storage space and you can hide your hoarding "in the cloud" It's easy to amass an insurmountable pile of digital junk.
Just like the-ahem... collectors on A&E's Hoarders, you'll need to start small if you want to tackle your mountain of digitial trappings.
Pare Down to 2 Email Accounts
One work and one home email address, that's all you need. If you're still hanging on to your university account or an inbox from an old job, take the steps now to get rid of them for good. Move over important contact information and forward any useful emails to your main address. When you're sure you've gotten all you need, close the accounts for good.
Uninstall Unused Software from your Computer
Don't need OpenOffice freeware now that you splurged on the Microsoft Suite Get rid of it. Make an uninstaller program the last software you use before trimming your software fat for good.
Purge your Mobile Device App Library
While you're cleaning out software from your laptop, make sure your mobile devices get the same love. Go through your smartphone or tablet to finally clear out those games, shortcuts and "productivity boosters" you never, ever use anymore.
Delete Old Documents.
Open up your computer's documents folder and sort everything by "date modified." If you haven't touched that spreadsheet in over a year, it's time to purge it from your machine. Save the stuff you think you might need onto an external hard drive designated for an unorganized "dump" (it's just an emergency backup, no need to get lost in a 3-day folder sorting spree), and permanently delete the rest.
Clear Your Computer Desktop
How many icons are on your desktop right now If you can't finish counting them on two hands, it's time to sift through 'em. Move often-used programs to your taskbar or dock, and sort all your documents within a single folder. Soon you'll find a clean desktop can be as calming as a clean kitchen.
Cancel Accounts onUnused Social Sites
You check Facebook every day, right But how often do you travel over to LinkedIn Keeping profiles open on social sites you never visit can be a security risk, not to mention a big waste of mental space. If it's the type of site where you need a password reminder each time you visit, do yourself a favor and click the "close account" button.
Change Your Notification Settings
Now that you're only subscribed to sites you visit often, you don't need notifications to alert you of a new photo tag or direct message. Change your alert settings to the bare minimum and you'll be clearing out your email or text message inbox at the same time. You might actually be more productive at work, too, without Facebook popping up on your phone's screen every two seconds.
Clean Up Your Browser
Browser plug-ins are the donut holes of the online world; they're easy and harmless to add on one-by-one, but before you know it, you've tacked on some serious weight to your toolbar. Clean up your web browser of choice by deleting all but the necessary plug-ins, toolbars and add-ons. Make your web experience as minimalist as possible.
Unsubscribe from Unneeded Email Lists
Subscribing to a store's email list for the free 20 percent off coupon you get for joining is smart shopping.
But staying subscribed to a list when you don't even open the emails before deleting them is stupid. Make this week your purge week and click "unsubscribe" at the bottom of each email as it comes in.
Clean Up Your Contacts
Using Siri on the iPhone 4S has brought to light a big problem: When we say "ring Sarah," Siri has to weed through about 12 people to figure out who we want to call. It's time we rid ourselves of unused contacts from old coworkers, long lost friends and ex-relationships-anyone you haven't spoken with in over a year is fair game.

The Minister said people of all walks of life were in this gathering and they were in various political parties. They all strengthens my political journey, he said. The Minster said he would launch a special programme for the Visira loan recipients and would set up a follow up programme to see whether those who received Visira loans have built houses. Minister Premadasa said 205,000 families were provided with housing loans to set up houses and 80,000 families in the Hambantota district have no proper dwellings. I want to provide houses for all of them under Semata Sevana Housing Programme, the Minister said. Minsters of the previous regime worked for the welfare of their family members and neglected the people who brought them into power.

Introducing Shakespeare to the local audience
The Shakespeare Centre Sri Lanka saw its inauguration on January 1, 1990 with the initiative of Obinmuni Gamini de Silva. The first discussion for this had been initiated with Sarath Dikkumbura, Ms Nayana Kumari, Sampath Arunasiri, Ashoka Muniwarage and Mahinda K. Premasiri seated as a special invitee.
Obinamuni Gamini de Silva took his oath as the President of the Shakespeare Centre Sri Lanka officially establishing it in the presence of the President J R Jayawardena on 16th January, 1990. This moment was witnessed by the Deputy British High Commissioner, E J Field Esq., The Deputy Director of the British Council, Colombo, Dr Marcus Milton, Prof. Tissa Kariyawasam, Prof. A J Gunawardena with Obinamuni Liswith de Silva. Obinamuni Gamini de Silva produced a report of objectives, projects, code of discipline and goals set for the period oif next 25 years.
 It was emphasized that we present our project against the bedrock of Royal Shakespeare Company GB, that we commit ourselves to its discipline and regulations and that we produce Shakespearean Literature of Theatre only with Shakespeare Centre Sri Lanka as the Centres main discipline. Dr. Marcus Milton asserted that it was the basic policy and discipline of the Royal Shakespeare Company, adding that Obinamuni Gamini de Silva must be sufficiently, aware of such specifications as a former student of the Company. The other guests did not forget to come up with their note of good visions.
President J R Jayawardena invoking this compliments expressed that drama and theatre, acting, cinema should be studied, that Shakespeare Centre Sri Lanka is a proper place for those who strive to learn theatre and that such an education can discipline and produce good actors for the country. This was accompanied by his emphasis that the Centre should not deflect from its focus on the set of principles in the face of any challenge. Because, in a country like Sri Lanka, the activation of the centre, can get openly restrained. Therefore, that the policy be reinforced.
The Presidents Private Secretary and the Director General of the J R Jayawardana Centre, Premathila,a Mapitigama took part in this event by way of organizing. Sarath dikkumbura, Nayana Kumari, Sampath Arunasiri, Asoka Muniwarage, Darmapala de Silva, Nimal Weerakkodi, Nayana Kumari, Sampath Arunasiri, Asoka Muniwarage, Darmapala de Silva, Nimal Weerakkodi, Deepani Silva, Piyal Chandana Perera, Anura Atigala, Wimal Dissanayaka, Ananda Senarath Yatagara, Laksiri Mendis, Samanthi Manage, Ajith Deshapriya, Ajantha Ranasinghe, Ajithy Jayasinghe, Sujeewa Shiromi, Kumudu Karunarathna, Upali Senarathna, Priyangani Dedigama, Susantha Pushpakumara, A M A Niyaz, Nirmala Perera, Sujeewa Herath, the members of the workshop on drama and theatre were the founding members of the Shakespeare Centre Sri Lanka. It is our duty to recall Saman Chandrarathna who organized the workshop.
Upali Senarath Premadasa, Kamal Deshapriya, R J Wijesooriya, Montague Sarathchandra, Padmasiri Kodikara, Ranjan Roderigo, Sanath Padmanatha, Walter Perera, Chandra Perera, Dr Rahul Perera, Visharad Saman Wickramarachchi, Nimal Karunarathna, Dr Ariyasena Handuwela, Lokubandara Alahakone, Visharad Austin Munasinghe, Col. Hemal Mendis, Sirinatha Wickramasinghe, Major T Nandasena, Waantha Delpachetra, Asoka Senarath Mudalige, K V D W Wijegunarathna, Jayantha Kumara Weragala joined in the very year. At the same time, our honourable advisers, President J R Jayawardena, Prof. Tissa Kariyawasam, Prof. A J Gunawardena, Prof. Carlo Fonseka, Prof. Nandadasa Kodagoda, General Cyril Ranathunga, Dr Karunasena Kodithuwakku, Dr Nelufer de Mel, Tissa Jayathilaka, Jayasumana Dissanayaka, Dharmasiri Gamage, Dr Tissa Abeysekara, Lakshman Jayakody, Dr Lakshmi de Silva, Dr Chanaka Amarathunga, Dr Sunil Wijesiriwardena, Dr Edwin Ariyadasa, Dr Gamini Hathhettuwegama, Visharad Lionel Ranwala, Commander Tissa Gunathilake, Rear Admiral Ananda Peiris, Rear Admiral Harsha Mayadunna, Rear Admiral Nihal Obeysinghe, Rear Admiral Wasantha Fernando, earnestly strengthened as with their valuable instructions to socialize the Shakespeare Centre within the Local perimeter.
Social activists such as Dr Paneeth Abeysundara, Prof. Mudiyanse Dissanayaka, Prof. Gamini Dela Bandara, Justice Pradeep Jayathilaka, President Counselor Wasantha Nawarathna Bandara, Dr Deshapriya S Wijethunga, Dr Damith de Silva, Dr Malitha Wijesundara, Saman Athaudahetti, Dr. Asangi Jayasinghe, Dr. Premadasa Sri Alawaththage, Dr Rajitha Senarathna, Senarath Kapukotuwa, Jeewan Kumaranathunga, Dr Leel Gunasekara, Prof. Chandrasiri Palliyaguru, Dr Mirando Obeysekara, Palitha Gamage stretch their hands of consistent support.
Similar to Obinamuni Gamini de Silvas efforts to incorporate the contribution of the above important personnel, the dedication by Sarath Dikkumbura, Nayana Kumari, Montague Sarathchandra, R G Wijesuriya, between 1990-1994 deserves the highest from of praise. The loss of 16 Sri 567 Toyota Corolla in 1993 as a result of the loan we had taken in 1992 to fund the Macbeth production makes a sorrowful gesture in our memory even today, because of its immaculate companionship.
Prof. Tissa Kariyawasam articulated once that Obinamuni Gamini de Silva dedicated his wealth and knowledge for the development of the centre by sacrificing his trade and business.
Othello emerging in 1990 was debatable representation of Shakespeares modern theatrical strategies of theatre, literature and theatre, thus making a leeway in the local arena. Othello was staged in 2001, 2011 and 2016 as new productions. Othello is all about a School of Acting. The measures are underway to take out Othello in Tamil.
The system of politics and discipline as enacted by the Shakespeare Centre Sri Lanka is quite sensitive. The remarkable nomination as Sri Lankas only voluntary institute of drama by the United Nations Volunteers, and the goodwill of the International Theatre Institute and Royal Shakespeare Company invest in us is their pride.

Its all systems go
Its election time once again, with Chairman of the Elections Commission Mahinda Deshapriya announcing that the Local Government Elections will be held on February 10, next year. The gazette setting out the date will be issued on December 26, he told a media briefing. A total of 15.7 million voters, in all the nine provinces, will go to the polls, on this day, to elect 8293 members for 23 Municipal Councils, 41 Urban Councils and 271 Pradeshiya Sabhas, in what is billed as the biggest election to be held in the country, so far. Deshapriya, also, as is his wont, has read the riot act warning elections law violators of tough and drastic action. There is little doubt that he would live up to his word, and, reputation, in this regard, if his actions at both, the presidential and general elections, is anything to go by.
There, of course, has been criticism on the long delay in holding the election. However it has to be accepted that there were genuine reasons for this, chief of which was the delimitation of electoral boundaries to favour one political party, that was carried out by the Rajapaksa regime, as was witnessed in the shift of a large chunk of territory from the Badulla District to Moneragala to buttress the regime's chances, at the last Uva Provincial Council election.
The Feb. 10 mini poll is to cost the taxpayer a massive Rs. 3000 million and it is hoped that this spending will be justified by the results shown on the ground. This is because Local Government bodies have so far only been a collective burden on the tax payer, and, which benefited only those elected, with voters getting a raw deal.
It is well and good that the LG elections are held even after an inordinate delay. Elections, after all, are the lifeblood of democracy and is also an ideal barometer not only to test the popularity of the rulers, but, also if the policies pursued by the government have succeeded or failed. However, it has also to be said that Local Government elections so far held in this country were always won by the party, or, alliance in power, indicating that larger national issues failed to have an impact, at these mini polls, with the voter. For one thing, the voters are aware who holds the purse strings, and, who is capable of ladling the gravy. Those in the position to shower largess always won. There is no indication that this poll is going to be any different.
True, living costs have soared and certain ruling party politicians have not exactly stood the test of public probity. There have also been failings in other areas such as the slow pace of development and the inability to implement election promises, such as roping in the swindlers and crooks of the former regime.
The positives, though, have far outweighed the negatives. The public today are free from fear and oppression. They have the freedom to criticize the government, as seen ad nauseam on television. The media is enjoying unbridled liberty, so much so some private TV channels are on a relentless mission to bring down the regime. No journalist is abducted, tortured or killed, after being white vanned'. Minority communities are not harassed or their businesses set on fire. The salaries of public servants have been raised by a whopping Rs. 10,000, the prices of essential drugs have been drastically slashed and meaningful steps have been taken by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to offer essential goods at reduced prices, to the public, with the cooperation of the private sector, including the Super Market chains.
What is more, activists of the Joint Opposition are pledging their loyalty to President Maithripala Sirisena in their droves, with two JO parliamentarians already in the government fold, indicating which way the wind is blowing. Panic buttons are being pressed, with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa urging voters to use the LG poll as a referendum to protest the government's move to bring in a new constitution, dispose of national assets, and, the witch-hunt carried out against the war heroes, failing to realize that the simple village folk are far removed from issues of constitution making, bond scams or macroeconomic strategies.
All they are interested in is the here and now- to repair their roads, culverts, bridges, ensure drinking water facilities and the proper disposal of the garbage and the resolution of other mundane problems. No larger stakes come into the equation at mini elections.
Besides, those contesting these elections will be grassroots leaders from the political parties, who are known, and, are, close to the locals, and, unscathed from any scandal that may have rubbed off on some of the top echelons in the Unity Government. Corruption allegations against the JRJ/Premadasa led UNP failed to sway the voters, nor did they against CBK, when their governments were in power, and all mini elections were won handsomely. There is no reason to doubt history repeating itself, this time around too.

JO MPs enraged with Rajapaksas - SB
Parliamentarians in the Joint Opposition are today enraged with Mahinda, Namal and Basil for thwarting President Maithripala Sirisenas efforts to unite the opposing SLFP factions, Social Empowerment Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
He said the President had an earnest wish to enable the SLFP to contest the forthcoming election as a strong united group by joining hands with the Joint Opposition members.
The Minister made this observation speaking to the media after handing over nominations for the Patha Hewaheta Pradeshiya Sabha election at the Kandy Elections office yesterday. He said the UPFA had no need to join hands with Wimal Weerawansa who is stuck neck deep in a pool of mud.
The SLFP will contest the election in coalition with all parties involved in the Podu Jana Eksath Peramuna government of 1994 including the Ceylon Workers Congress.

Join the UNP to develop rural areas - Mangala
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera called on all Sri Lankans to join with the United National Party (UNP) to strengthen the government to develop the nation.
At a time that the government has allocated more funds than that was ever allocated for the education and health sectors and Rs. 38 billion for the development of rural roads next year, we invite the constituents of Matara and all Sri Lankans to join the United National Party (UNP) to strengthen the government to develop our nation,he said. Samaraweera was addressing media personnel at the District Secretariat Matara last morning, after handing over the nomination lists for the Matara Municipal Council and the Matara Pradeshiya Sabha.
As much as we won over our nation, within the past three years our government has been able to win the goodwill of other nations in the world and look forward to win the support of the rural community as well. I call upon all members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party not to allow elements that made this country a center for commission agents and nurtured the white van culture to suppress the media to rise their heads again On being asked about the crisis faced by the tea industry the minister said that he had had discussions with the Russian Ambassador the previous day and was confident that the crisis will be resolved soon.

Joy of a toy
A wind spinner that splinters, a car with its metallic paint peeling, brightly-coloured plastic balls that go into the mouth and sometimes in the nose - toys are not the safest. Here are some tips that will help you choose the perfect playing thing for the child of your life.
Look at toys that grow with the child
This helps the child develop the ability to cherish the toy, rather than encouraging a use-and-throw culture. Children like to be challenged  a child may first just climb the ladder to a slide, and then sit at the top for a while, before gradually sliding down. As he gains confidence, he will climb the slide from the opposite end. Ask the toymaker how the toy will develop with the child.
Pick gender-neutral toys
Buy toys that dont have a gender at all, that focus on the character, so the child is free to imagine it in his or her own way.
Consider fooducation
The best way to get kids who fuss about food out of the habit, is to involve them in the cooking process. Encourage them to help out with prep, so theyre more likely to eat what theyve cooked, building their palate and developing a healthy relationship with food.
Get a toy with a positive message
Even as Barbie turns real with different body shapes, theres Nanea Mitchell, the newest doll from American Girl. A dark-skinned half-Hawaiian, shes from 1941 wartime America. Then theres Hearts for Hearts that has dolls from all over the world.
Read the toy label right Look for the company name
Not heard of them Check them out online. If theyre being imported, they pass our standards and are safe to use. If they are exporting to Europe, the US and Australia, theyll be safe as well.
Follow age grades
If a toy stipulates 3-6 months, it is only meant for that age group. There may also be a warning about small parts, so pay attention to that. www.thehindu.com

Kenya eyes Russia tea sales
Kenya wants to use the current tea trade spat, triggered by a single insect, between Russia and Sri-Lanka to boost its volumes to Moscow after years of low exports.
Wire agencies reported last week that Russia would place temporary restrictions on imports of tea and all other agricultural products from Sri Lanka from yesterday after a single beetle was found in a consignment.
The tea directorate says it sees the current impasse between the two countries as an opportunity for Kenya to boost sales.
We see this as an opportunity and a challenge at the same time. An opportunity in the sense that we should use this chance to grow our volumes to Russia and also learn from the misfortune that befell Sri-Lanka to improve our standards, said the directorate.
The country has over the last one year been working on a strategy to improve the volumes of tea bought by Russia and cut the dominance of Sri Lanka, which is the leading exporter to Moscow.
A Kenyan delegation led by Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture will be visiting Moscow in January for the launch of the strategy.
Kenya is third placed, both in terms of value and volume of tea exports to Russia.
Moscow imports about 13 per cent of the beverage from the Mombasa auction accounting for about 18 million kilos, but the volumes have been dropping in the last three years.
We are targeting to hit at least 44 million kilos of tea exported to Russia in the next three years, mainly looking at increasing quality black tea, said the directorate.
It has hired Russian consultants to provide intelligence on the profile of a Russian tea consumer and how best Kenya can reach its market. Kenya has identified and prioritised Russia because it is the leading importer of black tea while it is the leading exporter of the same.
It will be tough for Kenya to win over the Russian market because Sri Lanka, being the biggest exporter of tea to Russia, has put in massive resources in the last 20 years to cement its position.

Lanka, China commemorate 65th  Rubber-Rice Pact anniversary
(Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka and China on Monday exchanged plaques of friendship commemorating the 65th anniversary of the Rubber-Rice Pact agreement which was signed between the two countries in 1952.
The celebratory event was held in capital Colombo and attended by Sri Lankas Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya, Charge dAffaires of the Chinese embassy in Sri Lanka Pang Chunxue and relatives of both Sri Lankan and Chinese ministers who signed the pact 65 years ago.Jayasuriya said at the event that the friendship between China and Sri Lanka had strengthened since the signing of the agreement, and he thanked China for always supporting the island country.
I would not really call the Pact a trade agreement but I would call this an agreement of friendship.
At that time, in 1952, rice had become a very politically sensitive commodity in Sri Lanka and we were facing a severe shortage, Jayasuriya said. The friendship between China and Sri Lanka dates back to a long time ago and is stepping into a new phase under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, said Pang.

Lankan Ambassador discusses tourism,  commercial activity with new CEO of Gulf Air
The Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the Kingdom of Bahrain, Dr A. Saj U. Mendis, had a meeting with the newly appointed Chief Executive Officer of Gulf Air, Kresimir Kucko, last week, to discuss the most efficacious courses of action as well as strategies to enhance and to boost tourism in particular and other commercial, economic, investment and trade activities between the two countries.
The Gulf Air, the flagship carrier of the Kingdom of Bahrain, operates five direct flights between Colombo and the Kingdom of Bahrain, thus complementing the flights of Sri Lankan Airlines as well.
Kresimir Kucko was the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Croatia Airlines since 2012 until was appointed as the CEO of Gulf Air, last month. The Chief Executive Officer, Kresimir Kucko, and Ambassador Dr. Mendis, during the meeting, broached and underscored a myriad of issues ranging from tourism, economic activity including trade and investments, connectivity between and among nations, geo-political and geo-economic dynamics and developments in the region and in the world and people to people contact, among others.
It is of firm conviction of both the CEO and the Ambassador that the operation of Gulf Air to Sri Lanka would markedly enhance not only tourism from the Kingdom of Bahrain to Sri Lanka, but also other concomitant economic, commercial and investment activity, thus benefiting both the countries. The Gulf Air has placed firm orders for state of the art aircraft, such as Boeing-787, and it currently operates 30 aircraft serving over 40 destinations around the world.
In year 2016, the tourism from the Kingdom of Bahrain to Sri Lanka was merely 3,000 and last year, the tourism from Bahrain to Sri Lanka has risen to approximately close to 10,000. It is strongly expected that this year the tourism to Sri Lanka from the Kingdom of Bahrain would reach nearly 14,000 to 15,000, particularly given the fact that Sri Lankan Airlines has daily direct flights as well as the direct flights of Gulf Air.
The Chief Executive Officer, Kresimir Kucko stated to Ambassador Dr Mendis that a large number of travel agents and tour operators as well as potential vacationers in Bahrain are keen to travel to Sri Lanka since it offers almost all touristic attractions of any given country.
In addition, given the current political milieu and environment in the world, Sri Lanka is very stable and very safe for any foreigner or tourist to travel to almost any location in Sri Lanka. Ambassador Dr Mendis punctuated and accentuated the fact that a number of reputed international journals and magazines such as National Geographic and Lonely Planet have listed Sri Lanka as one of the most favored and sought after touristic destinations in the world.
Ambassador Dr Mendis also stated to the CEO Kresimir Kucko that Sri Lanka Tourism (SLT) conducted a mega Road Show to promote tourism from the Kingdom of Bahrain to Sri Lanka a couple of months ago. Ambassador Dr. Mendis also stated that the reception of tour operators and travel agents in Bahrain were most impressive and overwhelming. Most of the travelers from Bahrain are frequent and repeat travelers and they discuss about the diverse touristic attractions of Sri Lanka with delight and pleasure.
He also added that Sri Lanka received well over two million tourists last year and it is the third largest foreign exchange earner of the country behind the remittances of migrant workers and garment sector.
Both the CEO and Ambassador agreed that strategic augmentation and aggressive promotion of tourism in Sri Lanka would lead to economic and commercial advancement of the country more rapidly than any other sector, particularly, given the overall potential of the country.

## Title: Lankan batting slump continues unabated

SL-India ODI series reviewWith or without Kohli the result is still a loss
Lankan batting slump continues unabated
The consistent slumps suffered by the Sri Lankan middle order batting continued unabated as it contributed to their fourth consecutive ODI series defeat for the year when India won the three-match series 2-1. A stunning win in the first ODI at Dharamsala proved only to be a flash in the pan as Sri Lanka were outplayed in the next two matches at Mohali and Visakhapatnam to lose the series rather comprehensively without putting up much of a fight.
This type of tame surrender of the series without resistance is not akin to the Sri Lankan sides of the recent past especially after 1995 till the last World Cup in 2015 when Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara made their last ODI appearances against South Africa at Sydney. It was from here that the gradual decline of Sri Lankas middle order began and started to disintegrate and reach the stage to what it is today.
Since the 2015 World Cup, Sri Lanka has played in 12 bilateral ODI series and won only two of them against West Indies and Ireland  two teams hardly worth talking about. It is to such low depths has the once proud Lankan batting line-up and performances slumped.
To be fair by the bowlers the batsmen have been guilty of not putting up enough runs on the board for them to defend.
Why Sri Lanka finds themselves unable to produce batsmen of quality as in the past is a mystery. We boast of one of the best nurseries in school cricket but yet at international level there seems to be a wide gap between us and other top cricketing nations.
Take the case of the third and final ODI at Visakhapatnam where Sri Lanka inserted first by India were in a very good position to post a total beyond 300 plus and put themselves in line for an elusive maiden ODI series win over the hosts. But from a position of strength at 160-2 at the start of the 27th over the Lankan batting simply crumbled without a fight to be dismissed for 215 in 45 overs  losing their last eight wickets for a mere 55 runs in 18 overs. It was not that the pitch suddenly started to play tricks on the batsmen nor was the Indian spinners unexpectedly become unplayable, but it was poor shot selection that led to this crazy rout. This has now become a common pattern in the Lankan batting and unless a solution is sought to stop this type of hara-kiri batting the ODI side is certainly heading for disaster.
There is so much talk of the work ethics put in by the players and the support staff in preparation for the matches, but if all that hard work cannot be produced in the middle it is of no avail. What ails the batsmen from reciprocating what they do at practice in the middle is what needs to be addressed and addressed very quickly. This carnival has been going on for too long and the buck must stop at some point if not we will find ourselves falling deep into a mire from which we will find it extremely difficult to dig ourselves out.
The fact that India were able to beat Sri Lanka so easily even without their run-scoring captain Virat Kohli who was given a rest from international cricket speaks highly of the bench strength the hosts have. It is something that we Sri Lankans must also try to emulate. India of course has been successful because of the IPL which has enabled them to unearth unhidden talent and because of the vast resources available to them considering the size of the country (50 times bigger) and the population of the country (one billion people more) than Sri Lanka.
As in the first match of the Test series (Kolkata), Sri Lanka found a track that suited their fast-medium bowlers in the first ODI played in the hilly mountains of Dharamsala and they managed to bundle out the hosts for a mere 112 runs and coast home by seven wickets. But at Mohali and Visakhapatnam on flat pitches the bowlers were found wanting  lacking in pace and the absence of any movement made easy pickings for the Indian batsmen.
Rohit Sharma in his first stint as captain of India led the recovery for his team with a stunning double century that was followed by another masterful batting display by his opening partner Shikhar Dhawan in the third ODI that saw them seal the series quite easily.
The only positive note from Sri Lankas view point was the form of former captain Upul Tharanga who completed 1000 ODI runs in the calendar year during his innings of 95 to join Kohli and Sharma as the only batsmen to do so for 2017. Despite the ups and downs of his captaincy Tharanga managed to maintain consistent form throughout the year which none of his team mates could replicate.
Sri Lanka thus finish their ODI run for 2017 on a rather solemn note - 5 wins from 29 matches with 23 defeats and one no-result with a success rate of just 17.85 which is the lowest achieved by any ODI playing nation for the year that includes countries like Afghanistan, Hong Kong, Ireland, Papua New Guinea, Scotland and UAE. India on the other hand finished with 21 wins (the highest for the year) from the same number of matches with 7 losses (1 no-result).

Sansara gaman maga senahasa soya dineka

Oba mavetha thilina kala obe betibara suvanda

Mage malagamadaata evith yannata enna
Voice: Sunil Edirisinghe
Lyrics: Dishan Nanayakkara
Music: Karunaratne Wijewardena
What could be your honest feeling if you have ever lost in love What could be the thought-stream of someone who has lost in love like For most people, a loss in love is end of one whole lifetime. The protagonist of this song hates that painful feeling. He looks forward to no more such painful feelings in times to come. Although his world is gloomy without the presence of even sun and moon, he would not wish the same for his love. He wants all her aspirations to come true. He is quite familiar with her fragrance, but wants her to take that away too.
Recorded in 2006, this song was later included in the CD titled as Mata Mavak Lesin. The CD contains songs by the veteran vocalists such as Victor Ratnayake, Karunaratne Divulgane, Deepika Priyadarshani, Bandara Athavuda, Nirmala Ranatunga, Samantha Perera and Somasiri Medagedara. At first, this song was broadcast on the national radio service. That drew quite a large response to this song. Then it drew even a larger response with the awakening of the social media in 2007. And today, the song has entered the hearts of millions of fans.
The popularity of the song could be accredited to Sunil Edirisinghes soft yet deep and resonant voice. And Karunaratne Wijewardanas melodious music has also been instrumental in making the song popular.
Sunil Edirisinghe needs no particular introduction among the Sinhala listener base. He has earned a covetous benchmark for his careful selection of songs. That very same reason has led to certain monotony among his music. But he scores in lyrics as well as his voice. He has been fortunate enough to muster the support of classical lyricists such as Karunaratne Saputanthri, Bandara Eheliyagoda and Kularatne Ariyawansa. If someone tends to think that classical generation is fading away, let them cross that thought out for we have Dishan Nanayakkara who is brilliant in metaphor and poetry in the serious business of lyric writing.
Out of lyrics, voice and music, the most difficult part should be the lyrics part. But then the lyricist has to be satisfied with the role of an unsung hero.
Most songwriters will tell you that chorus lyrics often happen rather easily, but its the cursed verse lyrics that take forever. And for some, even after spending days, weeks or even months on the verse, it can still sound like a mess. Theres a simple reason for that, and it has to do with the differing nature of verse and chorus lyrics. While the chorus simply needs to express emotions, the verse needs to describe a somewhat coherent story or set of circumstances that all lead to an emotional response.
And getting that story right is the main challenge. For multi-verse songs (which is most songs), its often the second verse that presents even bigger problems than verse. How do you split a story up between the first verse and the second verse
The fact is that even though we often describe lyrics as telling a story, in fact its really describing a situation more so than telling a story. And in fact, if the song lyrics are telling a story, the job of writing the lyric may not be so hard. Its pretty clear in those kinds of songs the order of events.
But a large number of songs use the verse to describe a circumstance, so that the verse is saying, Heres what I am going through right now. The chorus that follows that will usually put an emotional response to that front and centre.

Makeup brand that caters to transgenders
Unisex fashion has never been hotter, and the beauty world is taking note. So much so that there is a new unisex beauty brand on the horizon, designed with transgender women in mind. Dubbed Jecca, the brand is the brainchild of makeup artist Jessica Blackler, whose diverse client list led her to address the gaps in the current beauty market with her own cruelty-free, vegan, inclusive cosmetics brand.
Its first product, which can be pre-ordered online at jecca-makeup.com and will begin shipping later this month, is called Correct & Conceal, and promises to cover beard shadow, birthmarks, and acne, as well as undereye circles and blemishes.
According to the brands website, the concealer, which currently runs in two shades, offers a taste of many more thoughtfully created products to follow.
Jecca overlooks gender and celebrates individuality, Blackler told The Cut of the project. Were not a brand that concentrates on just women.
Jeccas inclusive ethos will undoubtedly be a welcome addition to the beauty industry, despite a slow, ongoing shift in traditional attitudes regarding makeup and gender.
Several big name brands have teamed up with male influencers on makeup campaigns or collaborations throughout 2017, with highlights including a collection from Mac and the beauty vlogger Patrick Starrr, and a collaboration between BH Cosmetics and German YouTuber Marvyn Macnificent.
Meanwhile, transgender actress and LGBT activist Laverne Cox launched her own nail polish collection with Orly Nails back in September, and Hari Nef, also a transgender activist and actress, landed a starring role in the LOral Paris True Match campaign Your Skin, Your Story, which debuted in January.

Migrants heading elsewhere from ASEAN region up five-fold since 1990
The number of migrants headed to other countries in the ASEAN region has increased more than five-fold since 1990, reaching nearly 6.9 million a recent UN report states. Millions more are employed without legal status and are not captured in official data. Despite rapid growth in the numbers of women and men migrating in South-East Asia, the outcomes for migrant workers are not well understood, says Ben Harkins, ILO Technical Officer and lead author of the report. The study also identifies the need to increase access to skills development opportunities for migrant workers. Migrants who increased the skill level of their employment from before migration to after had much better long-term outcomes. Skills development and validation in partnership with employers can help migrant workers move into jobs with better wages and working conditions, bolstering their economic contribution, says Anna Platonova, IOM Thailand Senior Programme Manager.
Through improved livelihoods, labour migration can have a lasting impact on poverty reduction within ASEAN. We found that the number of migrants living below the poverty line was reduced by 11% after return, Platonova said. That suggests that migration can be effective in decreasing
poverty within the region.
The study-report was developed a Migration Outcomes Index (MOI) to measure changes in the lives of migrant workers from before to after their migration According to Harkins, The MOI represents a break not only from the narrow focus on counting remittances but also from the human trafficking paradigm that is very dominant in South-East Asia. It offers a more nuanced assessment of migration experiences than just trafficked or not trafficked.
There is a lot of emphasis placed on changing the behavior of migrants to prevent exploitation and abuse, particularly encouraging them to migrate through regular channels, observes Harkins. The thinking is that migrants are making risky decisions and that is putting them in harms way.
But the data shows otherwise, Our findings suggest that the problem is not that migrant workers are making the wrong choices but that they are very vulnerable to abuse regardless of their decisions. They are a group of workers to which a largely different set of rules apply. The risks are even greater for women migrants because their work is often undervalued and affords fewer labour protections.
What is most important for improving outcomes is ensuring that all migrants benefit from fundamental labour rights such as the minimum wage, including women and men employed in the informal economy.That requires changes to policy and practice by governments, employers, and recruitment agencies rather than to the behavior of migrant workers, explains Harkins.

Mirror of gesture
The Mirror of Gesture is an English translation of Abinaya Darphana of Nandikeshwarar which was originally in Sanskrit. The Abinaya Darphana was originally translated into Telugu by Nidamangalam Madabhushi Tiruvenkatachari in 1874. Nandikeshwarar is believed to be a legendary figure of the art.
This great gift is an abridgement to the Indian dance world. Actually Indian culture is totally based on the art of gesticulation. Even the Indian singers sing, add the essence of emotional involvement with their singing and incorporate with action to bring out the full meaning.
Similarly, the Indian dances are mainly based on the interpretation of the meaning of the adopted songs that convey the meaning of the act through facial expression in the form of Bhava, Rasa and Abhinaya.
Indian iconography
Expressing the meaning of the song through Abhinaya means directly interpreting the verses through Bhava and hand gestures. Hand gestures are known as mudras in Tamil, and in Sanskrit they are called hastas. Hand gestures are an important mode of language in Indian dances, paintings, sculptures and Indian iconography.
The Indian philosophical study occupies a significant place in international sphere. To understand this great philosophy one must go deep into the subject. Simply this gesture language study is seems to have been adopted in the Indian art field.
The original version of the Abinaya Darphana of Nandikeshwarar is a complete and complicated work. It is not an easy task to understand the Abinaya Darphana. Dr Ananda K Coomaraswamy introduced this concept as the form of Mirror of Gesture. Even the English title reflects the in-depth meaning of the book.
The Sri Lankan born world renowned artist, philosopher, scholar, researcher and cultural ambassador Dr Ananda K. Coomaraswamy made an exceptional contribution to the oriental art world by translating this great treasure into English.
Treasure trove
It is not a mere translation. Dr Ananda K. Coomaraswamy studied and understood the subject matter thoroughly before translating this great treasure trove Abinaya Darphana. By translating this great work into English Dr Coomarswamy appraised the western world of the Indian culture. He spent most of his life in the West.
He wanted to make the western world aware of the Indian based gesticulation language. He also wanted to show the value of the Asian culture and civilization to the western world. The hand gesticulation language influences and interprets the Indian philosophical epics, dance, drama, paintings and sculptures. The great work Abhinaya Darphana deals with numerous factors.
The introductory chapter deals with the invocation. It reveals the typical Indian style of methodology. The second chapter provides a special place for the dramatic dialogue between Lord Indira and Nandikeshwarar. Through the dialogue the reader gets an impression on the outlook of the subject matter of the divine Abinaya Darphana.
Different positions
Then it continues with the elaborate matters dealing with the division of dance, type of audience, nature of the danseuses, category of different head positions and movements, category of different eye glances, movements of eye brows, illustration of 28 - 30 single hand gestures and 23 double hand gestures. It also denotes hand gestures for numerous social relationships for instance the specific hand gestures for mother, father and uncle are elaborately explained. Different well - defined hand gestures are adopted for different Devas, different hands for the Navagrahas, and for different deities. Mirror of Gesture even suggests different hand gestures for different emperors, trees, animals, water creatures and flying creatures. The special hand illustrations are also given to the seven oceans.
Hence the aim of Mirror of Gesture is to provide a wealth of information to the artistes about the meaning of the song through the use of hand gestures, body movements, head positions, eye movements and eye brow movements.

The most luxurious public transport ever
Bleary-eyed Brits could soon be ferried home at the end of a long day on this ultra-luxurious bus - fitted with beds.
Passengers on the vehicle, which designers hope will eventually operate on eight routes across four UK cities in Autumn 2018, will be able to sleep off their excesses in 14 discreet futuristic pods.
And they wont have to worry about missing their stop because stewards will be on hand to wake them up before they reach their destination. The bus has been in development for four months, with Surrey-based Andersson-Wood architects working on its design.
James Cox, CEO of high-tech sleep brand, Simba ( www.simbasleep.com ), who are behind the idea, said: New research shows we doze off on public transport 27 times a year and are at our most sleep deprived in December.
Shift working and nights out are real sleep thieves that can rack up a serious slumber-debt over time. For workers and party-goers alike  the prospect of walking straight into your bed as soon as youve finished is the dream, but for many it can involve a lengthy commute home when youre shattered or a bit worse for wear. Were always looking at how we can use our technology to redefine an existing experience. The Snoozeliner service is all about helping people top up some valuable lost sleep time in a design thats every bit as comfortable as their bed at home.
Simba plan to fit USB chargers and WiFi to every bus, as well as a storage system for valuables.
Revolutionary software will enable passengers to tap in their stop when they board so stewards know when to wake them up.
Early images reveal a striking vertical forest integrating air purifying and calming plants.
The cutting-edge sleep pods will also have sound isolating treatments, acoustic black-out blinds and a recessed amber light-therapy system as orange wavelengths are the most conducive to sleep.
Each booth will offer a choice of soothing scent infusions, recognized by aromatherapists for their sleep-inducing or hangover -busting properties, as well as individual recessed sanitised shoe drawers and coat storage.
Simba is also in talks with a food delivery service to provide an advanced on-board system that will cleverly track your route, so you and your takeaway arrive home at the same time.
Unlimited free mineral water, with coffee and specially-selected smoothies will also be available, with individual revitalizer kits containing Vitamin C and liver-cleansing Milk Thistle.
The buses will be fitted throughout with the brands pioneering pillow, duvet and mattress technology, which features a unique fusion of 2,500 patented conical springs and responsive memory foam layers that each provide comfort, support and heat regulation.Simba, which has fans such as elite footballer Gareth Bale, Made In Chelsea star and Instagram fitness inspiration fan Louise Thompson, comedian Russell Kane and X Factor online presenter Becca Dudley, hopes to launch the service in Autumn 2018 with prices starting from 8.50.
The sleep firm came up with the idea after they carried out a study which uncovered a nation of sleepy commuters catching some extra shut-eye on their commute.

PAFFREL calls for curtailing of election expenditure of candidates
Peoples Action for Free and Fair Election (PAFFREL) Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said that PAFFREL seeks the approval of the Legislature to a draft prepared by them (PAFFERL) to curtail the election expenditure of candidates.
He said that with the draft, PAFFREL hopes to create an advanced election culture specially to curtail election expenditures with a view to conducting a free and fair election.
Hettiarachchi was addressing an awareness programme for media personnel on the draft in Colombo yesterday.
He said the Local Government election will be held under Ward System and therefore the total number of members will be doubled. Unlike the previous occasion, there is a probability that the candidate of a Ward can spend lavishly on the election as the Ward is much smaller than an electorate.
Therefore, at the initial stage, PAFFREL drew attention on curtailing election expenditures of candidates contesting under the Ward System.Later, it was considered to implement the proposed guidelines to the Provincial Council and Parliamentary Elections, Hettiarachchi said.
PAFFREL believes that there should be a limitation of candidates expenditures with the introduction of the new electoral system, he said.
Hettiarachchi said that politics is a more lucrative business than social service now. Therefore, some sort of a mitigation monitoring system is needed for conducting a healthy and fair election.
This prevailing election culture should be changed. We are engaging in strengthening the legal framework by introducing these proposals, he said.
He said people should elect the best person for their Ward at the forthcoming Local Government election without considering the political party that the candidate that person belongs to. Corrupt candidates or candidates who spend large amounts of money on elections should not be elected as they tend to use their political clout to make illegal money once elected.

He started using coloured ball point pens as his medium and gradually used those pens to do bigger paintings which enabled me to have my third Solo art Exhibition in the year 1994 at the National Museum in Fort Galle.
For the past few years, altogether he has had 24 Solo Art Exhibitions at the Lionel Wendt, Laksala, Public Library and other places. His paintings that were displayed were of various mediums such as acrylic, oil, water colours and the main were the paintings done using coloured ballpoint pens. Many popular Artists and commentators of the Art World had mentioned that they have never come across in the past of such paintings done using coloured ballpoint pens. Even though now this medium is commonly used all over the world.

Prey
Penetrating eyes focus on me with greed
I saw the perpetrator watch my step,
I shall not fall prey to an evil mind
Running fast as I could with my lantern in hand
I felt his shadow stealthily trail behind,
It leapt on me, but I clutched fast to my light.
Shoving the burning lantern on him with all my might
That blinded the criminal,
I saw it retreat with deep pain and fright,
A miracle saved me in the nick of time.

Christmas  The Holiness
Today, in the beginning of time
Christmas continues unabated
It was that first Christmas
The sky glittering with stars
Spread sporadic a splatter of light
That day dedicated to god
As Christ was born in Bethlehem
That news made rejoice
Story spread far and wide
A touch of birth religiosity
Then the purpose of prophesy
Holiness abound continues
Through times speeding wings
Endowed with the morally good
The spiritual and the supernatural
Holiness Thrives every Christmas
Dedicated to a god incarnate
Today still time continues
As Christmas greet all Holiness
Miran Perera,

Remember When
Remember when we first did meet,
our hearts rejoiced and skipped a beat.
Remember our first kiss goodnight,
the hug we shared that summers night.
Remember when we walked the beach
and all our dreams within our reach.
Remember how we used to be
when I had you and you had me.
Remember when we used to talk,
when we held hands and took long walks.
Remember how we spent our days
in warm sunshine and in the rain.
Remember when our one desire
was take a chance and ignite the fire.
Remember the times that made our hearts melt
and all of the passion and desire that we felt.
Remember when you looked at me
and saw the one you love and need.
Remember when you reached for me
and knew that we were meant to be.
Remember when our love was new.
Remember the day we both said, I do.
Remember the journey we started together.
Remember our love was always forever.
Remember the promise we made together,
to love and to cherish and to care for each other.
Remember the promise in good times and in bad
and to make each one happy rather than sad.
Remember when you held our child
and rocked the baby when I grew tired.
Remember the treasured times
like these when love grew into family.
Remember when the world was bright,
when we would laugh and hold on tight.
Remember when our hearts were broken,
when times were tough and words unspoken.
Remember when we grieved our loss
with parents gone and feeling lost.
Remember when our love endured
the pains and heartaches of the world.
What happened to the life we shared
What happened to a love so rare
What happed to the kiss goodnight,
the warm embrace, the love at night
Did it all just happen How do we right the wrong
I know that in my heart your arms I do belong.
Can we live our lives together just like it all began,
and can we hold and cherish each other and remember our love again
Marcia A. Newton
TIMES
Twenty years growth
Twenty years to abound
Twenty years to be steady
Twenty years slack off
We come to know
A companion when
We face hardness
A warriorin war fields
An honest person
When given a loan
Returns approximately
Spouse, when wealth disappear
Forty years youth old age
Fifty, old ages young age
Life consists of two portions
Past was a dream
Future desiring
A Seconds error
Causes lifetime sorrow
A seconds patience
Wins years of wholesome
Better not start  than
Leaving half
Minds dont grow old
A loving mind ever young
Youth is a Roses garland
Youth live convincingly
Olds live with golden memories
Todays merits brings in
Tomorrows sweet and joy
A misers account book
And a donors same
At the end of the year
The same
Misers living  wouldnt
Last long
No one knows what will happen
Tomorrow, at dawn
Accept weather as it is
Seasons are divinity
Fahim Latiff
A majestic apology!
The blind jumbo, the twisted tusker
The Galgamuwe king of the jungle
I most solemnly kneel at your feet, at your graveyard
On behalf of all Sri Lankans
And beg forgiveness from you
As I too happened to be one of the species
Of that callous breed, mankind.
In the prime years of your dignified life
A gang of bloody barbarians
For the sake of easy money
In greed of your precious ivory
Put an end to your noble life
And your unsuspicious gigantic body
Was an easy target for the heartless poachers.
This heinous crime upon a blind noble creature
Is a disgrace to all mankind, an unpardonable shame
And the pain you had undergone
Is unimaginable tot he animal lovers
To the sensitive mind.
Yet we can imagine your tragic fall
The fall of a majestic mighty king
We can imagine how silently you bone the agony
With your big heart.
A decade ago
The wicked poachers
Had deprived you of your invaluable sight
And since then you wandered like a helpless pauper
What a pathetic plight for a noble creature like you!
Though you are no more
We who have boundless love for fauna and flora
Share your untold pains, sorrow and tears
We apologize to you
The tortured pride of Sri Lanka
Not once, but a thousand times
We pray
May you never face mans mean acts
Mans inhuman, shamelful, wicked deeds!
D. H. Shanthiratne
Torn between
How did I get to this point in my life
Love really does cut like a knife,
Torn between two lovers; both dear to my heart.
Now I must choose, one gets my heart and other departs.
Why is this so hard to do
How do choose, between the two
Do I give a chance to my new love
Do I give another chance to my first love
My first love theres, security and familiarity,
My new love is a good woman, devoted, fun and exciting.
My first love,
Our love was strong and true,
There was nothing we wouldnt do,
As time passed, resentment grew between us,
Putting fault, blame and mistrust between us.
You left me because you needed the space
And time to think, to decide if this is just a waste.
You gave me no choice, I wanted to try,
I still wanted to keep you and our love alive.
You said, I just need time to think and get away,
If you want a chance to get me back some way;
Then you have to relax and give up the chase,
Just leave me alone and let me have a little space.
So, I gave you, your wish, I left you alone,
Every now and then I tried to phone,
But always the same, Just leave me alone
My new love,
You stayed by my side through all of my pain,
You said, Its alright youll love again.
I tried not to hurt but you wanted the truth,
So, I told you I still love her, and that our love was true.
You said, Its okay, lets just enjoy it while we can.
Right now, Im with you and I dont want any other man.
I couldnt believe that you still wanted me,
I told myself you cant do this to her, make her leave.
But the truth was I needed you there with me,
And as time went on I started to see,
Just how dear youd become to me.
I told you I loved you quite by mistake,
But I knew I fell for you and it was too late,
I couldnt deny what I felt inside.
Until one day she finally called, she said, I want to give us one more try.
My heart was confused and I felt so overwhelmed, I wanted to cry.
Why is this so hard, now I dont know what to do
How do choose, between the two
Myleena Love

Polythene ban in full force from January 1
The law banning the use and production of polythene less than 20 microns will be strictly implemented from January 1, 2018.
Central Environment Authority Chairman Prof. Lal Mervin Dharmasiri said offenders will be subject to a fine of not more than Rs 10,000 and or a jail sentence of not more than two years.
Addressing the media at the Central Environment Authority (CEA) yesterday, the Chairman said that the ban on polythene was officially announced on September 1.
But considering the repeated requests made by the Polythene Manufacturers Association, the time period was extended upto January 1, 2018.
The association had requested a grace period claiming that the time frame which had been provided to them to adapt to the new law is insufficient to replace their existing products and to clear the stock of banned products already manufactured by them.
Prof. Dharmasiri said the CEA has already taken action to inspect polythene manufacturing companies with the assistance of the Police, Sri Lanka Standards Institution and the Consumer Affairs Authority. The CEA has already conducted raids to apprehend those who engage in illegal polythene manufacturing.
Raids to nab wholesale shop owners still using polythene bags and other banned products will be conducted from January 1 and retail shops will also be monitored later, he added.
The CEA has also taken measures to implement a ban on the import of recycled plastic raw materials from July 31, to encourage local plastic recyclers.
The President has also instructed the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) to ban the use of polythene during the upcoming election campaign and strictly enforce the law against people who violate the polythene ban.
Gazette Notification No 2034/37, has prohibited the use of all forms of polyethylene, polypropylene and polyethylene products or polypropylene products as decorations in political, social religious, national, cultural or any other event or occasion.

Asian International School
On a razors edge
When your leadership is balanced on a knife edge, it takes a strong leader to rise to the occasion. It is this quality that Head Girl of Asian International School Nishita Wijeratne possesses. Perfect Prefect features Nishita Wijeratne, a combination of humility and self- assurance.
I work well under pressure. When we need to lead people, it is usually at a swimming meet or such an event. So there is a lot of people who need you to do a lot of different things. There is a lot of pressure, so you need to be able to bear that pressure. So you need to have a clear mindset and for that you need to be able to delegate duties and know what you are doing as well. So I think I work really well under pressure. The fact that I can bear pressure well, allows me to continue to lead and I dont crack under pressure, said Wijeratne
Great strength
Wijeratne does not function alone. Her fellow Head Prefect is her ally along with their efficient Prefect Guild. The power of two is indeed a great strength to her.
Before implementing a decision I always discuss it with my fellow Head Boy as well as the student counsellor and Prefects. So there are many people putting in their opinions as well. I respect the opinion of my fellow Head Boy, and he respects my opinion and we actually work really well together, stated Wijeratne.
Though a competent leader she recognizes that we are all human and that we all make mistakes. However this does not stop her from executing a plan of action to perfection.
When facing a particularly difficult situation or problem what I do is break off from it. You are not going to get a problem without a solution. You wont get a locked door without a key. Sometimes you need to take a break and step away from it and look at it with a fresh mindset. The minute you do that you might see things you did not notice before. It is not like it is the end of the world. You need to know that and you need to take a step back and realize that everyone is human. Everyone makes mistakes and you need to go about fixing it. It is not going to be perfect but sometimes it just needs to be done, explained Wijeratne.
Asian International School was where she was nurtured and brought up. AIS was where she learnt her lessons in life. It is where her character was molded.
Smallest things
One thing at AIS is, yes we are taught academically and our teachers speak to us about life lessons. When I joined AIS, I was new to school and was pretty much an outsider but everyone came together for me and were supportive. Everyone supports you no matter what happens, and I came from Australia and I was not familiar with the set up here. Because the setup there was quite different.
But when I came here everyone made me feel so welcome. When I joined school I was really afraid of the smallest things but I remember this child gave me a book, and she told me study it. She gave me her book and then she failed the test. That kind of support is always going to be here at AIS. That is one thing I learnt. So everyone will back you up, you just got to be there to back them up as well. And that kind of support gets you a long way. That is one thing AIS has taught me. I know if ever I have an issue I am not alone because I have my Prefects guild. I have my Head boy to back me up. Coming from Australia the kids never alienated me. So that was a plus point, elucidated Wijeratne.
Asian International School is a tight knit community where there have been no serious issues of indiscipline. The school is known for its unity and the students have impeccable character. The school is an example of brotherhood and sisterhood. Wijeratne answered a hypothetical question  what would she do if she came across a case of bullying.
We have a club called TASLAH (Take A Stand Lend A Hand), so when we come across cases of bullying, I believe the best thing to do is to talk to a teacher. If the bullying is really intense then you need to talk about it. Sometimes you need to bring it up with an adult. You need to take it up with an adult, if it is going on for a long time. You need to talk to the kid and see if they are ok and ask them how they feel.
Maybe just lend a hand. You need to be a friend to the smaller ones. After a while they look up to you, so you need to make yourself approachable. Make them know there is someone they can talk to. Sometimes you may need to talk to the bully and see if you can get through to them since they themselves may be dealing with difficult issues in life. You may need to talk to both parties separately. But as a prefect the first thing you do is stop it. So the first thing you need to do is make yourself approachable and get through to the two parties. Try and get them to open up to you by asking very basic questions. Sometimes when you talk about something you feel better about it. Then you can give the victim a piece of advice with small words of encouragement and about standing up, pointed out Wijeratne.
No doubt Wijeratnes interpersonal skills have enabled her to be of assistance to a friend who was in need.
I was in TASLAH and I had a buddy who was getting bullied for creating havoc in class! He was a bit of a naughty child. And his grades werent too good. All I did was I talked to him and helped him out with his math. And the situation improved. I might talk to the bully and say it is not nice to bully. The level of harshness and the tone I would use would of course depend on the age. A 17 year old bullying a 12 year old is of a serious nature, which would require a harsh reprimand. But I am proud to say that we have not had such incidents in school at all, added Wijeratne.
An ardent admirer of the Russian President Putin, she admires Putin for his patriotism.
I admire Russian President Vladimir Putin. One thing I admire is, he would do a lot for his country. The way he does it is very efficient. He is of course very intimidating but he is very rational as well. I think he is a good leader. He is not perfect but nobody is. I like the way he leads and possesses great leadership, said Wijeratne.
Global warming
Nature can do without us. But we cannot do without nature. Wijeratne fervently believes in this. Mother Nature has a true ally in Wijeratne.
One thing I have a problem with is Global Warming. People put a lot of attention on things like feminism and inequality. But what we neglect is global warming. There is mass deforestation and that is something I feel very strongly about. Because I feel that even though a lot of attention has been drawn to it, it is not in par with the attention drawn to issues like cancer. If you take all the fund raisers, a lot of it would be for cancer or for organ donations or even feminism. But people dont fight enough for deforestation and protecting our environment, because we cannot survive without it. That is something I feel strongly about, because we need to protect our forests, said Wijeratne.
There are many definitions of a leader. For Wijeratne it is strength and humility. She believes in inspiring people to follow her rather than forcing others to follow her.
There are a lot of things which define a leader so you need to be strong. And you need to take a leap of faith, but I think the most important would be to be humble. Because to be a leader you dont need to force others to follow you. You have to inspire others to follow you. If something goes wrong and you are in charge of it, you need to be humble enough to take blame for it, if something goes right you need to be humble enough to give others credit for it. That is what inspires others to look up to you. You have to be at their level and have them all turn to you. To be a leader the most important thing is to be humble, said Wijeratne.
The Count of Monte Cristo is a fantastic novel written by Alexandre Dumas that tells the story of Edmond Dantes, a man who was terribly wronged and imprisoned though he did nothing to deserve it. It is a tale of the triumph of the human spirit and the powerful will of a man. A story of adventure and intrigue.
My favorite book would be The Count of Monte Cristo, because it teaches you what cleverness is. The way he goes about revenge is brilliant. I enjoyed it when I was small and it has stuck with me ever since. There is revenge but there is love and that combination is really beautiful, said Wijeratne.

Seminar on productive work methods in Public Sector
The first seminar addressing how Lean methods to be used in the Public sector was delivered on the 14th December 2017 at the Hector Kobbekaduwa Institute on Wijerama Road from 8.30 to 4pm.
The National Human Resource and Development Council (NHRDC) chaired by Dinesh Weerakoddy coordinated this seminar for management staff from the public sector. The seminar was delivered by Arosha Jayasundera, Director of the Asian Institute of Excellence. Participants who attended the workshop included senior police officers, senior management from the Ministry of Environment and Disaster Management and from the Technical College, Maradana. A number of senior female staff from Ministries also attended the workshop. Several practical sessions were conducted with the participants to emphasize the need for increasing speed of transactions and to reduce waste.
This first seminar addressed the need to measure processes within departments and introduced staff to the importance of minimizing the Eight Lean Wastes which enables them to deliver more timely services. Sri Lanka trails badly in the World Competitive Index and is now 85th out of around 140 countries having slipped down in the last year. A very poor productivity level in the workforce is a major contributor to Sri Lankas low ranking. Sri Lanka ranks at 135 out of approximately 140 countries, in terms of labour productivity.
Arosha Jayasundera is a Lean Six Sigma ( Black Belt) who has been trained by Standard Chartered Bank, where she was Head of Project Management and Service Quality. Since then she has delivered a number of lectures for the banking and tourism sectors. She is also working with the Federation of Chambers of Sri Lanka, has been involved in setting up the South Asian Lean Construction Institute and was recently trained by the Asian Productivity Organisation( APO) to be a Productivity Judge, which was coordinated by the National Productivity Secretariat.
Productivity and Efficiency are critical factors for Sri Lankan companies to compete effectively in world markets. Technology alone cannot enable companies to be competitive. Use of Data analytics and appropriate KPI can provide critical insights into the efficiency of the day to day running of the organization. Effective branding is also built on a strong and fit organization and advertising is only sustainable in the medium to long term if the organization can deliver standard products at all times. Lean methodology is also very much part of the marketing mix and enables products and services to be delivered with additional value which then satisfies more customers and leads to better sales.
Arosha Jayasundera is also a Director of the Intrinsic Leadership Academy which provides training to Corporates on the Six Holistic Dimensions of Leadership.
From January 2018, this Academy will be rolling out a set of public courses which will transform Managers into Leaders during five 1-day workshops spread over a 5-week period. Arosha Jayasundera is also a Director of the Cambridge Institute which conducts courses for those requiring better English communication skills. Arosha Jayasundera was also recently featured on TV1 on a programme about Lean Construction and has written a number of articles on Productivity.

Shocked Gatlin sacks  coach after doping claim
LONDON, Tuesday: World 100 metres champion Justin Gatlin said on Tuesday he was shocked and surprised at doping allegations made against his coach Dennis Mitchell, like Gatlin a convicted doper, but added that he had sacked him as soon as he heard about the issue.
Britains Daily Telegraph set up a sting where they claim Mitchell, the American former medal-winning sprinter who was previously banned for doping, and sports agent Robert Wagner had offered to supply performance-enhancing drugs to undercover reporters claiming to be making a movie featuring a doped athlete.
Gatlin, 35, who won the world title in London this year against a backdrop of jeering relating to his two doping bans, issued a statement via Instagram where he said: I am not using and have not used PEDs (performance-enhancing drugs.
I was shocked and surprised to learn that my coach would have anything to do with even the appearance of these current accusations. I fired him as soon as I found out about this.

India vs Sri Lanka first Twenty20 International today
Skipper Thisara Perera confident of bouncing back
CUTTACK, Tuesday: Sri Lanka captain Thisara Perera insisted that his side would look to flush out the negativity following heavy defeats in the preceding Tests and ODIs and is confident of a comeback in the Twenty20 International series.
Sri Lanka lost the Test series 1-0 that was followed by the one-dayers which the visitors lost 2-1 against India. Sri Lanka caught India unawares with a surprise bowling effort in the first One-day International, but could not capitalise on the momentum.
As the long tour enters its final leg, both teams are looking to shift to T20 mode.
It was a bad ODI series but we have to take good things from the first match. There were a lot of positives. We have to flush out the negatives. It's a new series and we hope to start well, Perera said on the eve of the Twenty20 International series opener at the Barabati Stadium.
We have good talents, death bowlers, power hitters. We will do our best tomorrow (Wednesday). I've to give more confidence to the young players. I don't think they have pressure, they have to give 100 per cent. Personally I know they have good mindset and they can come very strongly.
We got a good start but then we didn't execute our plans, that's the main reason why we lost. It won't happen again and again. It was a one-off game, Perera said two days after India bounced back through spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav.
India have rested many of their main team players, including skipper Virat Kohli and Perera said: We don't think about just one player. We are concentrating on playing our game. I want to play my natural game.
Tharanga attacked the Indian bowling en route his 82-ball 95 and Perera gave credit to their batting coach Thilan Samaraweera.
He made some technical changes which was the main reason to his success. I've to thank our batting coach.
Sri Lanka trained in the morning session but the team think tank sent a few players in the evening to check on dew.
With a 7pm start, both teams will have to deal with dew. We have to look for a good start and build pressure. The main target is to get 150-plus.
With the Test and ODI series in pocket, India will aim for another dominant performance and look to bag the T20 series as well. Without the services of skipper Virat Kohli, India did not have a dream start to their ODI series campaign at Dharamsala but bounced back in style as stand-in skipper Sharma took the attack to the opposition with his fearless batting.
However, Twenty20 is a different ball game and India would look for a smooth transition to the shortest format, having endured a batting disaster in the first one-dayer.
India do not have a happy memory of the solitary Twenty20 International at the Barabati Stadium. The Men in Blue had folded for 92 against South Africa in 2015 as crowd trouble brought infamy to the venue.
India lead Sri Lanka 7-4 on head-to-head count and are yet to lose against them in the last four outings, the hosts will aim to give a better account of their batting.
The T20 squad will also see different players in action. Saurashtra left-arm pacer Jaydev Unadkat, who last played in a T20I against Zimbabwe in June last year, has been recalled and India have three first-timers in Washington Sundar, Basil Thampi and Deepak Hooda.

SLC financially  stable  - Sumathipala
President Thilanga Sumathipala said that Sri Lanka Cricket was today a stable institution and could carry on without being dependent on anyone for the next 5-10 years.
I am proud to say that today we are not indebted to anyone. We have settled all our debts. Our financial position is very strong and the SLC can continue for the next 5-10 years without depending on anyone, said Sumathipala in an interview.
The most important thing in an institution is financial stability. Today we have no player problems. When we look at individual talents and inborn talents we have a very good team today.
As president I have more than 20 years experience at SLC. I know where I should rebuild the cracks. I take full responsibility of putting the team back on the winning track because I am the most experienced person in cricket administration in the whole world. I know what to do and what not to do. The SLC ExCo is also guiding and assisting me to follow the correct path, he said.
Speaking further Sumathipala said, I took over Sri Lanka Cricket after 11 years when it was in dire financial straits. SLC was Rs. 4.5 million in debt. An office worker functioned as a national trainer. All units in SLC were in disarray. Loans amounting to several millions of rupees had been taken to build the Sooriyawewa Stadium. There were no proper infrastructure facilities. Nothing was heard about school cricket. There were problems about match fixing. Several cases were pending in the FCID.
I admit that the team was suffered setbacks in recent times. One of the reasons for the setbacks is the mental distress caused to Angelo Mathews by singularly targeting him. He was labeled as a match fixer. Some former cricketers came forward and criticized him in a very unfair manner. When the captain is targeted the whole team suffers a setback. When the captain lost the toss he is labeled as a man who had given up the game. I had to intervene to rebuild the mentality of the cricketers. I discussed with the players and I am trying to discuss things with the ICC and clear players of all allegations and start a new journey. This is not an easy job. Our main target is to win the 2019 World Cup. The country or a team should have a development target to achieve progress. My main objective is to transform the Sri Lanka team as the best Test team in the world. We have to build up the best ODI and T20 team in the world. Thereafter our objective is to win the Under 19 World Cup.
Other units in the SLC also have such targets. One should have faith in me and my team. They should also have faith in the cricketers. We have many shortcomings which will take about 6-8 months to fulfill. This is a time consuming job. We should select the best 20 players suitable to take part in the 2019 World Cup. We have only 45 ODI matches prior to the next World Cup. The 20 member team selected must play at least 30 out of 40 one day matches. A person who has no experience in at least 30 matches cannot be brought into the final 15 member team.
The SLC is the only Cricket Board in the world where former cricketers are working. There are so many members of the Sri Lanka team Asanka Gurusinha is the cricket manager, Chandika Hathurusingha has come back to take over as head coach. There is Thilan Samaraweera and Rumesh Ratnayake who are the batting and bowling coaches. The lower rungs of the SLC also comprise several players who have represented Sri Lanka, Sumathipala said.
The SLC president said as regards fitness they had no clear program of work. It is the Minister of Sports who intervened and settled the problem by taking a firm stand. All in all our cricketers were not used to fitness exercises. Senior players put on weight with time. The fitness standards have been systematically upgraded from September 1. We will not select anyone who does not conform to the fitness levels.
Fitness tests will be held on February 1, April 1 and June 1 according to the Ministers circular. This decision has helped to energize the players. This will also help improve the fielding. These standards should be introduced to the A team too.
Correcting these things is very difficult. When we set about doing these things people blamed the coach. Everyone tried to chase Gurusinha away. I brought back Gurusinha to build up discipline. It is the manager who is acting as our agent to implement our policy. He should rebuild discipline and fitness.
We cannot play cricket with people who are drunk the whole night and break rest the whole night. People planned to chase Gurusinha because he insisted in instilling discipline. Gurusinha is a person who has followed the Level 3 training course and undertaken Cricket Management in Australia for 20 years. He is a Sri Lankan, a member of the World Cup winning team. When we asked people to take up new technology those who could not fathom it organized themselves to oppose it, said Sumathipala.
My main responsibility is to do the correct thing without concern about undue criticism.
If I give into criticism I wont be able to achieve the main target of bringing the team on the winning path. If I give into pressure and give up my post I will be doing a grave injustice to the country as a most experienced person in cricket administration. So I have decided to perform my duties by keeping silent. There is no other person experienced as me to take over this post. The best thing is to get things corrected by supporting me in this task. People off the field of cricket are well aware of the damage that will be caused if I leave this post.
As such most of them have offered me their support and encouraged me to continue this work. I will definitely take the team forward to the 2019 World Cup, he said. Speaking on Thisara Pereras captaincy Sumathipala said what the team needed was a strategist who can unite the team as captain. At present Thisara Perera has performed this job well. He is a fearless leader with a strong backbone. He showed fearless leadership qualities by taking the team to Pakistan.
Fearlessness is one trait required in a captain and Thisara has it. This is not a Test squad but a One Day squad. Thisara may have other shortcomings which can be corrected by the coach.
We have brought in an efficient coach and I am confident that we will be able to build up a proper team. It will be almost 90 percent complete after the Independence Trophy next year, he concluded.

SLPP restricts digital devices at party pocket meetings
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has restricted digital devices at their party pocket meetings where certain politicians who still hold SLFP membership participate in, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday said.
The restriction has also been extended to media coverage for such meetings as well, he added.
The restriction has come at the wake of President Maithripala Sirisenas decision not to tolerate the behavior of certain politicians who support other political parties while holding the SLFP membership, Minister Samarasinghe pointed out.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party recently announced that they are to take strict disciplinary action against SLFP members who promote other political parties and political visions while holding SLFP membership. Attention was also drawn to the use of electronic evidence, such as video and audio recordings, when inquiring into such behavior of those politicians. Certain SLFP politicians who support Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna did not appear when their candidates submitted nominations. These politicians did not go anywhere near the Divisional Secretariats where nominations were accepted. Minister Samarasinghe observed.
These politicians have become so fearful of the idea of using electronic evidence being used against them; they have banned any digital device from the meetings they participate in. Apparently, there is a security body check done on supporters who attend Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna meetings. The supporters are to leave all their digital devices outside the meeting place. In these circumstances, it is obvious that media personnel are not allowed to cover these meetings as well, Minister Samarasinghe explained.
Samarasinghe pointed out that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna is now on the verge of political bankruptcy with its ridiculous ways. They even use the colour blue to decorate their party offices, Samarasinghe exclaimed. Minister Samarasinghe was speaking at a media brief held at the SLFP Headquarters last afternoon. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna supporter, Western Provincial Council (WPC) Deputy Chairman Yasapala Koralage yesterday said that he has been given the post of SLFP Organizer to the Horana electorate. Koralage pointed out that they will not allow any conspiracy to divide the SLFP to succeed.
If the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna leader is former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, his cut outs should appear at our party offices. But, the only face that appears at them is of late Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickramanayakes, who had nothing to do with this party. We are striving for an SLFP government, not a UNP one. I am sure, when we win the Local Government election, all Pohottuwa supporters in Horana will come and join me in the process of developing our area, Koralage said.
Western Provincial Council Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna has lost its momentum. There is no such thing as Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna now. People have lost faith in it. All SLFP supporters should defeat the conspiracy to divide our party and take the SLFP to victory, Devapriya said.

Sri Lankan born Australian author guest speaker at Asia Pacific Writers
Indonesia's fabled Paradise Island, Bali, which attracts thousands of tourists seems never out of the lime light. But a few days ago Bali had a scare. This was due to the fear that a volcano would erupt. It did cause a degree of panic. The Bali Airport too was closed. Fortunately the volcano did not erupt and the Airport re-opened and thousands of visitors relieved.
Back in October Bali was once again in the news. But this was on account of a happier event. The Asia Pacific writers and translators conference (APWT) was held for the 10th time in Bali from October 22 to 24. And it attracted the cream of literary figures, specifically with in the vast Asia Pacific region and also the rest of the world.
APWT according to the organizers is now one of Asia's longest running and most unique literary networking events.
Sri Lankan literary circles should be pleased that a rising novelist born in this country, Rajith Savanadasa was a guest speaker at the conference.
Rajith, whose debut novel, Ruins, was subject to critical international acclaim was named one of the Sydney Herald Young novelists of 2017, delivered the keynote address on the second day of the conference.
APTW this year brought together nearly 200 participants from around the world. The conference title was Global-local sharing stories with the world'.
The organizers say that throughout the history of APWT, one of the main aims was to open-up a dialogue between international participants and local writers and cultural producers. With this objective an extra effort was made to achieve local engagement through Indonesian participation this year.
The organization paid a special tribute to the support and assistance extended by individuals and allied institutions in the region.
The October programme laid special emphasis on indigenous, narratives. Up front in this connection was the effort of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia-ASEAN Council.
This enabled indigenous writer in Australia to be featured in Bali, who shared their stories with the audiences.
Among the eleven such writers was Rajith Savanadasa who lives in Melbourne.
Several Australian Universities gave active support to the project. Among them were the University of New South Wales, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia National University of Technology, RMIT University and Griffith University, all of which contributed financially towards the organization.
The Australian Council for the arts and the Department of Foreign Affairs too supported the event financially.
The event was envisioned by Jean carmens. She also nurtured it over the years. Dr Sanaz Fotonhnhi was it's Director this year and the organization management committee included another of Sri Lankan origin, the well known writer Nury Vittachi who is Hong Kong based.

Sri Lanka's growth likely to be  weak in 2018  - HSBC Global Research
SRI LANKA
A juggling act
Sri Lanka is walking on a tight rope, trying to balance the twin targets of invigorating growth in the economy while maintaining macro-economic stability.
On the one hand, the economy has been weakened by floods and droughts for the past two years. This has resulted in a complete disruption of agriculture, which has been contracting for six consecutive quarters now.
And on the other hand, vulnerabilities around macro-economic fundamentals in the form of high debt to GDP ratio, the twin deficit problem (current and fiscal deficit), a weak currency and insufficient forex reserves have kept Sri Lanka on its toes.
To fix the latter, Sri Lanka entered into the IMF reform program in 2016. Much has been done and achieved since then. Dedicated efforts have been made towards revenue mobilisation via VAT hikes and passing of the Inland Revenue Act in the Parliament, reducing fiscal deficit and embarking a more realistic consolidation path, building-up of foreign reserves and showcasing a greater commitment towards exchange rate flexibility.
While the government remains committed to the IMFs recommended structural reforms, growth is likely to be weak in 2018 due to a fragile agriculture recovery, lower household spending and moderating credit growth especially in the services sector. The reinstatement of the EUs Generalised System of Preferences (GSP+) in May 2017 is likely to revive exports. In fact, high frequency data so far have been promising, with export growth outpacing import growth, but its too early to be confident about the recovery.
The 2018 budget also tries to stimulate growth, that too on a sustainable basis. It aims at rekindling entrepreneurial spirit by improving access to credit for small- and medium-sized enterprises, enhancing trade competitiveness by the removal of tariffs, promoting tourism and attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) by doing away with land ownership restrictions and by exploring opportunities around public private partnership.
Undoubtedly, the country has come a long way trying to achieve both the objectives of growth and macro-economic stability, but things can get tricky going forward as close to LKR 7,000 bn will be due for repayment in the next couple of years. Such a huge gross financing need may require further revenue consolidation, which may be detrimental for an already slowing economy.
Sri Lanka needs to attract non-debt creating inflow and FDI is one such option. However, it has always lagged in attracting FDI compared to its neighbours. With targeted FDI inflows not being realised, it has relied on commercial borrowing to fund its deficits (balance of payments and budget deficit) to drive growth. This has not been sustainable and has led to steep adjustments in the currency and the interest rate in the last seven years or so.
Policy issues
Since 2016, the central bank has raised policy rates by 125bp with an aim of reducing excess liquidity, controlling credit expansion and to contain the build-up of adverse inflation expectations. While concerns around Sri Lankas credit euphoria have been mitigated by a tighter monetary policy, inflation has continued to edge higher, much outside the central banks target of mid-single digit.
Its the supply side disruptions due to unfavourable weather conditions that have driven food prices higher, and thereby inflation. We believe that, as food prices stabilise in the months to come, inflation will start moderating and is likely to ease to the desired levels by 2018.
Sri Lankas rate hike cycle is close to peaking and the central bank is likely to keep the policy rates unchanged in the foreseeable future till the dust around supply side disruptions due to adverse weather conditions settle. A stable rate environment will also support the weak economic recovery.
Risks
Rising crude and commodity prices, along with a depreciating currency, may worsen current deficit levels, and the government may find it difficult to continue with energy price reforms per the scheduled timeline.
Also, a weaker than expected recovery in growth as a consequence of adverse weather conditions and a loose fiscal policy as the country moves closer to elections could further slowdown the pace of fiscal consolidation and raise concerns around macro-economic stability.
INDIA
Between two worlds
Indias growth story has a two-part narrative. The first is a slowdown and gradual recovery in the short run, likely over FY18 and FY19, as key sectors revive from disruptions related to the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST). The subsequent narrative is of brighter growth prospects in the medium term (FY20 and beyond), when growth is expected to reap the benefits of recently undertaken structural reforms.
The coming into force of the GST in July 2017 slowed manufacturing activity sharply. Growth was at its slowest pace in five years in Q1 FY18 due to a massive inventory drawdown, only to pick up to a healthy 7% in Q2. However, although the sectors Q2 growth print was satisfactory, this was not true for underlying momentum and scope. High frequency indicators such as industrial production reveal that around 40% of manufacturing sectors are still contracting while the remaining 60% are growing at a much slower pace than before. The recently announced USD32bn banks
recapitalisation scheme and amendments in the bankruptcy code should help bad-loans-ridden public-sector banks and support a revival of investment by improving credit flow in the economy.
However, the revival may be only gradual at first, as the other side of Indias twin balance sheet problem  the overleveraged corporates  is expected to linger for longer. However, reforms alone are not to blame. The rapid fall in oil prices, which supported net exports and domestic manufacturing, has reversed. With oil prices no longer falling, an important growth driver is lost, and nothing appears to be taking its place. Export growth has also slowed substantially, dragged down by domestic bottlenecks, stronger rupee and GST-disruptions.
Brighter growth prospects appear on a three-year-plus horizon (FY20 and beyond). In the medium term, GST alone may add 40bp to GDP growth through productivity gains. Then, India can be more integrated with the rest of the world by virtue of its evolving IT software exports, impressive consumption trends, vibrant start-up ecosystem, and strong demand for global capital and capital goods as the domestic investment cycle turns.
This is subject to caveats, the most important being that India must address the issue of insufficient social capital constraints; accordingly, we forecast growth at 6.5%, 7.0% and 7.6% over FY18, FY19, and FY20, respectively.
Policy issues
The inflation outlook in India has been muddied by many transient and structural factors. While its hard to disentangle the impact of each of these in the recent trend, we now see upside risks to inflation again. While core inflation has already climbed back above 4% and remains sticky, increasing fuel prices pose a greater risk. If food prices also begin to settle higher, possibly on the back of higher prices of perishable items such as vegetables, we could easily see 4%-plus inflation prints, due partly to unfavourable base effects.
However, we believe that, once the impact of transient factors wanes, inflation will settle in the proximity of the RBIs 4% target, thanks largely to the virtuous fall in inflation expectations in recent years. We expect inflation to average 3.4% over FY18 (ending the year in March at 4.3%).
Accordingly, we forecast that the RBI will keep the repo rate on hold, as the rate-cutting cycle of the central bank looks set to have ended, with most inflation risks tilted to the upside.
Hikes may also be unwarranted at the moment because we have yet to see whether the current pace of economic growth is sustainable or it turns out to be as rapid as the central bank forecasts.
Indias current account deficit (CAD) is set to widen to 1.7% in FY18 and to 1.9% in FY19, and then reach 2.1% in FY20.
This would be led largely by rising imports of oil and items such as electronic goods and smartphones, reflecting changing consumer preferences domestically. Yet, riding on optimism from recent reforms and Moodys sovereign rating upgrade, we expect financial flows into the economy to stay strong, at least roughly sufficient to finance the CAD.
On the fiscal front, there are upside risks to the central governments 3.2% deficit target emanating from lower-than-budgeted nominal GDP growth, a lower-than-budgeted RBI dividend, and a higher seventh pay commission bill. On the other hand, increased momentum in government-led disinvestment and GST revenue may result in higher revenues, but its too early to be sure.
State government deficits are already high and could worsen on the back of farm loan waivers.
Risks
If the other side of Indias twin balance sheet problem  overleveraged companies lingers for longer, the pace of the investment revival and GDP recovery could suffer.
Also, inflation may begin to rise as growing consumer demand hits the wall of supply-side constraints.
CHINA
A positive outlook for 2018
The Chinese economy staged a robust growth recovery in 2017, with real GDP growing 6.9% in the first three quarters of the year and nominal growth averaging 11.4% y-o-y. Underpinning this rebound are a private-sector-led manufacturing recovery, an export recovery, and strong public-sector infrastructure spending. We expect the manufacturing recovery to strengthen in 2018.
This additional pillar of growth, alongside stable growth in the domestic services sector, should help to offset the impact of policy tightening and SOE de-leveraging. We see real GDP growth at 6.7% in 2018. After a five-year-long downturn, manufacturing investment growth rebounded in mid-2016 and grew 4% in the first 10 months of 2017.
The modest rebound in headline growth masks a sharper divergence between the SOE-dominated old sectors, such as steel, metals, chemical and plastic, and the private sector-led new sectors, including machinery, electronics and Information
Communication Technology (ICT) related equipment.
The old sectors have been slowing since 2011 and contracted by 0.4% in the first ten months of the year. The new sectors have also slowed over the past few years (although they still grew at a faster pace than the old sectors) but rebounded in mid-2016, and grew 8.4% in the first ten months of 2017.
A similar divergence can be observed in industrial production as well as export data, suggesting that upgrading is now a bigger driver of Chinas manufacturing growth. We expect the recovery in this part of the economy to strengthen in 2018, helped by domestic upgrading and also stable external demand.
Meanwhile, after a strong performance in 2017, we expect the housing market to slow in 2018. Housing sales have started to slow in a more broad-based manner, while housing starts growth has also eased. Both point to a moderate slowdown in housing investment in 2018. Moreover, sustained reflation will give policy makers more space to adjust policy. We expect the current policy stance, which is neutral, but with a tightening bias in the interbank and regulatory space, to largely continue in 2018. De-leveraging of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) will also gain pace. On the fiscal side, tighter regulations for Public Private Partnership projects may have some near-term impact on infrastructure investment.
But, for full year 2018, the expansionary fiscal policy stance should largely continue. We also expect more to be done to lower corporates tax burden and incentivise innovation and green investment through tax rebate or subsidies.
Policy issues
The PBoCs monetary policy stance in 2017 is officially neutral. In practice, this has often come with a tightening bias in the interbank and regulatory space. Our HSBC China Monetary Conditions Indicator, for example, shows continuous tightening over the year. Given the robust reflationary backdrop, the impact on the real economy was largely manageable. We expect this policy stance to largely continue in 2018. The risk is for a more hawkish tone at the upcoming National Peoples Congress (NPC) session in March 2018. The fiscal book has turned around quite meaningfully in 2017 and should continue to grow in 2018 given the positive growth trajectory. The Ministry of Finance has tightened regulations around Public Private Partnership projects recently, which may have some negative near-term impact on infrastructure investment in early 2018 but marginal in the context of full year spending.
We expect the expansionary fiscal policy stance to continue. We also expect more to be done to lessen the tax burden on the corporate sector and incentivise R&D spending.
Risks
With simultaneous tightening of financial and environmental regulations, there is a risk that policy goes into overdrive, derailing the growth recovery. If the upcoming NPC session sends a more hawkish policy signal, investors worries could deepen. This would create some downside risks, particularly in 1H 2018.
The ongoing recovery in the global capex cycle has been positive for China. It may receive a further boost if China also moves to lower corporate taxes in a more meaningful way. A further acceleration in the global capex cycle is another upside risk for China.

SriLankan, a billion dollar company soon
The SriLankan Airline revenue is growing and it is on track to be a billion dollar company this financial year, said Capt. Suren Ratwatte, Chief Executive Officer, SriLankan Airlines.
In an interview he states that their cost base has remained untrimmed over the years. In a market where the yields remain poor, but fuel prices are rising, this is no longer tenable. Reducing our costs while maintaining our standards and not compromising on the product, is a huge challenge that we must all focus on.
The focus for 2018 must be consolidation and transformation. Our shareholder, the Government of Sri Lanka, has recognised the need for the airline to restructure, as the burden on the national economy will become unbearable unless losses are contained. To this end, the services of world-renowned consultant to assist the management in this task, has been secured.
The high lease costs of our fleet, is something the consultant will assist us in addressing.
The government is committed to solving the cost of capital and the interest cost of our debt. Reducing our corporate costs and transforming ourselves into a much leaner, fitter and more nimble airline, which can respond quickly to changing market forces, is a task we must accomplish ourselves. Once these issues are addressed, we will be in a position to start growing again and assert our role as a major player in the Indian Ocean arena, he predicted.We started the year with a challenge that the airline had never faced before, the closure of the only runway at Colombo recalling the early year of 2017 he said the year started with Bandaranaike International Airport for much needed resurfacing.
The 8-hour daily closure over 90 days meant that the airport had to accommodate 24 hours of operations in 16 hours.
The greatest challenge of this was for SriLankan as it meant that we had to cancel a large number of flights, over 600 in the three-month period, in order to fit into the reduced operational period. Needless to say, this resulted in a major loss of revenue. It also brought about cost complexities, as we had high cost assets, aircraft & crew being under-utilised due to the cancellations.
The onus was on SriLankans Ground Services division  who had to ensure that not only our own, but also all other airlines flights were serviced and that they departed on time.
As a result of adequate pre-planning and proactive management, SriLankan was able to conduct a very smooth operation during this period, for itself and all airlines serving Colombo, with nearly 100% punctuality. However, the reduction in operations resulted in a severe loss of revenue which marred what could have been a stellar financial year for us.
The major achievement of the year was the validation of the Colombo Hub concept. As part of this strategy, SriLankan implemented one of the biggest expansions of its route network in recent years.

Stolen wealth
Nobody really knows how much money public officials have stolen and hidden outside of Sri Lanka.
Previous government estimates made in 2015, put the number at a minimum of $ 10 billion. For a comparison, thats about the cost of eight Hambantota Port projects.
But theres a chance that some of that money, which is held in offshore bank accounts, could be seized and brought back to Sri Lanka.
At a recent conference in Washington, D.C., Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya said that Sri Lankas financial crimes units have made 34 mutual legal assistance requests to other countries on international asset recovery cases.
Asset recovery, or the process of retrieving money that was taken by public officials through corruption and hidden in offshore bank accounts, requires intense collaboration between foreign countries and banks and the home jurisdiction.
Speaking at an international conference on asset recovery earlier this month, Attorney General Jayasuriya said, Sri Lanka is trying hard to achieve the objective that we all are gathered here and expecting to achieve: the fight against corruption and to have the stolen assets being brought back to the jurisdiction, to the benefit of its rightful owners.
Asset recovery around the world
Executive Director of Transparency International Sri Lanka,Asoka Obeyesekera.
Asset recovery is a complex, tedious, and hard-fought process. It requires legal cooperation between law enforcement agencies, banks and lawyers across international borders.
Perhaps the most famous example of asset recovery, which may hold important lessons for Sri Lankas new attempts at asset recovery, is the case of former Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
Marcos ruled the Philippines with an iron fist for more than 20 years, amassing an estimated $ 10 billion while in office. After a revolution overthrew him in 1986, he and his wife Imelda fled their presidential palace as the military turned against them, bringing along jewellery, ivory and gold bricks.
One of the first moves new President Corazon Aquino made was to establish a Presidential Commission on Good Government, tasked with finding and returning Marcos stolen billions to the Philippines.
30 years later the commission is still running and has recovered about $ 4 billion; less than half of what experts think Marcos accumulated through corruption and graft. Nobody from the Marcos family or their associates, has been imprisoned for their crimes.
Asset recovery in Sri Lanka
Legal analysts say that in Sri Lanka, the current framework of laws will slow down any attempt at asset recovery.
Asoka Obeyesekera, the Executive Director of the anti-corruption non-profit Transparency International Sri Lanka, said asset recovery under the current system requires a criminal conviction in court: a process that can take many, many years.
But according to him, We dont need to depend on criminal justice proceedings to ensure that assets can be recovered and returned to Sri Lanka.
Obeyesekera said that countries around the world are turning towards civil law to recover stolen assets, in what is known in legal jargon as non-conviction based civil forfeiture.
The idea of putting somebody behind bars and recovering stolen assets are linked issues, however they require very different approaches, he said in an interview. On the legislative side, there is a need to look at newer innovations in anti-corruption work.
The World Banks Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative recognizes the statutory need to convict, as one of the main barriers faced by countries for asset recovery.
In most jurisdictions, a criminal conviction must be obtained before stolen assets can be confiscated, analysts for the World Bank write in a 2011 report. Convictions can be especially problematic if corrupt officials prevent or delay criminal investigations.
The authors recommend lowering the burden of proof for the United National Convention against Corruption offences, which Sri Lanka is signed on to, and to shift the burden of proof so that the alleged offender must prove that his or her assets are in fact from a legitimate source.
The World Bank estimates that $20 to $40 billion is lost to developing countries each year through corruption. Changing Sri Lankas legal framework, they suggest, could begin to bring some of that money back.
Attorney General Jayasuriya recognized this as well in his speech in D.C. earlier this month.
The need to further enhance and strengthen this legal regime has been well recognized and acknowledged in the recent past, he said.The insufficiency of the current legislation in relation to stolen property to deter offenders and serve the needs of the society was further highlighted.
Presidents task force
J.C. Weliamuna, the Chairman of the Presidential Task Force for the Recovery of Illegally Acquired State Assets, said that even though the international asset recovery process in Sri Lanka is young, its off to a solid start.
Its only in the last two and a half years that most of these things are being addressed positively, he said in an interview.
But, Weliamuna also acknowledged that Sri Lanka faces significant barriers to asset recovery.
At the moment we dont have a proceeds of crime law here, he said. We are in the process of drafting one and by mid-next year that law will come into operation.
He said the recent asset recovery conference in D.C. was encouraging and gave Sri Lanka, as one of the four countries highlighted, a unique international platform.
Previously our investigators had no international exposure. But meeting with World Bank representatives and foreign investigative counterparts face-to-face would do much to ease asset recovery cases in the future, he said.
He pointed to the recent and successful conclusion of a Nigerian case involving Swiss banks as an inspiration.
On December 4th, the Swiss and Nigerian government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the World Bank to return to Nigeria $ 321 that was taken by military ruler Sani Abacha.
With all these things, we will reap the harvest in due course, Weliamuna said.
The future
Asset recovery requires a lot of political will. The cases of Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos or Nigerian military leader Sani Abacha, for example, didnt get off the ground until they were run out of power, or dead.
Obeyesekera, of Transparency International, worries that the lack of public communication by the government now, could jeopardize Sri Lankas cases in the future.
Public communication is essential, he said. Because even if there was a change of government tomorrow, and as there is zero public communication at the moment, all of the work that has been done up to now would amount to nothing, because nobody has communicated anything.
We have a government that has its entire mandate anchored on anti-corruption, he added. Asset recovery is a key component of it and you need to be able to communicate some momentum.
Disclosing specific names and amounts of money could harm investigations.
But you can give out certain amounts of information without jeopardizing investigations, Obeyesekere said. Knowing just how much is out there and how many cases the government has opened, could be a start.

Sunflower cultivation a profitable option
An experiment done by the Mapalana Agriculture Faculty of the Ruhuna University has proved that 40 percent more oil can be extracted from the Sunflower seeds than from coconut.
The experiment was conducted by a team led by Senior Professor K.D.N. Weerasinghe.
By distributing sunflower seeds among farmers, Prof. Weerasenghe said that at a time when the price of coconuts have increased in an unprecedented manner, the country could easily seek substitutes like the sunflower to provide edible oil.
He said that each sunflower has 200 to 300 seeds and pointed out that many areas in the country are conducive for sunflower plantation.

Tragedies not so uncommon
I may dare not agree with most local book publishers and readers when they say that the literary genre known as short story cannot be promoted and sold in the book market. The great short story writers such as Anton Chekhov from Russia and Guy du Maupassant from France have, over the years, proved that a commonplace slice of life - if sensitively created - may lead to penetrative insights. That is required from creative thinking.
The fact that the novel as a creative writing may have a popular appeal cannot be undermined. But the verdict cannot be passed in the taste and judgement on an aesthetic plane as regards the short story. I felt that good short story creations come as a gift from writers who consider the form of expression seriously. Right at the moment, I take the example set by the Sinhala writer Nihal Gunasekara on reading his latest collection of short stories titled as Yasohamige Kathava Saha Tavat Katha (The Story of Yasohami and Other Stories).
Impending calamities
The title story of Yasohami revolves round the day to day life of an ageing mother and her three sons whose lives are portrayed as struggles. The mother sees and feels her surroundings torn between the day to day events and the impending calamities. Her eldest son, married, is drunkard more often than not with a pregnant wife.
The mother expects him to see her in a sober mood which she never faces. The second son, though not a drunkard, is being jilted by his girlfriend making him a mental sufferer. He is leading an agonised life looking after his ageing mother, who so desires to see him getting married.
But it never gets materialised. She sees how her son avoids the company of merrymakers and makes use of his isolation in a meditative mood. The third son has joined the army forces and is heard to be leading the life of a combat soldier, a would-be-hero, who is also torn between the world of life and death. The ageing mother desires to know war news over the radio.
But she is sometimes sleepless, and restless, contemplating on the destiny of the youngest son of hers. She is accustomed to praying and religious deeds as she feels that it is the only way out of the calamity. But what does happen She comes to know that the wife of the drunken elder son has given birth to a deformed, disabled, child. The youngest son has become an amputee - news brought over by the police officers and sent by the Army Headquarters in the distant war torn areas.
Plight befallen
The ageing mother who has solace from his mentally disturbed second son tries to adjust herself from the calamity via the understanding of the plight befallen. The reader too is made to feel that the essence of living depends on the feel of the pulse of the existing moment. The man lives from moment to moment.
The creative short story writer, Nihal Gunasekara, has shown in his short narratives, the selection of commonplace situations could be transformed into sensitive perceiving of human situations. Two good examples could be drawn from the short stories titled as Issaraha Gedara (The House in Front) and Nadagan (Good for Nothing Affairs).
The portrayal of characters and situations are found, though as mundane, nevertheless envelope sensitive inner layers of expression.
The best short in the collection is titled as Muhunu Pothaka Avataraya (The Facebook Avatar). The central experience centres found a young girl who is shown as addicted to the use of facebook in her phone. She is isolated and for a long time cut off from the family matters. Her mother is worried. Her father has gone abroad to make a living for the betterment. Her bribes and sisters are worried over her behaviour. The most innocent of them happen to be the mother, who never knows what actually happens. One day, the protagonist the girl, enmeshed in the facebook, sees her own photograph being dismantled to the point that she sees a nude body attached to her. She in dismay does not know what had befallen. In order to relieve out of the tragedy, it is claimed that she should give Rs 50,000. She falls down from her dream.
Forgetful image
She is disillusioned by the dismay that she has to undergo. From hitherto onwards, she discards the face book letting go off the suffering completely forgetful of her image. The story is well written containing a layer of human interest. I use this creative piece as a classroom exercise in creative communication.
As stated by literary critic, Malcolm Bradbury, the short story has become an adventurous, inventive, very various and, above all, a discovering form.

## Title: Twenty-Five-year old Gratiaen

Twenty-Five-year old Gratiaen
Michael Ondaatje in his literary generosity founded the establishment of the Gratiaen Prize in 1992.
The Gratiaen Trust was set-up and arrangements were made to have an annual competition to select the best English book; novel, poetry, a play or a collection of short stories written by a Sri Lankan. Rules and regulations have been established by the Gratiaen Trust, but I am not conversant with all their details. Year in and year out the competition has been held and the 2017 award will be its 25th anniversary. Yes, the Gratiaen is twenty-five years old and is still going strong. The entries for this years competition will close on December 31.
Local literati
During the past quarter century, the Gratiaen has done yeomen service in the encouragement given to local literati. New authors came to the limelight, poets got published, dramatists received recognition and the short-story teller found his or her audience. They all vied for the coveted Gratiaen Prize and each year the winner was celebrated, the short-listed were honoured, and the rest who competed walked away to write another day.
The entry for the competition does not need to be a published volume, as even work in manuscript is acceptable to the Trust and its judges. This is a great incentive to the writer. As we all know, writing a book is no cake-walk, and even more difficult is the task of convincing a publisher to accept a book, especially if you are a first-timer. Gratiaen therefore gives more opportunity to the novice by bringing the bar down. The fairy tale of the Gratiaen is simple, writes your piece, page-set and gets it printed in double space and photocopied in quadruplicate. Log into the Gratiaen website and follow instructions and submit your entry. Who knows You might be the winner of the 25th Gratiaen Prize!
Corporate entities
The event set-up by Booker-winning Ondaatje has been sponsored by many corporate entities and the current God-Father is Sarasavi Books. They ushered generous cash prizes, and added the icing on the cake by making a pledge to publish the winning entry as well as those short-listed, if they were still in manuscript, and of course if the respective authors were happy to get their books published by Sarasavi.
This is a gymkhana for the authors, to get the reputed Sarasavi to do all the nitty-gritty of printing and publishing their Gratiaen-recognized work and marketing them as a Sarasavi product.
The Gratiaen is judged by a panel of three experts appointed by the Trust Committee giving due consideration to their varying expertise to be judges of this grand competition.
Whichever way one looks at it, picking a winner for the Gratiaen will always be a daunting task. Let alone the winner, the short-listing of five entries too is a nightmare to a judge making his or her best attempt to be fair and impartial in his selections. The reading itself is a heavy load as it comprises of more than fifty books. Among the judge opinions differ, and endless discussions take place till consensus is reached, and then and only then will the short list of five is announced. The judges do get a respite after the short listing is done, as there is about a month to go before the final selection of the over-all winner. It has been done 24 times and the 25th will not be different. It is certainly not always standing ovations and clapping hands for the judges and their judgement. But that is to be expected in a literary competition. Wasnt it Cervantes who said, one mans meat and drink Senor, is another mans poison.
Annual incentive
Every year there are three prestigious awards that are given to the best written work in English, The Gratiaen Prize, the State Literary Award and the Fairways Literary Award. I am not aware of any others, but I could be wrong. Which of the above three is more recognized is irrelevant. They are all great and is an annual incentive for people who write. Of course, the Gratiaen has been the oldest having served Sri Lankan English literature for twenty-five years. Will there be a continuation after a quarter of a century I sincerely hope so. It is too important an event to slip out of the back-door and go into oblivion.
Let us hope that the Gratiaen will continue and the writers will compete, and the judges will do justice to crown the King or the Queen of English writing in Sri Lanka for many years to come.
It is an august event that has its pomp and pageantry, but undoubtedly it does serve the local English literati magnanimously.

Two passengers re-directed from Mattala to BIA
Two Sri Lankan passengers who attempted to travel to Dubai yesterday morning from the Mattala International Airport were disembarked. They were requested to go through the Bandaranaike International Airport instead, after officers found that one of the passengers had attempted to travel on the wrong visa category.
The two passengers, 22-year-old W. A. Nalaka and D. K. Shashikala, who were set to travel to Dubai through Fly Dubai Airline, were stopped by the Sri Lankan Foreign Employment Bureau officials yesterday morning at the Mattala Airport. The officers had reportedly informed the passengers that they could travel to the Middle East, if they were to go through the BIA instead.
The passengers had informed the officers that they were visiting relatives who were living and working in Dubai. They were, however, prevented from embarking and were directed to travel through the BIA. An official at the Fly Dubai office in Mattala said the officers, upon questioning the passengers, found out that one of them had intended to work in Dubai as a domestic but was travelling in the guise of being sponsored by her siblings.
One of the passengers said she was sponsored by her sibling and intended to work there, for which she needs a work visa to travel on. Regarding the other passenger, there was a discrepancy in his age, which was contrary to what was stated in the documents provided, he said. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Civil Aviation Authority Prabath Kularatne told the Daily News that passengers must check the port of origin on their tickets, a mistake many make. If the ticket says BIA, then they will not be able to disembark from Mattala and vice versa.
They need to make sure their documents are in order. And even still if they are inconvenienced, they are free to complain to the CAA in writing for which the CAA will conduct an inquiry for due investigations.

US vetoes UN Jerusalem resolution
UN: The United States on Monday vetoed a draft UN resolution rejecting President Donald Trumps decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital, after all 14 other Security Council members backed the measure.
The veto cast by US Ambassador Nikki Haley highlighted Washingtons isolation over Trumps announcement that the US embassy will be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, effectively ignoring Palestinian claims on the city. Soon after the clash at the top UN body, the White House announced that US Vice President Mike Pence was delaying a trip to the Middle East planned for this week.
Trumps December 6 decision to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital broke with international consensus, triggering protests across the Muslim world and drawing strong condemnation. Key US allies Britain, France, Italy, Japan and Ukraine were among the 14 countries in the 15-member council that voted in favor of the measure put forward by Egypt.
The draft resolution reaffirmed that Jerusalem is an issue to be resolved through negotiations and that any decisions on the status of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded. The United States will not be told by any country where we can put our embassy, Haley told the council after the veto.
What we witnessed here today in the Security Council is an insult. It wont be forgotten, she said, describing the measure as one more example of the United Nations doing more harm than good in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. To win the 14 votes, the text was watered down with no condemnation and no specific mention of Trumps move. Instead, it expressed deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem.
Resolutions presented to the council require nine votes for adoption, but the United States -- along with Britain, China, France and Russia -- have the power to veto any measure. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately thanked Haley, posting on Twitter: Truth defeated lies. Thank you, President Trump. Thank you, Nikki Haley. The Palestinians slammed the veto as unacceptable and vowed to turn to the UN General Assembly to win adoption for the resolution that was blocked at the council. No country has veto powers in the 193-nation assembly. Regrettably one state decided to oppose the whole world and to stand against the whole world with regard to this long-standing issue, Palestinian ambassador Riyad Mansour told the council.
Washingtons closest allies, France and Britain, came out ahead of the vote to declare their backing for the measure, which they stressed was in line with positions enshrined in UN resolutions adopted over several decades. Several UN resolutions call on Israel to withdraw from territory seized during the 1967 war. The status of the city must be decided through negotiations and not by the unilateral decision of a third country that would bring us back a century, said French Ambassador Francois Delattre.
The US veto came nearly a year after the previous US administration abstained in a council vote condemning Israeli settlements, allowing that measure to pass. Haley, who used her veto power for the first time as US ambassador, stressed that the United States still supports a two-state solution if thats what the parties agree to. The Palestinian envoy led a group of Arab ambassadors in a meeting with Miroslav Lajcak, the president of the General Assembly, to schedule a vote on the draft resolution, probably on Thursday. - AFP

Yemen rebel missile fired at Riyadh 'bears hallmarks' of Iran

A missile fired from Yemen at the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, bears the hallmarks of a weapon provided by Iran, the US ambassador to the UN has said. Nikki Haley said Iran's actions threatened to drag the world "deeper into a broadening regional conflict".
The missile was shot down by Saudi Arabia's military on Tuesday.
There were no reports of any damage. Iran denies arming Houthi rebels in Yemen who are fighting Yemen's government and a Saudi-led coalition.
The Houthis' Al Masirah TV reported that a Burkan H2 ballistic missile had been targeted at a royal palace in Riyadh.
Addressing the UN Security Council in New York, Mrs Haley said the missile "bears all the hallmarks of previous attacks using Iranian-provided weapons". "We must all act co-operatively to expose the crimes of the Tehran regime and do whatever is needed to make sure they get the message.
If we do not, then Iran will bring the world deeper into a broadening regional conflict," she said. She suggested a list of measures the council could take against Tehran but Russia, which has friendly relations with Iran, signalled it would not support them. A report on Al Masirah's website said the launch was "in response to the heinous crimes committed by the US-Saudi aggression against the people of Yemen".
The missile had targeted a "meeting of the leadership of the Saudi regime in al-Yamama Palace in Riyadh", during which Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was expected to discuss the kingdom's annual budget, Al Masirah said.
The palace is the main headquarters of the king's office and the royal court. Minutes later, Saudi state-run Al Ikhbariya TV reported that a missile had been intercepted south of the capital. Videos posted online showed a white cloud above the city and the sound of an explosion. Coalition spokesman Col Turki al-Maliki said the missile was intercepted by a Patriot missile south of the city.
He said the attack proved the "continued involvement" of Iran in supporting the Houthis. Another Burkan H2 came close to hitting Riyadh's King Khalid International Airport on 4 November. Saudi officials said US-supplied Patriot batteries had also intercepted the missile in flight.
But analysts have since cast doubt on that assertion and said the missile's warhead landed close to the domestic terminal. The US, which backs the coalition's military campaign in Yemen, later said it had "undeniable" evidence that the missile had been made in Iran.
Saudi Arabia intervened in its neighbour's civil war in March 2015 partly to counter perceived Iranian influence on the Houthis, which champion the Zaidi Shia minority. Iran has denied backing the rebels militarily and insisted that the missile launches are "independent actions" in response to Saudi-led coalition aggression.
More than 8,670 people have been killed and 49,960 injured since the coalition intervened in Yemen's war, according to the UN.
The fighting and the coalition blockade have also left 20.7 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have killed 2,219 people since April.

Zimbabwe seek to  end underdog tag
PAARL: Zimbabwe cricket coach Heath Streak said on Tuesday he wanted his players to play winning cricket when they meet South Africa in a one-off day-night Test next week.
We'd rather lose trying to play a winning brand of cricket than just compete, said Streak of a Test South Africa are expected to win comfortably.
The main thing is belief and shaking off that underdog mentality we had, he said in Paarl, the western Cape town where Zimbabwe begin a three-day warm-up match against a South African Invitation team on Wednesday.
Zimbabwe have played just ten Tests since they last met South Africa in Harare in August 2014, losing nine and drawing one.
It's well documented how little Test cricket we play, said Streak. I think for us it's less about the type of cricket than about playing at international level.
