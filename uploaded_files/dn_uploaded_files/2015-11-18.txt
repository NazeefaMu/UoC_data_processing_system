India and west jointly destroying our country
India is not pleased with the existence of the Avant Garde, as it poses a threat to their naval power in the Indian Ocean. The people are frequently asking us as to what was presently happening in the country. My answer to that question is that western countries are destroying our country with the assistance of India, Ven. Bengamuwenalaka Thera said.
Addressing a media conference in Colombo yesterday, the Ven. Thera said that western countries have given a contract to destroy Sri Lanka, as at present, only two historical cultures in the world remain intact. They being the Chinese culture and Sri Lankas Buddhist culture, while all other cultures in the world had already been destroyed. India plays the role of Sub Contractor of this contract, he said.
Local agents of the contract are a popular Buddhist monk and two Cabinet Ministers. The conspirators combined with the UNP and the SLFP to eliminate an opposition. The SLFP lacked the brains to sack President Sirisena from their chairmanship he said.
Tamil MPs travel abroad and lie about discrimination, but no Sinhala MP goes abroad and speak on behalf on their motherland and the Sinhalese. The Government blocked Wimal Weerawansa MP, when he attempted to go abroad. At present, we need more strength than we had before to face the LTTE terrorists Ven There said.
We need strength to face this challenge. If former President Rajapaksa contested alone, he could have won the election and become Prime Minister or at least the Opposition Leader. It was admitted by President Sirisena soon after the election. Only the United Opposition could save the country from being destroyed completely, he said.
Maduluwawe Dhammissara Thera said that the LTTE terrorists have turned political prisoners, while the moral of the war heroes have totally been destroyed. Over 100 Bodhi Poojas would be held countrywide to bless the war heroes. It is the Sinhalese who are going to lose their motherland, while their human rights are being violated, he said.
If all parliamentarians do not oppose the Geneva Resolution and if they take part in the so called All Party Conference, mother nature would punish them severely as she punished all those who attempted to destroy mother Lanka, he said.

Arjuna willing to help SLC develop school cricket
Minister of Ports and Shipping Arjuna Ranatunga said that he was willing to lend a helping hand to Sri Lanka Cricket to develop school cricket in the country.
School cricket standards have declined in the last few years, not only in Trincomalee but also in the entire country, said Minister Ranatunga speaking at a function held at the jetty of Trincomalee Harbour yesterday.
The reason is that some senior national players got involved in politics and dictated terms to the hierarchy of Sri Lanka Cricket. The duty of the cricketers is to play the game and not to get involved in administration.
The national team has several talented youngsters and I'm happy that skipper Angelo Mathews is showing maturity as a captain. He is able to take decisions on his own on the field, he said.
Speaking further Minister Ranatunga said that Sri Lanka has to prepare for the World Twenty20 next year and the Cricket World Cup.
Sri Lanka needs administrators with a vision to help the country to produce a World Cup winning team. I'm willing to help Sri Lanka cricket with my knowledge in developing school cricket which could help to produce talented cricketers who will go onto represent the country, Ranatunga said.

Art for art's sake!
Seven artists came together bound to each other by their love of art and sculpture aided by the Lionel Wendt. Their artistic creations are testimony to their talent and their perseverance. Coming from various walks of life they have such passion for art!
Each year in November the Lionel Wendt holds what they call the 'Festival of Art' where they give the gallery free for a collective exhibition of Art and Sculpture. Here they feature art exhibitions for groups of artists who cannot have an exhibition by themselves. The whole aim is to promote art. Here the gallery and theatre is given free. These young artists can have the gallery to themselves for five days.
These young artists really cannot afford to have a permanent exhibition in Colombo elsewhere except on the road. Lionel Wendt Art center is there to promote art and theatre in Sri Lanka. They want to help these artists.
"We are there to promote art and we do not take any commissions from anyone. When they sell all their money is for them," said Lionel Wendt Memorial Fund, Administrative Secretary, Dilrukshi Rambukwelle. These fine young artists are namely - Dileepa, Chammika, Kusal, Sajeewani, Teklan, Chandana and Morayas
"Normally a set up like this would cost around Rs. 18,000. But the Lionel Wendt is giving it to us for free. The Lionel Wendt wants to promote art in Sri Lanka and the artists here are those who have passed out from the University of Aesthetic studies and Vibhavi Academy. The artists here have academic knowledge of this vocation. They are full time artists. However all the artists here differ in their style and subject matter. In this exhibition four of us feature works of art and two of us feature sculpture," said Chammika Jayawardana.
Chammika feels that there is a certain threat when it comes to this industry. At a very young age boys and girls are told that their drawings are ugly. After that the child becomes disillusioned and gives up drawing pictures and gives up practicing."If you take my works they are small but capture minute details. It is all about precision and hard work. The picture I draw reflects my mood and my sense of color. In all our pictures there is a certain European influence. All of us have been trained in sculpture as well even though only Chandana and Morayas feature sculptures in this exhibition. The rest of us feature all paintings. Here in this exhibition what is featured is what the individual likes best.""If you take my works they are small but capture minute details. It is all about precision and hard work.

All of us have been trained in sculpture as well even though only Chandana and Morayas feature sculptures in this exhibition. The rest of us feature all paintings. Here in this exhibition what is featured is what the individual likes best."Chammika's creations are subtle, Kusal wants to start a discourse about capital punishment through his works, Sajeewani's works are about the feminine and the female's perception of herself and her image of herself, Dileepa works are about the nude, Chandana works center upon the animal, Teklan is abstract. Morayas is assembled art something similar to Picasso.
"Before writing the child learns to draw. The child's perception of the world is destroyed from the very beginning. His/her sense of originality and his/her world is pruned. This hinders the child's development. Art is thinking and the child becomes just another product of society. Also another danger is, upcoming young artists have no space to display their pictures."
Chammika feels that it is the flaw in Sri Lankan society that only when someone dies is his/her paintings appreciated in Sri Lanka. Vincent Van Gogh though not Sri Lankan was one example in his day and age in his society.
"Art changes when society and culture changes. Art contains the history of a nation. When thoughts change that is art. Van Gogh was fearless in his artistic expressions. He drew for his own pleasure. It took some time for people to understand his pictures. Leonardo Da Vinci was also one who dedicated his efforts to art and made sacrifices."

Beeralu charm
Placing her Beeralu Kottaya (Lace Maker's Pillow) made of soft wood, stored on a larger surface padded with coir, on a table and seating on a low bench Gnanawati is holding up a pair of bobbins in her hand as she carefully places a pin in the pillow. She makes her bobbin lace.
At the top of the pillow there are some pins to secure the lace as it is woven. Many threads spread out from the pins, each thread fastened to one of the bobbins spread across the pillow.
Her fingers fly and the bobbins click like wind chimes as she flings them this way and that, twiddling, crossing, cording, pausing often to take one of the pins from the back of the collection and set it in a new place between the stitches she has just woven. The collection of lace products includes bookmarks, wall hangings, blouses, table cloths, cushion covers, pillow cases proving the versatility of her skills.
The process looks complex but when she works at the lace pillow she does not concentrate completely on her task. Recalling the lace-making history of her life while weaving a lace, K.A Gnanawathi Abeysiriwardane, lady lacemaker from Kithulampitiya said she learnt lace-weaving from her Loku Amma at the age of twelve. She refers to those days as the good old times when lace was popular among rich upper-class women.
"Lace-making is not hard to learn and that almost anyone can do it. Those days I sold most of my lace to 'Reinda Ammala' in Magalla and made a good living. They regularly visited our homes and purchased our products." She said.
"But today we do not receive a good price for our products as the mediators who purchase our products only pay Rs.20-25 per a yard of a lace. By spending nearly a day to wave a yard of lace, we can only get Rs.20-25. So today I am not doing this as a business. I just weave lace for my pleasure since I love this art. I really enjoy it. Weaving lace is really a meditation. I am willing to train young lace-makers without letting this art to fade away," she said.
However, for Gnanawathi the good times seemed to changed quickly. She is 72 years old today. She is weak and her eyesight is failing. The lace she produces is not as neat as it used to be. She can no longer use her skills to support herself. Without being able to make good quality lace she has no buyers and therefore no income.
Not only Gnanawathi, but most lace-makers in their old age who produced masterpieces in their glory days are left helpless. If there are training facilities where the younger generations can learn the craft and experienced lace-makers can share and improve their skills.
W I I Kumari, an award winning master lace-maker from Thilakapura, Ambalangoda, said that there is a huge demand for lace products among the foreigners. But local people do not buy our products as these products are little bit expensive. Normally we sell a hand lace blouse at Rs.3000-4000. But there are imported blouses woven by machines in the local market at a low price. So we do our products aiming at the foreigners.
Lace-making is a very delicate and difficult craft. Before weaving the lace the lace-makers need to prepare a stencil. To create a stencil the lace-maker needs to know all the different types of knots used in lace-making.
The stencil is made on a piece of card-board using graph paper. They then trace the pattern of the lace onto a piece of paper and fix the pattern onto the rotatable structure of the beeralu kotte or pillow, the wooden structure used to make lace, and create their lace weaving over 30 wooden bobbins or beeralu. They create their pattern using pins where necessary in the design to separate the different kinds of knots. The craft is so intricate and difficult that it takes an experienced lace maker about a week to create a metre of one inch wide lace," she said.
Kumari has won a number of awards and certificates including Silver Award at the Shilpa exhibition organized by the National Crafts Council. Currently she works as a training instructor at Vidatha training centre, Ambalangoda. She also trains schoolchildren.
Beeralu lace making has long been considered a traditional craft of Sri Lanka. Today a small concentration of women still continues this craft mainly in Galle and Matara. It is an art form in crisis. They fight old age, poor market conditions and poverty to keep the craft going.
D M Chithra Kanthi, one of the lace makers, specializes in bobbin lace started learning how to make lace from the age of 10, as there were lace makers in her family. Over the years, the shape and colour of the mats she makes have changed to meet modern tastes. Previously, lace was nearly always white, but now there is demand for other colours.

CIA chief expects more IS attacks in pipeline
US: CIA director John Brennan warned Monday that the attacks in Paris were likely not a one off event and that he expects the Islamic State group has more operations in the pipeline.
Security and intelligence services right now are working feverishly to see what else they can do in terms of uncovering it, he said at a Washington think tank.
The CIA chief said Friday night's attacks by gunmen in suicide vests in the heart of the French capital were carefully planned and executed.
This was not something done in a matter of days. This is something that was carefully and deliberately planned over the course of several months in terms of whether they had the operatives, the weapons, explosives, suicide belts.
I would anticipate that this is not the only operation ISIL has in the pipeline, he said, using an alternate acronym for IS, the militant group that has seized large areas of Syria and Iraq.
At least 129 people were killed in the attacks carried out by at least eight gunmen nearly simultaneously at a stadium, a concert hall and restaurants as throngs of Parisians were enjoying a night out.
The attacks were the latest in a burst of horrific attacks attributed to IS -- following the apparent bombing October 31 of a Russian airliner over the Sinai with 224 people aboard and twin suicide bombings that killed 44 people in Beirut on Thursday.
They are looking abroad to have these spectacular attacks to further their narrative that the caliphate is growing and is successful, Brennan said.
Intelligence services were aware that IS was planning attacks outside their strongholds in Iraq and Syria, particularly targeting Europe, Brennan said.
I can tell you it was not a surprise that this attack was carried out, from a standpoint that we did have strategic warning, we knew plans, plotting by ISIL was underway, looking particularly at Europe as a venue for carrying out these attacks, he said.
But the large numbers of individuals who have gone to Syria and Iraq and then returned to Europe, he said, has strained the capacity of European intelligence services to monitor them all.

Conspiracy to sling mud at UNP using Avant Garde - Harin
There is a conspiracy to sling mud at the UNP using the Avant Garde issue, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said.
He said the UNP never wants to close the chapter on Avant Garde or defend it. "This is why the Prime Minister is seeking a full scale inquiry on the Avant Garde issue," Fernando said.
The minister was addressing the media yesterday at the Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ministry. He said that certain politicians are making baseless allegations about several politicians including him that they have received gains from Avant Garde and added that he will never betray the UNP for monetary gain.
Minister Fernando challenged anyone for a debate on the concept of floating armouries of the world as it is not something new to maritime security.
Speaking on the resignation of Former Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana, Minister Fernando said that he (Marapana) is an exemplary figures in Sri Lankan politics.
He further said that it is clear that certain persons are slinging mud at the UNP over the Avant Garde issue.
"Avant Garde was formed during the former government. Even though, the politicians did not utter a single word against Avant Guard when the agreement was signed during the last regime, they are now making a big noise against Avant Garde," he said.
He noted that there are over 6,500 employees at Avant Garde and therefore their job security should be assured.
"What I am asking is to convert Avant Garde as an income generating venture for the country while securing these 6,500 employments," he said.

Deepika goes solo
Soulful songstress Visharada Deepika Priyadarshani Peiris is ready to mesmerize Sri Lankan audiences with her Solo Musical Concert 'Kaviya Obe'. In a career spanning more than three decades, she has regaled local music lovers with an intensity and feeling that comes from the bottom of her heart. A lady who feels for others, she is driven by a need to create change for the greater good of all.
"We live in an age where people are not able to enjoy songs because of their busy lifestyles. Nevertheless there is an interest and demand, because people still like to enjoy these songs.
That is why many people have requested me to do a concert like this. I also have an onus to take my songs and my love of songs not only to Colombo audiences but to the rural community as well. If you take Colombo audiences, they have easy access to halls and theaters. I want to go into this rural sphere and create a discourse about these songs and enable the rural folk to enjoy these songs. In this concert of mine, some of my very popular songs will be sung," said Deepika.
Deepika has been fortunate to have had the opportunities that she has had in life. Feeling extremely privileged to be leading the life she is leading, she is also thankful for having the privilege of associating with so many people in the industry who have influenced her and formed her.
"Here I want to remember my fans with affection and warmth. If I can use my songs for the betterment of society, to the best of my abilities, then I can consider that a worthy accomplishment."
Deepika is concerned about her motherland. She is concerned about the future of the people of our society. "With my popularity if I can point and guide children down the correct path, that is something I place great value on."
It seems Deepika's is a crusade to promote not only the tradition of Sri Lankan music but also values that go hand in hand with it. As a society she feels that we must aim for something. Aim to do something good with the passion of song in mind. She feels that should be done for those in our country who truly love our song tradition, even those who may not be able to go to the BMICH.
"With the best of my ability I want to safeguard and preserve this tradition of song, this heritage. That is my fervent wish and expectation.
The previous generations did not have this problem. Today reviving our song culture will take some effort. It may be a long journey but we must take the first step."
In an age where young Sri Lankans run after Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift this concert by Deepika will be a refreshing experience and opportunity to enjoy Sri Lanka music.

[Stars of Yesteryear]
Edna Sugathapala: Scripting humility into life
She is known for her acting, particularly during a time when film as is known here and today bloomed throughout two decades. She has her associations, her acquaintances, those she met and befriended on and off the set. To limit her to cinema however, would be doing her an injustice, something she implies early on in the interview. Yes, you saw her paired in film after film with some of the "top stars" of our cinema. Yes, they all won her praise and unruffled success.
But Edna Sugathapala is not just an actress. One doubts whether she wants to or can be pigeonholed into that profession alone. For that matter, one doubts whether she CAN be pigeonholed into ANY profession at all. She has done what she has done with utmost sincerity. No pigeonholing possible there.
She can play the piano and play it well, for one thing. She has mastered three other instruments as well. She has released a CD and DVD chronicling her love for the piano, and states unequivocally that she doesn't want to stop it at that. As she delves into her biography, full of interesting anecdotes but never obese on frill, she makes one thing clear: she hasn't stopped at anything at any point in her life.
Edna was born in 1946. She was educated at Good Shepherd Convent in her hometown Panadura, and later at Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya. She describes herself during all her school years as "studious and quite prone towards book", which set her apart from her friends and in the end which worked its charm on her mother. Music, it seems, had fascinated her a lot, and so at the age of six her mother had not only bought her a piano, but through it got her to take (and pass) the Higher Local Exam. "Back then it was foreigners who came and judged for that exam," she remembers, "I remember the comment they made on my recital: 'brilliant touch'."
The piano didn't stop intensifying her love for music, by the way. While at the church choir she learnt to master the organ, while elsewhere she got to handle the accordion and guitar. Nor did this stop her from pursuing her other interests: she loved dressmaking, for one thing, and in the end enrolled in the Kathleen School of Dressmaking in her hometown.
She had learnt to value time and efficiency. With more than one interest to pursue and being musically inclined, she never forgot to finetune her skills, often waking up at three in the morning to practise before heading to school. Her mother, whom she recalls fondly, was a strict woman, "and more pertinently a strict Catholic woman", who while never severe on young Edna had nonetheless had her way with her obedient, studious daughter.
Inadvertently however, she had got involved with a field of work the mother had learnt to scorn. This was astrology. The mother being a devout Catholic had despised the looking up of horoscopes, but through an uncle had been persuaded to look up her own via a prominent astrologer in Nugegoda. The astrologer, Daniel Gamariya gurunnanse, was known throughout the country then. Sceptically, she had paid him a visit with Edna.
The daughter explains what happened next. "My mother was quite the critic. She stopped the gurunnanse when he was reciting her horoscope. She told him that his interpretation was wrong. He did not stop. He asked as to when she was born and questioned whether the clock which recorded that time was pitch-perfect. 'Maybe not,' she confessed. The astrologer then changed her planet from Mercury to Venus, and began revising her horoscope. Lo and behold, he converted my mother and with her me that day by reading almost every portion of her life correctly and to the point. 'Now am I wrong, madam' was his parting shot at her. 'No,' she stammered."
Along the way back to Panadura, young Edna had openly professed an interest in astrology. The mother, knowing how studious the daughter was ("I was always first in class," she recounts now, with justifiable pride) let her have her way for once, and took her to another astrologer, H. H. Premaratne gurunnanse. The gurunnanse had initially been wary of teaching Edna, complaining that "girls from prim, proper Colombo schools cannot be taught the art of reading the future". Thanks to her mother's overtures however, in the end he relaxed his position and offered to impart to Edna the proverbial secrets of his trade. She was 13 at the time.
More than 50 years on, she still reads horoscopes, predicts the future, and publishes some of her "anavaki" in various newspapers. As she browses through old newspaper clippings she herself comes across some of the more profound ones: to do with presidential elections and deaths of famous stars. She in fact predicted GaminiFonseka's death two years before it happened, December 2002 to be specific. There are of course other predictions too numerous to mention here, but suffice it to say that they all have come true in one form or another.
So in this context how did she take to films Again, through her mother. She had been a film producer, and had financed Daskon, an expensive historical epic. She was about 12 at the time when she saw Daskon, "a financial failure and one which left my mother with a loss" as she recalls now. It was her first encounter with the Sinhala cinema, as well as with two people she'd meet again and again in the career to come, Rukmani Devi and Fonseka himself.
For her entry into cinema though, she had to go through the theatre (metaphorically speaking). She was trained and tutored by the famous theatre producer Dick Dias. The year was 1966 when she got to act in her first play ("GehenuHatana"). 10 years earlier he had initiated JeevaraniKurukulasuriya ("MaaHenaeRiriYaka") into acting, and 10 years before that he had done the same for Rukmani ("JanakiHaranaya"). When asked whether this was a prophetic sign, she laughs and lays out Dias' credentials.
"He was a kind man. Not just a theatre producer but one who knew his field well. He was originally an engineer, he began financing these plays, and in the end managed to introduce some of his more incisive actors and actresses into both the stage and cinema. In fact it was Dias who financed the first production of "SiriSangabo", which was a landmark by all accounts thanks to its final, memorable scene of the altruistic king beheading himself in front of the audience. So yes, I am indebted to him today."
Her initiation into cinema, however, was tougher. Not only had there been calls to get her off-screen, people visibly began commenting on how she was fat, was not photogenic enough, and even didn't augur well for films. Again, it had been an acquaintance of hers who had come to her rescue. "When Das Mohammad thought of auditioning me for SurayangethSuraya, GaminiFonseka advised him to take me if I read my lines properly. Remember, Daskon may have been a failure, but Fonseka was popular at the time and it was his first film after Daiwayogaya. He knew my mother had suffered a loss because of that film."
She was taken for SurayangethSuraya, needless to say. In later years she hobnobbed and got to act with the "stars" so to speak. She rattles off a list here: Joe Abeywickrema, Tony Ranasinghe, Freddie Silva, Denawaka Hamine, Sandya Kumari.

Reconciliation, democracy and international re-engagement
EU foreign ministers welcome SL's progress
The European Union (EU) Foreign Affairs Council yesterday welcomed the significant advances made by the country to restore democratic governance, initiate a process of national reconciliation and re-engage with the international community and the UN system.
The EU Foreign Affairs Council welcomed these advances in their first discussions on Sri Lanka in more than six years.
The Council concluded that there are new opportunities for the EU to engage with the Sri Lankan government in making further progress in areas, including reconciliation, strengthening good governance and tackling corruption, promoting respect for human rights and the rule of law, and fostering inclusive economic growth and sustainable development.
The Council also welcomed the resolution adopted at the 30th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, but noted that continued political leadership would be needed from all sides to address the underlying causes of the conflict and to deal with the past in a way that established a lasting foundation for a peaceful future.
The EU lauded the steps taken to strengthen civilian administration in the North and East and called on the government to move swiftly to build the confidence of communities, including releasing the identity of detainees and accelerating their prosecution or release, repealing the PTA, calibrating military presence according to identified security needs and returning land sequestered by the military to its rightful owners.
Foreign Ministers commended the steps taken by Sri Lanka to comply with EU rules on fishing. They encouraged shortcomings to be addressed, so that the ban on fish exports could be lifted as soon as possible.
The Council also positively noted recent progress in implementing the core international human rights, labour and environmental conventions and encouraged Sri Lanka to undertake the remaining necessary preparatory work to enable an application at the appropriate time for GSP+.

Every third Sunday of November to be Road Accident Victims Day
Steps would be taken to provide more dividends, including enhanced compensation and other relief to accident victims in consultation with Insurance Companies, said Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
He gave this assurance at a ceremony to mark road accident victims day held at the Colombo new Town Hall recently. The third Sunday of November each year has been designated Road Accident Victims Day by the UNO under an agreement made on October 26, 2005.
Minister de Silva said as Sri Lanka is progressing towards development status, peoples needs too has been ever increasing. Those who used a bicycle have now changed over to a motorcycle, while motor cyclists have systematically changed over to a motor car and presently the hybrid vehicle.
A large number of middle class people wished to travel by car rather than public transport, since it was a matter of prestige.
"When the number of vehicles increase in this manner, roads also have to be developed to cater to them. When roads are developed, more problems, coupled with more road accidents occur.
This was the nature of development and progress. As such, the National Council for Road Safety should take note of these facts and come up with more timely and pragmatic methods to tackle these problems.
Road accidents have become a menace throughout the world today," Minister de Silva said.
Minister de Silva said he wished to put forward certain recommendations to tackle this problem. One was to remove all old and outdated vehicles from roads.

Fitch assigns Mercantile Investments BBB-(lka)rating
Fitch Ratings Lanka has assigned Mercantile Investments and Finance (MIF) a National Long-Term Rating of BBB-(lka)'. The outlook is stable. The agency has also assigned the company's outstanding senior unsecured debentures a National Long-Term Rating of BBB-(lka)'.MIF's rating reflects its modest franchise stemming from its long operating history, satisfactory capitalisation and loan-book exposure to less risky customer segments relative to peers. However, its ratings also capture its high risk appetite, which is evident in its substantial exposure to equity investments, low profitability metrics relative to peers and greater reliance on concentrated and short-term funding.
Equity investments accounted for 16.8% of total assets at the end of the financial year to March 2015 (FYE15), much higher than the level at similarly rated peers, leaving the company vulnerable to market risk. In addition, MIF is in breach of the regulator's rule that limits equity investments to 25% of capital funds for non-bank financial institutions, with equity investments at 52.2% of capital funds at FYE15.
MIF's ROA has declined to 1.9% at end-1HFY16 from 3.2% at FYE13 largely due to weak net interest margin (NIM) and high impairment charges relative to peers. Fitch believes that a potential increase in operating costs due to branch expansion and an increase in credit costs could hamper operating profitability and internal capital generation.
Fitch views MIF's concentrated deposit base and high negative maturity mismatches as risks to its funding profile. Deposits are the main source of funding for MIF, but its deposit base is highly concentrated compared with similarly rated peers.
MIF's negative mismatches of assets and liabilities of less than one year are higher than that for similarly rated peers. It amounted to 47% of equity at end-October 2015, 50% at FYE15 and 65% at FYE14. Unutilised credit lines covered 52% of the negative mismatches at end-October 2015. Funding lines sourced by MIF by pledging its assets could help to reduce such mismatches.

FR against Mega Cabinet fixed for support
A Fundamental Rights petition filed by a lawyer challenging President Maithripala Sirisena's decision to increase the number of Cabinet ministers from 30 to 48 was yesterday fixed for support on March 15 next year by the Supreme Court.
This petition filed by Attorney-at-Law Aruna Laksiri has cited President Sirisena and the Attorney General as respondents. When this petition came up before Supreme Court Justices Eva Wanasundara, Upali Aberatne and Anil Goonaratne, the petitioner informed Court that he filed in Court several documents to support with the case.
However, the Attorney General appearing for the respondents had told Court that the respondents would raise preliminary objections against this petition.
The petitioner has stated that, according to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, a National Government should comprise the party that has obtained the highest number of seats and the other parties and independent groups in Parliament. The petitioner maintains that the present government could not be described as a National Government merely because a couple of parties have entered into an agreement to form a government, and, therefore, it is a gross violation of the Article 46.1 (a) of the Constitution.
The petitioner is seeking interim relief preventing the president from appointing more than 30 ministers.
Deputy Solicitor General Indika Demuni de Silva with Dr. Awanthi Perera appeared for the first and second respondents.

French police raid apartment in Paris' Saint-Denis area

Three suspects linked to Friday's deadly attacks in Paris died after French police raided two separate sites in Saint-Denis, a northern suburb of the French capital.
The suspects were shot by police, the sources said, as news agency's reported that a female suspect killed herself by detonating a vest rigged with explosives.
The identity of the casualties was not immediately released. However, French media said the target of the operation was Belgian national Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a key suspect ofFriday's attacks, in which at least 129 people were killed.
Another suspect, Salah Abdeslam, was also said to be a target in the raids.
Police said some of the suspects were holed up in an apartment in the suburb early on Wednesday.Three police officers were wounded in an initial shootout, sources told Al Jazeera.
Residents of the area in northern Paris first reported hearing bursts of gunfire at4:30am (3:30 GMT), as police exchanged fire with one or more suspects.
After a short lull in the operation, at least seven explosions were heard at 6:30 GMT, Al Jazeera's Jacky Rowland reported from the scene.
Heavily armed special police units and ambulances were gathering at the scene as a helicopter was hovering over the area,it is reported.
"Saint-Denis is a relatively poor area, housing many immigrants. It is near the area of the national stadium Stade de France, where suicide bombers claimed several lives during Friday's attacks," Rowland said.
Police were telling onlookers to clear the vicinity of the operation and blocked off a street in the area, as ambulances and fire engines lined the streets a stone's throw from the centre of Saint-Denis.
Friday night's attacks in the French capital, claimed by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), raised security concerns around the world, with an international football match called off in Germany andtwo Air France flightsfrom the United States diverted.
French President Francois Hollande on Wednesday will hold a meeting to discuss proposals to extend by three months the state of emergency declared after the worst attacks in French history.
It will then be put to vote by lawmakers on Thursday and Friday.
Bomb threat
In a sign of the nervousness gripping Europe after Friday's carnage, a football match between Germany and the Netherlands was cancelled on Tuesday and the crowd evacuated after police acted on a "serious" bomb threat.
As police stepped up the hunt for the fugitives, French and Russian jets pounded Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) targets in the group's self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa in Syria for a third consecutive day.
France and Russia have vowed merciless retaliation for the Paris attacks and last month's bombing of a Russian airliner, also claimed by ISIL, which have galvanised international resolve to destroy the group and end Syria's more than four-year civil war.
"It's necessary to establish direct contact with the French and work with them as allies," Russian President Vladimir Putin said as France prepared to send an aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean.
Hollande will meet Putin in Moscow on November 26, two days after seeing US President Barack Obama in Washington.

GMOA writes to President, PM on SLMC
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to the President, Prime Minister and to the Health Minister in connection with safeguarding integrity of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), GMOA sources said.
According to the sources, SLMC is the statutory body responsible for upholding standards of medical profession. It conducted its duties with integrity and fairness in the past. However, since the recent past there is a trend of abusing this prestigious institution to take revenge on its own members, especially office bearers of GMOA.
Recent inquiries have been initiated mainly under the clause of Professional Misconduct.
However, matters being inquired as Professional Misconduct include comments made on social media and events which took place at a trade union meeting. Above actions are protected by individuals constitutional rights to freedom of expression and right to take part in trade union activities.
Hence, inquiring them is beyond the purview of SLMC and violates constitutional rights, the sources said.
The inquiries are deliberately dragged on without a verdict for years causing professional, academic, financial and personal damage to the members.
Many complains received in connection with some council members abuse the powers vested in SLMC. As such, GMOA would be compelled to take all measures against SLMC to safeguard the rights of its members.

Bodu Bala Sena Organization's General Secretary Ven.Galagodaththe Gnanasara Thera yesterday said that the government should take prompt action to release the Army intelligence officials who have been imprisoned.
"These Army intelligence officials who have been imprisoned should be released forthwith as the government has taken measures to release those who were allegedly involved in terrorist atrocities," the Thera said.
"It is the duty of the government to release Army intelligence officials who rendered an invaluable service to the country in ending the 30 year terrorist conflict,"the Thera said.
Ven. Gnanasara Thera warned the government that Sri Lanka will have to face an ISIS attack as the incumbent government has paid less attention on intelligence service.
As predicted by us earlier, a Sri Lankan Muslim from Galewela was killed while allegedly fighting for the ISIS in Syria recently," the Thera said.
"The previous government was more concerned about national security than the present rulers," the Thera stressed.

Granting duel citizenship, a timely act - President
Granting dual citizenship to Sri Lankan expatriates is a timely decision taken by the government as the country is now set on a rapid development path and this decision will help to strengthen international relations, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He made this observation at a ceremony at Temple Trees to award dual citizenship to 2,000 expatriates yesterday.
Dual citizenship was among the key issues highlighted by Sri Lankan expatriates during my tours abroad, the President said.
The highest proportion of Sri Lankans expatriates left Sri Lanka due to political reasons and also due to the war. But now they need to come back as Sri Lanka is a peaceful country which treats all nationals equally, he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the support of Sri Lankan expatriates is very important to fulfill the governments objective in winning the international support in bringing reconciliation, attracting foreign investors and for the development of the country.
He also invited the expatriates who couldn't obtain dual citizenship to support the countrys development as a Diaspora.
With the Amendment of Act No. 45 of 1987, the granting of Dual Citizenship provisions which had been suspended by the previous regime since September 2011 was reintroduced.
The provision of dual citizenship was restored on March 28, 2015. Since 1987, dual citizenship was granted to 40,000 expatriates.
Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S.B.Nawinna, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Tourism Minister John Amaratunga, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga and Immigration and Immigration Controller M.N. Ranasinghe were present.

He cried for hours, simply because his mother rejected him
"Humans aren't as good as we should be in our capacity to empathize with feelings and thoughts of others, be they humans or other animals on Earth." Neil deGrasse Tyson
Tyson, in my opinion, has it right. We don't do nearly as good of a job of empathizing with ours, animals or humans. For animals in particular, we regard them as tools for us, things for our pleasure and use. We justify it by saying that they don't have feelings, that they don't have thoughts, and that they don't perceive the world with the clarity that we do.
One elephant calf challenges some of those assertions. When Zhuangzhuang was born, he was rejected by his mother. His keepers reacted in horror as the mother nearly stamped him to death almost immediately after he was born. They thought it was an accident at first. He was removed and his wounds treated, but when he was reintroduced, the mother attacked him again.

At home with Sri Lanka
The international film festival of Colombo or the Colombo festival has induced fresh hopes amongst the film fraternity and filmgoers alike towards betterment of local cinema. Second edition of the much awaited event concluded with a high note on November 11 in Colombo.
IFFC2015 was launched on November 6 at the Regal theatre with the screening of Cannes Golden Palm award winning film Dheepan directed by renowned French film director Jacques Audiard.
Main actress of Dheepan, Kalieaswari Srinivasan, made her presence at Regal on the day of the opening ceremony when Dheepan was screened.
Daily News had the privilege of interviewing a youthful Kalieaswari amidst her tight schedule of drama and film acting.
Excerpts of the interview.
Q. How was the red carpet event of IFFC2015 in Colombo
A. Very special indeed! I am touched by the warmth of people in Sri Lanka experienced at the festival.
Be it the organizers or the audience the reception has indeed been overwhelming that I felt at home here!
Q. How different was IFFC2015 to Cannes What are the things we have to rectify in the Colombo fest
A. It is unfair to compare them both. For a film festival that is in its second year IFFC has been organized well.
I had told the festival director and the volunteers that I am impressed by the sincerity and the attitude of the people involved in the festival and I am sure the festival would make itself a bigger name and a bigger success in the years to come.
Q. How did you feel when the shooting of Dheepan was on
A. Immersed in the process and the work! Had no time to feel anything else.
Q. You did semi-nude scenes in Dheepan Your comment
A. When you choose to ask about my comments on my scenes at the Mullivaikkaal refugee camp at the ferry escape point when I as Yalini bursts her heart out crying and more as such I may choose to comment on these scenes too.
Q. What attire do you like to wear most You looked elegant in Saree
A. I love to be and feel comfortable in whatever I wear! That could be Jeans, trousers, skirts or sarees. It depends on my mood and the occasion. I wore my favourite saree at the Cannes festival.
Q. How do you define Acting
A. I honestly do not know how anyone defines acting. It is in my view a different process for different people. This is my philosophy in acting.
Q. Have you seen Sri Lankan films What do you think of Sri Lankan actors
A. The only Sri Lankan film I have seen and am lucky to have seen it is With you or Without You by Prasanna Vithanage. Needless to say I loved everything about the film. Sri Lankan actors whomever I met here at the festival though I haven't seen their movies come across as genuine and warm people. I am sure they do great work in their country and they have great potential.
Q. To what extent is a film-script important in making a film
A. As an actor I feel it is more than necessary to have the full script in hand weeks before the shoot to have enough time to create and evolve the character and also to understand the story in its totality.
Q. What do you think of Dheepan director compared to Indian film directors
A. I have only worked with Jacques completely on a single project at the moment.
That has been exhilarating and a huge learning experience for me.
Q. What will be your future projects
A. I am at present working on a play titled Land of ashes and diamonds which is about the Second World War and the Sri Lankan civil war.
Also working on a movie with a Tamil director Arun Karthick where Shobashakti and I would be getting back together again.
Q. Do you aspire to hit Hollywood
A. To me working in an interesting and challenging project is the most important thing.
Be it theatre or movies, be it a Kollywood, Bollywood, Hollywood, European or a Sri Lankan project.

Implementation of Geneva Resolution must be opposed - Dr. Amarasekara
The Common opposition and the entire country should oppose the implementation of the Geneva Resolution and also the MPs taking part in the so called All Party Conference. English newspapers in Sri Lanka reveal what is going on in the country when it comes to TNA MPs activities, but vernacular newspapers avoid informing such news to the public, Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekara said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said that the Government should not hold an All Party Conference now, as the show was now over.
The Government should have done it before bringing in the Geneva Resolution. What the Government should do now is to reveal as to how the resolution would be implemented in Sri Lanka. But the Government is not doing so, but lead the public astray, by publicising other shows such as Avant Garde, diabetics, corruption, fight against drugs, etc. Dr. Amarasekara said that one third of the country was disabled due to the hartal organized by the TNA and it is not a single event or something done instantly. The TNA planned it in 2010 and announced it in the same year.
They showed that they were above the law of the country. They are heading towards active terrorism through Ahinsa. One TNA MP toured Australia in order to discuss Australias participation in domestic mechanism. How did it become a domestic mechanism when foreign judges take part in it, he questioned.
Ven. Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera said that although the Sri Lankan Prime Minister always rejected the claims made by media, etc., on holding discussions on the CEPA Agreement with India, the Indian authorities, especially Indias Transport Minister admitted the fact. India is fully funding the bridge to be built between Mannar and Dhanuskody.
This is because of the advantages India would get through this bridge. India has already applied for 5.2 billion US$ loan from the Asian Development Bank for this project. The feasibility study had already been done. This is not due to Indias love for Sri Lanka. China sacrificed many lives to build the Great Wall to protect the country, but here in Sri Lanka, Sri Lankans betray their own motherland.
Ven. Thera said that Sri Lanka would be destroyed if the bridge was built between Mannar and Dhanuskody. Sri Lanka would lose its natural protection, the sea. Unemployed Indians would flood in Sri Lanka and do odd jobs for food and other benefits.
At the moment, a Sri Lankan labourer charges Rs.1,000 per day. They would turn into Sri Lankans by obtaining the relevant legal documents easily, as their complexion and language is similar to Sri Lankan Tamils. Indian professionals would also flood in Sri Lanka seeking employment opportunities. It would leave all Sri Lankan professionals jobless. LTTE tigers are children of our motherland, but they should be punished for the crimes committed and they should be rehabilitated.

Islamic States apocalypse is propaganda, not military strategy
FRANCE: Islamic State is soaked in an apocalyptic vision in which its self-styled caliphate is merely staging point for the ultimate destination, a battle between Muslims and the army of infidels.
Foreshadowed in the sayings of the Prophet Mohammed and appropriated by Islamic State propagandists, the prophecy predicts the final conflict will take place in the northern Syrian towns of Dabiq or Al-Amaq.
Total victory for the forces of Islam will be accompanied by the return of the messiah  Jesus Christ, the 12th imam Mahdi, or both, depending on the version  and the end of the suffering of Muslims.
So enamoured are the cadres of the barbaric terrorist group with the armageddon augury, they beheaded Western journalists and aid workers in Dabiq. In videos of the decapitations, IS fighters dared the armed forces of the West to meet them there and face inevitable destruction.
IS named its English language propaganda magazine after the town. It frequently quotes the deceased founder of al Qaeda in Iraq, the precursor of IS, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, forecasting that the spark lit by the group in Iraq will intensify until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq.
As France declares a merciless war on Islamic State and world leaders ponder more aggressive military action, it leaves open the question: was the slaughter of civilians in Paris designed to enrage and provoke the West into a full-scale invasion The answer is no. At least, not yet.
To be sure, after the painful experience of US-led forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, the idea that the West can again be goaded into a long, bloody ground war has appeal for the militant group.
But the evidence suggests something different is afoot.
Rather than encourage an invasion, the attack on Paris, the claimed downing of a Russian passenger jet and suicide bombings in Beirut and Ankara are designed instead to dissuade France, the US and its allies from their bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria.In its statement claiming responsibility for the Paris atrocity, IS warns the smell of death will never leave their noses as long as they lead the convoy of the Crusader campaign, [while they are] striking the Muslims in land of the caliphate with their planes.
In other words, this is retribution. There is a terrible price to pay for attempting to destroy the caliphate.
The IS attacks, many have noted, coincide with the caliphate suffering a series of small but significant military reversals in recent weeks.

James Bond has taken me to incredible places: Daniel Craig
INDIA: Daniel Craig may have fuelled speculation about the possibility of not returning as James Bond but the actor says embodying the popular character in four movies has taken him to great places.
Craig, who is credited for introducing a more physical and vulnerable aspect to the 007 agent, had recently kicked up headlines by saying that he has had enough of the character.
However, in a chat with journalists while promoting the movie in Cancun, Mexico this June, the 47-year-old actor seemed nostalgic about his journey from "Casino Royale" to the latest "Spectre".
"I genuinely try not to think about it at all (playing Bond), just so I can live as normal a life as possible... but it's been extraordinary and it's taken me to places, most incredible places that I never would have gone to, and met and worked with brilliant people and still am," Craig said.
The actor is happy to collaborate with director Sam Mendes again on "Spectre" after they worked on "Skyfall".
"When I started shooting these movies, it was a huge eye-opener for me. I'd never been involved with anything and I'm in a very good place. I'm working with a friend who's come back and done the next movie and that makes me very happy."
Craig has romanced some of the most beautiful women as Bond and is happy to work with Italian star Monica Bellucci.
"We've been blessed with an amazing cast and Monica is part of that and she's an extraordinary actress. She's wonderful to work with. She's incredibly kind and generous and we're just very, very lucky to have her."
He has suffered many injuries while working on the action sequences of these movies, latest being a knee injury during the shooting of "Spectre" that reportedly halted the production for some time. Craig said their endeavor has always been to rely on real action over CGI.
"We just have to be better than everybody else... We try and do everything for real. And where we can't we're very sparing of CGI."
"Spectre", the 24th James Bond film, produced by Albert R Broccoli's EON Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, and Sony Pictures Entertainment, is set for release in India this Friday in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu.
Oscar winner Christoph Waltz, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Lea Seydoux, Monica Bellucci, Dave Bautista and Andrew Scott also star in the movie.
Meanwhile, according to most critics, Spectre" is not the typical film about the ber-super-famous James Bond. Instead, Sam Mendes' second Bond cinematographic product resembles a TV show season finale as it wraps up all the subtle and sometimes not so visible dots that connect "Casino Royale," "Quantum of Solace" and "Skyfall"-the other three films in which Daniel Craig plays the titular spy. The bad guy, who was the boss of all the previous bad guys, is punished, but is he completely out of the picture or will he come back in the next movie The good guy who has been single for a while falls in love, but will it be definite love and will it last Just like a solid season finale, the ending scene of "Spectre" leaves several questions open and unanswered.
After travelling around the world destroying private property and seducing women in Mexico, Italy and Austria-what else does he ever do anyway-Bond eventually discovers that Franz Oberhauser (Christopher Waltz), is the source of all his woes. Oberhauser's real name is Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion) who is related to the deaths of Bond's dearest people-his parents, former boss M, Vesper Lynd and, if one goes back to "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" (1969), his wife Tracy Bond ne di Vicenzo. Bond's archenemy has planned to control the world through omnipresent security surveillance but England's favorite spy will look to stop him.
One of these questions is precisely whether Bond has finally fallen in love again. Unfortunately, the emergence of love between the spy and the daughter of one of his previous enemies seems abrupt and reinforces gender stereotypes of a weak lady falling for the macho man who is protecting her from the evil. Mendes said that Madeleine Swann-a radiant La Seydoux-was a complex and an empowered female character, which is fair but not totally convincing.
An appealing aspect of the movie is the opening scene. The representation of the role of exotic places in the global politics has added layers of complexity to each movie from the very first James Bond film, despite (or shall I say, precisely because of) their colonialism. Just "Dr. No" (1962) portrays the role of the Caribbean in the Cold War, or as "Die Another Day" (2002) displays the political anxiety of the English-speaking world about the rise of North Korea, the opening scene of "Spectre"-the celebration of Da de los Muertos in Mexico, depicted through one of the most aesthetic and successful long shots in the history of the Bond movies-could be seen as a commentary on the growing influence of Latin America and its people in the international economy.
Now the real question is, will Madeline Swann have the same destiny as Tracy Bond did Don't be surprised if Blofeld returns in the 25th Bond movie and murders Swann. If this happened, would it not that be the perfect excuse to make 007 seek revenge and then retire, handing over the Bond baton to another actor in grand style As Christoph Waltz shined as a cold-blooded psychopath but only had an active role from the second part of the movie on, he would hopefully be part of that hypothetical scenario. We will see.

From jeered to feared, 'MJ' unpredictable to the end
PERTH,| Tuesday: Mitchell Johnson was a figure of fun before he became the most feared cricketer on the planet, in a roller coaster of a career that remained unpredictable to the end.
The strapping fast bowler with the handlebar moustache was the butt of relentless teasing by English fans before he hit back in stunning style in the 2013-2014 Ashes.
If his frightening form in that series, which traumatised English batsman and inspired a 5-0 win, was unexpected, so was his sudden departure from the Test scene.
Johnson, 34, had signalled retirement was in his thoughts but his eventual announcement, on the last day of the second Test against New Zealand with one game to go, came as a surprise.
Australia are 1-0 up in the three-match series and the final game will be historic -- the first ever day-night Test, starting next week in Adelaide.
Johnson has also retired from all forms of international cricket, rather than stepping away from Tests first and then limited-overs, as is often the protocol. "I've given the decision a lot of thought," said Johnson. "Beyond this match, I'm just not sure that I can continue competing consistently at the level required to wear the baggy green."
The raw kid from outback Queensland was identified as a star in the making as early as his teens by Dennis Lillee, who called him a "once in a lifetime" talent.
A series of back stress fractures almost ended his career before it started, and he famously drove a plumbing van after losing his Queensland contract before he came good and made his Test debut in 2007, aged 26.
Johnson announced himself on December 18, 2008, in a fiery performance against South Africa in Perth, taking seven wickets for only 12 runs -- including 5-2 near the close.
'MJ' was also devastating against South Africa in Durban in 2009 but he had a forgettable Ashes series later that year, finishing with 200-3 at Lord's. - 'Ups and downs' -Johnson's unorthodox technique and sheer pace could make his bowling a lottery, inspiring the taunting chant of "He bowls to the left, he bowls to the right" as Australia crashed at home in the 2010-2011 Ashes.
But on his day, he was unplayable -- as at Perth in 2010, when his 6-38 against England inspired Australia's only win of the series.
Off-field stability was also hard to find, with widespread reports of a rift between Johnson's mother and his wife-to-be, former model and karate black belt Jessica Bratich, early in his Test career.
A broken toe in 2011 gave him vital time to reflect but it wasn't until he returned to the Test squad, after an eight-month absence, for the 2013-2014 Ashes that Johnson's true potential was fulfilled. Wearing a Lillee-style moustache, he tore through a quivering England line-up at Brisbane's Gabba ground, taking nine wickets as the tourists collapsed.
"Lunch No thanks. I was sitting there, thinking: I could die here in the fucking Gabbattoir," England's Kevin Pietersen later wrote in his autobiography.
Johnson didn't stop there and he finished with 37 wickets and was named man of the series as Australia crushed their old enemy 5-0.
In South Africa later in 2014, Johnson took 22 wickets in three Tests -- breaking Ryan McLaren's arm on the way to taking 12 wickets in the first Test at Centurion. - AFP

Johnson takes final two wickets in drawn Test
Perth, Tuesday: Retiring Australian fast bowler Mitchell Johnson claimed the last two wickets as the second Test against New Zealand ended in a draw at the WACA Ground in Perth on Tuesday.
The home side declared at 385 for seven after lunch, leaving the Kiwis needing an unlikely 321 to win from 48 overs to level the series, at almost seven runs per over. A shower delayed play for about an hour and the Kiwis showed little appetite for the chase when they resumed in a match dominated by the bat on a lifeless pitch.
When stumps was called early with 20 overs left, the Kiwis were 104 for two, with Ross Taylor on 36 and Kane Williamson on 32.
Having won the first Test by 208 run at the Gabba, the result means Australia have retained the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy.
Australian captain Steve Smith said he would have liked to set a more attacking target for the Kiwis, but their good bowling on the final morning had put paid to that ambition.
"It would have been nice to have set about 360 off 65-70 overs," he said. "I thought they bowled really well again this morning so it was tough to get that far ahead in the game.
"The wicket was still really good and I didn't want to give them too much of a sniff."
Kiwi captain Brendon McCullum said the target was a "bridge too far" for his side.
After Kane and Rosss innings it would have felt pretty hollow to come out with at least a draw in this match," he said.
The wicket was good, but there was still an element of vulnerability with those cracks especially if our lower order was exposed.

Joint Opposition will not participate in APC if it does not address countrys issues - Wimal
National Freedom Front Leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa said that members of the Joint Opposition will not participate in the All Party Conference (APC) if it does not address the issues faced by the country.
He said the Joint Opposition will participate in the APC if it has goals acceptable to all.
MP Weerawansa was participating in a media-briefing held in Colombo yesterday
The government is facing a crisis today because several ministers are accusing each others on various matters. There has been a drastic increase in the prices of essential items in an unprecedented manner, he said
The burden of the cost of living has greatly affected the ordinary people, he said.
The people caste their vote for change at the January 8 Presidential election and January 17 General elections respectively.But, the people have already felt the change due to skyrocketing of the prices of essential commodities. They will further realize
the real change with the presentation of the budget on November 20, Weerawansa said.
The joint Opposition plans to take a serious measures in due course to counter this trend, he said.
Mahajana Eksath Peramuna leader and Colombo District UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena said the Geneva resolution is a clear agreement to hunt down members of the Security Forces, who defeated terrorism and also to revive terrorism.
The governments agreement contravenes with the Sri Lankan Constitution. European Union countries can act against Sri Lanka through this agreement. But, the Foreign Minister has already signed it. According to the Geneva agreement, there is a tendency to revise certain judicial verdicts given in the past. The TNA is also acting above and beyond the verdicts of Sri Lankan Courts, he said.
UPFA MP Prof. G.L. Peris said the government has commenced a programme to release LTTE suspects detained under the PTA.Under the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, over 12,000 LTTE ex cadres were rehabilitated.
We did not rehabilitate and release about 235 LTTE suspects who clearly did not fit the profile for rehabilitation. The Australian Foreign Minister has been requested by TNA MP Sumanthiran to include an Australian Judge in the proposed Hybrid Court, MP Peiris.
The government has also invited a powerful figure of the Global Tamil Form to Sri Lankan to discuss the matter. There is a programme to repeal the PTA and other sector laws and establish Hybrid Courts with foreign judges to take action against Security Forces members, he said.
LSSP Leader and former Minister Prof. Tissa Vitharana said that terrorism has spread its tentacles across the world and the recent attacks in France is one such example of that. But, our valiant soldiers who helped destroy one of the most brutal terrorist groups in the world is being accused of human rights violations and if this trend continues, it will spell doom for the fight against global terrorism,he said.
Although this government is described as a national government, it is an entire UNP led government. The five-year development plan presented by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently in Parliament is a repetition of the Regaining Sri Lanka programme, he unveiled in 2002, he said.
The UNP is currently implementing the wishes of imperialists. They are now following a neo-liberal and neo-colonial economic policy. There is a huge economic breakdown. But, people are being deceived . Foreign Reserves in Sri Lanka decreased to US dollars 6.2 from US dollars 8.3. They are not enough for next seven months which is the usual norm.
The budget deficit has also gone up. Promises pledged by this government were not fulfilled. We cannot allow this to continue. How are all these promises going to be fulfilled in the future In this situation, the government is trying to hoodwink the people by making various false promises. There are reports that the US is going to build a naval base in Trincomalee to broaden their military drive. We will oppose this move tooth and nail, he said.
PHU leader MP Udaya Gammanpila said that meritorious activities will be held to mark the 70th birthday of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at Anuradahapura today, and we invite all Sri Lankans to attend this occasion.
Only seven Sri Lankan Kings have unified the country previously and the former President was the eight ruler to do so. There are reports that United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Powell is coming to Sri Lanka. But this news does not appear in the US government or Sri Lankan government websites. It is a mystery as to why this visit is being undertaken so secretely, MP Gammanpila said.
We urge her to draft a report that is fair by both sides instead of drafting reports which are partial to the LTTE, he said.
Communist Party Deputy Secretary and MP Chandrasiri Gajadheera said the joint opposition urges the government to establish a Truth Commission to investigate whether it delivered the promises made during the 100 day programme.

Sri Lanka's economy is facing tough challenges and to overcome this the country should look at a FTA with USA and also similar economic partnerships with other countries, including India, Singapore and China, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Lankan superstar MALAGAMUWA looking to impress in USA
Sri Lanka's icon on the international racing track, Dilantha Malagamuwa will be looking for his first ever world title when the veteran star tests his abilities against 65 of world's best drivers at the Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo World Championship Final, which will be held at Sebring International Raceway in Florida, USA this weekend.
The Lankan, in his second attempt to book a podium finish at the Asian series, will be looking to impress over more than six dozens of world class drivers at the World Final which is considered as the most thrilling one-make series in the world. He will test the limits of his Lamborghini on November 21 and 22 with cars totaling 66 and 100 plus drivers from all over the world are expected, setting a new grid record at the end of a motorsport season.
A special media gathering had been organized by Orient Finance to wish Malagamuwa the best of luck at the world series final and Malagamuwa was over the moon about the support he gets from fans in Sri Lanka.
"I am so blessed to be born in Sri Lanka and be loved by so many people and I am treated like a King in Sri Lanka what else do I need. Now I understand the value, with greatest difficulties in my career I carried the Sri Lanka flag on my car and in return how much they respect me. I think I am one of the happiest sportsman in the world and this you cannot buy for money. I will do my best in US and will fly Sri Lanka high again", he said.
He is determined to complete this year's World Final with a podium finish after failing disastrously last year due to technical reasons.
"Last year I couldn't complete both races due to problems that popped up in the gearbox and a tyre puncture. With the race held in Malaysia on a circuit that is familiar to me, last year would have been the ideal time to have a podium finish. But unfortunately it was not my time. With the success of this season, I'm hopeful of a positive finish," he added
The World Final will take place in North America for the first time. All three Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo Series - Europe, Asia and North America - will come to Sebring, Florida, for the final rounds. Sebring is America's oldest road racing track, with more than six decades of storied history on its 17-turn, 3.74-mile circuit. It is the home to the famed Twelve Hours of Sebring.
Over the last seven months, drivers and teams have battled for championships in each Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo series and both overall driver and team championships are still up for grabs for North America and Asia heading into the final two rounds of the 2015 season at Sebring.
The Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo World Final which will be its third edition and also the final round of the three European, North American and Asian series is Malagamuwa's second after his first attempt failed in Malaysia last year.
During the event there will be four titles up for grabs besides the Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo World Final. Other races to be held are PRO, PRO-AM, AM and Gallardo AM.
Malagamuwa's team, Dilango Racing, although running on minimum recourses, are considered to be one of the best in the fray. "We know we are small fish compared to other racing teams from around the world. But this is all about skills and determination with each and every driver in contention racing on a machine that looks and performs equally.
"Getting accustomed to the track will be a matter of time and we are confident of giving others the biggest challenge and take the checked flag first," he added.

More than 10,000 on French list of potential terror suspects
FRANCE: France has listed more than 10,000 people suspected of being radicalised or potential security threats, including homegrown assailant Omar Ismail Mostefai who killed scores of people at Paris's Bataclan music on Friday.
According to police sources, the so-called fiche S (S file in French) is updated daily to include individuals suspected of links to a terrorist movement or group.
The S stands for the suspects potential to endanger the security of the state.
The list has 15 categories spanning everyone from football hooligans to battle-hardened jihadists returning from Iraq and Syria.
The suspects come into the spotlight if they are arrested or subject to a check after which they are immediately on the radar of the intelligence services.
There are more than 10,000 people who are on the fiche S list, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said over the weekend.
Some of them are already known to security forces or sentenced for acts of terror, while the others are suspected of either having been radicalised or susceptible to it. More and more cases of radicalised assailants have surfaced recently including the Al-Qaeda-linked gunman Mohammed Merah who killed seven people in and around the southern city of Toulouse in 2012.
The same was true of the attackers who targeted the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket in February this year, killing 17 people.
And Yassin Salhi, who killed and decapitated his employer in Isere in southeastern France in June had been on the S list for two years but had never come to the attention of the police. This can happen because the suspects are not automatically subject to surveillance.
It's more or less an indicator, like a thermometer that one has to monitor and feed all the time for it to be efficient, a police officer said.

A national batting crisis looms
In their long cricketing history Sri Lanka is one country that was never fallen short of quality batsmen. When you say quality it is right from the top drawer. In the pre-Test era there was starting with FC de Saram a stream of top class batters like Sargo Jayawickrama, Mahadevan Sathasivam, Mahes Rodrigo, Ivers Gunasekera, Michael Tissera and Anura Tennekoon to name a few. They were followed in the post-Test era by names such as Sidath Wettimuny, Roy Dias, Duleep Mendis, Arjuna Ranatunga, Aravinda de Silva, Sanath Jayasuriya, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara.
There was a time in the eighties after Sri Lanka had gained Test status the batting was so enriched with top quality batsmen that there was no room for any batsman playing in that era to break into the Test side. The only slot that had a weak link was for an opener to partner Sidath Wettimuny. The line up comprised Wettimuny, Ranjan Madugalle, Roy Dias, Arjuna Ranatunga, Duleep Mendis, Aravinda de Silva. Such was the talent that was available that Roshan Mahanama if he was to play for his country had to sacrifice his position as a middle order batsman which he was at school and play in the position as an opener. That Mahanama made such a wise decision saw him represent his country for 13 years and play in 52 Tests and 213 ODIs.
However the retirements of Jayawardene and Sangakkara in the past one year has suddenly exposed the paucity of quality batsmen in the national team. With the exception of captain Angelo Mathews who looks like the last of the breed, there seems to be a big void for the national selectors to fill in trying to find batsmen of class. Suddenly it seems that we have a bowling unit that can win matches for us but not a batting line up good enough to put runs on the board for the bowlers.
The problems faced by the national selectors were quite clearly defined by its chairman Kapila Wijegunawardene when he said ahead of picking the squad to New Zealand: "We had batsmen who were very good at playing fast bowling and spin bowling suddenly we are finding that most of our leading batsmen are very weak against spin. That is something for the coaches to address as a matter of priority.
"One of the reasons is perhaps the type of wickets that we've been playing and the general format of the local tournaments does not encourage batsmen to play long innings. It's a process, you need to do it and figure out how to do it on a consistent basis if our local tournaments don't encourage batsmen to occupy the crease and instill a discipline in them how to play long innings.
"In Test cricket basically its occupation of the crease and then playing the percentages, playing only the balls that you really need to play. If you occupy the crease naturally the runs are going to flow. It is a real concern which we need to address as a matter of priority."
The advent of T20 cricket has in some way affected the way build up of a cricketer to Test level. For instance whereas players like Jayawardene and Sangakkara had a solid foundation of first-class cricket before they stepped into the international fold the same cannot be said of the present generation of cricketers who sometimes make their international mark playing T20 cricket before branching into the Test arena.
Wijegunawardene agreed that a Test player has got a set of skills required to adapt to any other format but ruled out the fact that limited-over cricket had anything to do with the quality of a batsman. He said why certain modern day cricketers have started their international careers playing T20 or one-day cricket is due to the openings coming up in those formats and not for any other reason.
"In Test sides the vacancies arise infrequently compared to the other two formats. That is the reason why some of the younger players have got opportunities playing in the T20 and ODIs before they can actually be tried out in Tests," said Wijegunawardene. "Take Milinda Siriwardana he played first in ODIs not because he was not identified for Test cricket but due to the openings coming out ahead of the Tests.
"The weakness really is the tournament format that we play in our school most of the tournaments at junior level are structured on a limited-over basis that possibly limits the usage of feet and everything in a game because you are constantly looking at restricting runs and batsmen are always looking to play fancy shots and push the run rate up. That is a concern.
We need to have players learning to occupy the crease using their feet. Using the feet is one area where we really need to improve. If you are not using your feet then you are going to struggle against spin bowling that is something that we are lacking. We had batsmen in the caliber of Arjuna Ranatunga and Mahela Jayawardene who play spin with ease. We need to really work on our footwork otherwise we are going to constantly struggle against spin bowling which is not a good thing going forward because every side is now using spin against us," he said.
Wijegunawardene's observations should be taken quite seriously if Sri Lanka is to avoid a batting crisis and not fall into the pitfalls that countries like West Indies and Zimbabwe have fallen into.

Paris attacks planned from Syria, says French PM
FRANCE: The deadly attacks across Paris last week that claimed 129 lives were planned and organised from Syria, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said on Monday.
The attack was organised, conceived, and planned from Syria, CNN quoted Valls as saying in a radio interview.
The prime minister said more than 150 raids were conducted on militant targets in different areas of France earlier in the day.
We are making use of the legal framework of the state of emergency to question people who are part of the radical jihadi movement... and all those who advocate hate of the republic, he said. At least nine people have been arrested so far. Five of the detainees were identified over the weekend, and on Monday another two were named by the Paris prosecutor as Ahmad al-Mohammad and Samy Amimour, a BBC report said.
Al-Mohammad is the name on a Syrian passport found with the remains of one of the attackers, though the man's identity has not yet been verified. The other attackers so far named are all from Europe.
Amimour was said to be facing terrorism charges in France. Police sources said properties in the Paris suburb of Bobigny, as well as the cities of Grenoble, Toulouse and Lyon, had been targeted.
Seven of the attackers who carried out the Paris attacks on November 13 were killed, and at least one man suspected of involvement was at large, according to authorities.
The man at large was identified by French police as Salah Abdeslam, a 26-year-old French citizen who was born in Belgium. The French police, in a public request for information, warned that he is dangerous and not to be approached. Belgium has issued an international warrant for his arrest.

Rajitha rejects Wijayadasa's claims
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had rejected claims made by Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in connection with a judgement given by courts convicting Dr. Senaratne for importing low quality drugs to Sri Lanka, Media Secretary to the Health Minister Nipun Ekanayake said.
According to Ekanayake, Minister Rajapakshe was recently reported to have said that Dr.Senaratne had been convicted by the judiciary for importing low quality drugs to Sri Lanka. But, Dr. Senaratne rejected it. No such judgement had been given by the courts. Judge Mahanama Thilakaratne had stated that the case had been a fabricated one. The 400 page judgement acquitted Dr.Senaratne from all charges.
Dr. Senaratne had not supplied medical equipment and the case had been filed against him because he had criticized the Government while being an opposition MP.
"The medical equipment imported under an agreement between the Government and the relevant companies. The case was filed just before the court vacation and Minister Rajapaksa had obtained money for representing Government for the case," he said.

Reclaiming Education
A common refrain today among many in Jaffna town is about its youth perpetuating social evils.
Offering a ready analysis of post-war Jaffna society, they are often quick to point to the rowdy behaviour of youngsters who simply loiter on the roads and harass people, or are forever speaking on their mobile phones. This moral judgment is problematic in its generalisation. It not only fails to appreciate the complex reality faced by a generation that was born during a war, but also ignores the nature of transformation that our society has undergone.
Handy Perinbanayagam, a leading educationist, in his seminal article on Language in Education, published in 1955 has the following to say:
In the commerce between the school and the community there is a two way traffic. The child takes something from its home to the school and takes back something to the home. When epidemics break out schools are closed for we know what an admirable medium a school is for spreading measles and mumps. But we forget that it can also be an equally effective medium for spreading other things besides mumps and measles. Social and political ideals, rules of health, civic virtue also can be spread through schools. If the child absorbs these at school, he must spread them in the home.
Can this so-called epidemic with families be addressed through the admirable medium of the school Can education be a social force with far reaching effects on the community
Travails of education in the country
The education sector in Sri Lanka as a whole is faced with many challenges, including problems with the curriculum, a uniform centralised structure and the process of education policy development. Regions remain passive as they implement education policies formulated by the Centre.
The same standards are applied across regions that are varied; to schools with children living in socio-economic depravity and to urban schools attended by upper-middle class children. Such a structure seldom allows a process for providing bottom-up feedback or meaningful participation from the regions in the development of education policies.
The success of education itself is measured in terms of pass-rates and higher result achievements. Pressure of achieving pass rates is so high that the current school system virtually ejects students who are likely to perform poorly in exams out of its system altogether.
Formation of National schools and cluster schools have further deepened the disparities in the allocation of resources. The model of developing cluster schools contributes to school drop-out levels as many fail to transition from feeder schools into secondary schools.
With Sri Lankas education policy lying in international agencies and actors hands, there is further distancing of schools and teachers from policy decisions. Schools have failed to become agents of change in the communities.
Education policy clearly seeks to serve the middle-class. Those who are socially excluded and marginalised suffer within a system that does not serve their needs.
Crisis of education in Jaffna
Jaffna is historically acclaimed as a leading centre for Education. Jaffna middle-classes in particular gained social mobility through professional jobs due to the presence of a select popular schools. Disruption of schools due to war and displacement and the brain-drain of an educated middle-class population, has had a toll. These are challenges mainly within the confines of Jaffna town.
It is only when we speak to teachers and educationists working in marginalised schools that we realise the extent of the crisis. Like with the impact of the war on marginalised sections in the North, the crisis of education is multiplied in marginalised schools. The problems encountered in marginalised schools is reflective of the prevalent casteism, regional biases and economic oppression in Jaffna society.
Schools in rural locations, the out-lying islands, of oppressed caste communities, from working class families and slum dwellers in urban settings are marginalised. Students of such schools are from low-income earning families. Economic challenges are a major deterrent to their continuing education. Children from such marginalised schools suffer from malnutrition, low self-esteem and a lack of enthusiasm in education. The problems are further deepened when their marginality is reinforced by the neglect and disregard shown by teachers. Although many schools were provided with buildings and facilities under reconstruction programmes, it is the economic and social depravity of the marginalised communities which is posing challenges for the childrens education.
The post-war years have seen the ascendancy of caste-based discrimination in the Jaffna society. Schools are locations of caste-based oppressions. Children are often discriminated based on their caste backgrounds in the classrooms and in appointments to leadership positions. They are discouraged in their efforts to furthering their education by reminding them of their social status. The appointment of teachers and principals in schools are also subject to caste politics. Those from the dominant caste protest against the appointment of teachers and administrators who belong to oppressed castes.
Communities that were displaced for longer periods of time face challenges in rebuilding their schools. Reclaiming land and buildings belonging to schools is one such challenge. Some schools have been turned into refugee camps. For the Jaffna Muslims, rebuilding their schools after twenty-five years of displacement hinges on a proper resettlement policy that can ensure their permanent return. Furthermore, the vast destruction to property and livelihoods and the large-scale displacements pose serious challenges to reviving education in the Vanni region. Schools in the Vanni do not have enough teachers. School drop-outs in Mannar District is the highest in the North and necessitates a separate study. In this way, disparities and challenges in education are varied within the Northern Province.
While all these challenges remain, tuition centres are the most obvious signs of the malaise of education in Jaffna. There seems to be a strong belief that what could not be taught to children in a class of 30 can be effectively taught to 2,000 students crammed up in a tuition centre. However, there is no evidence by way of a substantial increase in pass rates to vouch of the effectiveness of tuitions. Parents spend a lot and teachers may get additional incomes, but this doesnt translate to meaningful learning for students. Instead the tuition syndrome undermines the public education system that is supposed to provide free and quality education.
Rebuilding society
The historical trajectory of education in Jaffna itself is complex. For some, education was merely about maintaining their social status by becoming doctors, lawyers and engineers. It was a means for gaining class mobility. Progressive educationists in Jaffna, however, put forward broader agendas for education. The historical mobilisations against caste oppression centred on reclaiming education, with demands for equal treatment in the classrooms and development of schools for the oppressed people. Such progressive struggles for education contributed to the emergence of writers and thinkers from marginalised communities.
Education was not limited to formal learning in classrooms alone. On the contrary, spaces for promoting a culture of debate and dissent were nurtured outside of formal schools. Sanasamuga Nilaiyam (Community Centres) became sites of vibrant debates, mobilisations and political education. It was only when militarisation and violence engulfed Jaffna that this approach to education came to a halt.
The challenges of an education system that is imposed from above and the socio-economic problems in the Jaffna society persist. However, in this context can education be revived Can schools become that admirable medium for the rebuilding of society It is only with a broader agenda for education and the awareness of its social force, can we forge plans for rebuilding society.

Ru Freeman to receive 2014 Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize for fiction
Sri Lankan-American writer Ru Freeman has been named the 2014 recipient of the Janet Hedinger Kafka Prize for Fiction, presented by the Susan B. Anthony Institute for Gender and Women's Studies at the University of Rochester. The annual award will be given for Freeman's poignant novel On Sal Mal Lane, which has received acclaim from The New York Times Book Review, USA Today, People Magazine and The Boston Globe.
Freeman will receive the award and $7,500 prize on Thursday, Oct. 23 at 5 p.m. in the Wells Brown Room of Rush Rhees Library on the University's River Campus. The event is free and open to the public. As part of the award ceremony, Freeman will give a reading from the novel and she will sign copies of her book during a reception after the event.
On Sal Mal Lane (Graywolf Press, 2013) was selected for the University's Kafka Prize by a panel of three reviewers from among 121 nominations. "In this haunting novel of a Sri Lankan neighborhood in the years leading up to the country's civil war, Ru Freeman explores the interactions, small events and increasing national tensions that gradually transform life on Sal Mal Lane," writes Kathy McGowan, chair of the Kafka Prize committee.
Speaking about the book, Freeman said that she wanted readers from many parts of the world to be able to relate to the way that life unfolds for the characters in her book, to feel that these children and this neighborhood could be their own. "I chose to focus on the children because their innocence in times of conflict helped me to maintain a certain distance from the situation, and to leave out my own opinions," said Freeman. "It allowed me to have compassion for everyone involved."
Freeman is a freelance journalist, speaker, teacher, and activist. Her creative writing has been featured in VQR, Guernica, and World Literature Today, and she blogs for the Huffington Post on literature and politics. She is a fellow at the Bread Loaf Writer's Conference, an artist in residence at Yaddo and Hedgebrook and a fellow at the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts. Her first novel, A Disobedient Girl (2009), and On Sal Mal Lane were long listed for the DCS prize for South Asian Literature and translated into multiple languages, including Italian and Hebrew.
The University's Janet Heidinger Kafka prize recognizes an American woman writer whose book-length work has been published in the previous year. Previous winners include Anne Tyler, Ann Patchett, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Toni Morrison, all of who won the award before becoming famous for their prose. The award honors Janet Heidinger Kafka, a young editor who was killed in an automobile accident as her career was beginning. Kafka's friends and family created the endowment that supports the award in memory of her high literary standards and personal ideals.
This year's selection committee was led by McGowan, education and women's studies librarian at the University's Rush Rhees Library, with Terry Platt, professor of biochemistry and biology at Rochester, and Katherine Manheimer, associate professor of English at Rochester.

Russia says downing of plane over Egypt was 'terrorist act'
RUSSIA: The Russian plane crash in Sinai, Egypt, was caused by a terrorist attack as traces of explosives have been found in the wreckage of the plane, Federal Security Service director Aleksandr Bortnikov told President Vladimir Putin.
"We can say that that [Sinai plane crash] was a terror act," Bortnikov told Putin. According to the FSB chief, experts analyzed passengers' belongings as well as the parts of the plane. "After the examination on all these objects, we have found traces of a foreign-made explosive substance," Bortnikov said.
"During the flight, a homemade device with the power of 1.5 kilograms of TNT was detonated. As a result, the plane fell apart in the air, which can be explained by the huge scattering of the fuselage parts of the plane," he added.
This not the first time that Russia has faced "barbarous terrorist crimes, more often without apparent causes, outside or domestic," said Putin, referring to explosions at a railway station in Volgograd in December 2013. "We haven't forgotten anything or anyone," Putin said. "The murder of our nationals in Sinai is among the bloodiest crimes in [terms of] the number of casualties."
Vladimir Putin has vowed to find and punish the culprits behind the Sinai plane attack. "Our military work in Syria must not only continue.

Suspects cornered amid police raid in Paris suburb, official says
A number of suspects are holed up in a building amid a major police operation in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, officials say, as the hunt continues for people believed to be involved in the deadly terrorist attacks that rocked the French capital five days ago.

Latest developments:
 1:32 a.m. ET: A series of explosions is heard in the area. It wasn't immediately clear whether the blasts were controlled explosions carried out by authorities.

 12:39 a.m. ET: An unspecified number of suspects have been cornered in a building in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, Mayor Didier Paillard said in an interview on French television early Wednesday.

 Police and soldiers have cordoned off the zone and all public transportation in the area has been halted.

 The operation is related to the search for suspects in the Paris attacks, police say.

Full story:
Witnesses have reported gunfire amid a police raid in the northern Paris suburb of Saint-Denis as authorities hunt for two suspects from Friday's deadly terrorist attacks who are believed to be at large.

Police blocked off roads early Wednesday in Saint-Denis, which is home to the Stade de France sports stadium where three suicide bombings took place Friday.

CNN affiliate BFMTV reported that police officers have been wounded by gunfire during a raid seeking one of the suspects in the wave of violence across Paris, which killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds more.

French police wouldn't comment on whether any officers had been shot in the Saint-Denis operation.

BFMTV reported that the police raid was linked to the hunt for the so-called "ninth suspect," who may appear in a video recorded by a witness to the attacks.

Police have been analyzing the video, which shows two gunmen inside a black car linked to the attacks and perhaps a third individual driving the car, French media reported.

Seven of the attackers were killed during the wave of violence Friday night, and an international arrest warrant is already out for one suspect, Salah Abdeslam, a 26-year-old Frenchman. The identity of the possible ninth suspect is unknown. (CNN)

Swaying between potential and trouble
Former President J.R. Jayewardenes Cabinet, in 1977, had three leadership aspirants.
They were Ranasinghe Premadasa, Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake who held key ministerial portfolios in President Jayewardenes Cabinet.
It was crystal clear from the very outset that the three ministers were vying for all-powerful Executive Presidency after Jayewardenes second term. Jayewardene, an astute politician to the core, used this intra-party rivalry for the benefit of the government which introduced a string of drastic economic and political reforms within a period of 12 years.
Jayewardene placed vital projects of his government under Premadasa, Dissanayake and Athulathmudali, allowing the three ministers to project themselves as potential Heads of State, after his retirement.
Athulathmudali, a newcomer to the Parliament, was given a Cabinet Ministerial portfolio and his flagship project was the Mahapola fund which strengthened the countrys higher education sector for more than three decades. Hundreds of thousands of university students from rural areas were greatly benefitted by the Mahapola fund over the past 30 years as a result of Athulathmudalis farsighted strategy.
He also held an important position under the Jayewardene Cabinet as the Minister of Defence. It was the initial stage of the Tamil militant movement and Athulathmudali was entrusted with the task of crushing it militarily. Although Athulathmudalis efforts were hampered by a surfeit of external issues beyond his control, he achieved remarkable success with the Vadamarachchi operation, in 1987, which confined the LTTE militants to a tiny strip of land. Although the operation had to be abandoned after Indias intervention, Minister Athulathmudali, alongside senior military officials like General Denzil Kobbekaduwa and Wijeya Wimalaratne, gained immense popularity as a capable leader who could lead the country one day!
Lalith AthulathmudaliMinister Rajitha SenaratneGamini DissanayakeMinister Patali Champika Ranawaka
Jayewardene appointed Gamini Dissanayake, who secured his Nuwaraeliya seat comfortably at the General election in 1977, as the Minister of Mahaweli Development. the Mahaweli development project, a flagship project of the Jayewardena government, was placed under Dissanayake as he was a trusted lieutenant of the former President.
The Mahaweli development project, which was expected to take 30 years, was completed within six years as a result of Dissanayakes hands-on leadership. The project, which covered a large area of land, focused on irrigation, hydropower generation, agriculture, town and country development while triggering a quantum leap in terms of economic development.
In addition to his role at the Ministry of Mahaweli Development, he was also the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board in the early 1980s and helped the country to gain the Test Status in cricket.
On the other hand, he played a pivotal role in signing the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord in 1987 under tumultuous circumstances and ensured the setting up of Provincial Councils as a solution to the North and East problem.
Ranasinghe Premadasa, after he was appointed as the Prime Minister of the J.R. Jayewardene administration, undertook the task of sheltering the poor. The programmes he initiated under the Jayewardene administration included Jana Saviya, the instrument he used to help the poor, a foster parents scheme, the Gam Udawa project with which he tried to stir up the stupor in the villages, the mobile secretariat whereby he took the central government bureaucracy to the peasants, the Tower Hall Foundation for drama and music, and the pension schemes he initiated for the elder artistes.
In the hindsight, many political analysts believe that the country- at large benefitted from the three Prime Ministerial aspirants in the Jayewardene Cabinet.
Leadership aspirants in present Cabinet
It is in the grapevine among political circles that there are three Prime Ministerial (and Presidential) aspirants in the present Cabinet too. According to rumours emanating from the corridors of power, they are Ministers Rajitha Senaratne, Patali Champika Ranawaka and Nimal Siripala de Silva. Both Senaratne and Ranawaka, although they contested the Parliamentary election on the UNP ticket, are considered close allies of President Sirisena. It is observed by many that the three politicians are positioning themselves as future leaders of the countrys national politics. Since politics is a game revolving around power, no one can find fault with them for being Prime Ministerial or Presidential aspirants.
However, there is one striking difference between the Prime Ministerial aspirants of the Jayewardene Cabinet and those of the current government. Although Premadasa, Athulathmudali and Dissanayake projected themselves as future leaders of the country by undertaking giant projects, the Prime Ministerial and Presidential aspirants of the present government are attempting to reach their personal goals by triggering media shows and controversies. It also indicates that the leadership aspirants of the present Cabinet are not hesitant to pursue their objectives at the expense of the image and the reputation of the entire government.
It is against this backdrop that one has to analyze their involvement in the controversy surrounding Avant Garde private security firm. Senaratne and Ranawaka pushed hard for the removal of Law and Order Minister Thilak Marapana and called for stern action against the company.
During the Cabinet meeting two weeks ago, Senaratne and Ranawaka said the governments position on the security firm was not in line with the tenets of good governance. Responding to their remarks, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said the governments position on the matter was based on the Attorney Generals observations with regard to the security firm. He said there were no grounds to take legal action against the company over the floating armoury near the Galle harbour.
This resulted in a verbal battle between Senaratne and Rajapakshe who tried hard to defend their positions in the eyes of the media.
Rajapakshe openly challenged the media statement made by Senaratne on Thursday, after a meeting on the Avant Garde issue chaired by the President. While responding to Rajapakshes claims, Senaratne called the latter a Goda Perakadoruwa indicating the Justice Minister was not fit enough to be a lawyer.
Senaratnes remark provoked Rakitha Rajapakshe, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshes son, who went on to claim that Senaratne was a third class media spokesman. Posting a statement on his Facebook profile, Rakitha said: The third class media spokesman of the Governmnet of Sri Lanka has officially made a split of the Government. If he calls my father a goda perakodoruwa he is a bloody  (edited out) who was sacked from the parliament for selling expired medicine to Sri Lanka Army. That was the first and only time an MP was sacked from Parliament by Courts of Sri Lanka.
There was another dimension to the battle between Rajapakshe and Senaratne. In the case where Senaratne was unseated from Parliament for doing business with the State while being an MP in April, 1999, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe appeared for the petitioner Dilan Perera, a Deputy Minister of the then Peoples Alliance Government. Former Minister K.N. Choksy, a veteran lawyer, appeared on behalf of Senaratne who was then an MP of the UNP.
The feud between Senaratne and Rajapakshe was widely reported in media and some even dubbed it as an internal power struggle within the national unity government. The two ministers and their close associates were fueling the controversy on a daily basis with fiery remarks, attacking the positions of each other.
Wijeyadasa and Senaratne ordered to keep quiet
When there were strong indications that the matter was blowing out of proportion, both the President and the Prime Minister instructed Senaratne and Rajapakshe to refrain from attacking each other over the Avant Garde controversy. The Prime Minister advised his party member Rajapakshe to keep quiet and the President decided to speak to Senaratne over the matter. The President and the Prime Minister told the two ministers that their verbal battle was not helping the government in finding a solution to the problem.
The other Prime Ministerial aspirant of the government Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva gave rise to another controversy last week by openly criticizing the government during a public meeting he held in Badulla. The minister said not even a trace of yahapalanaya exists in the present government. According to certain media reports, the minister had said that the people, who were deceived by Facebook, made a mistake on January 08.
The outcome of the Presidential election on January was President Maithripalas Sirisenas ascension to power. President Sirisena is the present leader of the SLFP of which de Silva too holds a very senior position. Had President Sirisena lost the Presidential election on January 08, former President Rajapaksa would have continued in office for six years. The Ministers statement indicated that he preferred former President Rajapaksa to be the leader of the country for the next six years. Interestingly, he has made this remark while serving as a senior Cabinet minister of President Sirisenas government and functioning as a senior office-bearer of the SLFP.
It is clear that de Silva, through his statement, tries to cater to the sentiments of the grassroots level supporters of the SLFP. The grassroots level supporters of the party voted for Rajapaksa at the Presidential and Parliamentary elections this year, although the party ended up on the losing side. There is no justifiable reason to believe that the grassroots level members of the party are greatly supportive of the SLFP Central Committees decision to enter into a national unity government with the UNP.
As the Local Government election is just a few months away, the party now has to go to the doorsteps of its grassroots level supporters again. The party also has to defend its decision to form a national unity government with the UNP, against the will of the grassroots level members of the party.
It is against this backdrop that de Silva has resorted to attack the national unity government of which he too is a minister. Other SLFP ministers in the government too will resort to the same strategy in the near future. Some of them may even resign from their ministerial portfolios just to gain the sympathy of the village level SLFP supporters.
However, the core issue is the SLFPs indecisiveness on their position at the Local Government election. Soon after the Parliamentary election in August, there were signs that the SLFP was trying to distance itself from the UPFA coalition.
At this point, it is evident that the party is striving to form an alliance of some sort before facing the Local Government election. When contacted by the Daily News, SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake said the party was still holding discussions with several other parties to form an alliance to contest the Local Government election. However, the Minister refused to divulge the names of the political parties presently in talks with the SLFP.
At the same time, some minor constituent parties of the UPFA, including the National Freedom Front, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya and the National Freedom Front, are currently holding discussions to contest the elections separately under a pro-Rajapaksa alliance.
SLFPs confusion
On the other hand, President Maithripala Sirisena has already stated that he will lead the SLFPs campaign at the Local Government election. Even if the SLFP manages to form an alliance before the Local Government election early next year, the alliance will be led by President Sirisena.
Interestingly, minor constituents of the UPFA are not willing to enter into the electoral fray under the Presidents leadership. They push for former President Rajapaksas active involvement in the election campaign. They assert that grassroots level voters of the party still not ready to accept President Sirisenas leadership and as a result the party will suffer a landslide defeat at the Local Government election. Leader of the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya and UPFA Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila, addressing a press conference in Colombo, said explicitly that they would not contest the election under the Presidents leadership.
UPFA Parliamentarian and SLFP Pathadumbara Organizer Lohan Ratwatte too expressed similar sentiments, while speaking at a pocket meeting in his electorate a few days ago. The Parliamentarian said the party would not be able to win the Local Government election if President Sirisena led its campaign.
SLFP grassroots level members oppose the leadership of President Sirisena as they believe he is responsible for the SLFPs debacle, Ratwatte, a cousin of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said, while inviting SLFP Parliamentarians holding positions in the Yahapalana government to defect from the ruling camp and work for the victory of the SLFP.
Meanwhile, some seniors of the party have already aligned themselves with the minor constituent parties of the UPFA without any approval from the partys Central Committee. For instance, party seniors such as Kumara Welgama and Dullas Alahapperuma play key roles in the so-called united opposition and even chair its meetings, while keeping the party in the dark about their initiatives. They also hold positions in the SLFP and take part in meetings of the partys decision-making bodies.
It is in this context that the SLFP decided to convene its Central Committee meeting on Tuesday evening. The Central Committee has to make a quick decision on the partys position on the Local Government election because the government has already decided to hold the election without further postponement. If all goes well, the Local Government election is likely to take place in March, 2016.
While preparing for the Local Government election, the government has also decided to proceed with comprehensive constitutional reforms. As promised during its election campaign early this year, the government is now exploring the possibility of introducing a new constitution, with a total abolition of Executive Presidency. President Sirisena gave the first message in this regard, when he addressed the funeral of Ven Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera last week.
Jayampathy heads consultative committee on constitutional reforms
A committee, headed by Parliamentarian Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne, has already been appointed to take measures with regard to constitutional amendments. Among its members are senior lawyer Suren Fernando and Additional Secretary (Legal) to the Prime Minister Bimba Thilakaratne.
Prof. Suri Ratnapala, a veteran in the field of legal studies, is likely to be the governments chief consultant when formulating the new constitution.
Prof. Ratnapala, who was in Sri Lanka for a brief visit last month, held several rounds of discussions with the top rung leadership of the government on the matter.
During the discussion, Professor Ratnapala, who is currently based in Australia, has agreed to take up the task.
Ratnapala is presently a Professor of Public Law and Director of the Centre for Public, International and Comparative Law in the School of Law at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.
Ratnapala served as a Senior State Counsel, representing the Sri Lankan state in landmark constitutional cases before he migrated to Australia where he completed masters and doctoral degrees before accepting tenure at the University of Queensland. He was appointed to the Chair of Public Law in 2001, in Australia.
Prof. Ratnapala, in 2014, gave expert opinion to the Bar Association of Sri Lanka on the applicability of the 18th Amendment with regard to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa seeking a third term. Although he said the former President Rajapaksa was disqualified for a third term in office, the then government proceeded with their election plans, without taking the experts view into consideration.
When contacted by the Daily News on Monday, Dr. Wickremaratne said the committee, headed by him, would only act as a body of experts to advise the government on constitutional matters.
All political decisions have to be taken by the Parliament. Even the nature of the constitutional amendments should be determined by Parliament. We only act as a body of experts to guide them in the correct direction. We have nothing to do with political decisions, Wickramaratne explained.
Meanwhile, a spokesman of the government who wished to remain anonymous said the government had decided to totally abolish the Executive Presidency and it would come into effect after the first term of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The President and the Prime Minister have already stated that a new constitution will be presented to Parliament in 2016. It will be passed before September, 2017, as a new constitution requires the support of a two third majority in Parliament. So, the current national unity government will be entrusted with the task of passing the new constitution, he explained.
He also added that the government would go for a referendum on the new constitution if the need arises.
Although the government promised introduced a new constitution in its election manifesto, there are differences of opinion over the nature of the new constitution. Therefore, it would be essential to hold a referendum after passing the new constitution in Parliament, the spokesman said.

He is very much particular about the way you should spell his name. Anyone should be able to pronounce a name properly, he believes. And thus spelling his name is even easier than eating a piece of cake. It simply goes as Ananda Dias-Jayasinha - no more complex 'ghe's. That preciseness is very much alive in his works too. An engineer by profession, Ananda Dias-Jayasinha found inspiration in confused histories of missionary schools - which included his own Alma Mater, Richmond College. That rarely taken journey reached a pinnacle when Dias-Jayasinha won the State Literary Award for the best miscellaneous work of 2014 (other nominated works being Neville Jayaweera's Jaffna Exorcising the Past and Holding the Vision and P Pushparathnam's Tourism and Monuments).
Q: Why do you write
A: I never wrote in my life except a few technical manuals when I was working overseas in Australia although they were collaborations. More than a writer I am an avid reader. I remember the time in Galle when my father would get up around 3 am to read the Daily News. It is the time that the distributors would bring it to Richmond Hill. However newspaper vendor opened his shop around 7 am.
So it was arranged that the papers be left in the open veranda of our house until the shopkeeper came for it. The van driver and his assistant were in the habit of throwing the whole bundle of paper onto our veranda rather than gently delivering it. The bundle, when thrown on to the veranda, landed with a big thud the sound of which made my father wake up. It was his alarm.
I usually woke up with him so that I could get my father to explain the cartoon strips. Thus I got the habit of reading from my father. During that tender age I could not understand most of what was written. But with my father's help and armed with a dictionary I managed. My father would tell me to read from top left of the newspaper front to the bottom right of the last page a habit that has remained with me to date. I was born with a hearing defect that caused me to read my schoolbooks rather than trying to understand what the teachers told me in the class.
For instance I would look for many books as possible say of chemistry or physics and would try to understand different views of the authors. I had my education after the eight standard in English. Though my mother tongue is Sinhalese in my household the standard language of communication was English; the reason being my parents knew I will pick up mother tongue Sinhalese in any case but not English.
Q: What made you dig into the forgotten history of Richmond College
A: In early 1960's when I was around 12 or 13, I stumbled upon the 1951 Diamond Jubilee Souvenir of Richmond, which in the opening pages spoke of a school that started in 1814 as the first Wesleyan Methodist Mission School in Ceylon and in Asia and Richmond's special connection to it, while we were being taught that the School started in 1876. It was very confusing and I turned to my grandfather who was a Richmondite during the Rev Darrell's time and a contemporary of C W W Kannangra. He explained that Richmond was the continuation of the First English School, known as The Galle School, started by the Methodist Missionaries in Asia and in Ceylon (Sri Lanka).
Thus why was the school teaching us it started in 1876 shedding 62 years of important history I sought answers from every source without success and I was determined to get to the bottom of this. I started to gather information and found most of the information to the relevant period mainly from the Bodleian Library of the Oxford University and the archives of the New York public Library (NYPL). Sifting through almost 270 official documents of the Methodist Mission, nearly 605 Imperial Colonial papers and almost 100 publications, I made notes of the pertinent information for nearly 10 years that finally led me to author the book which took me about three more years.
I wanted to share the knowledge and the historical information that I gathered about Richmond with many who were not aware of the school. When I researched I found that many schools in the country have a dubious chronicle.
Some of them perhaps for the sake of prestige has backdated the beginning of their school while some in ignorance has come to accept even dates that have got advanced by many years.
If I take Richmond as an example, she started in 1814 as an elementary English school and then over the years progressed and in 1876 was made a high school -thus her beginning is 1814 and not 1876. For a school to become a high school is has to start at grass roots grow over the years before it can become high school. As far as Richmond is concerned it is on record that in a letter sent by the Rev Samuel Langdon to the Methodist Headquarters in England in 1877 he says that two student of the school entered Ceylon Medical School while several others passed the Calcutta University exam.
It is not possible for students of a newly started school to attain the high standards required to enter medical school or a university. Nowhere in the world a high school have been started overnight as it is impossible.
Q: What kind of books do you like to read most
A: I read anything that I get to hand and I have no preference to a genre. If I can gather knowledge and learn things that I didn't know or don't know I will read such books. I read both English and vernacular there again no particular category. However books set in the background of years of yore interests me.
Q: What have you got to tell the worst critic of yours
A: That's an interesting conundrum. In turn, I would tell him or her "not to worry about what I am doing, but to worry about why he or she is worried about what he or she is doing!"
Q: Looking back, do you wish if you could edit your first book
A: If your question is related to the contents then no. But I did find some grammatical errors that have slipped through two copyeditors, which I would like to correct.
Q: What is your opinion about literary awards
A: It is a good thing that would be an inspiration to others who are not regular authors. It is good to be recognised for whatever the effort that one had made in putting together the research done or weaving a factious or a fiction story that would keep a reader spellbound.
It is not an easy task to write a book be it fiction or nonfiction.

It needs lot of effort, logical thinking and burning midnight oil sometimes for months if not for years.
One has to be convincing of what goes into his or her work.
During the launch of my book I said that this was going to be my first and the last book. But I have changed my mind and already started on two books.
Q: Out of the award-winning books and popular books, which category appeals to you most
A: Without a doubt award-winning books would appeal to me most. If what you mean by popular books are the so called popular fiction such as romance, fantasy, crimes, fiction &c., then I would read them for relaxation.
Q: Have you got any special reading habit like reading while eating
A: Oh no! My wife Preethie will not think of it even if you mean dinner or lunch. That habit is tabooed.
If you are asking me whether I would munch snacks, the answer is I do it rarely since I need both my hands when using the computer and a third hand I wish I had.
I don't except for the notes I make put my thoughts interpretations to paper but would rather key into the computer as it would save me lot of time.

Two Air France flights bound for Paris diverted amid anonymous bomb threats
Two Air France flights headed from the United States to Paris were diverted Tuesday night due to bomb threats, officials said.
Both flights landed safely.
Flight 65, headed from Los Angeles to Paris, was diverted to Salt Lake City after a bomb threat was called in from the ground, a U.S. government official said.
The official did not know if anyone was arrested and was not aware of any unruly passengers on board.
Shortly afterward, Air France Flight 55 from Washington's Dulles International Airport to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris was diverted to an airport in Halifax, Nova Scotia -- also due to a bomb threat, a government source said.
The source did not know if the same person called in both threats.
"Several law enforcement agencies are working to determine the nature of the threats which caused the aircraft to divert," FBI Special Agent Todd Palmer of the Salt Lake City division said.
No U.S. military aircraft were scrambled in either of the reported Air France incidents, NORAD spokesman Preston Schlachter said.
"Diversion of flights are the most draconian response to a bomb threat," CNN national security analyst Juliette Kayyem said. "I think right now we take this seriously until we hear some explanation to the validity of the bomb threat."
Passengers questioned by FBI
Passenger Trevor Moran was headed to Paris from Los Angeles to shoot a music video on Flight 65.
He said the pilot came on and said the plane had to make an emergency landing.
"There were huge buses when we landed that they loaded us all on," he told CNN.
"Everyone on the flight is waiting in this lobby. Nobody knows what's going on."
Keith Rosso, who was on the same flight, said he had just finished dinner when the flight staff abruptly took trays away and said the plane was landing due to 'unsafe flying conditions."
Rosso said the FBI was interviewing passengers on Flight 65.
As for Flight 55, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the plane and luggage will be searched for explosives, the agency tweeted.

## Title: Uncapped Jayasundara, Vandersay for NZ tour

Kaushal Silva, Thirimanne dropped from Test squad
Uncapped Jayasundara, Vandersay for NZ tour
Sri Lanka cricket selectors named two uncapped players batsman Udara Jayasundara and leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay and dropped batsmen Kaushal Silva and Lahiru Thirimanne from the Test squad of 15 named for the tour of New Zealand next month.
The squads for the One-Day International and Twenty20 series were also picked.
Both Silva and Thirimanne have been struggling for form in the recent home Test series against West Indies and their places in the team will be taken by Kusal Mendis who has been promoted to be Dimuth Karunaratnes new opening partner and, Udara Jayasundara who has been given the task of filling the vital number three slot.
Jayasundara, a 24-year-old left-hander from Ananda College who represents Ragama CC in the Premier league has scored 10 centuries in 56 first-class matches which include a highest score of 222.
Mendis, 20 made his Test debut in the West Indies series and scored 13 and 39 batting at number three.
We have selected the squads solely on current form which has been the determining factor in the process, said chairman of selectors Kapila Wijegunawardene.
We have kept faith in the players who have shown form in the recent tour to New Zealand with the Sri Lanka A team and picked Jayasundara and Kithuruwan Vithanage, he said.
Wijegunawardene said that Kaushal Silva was dropped because the selection committee felt that he wasnt playing his natural game and his performances was not upto the expectations of the team.
We left Thirimanne out to give him time to sort out his form and regain his confidence, he said.
In Silvas case it was more than his failure to contribute the factor that weighed against him was his over cautiousness. He crossed the fifty mark only once in his last 11 innings.
Thirimanne on the other hand has not scored a Test hundred since March 2013 and gone through 28 innings scoring just two fifties. The left-hander however retains his place in the ODI squad.
In the absence of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara who are now retired and the exclusion of Kaushal Silva and Thirimanne the Sri Lankan batting line up will have a new look with the inclusion of players like Kusal Mendis, Udara Jayasundara, Kithuruwan Vithanage, Kusal Perera and Milinda Siriwardana with a heavy responsibility lying on the shoulder of skipper Angelo Mathews. The bowling unit has not undergone any major changes but for the inclusion of Jeffrey Vandersay. The 25-year-old leggie has been knocking on the door for recognition with some sterling performances for the Board Presidents team and the Sri Lanka A side in the past few months and richly deserves his selection. He has been included not only in the Test squad but also in the other two formats as well. Jeffrey has performed well and we thought a wrist spinner would be of value to the side. His selection will depend on the conditions and pitches in New Zealand, but nevertheless we have picked him with a long term view, said Wijegunawardene.
Hard hitting right-hander Chamara Kapugedera has been named in the ODI and T20 squads. In recent times Kapugedera has been picked to play only in the shortest format T20, but his inclusion for the ODI matches is an indication the selectors think he can still deliver in that format as well. He last played in an ODI in 2012.
Sri Lanka will play a series of two Tests, five ODIs and two T20Is during their five-week tour that commences with a three-day warm-up game against a New Zealand Board Presidents XI at Queenstown on December 3.

Unmanned boat causes flutter in Rameswaram
The pilgrim town of Rameswaram was agog with speculation on Monday after locals at Pamban sighted an unmanned fiberglass boat drifting close to the seashore, but the security agencies and people's fear that it could be another clandestine boat to ferry refugees to Northern Sri Lanka was quickly dispelled.
A group of Pamban fishermen led by Mariappan, on sighting the unmanned boat quickly caught hold of it and steered it safely to the shores with the help of ropes. They then informed the coastal security group police who examined the fiberglass vessel in detail.
Even as the police got in touch with their counterparts in other coastal police stations, they were able to ascertain that the boat belonged to one Arumugam of R. Pudupattinam in coastal Pudukkottai district.
Initial enquiries reveal that in the heavy winds amid the vigorous Northeast monsoon rains, Arumugam's boat had swept away the fiberglass boat from its moorings in Pudukkottai coastal village and it had been driven by the winds to reach the Pamban shores.
Arumugam confirmed the details of the boat and came over to Pamban to collect his boat, sources said.
The State Intelligence Q-branch police and coastal security police heaved a sigh of relief on learning that the unmanned boat, which drifted across from Pudukkottai district to Ramand coast could be identified as an Indian one, in the backdrop of a Sri Lankan fiberglass boat being sighted at Narikuzhi in October and no clue yet on the people who are believed to have sailed in it to reach the Indian shores, sources added.

## Supertitle:

Ven. Sobitha Thera and the imperatives of true tribute
I first met Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera almost a decade ago, through my father-in-law Padmavarna Wijayatilake. The first impression made a mark on me. There was an aura about Sobitha Hamuduruwo. Thats why when a friend, Martin Pieris, wanted to write a book about prominent Sri Lankan personalities, I said that Sobitha Hamuduruwo not only has to be in it, but deserves to be featured in the cover.
In all my encounters thereafter, the impression I had of Sobitha Hamuduruwo as a visionary and a fearless leader who could mobilize people to a just cause, was reaffirmed time and again. He had a good understanding of the state of things in the country. He had a vision of what this country could be and he had a road map that would take the country there. Most of all, he had the patience and will so necessary to make it all a reality.
Sobitha Hamuduruwo always championed the causes that he considered were just. He never worried about consequences which were often harsh and included injuries to his person. Despite this, he seldom focused on the identity of the person or party that caused him injury, choosing instead to concentrate on systems and processes that produced such outcomes. What ever the consequences, he never lost sight of the objectives that prompted him to choose a particular course of action.
He was not alone in sensing the destructive and undemocratic path taken by Mahinda Rajapaksa, but to his credit, even as he took on the man, he understood intimately, that the individual was the product of a serious systemic flaw.
This does not mean that he didnt criticize the individual. When General Sarath Fonseka was arrested, he was quick to point out what others knew, but were scared to articulate: The defeat of the LTTE was being converted into a 'family victory.
He recognized the need for Mahinda Rajapaksa to be defeated, but more importantly, he saw that such an eventuality was but a single and insufficient step in what had to be a longer journey towards establishing constitutional safeguards against dictatorial rule. This is the he worked hard for almost five years to build a common programmatic platform through the efforts of civil society, rather than political actors to defeat Mahinda Rajapaksa. This is how the National Movement for Social Justice came into being.
Sobitha Hamuduruwo held extensive discussions, initially with Karu Jayasuriya, Dr. Ranjith Cabraal, Jayampathi Wickramaratne, Nirmal Ranjith Devasiri and J.C. Weliamuna and later with a large number of other individuals and organizations. They concluded that the one idea that could unite the diverse political forces was the abolishing of the executive presidency. He participated in over 200 meetings around the country to mobilize people to this idea. He did this amid many challenges, but eventually, all major parties and civil society organisations rallied to support him.
The first step was to push all parties and political leaders to agree on a common candidate. By the middle of 2014, there were many who wanted Sobitha Hamuduruwo to come forward as the common candidate against Mahinda Rajapaksa, but he encouraged Ranil Wickremesinghe and Chandrika Kumaratunga to find someone else, since he felt it was wrong for a member of the clergy to be the constitutional head of a democracy. He was particularly disappointed that sections of the state-run media relentlessly attacked him of having personal political ambitions, but he did not allow this disillusionment to distract him from the broader political project. Indeed, throughout the process, Sobitha Hamuduruwo focused more on the objective of institutional reform rather than a change of personalities.
That was how he saw things, always. It was all about the country. He knew the LTTE had to be defeated but was always distressed by the fact that citizens of the country were killing one another. He was a nationalist for all citizens and their rights, regardless of their ethnic identity or religious faith. Even in the run up to the Presidential Election, his focus was on an idea and a winning concept. It was this concept that the people rallied around, the concept of abolishing the Executive Presidency and establishing Good Governance.
That concept was essentially prefaced by the conviction that systems must be changed so that replacements wont be worse than the replaced, as he argued had always been the case. He made it clear that replacing Mahinda Rajapaksa was less important than changing the system that produced dictatorships.
Sobitha Hamuduruwo was convinced that the position, given constitutional provisions, made incumbents feel they are above the law. He knew through experience that few if any would tell such individuals the truth because the position and the power embedded in it was so intimidating. After a while, he argued, regardless of rhetoric about being custodians and not owners, rulers behave as if they own the country.
His efforts made the entire world think about Sri Lanka, much in the same way that the country came into prominence due to the non-aligned efforts of Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranayake who was also the world's first female Prime Minister, the World Cup victory in 1996, the tragedy of the tsunami in 2004 and the defeat of the LTTE in 2009.
This time it was about a country coming together to overthrow a dictatorship, but creditably without bloodshed and most importantly about a programme that sought to create safeguards against dictatorial tendencies. Sobitha Thero made it happen. He championed an idea and created a winning concept. He led a movement that would ensure victory, regardless of who the candidate was. He kept politicians at a distance and for good reason. He knew they were mostly inclined to promise to build bridges even if there was no river. The exception perhaps was Karu Jayasuriya and even he was considered more a trusted friend rather than a creature of politics. This movement was not politician-led. It was a civil movement that sought not to bring a politician to power but to ensure system change.
Sobitha Hamuduruwo had expectations for the country. He was frustrated about recent developments, especially the slowness of the reform project. This frustration was and is shared by many. This is why there was reiteration of the commitment to Good Governance and the abolishing of the Executive Presidency from all quarters upon his death. In other words, even in his passing and may we say especially in his passing away, Sobitha Hamuduruwo had succeeded in reconscientizing the entire citizenry, reminding everyone that the journey is long, that winning a battle makes sense only if the war is also won.
Ven Maduluwawe Sobitha Thero is no more. While everyone wishes him the supreme bliss of Nibbana, in this lifetime, in this country, those who looked up to him as a visionary leader, if they are honest in their sorrow and truly wish to commemorate Sobitha Hamuduruwo, have to rededicate themselves to the cause that he championed. He envisioned a land where no one is above the law, a land where citizenship has meaning, a land without political patronage or nepotism, a land where robust systems with the right constitutional safeguards ensure that there can be no wrongdoing.
Such a land will be delivered only if the citizens take the initiative and do not leave it in the hands of politicians who may, as they often have, waver when personal agendas come into play.
We have to ask ourselves if we find ourselves living in such a land and if the answer is no then we have to relentlessly work towards securing for ourselves such a land that Sobitha Hamuduruwo envisioned for all of us. In short, it is incumbent on all those who identified with Sobitha Hamuduruwos project to visit their conscience again and again and to test word and deed against the concepts he championed, for he set up for all of us a framework for proper and principled political conduct.
That alone would be a tribute to this visionary Sri Lankan, this exceptional Buddha-Putra whose guidance and leadership we are all privileged to have benefitted from. Sobitha Hamuduruwo must chair, so to speak, every discussion on good governance and sorely needed political reform. He cannot be forgotten and those who do so, would never be forgiven by the people of this country.
