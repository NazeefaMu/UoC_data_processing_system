Indian CEO Forum urges Indian private sector to take advantage of Budget 2018, Vision 2025
Umesh Gautam, President of The Indian CEO Forum, the preeminent representation for Indian investment in Sri Lanka, issued the following statement on the governments 2018 budget as part of its Vision 2025 plan.
The Indian CEO Forum welcomes the proposals made by the Finance Minister for the forthcoming year through the new budget. Without delving into the minutiae of the budget, we would like to express our views on some of the broader policy objectives prioritized in the budget from a foreign investment perspective. The Indian CEO Forum represents some of the earliest foreign direct investments into Sri Lanka. These Indian investments have deep roots in the economic prosperity of Sri Lanka and are present reminders of the merits of foreign direct investment.
Despite the post-war potential, Sri Lanka has perpetually lagged in foreign direct investment entering the country and this has contributed to its fiscal weakness. This years budget, dubbed the 'Blue-Green budget; the Launch of Enterprise Sri Lanka' builds on the fiscal consolidation progress made over the last year while placing greater focus on structural reforms, trade liberalization, sustainability and unleashing the entrepreneurial spirit in Sri Lanka.
Since taking office, this government has been unequivocally clear in its objective to address Sri Lankas fiscal weaknesses and external debt situation as these issues permeate into factors such as monetary policy and exchange rate stability, important considerations for foreign investors. To their credit, the government has made progress since 2016 as revenue collection has improved whilst the deficit is expected to be 5.2% this year, down from 5.6% in 2016. We remain optimistic on the successful implementation of the new Inland Revenue Act which closes loopholes, introduces capital gains and broadens the tax base.
In the World Banks recently published Ease of Doing Business index Sri Lanka was ranked 111th out of 190 nations indexed. This governments Vision 2025 plan targets reforms that will push Sri Lanka to be in the top 70 positions on the index by reducing and streamlining regulatory red tape.
Therefore, it is encouraging that this years budget has an ambitious legislative reform agenda. A strong, fair and efficient legislative framework is very important to ferment a positive business environment while digitization and simplification of processes, and approvals will promote private sector investment. Timing and expediency will be important as all too often we see delays in implementation, an example being the foreign exchange act.
The focus on sustainability and the environment by way of incentives, a carbon tax, duty changes, solar power promotion, waste disposal initiatives, and coastal conservation measures are commendable and an important first step to a larger policy discussion on how to move Sri Lanka towards a clean and environmentally friendly economy.
This is one area where Sri Lanka can distinguish itself from its South Asian peers if it embraces the principles of a sustainable green economy. In this regard, one area that this budget under represented was the state of public transportation in Sri Lanka.
The state of public transportation has far reaching consequences pertaining to productivity, pollution and international branding and appeal. As Sri Lanka aims to transition to an upper middle-income country, it is incumbent on the government to provide a transport solution that reflects this anddistinguishes itself from itspeers. Solutions range from prolonged multi-year infrastructure investment to more cost-effective methods like effective scheduling utilizing a product mix for peak and off-peak, ensuring environmental standards and quality of service.
The Indian CEO forum advocates for Indian businesses to offshore part of their supply chain in Sri Lanka to re-export back to the Indian market. Geographically, Sri Lanka enjoys closer proximity to the Southern states of India than many of the Indian states in the North of the country which is an opportunity to compete for Indian domestic manufacturing capabilities if the right incentives are in place.
This budget commits to eliminating up to 1,200 para-tariffs which will help Sri Lanka integrate into international production networks by reducing input costs from imports to local manufacture. This strategy will greatly boost maritime trade and help Sri Lanka achieve its goal of becoming a regional trading hub.
Gautam, heading the oldest Indian investment in Sri Lanka, a joint venture company of Government of Sri Lanka, Lanka Ashok Leyland PLC, stresses that this is the right time that the Indian investor looks at Sri Lanka positively and take advantage of its economic prosperity planned in Budget 2018/Vision 2025 for Sri Lanka.

Investment options beyond fixed deposits and savings accounts
The majority of Sri Lankans invest their hard earned money in banks and finance companies in the form of fixed deposits and savings products. However, there are a number of other financial instruments available for investment for retail investors which includes the following.
1. Government securities
2. Listed debentures
3. Listed shares
4. Unit trusts
5. Insurance products
Below is a brief insight into each investment option and the risk factor:
1. Government Securities
Government securities are debt instruments issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka. Government securities are considered as the safest investment available for an investor. There are two types of government securities, namely treasury bills and treasury bonds. Treasury bills are short term securities with tenures of 91, 182 and 364 days. The treasury bonds consist of medium to long term government securities with tenures ranging from two years to 30 years. Treasury bills do not pay interest as they are issued at a discount to the face value while treasury bonds pay interest semi annually.
A retail investor could invest in a government security through a commercial bank or a primary dealer. Primary dealer is an intermediary appointed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka who is engaged in buying and selling of government securities.
2. Listed Debentures
Listed debentures are debt securities issued by business entities/corporates which are listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Corporates issue listed debentures to partly finance debt funding requirements. The major issuers of listed debentures in Sri Lanka are banks and finance companies. A retail investor could invest in listed debentures through a stock broker.
Listed debentures are riskier than investing in government securities and hence gives a higher return relative to government securities. An investor can have an idea of the default risk of a listed debenture based on the credit rating of the debenture. All listed debentures have a mandatory credit rating which is published by an approved credit rating agency. Higher the credit rating of a listed debenture, lower the incremental risk compared to a government security. In contrast, lower rated debentures carry a higher level of incremental risk over the government securities.
3. Listed Shares
Investing in listed shares is another investment option available to retail investors. Investing in shares involve taking an ownership stake in a business entity/corporate which entails risks associated with the business of the investee company. Hence, investing in listed shares carries the highest degree of risk (out of the investment options discussed in this article) and the investor is expected to have the required knowledge and expertise to analyze the investment prior to making investment decisions in listed shares. Listed shares have the potential to generate the highest return to an investor in the long run reflecting the highest level of risk associated. An investor can invest in listed shares through a stock broker.
4. Unit Trust
The three investment options discussed up to now, are direct investment instruments available to a retail investor. This requires investment management expertise and time from the part of the investor.
In contrast, unit trusts pool funds from a large number of investors and invest such pooled funds in different types of investment instruments. Unit trusts are managed by full time professional fund managers. Therefore, investing in unit trust is a convenient alternative for a retail investor who does not have the time and expertise to invest in first three types of investment instruments discussed above.
There are different types of unit trusts as tabulated in the table below which have specialized in investing in government securities, corporate debt and listed shares.
*Relative risk rank within unit trust categories
The risk profile of a unit trust depends on the asset class in which it invests in. For example, a growth fund which invest in listed equity is riskier than a gilt edged fund which is exposed to government securities.
5. Insurance Products
Life insurance companies offer different types of long term investment plans for retail investors. Such investment plans include savings plans, retirement plans, education plans for children etc.
Conclusion
The summary of risk return profile of different types of investment instruments are given in the table below.
Despite the availability of fairly a wide choice of alternative investment instruments, Sri Lankans pre-dominantly invest in fixed deposits and savings products of banks and finance companies. Lack of awareness, knowledge and poor access to intermediaries who distribute these products are the major deterrents for low level of penetration of these alternative investment instruments. With the development of technology which enables mobile lead distribution of financial services would certainly help in reaching the masses for these alternative investment instruments.

Iran hunts for survivors as quake kills scores near Iraq border
IRAN: Iranian rescue workers dug through rubble in a hunt for survivors on Monday after a major earthquake struck the Iran-Iraq border, killing over 350 and injuring thousands.
The 7.3-magnitude quake hit a border area 30 kilometres (20 miles) southwest of Halabja in Iraqi Kurdistan at around 9:20 pm on Sunday, when many people would have been at home, the US Geological Survey said.
The worst affected areas were in Irans western province of Kermanshah, where the coroners office told state television that around 350 people were dead and another 2,350 injured.
Across the border in Iraq, where the areas are more sparsely populated, the health ministry said eight people had died and several hundred been injured.
Some Iranians spent the night outdoors after fleeing their homes in the mountainous cross-border region, huddling around fires at dawn as the authorities deployed help to affected areas.
A woman and her baby were pulled out alive from the rubble in the Iranian town of Sar-e Pol-e Zaham, the worst hit in the quake, local media reported.
Officials said they were setting up relief camps but that access to the areas was not easy.
Irans emergency services chief Pir Hossein Koolivand said it was difficult to send rescue teams to the villages because the roads have been cut off... there have been landslides.
The official IRNA news agency said 30 Red Cross teams had been sent to the quake zone, parts of which had experienced power cuts.
Irans supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the government and armed forces to mobilise all their means to help the population. Local media reported hundreds of ambulances and dozens of army helicopters mobilised for rescue operations including in rural areas.
Sar-e Pol-e Zahab, an area of some 85,000 people close to the border, was the worst hit, with at least 236 dead, while the towns of Eslamabad and Qasr-e Shirin were also affected.
Some 259,000 people live in the areas around these towns, according to the latest population census.
State television footage showed tents, blankets, and food being distributed in areas hit by the quake.
At dawn on Monday in Sar-e Pol-e Zahab, buildings stood disfigured, their former facades lying in rubble on crumpled vehicles.
In an open space away from the wrecked housing blocks, men and women, some wrapped in blankets, huddled around a camp fire to keep warm.
In Iraq, the health ministry said the quake had killed seven people in the northern province of Sulaimaniyah and one in the province of Diyala to its south.
More than 500 people were injured in both provinces and the nearby province of Kirkuk.
Footage posted on Twitter showed panicked people fleeing a building in Sulaimaniyah, as windows shattered at the moment the quake struck, while images from the nearby town of Darbandikhan showed walls and concrete structures had collapsed.
In Darbandikhan, officials called on residents to sleep outside their homes as a precautionary measure. The quake, which struck at a relatively shallow depth of 23 kilometres, was felt for about 20 seconds in Baghdad, and for longer in other provinces of Iraq, AFP journalists said. In 1990, a 7.4-magnitude quake near the Caspian Sea in northern Iran killed 40,000 people and left 300,000 more injured and half a million homeless. Within seconds the quake reduced dozens of towns and nearly 2,000 villages to rubble.
Thirteen years later, a catastrophic quake struck the ancient southeast Iranian city of Bam, famed for its mud brick buildings, killing at least 31,000 people and flattening swathes of the city.
Since then, Iran has experienced at least two major quake disasters, one in 2005 that killed more than 600 and another in 2012 that left some 300 dead.
More recently, a 5.7-magnitude earthquake near Irans border with Turkmenistan in May killed two people, injured hundreds and caused widespread damage. - AFP

Iran-Iraq border earthquake is deadliest of 2017

A huge rescue effort is under way after a powerful earthquake struck Iran's mountainous border with Iraq, killing more than 400 people and injuring more than 7,000.
Teams are looking for survivors trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings.
The quake is the deadliest in the world this year.
Most people who died were in western Iran in Sarpol-e-Zahab, a town 15km (10 miles) from the border, and other parts of Kermanshah province.
The town's main hospital was severely damaged, leaving it struggling to treat hundreds of wounded people, state TV reported.
A woman and her baby were pulled alive from rubble in the town, Iranian media said.
Many buildings in the town appear to have collapsed, amateur video posted to Twitter by a radio station showed.
Running water and electricity cut out in some cities, and after buildings collapsed people were forced to spend hours outdoors in parks or streets in cold weather.
Many homes in the predominantly Kurdish mountainous area are made of mud bricks and are vulnerable in quakes as large as Sunday's.
"We need shelter," a man in Sarpol-e Zahab told state TV. "Where is the aid Where is the help"
One aid agency said 70,000 people needed shelter after the quake, and there were reports that thousands of people were facing a second night in the cold as dusk fell.
The UN said it was "ready to assist if required"in a statement from a spokesman for the secretary-general.
Iranian officials said 413 people had died in the country. Some soldiers and border guards were among the dead, the Iranian army's commander-in-chief told the state news channel IRINN.
In Iraq nine people died, a Red Crescent spokesman told the BBC. A UN office in the country said more than 500 people were injured there, and the earthquake was felt in Irbil, Sulaimaniya, Kirkuk and Basra as well as the capital, Baghdad.
Landslides have made it harder for rescuers to reach those affected in rural areas, and there are fears a dam could burst after it was damaged by the earthquake. People living nearby have reportedly been asked to leave.
The quake hit at 21:18 local time (18:18 GMT) about 30km (19 miles) south of Darbandikhan, near the north-eastern border with Iran, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said.
More than 1.8 million people live within 100km of the epicentre, the UN estimates.
The earthquake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 23.2 km, and tremors were felt in Turkey, Israel and Kuwait.
In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake destroyed the historic city of Bam in south-east Iran, killing 26,000 people.
Sunday's quake is the deadliest to hit Iran since 2012. But it is only the sixth earthquake of magnitude-7.0 or more in 2017 -there were 16 strong quakes last year and 19 the year before.
Why is Iran prone to earthquakes
Iran is one of those regions of the world that is all too familiar with quakes, and has experienced some very big tremors in the past.
In general terms, the big driver here is the clash between the Arabia and Eurasia tectonic plates. The former is pushing north by a couple of centimetres a year.
In the south-east of the country, the Arabia plate is actually pushing under the Eurasia plate, but in the north-west these great slabs rub directly against each other. The Zagros mountains are a result of all this compression.
Early reports indicate the quake occurred on a thrust fault. This means the crust on one side of the break in the rocks is moved vertically up and over the other side - which fits exactly with this general picture.
Geological agencies now produce immediate bulletins on the likely expected casualties. This modelling work is based on factors such as the size of the quake, population density and what is known about local construction methods. It's inexact work, but the first bulletins suggested this event could produce many hundreds of deaths and perhaps thousands of injured individuals.

Keeping the Hugger at Bay..!
Last Sunday Washington wore a worried frown, as foreign officials of the mightiest country in the world, met security personal, and senators met congressmen, Hes coming! they all whispered.
Who asked a new intern in Trumps team innocently, Whos coming
The Hugger! whispered a senior colleague, Now be quiet, lets listen how theyre going to deal with the hugger! They entered the room of very worried officials, We were caught unawares! said a secret service agent, We did not expect him to hug the president the last time he was here!
Is it an Indian tradition asked a Republican senator.
No sir, they frown at hugging down there, even have the police arresting anyone who hugs in public!
Then why come and hug here asked a visibly annoyed senator.
There was silence in the room.
The President seemed unhappy with the incident! said a security officer, Said it took him a lot of ironing to get rid of the creases from the bearhug!
He does hug passionately! observed another secret service agent.
Thats a threat to our Chief! whispered the same senator. You guys better come up with a solution, our President should not be the object of sudden assaults! We paid quite a price for the last one, with Pakistan wanting to do the same, even Bangladesh sending a formal request for a presidential hugging!
Gives Donald quite a tummy ache later; this holding and squeezing! said the senator angrily.
I could step between just when he is about to hug! suggested the secret service agent.
Would cause quite a diplomatic embarrassment! said the senator, And we know how prickly Indians are. We dont want him going over to Russia and hugging Putin the rest of his life!
Couldnt we put the First Lady between asked a foreign service official, whod not spoken till now, and showed some annoyance when the senator sniggered, Hell just lean across and hug our President! Brushing aside women doesnt bother him!
I think I have a solution, said the young intern who had come in as an observer.
Son, your job is to watch and be silent! whispered his senior colleague sternly to him.
Let him speak, said the senator, Weve run out of ideas to keep the Indian Prime Minister from hugging our President, what is it
Keep the photographers out! said the young intern, Hes not interested in the hug, hes interested in the billions in India seeing the pic; likes showing hes a friend of powerful people!
Brilliant! said the senator, Pass the word along, when the meeting is coming to a close, shove the photographers out!
That was very clever of you! said his senior colleague as they filed out, Just heard the Presidents given you a ten dollar raise for saving his suits from getting crumpled and creased..!

Kerosene mixed into petrol bowser in Dambulla
A large scale racket involving the adulteration of fuel (petrol) dispatched to outstation filling stations by mixing kerosene into the bowser itself was uncovered by STF officers in Dambulla when they caught a bowser crew engaged in the racket by parking their bowser in a granite mill in Makulugaswewa Galewela around noon on November 13.
When the STF team pounced on the spot, the driver of the bowser and his assistant had already broken the bowser seal and pumped petrol out of the bowser using a pipe and were in the process of attempting to introduce an equal amount of kerosene brought from a kerosene lorry into the bowser.
The driver of the batta lorry which brought the kerosene had escaped after sensing the STF raid. Dambulla police investigating the incident said the bowser owned by Trincomalee District UNP Parliamentarian M. A. M. Maharoof was transporting Indian Oil Company petrol to a filling station in China Bay Trincomalee.
Parliamentarian M. A. M. Maharoof when contacted on the phone said he was clueless about this racket as he had no connection what-so-ever to it. When there was a delay in the arrival of the bowser carrying petrol, he tried to speak to the bowser crew on the mobile phone but they were out of reach for a long period. Thereafter, he had advised the manager of the filling station to lodge a complaint with the Trincomalee Police about the delay. If the bowser crew had been involved in an illicit racket, he would hand them over to the Police for necessary action against them. The raid was conducted by an STF team led by Inspector L. Ranatunge following a tip-off by STF intelligence officers.

Thailand successfully hosted the annual World Jewellery Confederation meeting or CIBJO Congress 2017, emphasizing the countrys position as the worlds gems and jewellery trading hub.
The event welcomed renowned gems and jewellery traders worldwide, opening new opportunities to seek international partnerships.
General Prayut Chan-o-cha, Prime Minister of Thailand, presided over the CIBJO Congress 2017 opening ceremony on November 6.
It is an honour for Thailand to host this meeting which is beneficial to the domestic and international gems and jewellery industry as the congress offers members an opportunity to share information and experiences that may be utilized to efficiently develop the industry which is a key factor to the economic development of the nation. The gems and jewellery industry is an important part of Thailands economy, creating jobs and income for both large and small companies that employ over 1 million people in total. Related jobs in this industry range from stone selectors, craftsmen, cutting professionals to general labour while the gems and jewellery industry also creates value for other related industries, said General Prayut Chan-o-cha.
Thailand is determined to develop products to elevate the countrys gems and jewellery industry, with the goal to establish itself as the worlds gems and jewellery trading hub by 2021.
In the past few years, the Thai government has issued measures to promote this industry, from waiving the import duty for gems and jewellery, improving the quality and standards of jewellery, promoting businesses to seek partnerships for resources, educating the workforce, issuing marketing schemes to connect the industry to the tourism sector. We are confident that these measures will contribute to Thailands goal to become a trading hub in this industry, the Prime Minister added.
This year, Thailand received the honour to host the annual World Jewellery Confederation meeting or CIBJO Congress 2017 from November 5 to 7, 2017 at Shangri-La Hotel Bangkok which was an important gathering of professionals in the gems and jewellery industry worldwide where over 300 business people in the industry from 42 countries joined in the meetings, said Apiradi Tantraporn, Minister of Commerce.
Apart from discussions on various measures, the congress presented an opportunity for participants to build networks and strengthen relationships. Thai traders also took this opportunity to seek potential business partners with international gems and jewellery companies and organizations such as leading diamond traders De Beers, the CEO of leading gemstone traders Gemfields, representatives from world renowned organizer of jewellery and watch fair Vicenzaoro as well as an international environmental and social organization, the Minister of Commerce added.
In 2016, Thailand ranked as the country with the tenth-highest value of gems and jewellery exports (including gold), worth US$14.246 billion in 2016 (500 billion Baht) or 3.49 percent of the countrys GDP. In the first nine months of 2017 (January to September), export from this industry brought in over US$10.6 billion (364 billion Baht) and is one of the top-three exports of the country.

Liberalizing Sri Lankas  shipping and logistics sector
Maersk Line supports  Governments initiative
Maersk Line - The largest container shipping line globally and a market leader in Sri Lanka fully supports the 2018 Budget proposals made by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera to open up the shipping and logistics sector to foreign investments and introduction of an independent port regulator.
Managing Director India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh for Maersk Line, Steve Felder in a statement issued on the subject mentioned Maersk Line supports any efforts that governments make to liberalize and improve the business environment for the maritime industry, and for our customers.
In this spirit, we commend the proposals tabled in the Sri Lankan parliament last week, which included removing the restriction on foreign ownership of shipping agencies and amendment of the Merchant Shipping Act, which are intended to further support the development of Colombo as a key Maritime hub.
The liberalization of shipping agencies is expected to reduce transaction costs for carriers using Colombo as a transshipment hub thereby making it attractive for shipping lines like Maersk to further increase volumes especially given the growth of new transshipment hubs in this region.
Felder further mentioned that if the proposals tabled in the Parliament last Thursday which included removing therestriction on foreign ownership of shipping agencies, and the amendment of the Merchant Shipping Act, are approved, we will engage closely with our headquarters and our valued partners in Sri Lanka, and together evaluate options on increasing our footprint in Sri Lanka.
Maersk Line, the global containerized division of the Maersk Group has employees in 325 offices across 125 countries and a fleet of more than 500 vessels along with 1.9 million containers, with the global reach and resources to accommodate customers broad transportation needs.
Maersk Group, as a worldwide conglomerate, operates in over 140 countries and have a workforce of over 108,000 employees. In addition to owning one of the worlds largest shipping companies, they are involved in a wide range of activities in the transport, energy, logistics, retail and manufacturing industries.

Minister Kabir Hashim receives Global Evaluation Award
A national evaluation policy will be established through and Act of Parliament next year to ensure that there is accountability and flexibility regarding every cent invested on development projects by the government said Enterprise Development Minister and UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim.
He said this at a press conference held after receiving the Global Evaluation Award from President Maithripala Sirisena at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday.
He received this award for being the first Parliamentarian who lavishly contributed to advance the culture of evaluation in the context of sustainable development goals, emphasised on the need for national policies and extended support for global Parliamentarians in his capacity as the President of the Global Parliamentarians Forum.
Kabir Hashim who said that he was discussing this measure with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe added that this evaluation policy would be a framework to oversee investments made by the government to ensure that maximum results were obtained from every cent of public funds invested.
He said certain projects implemented did not bring results sufficient even to settle their loan installments.
Although loans amounting to billions of rupees had been received by the country since independence, there was a doubt as to whether the desired results have been obtained through investments made with such funds.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was also present when Minister Kabir Hashim received the award form President Sirisena.

MOHs in North Western Province to conduct sudden raids
The North Western Province (NWP) Health Ministry has directed all MOHs in both the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts, to crack down on hotels, canteens, inns, and eateries in the NWP as about 742 complaints have been received against these places where food with low-quality standards is served to consumers.
Some hoteliers have provided meals with cockroaches, plastic bits, nails and cigarette butts. Some sweetmeats have been found with dead lizards, weevils, etc. by consumers.
D. G. Rathnayake, a PHI of Giribawa in Kurunegala, told the media that 28 PHIs have been deployed by the NWP Health Ministry to conduct sudden raids on errant bakery owners, hotel owners and school canteen keepers within next two weeks.
About 14 school students and 211 garment factory girls were reported to have fallen ill due to food-poisoning after consuming unfit food during the last three months, from the NWP. Some bakery owners have not obtained a MC from the Regional Director of Health for manufacturing their products. It is a punishable offence according to the existing laws of the Food Act in Sri Lanka, PHI Rathnayake added.

MRs imaginary crisis
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, addressing the pohottuwa partys maiden rally, in Anuradhapura, on Sunday, claimed that the country was in crisis today, solely because his successor, President Maithripala Sirisena, appointed Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister of the country.
We are not aware as to the nature of the crisis, the country is confronted with, today. Suffice it to say that there are no white vans roaming about the streets, nor are journalists abducted and tortured, or worse, murdered in broad daylight. Nor are media houses subject to claymore attacks and razed to the ground. One also does not see entire roads being closed, and, the public shooed away, to allow VVIPs comfortable passage. The country is also being spared the oppressive family rule where the Rajapaksas had the last word on any and everything. There are also no giant cutouts at every street corner, with the beaming visage of the countrys ruler. Local government politicians are no longer killing foreign nationals and raping their girl friends, nor are those holding mayoral office giving chase to opposition politicians, brandishing toy pistols. Holders of the office of the countrys Chief Justice are not unceremoniously dispatched, after a hearing by a kangaroo court, read Parliamentary Select Committee, and political thugs deployed to hoot and shout vulgarities outside the official residence of the deposed CJ.
President Sirisena had good reasons to appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister, soon after his victory on January 8. To begin with, the UNP, it was, which, provided the overwhelming numbers that saw the Common Candidate through. Towards this end, the party made tremendous sacrifices, its members being subject to violence and even death. It has to be noted that the incumbent Prime Minister, at the time, was firmly with Rajapaksa, during the election campaign, together, with a majority of those in the SLFP, now holding ministerial office, in the Yahapalanaya government. The new President had promised to the people, groundbreaking reforms, including, clipping the wings of the Executive Presidency. He could not have made the changes, with a hostile parliament, that included the incumbent Prime Minister who owed his position to Mahinda Rajapaksa. He (President) would also have had the reasonable apprehension, that, with the two thirds majority at his command, there was the very real possibility of a coup of sorts engineered by Mahinda Rajapaksa to make himself Prime Minister, by a majority vote in parliament, in which eventuality, his (Presidents) victory would have come to naught. It was abundantly clear, to all, that President Sirisena could not afford to have a parliament that was against him, hanging like the sword of Damocleas, over his head. Hence, his decision to appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister, concurrently, with his own oath taking.
The same logic may also have been behind his decision to cut the grass from under the feet of Rajapaksa, at the subsequent general election. A UPFA victory, under MR, would have had the same effect, upsetting his reform plan, particularly, the changes to the constitution to achieve reconciliation.
Be that as it may, the so called crisis in the country, attributed to the PM, by Rajapaksa, is a crisis that is a deliberate creation of the JO, in furtherance of its political agenda. True, the petrol crisis placed tremendous hardships on the public, and, was something that could have been avoided. But, Rajapaksa should also recall that there was a near week long countrywide blackout in the early days of the Chandrika regime, of which he was a senior minister. As with that episode, the petroleum strike was something that was suddenly sprung on the country, for which, one can hardly blame the Prime Minister, like Chandrika was not to blame for the blackout. Besides, the economic crisis, which Rajapaksa may have been referring to, as the crisis, for which Premier Wickremesinghe is responsible, was, to a large extent, created by MR himself, by plunging the country into an eternal debt trap, and, pushing vital state institutions like our national carrier into a financial hellhole.
A good move
President Maithripala Sirisenas proposal for the declaration of a National Diabetes Month, to educate the public on measures to prevent the disease, through the proposed National Programme, is commendable, indeed, considering the rapid spread of this deadly Non-Communicable Disease, that has taken a heavy toll, on both, the old and young alike. Diabetes is a silent killer, more insidious than even cancer, in that the victim, for all intents and purposes, leads a normal life, on the surface, oblivious to the danger that lurks within him. Needless to say, the sedentary lives, led by most, have contributed to the disease, coupled with the rate race, that leaves no room for recreational activity and outdoor pursuits. Todays young are preoccupied with computers and electronic games, restricting their physical activity, while being addicted to fast food and sugar based products. The whole gamut of factors should be addressed when designing plans to combat the disease.

Music is their medicine
Music gives meaning to our memories. It makes us look at our memories differently and think differently about our memories. It makes us believe in ourselves. Music makes us imagine and that is the greatest quality about music. Melodies speaks to Lanthra Perera of the band Doctor on how music has found its way into their hearts and how they are compelled to share their music with their audiences.
When asked if there is a story about the mysterious name Doctor, Lanthra said that when they named the band it did not have a story as such, but later on they used the theme doctor in their concerts as part of their introductory act, where they used the sounds of sirens and dressed in white doctors cloaks.
Given my family back ground in music where my father was the first bassist in gypsies and having been born to a family involved in music, I've always been in the music scene. But I initially started taking music professionally was when I was about 16 years old.
Lanthra Perera
When speaking about my humble beginnings, I have a lot of fond memories of the amazing people that shaped me into what I am today. Starting from my father and then to my early days of rock music with the band Akash lead by Mr. Thilak Dias to forming a duo with Krishan up until today, to a full band, those are my memories, said Perera.
Music stirs passion within people. From the savage in the forest to Mozart and then to modern musicians such as Madonna, music has always awakened something within us. In that moment we are capable of anything.
Why it makes us passionate is a difficult question to answer, given that passion is not something you can reason out, hence it's that urge within you to be in it and how much you enjoy being in it. All of our band members have different stories on how we came into music. But I believe it is that urge that has drawn us all into the music scene out of a million other things we could have chosen instead, said Perera.
In terms of international artists the band greatly admire bands such as Maroon 5, Cold play and artistes such as Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars. As for local bands, they admire the Gypsies, Marians & Misty and artists such as Chitral Sompala and Sanuka Wickramasinghe
We do not emulate anyone, because we believe every individual is unique, so for that matter if we sing a song of Bruno Mars that'll be a Doctors version of that song, not an effort to emulate Bruno Mars.
We mostly do pop music. We do not have a theme that we have restricted ourselves to. When making music it eventually becomes something that is related and appealing to the younger crowd. All these themes are close to our hearts, but we always try to bring variety based on the crowd we are catering to in live performances, explained Perera.
The band has released six originals and an album is still underway
I believe being successful has a few ingredients that is common to all despite what industry you are in. They are simply hard work, passion for what you do, prioritization, humbleness and continuous improvement.
Specifically in the music industry today music is the global language, hence we cannot isolate ourselves to one particular genre of music such as local music. Therefore my message is to keep yourselves updated and learn the new trends and technologies that keep coming, pointed out Perera.
Doctors secret to success is dedication, desire and discipline. They are a committed band and they care about their audience. Music is their medicine. And music can heal.
It's pure dedication and team work and a mix of all this and all the good deeds that follow that have made us successful. To come to where we are today, it has taken hours of practice sessions and also on the job training. The more we perform and the more experience we gather, it gives us the ability to better read the crowd at every event. The rest follows like a ritual where the songs just flow in as we sync in with the audience, added Perera.
There are a lot of clich terms about music such as music inspires and music soothes the soul. Everything under the sun that has been said about music has been said. For the band Doctor, music is basically the meaning of their name. They are healers who heal through their music.
Nothing is hidden, usually our music is quite straight forward and we always try to convey a message that is close to our heart. We are looking forward to celebrate the 10 years of Doctor next year and few plans are in progress for that. We are working on another original too. If you speak of the long term, it'll be forever to make great music and entertain the audiences locally and internationally, said Perera.

Not welcomed in Hollywood
Though Irrfan Khan, who will soon be seen in 'Qarib Qarib Singlle', has become Bollywood's most celebrated import to the West over the years, there was a time when, by his own admission, he "wasn't really welcomed as far as Hollywood is concerned".
He recalls, "Most of the times, I got the vibe ki wahaan toh kar liya hai, yahaan kar ke dikha. It was only the audience that felt proud and exuberant."However, the actor's desire and perseverance kept him in good stead. "I was willing to sacrifice anything for good work, even if it meant exploring opportunities in another industry and not just Hollywood.
I was looking for engaging work and I sacrificed a lot at that time.
Even today, I lose out on so much work here when I assign my dates to a Hollywood project. But I would do it over and over as no amount of money or fame can match that experience," he says, adding, "When Ang Lee demands certain things from you, aapki phatt jaati hai. You have to dig within to find resources in order to play the character.
The experience recharges my batteries and gives me a new outlook because I deal with a story in a different way. You are in alignment with the director and such challenges are mandatory for an actor."

NWP-PC allocates Rs. 23 mn for dengue eradication
A sum of Rs. 23 million has been allocated by the North Western Provincial Council (NWP-PC) to wipe out dengue mosquitoes from the NWP within the next few weeks.
Accordingly, NWP Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake has currently deployed 400 family health nurses and 75 PHIs to educate the school community of the NWP on dengue eradication, with effect from November 13.
Many parents and residents of both Kurunegala and Puttalam districts have presently complained to the Education Ministry that many school premises, government offices premises and business premises contain mosquito breeding grounds and that is why the dengue fever cannot be eradicated in and around the NWP.
It has been found that certain school heads still dont take any positive steps in eradicating mosquito-breeding grounds within their own school premises and hence, students and teachers of such schools continue to become victims of dengue fever.
This is an unpardonable offence on the part of the school heads, Kurunegala Senior Education Director W. M. Balasooriya, speaking at a meeting of school principals of the Kurunegala district held at Youth Training Centre in Bingiriya, Kurunegala on Sunday.
Taking this plight into account, Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has decided to issue instructions to Provincial and Zonal Education Directors to take steps to file Courts cases against such irresponsible and errant school principals and to impose fines on them. This decision has been taken by the Education Ministry to save both students and teachers of the country from dengue fever, which is now spreading fast in and around all provinces.
Education Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi has already been instructed by Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam in this regard, he added.

Ethnic issue should be resolved fast
The ethnic issue has to be resolved fast, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday said.
He was participating in the Committee Stage Debate on the budget 2018 proposals.
The Minister said an Indian newspaper has stated that the Sri Lankan three decade conflict cost the country USD 400 and the government incurred half of the sum.
The Minister said the actual damage on the Sri Lankan Economy was not yet estimated.
I have directed the matter to the Parliamentary Research Unit, and they will prepare the estimate in future, Minister Kirella said.
He said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was able to end the war, but he could not develop the economy, bring in investments and start enterprises.
He said Mahinda Rajapaksa , however, got massive loans.
The Minister said Sri Lanka had a surplus budget when it achieved independence, but today, the country is caught in a Rs. 7,000 billion debt trap. He said all previous government were responsible for this situation.
After decades, this government was able to record an increase in the state revenue, Minister Kiriella said. The 11.5 percent revenue in 2014 has increased to 14.2 percent in 2016, he said.
He said the poverty head count index was 6.7 in 2012 and 2013, it was reduced to 4.1 in 2016.
The Minister said the construction sector earns 8 percent of the GDP. He said express ways, and other roads are in progress at the same rate and it will continue.
He said the new budget is focused on enterprises and youth and the budget 2018 includes more proposals to develop the business sector.
Budget proposals open country to world: Amaraweera
The Finance Minister in his maiden budget has presented proposals that would create more jobs and open the country to the world thereby taking it forward, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was participating in the committee stage debate on the budget 2018 proposals.
Generally, the Opposition condemn the budget. If a budget is good, instead of praising it, the Opposition say it is a fantasy budget. The Finance Minister has managed to come up with a budget that almost everyone approves.He has a good understanding of parties in the government. I believe that he has taken the good proposals of both parties and included them in the budget proposals, he said.
Currently, the shipping industry allows only around 40 percent foreign companies, while 60 percent is handled by local companies. A proposal was made in the budget to open the shipping industry completely. I suggest that a proper mechanism has to be devised to develop the shipping sector whilst protecting the local shipping industry, he said.
He said the public was of the view that telephone charges would increase due to the proposed taxes on transmission towers. The Finance Minister has clarified that the tax will certainly not be passed onto the consumers and there would not be an increase in telephone charges.
The tax imposed on banks will also have no impact on the general public, he said.
Amaraweera said no foreigner or foreign company would be allowed to purchase lands at its will unless it creates employment opportunities and benefits the country. He said this had been discussed and clarified. Only if such ventures benefit the country, will the government provide tax concessions to foreign entities. During the past, foreigners were allowed to purchase lands at will and we lost a great extent of coastal lands as a result. Now it is not the case. Such projects will only be approved subsequent to the Cabinet approval after extensive discussions.
He pointed out that the budget had allocated funds to develop several sectors of the fisheries sector. He said the country has 116 undeveloped lagoons that offer great fishing resources. He said Rs. 1,000 million has been allocated as an initial step to develop 10 lagoons. There is great export potential for fish. By developing these lagoons, we can generate foreign income. To encourage the fishing industry and for it to introduce new technology, the budget includes concessions of 50 percent of the cost to manufacture boats over 55 feet in length. Proper fish storing facilities will also be provided. Fifty percent of the cost of upgrading storage facilities on fishing boats is also provided to further develop the industry, Amaraweera said.
Importance of obtaining 50,000 houses highlighted :
Northern politicians should come to one stand
Northern politicians should come to one stand to get 50,000 houses for the displaced people at this important juncture, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday said.
Minister Silva was participating in the Committee Stage debate on the budget proposals.
He said the government had funds to construct those houses during the last two years but the politicians could not come to one stand over the houses.
They, at least this year, should come to one decision to get the houses for the innocent people, he said.
He said the country had to face last year many challenges including drought and floods. We, however, could increase the export income by 7 percent and tourism industry by 3 percent. The tax income has increased by 12.3 percent. He said the garment export income has dropped by 3 percent.
The capital expenditure for 2017 was Rs. 633 billion, while the proposed expenditure for 2018 is Rs. 761 billion, Minister Silva said. This is a 20 percent increase, he said.
The Minister said the country has to pay Rs. 1,150 billion this year for loans.
The estimated total earnings is Rs. 2,326 billion and this is not enough for the expenditure and pay the loan premiums, Minister Silva said. So we have to borrow another Rs. 1,895 billion. As a result, we increase our loans by another Rs. 745 billion.
Can we get out of this trap he asked.
The proposals, however, are designed to develop the country. Rs. 2,677 million was allocated to construct houses for the Estate sector, Rs. 6,000 million to construct houses in rural areas, Rs. 17,500 million to construct urban houses and Rs. 2,800 million to construct houses for those affected by the landslides while constructing 50,000 houses for those IDPs in North, he said.
The Minister said allocations were made during the last two years but could not realise the targets due to the tug-of-war among the politicians in North.
The Minister said Rs. 1,674 million was allocated to develop the human resource in the health sector.
COPA third report:
One third of 842 state institutions neglected financial guidelines
The COPA report tabled in Parliament yesterday indicated that nearly one third of total government institutions out of 842 investigated by the Committee have shown poor compliance with the state financial and performance guidelines.
The third report of the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) was presented to Parliament yesterday by its Chairman and Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna.
Findings pertaining to all the 842 institutions coming under the scope of COPA are presented today. From 1978, 31 COPA reports were presented to Parliament. Of them, only 410 institutions were called to Parliament. All these state institutions have been evaluated annually, he told the House presenting the report.
The report observes that only 67.57 percent of public institutions were able to adhere to financial and performance guidelines. Only seven percent pf them were able to adhere to 90 percent of guidelines in their financial transactions.
The total number of institutions that had achieved a compliance of less than 60 percent was 240. It is approximately 29 percent of the 842 institutions.
Twenty eight ministries and 61 departments have not properly maintained the fixed assets registry.
The committee would take action to recognise the institutions that failed to achieve high performance level and inform their chief accounting officers of the shortcomings and hold them responsible for the subject areas to be developed.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya thanking the Committee said the Finance Minister would take measures to carry out future investigations and take appropriate measures.
The Auditor Generals Department, Prime Ministers Office and Elections Department were among the institutions that received gold medals for high performance level in 2015.
Concessions given for beer sale will harm youth: Rajitha
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the concessions given for the sale of beer in the budget 2018 proposals would encourage youngsters to consume alcohol and it could create social and health issues.
Joining the Committee stage debate on the budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday, Minister Senaratne said the statistics given to the Finance Minister that 49 percent of alcohol users consume illegally brewed alcohol has no grounds.
The NATA has commenced an investigation to get the proper statistics and it will complete soon. In 1990, the same proposal was brought to provide concessions for beer. According to data we have gathered from the Police, Excise Department and Divisional Secretariats, the consumption of illegal alcohol has reduced. The actual number of persons who consume illegally brewed alcohol is only between 2.5 percent and 6 percent, not 49 percent, Senaratne said.
He said the Finance Minister had compared the European countries to Sri Lanka, but this comparison could not be made as beer consumption in the West is basically a part of their culture and food habits. He said that in Sri Lanka and other Asian countries, people consume alcohol to get a high or to reach a level of intoxication.
He said the Health Ministry together with the World Health Organisation had carried out a survey and concluded that 35 percent of males over 15 years of age consume alcohol, but only 1 percent females. According to the statistics, the percentage of alcohol drinkers from the population is less than 20 percent. Of that, only around 6 percent consume illegally manufactured brew.
Therefore, making beer more affordable could entice youngsters to try out beer. It would encourage them to move onto hard liquor later, he warned.
According to the Health Minister, accidents kill 9,000 annually and disable around 49,000. Alcohol consumption is a leading cause for these accidents. Encouraging the consumption of beer would not deter people from illegally brewed alcohol consumption; it would instead create many other issues, he said.
Budget lacks proposals to bridge deficit: Anandan
This budget 2018 has no proposals to bridge the deficit, Tamil National Alliance MP Shivashakthi Anandan said in Parliament yesterday.
He said the budget has proposals to provide reliefs and welfare for the people, but they were not clearly pointed out. It is a piece of paper because of this reason, he said.
He was participating in the second reading debate on the budget 2018 proposals. The parliamentarian said the developments that are promised to North are only in reports. Therefore, the TNA that supported the government at elections cannot face the voters. He complained that the TNA is attempting to revenge the voters who stood against them.
None of the pledges given to the people in North have not been kept, he said.
Budget 2018 has nothing new: Bimal
This government is going on the same path like the all previous governments took and this budget is no different except for a few changes in terms of the environment, JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake said.
He was participating in the committee stage debate on the budget 2018 proposals.
Of the 7,000 million world population, 3,000 million are categorised as poor or those under the poverty line. Of the US population, 14.3 percent are poor and in Europe, one in every four is said to be poor. As Minister Kiriella said, Sri Lankas poverty is at 4.6 percent. Therefore, one can determine how wrong our statistics are. In 2016 May, the Prime Minister said 43 percent in Sri Lanka earn less than $ 2 per day, around 20 million. The daily income of 9 million people is less than Rs. 300, according to the Prime Minister. He said the figures just a year ago. Then Minister Kiriella claims its 4.6 percent, he said.
Rathnayake said the Uva Province has more poor people than the war-affected North has. Who has caused more harm to the people, is it the LTTE or the Sri Lankan Government The richest district in terms of gems is Ratnapura. Yet it is among the poorest five districts in the country. Most are of the view that the North is the poorest, but other districts are, he said. Even the government MPs tell us in private that even they cannot provide jobs to the people. Some told us they could only provide 16 jobs for the last three years. The government cannot even provide private sector employment. The youth unemployment rate is at 22 percent, he said.
We will not be able to reach the goals we desire even though the government has good intentions because we are heading along the unsuccessful path followed over the past 70 years. There is no country that has reached success based on foreign investment. The blue-green budget is like painting a car externally without changing its old engine. The FDI has increased, but it did not improve countrys economy, he said.
Dineshs adjournment motion today
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena is scheduled to move an adjournment motion for the debate in the evening today on a recent debate on Sri Lankas conflict at the House of Lords in Britain.
The motion to be moved has already been handed over to the Speakers office with copies to the office of the Secretary General of Parliament.
According to parliamentary sources, the motion says the Sri Lankan Government should take the matter raised in the House of the Lords and follow it up.
The sources say the motion says that since Lord Naseby while addressing Britains House of Lords, drew attention that the casualty figures for the last period of the civil conflict in Sri Lanka, which ended in May 2009, cited in the United Nations Darusman Report, were brought into question by the figures quoted by former UN spokesman Gordon Weiss, by former US Ambassador Blake, in the report by the UKs Major General Holmes, and finally, by the heavily-redacted communications from the UKs Lieutenant Colonel Anton Gash released to him by the British Government.
Since he further stated that the UK must recognise that this was a war against terrorism, so the rules of engagement are based on international humanitarian law, not the European Convention on Human Rights and that the West, and in particular the US and the UK, must remove the threat of war crimes and foreign judges that overhangs and overshadows all Sri Lankans, especially their leaders. The Government of Sri Lanka should take action to pursue this matter with the Britains Foreign and Commonwealth Office and with the UN Human Rights Commission to change their unjust positions regarding Sri Lanka and thereby remove the threat to this country, to its defence forces, and to its leaders, and that the Government should also report back to Parliament on this matter, the motion says, according to the sources.

Speaker should annul Constitutional Assembly: Rajapakshe
United National Party Parliamentarian Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in writing to annul the motion passed in Parliament to set up a constitutional assembly to prepare a new constitution.
MP Rajapakshe wrote to the Speaker that the conduct and process of the Constitutional Assembly was against the Constitution. He said the Speaker was partially responsible for allowing Parliament to engage in an anti-constitutional act. He said in his letter that it was the duty of the Speaker to correct the error.
He said that the Constitutional Assembly is an illegal institution. The assemblys process would create a constitutional crisis in the country, the letter said.
The Constitution outlines a clear procedure to be followed if there is a need to amend the Constitution or bring about a new constitution, MP Rajapakshe wrote. Deliberately violating that process would amount to callous disregard to the Janatha Paramadipathya or ultimate power of the people. The process initiated by the government is strangulating the democracy and is creating an anarchy in the country.
He said in his letter the interim report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly contains proposals to divide the country and they violated the Constitution. He said the decision made by the MPs including himself to set up a constitutional assembly should be considered a wrong decision made with good intentions, so the Speaker should annul it.
He calls on the Speaker to declare the Steering Committee report and the Constitutional Assembly null and void. He said no condition prevails in the country conducive to prepare a new constitution and incumbent parliament is not suitable for the task.
Parliament is engaged in an anti-constitutional task and therefore an illegal process, he wrote. If the Speaker fails to rectify the error immediately, he should take the full responsibility of the situation being brewing in the country with protests and public displeasure against the new constitution.
Parliamentary sources said the letter dated yesterday has been handed over to the Speakers office on the same day. According to the sources, copies of the letter were sent to the President, Prime Minister, Opposition Leader and party leaders in Parliament.

Pathfinder Foundation to develop work  programme with Sichuan University of China
Following a fact-finding tour undertaken by a team of academics representing the prestigious Sichuan University (SCU) in April at the invitation of the Pathfinder Foundation (PF), a three-member PF delegation visited SCU recently with a view to exploring avenues for cooperation with that university.
The PF delegation comprised Bernard Goonetilleke (Chairman), Luxman Siriwardena (Executive Director) and Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage, Director Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives (CILI) of the Pathfinder Foundation.
Sichuan University is recognized as one of the 10 top universities in China. The university located in Chengdu, capital of the Sichuan Province, is home to app 16 million people.
SCU boasts of three campuses, oldest being the Wanjian campus. The Huaxi Campus, located in the city centre, is home to the medical school of the university, which could be of interest to Sri Lankan students aspiring to follow medicine. The Jinagan Campus, constructed in 2003, is in the Shuangliu County, which is about 12 km from other campuses.
SCU was the result of gradual merger between the oldest higher education institution in China  also known as Sichuan University  Chengdu University of Science and Technology and what was earlier a private West China Union University. The history of the university could be traced back to 1896, and it is one of Chinas national universities functioning directly under the Ministry of Education.
SCU conducts over 500 degree programs, through its 31 faculties covering a wide range of fields. Subjects offered at the Sichuan University cover a broad field, including Business and Economics, Life Sciences, Arts and Humanities, Engineering and Technology, Physical Science, Computer Science, Social Sciences, Clinical, Pre-clinical and Health. With individual departments covering such an array of subjects, the university has attracted over 60,000 graduates and post-graduate students and has a total staff of over 11,000, among whom over 1,300 are professors and 2,345 associate professors.
The university maintains a strong partnership and exchanges with universities in Europe and the US. As such, steps taken by the Pathfinder Foundation to establish relations with SCU and Sri Lankan higher education institutions are bound to bring good dividends to Sri Lankan students, who are in perennial search for cost effective tertiary education in selected disciplines.
During the visit of SCU academic team headed by Prof. Ming Hong to Sri Lanka last April, the Pathfinder Foundation engaged in discussions to determine how that university could forge close relations with Sri Lankan universities as well. Following the discussions with the Pathfinder delegation, the SCU and PF are negotiating to enter in to a MoU for joint academic programmes in association with SCU.
One of the highlights of the visit was the conferment of Guest Professorship of SCU to Adm. Dr. Colombage by the President of SCU, handed over to him by Prof. Yan Shijin, Vice President of SCU. Following the award, Prof. Colombage delivered a lecture on Changing Dynamics in the Indian Ocean: Geo-Strategic Competition and Dilemma of Sri Lanka.
During the discussion Vice President Prof. Yan Shijin had with the visiting Pathfinder team, he emphasized the importance of heightening China-Sri Lanka relations and Sri Lankas role in the Belt and Road Initiative of Chinese President Xi Jingping and the desire of SCU to help Sri Lankan students seeking higher education in China.
PF Chairman Bernard Goonetilleke expressed appreciation of PF for the interest of SCU in forging relations with Sri Lanka in the academic field and extended an invitation to Vice President Prof. Yan to visit Sri Lanka at a mutually convenient time, which was accepted by him. The intended joint activities between Pathfinder Foundation and the Sichuan University would be a harbinger for increased cooperation between China and Sri Lanka.

Pathfinder participate in seventh Intl Conference on Common Development of China, Indian Ocean Economics
Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage, Director Pathfinder Foundation said that the Indian Ocean Region is a region of Strategic Competition, Strategic Alliances for some major powers against others and Strategic Dilemma for smaller and less powerful states for major powers. Admiral was making these comments at the 7th International Conference on Common Development of China and Indian Ocean Economics, organized by the Research Institute for Indian Ocean Economics (RIIO) at Yunnna University of Finance and Economics (YUFE) held in Kunming, China.
Delivering the keynote address titled Great Power strategy and its Regional Role in the Indian Ocean: From the perspective of Security, Admiral said that the Indian Ocean region is presently an area of a developing maritime Cold war where major powers contest for power and influence and an area of trust deficiency. This situation has led to an increased militarization and nuclearization of the Indian Ocean.
RIIO founded by Yunnan University of Finance and Economics is an independent academic institute. RIIO under the leadership of Professor Zhu Cuiping is committed to its International, academic and strategic purposes, combining academic research with advisory services, and to strategic and policy studies of theories for the future of Indian Ocean Region. RIIO attach great importance to exchange and cooperation with institutes in China and abroad in related fields. It organizes regular international symposiums and publicize research achievements and information of research activities for governments, enterprises and public through academic thesis, research reports, newsletters, journals and blue books. RIIO is working to make contributions to the development of China and the Indian Ocean Region and also provide intellectual support to governments and enterprises.
The 7th International conference was conducted with the participation of academics, subject matter experts and representatives of think tanks and governments for two days in the Sprint City of China Kunming. Countries participated at this conference are Australia, China, India, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage of Pathfinder foundation and Additional Secretary to Sri Lanka Ministry of Foreign affairs, Sumith Nakandala represented Sri Lanka in the key event.
During the Indian Ocean conference held in Colombo on September 1, 2017, the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka highlighted the need for and Indian Ocean Order, which is not dominated by one single state. Moreover, he went on to stress that thus Indian Ocean order should emphasize freedom of navigation and overflight, peaceful resolution of disputes and decision making through consensus. The Indian Ocean cannot be an open ocean for some states and a close ocean for others. This is a global common and hence should be accessible for all states for peaceful purposes. Sri Lanka situated in a geographically advantages position and having a balanced and equi-distanced foreign policy could play a catalyst role in moving ahead with a this new Indian Ocean Order for maintaining stability, security of seaborne commerce and freedom in the Indian Ocean Region.

PM reveals: SriLankan debt, a staggering USD 740 M
 USD 400 m taken from state banks
 Parliament kept in the dark
 Waste in the past ran into trillions of rupees
The debt burden of SriLankan Airlines stood at a whopping USD 740 million as at last week, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister made this comment highlighting the extent of financial mismanagement during the previous administration.
He was speaking at the National Awards Ceremony organised by the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) to recognise the State Institutions with a high level of performance, held at the Parliament Complex yesterday.
One among the senior public officials in the gathering reacted to the PMs remark on SriLankan Airlines with a vernacular exclamation of surprise.
The Premier overhearing it said his first reaction to the staggering amount of SriLankan Airlines debt was also the same.
Our Treasury Secretary too expressed his shock. Out of the total debt of SriLankan Airlines, USD 400 million has been taken from two state banks and by issuing bonds, the Prime Minister said.
There has been no financial control in the country during the previous reign.
Parliament completely overlooked the accounts over the last decade or so. Parliament was in the dark over state revenue and expenditure. In 2013, the revenue was not enough even to pay the debt. Payments three times more than the actual value had been paid for some projects. Now we have restored financial control of Parliament. The Budget Office will be set up shortly after the new building is occupied. We promote efficiency, productivity and value for money in state institutions next two years, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister also expressed his determination to pay off the massive debt accumulated on SriLankan Airlines and the Ports without passing it on to the next generation.
Let us deal with our sins without leaving them for another generation, the Premier commented.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the Finance Ministry assured him that a mechanism would be in place from January next year to take follow up action with regard to the COPA reports.
The waste of money over the past years runs into trillions of rupees. Had we utilised this money in a prudent manner, the living standards of our people could have been much better today, the Speaker added. (Reported by Sandasen Marasinghe, Camelia Nathaniel and Disna Mudalige)

Podujana Peramuna rally overcast by unruly crowd
The maiden election rally of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna was held at Salgado grounds in Anuradhapura under the patronage of Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and the participation of parliamentarians belonging to the Joint Opposition group, on November 12 afternoon.
People attending the rally, brought from all parts of the country in about 470 buses and lorries, created ugly scenes in the Anuradhapura city shouting and casting obscene remarks to passers-by. The unruly behaviour of most people brought for the rally were captured by some of the photographers who covered the event.
One Rajapaksa loyalist fallen in front of the War Hero Memorial in Anuradhapura after taking one too many, was seen muttering filth while another intoxicated youth was seen fast asleep on the ground, oblivious to the goings on in the rally.
Shortly before the rally started, there was a mini battle between a group of women and a group of men, with the women beating men with umbrellas until they were broken.
An ambulance carrying a critical patient from a rural hospital to the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital was held up on the main road opposite the Salgado grounds.

## Title: Preventing a heart attack in a patient with diabetes

Preventing a heart attack in a patient with diabetes
Novemeber 14th has been designated as World Diabetes Day to commemorate the birth anniversary of Sir Fredrick Banting, the discoverer of the life saving anti-diabetic agent insulin.
This topic has been selected since most deaths from diabetes occur due to heart disease and in a country such as ours it appears as though its incidence is increasing. This is in spite of the presence of very capable medical consultants and availability of modern technology. The increasing trend could be attributed partly due to the indifference of some medical officers as well as the patients. The term C linical Inertia has been attributed to this condition. However, in the case of more developed countries such as the United States, inspite of an increasing incidence of diabetes and obesity (over-weightiness), the death rate from heart disease is in fact decreasing.
Let me start with a true incident. A 55 year old trader was admitted to the hospital with a severe heart disease. His life could not be saved and the postmortem showed evidence of a massive heart attack. It was found that in spite of the presence of diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol for several years, he has been not screened for coexistent heart disease. The purpose of this letter is mainly to educate concerned people to undertake sufficient measures to prevent such unfortunate deaths.
Diabetes could affect the heart mainly by clogging the blood vessels supplying the heart (called coronary arteries), or less frequently by affecting the heart muscle directly (cardiomyopathy), or the nerves which supply the heart. The following discussion would be confined to coronary artery disease which accounts for nearly 95% of diabetic patients with involvement of the heart. Clinically, diabetic heart disease could manifest as a heart attack, angina (pain in chest on exertion), palpitations or even heart failure.
In the prevention of heart disease, one should be aware of the contributory causes. This includes accompanying high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high sugar in the order of importance. Contrary to popular belief, it is not the blood sugar alone that causes heart attacks but the other two factors too mentioned above. In fact, it is observed that sometimes those with very high blood sugar values are spared of a heart attack since their blood pressure and cholesterol are normal. In contrast, sometimes those with marginally elevated blood sugar levels would sustain an attack since their blood pressure or cholesterol or both are high. There are other factors such as smoking, the presence of a family history of heart disease, protein in the urine and even infections for example of the gums in the mouth (periodontitis) too that could contribute. Thus, in the prevention of heart disease all these factors need to be addressed adequately. This is called secondary prevention in contrast to tertiary prevention which means the steps that one should adopt in preventing the progress of heart disease in those who are already affected.
The next problem is how to recognize heart disease in who do not manifest typical symptoms such as chest pain. It could occur for example with a sudden onset of difficulty in breathing, a typical chest pain or unconsciousness. In fact, it could also occur without any symptoms except for a faint or uneasiness and is called a silent heart attack which is supposed to account for nearly 30% of all the episodes.
How does one screen both these categories of patients: both with or without symptoms There exists what are called risk calculators mainly for those in developed countries. Certain data are fed into the risk calculator. It then automatically calculates the 10 year risk of a heart attack or death. If it is less than 10%, further screening is not needed. However, the author has some reservations with the use of these calculators since in some of these risk calculators important criteria such as a family history, central obesity (high waist circumference) are not considered. He routinely screens diabetic patients with heart disease if it is more than 5 years of duration or even if it is less than 5 years with one or more risk factors which includes family history, presence of gum disease, protein in the urine and central obesity.
What are the investigations that are available The basic tests are Echocardiography and a stress test that are mostly available in hospitals where there are cardiologists. These tests may provide some information to carry out more tests. The Gold Standard for measuring the blood flow to the heart is Angiography where a dye is injected to visualize the patency of coronary vessels. This test too is not without risk and in those who are worried about it, more sophisticated tests which, even though not as sensitive as conventional angiography would be of some use. These include CT coronary angiography and radioactive scanning called thallium scanning (also called pharmacological stress test) meant for those who are unable to carry out the conventional stress test due to the presence of arthritis of the knees, obesity or bronchial asthma. If these tests are used judiciously so many lives could be saved. Unfortunately, most of these more sophisticated tests are confined to Colombo and it is a pity that they are not available even in the other major cities of the country. Those who could afford, somehow get them done in Colombo but what about the poor villagers where diabetes is spreading fairly rapidly

## Title: Protection Methodology for  Sri Lankan industrial sector
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Finance
## Date: Tuesday, November 14, 2017 - 01:00
Protection Methodology for  Sri Lankan industrial sector
Sri Lankan industrial policy is mainly centered around the private sector. Many Sri Lankan industries are in existence for over 40 years while the others blossomed after 1977 after the country adopted the open economy principles. Local industries are in the forefront of the local supply chain for a long period of time for both consumer and capital goods. Popular brands are household names. Maliban, Munchee, Sisil, Keells, Cargills, Hayleys, Singer, Uswatte, Kist, Hemas, Finco, ACL, Raigam, KML, Siddhaleepa, Orange, Maharaja, KG, Watawala, Atlas, Nikado, American Premium, MD, Highland, Astra, Link and many other branded products will vouch for the consumer preferences for their products over the imported goods. Our manufacturers have successfully entered the export markets as well during the last few decades.
To ensure the successful continuation of these industries, the setting up of a Fortune 300 Sri Lankan industrial umbrella could be the ideal tonic to feed our local consumers as well as to ensure good products at competitive prices for the overseas customers. The 300 entities would represent different industries. Later on, the umbrella could be extended to 500 companies to represent major companies in the local and export markets. All ventures in the umbrella will benefit from sharing of research work, synergy effects and formation of strong cartels.
The selections could be based on the following criteria:
1. Quantum of annual net forex earnings.
2. Strength of work force.
3. Number of years in existence in Sri Lanka.
4. Local and overseas market shares.
5. Financial stability.
6. Measures of good governance policies adopted.
7. Technological strength.
8. Staff benefits and average annual remuneration.
9. Green environmental standards.
10. Annual Tax revenue to the state coffers.
11. CSR initiatives (past, present and future).
Once the Fortune 300 umbrella is formed, strengthening of ventures in the umbrella could take place with state and overseas assistance to ensure the steady growth and going concern status of the members in the umbrella. The immediate beneficiaries would be the state with higher GDP growth levels coupled with additional taxes and the local consumer with price stability and higher quality products. The relevant chambers should take the lead in establishing the Fortune 300 enterprises to achieve their vision and long term objectives by way of value addition to the selected enterprises. The purchasing power of the people would improve and level of public savings will rise paving the way for a higher standard of living.
Most of the local industrial business ventures are not quoted in the Colombo stock exchange. Encouragement should be provided to them to list in the bourse and reap multiple benefits. Some of the stable manufacturing concerns in our country hails from the British era and have reached great standards. They too are contributing lavishly to the state revenue by way of taxes and meeting the needs of the local and overseas markets. Fortification of all these industries is also important if we are to reach niche markets overseas.
The most prominent state agencies which could assist the rapid industrialization of our country are the Inland Revenue, Customs, Excise, Provincial/Municipal/urban councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas and of course the Board of Investment. The inland revenue, customs and excise department are involved with designing tax laws and collection of taxes. These institutions should always design their revenue earning measures in the most prudent manner to ensure the continuity of local/export markets through the local industrialists. The provincial/municipal/urban councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas should assist our industrial sector by granting prompt approvals and assistance whenever needed and also protecting the industries located in their respective areas by ensuring the non intervention by area politicians in a unlawful manner. They should also improve the infrastructure of their areas to assist the industrial concerns to ensure a smooth work flow without any temporary interruptions even.
The board of investment carries big responsibility on their shoulders to thwart foreign investors coming over here to compete with local industries for the local market. The foreign investors should be welcomed to invest in production of goods & services only for exports, especially for hit hereto untapped foreign markets ideally with latest technology and greener production methods. They should never be allowed to pose a threat to out industrial and agricultural industries. In 1978,the then government started the FIAC (foreign investment advisory commission) mainly to spearhead the foreign direct investment drive of Sri Lanka. A number of Free trade zones were established to woo the foreign investors. With the success of the Katunayake and Biyagama investment zones, the government established the more formalized Board of Investment. Over the years the BOI reached great heights and established more investment zones in various parts of the country. The investor flow continued even after the 1983 civil disturbances and subsequent escalation of violence in North and East. A vast number of Sri Lankans found employment in BOI enterprises set up by foreign investors. The carried out extensive promotion campaigns overseas with the assistance of our diplomatic missions abroad. However, the existing BOI legislation be subject to review in the best interests of the local industrialists and the already established BOI ventures in Sri Lanka whilst maintaining the investor friendly attitude and status to woo sizable new foreign direct investments. BOI should also take some credit for creating foreign employment to our youth especially in South Korea through its association with the Korean investor community in Sri Lanka. In 1994 MAY, The BOI took an eight member trade delegation along with the Prime Minister to Seoul to woo Korean investments and also to create employment opportunities for our youth in South Korea. The writer of this article was one of the consultants and a member of the 8 member trade delegation which included chairmen of a number of blue chip companies in Sri Lanka including JKH and Aitken Spence. We had lengthy discussions and presentations at KDI (Korea Development Institute) to secure investments and employment avenues for youth.
At present the BOI grants approval for new projects under two categories, i.e. section 16 and 17. Section 17 carries a number of concessions while the Section 16 investors will be subject to the normal laws prevailing in the country like any other business. Of late a number of foreign investors especially from SAARC countries have expressed their desire to set up manufacturing plants in Sri Lanka for the local market and also to import goods from overseas and engage in import trading activities. Their investment in the project is not at all sufficient to stake a claim as a worthy foreign investor. The exchange controller has issued a gazette notification in April 2002 to permit foreign investors to engage in retail trading (import and sell in local market) provided the foreign investor remits us$ 1 million to Sri Lanka for such purpose. This gazette was issued in 2002 over 15 years back before the end of hostilities in North and East. However, when one weigh in the factors like end of north/east war, improved infrastructure such as roads, logistics. this gazette be revised to permit foreign investors to set up manufacturing plants only for export purposes with a minimum investment of at least us$ 3 million and should do away with the import trade activities completely for the protection of local industrial sector. This is in the wake of our GSP plus status, uplifting of ban by European union for our fish/fishery products, new seaport and an airport in the South. For very paltry sums of foreign investment, we should not place our local industries under pressure and totally wipe off them in the future. We should redesign a clear cut policy to assist the local industries on a continuous basis.
Some salient factors towards this cause are tabulated below.
1. Investors especially from SAARC and African countries bring in relatively lower quantums of forex for their investment to set up a base here and engage in unlawful activities and send out large quantums of forex out of the country much more than their investment in a shorter period of time.
2. They will overvalue their plant and machinery and procure enhanced bank loans/facilities.
3. They will adopt fraudulent means to avoid local taxes
4. They may not pay statutory payments such as EPF and ETF for staff or at least delay same.
5. They will wind up business in Sri Lanka after recovering many times of their investment leaving huge liabilities to banks, unpaid salaries, local taxes, benefits and compensation to staff.
6. They will try to keep a substantial portion of foreign exchange overseas by inflated import values and depleted export values.
7. By the time they depart, a number of local industrial concerns may well have collapsed making a large number unemployed.
8. They will also try to bring in a large number of foreign workers for their industry. This will pose social and health issues for the whole country.
9. The export prices of our exporters may well fall, due to the low prices quoted by these new foreign investors for same markets in same countries.
10. The foreign investors will park their profits abroad creating an adverse forex situation for Sri Lanka.
11. After a few months they will discontinue with manufacturing and only engage in import trading totally wiping off the respective industries in Sri Lanka.
12. After wiping off the local industrial sector they will jack up the prices. The local consumers will have to pay very high prices for imported goods coupled with higher exchange rates due to rupee depreciation.
13. The trade deficit of the country will further go up due to high dollar demand for imported goods.
14. Our local industries will wind up business in Sri Lanka and invest in countries like Bangladesh. Bangladesh has already invited the Sri Lankan business community to set up business in their country.
Considering the adverse effects mentioned above, the BOI should suitably amend their existing laws in consultation with the chambers of commerce in Sri Lanka to protect the local industries and the local consumers. Considering the current plight of our industrial concerns and exporters, the following six pronged support scheme should be immediately implemented by the state.
1. A bank borrowing interest rate of 5% per annum for capacity expansion, product range expansion for export markets for generation of net forex earning of not less than us$ 350,000 additionally per year during the tenure of the loan or for creation of additional 100 job opportunities locally for above purposes. Approval of business loans/facilities for above purpose should be within 5 working days
2. Reduction of vat/other tax rates for all locally produced goods for local markets, back to a realistic level. This will boost turnover of local manufacturers.
3. Protection measures from BOI for long term existence.
4. Cutting off of red tape of local authorities and other state agencies.
5. Capital allowance rate of 33 1/3% on new plant & machinery for tax purposes.
No government can solve the burning social and economic problems of the country alone. They need the support of the industrial sector for employment creation, export forex earnings, to raise tax revenue, to bring down cost of living. The government should go hand in hand with the industrial sector to achieve its economic and other goals. Sadly, most governments have neglected this and allowed the industrial sector to weather all storms alone while raising taxes at adhoc times to raise revenue. Industrial growth rates are vital for steady GDP growth rates of a country. There are many state industrial ventures also which could be revived with local private sector assistance easily. We do not need any foreign investors to make such ventures viable. Over the years, successive governments put their political supporters vastly in excess of manpower needs for such ventures. Successive governments never sought the assistance of the private sector to manage such enterprises, fearing the loss of jobs for their political supporters. The treasury has been pumping large sums of money to meet the losses of such ventures through tax payer money.
I wish to point out a few remedial measures for a financially weaker company in any industry as given below.
1. Merge with a stronger company.
2. Obtain synergy effects from other companies in the industry.
3. Inviting strategic partners from overseas with a capital infusion to promote exports.
4. Restructure all existing loans for a longer period of time.
5. Reaching agreement with workers for a lower salary and monthly incentives based on attendance, productivity and profit bonus, overall cost reduction bonus. High fixed salaries will only increase the monthly fixed overhead.
6. Introduction of new products with high profit margins and discontinuance of low profit margin products.
7. Strengthen corporate governance measures.
8. Making the suppliers and buyers, the shareholders of the company.
9. Seek extended credit from suppliers and lower credit periods to buyers.
10. Product/product line innovation.

It is essential and of paramount importance to prop up our industrial sector even in areas like petroleum and other energy sources, so that our future import bills will come down. Import substitution industries would be the key for us to become a net foreign exchange earner. It may not be a bad idea to set aside 0.25% of VAT collected by the state for one year, to be placed in an industrial sector development fund. This industrial development fund could raise additional finance through foreign donor grants and financial assistance for specific projects from similar organizations abroad. Further, the foreign buyers may introduce advance monies to companies with buy-back agreements of products specially manufactured for them. By this way, a ready export market could be developed for industrial output. This fund could also raise a line of credit with foreign governments/agencies or with European Union to modernize all our industrial concerns to meet international standards. This is a very workable arrangement rather than waiting for foreign investors to come and invest. Once we set this scheme in motion, there will be a queue of foreign investors to invest in Sri Lanka. Further three nominee directors of chambers of commerce be appointed to the directorate of BOI along with three directors nominated by the Government.
Main objectives of this fund include the following.
1. Value addition to the entire industrial sector and specially selected industries and companies.
2. Tocarry out exclusive research on foreign markets, consumer preferences and changes in country trade policies.
3. To source out niche markets for our exporters.
4. To establish a new quality governance agency to meet the requirements of sectorial market segments in overseas countries, example Japanese, European Union, US, UK and other selected markets.
5. To set up exclusive investment zones in Sri Lanka with more investor friendly Labour Laws.
6. To widen raw material supply sources in Sri Lanka.
7. Promotion of investments from our own expatriates settled in overseas countries.
8. To strengthen foreign investment protection laws.
9. To improve the morale, job security and emoluments of industrial work force in Sri Lanka at all levels.
10. To set up a high- tech labour training institute with international standards.
11. To settle union action within hours and reach win win solutions.

Public officials now  fear to steal-President
Public officials have developed a fear to commit wrongdoing, fraud and corruption in the last three years giving rise to a positive culture in the public service, President Maitripala Sirisena said.
The President said he was glad to see that change under his rule.
He was addressing the National Awards Ceremony organised by the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) to recognise the State Institutions with high level of performance held at the Parliament Complex yesterday.
The public officials fear to commit wrong had vanished over the past years, especially because of the misconduct of politicians in power. We have been able to gradually change this attitude. Now I hear them saying that they would have to go to the CID or the FCID if they do wrong. We have had a committed and clean public service in the past and I want to restore the same in the country under my rule, the President said.
President Sirisena pointed out the background for public officials to work with a backbone has been created in the country ending the years of political meddling into officials work.
Politicians who misused power broke the backbone of our public officials. The honest and intrepid public servants and their families were harassed and attacked. It is not easy to change this culture which prevailed for 35-40 years. We have begun the process and let us create an excellent public service by rectifying the existing shortcomings, the President noted.
Eighty one state institutions which showed high performance levels in the year 2015 were recognised at the ceremony yesterday with gold, silver and merit awards.
The President, while congratulating them, also told the organisers to invite the institutions with the lowest performance level to the next awards ceremony so that their performance could be questioned publicly.
COPA Chairman Lasantha Alagiyawanna and Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake also spoke. Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe, Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala and COPA members were present. (Reported by Sandasen Marasinghe, Camelia Nathaniel and Disna Mudalige)

Sagala responds to baseless and malicious allegations
Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka categorically denied allegations that he had a secret meeting with former Presidents Chief of Staff Gamini Senarath, who is suspected to have embezzled Rs.4 billion in public money.
Ratnayaka in a statement said that he has no reason to meet a suspect in a corruption case which involves billions of public money.
I have nothing to gain by holding a meeting with a person of that calibre, he said.
The full statement:
It is widely known that a small clique affiliated with the top-brass leaders of the previous government were involved in large scale bribery and corruption cases.
Their corrupt practices pushed over 6.2 million people to come forward on January 08, 2015, in a bid to topple the Rajapaksa government. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who gave leadership to these progressive forces, played prominent roles in this silent revolution.
The Government of Good Governance and its ministers came to power with the promise of investigating into these cases of large scale corruption and bringing the culprits to book.
I, as the Minister of Law and Order, have a special responsibility in this regard and I must state that I am committed and determined to fulfill that responsibility.
Despite many challenges and obstacles, the Sri Lanka Police, the Police Criminal Investigations Department (CID), and the Police Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) and I, as the Minister, endeavour to deliver results, in this regard. It is in this context that a section of the media, including some online publications and social media pages, have published news items indicating that former Presidents Chief of Staff Gamini Senarath, who is suspected to have embezzled Rs 4 billion of public money, had a secret meeting with me.
This a baseless and malicious allegation. I have no reason to meet a suspect in a corruption case which involves billions of public money. I have nothing to gain by holding meeting with a person of that calibre.
Therefore, I categorically deny this malicious allegation with the contempt it deserves. I am of the firm belief that a handful of bankrupt political elements with hidden agendas are behind this propaganda campaign.

SLs dairy farmers get US$ 21 mn
US Department of Agriculture through the Food for Progress Program announced a new US$ 21 million project to help increase the productivity of Sri Lankas dairy sector, and connect thousands of Sri Lankan farmers to local and regional markets, Under Secretary for Political Affairs Thomas A. Shannon, Jr. said.
He was speaking at the US-Sri Lanka Partnership Dialogue.
Renewing our commitment towards strengthening the bond between Sri Lanka and USA, the United States Peace Corps will work with the Sri Lankan government to return American volunteers to Sri Lankas English classrooms.
As we know, English language ability opens doors to greater economic and educational opportunities, and opens a window on to a wider world. We stand ready with the talents of our best and brightest Americans in recognition of the progress Sri Lanka has made towards ensuring peace and stability for its entire people.
The United States will also offer a second US Coast Guard cutter to the Sri Lankan Navy, pending completion of Congressional notification. As the government of Sri Lanka moves ahead with its reforms to promote justice, accountability, reconciliation, and human rights, the United States will continue to partner with Sri Lanka to foster economic development and advance equal rights and opportunities for all persons in Sri Lanka.

Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by three wickets in their final Group B match of the Under 19 Youth Asia Cup tournament in Malaysia on Monday.
Both teams finished their league matches equal on 4 points each with Pakistan on top on a superior run rate. However they must await the final league game between Afghanistan and UAE today to see which of the top two teams from the group will qualify for the semi-finals.
Afghanistan with a better run rate than Sri Lanka need only to beat UAE to go through to the last four with Pakistan.
Group A is still open with India and Nepal currently heading the table with 2 points each and Bangladesh having won the only match they played against India.
Sri Lanka were bundled out for a disappointing 141 in 49.4 overs with Ashen Bandara being the only batsmen to make a noteworthy contribution with 49 off 95 balls. Pakistan knocked the required runs off in 32.1 overs losing seven wickets with Praveen Jayawickrama again amongst the wickets with figures of 4 for 28.

Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau,  title sponsor of annual British Guild  of Travel Writers Awards, London
Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau was the title sponsor of the prestigious British Guild of Travel Writers Awards held at The Savoy Hotel in London last week. This is the first time that Sri Lanka sponsored this black tie event, joining the ranks of past sponsors such as Virgin Atlantic Airways, Oman Ministry of Tourism and City of Las Vegas, to name a few.
The annual gala attracted the crme de la crme of British travel journalists and 330 high profile media and industry leaders who gathered to recognise and honour excellence in travel writing. Among those present were Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga, High Commissioner for Sri Lanka in the United Kingdom, Amari Wijewardane and Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau, Udaya Nanayakkara.
Elaborate arrangements were in place to provide an authentic Sri Lankan experience to the guests who were treated to Sri Lankan cocktails, music and souvenir photographs on arrival. Traditional drummers and dancers welcomed the VIP guests into the room, followed by a traditional lamp lighting ceremony.
Nanayakkara welcomed the distinguished guests with the traditional greeting Ayubowan! Delivering the welcome address he said, Sri Lanka Tourism is proud to partner with this prestigious event, the British Travel Writers Awards. It is our intention that all of you here this evening visit our beautiful island home  Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is a resplendent island like no other.
Our vision is to be recognised as the worlds finest island for memorable, authentic and diverse experience. Our mission is to be a high value destination, offering extraordinary experiences that reflect Sri Lankas natural and cultural heritage; are socially inclusive and drive economic benefits to communities and the country, he added.
Nanayakkara emphasised that having been in a state of conflict for over 30 years, Sri Lanka is now at peace, with tourism growing exponentially from a mere 500,000 during the conflict to over 2 million arrivals today.
In his address, Minister Amaratunga praised the Sri Lanka Promotion Bureau for taking the initiative to sponsor the event and thanked the Guild and media for their support. The main reason for the positive growth in visitors numbers from the UK is the fact that British tourists have come to realise that Sri Lanka is a home away from home due to its centuries long historical connections that include English being one of three official languages in the country and a Westminster style system of governance," the Minister said. "Our changing political landscape based on good governance, respect for human rights, upholding of democratic values and a vibrant, engaging foreign policy have ensured close bilateral relations between the two countries.
Following his address, Minister Amaratunga presented a special gift of recognition to the Chairman of the Guild as well as some of the prestigious awards.
The audience was treated to some of the countrys major attractions such as peacocks dancing, whales splashing in the crystal blue water, the magnificent Gathering of Elephants, the incredible Esala Perahera in Kandy and surfing in Arugam Bay. Where in the world can you find the two largest mammals on land and in the sea: elephants and whales  Sri Lanka! said Nanayakkara.
The evening started with Ceylon arrack cocktails and Lion Beer flown in especially for the event. The menu, prepared by the highly skilled chefs of The Savoy incorporated the best Ceylon tea into its ingredients. The finale was a tea ceremony produced by Malik Fernando of Resplendent Ceylon.
During the evening, guests were treated to a variety of videos and images of the country and entertained by Sri Lankan singer Alston Koch, who flew in especially for the occasion from California. The evening was eloquently presented by Adrian Phillips, Managing Director of Bradt Guides and Jennifer Howze, Co-founder of britmums.com.
The occasion also provided the guests the opportunity to plan a trip to Sri Lanka and four lucky guests won a holiday for two with flights courtesy of SriLankan, Emirates and Qatar Airways.
Accommodation was provided courtesy of Cinnamon Hotels, Shangri-La and Aitken Spence Hotels. These awards were presented in the raffle that raised 5,000 for the charity nominated by BGTW, the Joliba Trust who work tirelessly to support marginal communities in Africa.

Sri Lanka unearth another mystery spinner Kevin Koththigoda
Spinners with unorthodox actions have always been a talking point in rival camps. So when 18-year-old Kevin Koththigoda bowled in the ongoing U-19 Asia Cup in Malaysia, Sri Lankas opponents kept talking about him.
The leg-spinner has a bowling action similar to former South Africa chinaman Paul Adams.
Koththigoda, who hails from Unawatuna, is a right-arm leg-spinner and has featured in Sri Lankas 61-run win against Afghanistan. He took one wicket in that match.
Koththigoda was nurtured by former Sri Lanka A opener Dhammika Sudarshana at Richmond College, Galles leading school that has produced several Test cricketers.
He has a very unusual action. Its like that of Paul Adams. The action wasnt coached or anything, it came naturally to him. Initially, he was struggling with the length as he couldnt see the pitch, but he has improved tremendously, Sudarshana said.
He came with his parents and asked me whether he could change schools. It was a fair request and we didnt have any objections, Sudarshana explained.
Since his action is unique, the batsmen get confused. He is an excellent fielder and a decent batsman. He has got a very bright future ahead of him, Sudarshana added.

Sumanthiran responds to Rajapakshe accusation that Constitutional Assembly is illegal

TNA parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran has responded to former Justice and Buddasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshes accusations that the Constitutional Assembly process is illegal, saying Rajapakshe was one of the original proponents of the resolution to form a Constitutional Assembly.
Former Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has taken up the position that the Constitutional Assembly process is illegal  Id like to point out that he is one of the original proposers of the resolution that was placed before the Parliament on January 9, 2016, which proposed the setting up of this Constitutional Assembly, the TNA parliamentarian said.
He is actually one of the drafters of that resolution having proposed it to the Parliament. He has also been a member of the Steering Committee  which met 73 times and he has attended more than 50 times and participated fully in that process. He has even drafted certain portions of the Interim Report that was tabled before the Constitutional Assembly recently, Sumanthiran said.
He said Rajapakshe was fully aware of this process and was satisfied that it was entirely constitutional and legal:His opposition now arises only because he has been sacked from the Cabinet, the TNA parliamentarian said.
He added, He cant say that he did not know of the implications of this  he holds two doctoral degrees and a Presidents Counsel, he has been President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and at the time he was the Minister of Justice  such a person cant now suddenly say the process is illegal, having participated fully and having himself proposed the mechanism.

Thirtieth death anniversary of Fr. Michel Rodrigo OMI: The saint who braved out
I am a Catholicin my religion, buta Buddhistin my culture.- Rev. Fr. Michel Rodrigo O.M.I
Thirty years ago, on November 10, 1987, while Rev. Fr. Michel Rodrigo OMI was celebrating the Holy Eucharist, he was shot and killed at his small shelter in Alukalawita, Buttala.
Fr. Michael was born to a middle class family. He was educated at St. Peters College, Colombo. After being becoming a priest, Fr. Michael continued with his theological studies; obtaining a doctorate from the Institut Catholique de Paris (ICP). On returning to Sri Lanka he was appointed a lecturer at the National Seminary. Soon thereafter, he received an offer from ICP to be a Professor of Theology. He declined this offer in order to work with Bishop Leo Nanayakkara, in the Badulla Diocese.
In 1980 he set up a Christian-Buddhist dialogue centre, Suba Seth Gedera, in the village called Alukalawita, Buttala. Local Buddhist monks were initially suspicious of the tiny Christian community of which he was part, but came to recognise that he was not a rival. Fr. Mike, the nuns and lay workers who worked alongside him, became trusted figures, undertaking educational activities and caring for their neighbours.
It was the terrible time of insurgency in 1987-89. Reportedly, after a local businessman was shot at by suspected insurgents, armed men claiming to be from the police searched the small house of Buttala, Alukalawita community headed by Fr. Michel Rodrigo. They threatened him, though he pointed out that the activities of their centre were peaceful. Reluctant to abandon the villagers, but concerned about his companions safety, he asked them to decide whether the community should leave or stay, though his own preference was to remain. The community was to take a decision at this particular Holly Mass.
It was a few days before the assassination of Fr. Michael Rodrigo. I wanted to see him at Suba Seth Gedara. I used to see him together with my wife Ramya at least once a month. We both came all the way from Passara to experience the real life with community of Alukalawita Buttala. We did a lot of educational and cultural programmes in the village together with Fr. Mike and other members of the community. When I came there all the members of the community (except Fr. Mike) had left the village. When I asked why he did not leave the village he said that he was compelled by his conscience not to leave the helpless villagers in this hour of crisis.
Community members
Fr. Michael was more overwhelmed by the suffering, which the poor villagers were forced to tolerate than by the threats made by the tragic situation prevailing at that time in the country. Many friends had asked him to leave the area at least for a shorter period. He did not do so because he voluntarily accepted the miserable poverty of the villagers, a part of his own life.
After some time he prepared some tea. He gave one cup of tea to me. We had tea and discussed many things regarding the pathetic situation. He had been highly worried that the previous night some armed officers had come to the adjoining house and hammered an old mother asking for her son. He had been shocked on seeing the way they had tortured the innocent mother. It was about 12.30 in the afternoon. A small poor village boy came with a small basket of food. When the community members were away, villagers used to share food with him. He invited me to share his lunch. It was a mallum (herbs) and a curry of sprats with rice. He divided the food into three parts. One was given to me the other was for the pet animals that were hanging around him. He ate the smallest portion. He expected the community members would be back soon.
After lunch I said good bye to him. It was the last time I saw him alive. A few days later I got the message that he had been assassinated. When I went there together with Fr. Joe Fernando, the body was still lying in blood on the small alter on which he used to say Holy Mass. We carried the body for the post-mortem.
This is the social as well as spiritual commitment of a man who sacrificed his life in the process of reducing his own dimension to enhance the dimension of the life of the poor devoid of religious and ethnic divisions. Those who held firm to human rights for all often found themselves isolated and targeted.
During this period the island was gradually being overwhelmed by violence, as an increasingly dictatorial and divisive government shut off opportunities for democratic opposition, driving many towards rebel groups which, in turn, terrorized hapless civilians.
Religious institution
While the military killed rebel fighters and civilians, state-sponsored paramilitary squads detained, tortured, assassinated or made disappear suspected dissidents. Some Sinhalese youth joined the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, which at the time sought to overthrow the government by violence.
Fr. Michael was a rare exception in that he opted to exercise his priestly duties outside the limits of a parish, a school or other religious institution. He realized that Christianity as conventionally practised in Sri Lanka as well as other parts of the world. He wanted to be realistic in his mission and to abide by the second greatest commandment Love your neighbour as yourself (Mark 12:29-31, Luke 10: 25- 28, Matthew 22: 34-40) of Jesus. So with the approval and assistance of Bishop Leo Nanayakkara O.S.B then bishop of Badulla Diocese, Fr. Michael established a Christian-Buddhist Dialogue Centre which he called Suba Seth Gedera, in Alukavita, Buttala in lower Uva. He maintained close contact with the people in the surrounding villages, engaging in ceaseless activities as their mentor, counsellor and companion in distress. Fr Mike wanted the villagers to be real Buddhists. He was totally against mere conversion. He believed and taught us that inner transformation of a person is the most important. For this, a person does not need to change his religion. He or she has to change his/her wrong attitudes and seek and abide by the deeper values of his / her own religion instead.
Fr. Mike used to say, if one is not taking sides with the poor then one is certainly on the side of the oppressors. Fr. Mike would never have come to death if he had been willing to compromise with injustice.

The International Schools of Sri Lanka (TISSL), which is an association of premier international schools in Sri Lanka, was formed in 2001 with the main aim of fostering good relationships with its 25 member schools. The association also organizes annual international conferences with heads and decision makers of member international schools and non-member international schools, state schools and private schools in the region in order to exchange best practices and enhance the quality of teaching-learning practices in schools. It will beheld from November 17 to 19 at the Blue Water, Wadduwa.
Over the past three decades, there has been a significant rise in the number of international schools in Sri Lanka following English medium instruction, which has been due to the growing demand of parents opting to educate their children in a language that the world speaks.
This years TISSL Conference will take place at the cross roads between extensive infrastructure development of educational institutions in the government sector as well as educational institutions in the private sector. With this in mind, the Chairperson of the TISSL association leading the TISSL Conference Organizing Committee - Mrs. Kumari Grero and her team, identified a timely theme for this conference  Unleashing Problem Solvers.
Under this theme, three reputed professionals from foreign countries have been invited to share their expertise to school leaders and decision makers in Sri Lankas international schools community, in order to help them identify and tackle any upcoming issues during the planning phase of this infrastructure development.
Pearson and Cambridge Assessment International Education are the Principal Sponsors of this event and will each host a prominent speaker to share their expertise related to the theme of the conference. The British Council teamed up as a Co-Sponsor and will sponsor Sir Michael Wilshaw, who will grace this event as the Chief Guest and deliver the key note address to participants. With over 50 years of experience in education and successful incumbencies as the former Chief Inspector of Schools in England and the former head of Ofsted, his insights on education will be extremely beneficial and relevant to the theme of this conference. Another Co-Sponsor of this event is Monash University.
Dr. Mathew Anderson - sponsored by Pearson-Edexcel and Dr. Mark Winterbottom  sponsored by Cambridge Assessment International Education, are VIP delegates who are both also very prominent figures in the international education industry. They will each share their experiences in a topic related to the theme of the conference.
The TISSL conference will also highlight and demonstrate TISSLs commitment to bring best practices of world class education and foster close co-operation between member schools and all other schools in Sri Lanka who are faced with this challenge. A variety of presentation formats await all participants, which include the key note address as well as other speeches backed by multi-media presentations, speech moderation and interactive group activities. A dance item and choir performance will also add colour and value to the three day event.
As this conference is a unique platform and an international forum to exchange ideas and experiences, the TISSL association warmly welcomes and encourages all school leaders and professionals in the field of education to attend this conference and benefit from this rare opportunity where likeminded individuals can come together and form new alliances, whilst exchanging perspectives that would aid in the betterment of our countrys education system for generations to come.

Why we should opt for sustainable mode
While environmental protection is vital, a fundamental problem facing conservation is finance  especially for the vast amount of the planets biodiversity that lies outside of protected areas. New market-based mechanisms that encourage biodiversity and resource conservation are a promising set of tools to help take conservation and sustainable natural resource management to global scale and significance while simultaneously benefitting the guardians of those services  the often marginalized forest communities.
Quote- In the words of Prof Ranil Senanayake, Primary Ecosystem Services are those produced by the photosynthetic activity of plants. These are: production of Oxygen, sequestration of Carbon Dioxide, cleaning water and providing ambient cooling. They help us breathe, have drinking water, food, and protect from excessive heat. The value of PES is about $2000-3000. Per acre per year if Sri Lanka capitalized these values we could escape from out debt trap in two years.
How does it work
Ecosystemsforests, mountains, wetlands, agricultural land, freshwaterprovide a variety of services that are economically valuable: fresh water supply for human settlements (e.g. by filtering the water from contaminants); irrigation and power generation; or storm protection and pollination.
Potential in monetary terms
The World Resource Institute has estimated the value of ecosystem services to be US$33 trillion a year, but these values remain largely on paper. The largest PES is found in water and carbon sequestration (carbon markets are profiled as a separate solution). In its broadest definition also ecological fiscal transfers, payments for an agricultural conservation easement, and biodiversity offsets can be broadly profiled as PES.
The provision of such services might require communities living in the proximity of the ecosystem to undertake or not to undertake certain activities. The Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) is the mechanism that governs these payments. In other words, PES involves a series of payments to land or other natural resource owners in return for a guaranteed flow of ecosystem services or certain actions likely to enhance their provision over-and-above what would otherwise be provided in the absence of payment.
When is it feasible
Legal and/other feasibility requirements
The feasibility assessment for a PES should look at (or produce when missing): 1. the economic valuation of ecosystem services; 2. the legal and institutional framework for PES transaction; 3. the level of organization of stakeholders; and 4. the capacity to pay of beneficiaries and providers.
Minimum investment required and running costs
The running costs of the PES scheme include financial transaction costs, measuring, reporting and verification (MRV) and regulatory oversight. These might also include communication, negotiation, enforcement costs, and provisions for legal risks. There is evidence that transaction costs are often higher than anticipated in the design.
In what context/when it is more appropriate
PES are most likely to appear in situations where clearly identifiable actions that can increase the supply of a service are identified and/or when there is a clear demand for the service(s) in question, whose provision is commercially viable. On the contrary, PES should not be established when no beneficiary of the ecosystem services can be clearly identified or where the actions to be compensated cannot clearly be connected with their impact on the flow of ecosystem services.
Sri Lanka should seriously consider implementing this programme to correct the exploitation of natural resources and its owners, induce sustainable environmental practices and practice sound economics. Most importantly as Ranil Senanayake states, there is a transfer of wealth to rural areas which crucially enable life in urban areas.
The preparatory process of establishing a PES can be described in the subsequent steps which are followed by the negotiation of the agreements, the actual legal structuring, the financing and the implementation. These are:
1. Identification of the ecosystem services and geographical boundaries;
2. Identification of the sellers/providers and buyers/beneficiaries;
3. Definition of the market and of the price;
4. Determination of the governance, institutional and legal arrangements;
5. Collection of the biophysical data baseline data for the monitoring system.
Stakeholders
1. The buyer/beneficiary of an ecosystem service: the entity, either an individual/company or the Government that directly benefits from the existence of an ecosystem and is willing/capable to pay for its preservation.
2. The seller/provider of an ecosystem service: Any individual or community whose land use or other decision can influence the provision of ecosystem services. She/he will obtain a payment to undertake or not to undertake (e.g. not exercising certain economic rights) certain activities to preserve the provision of ecosystem services. The payment can thus compensate for a lost income (reduced gains from agriculture) or human labour and capital investment (e.g. planting trees).
3. Public authority: the public authority (often a local entity) might disburse payments and collect mandatory fees and taxes. PES often requires the issuance of a law or Government decree/regulation if intermediated or paid by public resources. If PES is negotiated among private parties, the Government usually acts as a broker or facilitator.
4. Affected community: Everyone who benefits from the provision of an ecosystem service. This refers to the larger population who might benefit from ecosystem services but, for a number of reasons, is not formally participating in the PES as a beneficiary or provider of services.
What are the main risks and challenges
Pros
Flexible instrument compared to command-and-control regulation, allowing high customization to local circumstances.
Behavioural changes are promoted with positive incentives rather than coercion, more likely leading to transformational change.
PES can help to correct market failures by pricing conservation efforts.
PES provides opportunities for cash income in rural areas where poverty might be concentrated.
Rural communities can benefit from increased knowledge of sustainable resource use practices that are usually connected to PES through the provision of training and technical assistance.
Cons
The economic valuation of ecosystem services is a difficult and still costly process, despite innovations in techniques and technology.
PES implementation might be costly due to the specifics of design, negotiation and implementation of the programme.
PES are not designed to reduce poverty but primarily to offer economic incentives to foster the conservation of ecosystem services. Additional measures need to be enforced to make PES pro-poor.
The efficacy of PES implementation is partially connected to the availability of data on land property, which is a known challenge in many developing countries.
PES might result in limiting the flexibility of local government and communities in making decisions on their own development particularly where easements or long-term contracts specify a narrow range of alternatives.
The Vittel experience is most likely to be replicable in places where land cannot be purchased and set aside for conservation, and where the risk to business is high while the link between ecosystem health and farming practices is well understood and expected benefits are sufficiently high to justify the investment. Vittel mineral water originates in Grande Source (Great Spring) located in the town of Vittel at the foot of the Vosges Mountains in north-eastern France. In 1854, the spring was purchased by the Bouloumi family and a spa developed in the town of Vittel. Rapidly the reputation of Grande Source spread and people travelled from all over Europe to drink its waters. The idea of bottling and marketing the water developed and in 1882, the Socit Gnrale des Eaux Minrales de Vittel (SGEMV) and the Vittel brand were created. By 1898, one million bottles had been sold. A century later, one billion bottles of Vittel mineral water are sold every year, in 70 countries. Vittel waters are characterised by a total absence of nitrites and a particularly low level of nitrates. To be labelled Vittel, the water cannot contain more than 4.5 mg of nitrates per litre and must not contain pesticides.
Extensive hydro-geological modelling was conducted in the perimeter and showed that ensuring a nitrate rate of 4.5mg/l in Grande Source required maintaining nitrate levels at the root zone (up to 1.5 meters below the surfacee) at 10mg/l.
A four step methodology was developed:
1. Understand the farming systems and why farmers do what they do.
2. Analyse the conditions under which farmers would consider changing farmingbehaviour.
3. Identify, test, and validate in farmers fields the management practices necessary to reduce the nitrate threat.
4. Provide financial and technical support to farmers willing to enter the programme.

World Diabetes Day: Women and Diabetes
As the theme of the world diabetic day, we need to promote the importance of cost effective management of diabetes mellitus in Sri Lanka. This will highlight the importance of affordable and accessible diabetic care for women. All women at risk or living with diabetes need to have easy access to diabetes medicine, self-management education, and information they need to achieve optimal outcome and ability to prevent type 2 diabetes.
Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough insulin. In the past three decades, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels.
The Primary Care Diabetic Group Sri Lanka was registered as a voluntary Social services/Non-Governmental Organization under Voluntary Social Services Organization Act No. 31 of 1980 as amended by Act No. 8 of 1998 on January 23, 2009. Its Head Office is at CeyMed, Stanley Thilakaratne Mawatha, Nugegoda. We do promote public education on Diabetes and render assistance to the needy patients with Diabetes Mellitus.
As the theme of the world diabetic day, we need to promote the importance of cost effective management of diabetes mellitus in Sri Lanka. This will highlight the importance of affordable and accessible diabetic care for women. All women at risk or living with diabetes need to have easy access to diabetes medicine, self-management education, and information they need to achieve optimal outcome and ability to prevent type 2 diabetes.
Key messages
All women with diabetes in Sri Lanka need to have easy access to diabetic care and health education to manage their diabetes and improve their health outcomes at an affordable price.
Currently there are over 199 million women living with diabetes in the world. This total is projected to increase to 300 million by 2040. The majority of this rise will affect the South Asian region of the world. Furthermore, two out of every five women with diabetes are of reproductive age, accounting for over 60 million women worldwide.
Diabetes is the ninth leading cause of death in women globally, causing over 2 million deaths annually and women with type 2 diabetes mellitus are 10 times more likely to develop ischemic heart disease than women without the condition.
Women with type 1 diabetes have an increased risk of early miscarriage or having a baby with malformations.
What needs to be done
Health systems in Sri Lanka must recognize and give adequate attention to the specific needs and priorities of women with diabetes mellitus.
This is in addition to all women with diabetes needing to have easy access to cost effective management and anti-diabetic drugs and investigations such as FBS, HbA1c, self-management education and information they need to achieve good glycemic control.
All women with diabetes should have access to pre-conception planning and screening services to reduce risk to the mother and fetus during pregnancy. All women and girls should have access and encouragement to physical activity and nutrition to improve their health outcomes and prevent childhood obesity.
Pregnant women require improved access to screening, care and education to achieve positive health outcomes for mother and child.
Supporting evidence
One in six births is affected by diabetes in pregnancy. (Gestational Diabetes Mellitus - GDM) International Diabetes Federation estimates that 20.9 million or 16.2% of live births to women in 2015 had some form of hyperglycemia during pregnancy. Approximately half of women with a history of GDM go on to develop type 2 diabetes within five to ten years after delivery. Half of all cases of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) in pregnancy occur in women under the age of 30 years.
Most cases of hyperglycemia in pregnancy were in low and middle income countries, where access to maternal care (Antenatal care) is often limited.
What needs to be done
Prevention of Type 2 diabetes must focus on women health and nutrition and other health behaviours before and during pregnancy. Antenatal care visits during pregnancy must be encouraged for health promotion in young women and early detection of diabetes and GDM.
Furthermore, screening for diabetes and GDM should be integrated into other maternal health interventions and services at primary healthcare level to ensure early detection, better care for women and reduced maternal mortality. This is now in progress in Sri Lanka in antenatal clinics.
Primary health care workers should be trained in the identification, treatment, management and follow-up of diabetes during pregnancy.
It is important that women and girls adopt healthy lifestyles to improve the health of future generations. Up to 70 percent of cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented through the adoption of a healthy lifestyle. In addition, 70 percent of premature deaths among adults are largely due to behavior initiated during adolescence.
Women, as mothers, have a huge influence over the long-term health status of their children and research has shown that when mothers are granted greater control over resources, they allocate more to food, childrens health and nutrition, and education.
Women are the gatekeepers of household nutrition and lifestyle habits and therefore have the potential to drive prevention from the household and beyond.
What can be done towards prevention
Women and girls should be empowered with easy and equitable access to knowledge and resources to strengthen their capacity to prevent type 2 diabetes in their families and better safeguard their own health.
Promoting opportunities for physical exercise in adolescent girls, particularly in developing countries, must be a priority for diabetes prevention.
Cornerstones of diabetes management with the use of PCDG App

Road to becoming preferred transshipment port of Bangladesh - in the eyes of CASA
Diplomatic ties between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka
President Maithripala Sirisenas three day visit to Bangladesh in July 2017 was important and timely for strong bilateral ties between the two countries. Following bilateral discussions a few important agreements were signed between the two countries on increasing economic co-operation.
The importance of Colombo as a transshipment hub for Bangladesh has been reiterated and naming Colombo as the preferred transshipment port of Bangladesh has also been discussed. Industry analysts state that this is a very commendable step taken by the government and should be followed up with further discussions.
The two South Asian nations have been historically tied since before the sub-continent's colonisation by the British. The volume of trade between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka increased to over USD 115 million in 2014-15 from USD 24 million ten years ago.
Although the growth of bilateral trade in the last few years is significant, the volume of trade is not commensurate with its potentials. The two countries are members of the South Asian Free Trade Area, also known as SAFTA, which is a multilateral free trade agreement committed to reducing tariffs and facilitating trade in the South Asian region.
Regional outlook
The container throughput globally grew by an estimated 6.7% in the first six months of 2017 and the momentum is expected to continue in the second half, based on a survey done by Alphaliner. Based on Figure 1, South Asian ports recorded the strongest growth rate of 9.3% whilst India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh being significant contributors in this growth.
In 2015 the container throughput of India was 12.31 million TEUs whereas Sri Lanka and Bangladesh recorded 5.2 million TEUs and 1.87 million TEUs respectively. The continuing growth of the Apparel Industry is one reason for this regional growth as Apparel exports in the region have grown by 10% annually from 2005 to 2014.
Strategic importance of Colombo Port for Bangladesh
The Bangladesh economy has recorded a steady growth of close to 6% and is expected to grow at 5.8% annually from 2015 to 2025. The main commodities imported are raw textile materials and consumables whereas the main commodities exported are finished articles of clothing and apparel to Europe and North America.
The Government of Bangladesh has initiated several schemes such as liberalizing trade, improving transport, supporting entrepreneurship by reducing the transaction costs of doing business, and strengthening the transparency and accountability of both the public and private sectors. Exports of textiles and garments will be the principal source of foreign exchange earnings for Bangladesh.
To be competitive in the apparel industry, Bangladesh will have to look for more cost effective and time efficient transportation methods. Transshipment efficiency and flexible supply chain solutions such as sea/air and air/sea would be vital to remaining competitive in this dynamic industry. The Port of Colombo is ranked 33 among top 50 container ports according to the World Shipping Council rankings and has handled over 5.7 million TEUs in 2016 with over 75% being transshipment TEUs. Colombo has become South Asias topmost container transshipment hub with transshipment volumes increasing from 3.2 million in 2013 to 4.35 million in 2016. This is one main reason why Colombo has become a must stop port for the top 20 lines.
Colombo and Hambantota would be preferred transshipment ports for Bangladesh exporters due to a few factors. As the Apparel Industry relies on speed-to-market, savings in transit time will have a significant impact on the supply chain. For example, shipping cargo westbound from Bangladesh via Singapore would involve at least 4 days of sailing from Bangladesh to Singapore and a further 4 days of sailing from Singapore to cross Sri Lanka.
However shipping the same cargo via Colombo would instantaneously reduce 4 days of sailing time since it only takes 4 days to get to Colombo from Bangladesh. This would also reduce the carbon footprint which can appeal to eco-friendly customers in the west.
Both Colombo and Hambantota can provide flexible supply chain solutions such as sea/air and air/sea due to the proximity of the airport to the seaport. Bangladesh exporters will also have the opportunity of consolidating cargo in the South Asian region which will provide consolidation benefits to both the shipper and the consignee.
Way Forward
It is important to take discussions that would make Colombo the preferred transshipment port for Bangladesh forward as this will benefit Sri Lanka Ports Authority in many ways. Throughput overall will increase and, in particular, will benefit JCT in terms of increased number of feeders calling Colombo.
In the meantime, SLPAs overall capacity is expected to increase with the operation the Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT), and the proposed East Container Terminal (ECT) and West Container Terminal (WCT) coming into operation subsequently. This will provide better sailing options and connections for Bangladesh exporters. Infrastructure investments of this nature is quite beneficial for the country and its economy.
Going forward, SLPA will have to facilitate increased volumes from Bangladesh by reducing the waiting time for such feeders by way of dedicated berthing arrangements in shallower berths or allowing Bangladesh feeders to berth at any terminal with free or less costly Inter Terminal Trucking (ITT) charges. Such initiatives will result in savings on fuel and efficiency gains which will bring down the net cost of transshipments in Colombo.

The 13th Amendment on watch
There are severalSupreme Court judgments which analyzed and interpretedthe provisions ofthe 13th Amendmentand ProvincialCouncil systemin relation to identification,demarcation and utilizationof State land
The Thirteenth Amendment has introduced a new conception of a unitary  decentralized State based on a system of Provincial Government at a sub-national level. This description is of extreme importance, since the Constitution specifically provides that the Republic of Sri Lanka is a Unitary State and the majority of the people attach much sentiment to the unitariness of Sri Lanka. The 13th Amendment to the Constitution provides for the establishment of Provincial Councils. Basic to the structure of devolution is the competence jurisdiction  the separation of subjects and functions assigned to the Provincial Council and the Centre. This separation is set out in the three lists under the Ninth Schedule to the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution: Provincial Council List (List I), Reserved List (List II) and Concurrent List (List III).
There are several Supreme Court judgments which analyzed and interpreted the provisions of the 13th Amendment and Provincial Council system in relation to identification, demarcation and utilization of State land. As decided by the Supreme Court in regarding the 13th Amendment to the Constitution both in respect of the exercise of its legislative powers and in respect of the exercise of the executive powers, no exclusive or independent power is vested in the Provincial Council. Accordingly, the Parliament and the President have ultimate control over them and remain supreme.
The Land Ownership Bill
The Supreme Court stated in the Determination of the Bill titled Land Ownership that with the passing of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, such constitutional power vested with the President was qualified by virtue of the paragraph 1.3 of Appendix II to the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. By such provision the authority for alienation or disposition of State land within a Province to any citizen or to any organisation was yet vested with the President. In effect even after the establishment of Provincial Councils in 1987, State land continued to be vested in the Republic and disposition of State land could be carried out only in accordance with Article 33(d) of the Constitution read with 1.3 of Appendix II to the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution.
In this Bill titled Land Ownership the petitioner had challenged the constitutionality of the Bill by petitions presented to the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution. The Bill provided for the holder of land under a grant made in terms of section 19(4) of the Land Development Ordinance or section 3 of the Land Grants (Special Provisions) Act No.43 of 1979 to apply for his existing rights to be converted into full ownership, free of all encumbrances. The Supreme Court had decided that the Bill in question being of a matter set out in the Provincial Council List, does not become law unless it has been referred by the President to every Provincial Council as required by Article 154 (G) (3) of the Constitution. As noted by the Court, the Bill has totally ignored the concept of the Presidents function on the advice of the Provincial Council with regard to the alienation and disposition of State land.
The Supreme Court in Vasudeva Nanayakkara v Choksy & Others Case stated that it is seen that the power reposed in the President in terms of Article 33(d) of the Constitution read with section 2 of the State Lands Ordinance to make grants and dispositions of State land is circumscribed by the provisions of Appendix II cited above. Appendix II in the view of S.N Silva CJ., establishes an interactive legal regime in respect of State land within a Province. While the ultimate power of alienation and of making a disposition remains with the President, the exercise of the power would be subject to the conditions in Appendix II being satisfied. A pre-condition laid down in paragraph 1.3 is that an alienation or disposition of State land within a Province shall be done in terms of the applicable law only on the advice of the Provincial Council. The advice would be of the Board of Ministers communicated through the Governor, the Board of Ministers being responsible in this regard to the Provincial Council.
Solaimuthy Rasu judgment
Another important judgment of the Supreme Court which analyzed and interpreted the provisions of 13th Amendment to the Constitution, to identify and demarcate between the Centre and the Provincial Councils in relation to the subject of State land is Superintendent, Stafford Estate v Solaimuthy Rasu judgment.
At the beginning the Supreme Court sought to identify the demarcation between the Centre and the Provinces with regard to State land. Here the Supreme Court referred to the observations made by Fernando J., in the Determination of the Agrarian Services (Amendment) Bill, where Fernando J., had stated that it is not possible to decide whether a matter is a List III subject by merely looking at the headings in these Lists. Therefore according to the Court it became necessary to examine and scrutinize the relevant Articles contained in the Constitution in relation to land and State land.
The Supreme Court in the Solaimuthy judgment also referred to the observations made by Sharvananda CJ., in Re the 13th Amendment to the Constitution as follows .. both in respect of the exercise of its legislative powers and in respect of the exercise of executive powers, no exclusive or independent powers is vested in the Provincial Councils. The Parliament and President have ultimate control over them and remain supreme.
In the view of the Supreme Court in Solaimuthy judgment, the entirety of State land is referred to in List II (Reserved List) and it is only from this jerminal origin that the Republic could assign to the Provincial Councils land for whatever purposes which are deemed appropriate. It is therefore axiomatic that the greater includes the lessor (Jmme Majus Continent in sc mimus) and having regard to the fact that in a unitary state of government no cession of dominium takes place, the Centre has not ceded, its dominium over State land to the Provincial Councils. The Supreme Court in the Solaimuthy judgment stated that if there is a reservation in List II, the inescapable inference follows that what is reserved to the Republic could only be the larger entirety out of which the 13th Amendment chose to assign some portions of State land to the Provincial Councils and the pertinent question before the Supreme Court is the parameters with which of what is entrusted to the Provinces.
As noted by the Supreme Court in the Solaimuthy judgment, a perusal of the Lists I and II, unequivacally points to the fact that State land as referred to in List II embraces the comprehensive entirety of the corpus of State land out of what is carved out land. List II connotes the greater mass of State land that includes List I as the lesser. But what has been given as land for purposes to be gathered from Appendix II is itself circumscribed by the qualification  Land that is to say rights in and over land, land settlement, land tenure, transfer and alienation of land, land use, land settlement and land improvement to the extent set out in Appendix II (item 18 of List I).
Having set out the overcharging dominium of State land with the Centre, according to the Supreme Court, Appendix II set out special Provisions which would qualify as further limitations on State land assigned to Provincial Councils. These special provisions apart from demonstrating the limited extents of Provincial Councils over land also display unmistakably that State land continues to be a subject of the Centre. Having grafted the brooding presence of the Republic on all State land in List II, List I and then Appendix II and subject to these pervasive provisions, State land is declared to be a Provincial council subject in the second paragraph of Appendix II, but that declaration is only explanatory of the purposes for which the Provincial Councils have been assigned with land. Those purposes are evident in the special provisions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 of Appendix II. In the view of the Court these special provisions also strengthen the position that State land continues to be a subject located in the Centre.
As further stated by the Supreme Court in the Solaimuthy judgment , Appendix II in paragraph 3:4 provides that the powers of the Provincial Councils shall be exercised having due regard to the national policy formulated by the National Land Commission. The National Land Commission which includes representatives of all Provincial Councils would be responsible for the formulation of the National Policy with regard to the use of State Lands. Moreover If and when a National Land Commission is in place, the guidelines formulated by such Commission would govern the power of the Provincial Councils over the subject matter as interpreted in this judgment in relation to State Lands. In the view of the Supreme Court in the Solaimuthy judgment, National Land Commission strengthens the contention that State land lies with the Centre and not with the Provincial Councils.
The judgment also reveals that there are other provisions that indicate that State land lie within the legislative competence of the Centre: Article 154 (G) 7 of the Constitution provides that a Provincial Council has no power to make statutes on any matter set out in List II. One of the matters referred to in that List is State land and Foreshore except to the extent specified in item 18 of List I. According to the Supreme Court all these features referred to above featured the unitary nature of the State. The Supreme Court also referred to Sharvananda CJ., in Re the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, who referred to two essential qualities of a Unitary State as (i) the supremacy of the Central Parliament (ii) the absence of subsidiary sovereign bodies.
Limitations on Provincial Councils
The following pronouncements in summary form on the nature and content of State land under the 13th Amendment have been outlined by the Supreme Court in the Solaimuthy case.
Firstly, Appendix II imposes the restrictions on the land powers given to Provincial Councils. The Constitutional limitations imposed by the legislature shows that in the exercise of its legislative powers, no exclusive power is vested in the Provincial Councils with regard to the subject of land.
Secondly, the Provincial Councils do not therefore exercise sovereign legislative powers and are only subsidiary bodies, exercising limited legislative powers subordinate to that of Parliament.
Thirdly, Provincial Councils can only make statutes to administer, control and utilize State land, if such State land is made available to the Provincial Council by the Government for a Provincial Council subject. When the State makes available to every Provincial Council State Land within the Province required by such Council for a Provincial Council subject, the Provincial Council shall administer, control and utilize such State land, in accordance with the laws and statutes governing the matter.
On further examination of the Solaimuthy judgment, the following points can be presented.
(a). Even if the Government makes available State Land to a Provincial Council, the title to the land still vests with the State.
(b). State land required for the purposes of the Government in a Province, in respect of a reserved or concurrent subject may be utilized by the Government in accordance with the laws governing the matter. The Government shall consult the relevant Provincial Council with regard to the utilization of such land in respect of such subject.
(c). Consultation would mean conference between the Government and the Provincial Council to enable them to reach some kind of agreement.
(d). Alienation or disposition of the State land within a Province to any citizen or to any organization shall be by the President, on the advice of the relevant Provincial Council in accordance with the laws governing the matter.
(e). State Land will continue to vest in the Republic and may be disposed of by the President in accordance with Article 33(d) and written laws governing the matter.

AG tells SC: SAITM to be abolished
The Attorney General yesterday informed the Supreme Court that a Presidential Committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena has recommended to abolish SAITM and resolve other issues pertaining to the SAITM before December 31 this year.
Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam appearing on behalf of Attorney General made these remarks when the appeal petition pertaining to the SAITM issue was taken up before Supreme Court.
Rajaratnam further stated that a nine-member-committee has been appointed to look into the progress of implementation of these recommendations.
The Court directed the Attorney General to make the court aware regarding the progress through a motion.
On a previous occasion a majority of a divided three-judge-Supreme Court Bench granted special leave to appeal with a petition filed by Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) challenging the judgment of Court of Appeal to register a student of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe provisionally as a medical practitioner in terms of section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance.
A Supreme Court three-judge-Bench headed by Justice Eva Wanasundara fixed the matter for argument on November 21. However, Supreme Court Judge Priyantha Jayawardena yesterday declined to sit on the bench citing personal reasons regarding this appeal application.
On a previous occasion, the Supreme Court had allowed Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) to intervene into the Appeal filed by the SLMC. Through this appeal petition, the SLMC sought an order to set aside the judgment dated January 31, 2017 by Court of Appeal.
The petitioner further sought an interim order to stay the operation of the judgment made in the writ application bearing No.CA Writ 187/2016 by Court of Appeal.
Delivering its judgment on the writ petition filed by a MBBS graduate of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe, the Court of Appeal on January 31 held that SAITM is empowered to grant MBBS degrees and further held that the petitioner has legal rights to register at the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) as a medical practitioner in accordance with the Medical Ordinance.
The Court of Appeal had observed that the petitioner, a MBBS graduate of SAITM has no obstacle to register at SLMC as a medical practitioner in terms of the section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance.
The Court of Appeal observed that on or around August 30, 2011, the former Higher Education Minister recognised SAITM as a degree awarding institute in terms of section 25 (A) of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978.
The Court of Appeal further observed that the Higher Education Minister has not taken any steps to revoke the concerned decision in terms of the Section 27 of the said Act.
SAITM is empowered to grant MBBS degree, the Court observed.
In its judgment, the Court of Appeal observed that the SLMC has no power to take over the functions of the Higher Education Minister and further observed that the SLMC had acted in violation of Section 19 of the Medical Ordinance when making regulations relating to SAITM.
The Court further held that the SLMC had acted in violation of the Medical Ordinance without having any power to do so.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the SLMC. Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva with Sugath Caldera appeared for the respondent. Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam PC appeared on behalf of the Attorney General.

Ahead of First Test, India focus on reverse sweep, short balls
KOLKATA: Facing short balls and playing reverse sweeps against spinners were the highlights of Indian teams training session as they geared up for the three-Test series against Sri Lanka.
The Indian team support staff was seen giving throwdowns of short pitch deliveries as the likes of Ajinkya Rahane, Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul and skipper Virat Kohli warmed up for their first training session ahead of the Eden Gardens Test here on November 16.
Rahane was the longest to take the throwdowns that went on for about half an hour. He was seen tested by short-pitch stuff, an indication of what lies in store for the India team when they go for a two-month long tour to South Africa, which will comprise three Tests, six ODIs and three T20Is.
At the nets, India followed their batting order with Rahul and Dhawan setting the tone, facing alternate spin and pace bowling.
While the Indian left-right handed duo mainly played in the Vs with occasional reverse sweep, middle-order batsman Rahanes stint at the nets was peppered with the unorthodox shot to the likes of Ravichandran Ashwin and Kuldeep Yadav, hinting their strategy against Rangana Herath and Lakshan Sandakan.
Hours after landing, skipper Kohli was seen in full flow during the two-and-half-hour practice. He started off with a few drills like stretching, one-legged jump.
Kohli also took the throwdowns and faced some short-pitched deliveries before heading to the nets, where he too approached spinners with the reverse sweep shot.
Wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha however chose to play it down, saying, Its how you react to a particular ball. Its not that we have planned differently for a particular bowler. Theres no compulsory shot like that.
Later Rohit Sharma, who had scored his ODI world record 264 runs here three years ago, inspected the pitch. Even Rahane and coach Ravi Shastri had a look at the strip individually.

Basil requests to transfer  almanac case from HC  Judge Gihan Kulatunga
Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa sought an order from Colombo High Court to transfer the controversial almanac case from High Court Judge Judge Gihan Kulatunga to another High Court of Colombo.
High Court Judge Judge Gihan Kulatunga announced that he would make an appropriate order in this regard, on November 15.
The Court was informed that Basil Rajapaksa had filed a Transfer Application in the Court of Appeal, seeking an order staying any further proceedings into the controversial almanac case before Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga, currently presiding at Court No.6 of the Colombo High Court.
Meanwhile, Senior State Counsel Sudarshana de Silva appearing on behalf of the Attorney General raised objections at the request, citing that the defence was purposely attempting to postpone the hearings. He further added that so far there is no order by the Court of Appeal regarding this transfer application and moved the High Court to proceed with the trial.
High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga is the Colombo High Court Judge who delivered the judgment regarding Controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sill) distribution case. Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to three-year-rigorous imprisonment by Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to TRC.
Defence Counsel appearing on behalf of Basil Rajapaksa stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC), which initiated an inquiry against him. He further stated that one of the primary grounds on which the proceedings before PRECIFAC are sought to be challenged by him before the Court of Appeal was thatt he was denied a fair hearing at the purported inquiry by the PRECIFAC.
Accordingly, the case filed against two accused including former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa for allegedly misappropriating Rs.29.4 million of funds belonging to Divi Neguma Department was yesterday re-fixed for trial on November 15 by Colombo High Court judge Gihan Kulatunga.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against the former Minister and former director General of Divi Neguma Department Kithsiri Ranawaka in the Colombo High Court for allegedly printing 5 million almanacs with the image of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, costing Rs.29.4 million, to be used as election propaganda material, during January-2015 Presidential election.
The Attorney General alleged that by printing these almanacs between 23 November and 31 December 2014, these accused had attempted to influence citizens of this country to vote for presidential candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa. The AG maintained that the act of the accused deems him guilty of the offence of bribery in accordance with the section 79 of the Presidential Election Act No 15 of 1981.
Furthermore, the two accused had been charged under the Public Property Act No 12 of 1982 to file misappropriation charges. The AG had listed 32 people as witnesses in the case.
Senior State Counsel Sudarshana Silva appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Anil Silva with Jayantha Weerasinghe PC appeared for the accused.

Thor: Ragnarok
Bold and outrageous
One thing which strikes you about Taika Waititis Thor: Ragnarok is the uniqueness of how the story unfolds. More vibrant than its two prequels, and combined with a quirky sense of humour, it reunites us with two larger-than-life superheroes - Thor and the Hulk. From the outset, its evident how well these two play with, and against each other, continuing their love-hate bromance established in the first Avengers film.
Following the events of Age of Ultron and Thor: The Dark World, the titular God of Thunder searches for his missing father, Odin, who was discreetly overthrown by Thors trickster brother Loki and dumped on Earth. Upon finding him, however, Thor and Loki must contend with the newly awakened Hela, the Goddess of Death and Odins secret firstborn. See, she helped conquer the Nine Realms with Odin eons ago, but was promptly discarded and imprisoned once Odin found her too hawkish for Asgards good; now released, Hela plans to take back the throne, overpowering Thor and Loki and throwing them out into space
Waititis trademark style of comedy is evident in every frame and dialogue. It translates very well onto the screen in all the performances from the ensemble cast. Considering that the odds are stacked against him, Thor is challenged in a way that brings a whole new side to the God of Thunder. Chris Hemsworth get the opportunity to challenge himself sans his powerful axe which is destroyed by his sister Heal. The scenes between Mark Ruffalo and Thor are captivating to watch and will leave you wanting more. Tom Hiddleston is up to his usual charming mischief as Loki. Newcomer Tessa Thompson proves her acting prowess as the spirited and feisty Valkyrie. Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett stand out in the scene. Marvel has brought forth its first female villainess in Hela and she does not cease to disappoint us. The action is fast paced and gripping. There is not a moment for us to become bored by gazing at the screen. Though the scenes are a mixture of comedy and the serious, the dialogs do not stoop to slapstick comedy.
It is a wonder that Marvel managed to outshine Wonder Woman but with hor: Ragnarok Waititi bhas managed to accomplish this deed.

Budget 2018 has NCCSL support
National Chamber of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) said that they are happy with the 2018 Budget and said that it has several meaningful proposals that would encourage business development in the country.
Its not an election-oriented Budget and is not a one with lot of goodies. It has long-term policies and proposals that would help leap frog the economy, said NCCSL President Sujeeve Samaraweera.
We sincerely expect successful implementation of these efforts by the Government which is an important imperative towards achievement of the objectives of the Budget moving forward. However, it would be challenging for the government to provide an enabling environment to implement the said proposals and NCCSL would monitor the progress of implementation and provide an assessment next year, Samaraweera said.
Speaking at event held their auditorium to analyze the Budget, he said that the introduction of the new concept Enterprise Sri Lanka is praiseworthy.
Asked to comment on the concerns of the shipping industry, he said that the government must open up the industry to foreign companies, but must also look after the interests of the Lankan companies as well. We hope the government and stakeholders of the shipping industry would have more discussions in this regard before the final implantation.
When asked what they feel about the Madamulana tax, he said that they feel that the government must be consistent on taxes.
Additionally, the government is proposing to set up a development bank to support the financial needs of the SME Sector by allocating Rs 10 billion.
Asked if the NCCSL is for the removal of tax on beer cans, Bandula Dissanayake, Secretary General/CEO, NCCSL, said yes and that they also support the request made by others to reduce the price of the bottle of gal arrack.
The Government is suggesting trade liberalization measures by introducing around 1,200 para tariff lines to be removed which would bring in both a positive and negative impact on the economy.
The IT sector has been given greater attention with the intention of increasing foreign earnings reaching US$ 5 million in the years to come. Under this programme, small to medium IT start-up companies are to be supported by allocating Rs. 3 billion over the next five years through the Export Development Board and we also expect some of the three-wheeler drivers who are tech savvy to diversify to IT-related businesses, said Deputy President, NCCSL, Nadeeka Buddhipala.
The National Chamber observes the policy inconsistency in revenue streams of the government; the expectation of the business community was to have a consistent mid-term policy on government revenue streams rather than short-term ad-hoc revenue policies such as the debt payment levy imposed on the banking sector and levy on telecom towers.
Under the Blue Economy programme the encouragement extended for deep sea
fishing and infrastructure facilities development proposals for the fisheries sector is also appreciated, the NCCSL said.
Meanwhile, the Budget speech has confirmed that the government would introduce anti-dumping laws in the near future, which would be a positive measure in protecting domestic industries.
As the National Chamber, we appreciate measures taken through the Budget in these areas which has been consistent emphasis of ours during last couple of years, the NCCSL said.

Call for IP laws to bolster Sri Lanka tourism
Sri Lanka should use intellectual property rights and laws to bolster its tourism industry, Director General of Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), Colombo, Malraj Kiriella said yesterday.
Kiriella and others were gathered at the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management for the launch of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Study Report on Intellectual Property (IP) in Tourism and Culture in Sri Lanka, authored by Dr. N. Sampath Punchihewa of the University of Colombo.
We have 72 tourist shops, 53 spa and wellness centres and 33 spice gardens. So these are the areas we need to protect with patents specifically, and innovations to protect their rights, Kiriella said.
Tourism industries which Kiriella said could benefit include ayurvedic medical tourism, under which yoga and meditation fall; agro-tourism and organic tourism; and heritage tourism, which emphasizes the historical and cultural sites of Sri Lanka. As well, IP could aid in the development of new tourism products in the country, including a flying boat museum in Koggala, a Silk Road by the Sea museum, an international cricket museum, a transport museum in Ratmalana, an Asian war museum in the north, and more.
Kiriella said that SLTDA is currently looking into how to best adapt these practices of IP into their curriculum.
Representing WIPO from Geneva, Francesca Toso said that tourism is indeed an engine for sustainable local development, and that intellectual property is a tool for wealth creation.
Intellectual property has positioned itself as an effective tool to enhance the competitiveness of enterprises, to inform public policy and debate on sustainable development choices, and also to enrich knowledge and skills with regard to the use of intellectual property, said Toso.
WIPO is one of 17 specialized agencies that falls under the United Nations. In 2013, Sri Lanka was one of three countries - alongside Egypt, Ecuador, and Namibia - to be selected as a beneficiary project for WIPOs Intellectual Property in Tourism Project. The three-year project is expected to be completed in 2018.

Ceylon Chamber welcomes 2018 Budget, urges focus on monitoring effective implementation
The proposed 2018 National Budget progresses the recent economic policy visions of the government. There is a distinct move in the 2018 Budget towards putting into action strategies outlined in Vision 2025 and the Prime Ministers economic policy statement of October 2017.
This is particularly the case with initiatives such as boosting trade and investment, improving housing ownership and the development of SMEs. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce welcomes the proposals to drive Sri Lanka to becoming a more environmental-friendly economy with an emphasis on improving access to finance for the development of enterprises, SMEs and start-ups.
Focus on Macroeconomic stability
While we see many proposals complimenting the medium-term vision of the government beyond 2018, it is important that the government does not waiver in the near-term from the current fiscal consolidation path. The budget deficit target of 4.6% of GDP set out for 2017 in last years budget is expected to miss its target by 0.6% in 2017. While this is due to a higher interest expenditure than forecasted, it would have been mitigated if revenue grew as forecasted with the successful implementation of revenue proposals in the 2017 Budget.
The aim to reduce the deficit to 4.8% in 2018 is a less ambitious target compared to previous years and is attainable if the tax revenue measures proposed in the 2018 budget are implemented. This aim will be complimented by the new Inland Revenue Act which is expected to come into effect from 1st April 2018. The continuation of fiscal consolidation will support monetary policy and help develop the recent improvement in macroeconomic stability with the build-up of reserves and improvement in the balance of payments.
Implementation mechanisms
We welcome the initiative by the Finance Ministry to set up an Implementation Unit to monitor the progress of the proposals outlined in the speech. We look forward to the operationalization of such a unit given a similar proposal was announced in the 2017 Budget as well with a committee proposed comprising of members of the private and public sector to monitor the implementation process.
It is important to have confidence that the government is serious about each of the many proposals announced in the 2018 budget. Too often we have seen ambitious and laudable proposals confined to the budget speech with the lack of implementation creating an environment of policy uncertainty. There is a lack of attempt made to implement and honour these pledges. Some previous proposals that have remained unimplemented in recent budgets, are repeated in the 2018 budget. We call on the government to take serious steps to implement the announced proposals so as to improve the credibility of government.
Consultative approach in implementation
We hope that the outputs and outcomes of the Implementation Unit will be available to the public as reported and include regular consultations with private sector organisations. The Ceylon Chamber is willing to engage with this proposed unit to provide feedback and input from the private sector on proposals that offer value to industry. It is important for the proposed policies to be operationalised with specific timelines put in place beyond preliminary indications outlined in the 2018 Budget speech. The above steps will help restore and renew public and investor confidence that the desired targets will be met as planned.
Certain concerns
While there is less ambiguity in a majority of the proposals, certain measures could have a negative impact on industry if implemented as mentioned in the 2018 Budget. Measures to raise revenue through new levies (Special Levy for Debt Repayment and Cellular Tower Levy) could adversely impact industries that are also facing regulatory, investment and external challenges. Proposals such as this and removal of para tariffs, reforming existing laws/acts and VAT exemptions (such as in the sale of condominium housing units) will require further clarification and input from the private sector before implementation.
We also recommend the government progress their renewed commitment in State Owned Enterprise (SOE) reforms and Capital Market development through the divestment in holdings of non-strategic enterprises, with a credible plan of action. Initiatives in shifting towards electric vehicles must be supported by a long-term energy plan that will complement the end objective of using non-fossil sources.
Repositioning the purpose of national budgets
The National Budget should not be viewed as an all-encompassing policy document of the government. Instead, National Budgets should focus on actionable outcomes within the relatively short time period of a year while facilitating the long-term vision. Further, National Budgets should shift from imposing overnight tax changes that have proved in the past to be of a disruptive nature for businesses and instead, aim to provide grace periods for implementation of medium to long-term tax plans. The 2018 Budget provides a good foundation for budgets to be viewed in this light.

Green light for new Constitution
Bishop of the Methodist Church should be congratulated for his reminder to the people of this country, specially the politicians and the Buddhist organisations and monks who agitate and propose demonstrations to protest against the proposed new Constitution, when he says as reported in your issue of November 9. The Methodist Church appreciates all political parties that have remained involved in the process of an exercise of drafting a new Constitution without giving into attempts made by certain politicians and religious personnel to bring to a halt a mandate that the people of this country gave at the elections held in 2015.
He also states, both, Mahinda Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirisena in their election manifesto had pledged the people of a new Constitution.
This fact very unfortunately, a few Buddhist monks who claim to be the saviours of Buddhism and the country have forgotten intentionally, to create an anti-government movement. Do we want the 13th Amendment forced on us by Rajiv Gandhi to remain, which brought a division of the country
Power hungry politicians and few self-made leader Buddhist monks for their personal gains which they had enjoyed under the previous regime, have come to the fray, neglecting their own responsibility to safeguarding, fostering and propagating Buddhism. I refrain from naming them for it will tarnish the image of the famous temples and Bo-tree which we Buddhists venerate, whoever the custodians are.

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC has reported profit of Rs 19.718 billion before VAT and NBT on financial services for the nine months ending September 30, 2017, a growth of 20.25% on strong operational gains and tight control of expenditure.
Profit before tax grew by 16.88% to Rs 16.232 billion, amidst an increase in the VAT rate on financial services from 11% to 15%. Profit after tax for the nine months was up 15.01% to Rs 11.675 billion, the countrys benchmark private bank said in a filing with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
Gross income for the period at Rs 84.568 billion reflected an improvement of Rs 17.700 billion or 26.47% over the first nine months of 2016, with interest income growing by 30.03% to Rs 75.669 billion.
Interest expenses increased to Rs 47.427 billion growing by 39.75% principally due to an increased demand for fixed deposits in the review period, resulting in net interest income growing by 16.44% to Rs 28.242 billion.
Fee and commission income increased by 28.67% to Rs 7.330 billion and as a result net fees and commissions made a significant contribution, increasing by 29.03% to Rs 6.151 billion.
Commenting on the Banks performance at the end of the third quarter, Commercial Bank Chairman Dharma Dheerasinghe said the Bank had restricted the growth of expenses to 6.88% - just Rs 949.114 million more than that of the corresponding period of last year. We continue to improve the quality of our loan book leading to further reductions in our NPL ratios and focussed on growing volumes in core business areas, he said.
Commercial Bank Managing Director Jegan Durairatnam noted that the Bank ended the nine months with capital ratios that were substantially higher than those required under Basel III which came in to effect in July this year.
Commercial Banks assets grew by Rs 86.785 billion or 8.57% over the nine months to Rs 1.099 trillion as at September 30, 2017.

CPC failed to maintain stocks: Cabinet Sub-Committee reveals

The three-member committee appointed by the President Maithripala Sirisena to investigate the cause of the Island wide fuel shortage revealed that Ceylon Petroleum Corporation officials who knew of the impending crisis had not maintained the existing stocks.
On an average day, Sri Lanka has a storage capacity for nearly 120 000 Metric Tons (MT) of fuel when our daily requirement is only 2000 MT, said Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, a member of the committee.
However all systemized inventories had been ignored and stocks had not been maintained at these facilities.
He added that there had been no inventories and neither were higher-ups informed of the impending shortage. We did a graphic representation and found that by October 17, many knew of the impending crisis, but none had informed the management.
When asked if sabotage was suspected, the Minister added that it had not been ruled out and that an impartial inquiry should be undertaken to ascertain who the culprits are.
When I was the Minister, during the 100-days program, we increased our storage capacity from 60 000 MT to 90 000. LIOC can store up to 15 000 MT and we have an additional 8000 MT at the depot, he said.
We knew when stocks were running low and we had enough time to work out a new shipment.
The Minister elaborating further added that a minimum of 21 days is required to procure and bring into the country another stock and it could have been done, had the higher management were alerted of the situation on October 17.
The report on the fuel crisis signed off by Minister for Special Projects Dr. Sarath Amunugama was presented to President Mathripala Sirisena at the cabinet meeting in parliament yesterday. The Ministerial sub-committee was appointed by the President to investigate the cause of an island wide fuel shortage. The committee comprised of Ministers Champika Ranawaka, Dr. Sarath Amunugama and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa.
Among some of the recommendations proposed, it has been suggested that the systemized inventory be utilized again since it provides sufficient notice and time to procure new stocks.
We need to make optimal and efficient use of the storage facilities. This way even if there is a surge in demand, the stocks maintained would suffice.
When asked if the Trincomalee oil tanks could be used, as proposed by the Unions, Minister Ranawaka added that while it was a viable option it wasnt the solution.
The tanks need rehabilitation and refurbishment, while it can be done, we dont need it as our storage capacity is sufficient.

From better water and sanitation to increasing technical knowledge and empowering women, people in these rural areas should see a marked improvement in their lives. We are very pleased to partner with both the Government of Sri Lanka and a number of civil society organizations in this initiative, partnerships that will ensure that the assistance provided makes a lasting difference in people's lives."
This grant, which is a part of the EU's wider program of support to rural development in Sri Lanka, will benefit rural communities in the Monaragala, Badulla, Nuwara Eliya and Matale Districts. The program is expected to be operational for five years (2017-2022). The program will be implemented by five partner organizations.
Specifically, CARE will assist in establishing and strengthening Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that are led by women and youth from rural and estate communities. In addition, they will aim to increase their participation in decision making around employment creation, business development and economic growth of the rural and estate sectors.
ACTED will aim to create jobs and increase income levels by building capacity and bringing value-addition to local farming SMEs, specifically targeting women-led businesses in dairy, vegetables, floriculture, fruits and spice value chains. Additionally, the project will promote a business enabling environment for SMEs, by strengthening local business support services and engaging local governance actors in integrated, climate-resilient and inclusive coordination mechanisms and economic development planning.
Oxfam's work will entail improving income and providing work opportunities. In addition, emphasis will be put on integrating women in economic activities. Activities include increasing veterinary services and dairy markets, improving potato seeds, cinnamon and cocoa production. The project will train civil society organizations and local government authorities to better engage in policy discussions on how to support entrepreneurs.
Adventist Development and Relief Agency and Stichting Solidaridad, will work with the rural and estate communities to increase access to water and sanitation facilities, improve personal hygiene and sanitation practices, and strengthen public authorities.

Ex-Test cricketer Gamini Wickremasinghe reminisces on Nelson Mendis
Gamini malli started his career at St Johns Panadura. During a cricket final between two rival schools, Gamini represented St Johns Panadura at a very young age, he played extremely well in that encounter which caught the eyes of the big wigs at Ananda and Nalanda, and they were keen to enrol him to their respective teams because of his cricket. Before this Gaminis father was not too keen in his son pursuing a career in cricket but eventually with this performance of his, the father changed his mind and Gamini opted to join Nalanda College, which has a history of producing batsmen of sheer class. Incidentally Gaminis father worked at the Ports Authority and his mother was a school teacher.
In 1977 when he was 11 years old, Nelson Mendis spotted him keeping at under 13 practices and noted that he had natural talent as a wicket keeper and, at the time Mendis was in charge of junior cricket at Nalanda.
Gamini stated that he was so overawed by Nelson Mendiss sheer personality which Nelson inculcated during his Army days, which led Gamini to treat his coach as a God. Nelson was not only interested in the technical aspects of cricket but also was a strict disciplinarian. He even went to the extent of checking the reports of his charges to monitor the progress they made in their studies and called the teachers and informed them that they should have additional classes in order to facilitate them to pass the compulsory subject maths. He was keen on the students passing the exams, and the students who were selected for special attention were Roshan Mahanama, Sanduna Kapugeekiyana and Gamini himself.
Whilst playing for Nalanda first XI, Nalandians Roshan Mahanama, Asanka Gurusinha and Gamini Wickremasinghe, himself toured Australia. In that particular tour, six of the schoolboy cricketers went on to represent Sri Lanka and Gamini recalls some of them as Roshan Mahanama, Aravinda de Silva (D.S.Senanayake), Marlon von Haght (St Anthonys Kandy), Don Anurasiri (Sri Sumangala, Panadura), and himself. For the Australians Gamini can remember about five of them who represented Australia including Steve and Mark Waugh twins and Mark Taylor.
After that tour Gamini played two years under Kushan for Nalanda College and Thilanga was then the vice captain and Gamini can still can remember the brilliant 100 Thilanga scored against S. Thomas at Campbell Place, he was also a brilliant cover fielder recalls Gamini. In Gaminis second year Roshan captained Nalanda and Roshan and Kapugeekiyana were the best openers the schools had in that year. Kapugeekiyana was a star bat then but he could not represent Sr Lanka mainly due to him failing to make the Australian tour.
Gamini is of the view that a wicket keeper should be judged by the way he keeps to the spinners due to the fact that in a short space of time he has to react to nicks, wides, balls down the leg side, etc
Nalanda is a big school with a student population of over 5000 stated Gamini and in that vast number there is bound to be students of all sorts such as ones coming from broken homes, awkward backgrounds, rich and spoilt ones, etc, so in this cross section of all sorts Nelson Mendis had to come hard and be strict to put the house in order. Gamini emphasises that Nelson Mendis had no mercy for indiscipline.
Gamini came up with a classic example of how strict N.M. was.
In this incident, Gamini was eating in the canteen after school was over, seated on his due place surrounded by staff and fellow students, in the rush in walked N.M. with a bunch of files firmly clasped to his chest, walking ram rod straight, there was an air of authority when he walked in; Gamini saw him and got up immediately but to his utter surprise in next to no time Gamini was floored by a thundering slap, the sound of it was heard all over Campbell Place, not only was Gamini flat on his back, to add insult to injury, he was pulled up from his neck and brought to a standing position and was firmly told that when you eat you are the king.
Gamini concluded by saying that at present he is in the selection committee together with Graeme Labrooy as the chairman and Sajith Fernando and Gerry Wouterz. He also agrees that there are drawbacks at present and everyone is trying to come out of it and by early January things should be sorted out.
Dinesh Chandimal is captaining the Test side and rightly so after we won that Test series against Pakistan, however we are yet to see him showing the same kind of form in the other two formats of the game. Upul Tharanga unfortunately lacks the charisma and the personality to succeed at the highest level, and of course the slow over rates gives him more marks on the negative column but when it comes to batting and when the going is good, he can rip apart any bowling attack in the world. Interestingly a person who has a lot of clout was full of praise for Niroshan Dickwella he went on to mention that Niroshan is earmarked to be a future captain of Sri Lanka. Thisara Perera shone in the T20, he was aggressive on the field and he has the build to match, let us hope that performance was not a flash in the pan.

Federer back in the groove at Tour Finals
London: Roger Federer made a strong start to his bid to cap his golden year with a seventh ATP Tour Finals title as the Swiss star defeated Jack Sock 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) on Sunday.
Four months after winning Wimbledon for a record eighth time just a few miles across London, Federer is back in the English capital aiming to cap a remarkably successful spell by lifting the silverware at the O2 Arena.In the other match in Federer's group, promising German youngster Alexander Zverev showed his potential with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 win against Croatia's Marin Cilic.When Federer missed last year's Tour Finals through injury, it seemed possible he would never recapture his former glories.
He came into 2017 having missed half of last season due to fitness problems and was without a Grand Slam title since 2012.But the 36-year-old has enjoyed a stunning renaissance, winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon among seven titles -- more than other male player over the last 11 months.
Federer hasn't triumphed at the season-ending Tour Finals since 2011.
But after seeing off Sock in his group opener, the world number two has now won his last 11 matches.That dominant streak has already earned him titles in Shanghai and Basel, and he hopes to maintain that hot streak all the way to the Tour Finals crown next weekend. "It's wonderful to be back, especially after missing last year with injury," Federer said.
"I got off to a great start, but the second set was tight.
"The breaker could have gone either way and in the end he helped me with some mistakes. I'm really happy I got through somehow."With defending champion Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka all absent from the Tour Finals due to injury, Federer and Rafael Nadal are the unquestioned headline acts.Having won the French and US Opens this year, Nadal has matched Federer's unexpectedly dominant run as the old rivals hoovered up all four of this year's Grand Slam crowns.Nadal is already guaranteed to finish as the year-end world number one for the first time since 2013, making the 31-year-old the oldest man to earn that honour.But Nadal's hopes of finally winning the Tour Finals for the first time could be hampered by injury.Nadal, twice a Tour Finals runner-up, is due to open his campaign against David Goffin on Monday, however the Spaniard admits he is still struggling with the knee problem that forced him to pull out of the recent Paris Masters. Speaking after receiving his year-end number one trophy following the Federer match, Nadal said he is ready to give it a go against Goffin. AFP

FORESEEING THE FUTURE
Three decades ago digitalism was not even a meme-fied concept it became in this avant-garde decade. The traditional medium was curbed within the walls of electronic means. Establishing Teleview at a time when VHF was the catchphrase, Sunil Ratnayaka raised a stone in Sri Lankan visual technology three decades ago.
And now three decades later, Ratnayaka owns a granary of expertise and memories. That this decade in our life has witnessed a technological upsurge is something that needs not told repetitively. Yet, in Sri Lanka, not everyone used to be conversant in the language of technology.
I had been there throughout all these developments. I studied changes as well as improvements. I went in search of institutes where I can learn new modes of technology. It was a journey from Singapore to National Association of Broadcasters in the US, Ratnayaka recalls.
Conceptual stages
Keeping his ear to the technology ground, Ratnayaka knew everything happening in the global sphere. He was familiar with the 3D concept years before it actually came to surface. He studied the subject from the conceptual stages to the final product.
When we know technological advancements beforehand, it is easy to become accustomed to it. Creativity changes from time to time. So does technology with the growth of the global village. We might not be able to be on equal terms with the global context, but at least we can get closer.
Can being technology savvy go hand in hand with artistic creativity Ratnayaka calls himself skilled in technology as well as artistic creativity plus entrepreneurial competence. Here is someone who has won numerous awards for his entrepreneurial capacity as well as artistic creativity.
And there is another plus. Ratnayaka has produced about 2000 commercials, most of which have been honoured by various awards.
A commercial comes in various types. It could be teledrama, musical and many other varieties. Whatever it is, it has to be delicate, brief and must be transmitted to a person within a short time. And they demand the best technology.
Sunil Ratnayaka became a brand name owing to his feat with producing Dandubasnamanaya, a teledrama based on Sinhalese heritage.
The role of the Sri Lankan producer needs to change.
Producers role
If someone can dole out money, they easily go for producing a teledrama. That brings them many benefits. Tax exemption and the opportunity to be with actresses are a few among them. That said, there are a few good producers in Sri Lanka.
But the story is different in Hollywood, Ratnayaka muses. A Hollywood producer requires creativity. They know the core, depth and the gravity of the creation. They choose the director, not the other way around like it is in Sri Lanka.
Ratnayakes attempt is to introduce a new mould to the Sri Lankan producers role. With expertise in directing and producing various teleworks, he deems himself fit enough to be a professional producer.
It is said that 50 percent of the global companies close down following a lapse of about five years. I have survived for 30 years. So I think I am professional enough to change the producers role in this country.
Ratnayake has produced the highest number of teledramas with his company being the oldest surviving production house. Dandubasnamanaya has won the largest number of awards in the country. Teleview is in possession of a script bank. They are currently in the process of evaluating them before finalising them for production.
Common question
The problem in Sri Lanka is that you cannot reach the mass market with a high-quality production. We need to give up or adapt to the environment. Otherwise, we cannot move forward. That is the rule of evolution.
But then the common question emerges. What if the cultural core values face danger in approaching the mass market
Culture is a changing aspect. Having said that I think the Sri Lankan culture has some stupid elements. For instance, we do not like girls to go in mini skirts. School principals are repulsed by it. Well, if they can expose themselves at a sports meet or a swimming contest, whats this great fuss As long as you have the private parts covered, that is what matters. A few years ago when a couple engages in some intimacy it drew enough response in Japan. But now they dont care a heck about it.
But the issue with the current mass market is that the audience is happy with a simple storyline involving a love affair. Ratnayakes team roams in a higher plane.
For instance, Bhawathra was the first local science fiction narrative, based on an alien, telecasted.
I am fond of the skies. I am surprised by what is happening in the skies. I am a lyricist. I used to see many things in the skies which others do not see. I used to see compassion, love and many other things. On a different note, I am crazy about Steven Spielberg. His creations influenced me to come up with the Bhawathra concept. I made use of the local belief and folklore to add colour to the aliens character. For instance, the villagers are used to the sight of seeing lights travelling from one mount to another. They used to call it devatha eli. I made the alien travel from one mountain to another. Then there was another belief that deities used to extract milk from the cows. When they are done, the humans have no milk left in the morning. Mudiyanse devathavas work, they used to call it.
Scientific knowledge
Countries like Japan, China and Korea shot to development because they transmitted the scientific knowledge to people. They made the people involved in their scientific programmes. Without scientific knowledge, it is hard to work with people. Influenced by that phenomenon, Ratnayake used Bhawathra to transmit scientific knowledge to Sri Lankans.
Culture needs a wider scope. Things like incest sex are there. We cannot avoid them. We shall not do them. But that does not mean that we shall not let them engage in it. It is a biological requirement. If things like prostitution are not there, the humans would react wildly. People will kill each other. That is why prostitution should be there. We should let them function without harming society in general. And that does not mean we should reach extremes. It should not be pornography.
During the early days of our journey, Sunil Ratnayake was a pillar of strength. As two young Sri Lankans embarked on a revolutionary journey, we would not have produced the first-ever music video Ae Pawasu Loke if not for the support of Ratnayaka and Teleview. He is a truly inspiration personality in the Sri Lankan television and cinematography industries and stands as a true inspiration to young entrepreneurs coming into this industry, much more than this he is a true Sri Lankan, who supports the younger generation and guides them to achieve their fullest potential.
Bathiya and Santhush
An industry veteran with over thirty years of experience, Sunil began his career as a civil engineer who then became a news correspondent for the Rupavahini Corporation. He is now one of the Sri Lanakas renowned television producers as well as an award winning director and songwriter. Starting his entrepreneurial career in 1983, he has received numerous accolades such as Best Teledrama Producer (Dandubasnamanaya) and Most Popular Teledrama Producer (Randoratuwa) for his outstanding work.
After following management courses in Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore, Sunil was inspired to model Teleview around world class business strategies practised by global brands such as Sony and Toyota. He has won numerous creative, business and social awards for his excellence over the years.

Fuel shortage deliberate set up to embarrass Govt - JSS
Jathika Sewaka Sangamaya(JSS) yesterday at a media briefing held at the JSS head office, Pitakotte, urged for a CID investigation on the recent fuel shortage, pointing out that the issue was deliberately set up to embarrass the government. They requested President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to instruct Inspector General of Police to conduct a CID investigation on the issue.
Ceylon Petroleum Cooperation JSS Secretary Ananda Palitha briefing the media alleged that there is a Deputy General Manager of the CPC among others who sabotaged the fuel distribution hence creating an island-wide petrol shortage. Palitha also alleged that these high ranking officers are operating for political agendas or personal endeavors.
He also said that creating a panic among the general public and the mismanagement in the fuel distribution process are the main reasons behind the recent fuel crisis.
JSS Secretary Palitha also requested to allow the officers of the CPC and trade union members to give evidence before the Cabinet subcommittee which was appointed to look into the issue.
JSS is also to submit a letter to the President and the Prime Minister to appoint a committee of experts to look into the issues relating to the fuel purchasing and distribution of the country. JSS Secretary Ananda Palitha explained that several suspicious decisions made by the higher officers created the fuel shortage.
At the time when the first shipment was rejected, the responsible officers must have taken every step to make sure the ship which was to reach Sri Lanka on November 3 came on time. These officers were perfectly aware that there is a storage facility of 50,000 MT available. They could have ordered another shipment when the first shipment was rejected.
These officers did not inform the responsible Minister on the emergency decisions that could have been taken at the wake of a issue like this. The available stocks closing to 23,000 MT were not properly distributed either, Palitha said.
On October 29 there was a disturbance to the machine refining petrol, which also is a suspicious incident.
Then on November 2, a certain high ranking officer took a decision to limit the fuel distribution despite the three day vacation falling after this date. In order to create a panic among the public there was an SMS sent around the country stating that there would be a Trade Union action, Palitha said.
He also said there were plans to delay the fuel distribution of the Neverska Lady vessel by taking a decision to bring the ship to Kolonnawa instead to Muthurajawela refinery.
He also pointed out that the machine that checks the Octane level mysteriously stopped working on the same day the Neverska Lady reached Muthurajawela refinery.
Palitha also said it has been reported that certain groups are still trying to cause disturbances to the fuel distribution.

Allegedly Misusing of public funds
Gamini Senarath,  two others remanded
<U+25CF>Alleged to have invested Rs.4 b illegally out of Rs.18.5 b approved by the Cabinet
<U+25CF>Funds in question allocated for Grand Hyatt Regency Hotel
Three suspects, including former Presidents Chief of Staff, Gamini Sedara Senarath were yesterday ordered to be remanded till November 15 by Colombo Fort Magistrate for allegedly missing public funds by illegally investing Rs.4 billion from the Rs.18.5 billion approved by the Cabinet for a hotel project in 2012.
The Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne made this order in respect of three suspects Gamini Senarath, former Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Managing Director Piyadasa Kudabalage and former Samurdhi Commissioner Neil Bandara Hapuwinna, when they surrendered to court, through their lawyers.
The Magistrate announced that she would make an appropriate order on the next inquiry date after inspecting both legal and incidental material relevant to the case.
Both Prosecution and defence parties were directed to file their written submissions, before today (14).
According to a B report filed before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court, they have been accused of misusing government funds by illegally investing Rs.4 billion from the Rs.18.5 billion approved by the Cabinet in 2012.
The funds in question had been the allocation for the Kollupitiya Grand Hyatt Regency Hotel, to be constructed by Canwill Holdings Ltd, a company affiliated to the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, but had been invested in the Hambantota Hyatt Regency Hotel project.
The prosecution maintained that the Canwill Holdings Ltd is a state-owned public enterprise, set up during former regime, with Rs. 18.5 billion in equity, secured from its major shareholders, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, which has invested Rs. 8.5 billion, and Litro Gas and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) with Rs. 5 billion each.
Presidents Counsel Ali Sabry, Anil Silva PC and Counsel Nalinda Indatissa appearing for the suspects argued that the suspects cannot be charged under Public Property Act citing that the Canwill Holdings is not a state institution.
Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation is a company registered under the Companies Act. Money were invested on a contract by several parties, including Canwill Holdings, EPF and Litro gas Lanka company. No offence has been disclosed against the suspects, Mr. Ali Sabry added.
Meanwhile, Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige ,appearing on behalf of the FCID, denied the claims made by defence that the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation is not a state institution. He stated that the company named Canwill Holdings had been formed by first suspect, in his personnel capacity and he is a shareholder of the company.
On November 9, the three suspects appeared before Court as per an undertaking given to the Supreme Court. However, at that time the defence counsel appearing on behalf of the suspects told Court that their clients were not surrendering to Court, but merely appearing for the purpose of making a statement to the FCID.
Senarath and two others had filed three Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an order preventing the FCID from arresting them n connection with a magisterial inquiry, under the Public Property Act and Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
This petition is to be taken up for support on November 17.
Presidents Counsel Ali Sabry with Anil Silva PC and Counsel Nalinda Indatissa appeared for the suspects. DSG Thusith Mudalige with Chief Inspector Anura Premaratne appeared for the FCID.

Govt. must declare stand on SAITM to SC: GMOA
There is only one option left for President Maithripala Sirisena if the current Health Minister does not extend his support to solve the SAITM issue by accepting the Governments stand on SAITM and acting on it. That is the appointment of a new Health Minister as requested by the Mahanayake Theras, Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, Dr. Aluthge said the Government has failed to present its declared stand on SAITM to the Supreme Court yesterday (November 13) and the Government should definitely present its declared stand on SAITM to the Supreme Court on November 21.
This should be done through the Attorney Generals Department but the current Lawyer who has been assigned for the job does not do it purposely, the GMOA Secretary alleged.
According to Dr. Aluthge, if the Government fails to do so for the second time on November 21, the SAITM issue will affect the country. The Government should inform the Supreme Court through the Attorney Generals Department that it abolished the SAITM and the rest of of the proposals declared to the country. President Maithripala Sirisena should have the power to overpower Ministers Rajitha Senaratne and Lakshman Kiriella who always have a pro-SAITM stand which is now completely opposite to the Governments stand. Former Higher Education Minister S.B.Dissanayake clearly violated both the Medical Council Ordinance No.24 of 1924 and the University Act No.16 of 1978, Dr. Aluthge alleged.

Hair conditioning tips
If you are using a hair conditioner since long and still have lifeless hair, chances are you are doing it all wrong. Well yes, you read that right! Merely shampooing your hair and applying an expensive conditioner thereafter isnt a solution to your dull hair. The real deal lies in caring for your hair in a systematic way.
Heres a step by step guide to enviable hair.
1. Firstly, make sure there are no traces of shampoo left in your hair before you apply a conditioner.
2. Squeeze out a coin-sized amount of conditioner and spread it evenly across both your palms. Now, use your fingers to apply the conditioner all across your hair.
3. Slowly massage the conditioner as you move from top to bottom.
4. Make sure the conditioner does not end up on your scalp. The idea is to only cover the hair in entirety.
5. Wait for the conditioner to set. Often we dont see the result of using a conditioner because we end up rinsing off our hair immeditely after applying the hair product.
6. Lastly, rinse off the conditioner with cold water. Keep washing your hair until your hair feels smooth and not slithery. The Times of India

Hemas achieves revenue growth of 11.6%
Hemas Holdings PLC (HHL) and its subsidiaries achieved consolidated revenue of Rs.23.0 billion, a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 11.6% and profit attributable to equity holders of Rs.1.4 billion, a decline of 8.0% for the six months ending September 30, 2017.
Year to date operating profit reached Rs.1.96 billion, a YoY decline of 5.4%. Despite consolidated revenue growing aided by higher turnover from the healthcare and mobility sectors, group earnings indicate a decline due to our Bangladesh personal care business, pharmaceutical distribution, leisure and travel all facing margin challenges, said Hemas Chief Executive Officer Steven Enderby. The home and personal care sector revenue of Rs.8.1 billion for the first six months ending September 30, 2017, indicates a decline of 2.6% over the previous financial year. Operating profits were Rs.968.7 million, 16.4% YoY decline. Despite the challenging domestic macro environment, Hemas Sri Lanka business reported steady growth in key personal care categories with market shares being maintained across most major categories. The decline in operational performance has been impacted by the Groups Bangladesh operations where bad weather conditions during Q1, the restructuring of its sales and distribution network, increased competition and the expansion of its portfolio resulted in lower margins.
During the six months under review, Hemas consolidated healthcare sector registered revenue of Rs.10.6 billion, a YoY increase of 16.5% whilst operating profit and PAT grew at 8.0% and 18.0%.
The Groups healthcare sector was the main contributor to Group growth year to date. In order to drive future growth, Hemas Pharmaceuticals ventured into regional markets for the first time with its entry into Myanmar during Q2. The renamed and rebranded J.L. Morison Son & Jones (Ceylon) PLC (JLM) to Morison PLC posted a revenue of Rs.1.9 billion and operating profit Rs.282.7 million for this interim period.
The Groups Leisure, Travel and Aviation business recorded a total revenue of Rs.1.6 billion, reflecting a decline of 14.7% YoY for the six months under consideration. Serendib Hotels reported a 5.6% fall in revenue due to decline in occupancies and average room rates primarily due to increase in room inventory. During the second quarter, Serendib Group announced the acquisition of a 51.15% stake of the Lantern Group for an investment of Rs.309.5 million. Travel and Aviation segment indicated a growth in revenue of 1.3%. Overall profitability of this segment continued to be below expectations stemming from travels and hotels. Hemas Logistics and Maritime recorded revenue growth of 54.0% over last year with revenues of Rs.1.3 billion. This growth has been driven by both the Groups agencies and logistics.

Horizon campus science faculty tops 200 students
As one of the few private University campuses in the country with five separate facultys, namely Science, IT, Management, Education and the International Faculty, Horizon Campus recently topped 200 students for their Faculty of Science.
The great demand in the market for their Diploma in Biotechnology and the BSc in Biotechnology offered by the science faculty helped the campus achieve this success.
In order to deliver these two academic certificates, Horizon Campus invested in three fully equipped laboratories that comprises of a bio science research lab, a tissue culture lab and a chemistry lab. These labs not only support learning and research, but also inspire young talents to engage in searching for exciting new discoveries.
Apart from that, a plant house is established to facilitate the research and development on plant biotechnology. A well-stocked library provides students with access to all scientific periodical and references.
Another invest made is in recruiting one of the best lecture teams that has one senior Professor, five academics with PhDs with the rest of the team holding masters degrees in the relevant disciplines taught.
Upul Daranagama, Chairman of Horizon Campus, said With the practice of medicine changing dramatically over the years through pioneering advances in biotechnology research and innovation, millions of patients worldwide currently benefit from therapeutics developed through this practice.
Speaking of the investments in the laboratories, he explained This was a very necessary investment if we were to teach this subject in a proper manner. This is because, hands-on experience is one of the most important aspects in this field. Utilizing our labs, students will have an extensive opportunity to learn many cutting-edge methods and practical skills in planning, executing, analyzing and troubleshooting research protocols and be exposed to various techniques in biotechnology that will prepare them for independence in research settings, learn a comprehensive array of techniques and gain much practical insights that will greatly benefit their future careers.
The two degrees offered at Horizon campus currently teaches all the key areas of bio technology that includes genetics, biochemistry, organic chemistry, bioinformatics, bio diversity and environmental bioresources, cell and tissue culture, molecular biology, immunology and food microbiology.
In conclusion, Daranagama said It is important that private campuses in the country create an impact on society, by inspiring our youth to pursue their talents in the important areas of research and new sciences and technologies that will benefit humankind. This is what we aim to do through our degrees in bio technology.

Hyper snipers: Real dynamite in diapers!
Take it from one who knows and remember this: Kids may be cute but can be extremely manipulative. They will try all types of shenanigans to get what they want out of you! They have an astounding knack for making you feel guilty to get what they want. Many of them are award-winning thespians to boot.
Most times they remind me of Hot Stuff  portrayed in the cartoon above - the little devil comic book character created by Warren Kremer in the 50s. Imbued with a mischievous personality and able to produce fire, Hot Stuff appears as a red child devil who wears a diaper (said to be made of asbestos) and carries a magical sentient pitchfork (referred to as his trusty trident, which is a character in its own right. Much to the consternation of his demonic brethren, Hot Stuff sometimes performs good to irritate them.
Dont be fooled by the tears and tantrums or the guilt when you say no. Remember you are the adult. You are supposed to be in charge. But whoever you are never forget that the brat packs are totally anti-establishment. Oh yes, they are well-aware that they are totally dependent on you. But they do possess some ungrateful, perverse streak in their makeup that clearly displays an antagonistic view of all adults.
Beware! Dont be taken in by them. Never underrate their cunning. They will target your vulnerabilities and use them against you. Besides, they execute the payback very well too. And if you give in once they will try harder to make you give in again. Are we talking here about babies or small children I must agree there is a sort of difference. Babies tend to act for survival, they cry when they need something. But dont be too sure!
Yet small children test boundaries around them to see what they can get away with. Its more about want than need. Little Keshi from a very early age used to try to see what she could get away with especially with her doting aunts or grandmother. I have observed her being given pancakes with ice cream because she couldnt eat the chicken and rice they had made. Ridiculous!
The second I walked into the room she knew that shed been exposed. She and her siblings Rex Tharindu, Moya and Kingco used to get away with the same ploy. The other thing they would do when they were smaller was fake crying. Again the tactic was employed only with their aunts and grandmother.
If they wanted to watch something or get into bed with them, they would start crying. I watched them and told the gullible adults it was just fake. But no, they would always give in and immediately the entire weeping gaggle would go into gales of giggles.
Still, a baby anywhere does make its presence felt. Its shrill cries, drooling mouth and gurgling laughter, can give the onlooker a feeling of ecstasy. There is no greater joy than watching a baby. A baby can melt even the toughest heart. What makes a baby tug at our heartstrings
A baby has only one description. Cute! But hold on a second! The freshness, radiance and delightful gurgles exuded by the little bounders can change dramatically too. That is when the bubbly babble changes into banshee baying and diapers need to be replaced. Reminding one of the most apt descriptions of babies the world has been bequeathed with: A baby is a loud noise at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other.
Ok, so imagine the scene. I am standing in a large Colombo supermarket queue. I am pushing a trolley of groceries while holding a little six-month bundle of someone elses pride and creative joy in my arms. The woman in front of me cant help admiring the bouncy bambino.
Then the well-meaning old soul simply begins drooling over the squirming sensation. Oh, what a sweet baby! How cute! What an angel! I smile politely and thank her for the compliment. Hey I nearly forgot how the adorable little rascal spent three solid hours screaming himself silly before I was forced to take him on this little jaunt.
And still the woman keeps looking at him with great awe and admiration before she pops the dreaded question: Is he a good baby Imagine dear reader, what you might have done in my position. If you are ever in a court of law and are asked a similar question it is essential you plead whatever amendment you like to remain silent.
I mean, lets be honest. Any way you respond could either be constituted as outright perjury or as undeniable proof that you are one of those guardians, the ones who are outwardly pitied but secretly labelled as a failure for having a difficult infant.
I just grin nonchalantly. How do you tell a stranger that whenever the mood gets to the tiny bozo he displays his true colours by working himself into a red-faced rage that tends to last the majority of each day and sometimes night. I have already decided he is in reality a con-artist. Yes, a bald, toothless con-artist who has duped everyone into bringing him home from the hospital to be waited on hand and foot for heaven knows how long.
I think I have solved the problem as far as toddler tantrums are concerned. It is best to ignore the flare up. This will work with some children. Distraction works best with younger toddlers at the onset of a tantrum. And if you cant beat them join them.
If you are at home just join them and make a fool of yourself. Lie on the floor with them, kicking and screaming and turn it into a joke. Lighten up this very normal phase of childhood. But be warned. Some children will find this method even more infuriating, because you are stealing their spotlight!
As I said there is no foolproof technique in dealing with all tantrum throwing toddling tyrants.
There is this fool Clint who tried imitating me by rolling on the floor with little Kingco. Clint was on his knees as he and the toddler stared defiantly at each other. The standoff continued for some seconds. That was until Clint suddenly screamed as Kingco came at him headfirst.
The head-butting toddler got him square on the nose. A second later Clint was rolling on the floor in grotesque contortions, his hands clutching at his crotch. And the moral of my story Never underestimate the reaction of dynamite in diapers. And never raise your hand to kids. It leaves your groin unprotected.

Importance of bringing new Constitution stressed
Leading politicians and members of Civil Society Organizations yesterday stressed the importance of bringing a new Constitution which safeguards the unitary status of the country.
They claim that this is the ideal time to do that since today the country has a moderate Tamil leadership.
They further said that the country may never get another chance if it does not grab the opportunity now.
They were addressing a seminar entitled A new Constitution is Required at the New Town Hall Colombo yesterday, with the participation of the representatives of Health Services Trade Union Alliance.
Justifying the need for a new Constitution, Constitutional Expert and UNP National List Parliamentarian Dr. Jayampathi Wickremaratne said that making a new constitution is very much essential to find a firm solution for long discussed topics of the country, such as the abolition of executive presidency, the question of power devolution.
Dr.Wickreamaratne explained the roles played by the Steering Committees headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Constitutional Assembly, consisting of parliamentarians, and ,the six sub committees in the constitution making process.
Commenting on the report submitted by the sub committee dealing with fundamental rights, headed by Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, Dr Wickreamaratne said that if they were able to add these proposals in the fundamental rights chapter of the new constitution, it will be the best among Asian countries. He further stressed the need of taking into consideration the fact that the Tamil word orumitha naadu is not the correct translation of the word unitary and they would find the most suitable word for that.
Prof. Sarath Weerasooriya said that the People of this country have given a clear mandate to formulate a new constitution at the Presidential Election held in January 8, 2015.
Formulating a brand new Constitution had been clearly mentioned in the election manifestos of the two main presidential candidates , at the Presidential election held in 2015. So nearly 6,200,000 people, who voted for President Maithripala Sirisena and 5,800,000 people who voted for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa have given a clear mandate to do that. Prof Weerasuriya said.
Expressing the UNPs stance on formulating a new Constitution, Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera said that the UNP thoroughly believes that a brand new constitution is needed within the framework of unitary state. We also believe that the utmost place given to the Buddhism should remain unchanged.
He said that the Executive Presidency should be abolished and no more Presidential elections held in the country. He further said that the Executive Prime Minister is only a myth, which doesnt exist anywhere in the world. Only two such attempts of electing an executive Prime Minister has been reported so far and both attempts were not successful.
Expressing his views, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said that some SLFP Ministers have forgotten that SLFP leaders, including late Prime Ministers SWRD Bandaranaike, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, attempted to solve ethnic issue in the country.
I always fought for the abolition of the Executive Presidency, Minister Senaratne said.
He added that devolution of power was not a new topic. It had been spoken of for a long time now. No one could oppose this and call himself a true patriot. There is no other traitor than those who oppose this.
The biggest victory for this Constitution is that the TNA is agreeing to support it, which was an unprecedented opportunity. Therefore, we must grasp this opportunity.
During the Constitutional Council in 1972, the late J.R. Jayewardene proposed the Executive Presidency, but late Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake rejected it.
But in 1978, Late Jayewardene and late R Premadasa set up the Executive Presidency. But late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike pledged that she would abolish it at the first opportunity, they get to do so.
Former Presidents Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa too promised to do so, Minister Senaratne said.
The President of Health Services Trade Union Alliance Saman Ratnapriya also spoke.
